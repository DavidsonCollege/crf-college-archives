licensee. Ford Motor, a 1984-signatory, also sells vehicles to the military and security police. Davidson has holdings in all of the above-named corporations.
It is frequently argued that U.S. corporations in South Africa will serve as agents for progress and peaceful change.Response to this supposition, one should consider the fact that U.S. corporations in South Africa employ LESS THAN 1 PERCENT of all African workers in the country and that multinational corporations focus on capital-intensive, not labor-intensive, forms of production, expanding primarily through technological innovation, rather than through greater employment. In other words, even if all U.S. corporations in South Africa were to fully implement the Sullivan Code, they would affect only a very marginal segment of the African population.

Furthermore, U.S. corporations have been present in South Africa for the last century. It has only been in the last 40 years that apartheid has become the basis of the country’s legal system. U.S. corporations did not prevent the entrenchment of apartheid. Why should we think they will function as progressive agents in the abolition of apartheid now?

Reasons why the Davidson College Trustees should adopt a policy of divestment:

1. The current proposal fails to address the moral issues involved in the presence of corporate enterprises in South Africa. The high rates of profit earned by American corporations in South Africa reflect the benefits they receive from the oppressive nature of the apartheid government. Apartheid weakens the voice of unions and quashes dissent, thus rendering the Africans a poor and submissive labor force. As long as Davidson College maintains holdings in corporations benefiting from this system, it CANNOT deny the fact that it, too, benefits from the exploitation of human beings.

2. Many among the most severely hard-pressed Africans in South Africa and Southern Africa advocate sanctions and disinvestment, even though such actions will cause them to suffer. As has been indicated by their spokespersons (Bishop Tutu, the late Steven Biko, the South African Student Organization, FOSATU—the largest federation of black trade unions, the SADCC, as well as the front-line States), many Africans in South Africa feel that the long-term results of such action will far outweigh the short-term suffering that will occur. To not take these views into account indicates a racial arrogance, reminiscent of the “white man’s burden” theme, on the part of the leaders of our country.

The draft expresses concern that U.S. corporate withdrawal may lead “to even further suppression of human rights under a dictatorial regime.” The majority of the people in the country ALREADY exist under totalitarian rule. Three-quarters of the population have no political rights. The government operates under an elaborate system of social control, with the aid of secret police, censorship, political arrests and detention, torture, and internal passports for those with black skin. The scenario, other than for its racial element, ALREADY mirrors the worst of what exists in the Soviet Union.

3. The Presbyterian Church, U.S.A., has adopted a policy of selective phased divestment. Davidson’s investment policy should reflect its Christian commitment and heritage.

4. Because of the Christian values and code of honor upon which it was founded, Davidson College has an especial responsibility to serve as a model for academic institutions in the South. Unfortunately, we appear to be lagging behind many universities in our own state: Duke, Johnson C. Smith, and N.C. Central are completely divesting; in all likelihood, N.C. State will begin a policy of complete divestment on May 31; UNC has decided to divest holdings in businesses doing “direct and extensive business with the government of South Africa.”

5. After a July 1986 fact-finding mission, TIAA-CREF, the organization managing the pension plan of Davidson College’s employees, has concluded that “the long-term economic interests of its participants would best be served by urging all 160 portfolio companies in South Africa to withdraw from that country as expeditiously as possible.” Continued investment involves great risk, in the face of discontent that has become increasingly widespread over the past two years.

6. After divesting, the University of Connecticut, University of Wisconsin, and Michigan State University have experienced increases in returns on their endowments.

We appreciate the Trustees’ efforts to examine the role of Davidson’s investments in corporations involved in South Africa, and we support the Finance Committee’s endorsement of the establishment of scholarship aid for black South Africans to study here. However, we consider continued investments in corporations doing business in South Africa, especially in those supplying the military and security police (IBM, General Electric, General Motors, and Ford Motor) to be morally unacceptable. We urge the Trustees to follow the example of the Presbyterian Church, U.S.A., as well as of other prestigious academic institutions in the region, by adopting a policy of divestment.
