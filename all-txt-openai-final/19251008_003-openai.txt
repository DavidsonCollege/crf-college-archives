Jack Miller’s slogan is, “Say it with moonshine.” He knows the flowers will come afterwards.

Absent-minded professor to beggar who is holding out hat for alms—"Oh, thank you so much! That's the second time it's blown off today.”

Tom Baker—“I see Margie’s picture on Kelly Woodham’s chiffonier.”
Bus Lawson—“Don’t worry, Tom, that’s just a frame-up.”

Week-end Visitor—“Abe Lincoln is certainly a gallant fellow. Every time he speaks to me he says, ‘Fair lady.’”
Jim King—“Don't kid yourself, dearie, he has been a street-car conductor all summer.”

AIN’T IT THE TRUTH?
“What do you think of the jokes in the Peanut Parcher?”
“Well, I’ve seen most of them before, and those I haven’t seen before I haven't seen yet.”

“Woodrow” Wilson—"May I offer you some refreshments?”
She—"Yes, you might give me a few moments to myself.”

LADY GODIVA
About one hand of strip poker would send most co-eds home in a barrel.

Stage Hand—“Hey, shall I pull down the curtain? The living statue has the hiccups.”

Sims (in restaurant)—“Hey, there!”
Waiter—“Yes, sir; how will you have it?”

An experienced follower of Dan Cupid has just submitted to us his version of love. Here it is: “Love is like a cyclone: You are bothering no one, just walking along, when it comes and hits you. It picks you up, turns you round and round, throws you down hard; then it moves peacefully on, leaving you in an awful wreck.”

“Theatres in Europe are larger than the ones in America, and I have played in them.”
C. E—“Yes, but that is nothing compared to the theatres out west. Why, they are so big there that when a man on a back seat throws an egg it hatches before it reaches the stage.”

Yukk Hall—“Is there any soup on the menu?”
Waiter—“There was, but I wiped it off.”

NAUGHTY SHORTY
Shorty Howell got into a little scrap in Charlotte last Saturday night, and was invited by a kind man in a blue suit to spend Sunday in the “cooler.” He was the first man brought up before the judge on Monday morning.
“Well, what have you got to say for yourself?” asked the judge, “this man charges you with assault and injury.”
“Well, judge, you should have heard what he called me.”
“What did he call you to make you beat him up like that?”
“I just can’t tell you here, judge; but it was an awful name.”
“Come, now, we have no time to waste, what did he call you?”
“Judge, he called me ‘another one.’”

BEAT THIS ONE
We admit that there were some peachy looking skirts out at the game in Charlotte last Saturday, but we have never seen ‘em dumber. One beautiful damsel wanted to know if the man with the little automobile horn honked it to make the players get out of his way.

Norton—“If you don’t hold your head up, I can’t shave you.”
K. Bell—“All right, give me a haircut, then.”

Buck Shaw—“But I tell you that the theatres in Europe are larger than the ones in America, and I have played in them.”

BE PREPARED
Steve Wall—"I have never kissed a girl before.”
She—"Then you have come to the wrong place. I don't run a prep school.”

Burke—“There’s something going around that will interest you.”
She—“Well, be careful; there are some pins in my waist.”

Suspicious Wife—"I smell cloves.”
Hubby—"No, m'dear, ‘Taint cloze, flowrsh on m’ necktie.”

Hotel Clerk—“Do you expect to be called, sir?”Mr. Davis? Count—"No, just call me Count, that's what the boys call me.”
She — “Why do you believe in free love?”
Big ’Un Thompson — “Because I'm broke.”

DAVIDSON vs. QUEENS
Lowrance (just arriving with Queens girl)—“Well, the score is still nothing to nothing.”
Fair Thing—“Then we haven't missed a thing, have we?”

NOT HOMINY GRITS
“I thought you were going to kiss me when you puckered up your lips a moment ago.”
“Er-er-no, you see there was a piece of grit in my mouth.”
“Then for goodness sake swallow it. You need some MILK.”

Wharton—"What makes that red spot on your nose?”
Austin—"Glasses.”
Wharton—“Glasses of what?”

THREE YEARS IS RIGHT
Fresh Alexander—“How long will I have to wait for a shave?”
Barber—“Oh, about two or three years.”

Headline in paper: NUN PUNISHED FOR ROLLING HER STOCKINGS.
Gosh! A genuine Holy Roller!

OH YOU PEROXIDE!
T. T. Jones—“Did you see that wreck last night?”
Falls—“Which one—the blonde?”

Farnsworth (strolling with his girl as Coach Monk passes in his Buick)—“There goes our football coach.”
She—"Oh, isn’t it nice!”

Wood Brown—“Heard a good story today.”
Joyner—“What is it?”
Wood—“Oh, it's too bad to repeat.”

SWEET PAPA!
A moon,
The steps,
A pretty miss,
A man with arms so strong.
An upward glance,
A fatal kiss—
Another good man gone wrong.

EXCITED STUDENTS RIDE
(Continued from page 1)
as successful as those of a one-legged man doing the Charleston. Finally, the “Special” came in sight of Charlotte, and a few boys jumped off and ran on in so they might get there early enough for a seat. The others waited for the train to pull into the station. Special street cars were waiting for the crowd at the depot. Then came the game. At 11 o'clock Saturday night, a tired but happy bunch left Charlotte for Davidson. Some discussed the game, some talked about the dates they had just left, and some few slept. A song was started but was soon called off for lack of energy. “Squad” Joyner, occupying the front half of a smoker, enlivened the other occupants with snappy anecdotes, and then entertained by reading the funny paper aloud to Warren Ogden. So ended the trip as the train pulled into Davidson and the boys struggled toward the dormitories.
