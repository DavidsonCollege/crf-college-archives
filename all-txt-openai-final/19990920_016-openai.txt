After two weeks of mounting frustration and increasing doubts, the Wildcats found themselves in an eerily optimistic predicament—with a 1-2 record after three weeks of play.

Though Tim Landis and his squad are quick to acknowledge that ’99 is a season all its own, fans of Wildcat football enthusiastically recall that last year’s 8-2 season was born from a 1-2 record after week three.

Riding the tide of a reasserted defensive front, the ‘Cats stormed their way to victory, shutting out the University of the South 21-0 atop a sun-splashed Smith Field while tallying the 350th victory in program history.

Sewanee opened their ’99 season with blowout victories over Hampden-Sydney and Rose-Hulman. But in Davidson, North Carolina on Saturday, the Tiger offense seemed every bit as impotent and over-hyped as Hurricane Floyd.

After both teams’ opening drives vanquished into a series of exchanged punts, Davidson blew the game open with an 80-yard touchdown drive. Eric Ferguson totaled 76 rushing yards on the drive, dashing 53 yards downfield on the first play from scrimmage and eventually finishing what he started, diving into the end zone for a two-yard touchdown carry.

“I’ve never been happier for a player.”

Shaun Tyrance keyed the Wildcat offense to a season-high three touchdowns on Saturday.

Ferguson ignited the crowd with that 53-yard scamper (the longest of his career), blitzing through the Tiger line untouched and then effortlessly dragging a helpless Sewanee defensive back for much of the duration of the play. The carry was a premonition of great things to come on that day for the senior from Maggie Valley, North Carolina—Ferguson earned his 2000th career yard, joining Wildcat great Ray Sinclair ’81 as the only Davidson backs in over a hundred years to accomplish this feat.

Shrugging off post-game praise, Ferguson claimed, “It’s really a testament to the offensive line that I’ve run behind for four years. It makes my mom proud, but I take more personal satisfaction from us getting the victory today.”

Given their first lead of the season, the Wildcat defense showed no interest in giving it up. Highlighted by key sacks from Bo Henderson, Andre Carelock, and Kevin Strange, Davidson contained Sewanee on the ground, and shut them down in the air (the only Sewanee pass that did not fall incomplete on the day was intercepted by Donnie Johnson). By the half, the ‘Cats had accrued 201 yards on 30 plays from scrimmage, while limiting Sewanee to but 37 yards on 31 plays.

Davidson struck again early in the third quarter. After junior halfback Jon DeBord carried the ball down to the 1-yard line, Ferguson capped off the drive with his second touchdown of the day. Freshman Daniel Hanks knocked the subsequent extra point, extending the ‘Cats lead to 14-0.

The final score of the day came courtesy of the Wildcats’ notorious special teams squad. After the ‘Cat defense snuffed out yet another attempt at a Sewanee drive, the Tigers were forced to punt out of their own end zone. Junior Corey Crawford blocked the punt, and junior Adam Stockstill scooped up the ball for another Wildcat touchdown.

“I kind of challenged the punt team this week, teasing that we hadn’t gone two weeks without a blocked punt in a long while,” said Landis. His team answered the challenge. “We had great punt coverage today, the best performance I’ve seen in the past two years.”

After two weeks of platooning with a pair of freshmen, junior quarterback Shaun Tyrance reasserted his role as the director of the Wildcat spread option offense. Tyrance ran the option beautifully, keeping the Sewanee defense ever off balance. “I’ve never been happier for a player,” praised Landis, remarking on the junior’s sustained success after a pair of knee surgeries.

Davidson travels Saturday to Emory & Henry, a team that handed the ‘Cats one of their only two losses in ’98. “It’s a big game against our long-time nemesis,” said Landis. “We haven’t beaten them in seven years, and they haven’t lost a home game in something like forty games.”

“We’ve got everyone fired up,” said Ferguson, looking ahead to Saturday’s clash. “Hopefully it will just be momentum building upon momentum.”
