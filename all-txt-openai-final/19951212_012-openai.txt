Turkey from page 10

...would be the wild turkey.

It was probably a tradition for the men of the family to go into the woods and hunt the bird,
but, eventually, that tradition was lost. The wild turkey was so abundant and “American” that some proposed it be the
national bird, but due to habitat loss, the wild turkey dwindled in number so much that it existed in only
the most remote areas.

A tradition was nearly lost, but, more importantly, a magnificent bird was almost lost. Thanks to extensive relocating efforts of
Fish and Game departments across the country in conjunction with the National Wild Turkey Federation, we once again can see
the wild turkey out in the open.

Hunters from all over are catching the bug much like I did that autumn morning, and now I am an
avid turkey hunter. Although most turkey seasons are in the spring, many states are opening fall seasons as wild turkey
numbers continue to rise.

The rewards of hunting wild turkeys are many. Not only is the turkey cunning and hard to outwit, but when
you finally outsmart one, you will quickly realize that its table fare is much greater than that of its farm-raised
cousin.

Just seeing one of these stately birds in the wild paints a picture in my head of Thanksgivings past, reviving
the warm thoughts of being with family and giving thanks for the bounty which nature offers.

B-ball from page 10

Earlier in the week on Tuesday night, the Wildcats suffered their first loss of the season, losing on the road
to UNC-Wilmington 73-56.

After a first half in which both teams shot horrendously, the Seahawks solved their shooting woes in the second half,
coming back from a 24-22 deficit to rattle off 51 points. Conversely, Davidson’s problems continued and UNC-Wilmington won convincingly.

The Wildcats converted just 31 percent from the floor, but the Seahawks shot 47 percent. Davidson next faces Fairleigh-Dickinson on
Saturday at 3:30 p.m. in Belk Arena.
