#### Beyond Davidson
**Busy week; tons o’ stuff**

By HOLLY HAYES and ED POWELL

**Congress:** A controversial 51% congressional pay raise was voted down by the House on Tuesday after public pressure forced congressmen to re-evaluate the proposal. The pay hike, which would have increased congressional salaries to $135,000, would have gone into effect at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday had it not been rejected in a voice vote. House Speaker Jim Wright scheduled the vote when it became apparent that the pay raise did not have the support originally assumed among congressmen and when outraged citizens questioned its necessity.

**Executive:** On Monday, the President’s chief ethics advisor and general counsel C. Boyden Gray resigned as chairman of his multi-million dollar family company and placed his personal assets in a blind trust to avoid conflict of interest charges. Promising that his administration will “aspire to the highest possible ethics standards,” Bush reasserted his support of Gray, who had been the former vice-president’s counsel for eight years.

The nomination of John Tower to Secretary of Defense has been impeded by ethical considerations as well. The Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) has questioned Tower’s ties to defense agencies and has expressed concern with his sexual misbehavior and drinking problems. Bush’s appointee has denied all charges brought against him, but officials say that these allegations could harm his approval if a vote is not called this week.

Secretary of State Jim Baker has declared that he and his family would sell all of their publicly traded stock so as to avoid any conflicts of interest. The controversy arose last week when an examination of his personal holdings revealed his holdings in Chemical Bank, a leading lender to Third World countries. Since the nature of his position involves the shaping of U.S. policy on the Third World debt, Sec. Baker voluntarily withdrew all ties so as to end any further debate.

The judge in Oliver North’s trial ruled last week that the jurors would not be sequestered during the trial proceedings, despite protests by the defendant’s lawyers that this would violate North’s right to an unbiased jury. Finding suitable jurors has proven difficult given the widely publicized nature of the Iran-Contra scandal two years ago.

This week, after months of legal haggling, it appears as if the trial might finally begin. The special prosecutor in the case, Lawrence Walsh, has reached a new agreement with the Justice Department on the release of certain documents. North, a former aide in the Reagan administration, faces felony charges for his role in the sale of arms to Iran and the use of the profits to furnish the Nicaraguan rebels.

**President Bush:** President Bush unveiled his $50 billion savings and loan bailout plan last week. Congressional leaders praised the quick response of the Bush administration to the banking crisis which was shaking taxpayers’ faith in the system. The bailout, an effort to revitalize insolvent banking institutions, would be equally financed by taxpayers and the Treasury Department through the purchase of long-term bonds. Some aspects of the proposal call for tougher government regulations, give the Justice Department the right to crack down on fraudulent S&Ls, and call for the FDIC to absorb the cost of insolvent S&Ls.

The President was in South Carolina on Wednesday, making a “political payback” to the state that had given him a necessary primary win nearly a year ago. Last March, President Bush was in a tight race for the Republican nomination when he arrived in South Carolina for the March 7th primary. His victory in South Carolina was thought to be the stepping stone to his sweep of the remainder of the southern states on Super Tuesday.

The President addressed the joint session of the S.C. legislature, appealing for bipartisan support to his newly proposed 1.16 trillion dollar budget. In his short speech, Bush urged the legislators of both parties to work together towards accomplishing their goals. His speech, to the obvious amusement of much of the legislators, was peppered with allusions to South Carolina history and short anecdotes.

**Local:** 5,000 angry teachers converged on the statehouse in Raleigh on Tuesday. The teachers were lobbying legislators and Gov. Jim Martin for an increase in their salaries and a thaw to the pay scale freeze that has been in effect since 1982. Teachers are upset over the growing gap between the rising cost of living and their lack of increased income to meet it.

**Briefs:** Kitty Dukakis voluntarily entered an alcohol treatment program in Rhode Island over the weekend. Her husband, Michael Dukakis, made the announcement and claimed her drinking problem began after the November 1988 election defeat. Dukakis’ wife has had previous problems with addiction, revealing in 1987 a 26-year dependency on diet pills.

The fried chicken wars may die down now that Popeye’s has acquired Church’s Fried Chicken for roughly $392 million. The merger of the #2 and #3 ranked fried chicken chains will end a 4-year battle between the two. It should also give #1 Kentucky Fried Chicken its first significant challenge in years.
