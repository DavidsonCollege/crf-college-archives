Grapplers Struggle Against

Appalachian, Citadel

By Matt Johnes

Last Saturday’s tri-meet with Appalachian State and the Citadel was a disappointing one for Davidson wrestlers.

The ‘Cats lost both matches by the identical score of 45-3. In the first match, against ASU, the only bright spot for Davidson was freshman Robie Fierro’s 8-6 decision over Lonnie Coleman.

At that point, Davidson was only behind 6-3 in the overall match score, but things quickly fell apart.

In the second match, the outcome had been decided before Davidson was able to score any points.

With the Citadel up 27-0 in the match, Scott Townsend took a 5-2 decision from Matt Coates.

The Citadel swept the rest of the match to register the victory. The Wildcats return to action in Belk Arena February 9 against the Blue Devils of Duke, with matches slated to begin at 3:30 p.m.

Junior Beach Breaks More Records

By Peter Hurtado

This past Saturday, the women’s track team provided a glimpse of things to come. The lady Wildcats began their indoor season with two school records and several outstanding individual performances at the Santee-Marriott Invitational at Virginia Tech.

Heather Tarpley, last year’s High Point award winner, set a new indoor record with a phenomenal time of 1:21.3 for 500m. The team’s most versatile athlete, Heather should contend for records in the hurdles, discus, and 5000m run.

Co-captain Kathy Beach continued to rewrite the record books as well, running a superb 5:21.3 mile for a new indoor record. Last year’s MVP, Kathy placed 5th overall at the meet.

Returning from a successful freshman season, sophomore Jennifer Brown ran a fine 800m of 2:36.4.

Freshman Amy Bertram led the way for the Wildcats in the 3000m run, running an 11:57.4, and promises to have an outstanding season. She was followed closely by senior Laurie Reams in 11:59.0. Both women’s times were among the ten fastest ever run by Davidson women. Freshman Lisa Sitek finished only seconds behind in 12:07.1, and joined the list of the top ten 3000m performers.

Coaches Gary Andrew and Beth Manson have every reason to be excited about the women’s first outing, and look forward to further improvement. The return of several women from early illness and injury will only add to their success.

Men's Track Flourishes In End

By Peter Hurtado

1991 could be the year the Wildcats rewrite the record books. In an exciting start to the season, the men’s track team returned from the Santee Marriott Invitational at Virginia Tech this past weekend with a school record and several of the fastest performances in recent years.

Freshman sensation Duncan Spears highlighted the meet for Davidson with a school record performance in the 500m. Duncan’s blazing time of 1:09.3 eclipsed the old record of 1:09.5 set in 1981.

Just behind Duncan was freshman David Stewart in a time of 1:12.3. Both freshmen showed great poise in their first ever collegiate races.

Captain Ted Richardson posted an impressive time of 15:52 in the 5000m run. Ted was followed by Dave Kerns at 16:07. These two men turned in the 2nd and 3rd all-time fastest indoor 5K times for Davidson men, and look to continue their fast pace.

Sophomore Ben Wiley ran a fast 1000m, covering the distance in 2:42.7. Ben hopes to carry this solid performance into the outdoor season.

Freshman Wendell Robbins sprinted to the fastest 55m performance (6.88) in recent years, and added a promising 200m effort as well.

John Moss, the only senior on this young squad, posted a fine time of 9:33 in the 3000m run.

The mile crew of Peter Hurtado (4:36), freshman Cam Dauler (4:39), and freshman Richard Wharton (5:02) also began their indoor season with strong performances.

The men ended the meet with a flourish, running the 4th fastest indoor 4x400m relay time ever for a Davidson squad. The squad of Spears, Hurtado, Dauler, and Wiley was led by Spears’ quick lead-off leg of 53.3.

A spirit of excitement and energy surrounds the men’s team. The addition of many talented freshmen to the core of solid returning runners should make this season one to remember. Records have begun to fall and should continue right into the outdoor season.

The men’s track and field team continue competition this weekend with meets in Lynchburg, VA and at ETSU.
