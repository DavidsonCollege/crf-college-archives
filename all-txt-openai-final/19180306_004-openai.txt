Lieut. A. S. Tompkins, ex-'16, has been ill with pneumonia at Camp Wadsworth, Spartanburg, S. C., but is now convalescent. His parents, returning from a visit to him, were on one of the trains wrecked near Columbia last week, and Mr. A. S. Tompkins, Sr., was painfully injured.

One of the 52 Y. M. C. A. workers who sailed for France from an Atlantic port recently was Robert W. Miles, ’11, of Richmond, Va. Mr. Miles was assistant Superintendent of City Playgrounds in that place before enlisting for war work of the Y. M. C. A.

The following are extracts from a letter received on the Hill recently from L. H. Patterson, ex-'18, otherwise known as “Pep,” and now a member of Company B, 65th Engineers, Camp Meade, Md.:

“I am up here at Annapolis on rifle range, getting ready to go over. We sail real soon and I am very glad. I am very well trained and would not be out of this for the world. I love my work very much. We are in the regular army now, a picked bunch to bring the 65th up to war strength. We will be the new tank unit for the American Army that will go over to lead the tank charges. Consider it the best branch of the service.

“Have been shooting for several days. Qualified for marksman and will shoot sharpshooter course this p. m.

“I may never get back, but I am glad I am going. Remember me to all the boys.”

Special Attention Given

The Debating Council at the University of Florida has been charged with negligence and indifference in allowing a month to go by without announcing the subject for the triangular debate with the Universities of South Carolina and Tennessee. But the Council defended itself and now peace is declared by both sides and the debaters at Florida are working hard over the subject selected.
