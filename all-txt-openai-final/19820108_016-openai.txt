DAVIDSONIAN / Friday 8 January 1982

Jelly Roll Morton said he invented jazz, and he may have been right for he was the genius who took
ragtime and made it hot. Some 25 years after Morton’s death, pianist Bob Greene put together a group in the
mid-60’s that eerily plays Morton’s music note for note. It lives again. “Greene is startling! ... it was Morton himself
onstage.” - New Yorker.

The Intimate P.D.Q. Bach (Friday, February 5; Saturday, February 6; 8:15 pm; $10.00; students, $6.00) Professor Peter Schickele’s hilarious spoof
brings to audiences the music of the heretofore undiscovered (for reasons which will be made clear) son of the great
Johann Sebastian Bach, and proves conclusively that “like father, like son” is not necessarily true. A side-splitting evening.
