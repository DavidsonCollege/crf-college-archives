WITH OTHER COLLEGES.

University of Mississippi—A movement for the tabooing of the cigarette in Mississippi is now engaging the attention of the citizens
of that state and more particularly the students of its State University. Dr. W. S. Leathers, dean of the medical
department, and Dr. Alfred Hume, vice-chancellor of the University, have given their endorsement. Every student and member of the faculty
will be given an opportunity to sign a petition, urging the Legislature to enact such a law. A number of
students who use cigarettes have expressed themselves as eager to sign such a petition.

North Carolina A. & M.—The debating team of the North Carolina A. & M. was victorious in a debate with
Auburn, held in Raleigh, Friday night, January 28. The North Carolina A. & M. will debate with Auburn next year
at Auburn.

University of Louisiana—The Athletic Council of the University of Louisiana has drawn up plans for a new athletic field which
will provide an adequate place for football, track, and baseball. The grouping of the various athletic activities of the University
into one field will be a great step forward.
