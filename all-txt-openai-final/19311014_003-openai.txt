THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER 14, 1931

SEASON FRIDAY FRESHMEN OPEN WITH WOFFORD

THE SPORTS PARADE

BEAT THOSE BLUE DEVILS

The Davidson Wildcats have performed many and strange feats in their day, but strangest of all was that of last
Saturday, when, after holding a lead of 6-0 until the last quarter, they allowed the V. P. I. Gobblers to
score three touchdowns. Very seldom have we heard of the Wildcats weakening in the last quarter, especially after leading for
three previous quarters. The only solution seems to lie in the fact that V. P. I. outweighed Davidson over 15
pounds, man for man, and that the smaller team was simply worn down by the man-mountain machine from Virginia. From
all reports, the Wildcats completely outclassed the Gobblers during the first half, but as reserve strength was sadly lacking, the
regulars couldn't stand up under the strain of constant pressure.

And now comes the news that Mr. Wade and all his tribe of Blue Devils, riding on the waves of
two successive victories over V. M. I. and Villanova, are on their way to hand the Wildcats the worst licking
they could possibly receive. Slow music, please: It may be so and we don’t know. Undoubtedly Duke has a strong
team, and those who saw the game say that their 13-0 victory over V. M. I. was scarcely an indication
of their strength. This conclusion was in some measure vindicated by the machine-like functioning of the Blue Devils against Villanova
last Saturday when they scored a decisive victory of 18-0.

May we point to our 13-12 victory over Duke in 1929 and our 7-6 victory over Carolina in 1930 as
evidences of the 'Cats’ ability to upset the proverbial dope bucket? These two teams were rated as leaders in the
state during the years mentioned, outweighing the Davidson team considerably and possessing reserves galore, but against them the Wildcats displayed
a fighting spirit unparalleled, and a determination to win which was bound to give results. 13-12 and 7-6. What better
results could be desired? Only a one-point margin of victory, you ask? Quit kickin’, “a beat’s a beat” as our
friend Doc Mathis laconically remarked.

And put Davidson against Duke before a Homecoming crowd, well, there's something putrid in Peru. “Well suh, Mister Joe suh,”
ole Doc Charlie used to say to Joe McCall, “I jus’ don’t know suh, but if you jus’ keep fightin’
suh, we'll win suh!” And Doc Charlie is right. If Davidson plays heads-up football against Duke Saturday, taking advantage of
the breaks and fighting the entire game, the Blue Devils will go home draggin’ their tails behind them.

Wildkittens to Open Grid Year Friday in Clash With Wofford

Tomorrow afternoon the Wildkittens open their football season by playing the Wofford Freshmen here at Richardson Field. The game is
slated to start at 2:30.

After numerous workouts with the varsity, the boys under Coaches Unger and Laird have been shifted quite a bit in
order to find the strongest backfield and line combinations. With a second team rated as good as the first, the
matter of reserves should not bother the mentors. Although this game will be the first venture for the Freshmen this
year in football, it will by no means be an easy one. Little is known about the Wofford Terriers, but
tradition shows that they always put an outfit on the field that gives a good account of itself. Last year
the Terriers and the Wildkittens came off the gridiron with a 6-6 count, which means that the battle this year
should have some of the fight that would be expected from dogs and cats. In 1929, the Davidson aspirants of
football who are now on the varsity squad fared somewhat better than the boys did in '30. They came home
with the long end of an 18-13 score to their credit.

Some really helpful experience has been gained in the scrimmages that have taken place between the Wildkittens and their smaller
proteges. The defensive side of the game has especially been drilled into the Kittens and a number of times they
have held the varsity for the customary four downs. With four full teams out for practice, one of the hardest
things to be done is to pick the best men for the jobs. It is rumored that there are three
all-state men out for the backfield positions, but no man has his place clinched as yet.

The probable line-up is as follows: Morris and Miller, right ends; Hand and Batte, right tackles; Potter, right guard; Lee
and Van Storey, centers; Brewer and Ben Forte, left guards; Siewers and Smith, left tackles; Morgan and Koenig, left ends;
Mackorel and Hufford, quarterbacks; Wingfield and West, right halves; Hutchins and Bumgarner, left halves; Caton and Dupuy, fullbacks. Sam Bernardo
and June Smathers, two promising young backs, have been on the sick list for the past three weeks but will
be subject to use in this game.

Ye ed is unwilling to predict the result of the game, but your old pal Aesthetic Ed, who bears the
brunt of all miscalculations, predicts a one-touchdown victory for the Wildcats.

Here's something else to think about: State won over Davidson 18-7. Florida beat State 34-0. Carolina and Florida played to
a scoreless tie—all of which makes Carolina how much better than Davidson? Once tangled in this type of figuring, the
statistician might just as well join the Elks and sing the Rosary. But that’s neither here nor there. We'll tear
down Carolina’s bridge when we get to it.

Senior Class Victorious In Inter-Class Football

The inter-class football contest came toA close Wednesday afternoon with the Seniors as winners. The Seniors won three games and
lost one, with the Juniors running them a close second, winning two games and losing one. In last year's contest,
the Juniors were the victors with the percentage of wins that the Seniors had this year. These games have proved
very interesting to the spectators as well as to the players. Although it was only touch football that the men
played, they showed some excellent ability and sportsmanship. The teams this year were under the captaincies of the following men:
Seniors, H. L. Carr; Juniors, D. S. Currie; Sophomores, L. M. Huie; and Freshmen, Oscar Bethea. The final rating for
the year is as follows:

| Team | Won | Lost |
|------------|-----|------|
| Seniors | 3 | 0 |
| Juniors | 2 | 1 |
| Sophomores | 1 | 2 |
| Freshmen | 0 | 3 |

Prof. Robert H. Davidson, '23, is now a professor at Southwestern University, Memphis, Tennessee. Davidson completed his ministerial training at
Louisville Seminary, studied at Oxford for two years, and at Yale Divinity School for one year. Last year, he was
a member of the faculty at Hiram College, Hiram, Ohio.

### Casey Leads Attack Which Scores Three Times for Gobblers

A mighty tide of maroon and gold swept over the gridiron in Blacksburg last Saturday to snatch victory from the
claws of a game but battered Wildcat by running up three touchdowns in the final canto to take the verdict
at 18-6. V. P. I., completely outclassed in the initial half, rose to unexpected heights, and led by the ubiquitous
Al Casey, charged through the Davidson team in the closing period to overcome the 6-0 lead that the Wildcats had
hung so tenaciously to during the first three quarters. Casey's cut-backs and maneuverings completely baffled the tired Davidson men, as
he got away for a 49-yard touchdown dash, and ran back punts in a manner that brought the stands to
their feet time and time again.

In the opening period, Davidson completely mastered the situation, holding the Gobbler yardage to a total loss of twenty-five yards.
The action in this period was rather conservative, but the Red team had the V. P. I. eleven on the
defensive throughout. Don McQueen, Wildcat fullback, led a drive that was finally stopped by a line on the Gobbler two-yard
stripe. But the diminutive Bruce Peabody broke into the limelight, twisting his way for a total of seventeen yards by
crushing the V. P. I. line to shreds, and on three successive plays planted the ball in scoring territory for
the first touchdown of the game. King failed to convert, leaving the score 6-0 in favor of Davidson.

At the beginning of the second half, the Gobblers, with their backs to the wall, started an attack in an
effort to overcome the one-touchdown lead of their smaller foe. With Casey doing most of the ball lugging, they had
the ball in the shadow of the Davidson goal as the whistle sounded the end of the third quarter with
the score still V. P. I. 0, Davidson 6. Starting the fourth period with the ball in Gobbler possession on
the twenty-five yard marker, the Maroon-jerseyed backs tore great gaps in the Wildcat line. With Robinson leading the way, they
made two consecutive first downs to place the oval only eight yards from the Davidson goal, and on the next
two plays, Porterfield went over for the touchdown. Again, the extra point was missed, making the score a deadlock at
six-all.

Less than two minutes later, the redoubtable Casey had scored another V. P. I. touchdown. Hardwick intercepted Pearce’s pass in
midfield. Two plays gained a yard, and then Mr. Casey, behind perfect interference, raced forty-nine yards to score and put
his team in the lead. An attempt at the extra point failed.

Apparently not satisfied with the fireworks they had given the crowd, these eleven Gobblers tallied again before the close of
the contest. Starting on their own forty-eight yard line, the Maroon forwards smashed the Davidson line to bits, and with
splendid interference, Casey led the slashing attack that eventually sent him over the last three yards for a touchdown a
few minutes before the game ended with the Virginia Poly on the long end of an 18-6 score.

This constructive revolution in athletics is largely the work of college-trained engineers — young men personally familiar with the needs
of college and school. They are dedicating the technical experience of the General Electric Test Department to the practical service
of undergraduate athletics — designing and installing floodlighting equipment for virtually every sport — football, baseball, hockey, tennis, and track.

Other college men in the General Electric organization have specialized in street-lighting and floodlighting projects, or in the electrical equipment
of industries and mines or of immense power stations; some are designing and applying electric apparatus to propel ocean liners
and locomotives. All are engaged in the planning, production, or distribution of G-E products and so are performing a work
of national betterment and creating for themselves recognized spheres of personal influence.
