Phiedippides Bound | 53

Degrees of darkness engulf me,
Cascading down upon my face and ears.

Two pools of oil and water stare down at me from the road and
Pull at my feet,

Slowing my resolve.

The wet red clay makes my stride
Uncertain.

The contours of the earth are regular
And lull me into

Submission.

The distance is almost covered,

The end nearly here, when

The pain returns and forces me back,

Making all the until-then ground gained

Useless.

If only it were the pain in my lungs and not my loins that
Defeated

Me. But that became meaningless

Long ago.

I am no longer free to run.

Middle Yellows On Traffic Lights

Middle yellows on traffic lights Moons are liquid limes in the nights
during days are hardly at all. withered raw in morning bloodâ€™s suns.
Rather, circular elbows of paled flesh People-engines passing through praise the fruits
bend--hardly seen--warning human-machines found fresh above in blinding darknesses.
who wait for green hands waving, And cautions are lost lemons
who curse red shoulders blocking. in terrible twilights missed.
