Atias and Flessa lead ’Cats’ record-setting performances

In the past two weeks, the track and field teams have ended one season and turned the page to another. At the SoCon Indoor Championships in the last weekend of February, the teams put a close on an indoor season which serves primarily as a warm-up to the outdoor slate. With tiny and sometimes screwy track lengths, the venues create a much different environment than outdoor settings.

Unlike in years past, though, the sprinters really left the biggest impact at their respective conference meets, as both the men’s and women’s 4x400 relay teams set school records. For the women, Cecie Blair ’08, Karina Nascimento ’08, and Summerlee Walter ’08 combined with Jessica Chasen ’07 to break the old Davidson record by more than two seconds with a time of 4:08.32. Megal Atias ’08, one of the most consistent performers for the Wildcats in the indoor season, also finished fifth in the 1600. Brenna Burns ’08 and Katurri Phillips ’08 closed out the strong first-year effort from the women’s squad. Burns nailed a seventh-place finish in the 3000 with a 10:31.06 time that ranks second all-time at Davidson. Phillips, on the other hand, set the 200 record with a 27.05. All of the first-year performances, combined with Walter’s 400 finish, which is third all-time for Davidson, show that coach Jen Straub had really done an incredible job on the recruiting trail.

The men’s 4x400 team, on the other hand, combines youth with a splash of experience. Paul Wyatt ’05 rejoined the squad after being abroad and teamed up with Dave Ritchie ’07, John Bialas ’07, and Stefan Flessa ’08 to finish tied for third overall with a time of 3:22.52. In the process, the squad beat the old school record by more than four seconds. “We feel extremely happy to finally get the 4x400 team on the podium, but that was the minimum we felt that we should place going into the race,” said Ritchie, who got plenty of press as a star freshman last year. “We’ve had high expectations the whole season, and that won’t change going into outdoor.”

On an even more incredible note, Flessa broke two individual records for Davidson for an oversized indoor track. With his 22.71 in the 200 and 50.46 in the 400, Flessa went home from the weekend with three new school records overall. “Stefan has wasted no time in making a mark on this team,” said Ritchie, who serves as co-captain on the squad. “To break three records as a freshman at one meet is unbelievable, and it’s scary to think that his potential has barely been tapped.”

Ritchie credits much of the sprint success to the two new assistant coaches the team picked up since the loss of the well-respected Pete Loeb. “Luckily, we’ve received two amazing new coaches this year,” he said. “Coach Moss and Coach Brewer are the most knowledgeable coaches I’ve ever met, and they have helped everyone improve immensely in their respective events in a short period of time.”

Starting March 27th, we will be closed on Sundays.Outdoor meet this past weekend at UNC Charlotte, meanwhile, the distance team had its chance to shine a bit more. The slew of 1500 runners all ran well, especially Douglas Noreen '07, whose 3:59.52 put him on the top-10 performers list. “My 1500 this weekend was a personal record by about six seconds (converted), and this early in the season I was pretty surprised,” said Noreen, who has traditionally been an 800 runner. “It was kind of a surprise to have that strong of a race this early in the season, and it gives me a lot to build on.” The switch to the 1500 is a bit surprising since Noreen qualified for the US Junior National Meet last June in the 800, but coach Gary Andrew seems to agree with the change wholeheartedly. “Right now, he’s really a 1500 runner,” said Andrew. “He ran a 3:59.92 and finished 10th, and that’s a really good improvement. It was a breakthrough race for him.” Noreen also noted that the rest of the 1500 runners looked strong at the meet. “I was very impressed by the rest of the runners we had in the 1500. Almost everyone ran a PR, and I think everyone was surprised with how strong we are feeling,” he said, singling out that Andy Kifer '08 and Alex Varner '07 had especially strong races. In field events, Joe Taylor '06 had a javelin PR by over 20 feet from last spring. The women’s discus thrower, Amaka Obidegwu '08, on the other hand, tossed the discus 113-08, putting her on the top-10 Wildcat performer list. Atias, meanwhile, stole the show on the track, as she broke the outdoor 1500 record with her second-place finish in 4:43.52. Her third-place in the 800 in 2:20.00 also earned a top-10 performer honor.

Golf surges to sixth-place finish in shortened tourney

In a field of 18 teams, the Wildcats managed a sixth-place finish at the Bradford Creek Intercollegiate on March 18 and 19 with a two-day total of 581. The contest had been scheduled as a 54-hole event, but because of weather, the tournament was shortened to 36. The highest Davidson finishers were Tim Dillon '06 and Alex Knoll '07, who both shot a two-round total 142 on the par-72 course. Dillon and Knoll tied four other players for seventh overall. On Friday, the opening day of the tournament, the team shot a combined 294 that put Davidson in 10th place overall. Dillon led the team with a round of 70, while Knoll shot a 73 on the first day of play. Dan Koernke '05 (75), Peyton Gallagher '05 (76), and Joe Zimmerman '05 (78) rounded out the scoring for the 'Cats. In what proved to be the final round of the tournament, however, the 'Cats began their push upward, as Knoll fired a team-low 69 and Dillon had another solid round of 72 to lead the charge. Koernke, Gallagher, and Zimmerman all improved upon their first rounds as well, as the three carded rounds of 72, 74, and 77, respectively.

These improvements led to a second-round total of 287. As a result, the 'Cats moved up four spots in the rankings to number six, edging out Kennesaw State, Tennessee State, and Old Dominion by one stroke. The strong finish mirrored the steady improvement the 'Cats have made throughout the season, one which admittedly didn’t start off on the right foot earlier this year. “I think we started off the year slow,” said Knoll, “which was not what we were looking for. Right now, we're definitely on the upswing and playing a lot better and more consistently, so our scores are dropping. It looks like we’re getting in top form at the right time.” The strong play on the second day, said Knoll, “showed that we can go low when we need to.” The 'Cats compete this weekend at the Furman Intercollegiate in Greenville, S.C. Davidson will also host the Southern Conference championships on April 17-19 at River Run Country Club. The course should provide a distinct home-course advantage, as Knoll says, “It definitely gives an advantage to play at home [for the conference tournament]. It’s not so much tee-to-green, but when you’re on the green putting, home course advantage is huge.”
