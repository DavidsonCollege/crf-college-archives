Page Six THE DAVIDSONIAN Thurs., Nov. 21, 1940

125 SALEM GIRLS

CAMPUS CAMERA | WITH THE STAFF | SERIAL | CORNER

Guest Columnist—Bob Finley

In the absence of Shaw Smith, who has been away this week attending conferences in Greensboro, we found noticeable stillness down at the “Y.” Of course, there were still the usual ping pong table and newer pool tables, and there was the coterie of operators and females who were around the place, you know. But the regular stream of fellows going in and out of Shaw's office was not there. We might take this opportunity to cast a few orchids to ole Colin. We believe that Shaw is doing a wonderful piece of work down there, and the mere fact of his being in that office means a great YMCA. So let’s all stay behind him and keep giving him that entire wholehearted support he deserves.

Ralph Clontz, tenderly, gives out this list of lost and found articles with the request that if any of these articles be found, they be turned in at the YMCA:
