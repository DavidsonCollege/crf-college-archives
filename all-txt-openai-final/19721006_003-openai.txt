#### Governance Operation Relies On Dean
By TOM BRUCE

Student conduct at Davidson under the new trustees' scheme of regulations passed in June 1971 is entering Phase II. The
sweeping changes in the channels that handle honor violations and code of responsibility infractions have been effective for one year.
Surprisingly, this first year has not been much of a proving ground.

The main areas of redesign were in the establishment of a Student Conduct Council (SCC) and a restructuring of the
judiciary system. The SCC was given jurisdiction over amendments to the Code of Responsibility. Where once the faculty had a
decisive voice on changes in the code, the new committee represents a democratic membership composed of administration, faculty, and students.
The student court systems were realigned to allow a wider degree of choice to persons accused of violations. Where once
the Honor Court's word was law, the verdicts now come from a new corner.

The office of the Dean of Students has proved crucial until the trustees approved the proposals for campus governance. Previously,
the system consisted of a collection of precedents, guidelines, and arbitrary penalties. A student reported for an honor violation, say
stealing from the Student Store, faced procedures that were surrounded with secrecy and a threatening “lock-step pyramid” that made the
Honor Court value consistency above all else. Honor courts had to enforce penalties that did not "fit the crime" simply
because there were no other penalties available: only outright conviction or outright acquittal.

“The new rules are a success because they give the person accused of an honor violation a measure of choice,”
explained John M. Bevan, Vice President for Academic Affairs. “He can yield to the dean's decision, he can request counseling,
or he can choose a student jury and have a hearing. We have cut red tape and at the same
time provided for a judgment in full context with the situation.

“There are two things about rules. First, if rules run counter to justice, we can change them. Secondly, I don't
believe in having great catalogs of rules to handle every conceivable situation. Rules are only guidelines; they don't reduce the
need for judgment,” said Bevan.

Students questioned on the viability of the governance plan seem, on the whole, apathetic. No one admitted to having read
the 25-page list of regulations distributed by the Committee to all students. Most students echoed the observation of one freshman,
“Why read them unless you have to?” Others said that they were interested in the same issues of governance as
they pertain to greater student power, seats on standing committees, and student voice in the evaluation of academic programs such
as experimental programs and the hiring of faculty members.

The provision that violations could be handled by either the dean or the Hearing Committee seemed to meet with general
campus approval. One junior who asked to be quoted anonymously said that he had asked the dean, a professor, and
the college chaplain to counsel with a friend of his whom he feared was stealing small items from students. He
said that nothing was done and that his friend was ultimately convicted of stealing and suspended for a term. Although
he acknowledged that this took place before the new governance rules took effect, he said that the incident had made
him doubtful of the efficiency of counseling.

The present guidelines call for a review board to review decisions that a convicted student cannot accept. The review board
can modify the verdict and reduce the penalty, if appropriate. The board cannot increase the penalty. The final avenue of
petition is the President of the College who reviews the case solely in the light of the appropriateness of the
penalty in total context.

#### Terry Discusses Structural Advantages Of Governance Systems Modifications
By THOM NICOLL
Asst. Managing Editor

Possibly the key figure in the new governance set-up, Dean of Students Will Terry, said Monday that the new system
is functioning adequately and is definitely an improvement over the old system. Terry approved the introduction of counseling directly into
the governance system, via his office, and pointed out the new program’s structural advantages.

“The old system simply ceased to function. The procedures were extremely complicated, and deciding jurisdiction in a case often created
difficulties. The new procedure, despite the length of the document, is much simpler.”Terry noted that there has been some discomfort
expressed among some of the members of the Hearing Committee who were concerned that students would no longer have a
major role in prosecution. He disclaimed any intent on anyone's part to take away from the students the authority over
student regulations. However, Terry admitted that the five or six who chose to deal with him, as opposed to the
one who chose the courts, indicate a lessened role for students in prosecution "after the fact."

"I have concern that students never feel for any reason that they do not have a stake in the Honor
System. We have to have students, especially the Hearing Committee, to remind students about the Honor Code, and the success
of the Code of Responsibility depends completely on whether or not students choose to act responsibly," Terry said.

Terry also pointed to the necessity of the Hearing Committee in such cases as when a defendant pleads innocent, or
when Terry must disqualify himself because of a previous counselling relationship, or if his office were to get a bad
reputation in dealing out sanctions to charged students. Terry said that he feels he has been able to function in
the dual role of counsellor-disciplinarian "pretty well," not having experienced any serious conflicts between them thus far.

"The purpose of the whole judicial system is primarily a helping function. We're not here to hang people but to
help people. Secondly, we must protect the community against irresponsible people," Terry said.

Terry praised the students involved in the system. "I have always been impressed by the conscientious efforts of the Honor
Court (Hearing Committee) to be completely fair to the student, while remaining cognizant of its responsibilities to the community."

Chairman of the Hearing Committee Dick Clay said Monday that the new governance system “reads beautifully and, on the balance,
works beautifully.” Clay cited such improvements as more emphasis on the defendant's rights and a more orderly process, but he
also questioned aspects of the plan. “My specific criticism is that this plan was written for a counselling dean, such
as we have, rather than an ogre. But what happens if we get an ogre instead?”

“Ran Coble, the student body president when these revisions came up, told me, ‘These provisions were written with Will Perry
specifically in mind as Dean of Students. But what happens when we get a new dean? Do we write a
new system for him?’” Clay asked.

Clay pointed out that the new system places much more power in the dean's hands. “In the past, all cases
went first to the chairman of the Honor Court, who decided whether they should be acted on. Now they go
first to the Dean of Students. This forces Terry to make a lot of subjective judgments,” Clay said.

Although Clay agreed that the counselling aspect of the system is good, he noted that under the old system, counselling
sessions were sometimes prescribed as sanctions by the Honor Court. “This is supposed, theoretically, to be an operation by students
for students. Of course, the dean is not a student. I think we are going to have to wait for
at least a year to see how much of a role the Hearing Committee is going to play. If it
turns out that the dean dismisses too many cases, or if the caseload continues to be so light that it
leaves doubts in minds as to the efficacy of the system, then it will have to be reconsidered,” Clay said.

Clay said that now he has hope for the plan and wants to see it work as it is written.
“If any changes were to be made,” Clay said, “I would advocate keeping everything but the option of choosing the
dean to handle the case. Most of the provisions are excellent. If this option were closed, the committee could decide
whether counselling is needed and whether the dean should handle the case.”

Clay said that governance systems are not sacred and should be readily changed as necessary, and that this one should
be given a chance to prove itself in practice.
