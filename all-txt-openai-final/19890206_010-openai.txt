**Prop 42 is not the answer**

Bruce Newsome

Very rarely do I agree with Georgetown head coach John Thompson about anything. For example, why were Steve Kerr and Rex Chapman not on the Olympic team? And why will Thompson not allow his players to become adults rather than his little kids that need his protection from everything? However, I do agree with him that Proposition 42 should not be adopted.

Under current NCAA rules, no athlete who has less than a 700 SAT score can participate in athletics their freshman year. If they have a 2.0 grade point average coming out of high school though, they can receive an athletic scholarship. If they pass their freshman year, they are eligible to play during their next three years of school.

Under Proposition 42, no athlete with less than a 700 SAT score can receive an athletic scholarship whether they have a 2.0 or not. This athlete would have to pay his own way to school his freshman year. If he passed his classes, he would be eligible for a scholarship his sophomore year and would have three years to play.

Proposition 42 takes away the incentive for those students who do not have a 700 SAT to try and graduate with a 2.0. Since the SAT has been proven to be culturally biased and not to be a true indicator of one’s motivation, the NCAA should not just look at the SAT. If a student has below a 700 but has good grades, then he will probably be able to pass at most schools. Of course, I am not saying he could do the work at Davidson, Duke, Stanford, or any other top school. However, he could do the work at, say, N.C. State or Oklahoma. Motivation is much more important than the results of a test on a Saturday morning.

The NCAA could set up a scale that for each 10 points that you are below 700, you have to have .10 above a 2.0 grade point average. For example, a 6’3" 270-pound guard who has a 660 SAT score could be eligible for a scholarship if he had a 2.4 grade point average. This measure would encourage students to work hard in school and reward those that do. Proposition 42 would bring about even more cheating than there already is.

An alternative to Proposition 42 would be a rule that would not allow a school to accept an athlete with low credentials if the school would not accept a regular applicant with the same credentials. If a school does not take normal students with SAT scores below 850 unless they have a grade point average of at least 2.75, then the school should not accept athletes with scores below 850 and 2.75 either. This would keep athletes from getting into schools that they have no business being at in the first place.

Another alternative is to make all NCAA Division I schools have minimum admission requirements for their athletes. Those athletes who do not meet these requirements could not enroll. Coaches are going to want the players with below a 700, and since a majority of these kids are from the

**No, Prop 42**

Dear Coach Thompson,

A little over two weeks ago, the entire basketball world watched as you walked off the court to protest the new Proposition 42 ruling which would cause freshmen who do not meet the NCAA’s academic requirement to not only sit out their freshman year, but also to lose their first year of financial aid. I will admit, as most critics claim, that the black athlete is hit the hardest by this new ruling. However, I think if you look more closely, you will see that the NCAA is not out to punish the blacks, but rather to finally push some requirements that will gradually reform college athletics as a whole.

So, Coach Thompson, although I honor and respect your intentions, I urge you to sit back and listen to how Prop 42 can benefit athletics as a whole. All else aside, the controversy on the new ruling focuses primarily on blacks. Critics argue that underprivileged young blacks see athletics as their only way out of the slums. The new ruling, they argue, will deprive many of them from getting their only chance to make it in the world. Statistics show that only 51% of the blacks score better than the required 700 on the SAT. But who is to blame for these horrendously low scores? Certainly not the NCAA. Blaming the NCAA would be overly helpful alumni.Poor neighborhoods of the inner-city cannot afford to pay the tuition. However, a member of the University of Oklahoma booster club would be more than happy to pay for the athlete’s freshman tuition in addition to his new Corvette. This would be especially true for those private schools such as S.M.U. that have a high tuition and a history of like blaming Roosevelt for The Depression. That would be blaming the solution for the problem. The black athlete is not necessarily at fault either. The cause is undoubtedly the miserable education received by blacks as compared to whites. Finally, Prop 42 could be the savior to press reform measures to get black education up to par. It will give the black community a reason to pressure for immediate reforms in their schools, so that their athletes will be given a fair chance to fulfill their dreams. In order to accomplish this needed reform, hopefully resulting from Prop 42, fairly, I think the reform should be given two years to emerge, so that the immediate victims of the ruling would be eligible for aid since they are a product of this present inferior educational system.

Until now, many blacks have used athletics as their only way in and out of college. Unfortunately, this seemingly fortuitous incentive usually brings short-lived successes and long-term frustrations. Of the few that make it into the college ranks, only a small portion of those even make an NBA squad. Many of the rest end up like ex-Georgia Tech basketball star Sandy Drummer, who works as a custodian at Ball State University. The complaint of the SAT being culturally biased is a weak argument that is accounted for in the low minimum required score of 700. Freshman Brent Leviner remarked, “I didn’t think you could even get into college with below an 800.” It is true that some questions on the test may be culturally biased against blacks, but even answering all of them incorrectly would not put anyone’s score near 700. Furthermore, the validity of the test is a problem that needs to be addressed to the Educational Testing Service, not the NCAA. The NCAA has submitted Prop 42 as simply another way to make all schools and athletes realize that the classroom holds the key to the gymnasium. So, Coach Thompson, instead of finding fault in the NCAA, let us view Prop 42 as a blessing, or an opportunity, to force improvement in black education and to help create true student athletes. Though the first few years will be the most difficult, the possibility of a nation-wide reform of educational opportunity, especially among blacks, will be an even greater prize.
