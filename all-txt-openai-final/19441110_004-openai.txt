THIS and THAT
(Continued from Page 1)

Jokes began. Such jokes as tearing up beds and stacking the frames at one end of the hall, the mattresses
at the other end, and the bedclothes in any space they could be hidden. I know for a fact that
one boy in the base—like a fool—made his bed up eight different times.

As you all know, the ASTRAPs helped put on, or did put on, a show held at the Davidson High
School for the carnival last Friday night. It seemed as though the show was enjoyed by all; even the ASTRAPs
woke up and paid attention to the program. The hit of the show was Durham; his hypnotism act nearly had
the audience in the aisles. Next time we strongly advise McDonald’s daughter to stay away from any show that has
hypnotism in it.

The ASTRAP swing band is going to play at Queens College for the formal dance that is to be held
there this weekend. It seems as though the boys in the swing band have made or are making quite a
name for themselves as musicians.

While we are on the subject of music, we might add that all applications will gladly be accepted for the
ASTRAP military band if you can meet the following requirements:
- Be able to double-time to meals once in a while;
- Be able to walk extra for being very good boys once in a while;
- And have the characteristics of a camel, for you might have to go without supper once in a while.

Any ASTRAP who can qualify for the above requirements will be gladly accepted by the band and Aloia (better known
as Madame Fifi or Tommy Loon).

“Due to war censorship, there will be no sports column in this issue concerning the ASTRAPs,” said our silent sports
writer. (You may draw your own conclusions about him.)

While scouting around Winthrop a couple of weeks ago, I saw a few boys that must have been from some
unknown unit, or at least they didn't have that worried look of the ASTRAPs. Tell the truth, fellows: Did any
of you really make a hit down there? I guess C. D. Coffey might be able to answer this satisfactorily.

There are only four more weeks left of this term, and at the rate time is passing, we are going
to have to say goodbye to the many friends we have made here at Davidson since our arrival in June.
It is without a doubt that most of the fellows are looking forward to spending Christmas at home with their
folks. Here’s hoping that this will come true.

Well, this is all until next time; so until we meet again, so long.

He would head out around the end. They surely put blockers out there. As for Davidson, that bruising, hard, tough
game was too much for them to take for 60 minutes straight. It was a hard-fought, clean, and a...

RICHARDSON TO SPEAK
(Continued from Page 1)

the University of Berlin. He served as a missionary to China from 1910 to 1928 and was dean of the
theological seminary in Nanking, China. Since 1928 he has been on the faculty at Union. He is a member of
the Phi Beta Kappa and Pi Gamma Mu honorary fraternities. Dr. Richardson is a well-known author of books. For some
years he served as the chairman of the General Assembly's Permanent Committee on Evangelism, and in 1943 was elected moderator
of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States, in which capacity he served until the past
spring. Dr. Richardson has three children, the youngest, Dave, having attended Davidson as a member of the class of '40.
While he is at Davidson, Dr. Richardson will be glad to meet with any groups or with individuals for private
conferences and discussions. These meetings will probably be held in the afternoon, and appointments can be made through George Gunn.
As a preacher, teacher, and writer, Dr. Richardson is well-known throughout the Southern Presbyterian Church, and Davidson is indeed fortunate
in having him to conduct Fall Services.

GUNNING AROUND
(Continued from Page 2)

Our whole conversation had taken no longer than ten minutes, I guess, and I returned to my evening paper and
my radio. It was just as the eleven o'clock news was coming on that I heard a commotion out in
the street, but as I rose and started toward the door, it was flung open and the College Registrar, my
next-door neighbor, blew in. “Roper,” he exclaimed, “come look toward the campus. The old gym is going up in flames
and it’s a hum-dinger of a fire.”
