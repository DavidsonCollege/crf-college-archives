THAT TEAM FOR A BETTER DAVIDSON

Vol. XVII DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N. C., AUGUST 30, 1929 No. 1

DR. WALTER L. LINGLE OF RICHMOND, VA. IS DAVIDSON PRESIDENT

He Was Elected by Board of Trustees Last June and Announced His Acceptance July 1st

DAVIDSON GRADUATE

Has Already Written First Message and Addressed Part of it to Students

Dr. Walter Lee Lingle is the new president of Davidson College. When the majority of the students disbanded for the summer, they had no intimation as to the one who would head their college, following the retirement of Dr. W. J. Martin. Dr. Lingle was elected by the board of trustees, meeting on June 2, and one month later he notified Mr. R. A. Dunn, acting chairman of the board, of his acceptance. The new president of the college has just arrived, and will be here to greet the students on their return. He came here from Richmond, Va., where during the past five years he has been full-time president of the Presbyterian Assembly Training School, and prior to that time was acting president for eight years. During the summer he has been traveling up and down the eastern states, and once into the middle west, to fill engagements at conferences. Dr. Lingle is a graduate of Davidson, and aside from his personal knowledge of the college while he was a student here, he has kept in intimate and direct touch with the institution during the past 27 years, having been a member of the board of trustees since (Continued on page 4)

Alarm Clocks Will Be Constantly Used

Alarm clocks at Davidson College will tingle a few minutes earlier this fall for those students who desire to be served with breakfast, because of a change in the schedule. Those who do not care for the early repast and do not have a first period class can awaken in a leisurely fashion, for the chapel period has been changed from 8:30 a.m. to 10:45 o'clock. The new schedule lists breakfast at 7:55 a.m., and the first class at 8:25, instead of 8:55. Lunch has also been changed from 1:30 o’clock to 12:30, giving the division of four morning classes and three in the afternoon. It was formerly five in the morning and three in the afternoon. R. O. T. C. drills are all scheduled for the last period, while heretofore a number of them were held just before lunch. These changes have been under consideration for several years, but the advocates of them did not succeed in getting them passed until last spring. The Chambers Building was finished and accepted by the architect and the building committee before Dr. Martin retired from the Presidency, July 1st.

Third Orientation Program Planned

For Benefit of Freshmen

Wide Variance of Subjects Will Be Discussed—Attendance is Required

Freshmen generally come to college bewildered. New surroundings and new situations have a tendency to confuse them. Until a few years ago the only manner in which they could orientate themselves was the medium of asking questions, and even then some of the new men hesitated to go forward for fear that they would display ignorance before the upperclassmen. In order that the newcomers might familiarize themselves with the place where they were to live for the next four years, and in order to acquaint them with the traditions and ideals of the campus, and at the same time give them a clear conception of the program of work as a college man, the officials of Davidson inaugurated an orientation program, prepared only for the freshmen to help them feel more at home and enable them to get started in their work more effectively. For two years it has been satisfactorily conducted, and the accruing good and benefits have led the college authorities to make it a permanent fixture of their year’s calendar. The third program has been arranged for Tuesday and Wednesday, September 10th and 11th, and attendance at all of the meetings is required. Participants at the two-day sessions include the leading members of the student body, and prominent members of the faculty and administration, who are well-acquainted with the life of Davidson and are able to properly direct the freshmen. The only outsider who has been asked to speak is Rev. Edgar A. Woods, pastor of the First Presbyterian Church, of Salisbury, who will use the subject, “College Ideals.” All of the sessions will be in the auditorium. The complete program follows:

Tuesday, Sept. 10th
7:20 P. M.

All upperclassmen will be assigned courses on Wednesday, September 11th. Assignment of courses will be in the banquet hall of Chambers building. Freshmen may pay their fees Monday afternoon.When they go to the Treasurer's office to get their room assignments, freshmen as well as upperclassmen may pay their fees Tuesday and Wednesday. Freshmen should be vaccinated for smallpox and inoculated for typhoid fever before they come to Davidson.

No arrangements are made to take care of students before Monday; don’t arrive early and expect to gain access to your room. It won't be open. If any student knows that he will be prevented from returning to Davidson and has not notified the Treasurer, do so immediately. If you don’t, you'll lose $10.00, but the college will lose $200.00. Furthermore, some student might be refused admission, for it will appear as if we were filled up.

Who’s Who at Davidson

For the information of the freshmen, and also for the benefit of the upperclassmen, the following Who’s Who in the Davidson student body is published. It is suggested that this be kept on your desk for reference, for it will probably be of use several times during the year.

NEW DAVIDSON PRESIDENT

Dr. Walter Lee Lingle, formerly president of the Presbyterian Assembly Training School of Richmond, Va., arrived here today to begin his duties as president of Davidson College.

Five New Members of Faculty Will Greet Students When Session Opens

Two Are Substituting and Two Replace Others Who Have Gone Elsewhere

When the Davidson College faculty meets in its first session of the 1929-1930 scholastic year on Monday, September 9th, five new faces will be seen among the forty-odd members of that body, one of the men returning after a year’s leave of absence, two of them substituting for professors who will be studying at other institutions this year, and the remaining two replacing others who have left Davidson.

Prof. Lewis B. Schenck returns as associate professor to occupy the new chair of religious education, after spending the past year at the Yale Divinity School in preparation for this work. He is a graduate of Davidson, did his theological work at Union Theological Seminary, and has studied at Princeton Theological Seminary. Professor Schenck will teach several courses in Bible and one in mathematics.

Prof. Fred L. Blythe and Prof. A. C. Gorr will be away on a leave of absence, the former planning to study in Spain, and the latter at the University of Pennsylvania. W. R. Weaver, Jr., graduate of Davidson last June, will substitute for Professor Blythe and will be assistant professor of Spanish. Mr. Weaver spent the summer at Middlebury College in Vermont. James Truesdale, a bachelor of arts and master of arts, graduate of Duke University, will be assistant professor of Greek and German, substituting for Professor Gorr.

Capt. William L. Blanton, of the United States infantry, has been designated by the government to replace Lieut. R. C. Beckett. Lieut. Beckett has completed four years at Davidson, and will go to Cheyenne, Wyoming from here. Captain Blanton comes to Davidson from Honolulu. J. T. Kerr, graduate of Davidson in the class of 1929, returns as an instructor to replace D. H. Howerton in the department of chemistry.

Improvements Made During The Summer

Immediately after commencement, campus forces were organized to make numerous changes before the opening of the new semester. Most of these improvements are nearing completion. To give you a conception of what has been done, a number of them are listed below:

The new pipe organ was installed during the summer and a new Duo-Art Steinway piano was purchased for the new auditorium.

The grading around the north end and east side of the Chambers Building has required the moving of nearly 4,000 yards of earth, which has been placed on the south side of Chambers in the grove opposite the church and on the golf course.

The steam mains, which were leaking, have been removed from the boiler room to the rear of the Chambers Building, and a new line has been laid to connect the chemistry laboratory with the central heating plant.

The Armory will be used this year in connection with the Physical Education work. This necessitated a number of changes in this building. The R. O. T. C. will be housed in a temporary building, and this building had to be changed to meet the requirements of this department.

A force of carpenters and painters have been going over the President’s home preparatory to its occupancy by Dr. Lingle and his family.

Changes have been made at the laundry (Continued on page 4).
