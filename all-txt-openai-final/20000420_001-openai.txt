### Underclassmen invited to stay through graduation
By Mike ANDERSON
Editor-in-Chief

For underclassmen at Davidson, the final days of the spring semester are typically a jam-packed frenzy of final exams, last-minute
papers, hurried farewells, and hastened packing. Not this year. President Vagt will announce this week that all students—freshmen through seniors—will
be invited to stay on campus in the residence halls through Commencement ceremonies on May 21. Vagt hopes the move
will foster a community of camaraderie, as students of all ages can experience just a few days together without the
specter of exams or papers on the horizon.

“We always emphasize the bonds of friendship that can be forged between students here,” he explains, “and this will only
make it easier for people to come together.”

“I think it’s a great idea,” says senior Maurici Sauma. “I think it will be great to be able to
share my final few days at Davidson with my friends in all classes.”

A major motivation behind this move was the opportunity for underclassmen to see their senior friends walk across the stage.
“It will be great to allow students to watch their friends graduate,” says Dean of Students Tom Shandley.

But to some, the proposition of 1600 students frolicking about campus—fresh off of final exams and without any shred of
homework to subdue the revelry—is a somewhat unsettling one. “We're excited to try it, and we really hope it works,”
says a cautious Kurt Holmes, Director of Residence Life. “But we do share in the president’s concerns that it would
only take a handful of people to make that weekend pretty rough on everybody.”

“This is the first year it’s been done,” says Sauma, who works for Holmes as a Head Resident Adviser in
the area around Belk Residence Hall, “so there is a lot of preparation going on in RLO. We’re having extra
meetings, because it could be kind of hectic.”

### Davidson awaits new Campus Center
By Mike ANDERSON

Fifteen years in the making, the Knobloch Campus Center—a building that promises to revolutionize and revitalize student and community life
at Davidson College—is just a few short months away. The five-floor, 66,016 square-foot edifice will emerge from the shadow of
Johnston Gym, transforming the all-but-abandoned gymnasium building into a dynamic, spectacular hub of student life for generations to come.

“The architect has told us from day one,” says Dean of Students Tom Shandley, “that this building is going to
transform the campus in ways that we can’t imagine.”

“I frankly think it will be one of the very best unions on a small campus in the country,” agrees
William Brown, Director of Student Activities. “I think we'll be very proud of it.”

An “open” ambiance. Students and administrators alike couldn’t help but notice that the 1st floor of the Library often rivals
the current Grey Student Union Building as a gathering place on weekday nights. But they hope that the Knobloch Center
will change that.

“The current union could be hopping, but there isn’t a sense that there’s anything going on because the locations are
so isolated. That’s why the library is such a social gathering place, because kids want to hang out with others,”
says Brown. “The new building is exciting: finally a post office, a first-rate food service, great public space, lots of
windows—it will be the place to see and be seen, to find people. There’s so much connectivity.”

Shandley concurs. “Davidson has always placed high priority on community, and we’ve done a...Good job despite the dispersed layout of
locations. Bringing these activities together under one roof will only enhance that feature of community.

The theme of connectedness runs deep in the blueprint of this building. Primarily, it is designed to attract many components
and facets of community life—including students, professors, activities, service, athletics, and the arts. The campus post office boxes promise to
unite students with faculty and staff daily. “The all-campus post office could be the one big thing that makes the
building work,” says Brown. “People can find each other at the P.O. and will stick around to talk because they
can also get a cup of coffee and sit down. It’s a place where students and faculty can interact with
comfortable informality.”

On another level, the building itself promises to connect various flavors of commotion. The open-air architecture will allow students to
walk in the front door and experience activity from all corners of the building. “You can walk into the current
building and there could be 300 people in the 900 Room but no one would know it from the lobby,”
says Union Board President Kirk Willingham. “In the new building, you walk in and you'll be able to see and
hear where people are. It will be much livelier and much more open.”

Group cooperation. The new facility promises to foster inevitable cooperation between campus organizations. Groups ranging from the Union Board to
the Student Government Association.

That weekend, Campus Safety officials, too, are cognizant of the potential problems that might come with such a policy. “Students
won’t have anything else to occupy their time, so there will surely be an increase in activity,” says Marlon Lynch,
Assistant Public Safety Director. Lynch said that he expects to see an increase in patrols that weekend. “Whenever there is
an increase in activity we want to be proactive rather than reactive.”

One man who was visiting campus on Monday chimed in, “Sixteen hundred students on this campus for a weekend with
no work to do? That sounds like the makings of a revolution.”

In efforts to counter any potential disturbances, the college has vested Residence Life and Campus Safety officials with broad power
to manage unruly students. According to a memo from the president’s office, “...in the unlikely event of violations, the usual
customs which direct our actions here will be augmented by the Campus Public Safety Officers and Residence Life Professional Staff
having the authority to direct an underclass student to leave the campus immediately. I am sorry to inject a negative
tone, but I do not wish there to be any lack of clarity on this point.”

Despite the escalated concerns, most all involved expect the weekend to be a positive experience. “It is our hope that
this will be the beginning of a program which affords the opportunity for all who so desire to remain and
share the Commencement ceremonies,” writes Vagt. “It’s a wonderful time to be on a college campus,” Dean Holmes says. “The
pressures are gone and you have a chance to enjoy each other’s company. Students miss too many of the great
things around here because they have to be worried about meeting so many obligations.”
