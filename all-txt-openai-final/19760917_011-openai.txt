First full-time woman coach joins Davidson athletic staff

By MARK SCANDLING
Staff Writer

Davidson College hired Susan Roberts to be its first full-time, exclusively women’s athletic coach over several hundred other applicants this
summer.

Miss Roberts is young, and her coaching experience is limited. However, she played field hockey and basketball during her four
years at Ohio University, and last year she was an assistant basketball coach at the University of Arizona.

She has a working knowledge of the sports she will coach.

Field hockey, the newest sport on campus, will be her main concern this fall, and Roberts has been surprised by
the participation and interest that has been shown thus far.

“I’m excited about coaching, and the girls are excited about playing,” she said. Whether there will be enough excitement to
attract spectators remains to be seen, yet Roberts expects many people to come see the games out of curiosity.

Basketball will occupy Roberts’ time during the winter months. Preparation for the season has already begun, as the Wildkittens have
been introduced to the weightlifting room by their new coach.

Roberts knows little about the other schools in this area, but she hopes to restore the girls’ basketball team to
its winning ways of 1973-4 and 74-5.

Scholarships are a controversial subject in women’s and men’s sports circles today. Some of the women players have indicated that
they favor a scholarship program for women’s sports at Davidson. Others enjoy participating under the present system. Roberts favors running
a program without scholarships, yet she predicts that scholarships are to be a necessary evil if Davidson is to continue
competing at the present level. ‘A big-time program’ is not her goal, however. She still wants a program where anyone
can play, but where some money would be available to aid a top-quality player.

Roberts realizes that scholarships are not a present reality, that they remain in the future. She is willing and eager
to work and coach under the present system.

Roberts says she is glad to be here, and thus far it appears that the girls are glad to have
her here.

‘Cat football team debuts Saturday

By GEORGE STROBEL
Staff Writer

Davidson College football season opens Saturday as the Wildcats take on Colgate College at 2:00 in Richardson Stadium.

Coach Edward Farrell expects Colgate to be the ’Cats’ toughest opposition this year, as the team comes to Davidson after
downing the University of Connecticut 13-7 last week.

The Wildcats have 19 returning lettermen this year—11 on defense and eight on offense. Besides these players, several promising freshmen
have joined the squad.

The defense is expected to be the backbone of the team this year, according to Farrell. Unfortunately, two defensive linemen,
Frank Fields at defensive tackle and Mike Sheridan at nose guard will not be able to start Saturday.

The offense, after a year of experience together, should prove more powerful, according to Farrell. Bob McCarthy will start at
quarterback, and the fullback position has three top men, Page Walley, Terrill Rhye, and Keith Hertzog.

Farrell expects to fill the halfback position with freshmen.

After Saturday’s game, the Wildcats will take on Bucknell College at 2:00 here in Richardson Stadium.
