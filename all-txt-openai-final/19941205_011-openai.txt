Dale Kennington exhibit focuses on everyday realism

By Jonathan Brooks

A waiter arranges napkins on a table while the soft, late afternoon light filters through a window. Quiet reflections of
everyday life such as this one constitute the works of Dale Kennington’s show Time and Place. The Wiregrass Museum of
Art organized the art show, which is currently at the Visual Arts Center.

Although Kennington focuses on everyday occurrences, she chooses moments which are personal so that the viewer can more readily identify
with the imagery. Sam W. Kates, Director of the Wiregrass Museum of Art, has “frequently observed young and old alike
pausing for longer than average time to contemplate and reflect on the imagery.”

One painting depicts a group of average people smoking cigarettes and drinking beer at a cafe. Another work shows a
pianist playing at a lounge with such subtle details as a teetering dollar bill on the rim of his tip
jar. The works typically deal with peaceful moments in a bar, in a dining room, or on a terrace. Kennington
avoids active, highly charged moments; instead, she opts for subtle moments before or after an event is about to take
place. She portrays the moment before a dinner or at a dock after a paddle in a canoe.

The subtle realism that is evident in Kennington’s subject matter is also communicated in her style. The artist employs a
near photo-realism, although she does not create the highly polished surface typical of photo-realistic artworks. Kennington instead chooses a rougher
brush stroke that is appropriate for the impressionistic, momentary glimpse of a quiet setting. Kennington demonstrates a masterful command of
light in her work. The paintings create an overall mood when they are shown together, each capturing the light of
early morning or late afternoon or the warm, quiet light of a lounge. Her ability to depict light is evident
in the play of light on metallic bar stools, a polished piano, or a collection of glasses. Time and Place
will be at Davidson College in the Edward M. Smith Gallery in the Visual Arts Center until December 22.

Charlotte nightlife has a lot to offer

Bar tab continued from pg. 10

FRIDAY — You don’t have to wait until 10:30 or 11:00 to get your weekend started. Go to City Fair
and catch Live at Five. It’s a party to officially kick off each weekend. Charlotte is trying to revitalize its
downtown area, so recently, they added City Fair. A bar with a huge variety of frozen drinks, Fat Tuesdays at
City Fair is not to be missed. City Fair also has a virtual reality game for five dollars, and Mardi
Gras, which houses a food court with a section where local bands perform. After that, head over to the Frozen
Dawg. This place is definitely the bar of choice for Davidson grads. It has pool tables and a huge bar.
It can get a bit crowded, but I guarantee you’ll see someone you know.

SATURDAY — Drag out the clothes you wore to the 70s party and disco the night away at Clarence Foster’s,
right next door to Frozen Dawg. The music is great, and everyone is dancing. If you liked the feel of
the neighboring bar, you’ll love this one.

SUNDAY — Wrap up the week with a different sort of entertainment, the polo matches on Providence Road. This is
a unique social event on Sunday afternoon if you want to just sit back and enjoy a beautiful day. Finally,
cap off the week by going to the Cajun Queen for a relaxing evening of jazz and Cajun food.

Well there it is. I could probably come up with another week’s worth because I did not even mention the
Hornets and Checkers games or all of the great restaurants in Dilworth and Elizabeth, but it’s a start. Also, don’t
miss the fabulous light display in McAdenville (just west of Charlotte). It’s guaranteed to get anyone in the holiday spirit!
