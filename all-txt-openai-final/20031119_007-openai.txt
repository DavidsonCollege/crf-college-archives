Crowe relies on tough stares, manly voice in lead role

Director Peter Weir’s “Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World” does something with cannonballs that few, if any,
seafaring adventures have tried before. For the first time in big-budget history, the cannonballs don’t explode when they strike an
opposing ship. After all, they’re just big hunks of metal; why should they explode?

In the same frustratingly truthful way, the movie as a whole never quite explodes. “Master and Commander,” Russell Crowe’s latest
sure-thing epic, grounds itself so faithfully in historical reality that it stops well short of the indulgent, unbelievable extremes of
its swashbuckling predecessors. This accomplishment is easier to admire than it is to enjoy. Painstakingly honest and stoically subdued, “Master
and Commander” plays more like a superbly photographed documentary than an expensive Hollywood moneymaker. The “wows” in the film occur
more for the sake of authenticity than they do for awe.

Adapted from Patrick O’Brian’s series of novels about Napoleonic maritime battlefields, “Master and Commander” depicts British Captain Jack Aubrey’s (Crowe)
pursuit of the French frigate Acheron. Culling its inspiration from 20 novels, it’s no wonder that the movie feels episodic
at times, weighed down by overabundant source material. Aubrey and his crew endure storms, droughts, damages, and amputations while chasing
the Acheron, but none of their obstacles seem linked to one another. Weir sacrifices a stirring dramatic crescendo in favor
of cramming in as much of O’Brian’s literature as possible.

The film opens with an eerily foggy battle that is more beautiful for its grunginess than it is for its
glossiness. Weir occasionally pulls the camera back to a distance so that we can see the cannonballs streaking furiously from
one ship to another, destroying all lives and limbs in their paths. Unfortunately, not much new ground is covered with
each successive action sequence. Weir correctly assumes that one sea battle should not appear drastically different from the next, but
this tactic renders the excitement predictable and redundant. Not since “The Perfect Storm” (another accurately depicted hydro-thriller) has one stylistic
approach received so many identical treatments within the same film.

Weir has deservedly built a reputation for himself as one of the most masterful heartstring puppeteers in Hollywood. Both “Dead
Poets Society” and “The Truman Show” brought audiences of every demographic to tears without being mawkishly manipulative. Thus, it is
a surprise that his “Master and Commander” doesn’t have more of an emotional pull. Most of the crew has the
stuffy inaccessibility of a dry costume drama. They all perform their roles believably and truthfully, but they never stand above
their context as obedient, French-hating Brits. Crowe does a fine job in a role that doesn’t require much more than
steely eyes and an unwavering voice. Only Paul Bettany (“A Beautiful Mind”), appearing here as the ship’s naturalist doctor, carries
emotional stock worth an audience’s investment. His dream of exploring the Galapagos Islands often vies with Aubrey’s efficient hunt for
the Acheron, forcing the doctor to accept that duty often stands in the way of desires.

“Master and Commander” truly springs to life during Bettany’s eventual tour through his beloved islands. When Weir allows the movie
to be shown throughthe actor’s astounded eyes, this sometime routine accomplishment flashes with the greatness it could have achieved with
a bit more heart.

**Show labors under rock star clichés**

In most things, I’d say that I’m a pretty easy-to-please guy. Never get too upset about much. I do, however,
make one exception: when it comes to music, I am an absolute jerk. It’s embarrassing, really. As ridiculous as it
sounds, I sort of think of myself as a guardian of the flame: I have to be cynical about music
because I love it so much. The critical pessimism of people like me is what challenges bands to be different,
creative, ambitious. We may be merciless, but we only do it because we love music so much we have to
give it the honest truth.

So I admit that I didn’t have high hopes when I walked into the 900 Room last Friday night for
the Elevator Action/Kill Hannah show. I remember walking up the stairs and suddenly remembering just how good things can be,
though. I heard those familiar sounds that never wear themselves out: a rasping and dirty guitar, the irrepressible stomp of
a snare drum backbeat, a high-pitched indiscriminate wash of cymbal noise.

What I was hearing was Elevator Action, the opening band. Following in the footsteps of the White Stripes, Black Keys,
Raveonettes, Atari SB, etc., Elevator Action was a guitar-and-drums duo (oh what dark times for bass players!) reveling in the
sheer joy of playing loud, sloppy, and ragged rock and roll. I couldn’t tell you how a single song went,
but I was really pleasantly surprised: Elevator Action was real. They’re not successful, probably never will be, but that doesn’t
change the fact that they got everything right: the sound was right, the stage moves were right, and everything worked
so well that the sum was more than its parts. A good band can make you feel giddy with the
power of rock and roll, and that’s what I got from Elevator Action. They were second on the bill, but
first in my heart.

I wish I could speak so highly of Kill Hannah. Where I found Elevator Action powerful and exciting, Kill Hannah
was predictable and really somewhat silly. They had these fluorescent lights on their guitars that looked like desk lamps glued
to the side of the guitar. Their stage moves (jumps, grimaces, the singer reaching up to the sky during a
highly “emotional” moment) were all formulaic and contrived. And worst of all, a direct quotation from the lead singer: “Yeah,
Davidson College is real nice...they put us up down at the Best Western in four nice rooms...you know what that
means though...that’s right, four parties later tonight...cause that’s how we roll.” I don’t feel like I should have to explain
how ridiculous he sounded. The whole show was one self-important rock star cliché after another, and the whole thing tried
so hard to hit you over the head with its “authenticity” that it completely missed the forest for the trees.
The sound was pretty weak, too: three guitars = obnoxious wash of angst.

All complaints aside, many kudos to the Concert Committee for taking a chance on a band like Kill Hannah knowing
full well that your average Davidson student might not care too much for them. For what it’s worth, I’d rather
hear 10,000 sloppy garage bands than hear any more acoustic guitars or bongos. Give me rock or give me death.
