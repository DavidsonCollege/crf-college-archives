**BACK THE TEAM**

Football at Davidson during this season of the year holds an important place in the life of the college. A little later other athletic interests will come in to share this place, and practically every man will have an opportunity to take part in some form of athletics. It is unfortunate that every man is not physically able or has not the time to take a central place in one or more of these athletic activities. However, we should not allow the fact that we are not ourselves on the field to keep us from standing squarely behind our teams, and just at this time, this refers more especially to the football team.

These men are working hard, under difficulties, to get into shape for a heavy schedule, the first game of which is almost here. They are asking nothing from us except our full support, and it is our place to give it—not half-heartedly and lukewarmly—as a critic and a pessimist, but with a full conviction that we know we have men representing us who will live up to the Davidson reputation of fighting all the time—to the very last second, giving all they have for the college, and whether they win or lose, that we can gladly say that we are proud of what they have done.

All of us have a feeling of pride when our team trots out onto the field, and even the most cold-blooded man cannot keep the chills from chasing up and down his spinal column when the first whistle blows in the beginning of a hard game. We yell and fully enjoy ourselves when the ball is going our way—at the Carolina game and at Charlotte when Wake Forest is trying to cross our goal, but how about all those weeks before when we should be showing some of this selfsame spirit and thus helping the team to get in shape for those very games which we enjoy so much, when every minute of preparation counts in the final result.

Ours can be a selfish viewpoint—of enjoying ourselves and giving no help, but on the other hand, we can show that “pep” now at the beginning of the season, with signs of encouragement to the team and wholehearted support of them. A good rousing “pep meeting” before every big game should always be a part of the program, and he is a traitor to the cause who does not lend his encouragement to this sign of appreciation and confidence in our team.

Let us remember that when our team walks out onto the field next Saturday at Lexington, just as at every other game this year, that they represent the students of Davidson College—the best we have—and it is our place and our privilege to back the team.

**THE DAVIDSONIAN PLAN**

During the short period of a year and two months since the establishment of The Davidsonian, we have received the support of the student body to a remarkable degree. This applies not only to the subscription list, which has been gratifyingly large, but to the help in all the work of the paper. We all know that there are some details which have to be looked after regularly or we will have no paper. But do we all realize that we need the support of every student?in giving news and in time for writing assignments which are being sent out all the time. The staff is only a very small nucleus of men who are counted upon for certain work and who have shown that they can do this work faithfully and efficiently. The main part of the paper comes from the great majority of students who do not happen at this time to be officially a part of the staff. We would offer as a suggestion that each man interested give his name to some member of the staff and this name will go at once to the assignment editor. Then in addition, each student should keep in mind some one connected with the paper and turn over to him promptly any news that may come up. It may be alumni news, campus items, or some interesting town item, or possibly the material for a leading article. But whatever it may be, we want all the news, and must depend on the students to give it. If it comes in written up in good shape, it will be the more gladly received. Co-operate with us in making THE Davidsonian a paper which can be surpassed by none and at the same time receive a guaranteed benefit for yourself.

MAGAZINE TO APPEAR SOON.

The first issue of the College Magazine will be out about the 15th of October, and will be much larger than the previous issues in view of the fact that there are to be only four issues during the year. The editor-in-chief, F. H. Smith, and the manager, J. G. Patton, are now at work preparing the first issue, with the help of the staff. Anyone who wishes to write articles for this Magazine can get full information by applying to either of these men or to a member of the staff.

LITERARY SOCIETIES.
