4 The DAVIDSONIAN, May 8, 1918

DAVIDSON WINS FROM WOFFORD BY SCORE 4 TO 2

Captain Hengeveld, pitching his last game of college baseball, twirled a beautiful game against Wofford Tuesday. Up to the ninth, only two hits, one of the doubtful variety, were made off the big “Wildcat” twirler. In the ninth, however, he eased up slightly and three hits coupled with a wild throw by Sutton, netted the visitors two runs.

The game started with a rush, when Henry Spann, first man up, drove Purdy’s second offering to deep left-center for a home run. However, Purdy tightened up and although he was hit freely, good fielding on the part of the Wofford team kept down the score. Davidson scored again in the fourth. Hengeveld singled, was sacrificed to second by Sutton’s neat bunt and scored on Richards’ smashing single to right. Davidson’s third marker was the result of singles by Sutton and Burns, in the sixth. In the seventh, “Yank” Boswell secured his second hit of the day and scored on Spann's single.

The fielding of the Davidson team was unusually fast. Two brilliant double-plays broke up promising Wofford rallies. The fielding of “Yank” Boswell at short was without an error and his batting was hard and timely. Ratchford also put up a pretty fielding game. Hengeveld, Spann, and Boswell featured in the hitting department. For Wofford, Rivers caught a pretty game and drove out a nice hit. Vaughan played stellar ball at first.

REVIEW OF 1917-18 ATHLETICS.

With the State track meet at Chapel Hill, which the Davidson “Speed Artists” won rather easily, Davidson closed her athletic calendar for the present year. In every branch of athletics, Davidson has more than held her own this year. Despite the fact that so many of our men failed to return, Coach Fetzer, aided by the few hard-working Varsity men who were left, has turned out teams that have demanded attention throughout eastern as well as southern athletic circles.

FOOTBALL.

The football season was highly satisfactory to all. The Wildcats won six out of ten games, and in the four defeats they suffered, the opponents had to give all they had to win. The Washington Star says in regard to the Davidson-Navy game, which was our first encounter: “Coach Dobie’s big, powerful linemen and fast, aggressive backs failed to measure up to our expectations when they hit up against that scrappy bunch from North Carolina.” True, the Navy won; but it was no walkover.

The A. & E. game was the big disappointment of the year. The official score was given out as 7-3 against us BUT—well, the less said about the game, the better. We'll take it as our part and say nothing.

In a fight that was a typical “lightweight” versus “heavyweight” battle, Georgia Tech’s big team was held to a 32-10 score. That Tech was given a sure enough scare, is no dream. At the end of the first half, Heisman’s Golden Tornado was leading by the small margin of three points. Superior weight finally told on our lighter line, however, and Tech scored 24 points in the last half. They beat our bunch by their “hammer and tongs” drive, but they couldn't break our spirit, and Davidson's battered line scrapped them for every inch. Grey, King, and Flowers were hailed as all-Southern material because of their playing in this game.

The V. P. I. game was lost by a costly fumble in the last two minutes of play. Up to this time Davidson was leading 6-7. Beginning with the V. M. I. game, the Presbyterians rolled up six straight wins. V. M. I., Furman, Auburn, Wake Forest, Wofford, and Clemson were all met and beaten by the “Wildcats.” The Auburn team was counted as Georgia Tech’s chief contender for the championship. They looked big enough, and with Ducote, declared by some as the South's greatest football player, they seemed dangerous. The Presbyterians, however, dazed the heavy Plainsmen with their flying end runs and forward passes to the extent of 21-7.

It would be a hard matter to choose any particular stars from the team. Every man gave all he had to the team, and that is all anyone could do. King, Flowers, and Grey are all-Southern choices, which fact describes their ability sufficiently. Shaw and Elliot at tackles are two of the best tackles.In these parts, McMaster and Richardson held up their side of the line and were splendid running mates for Grey and King. Billy Crouch, playing his first year with the Varsity, was a peerless center. The backfield was beautifully balanced. Flowers, George Crouch, and McAlister were there on end runs and receiving forward passes, while Burns' line smashing was a sight worth taking a journey to see. Henry Spann’s ability to general the team as well as his forward passing stamped him as one of the best quarterbacks in the South. Shaw, King, Grey, Richardson, and George Crouch are lost by graduation. We are losing some of our best. It will be a loss—a heavy loss—but they have given us their best efforts for the four years they have been with us, and we appreciate this fact. New stars will develop as these old ones drop out, and these men are taking their places in Davidson’s Hall of Fame along with Klutz, Booe, Richardson, and Graham. The team that beat Auburn and played the Navy and Tech to a standstill will not be forgotten in a season.

During the long period of time that elapsed between the Virginia and Carolina trips, we played with Guilford in the new Davidson gym. The game, which was unusually rough, was won easily by the “Wildcats” by a 37-24 score. With a team that was in poor condition due to injuries and a long period of idleness, the “Wildcats” made their Carolina trip. In a slow and uninteresting game, Guilford won over them by a score of 22-16. Then a flash of early season form revived, and Elon was defeated 29-23. In two games characterized by fast playing and the hard luck of the Davidson team, Carolina and Trinity beat us by the scores of 28-22 and 30-24 respectively. The final game was played on the home floor with Clemson. The Clemson bunch were completely outclassed and never threatened to take the lead. The final score was 37 to 22 in Davidson’s favor. Hengeveld and King have played their last games. They have starred every year they have played on the team and are two of the best basketball players that have ever worn the Red and Black jerseys. Hengeveld retires with a “D” and three stars, and King with a “D” and two stars. The position of left forward and running mate of George King was divided between Flowers, W. M. Hall, and Davenport. “Dutch,” of course, played his old center position throughout the year. McAlister and McAskill took care of the guard positions. McAlister, who starred in every game by his bang-up guarding as well as his fast floor work, has been chosen to captain the team next year. With three “D” men and several “DC” men to build from, the “Wildcats” should produce a splendid team next season.

BASKETBALL
24—Davidson at Durham vs. Trinity
When we returned only two Varsity men, Davidson's chances in basketball were conceded to be slim. Ex-Captain Hengeveld and Captain King were the men around whom it was necessary to build a winning team. The fact that three positions were to be filled is probably the secret of the winning team of this year. None, with the exception of King and Hengeveld, were sure of a position even up to the last games. Each man had to fight hard to make his job. As all preliminary games were canceled, the Presbyterians were forced to start on their hardest trip, the trip through the Valley of Virginia, with an untried team. The Virginia trip resulted in victories over Washington and Lee, V. P. I., Roanoke College, and Winston Y. M. C. A. The only defeat was suffered at the hands of V. M. I. on the tiny Y. M. C. A. court in Roanoke. The “Wildcats” were unable to get in any of the teamwork that won the other games for them, because of the small court, and Marshall’s and Leach’s long-distance shooting—which was almost comparable to the Germans’ long-range bombardment of Paris. This was the feature for V. M. I. The only game that was played during the long period of time that elapsed between the Virginia and Carolina trips was with Guilford in the new Davidson gym. The game, which was unusually rough, was won easily by the “Wildcats” by a 37-24 score.

BASEBALL.
The past baseball season was lighter than usual, due to cancellations and rained out games. Not a North Carolina college was played except Lenoir. The only games that were not canceled earlier in the season with North Carolina colleges were A. & E. and Elon. Both of these were rained out. The first game, which was little more than a practice affair, was with the team of Company E, Seventh Infantry, Camp Greene. This resulted in a defeat for the Wildcats by a 7-1 score. Then the Southern trip started with Lenoir College on April 1. This game was won rather handily by the score of 5-1. Clarke, making his debut, pitched splendidly for Davidson. The University of South Carolina was played on the next two days. The “Gamecocks” won the first 2-1 and the “Wildcats” the second 5-3, Hengeveld and Currie pitching. The University of Georgia was next defeated easily, and the doubleheader with Georgia Tech was divided. An easy victory was won over Oglethorpe, and Wofford beat the Presbyterians in a poor exhibition, 8-1.
