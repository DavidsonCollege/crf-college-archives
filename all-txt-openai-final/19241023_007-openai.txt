THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER 23, 1924

By special permission from the Board of Trustees, they were allowed to wear gowns throughout the year.

Prof. E. J. Erwin was president of the Phi Society in 1906.

In 1896, Dr. Martin fitted up a handsome laboratory for his class in Senior Chemistry in two private rooms on the first floor of the south wing of old Chambers. There were so many Fresh on the hill in the fall of 1902, that there was a panic in the salt market. Chambers Building was threatened with fire in April 1897. Some venturesome Freshmen, while searching for a skeleton which was said to inhabit one of the large columns in front of the building, dropped a burning paper into the northwest column. Some rubbish, collected in the pillar, caught fire and smoldered for several days, filling the halls with smoke before the position of the conflagration was located.

Davidson has not always had concrete walks! News items from the Davidson College Magazine for December 1898: "The recent snow accompanied by a heavy rainfall has brought Davidson mud to its usual standard of excellence."

The Davidson Monthly was first published Feb 7, 1886, by the Philanthropic and Eumenean Literary Societies. The price was $1.50 in advance.

The first organized golf club in the State was organized at Davidson in the fall of 1896.

On November 23, 1902, the Senior Class appeared at Church wearing caps and gowns. By special permission from the Board of Trustees, they were allowed to wear them throughout the year.

The piano in Shearer Hall was purchased by the college in 1906. At that time, it was the subject of many admiring comments, both in regard to its tone and its beauty.

Immediately preceding the installation ceremony, the retiring president, H. B. Price, made a short talk thanking all the members for their co-operation and urging that they give it fully to the incoming officers. Upon being installed, R. W. Oeland, new president, made a talk on "Increasing Our Powers in Order to Succeed and Serve." He also urged greater interest in the programs and asked that everyone take it upon himself to see that attendance was as near 100 percent as possible.
