D-Purr online magazine lands on its feet
By JENNIFER GAMBRELL
Staff Writer

A recent addition to Davidson College’s publications, the online magazine D-Purr bridges the literary gap between The Davidsonian and Libertas.
The brainchild of Matt Hayes ’08, D-Purr was conceived in the spring of 2007. When Hayes shared his idea with
classmate Erin Doyle ’08, the two eagerly composed a proposal to the Student Activities Committee to get the magazine officially
approved. It took only a few months for D-Purr to reach its online status in early November 2007.

Readers may wonder how the name D-Purr originated. The original name for the magazine was “Descricted,” but, in the middle
of the planning process, Doyle suggested something a little more Davidson-centric. The editors chose a “D” for Davidson and then
added the “Purr” in honor of our beloved Wildcat. With an amusing slogan - “What makes you purr?” the editors
knew they had fashioned a winning concept. Pronounced “deeper,” the name of the publication reflects the goals of the editors
- to delve creatively into the heart of campus issues.

Hayes, Doyle, and Owen Bussey, the co-editors-in-chief, want D-Purr to serve as an outlet for student writers to share their
creativity and passions. The writers may choose their topics as long as they remain considerate of their audience.

Currently, the magazine has six staff writers who rotate writing articles. “We definitely encourage anyone and everyone to submit articles,”
Doyle said. In order to keep readers interested in the journal, D-Purr’s website receives daily updates. The page itself is
a sight to behold. Bussey serves as the page’s main designer, and Hayes creates the site’s graphics and artwork. Type
www.dpurr.com into the internet search bar, and a webpage full of vibrant action greets you. A running artwork slideshow featuring
the week’s articles appears, and there are links to previously published works. Since the articles are self-assigned, there is no
telling what subject you might come across. For example, Natty Hutchinson ’09 wrote about network TV pilots last Wednesday, and
David Dennis ‘08 reviewed Jay-Z’s top-selling albums. Film reviews, cultural criticisms, and opinion pieces also make appearances. If a writer
meets the dreaded writer's block, the editors happily hold a brainstorming session to help generate fresh ideas.

D-Purr has opened a venue for student expression. It is a publication meant to reach out to the masses. Without
a specific target audience, and with ever-changing articles on a variety of topics, the reader is sure to find something
of interest. D-Purr’s editors hope that the pervasiveness of our online culture will add to the popularity of their publication.
They encourage students to read their peers’ writing.

to truly get the crush going, somewhere. When the opportunity arises, remind yourself how wonderful you are and go make
some small talk.

First conversations can be very simple and, please, don’t be overeager. Have some self-respect; don’t throw yourself at your crush.
Instead, plant the seed of interest, and walk away. Mysterious, intriguing, and most definitely SEXY. I would not suggest bringing
up the delicious fried steak in the Commons line if he/she is standing in front of you. A good conversation
opener is natural and something that you would actually be interested in talking about. If that certain someone is in
one of your classes, mention something about the last relationship, asking someone out, and surviving the actual dating. So, ASK.
