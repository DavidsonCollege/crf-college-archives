Spanish Club Initiates
McKnight, Hollingsworth, Falls, Glenn, Powell, Ferran, Geer, Ormsbee, and Herriott Are Initiates

At the meeting of the Spanish Club Tuesday, the following men were initiated: Geer, B. O., Ferran, H., McKnight, J. P., Glenn, R. A., Powell, Wm., Herriott, Geo., Falls, R. A., Ormsbee, J. G., and Hollingsworth. This is the second initiation that the club has had this term, and the men were chosen for their ability as Spanish students, and for the marked progress they have made in their class work. It is the purpose of the club to have, sometime in the near future, a motion picture presented in the gymnasium, either a travelogue of some Spanish-American country, or a one or two reel picture of Spanish life drama. This will be made free to the student body to foster interest in this romance language.

Davidson College Has Unsurpassed Facilities for Military Training
Davidson Has Ideal Drill Grounds and Rifle Courses
IS WELL EQUIPPED
National Guard Officers Witnessed Combat Problems

Of the 40 R. O. T. C. units in the Fourth Corps Area, there are few if any with facilities for military training that equal those at Davidson. Besides ample drill area for close order drill, and a modern rifle range conveniently located, the R. O. T. C. unit at Davidson has easy access to the finest sort of combat maneuver terrain. The golf course and the terrain along Concord road afford ample space for platoon, company, and battalion combat problems. Last year after an afternoon’s practice march, the Davidson unit launched into a series of combat problems. Every Wednesday afternoon there were four problems, one for each company, going on at the same time. While one company was having a problem in outpost at the end of Academy Avenue, another company was having a problem in organization of the ground for a company in defense across from the golf course. At the same time, the other two companies were having problems in advance guard and company attack along Concord road. In these latter problems, blank ammunition was...used. About 30 National Guard officers from North and South Carolina visited Davidson in order to witness these problems. A high-ranking officer in the North Carolina Guard pronounced the work done in the company in attack as comparable to that given at the Fort Benning Infantry School, where he had made a close study of the latest methods of infantry in the attack. The Davidson College armory, which was remodeled last summer, is centrally located on the campus. It affords ample space downstairs for rifles and other government equipment, while the upstairs is divided into four classrooms which are used only by the Military department of the college. These classrooms are equipped with a sand table, relief map, and landscape targets. From a military point of view, they are the best on the campus.

Many Officers Are Leaders On Campus

Each year since the founding of the R.O.T.C. unit at Davidson, it has been officered by cadet officers chosen from among Davidson’s most prominent juniors and seniors. During the past four years, three student body presidents have been among this number, two of them being commanders of “B” Company. Among the ranks of Advanced Course students are found from one-third to one-half of the members of Omicron Delta Kappa, Davidson's highest-ranking honorary fraternity, recognizing all-round campus leadership. Membership in this body is indeed enhanced by high rank in the Cadet Corps. Among the Phi Beta Kappa men also are found a full share of cadet officers. For the past two years, Davidson’s two most outstanding all-round athletes have been numbered among those in the Advanced Course of the R.O.T.C. The Court of Control and the Glee Club during the past school year have been headed by two cadet captains. In every phase of college life, the students taking the R.O.T.C. course have shown themselves leaders, in athletics, in scholarship, in music, in debating, and in countless other ways this is attested.

The man who advised us not to count our chickens before they hatched was just telling us in a polite way that we don’t know our eggs.
