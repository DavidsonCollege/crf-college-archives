ACL injury sidelines Copland for good

Senior forward will undergo surgery over break, miss season

Press RELEASE
Davidson S.I.D.

Senior Kelly Copland will miss the remainder of the women’s basketball season with a knee injury.

Copland, one of the team’s three co-captains for the season, suffered a tear of the anterior cruciate ligament and a partial tear of the meniscus in her left knee during the first half of Davidson’s season opener against Army.

She is scheduled to undergo surgery in her home state of California after exams conclude next week.

“This is obviously a tough loss for us,” said Davidson head coach Annette Watts. “Kelly was just beginning to get into full swing. She was our leading scorer and rebounder in our exhibition game.

“She will continue to be a part of this team while fulfilling her role as captain.”

Copland, a native of Alamo, Calif., played in all 28 games last season including starts in 25 contests.

She averaged 9.5 points and a team-best 6.0 rebounds during her junior season and was going to be looked upon during her final season to be a big contributor to the team’s success.

Davidson is currently 3-3 on the season overall and 1-0 in Southern Conference action after an exciting 65-64 win over College of Charleston on Nov. 27.

The Wildcats return to action Thursday, Dec. 6 at Halton Arena as they take on the Charlotte 49ers at 7 p.m.
