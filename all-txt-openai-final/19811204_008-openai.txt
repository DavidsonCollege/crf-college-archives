**Oriental Art**

**Copeland House exhibits Marson Collection.**

Copeland House Gallery will hold an exhibition and sale of Original Oriental Art this Saturday from 10 am to 5 pm. Marson Ltd. is presenting the collection.

Of the approximately 600 pieces, 200 are newly acquired by the company, which arranges exhibitions in museums, colleges, and universities throughout the United States.

The works have been collected from Japan, China, India, Tibet, and Thailand. The oldest works date from the 18th and 19th centuries and include Japanese woodcuts, Indian miniature paintings, and manuscripts by master artists such as Hiroshige, Kuniyoshi, and Kunisada. The majority of the Chinese works are paintings, and most of the Japanese are prints.

The modern pieces consist largely of woodcuts, etchings, lithographs, serigraphs, and mezzotints by world-renowned Japanese printmakers including:

- **Saito (b. 1907)**, who is considered the father of modern Japanese printmaking because he was the first to forsake traditional images for more modern subject matter. He is very popular in America and Europe. Since he has not produced anything in years, however, his work is becoming scarce.

- **Azechi (b. 1902)**, who has been one of the more popular artists of the past years’ shows and is known for his woodblock prints of bucolic mountain scenes and for his books on the Japanese mountain peoples’ way of life.

- **Mori (b. 1898)**, who is known for primitive, stylized stencil prints of Kabuki actors, ornate celebrations, and peasants at work.

- **Katsuda (b. 1914)**, who began work in the 1960s and is known for a unique process of silkscreening that lends an impressionistic, dreamy texture to his prints of birds, owls, and ancient Japanese architecture.

The pieces will be displayed with open portfolios in an informal atmosphere. Some pieces are quite expensive; others are affordable even on an exiguous collegian budget.

**Controversy**

Produced, arranged, composed, and performed by Prince

One of the brightest stars in the new music scene is a young androgyne named Prince. His music displays a thorough knowledge of both rock and soul, sounding at times like some sex-crazed Id from George Clinton’s darker recesses. In his newest album, “Controversy,” Prince fuses funk and New Wave in a rather tasty concoction which is sure to stimulate both your mind and your feet.

“Controversy” is a fitting title for Prince’s music in general, and for this album in particular: It often seems that he is trying to see how much sexual innuendo he can sneak past the radio censors, and with such past hits as “Soft and Wet,” “I Wanna Be Your Lover” (which is the only Top 40 hit from his previous album), and “Head,” he has already pushed the envelope. In “Controversy,” Prince branches out from the topic of sex to include politics and religion.

This emphasis on current events in modern American society is an important advance for Prince, and can be seen in the New Wave-dipped song entitled “Ronnie Talk to Russia,” which urgently pleads for the President not to blow up the world. In “Sexuality,” he declares, “Mothers don’t let your children watch television before they know how to read/ Or else all they’ll know how to do is cuss and fight and breed.” When these more overt messages are presented in the tight funk of the dance tunes, they receive emphasis through their incongruity.

The music on the album is superb: funk-rock, similar to that on Prince’s last LP. All songs are written and performed by Prince, whose total control endows the selections with a cohesiveness and a steady groove matched by few. Prince’s guitar work on this album is very progressive (especially for a “soul” act), particularly the Hendrix-like solos. His bass playing is gut-level and his keyboard work is reminiscent of Fred Frith or Robert Fripp. This complete artistic control makes for one of the most intriguing dance bands around. Prince, unlike Nick Lowe, writes Pop which is anything but pure, but his risqué funk is most assuredly for Now People. Do your feet a favor, and be sure to check this album out, whether you are an aficionado of soul, rock, or New Wave.
