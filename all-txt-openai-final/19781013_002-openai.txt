"He has shown unlimited patience with his detractors, who have been harsh and that I haven’t had an opportunity to have my say," said Physical Plant Director Grover Meetze. "I think that he’s not active enough with the students on campus. I don’t think he’s very personal," said one junior girl.

There are other views, of course, many others. But perhaps a quicker way to learn about Spencer’s personality would be to look at a few biographical facts. The son of a South Carolina banker, Spencer is 59 years old—husband to one woman and father to four children. In an age which often considers going to church more a sign of hypocrisy than goodness, Spencer still manages to find his way to a pew most Sunday mornings. He is the author of two books, *Decision for War 1917* and *Booker T. Washington and the Negro’s Place in American Life*, neither of which has made him famous.

He graduated from Davidson himself in 1940, after serving as Managing Editor of *The Davidsonian* and President of the Student Body. Like a lot of other people, he fought in World War II; unlike a lot of other people, he not only got out alive but went on to get a Ph.D. degree from Harvard. He was President of Mary Baldwin, the Presbyterian women’s college in Staunton, Virginia, for about 10 years before coming to Davidson.

He claims to be a very private man; abhors having flattering newspaper stories come out about him; and confided to a Charlotte Observer reporter about two years ago that he never did quite figure out what he wanted to do with his life. And, whatever his detractors might say to the contrary, he is also an extraordinarily successful Davidson College President, with one decade of work to prove it.

"From traveling around, I know he is held in high regard at other liberal arts colleges like Davidson. Key people look upon him as a very successful college president," said Chemistry Department Chairman Nicholas Burnett. "He’s got a record that will stand up under scrutiny," Burnett added.

Soon after Spencer took office in 1968, he set up five committees to study some of the college’s lingering problems. Saying "I come to Davidson not as its chief defender but as its chief critic," Spencer set up a Commission on Co-education. "Let us once and for all take it out of the realm of vague speculation and get the facts necessary for a decision as to its desirability and feasibility," Spencer charged the members. Four years later, in 1972, Davidson formally became a co-educational college. Just a few months after the move, *The Davidson Update* began bragging that...A lot more students were applying to come to Davidson. The total number of students was upped from approximately 1000 to 1300 to incorporate the newfound women; few complained. He set up a Commission on Social Patterns, asking, "How can the college best fulfill its responsibility to offer constructive social outlets and opportunities on an equal basis to all its students? What is the place of fraternities in such a program, and a genuinely critical study cannot begin with the automatic assumption that they must have a place."

A few years later, the self-selection system was set up, almost everyone complained, and some fraternities even left Patterson Court. Today, Sig Eps still talk with bitterness about the way Spencer is said to have handled the matter. But however the matter was handled, today there seems to be a quiet consensus that the move was a good one. Certainly, it is a kinder one.

He set up a Commission on Church Relationships, saying, "We used to think of church relations in terms of rules, regulations about church attendance. Students today are far more interested in the essence of the Christian faith as a cure for individual social ills. We want to find out how to gear the church relationship to that level," said Spencer.

Colored with anti-semitism, the story reached as far as the front page of the Washington Post. Spencer denied that prejudice had anything to do with the decision, citing insubordination instead. Nevertheless, the pressure resulting from the protest forced the Board of Trustees to scrap Davidson’s controversial tenure requirement—all tenured professors no longer needed to be Christian. (Some say it still helps.)

In the spring of 1976, a number of students and professors boycotted Davidson’s Spring Convocation in protest of Spencer’s decision to rescind a job offer to a Jewish professor. Whatever the committee decided, and whatever changes were made, it was from this area that the major crises of Spencer’s first decade arose.

When first asked to comment on Spencer’s achievements and failures, the philosophy professor who had a large part in engineering the protest said, “Sure, I’m not chicken.” But then Dr. Earl MacCormac, often mentioned as the administration’s most outspoken critic on campus, missed two appointments he had scheduled to talk about Spencer.

Davidson’s Christian Commitment is still a sore spot of controversy. In 1968, Spencer also set up a Commission on Extra-Campus Responsibilities, saying southern colleges “have been incredibly myopic in viewing the specific needs of a region plagued for a century by problems of racial discrimination, economic deprivation, and cultural malnutrition.”

On October 12, 1968, exactly 10 years ago today, Spencer announced in the Charlotte Observer that he would try to (see Spencer, page 3).
