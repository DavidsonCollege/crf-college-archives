There’s an old proverb that says: "If a man sits in one place long enough, all the sights of the
world will pass in front of him." That may not be quite true at Davidson, but if you chose to
sit in the 900 Room all this week, or at least to go to every event held there during the
week, you would find enough entertainment to keep you from studying for a while. Here’s a sample:

As a replacement for Allen Gwynn, who couldn’t come on Friday, the 900 Room will be the site of a
"Laugh-In," as William Brown terms it, with Bugs Bunny, Little Rascals, and Charlie Chaplin movies starting at 10 pm.

On Saturday, David Niblock and Allen Gwynn will be performing. This duo was one of the favorites last year—their mellow
guitar and vocal sound will relax you after the basketball game.

For those of you who have never been to a Wednesday Open Luncheon, this week’s promises to be extra-special. Along
with the yogurt, chef's salad, and tea ($1.00), the luncheon will feature speaker Doug Marlette, cartoonist for the Charlotte Observer.

Thursday the choices are varied, and the events start at 4 pm, with Joseph Beatty. Dr. Beatty is a professor
of Philosophy at Williams College, and will speak on "Because It Is Mine?: A Critique of Egoism." At 7:30 pm
Dr. Prem Lata Sharma, Davidson’s guest professor of Indian music, will speak and perform on "Music in Hinduism." The music
changes at 10 as a disco ends the day.

All you need is your ID. Check out the 900 Room sometime this week.

Saturday.

**Have a 'Crafty' Christmas**

If you were around during last year’s crafts show, you will remember the wide variety of Davidson students and local
craftsmen who brought their works in to exhibit.

This year’s show will hopefully offer an even greater assortment of crafts. Local artisans will exhibit pottery, weaving, woodwork, and
other special items. One unfortunate problem with the show is that there are fewer Davidson students exhibiting than last year.
If you have a craft/hobby and would like to participate, the show will begin in the Morrison Room at 10
am. If there are many participants, it will continue throughout the day.
