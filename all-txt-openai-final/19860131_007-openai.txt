**Lady Cats go 1-1 for week**

By EDWIN PAGE

The women’s basketball team won their first home game of the season by beating Ferrum 93-88 in Johnston Gym Saturday.
Their 93-point total was the highest amassed by the Lady Cats this season and it couldn't have come at a
better time.

Junior forward Heather McKee put the Cats up 2-0 with the first of her 14 first-half points. Davidson took a
lead that would last the entire first half at 8-6. Despite having significant trouble breaking the press, Davidson held on.
They led by up to nine points on three occasions. What made this performance notable is that the team’s leading
scorer, freshman Lavetta Dawkins, sat out over 10 minutes of the half with an ankle injury. She left the game
with the score 19-16, Davidson, with 13:31 to play in the half, and when she returned at 3:32, the margin
was the same at 38-35. Davidson finished the half strong, pulling away from Ferrum and going to the locker room
with a 48-40 advantage.

The second half started out much as the first had ended, as the Cats continued to hang on to their
lead, stretching it at one point to 12 points. But as the game wound down, Davidson’s difficulties against the Ferrum
full-court press and pressure defense began to tell. Slowly but surely, Ferrum cut into the Wildcat lead until finally, with
less than two minutes to play, they held an 86-85 lead. Where only a few minutes before, it had seemed
that Davidson might walk off with an easy victory, now it appeared that they would let it slide away. But
that was not the case. Dawkins hit a layup to give the Cats a one-point lead, and after a Ferrum
basket, she connected on two free throws that put the Cats ahead to stay. Two more baskets from McKee iced
the game and made the final score: Davidson 93, Ferrum 88.

It was a fine offensive showing by the Cats, who placed three players over 20 points (Dawkins 26, McKee 24,
and junior Jen Artman with 21). Two other players, senior Amy Hartman and junior Harmann, had 10 each. Dawkins also
collected 13 rebounds and McKee had nine.

On Monday, however, the Cats were brought back down to earth in rather rude fashion, 87-57, by a big and
talented Furman team. As if the size differential were not enough, Davidson was hampered by the flu that we have
all become so familiar with, as Heather McKee was forced to miss the game. The referees were less than helpful,
as they allowed lots of banging to go on under the boards. Armed with superior height and a license to
kill, the Furman big people took their toll on Davidson.

For a while, however, it appeared that the Cats might be able to overcome all the adversity as they played
tenacious basketball throughout the first half. Sophomore Beth Elder, seeing significant action due to McKee’s injury, played solid defense inside,
and freshman guard Sara Whitesides turned in her finest all-around performance to date as Davidson hung tough. At half, Davidson
was only down 36-28. However, that was as close as they would get as the Cats neglected to score for
the first five minutes of the second stanza and allowed the Paladins to run away and hide. Furman absolutely denied
the Cats any opportunity to get the ball inside, so it was left to Artman to carry the load from
the outside. Seemingly on another plane, she fired in 17 of the Cats’ 29 second-half points on long bombs that
scarcely touched the net as they fell through. She finished with 27 to lead the Cats, but it was not
enough to overcome Furman.Overcome Davidson's early dry spell as Furman cruised. Despite the strong inside defense of the Paladins, Dawkins
managed to score 11 and Whitesides chipped in nine to the Cat cause.

On a cold and windy night, the action was hot in Johnston Gym as Davidson tangled with the Furman Paladins.
It was a close game until the very end as the Cats defeated the Paladins 67-58 to break a three-game
losing streak and run their record to 11-7 overall and 4-3 in the conference.

Junior guard Chris Heineman keyed the victory by scoring a career-high 25 points. His previous high game was 16 points
against Notre Dame last year. Heineman, generally a role player and defensive specialist, is not known for scoring a lot
of points. But the Paladins, who played a tight 1-2-2 zone defense most of the game, left Heineman open for
the 20-foot jumper. He took advantage of the free space and buried seven of 11 shots from long range while
hitting 11 of his 15 shots overall.

In the first half, Heineman scored 12 points to keep the game close as neither team was able to gain
a definite advantage. The Cats’ largest advantage of the half was three points at 24-21 when sophomore guard Derek Rucker
hit a jump shot with 3:25 left in the half. Furman quickly nullified the lead on the next possession when
John Castile made a three-point play. The two teams went to the dressing room with the score tied 28-28.

For the better part of the second half, the Cats were able to maintain only a slim lead over the
Paladins. With 13:45 left in the game, the Cats took a 40-36 lead on a crowd-pleasing alley-oop slam dunk by
junior forward Ace Tanner. The Cats maintained this slight advantage until the 5:04 mark. At this point, with the score
53-51, Heineman ran off a string of seven straight points which gave the Cats a 60-54 lead with only a
minute and a half left in the game. During this scoring streak, Heineman made a key tip-in off a rebound,
hit a 20-foot jump shot, and went three of four from the free throw line.

The Cats extended their lead down the stretch to preserve the victory by hitting five of six clutch free throws,
combined with a fast-break slam dunk by sophomore Jeff Himes. Defense also played a major role during the last few
minutes of the game as the Cats disrupted the Furman offense by making several key steals which they converted into
easy points.

For the game, Davidson hit on 54 percent of its field goal attempts as they continued their balanced scoring attack
with four players in double figures. In addition to Heineman, senior forward Gerry Born had 12 points, Himes gathered 11
points, and Tanner added 10 points. Tanner also had game-high totals in rebounds with six, blocked shots with three, and
steals with three.

With the win, Davidson topped its victory total of last year, when it finished 10-20. The Cats also upped their
season record to 8-0 in Johnston Gym. This was the third victory in a row for the Cats over Furman.
The Cats are currently in fourth place in the conference behind Tennessee-Chattanooga, East Tennessee State, and Marshall. They have an
excellent shot at moving up in the standings this weekend when they play home games against VMI on Saturday and
Marshall on Monday.
