Ancient Sport of Barnyard Golf Prevalent on Campus Now

Football has passed! Basketball is over! Wrestling has had its last meet. Only baseball and track remain to amuse the
athletic lovers and surely six-hundred odd students cannot engage in these two sports, popular as they may be. So, as
the writer sees it, there remains only one alternative for the boys, namely, HORSESHOES and marbles. The latter is supposed
to be a relic of our childhood days and a college man scorns childish sports, therefore there remains, HORSESHOES.
