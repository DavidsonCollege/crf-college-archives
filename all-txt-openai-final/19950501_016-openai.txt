**National women’s team kicks Finland around**

The U.S. women’s national team showed once again why it is one of the best teams in the world, completely dominating Finland 6-0 in an exhibition Sunday afternoon at Richardson Field.

**SOCCER**

Five different players scored for the U.S., and Finland added to its humiliation by scoring on themselves. The game was the first ever featuring a world champion at Davidson. "I think we finished our chances much better," head coach Tony DiCicco said. "When you finish your chances, everyone is more confident."

Sunday’s game was the second in a five-game series. The U.S. is in the middle of preparation to defend its world title at the World Championships this summer in Sweden. Friday night in Atlanta, the U.S. topped Finland 2-0. In that game, the U.S. dominated play as well, but had more trouble putting the ball in the net.

One of the stars Sunday for the U.S. was 17-year-old Tiffany Roberts from San Ramon, Calif. The high school senior controlled much of midfield play with her blinding speed and athletic ability. "She’s a star now," DiCicco said. "And she’s just going to continue to get better. She’ll get better technically, and she’ll become more of a scorer."

Roberts admits feeling the pressure of playing for a world title at such a young age. "People have expectations of this team," she said. "I just hope I can fulfill those expectations."

The U.S. is in the midst of its preparation for its title defense, which it first won in 1991 in China. There, Michelle Akers was one of the stars for the women. In fact, she scored the U.S.’s two goals in the final, a 2-1 win over Norway. Since then she has been diagnosed with Epstein Barr syndrome and has been fighting back ever since. Epstein Barr is a virus that causes mononucleosis and is associated with various types of cancer. The disease obviously saps Akers' strength and endurance.

She is well on her way to recovery now and says that she is at about 90% of full strength. "By the time Sweden rolls around," she said, "I’ll be as good as it gets."

On this glorious Sunday afternoon, the U.S. women showed off some of the best soccer in the world. Akers, Mia Hamm, and Kristine Lilly showed why they are some of the best players with fantastic moves and dazzling goals. "Friday, we saw glimpses of what we could do," Akers said. "(Sunday), it was there for the whole 90 minutes."

Lilly opened the scoring in the 25th minute with a sensational goal. Dribbling just outside the 18-yard penalty box on the left side, she faked toward the middle of the field, throwing off the defender. Then, she pulled the ball back and fired a shot off her left foot that beat the Finnish goalie. Paulina Miettinen played a fine game in goal for the Finns, making 12 saves as the U.S. outshot Finland 32-8. But she didn’t get nearly enough help from her defense.

In the 35th minute, Akers helped the U.S. reach the halftime score of 2-0 when she put in a rebound of a Mia Hamm shot from about 10 yards out. In the second half, the wheels fell off for Finland starting with an own goal in the 71st minute. A Finnish player was trying to pass back to her goalie, but ended up putting a nice little shot in the back of the net. Natalie Neaton scored in the 74th minute and Julie Foudy struck in the 77th minute. Hamm finished off the scoring with one of her own in the 86th minute.

**Baseball bounced from tournament**

The baseball team went into the Southern Conference tournament last weekend in Charleston with hopes of a big upset.

**BASEBALL**

After all, the team had reasonable success this season against the class of the conference, including two wins in three games against Georgia Southern, and wins against two ACC teams: Duke and Wake.Forest. But upsets were not to be in this tournament as the Wildcats dropped their first two games and were bounced from the tournament. Two of the team’s brightest stars this season were honored for their achievement. Pitching ace Chris Pollard and offensive leader Gus Quattlebaum were named second team All-Southern Conference. Pollard got one of nine votes for Pitcher of the Year, while coach Dick Cooke received one vote for Coach of the Year.

In the squad’s first game, Thursday afternoon against East Tennessee State, Davidson ran into a tough Jay Hensley on the hill for the Buccaneers and fell 6-2. Pollard went the distance for the Wildcats, allowing 13 hits over the nine innings. Only four of the runs he allowed were earned.

In the first inning, Davidson jumped ahead 1-0 when Jeff Andrews tripled and scored on Brian Penny’s infield hit. Hensley then shut down the Wildcats, retiring 16 of the next 17 batters. The one hitter that did reach got to first on a walk and was promptly caught stealing. Davidson got some of its offense back in the seventh when Leo Dozier, running for Quattlebaum, scored on a wild pitch. Quattlebaum had two hits in the game, as did Brad Edwards. Britton Phelps had a home run for ETSU and Len Hart had three hits and two RBI.

With the loss, the Wildcats fell into the losers' bracket of the tournament and had to play Marshall on Friday. The Thundering Herd rolled over Davidson, taking an 8-5 win and ending the Wildcats' tournament run. Jonathan Coulombe absorbed the loss Friday for the Wildcats. Edwards gave Davidson an early 3-0 lead with a three-run homer in the first inning. After Marshall climbed back into the lead at 4-3, Jeff Coker knocked in two more runs to put Davidson back on top 5-4 in the sixth inning. In the seventh, though, the Thundering Herd scored three runs to climb on top for good. Mike Hagy, Joel Torcolini, and Marshall Henry each had two RBI for Marshall.

Despite the tournament loss, the team’s season isn’t quite over. The Wildcats hit the field again Wednesday afternoon, hosting UNC-Asheville. Thursday, Davidson plays host to Winthrop before traveling to Richmond for a weekend series. The team concludes its season May 9 with a home game against UNCC.

Jordan gives NBA some much-needed excitement

For those of you who didn’t notice, the NBA season started Thursday night.

ACCORDING TO SCHOON

Its official name is the 1995 NBA Playoffs, since the league had its annual ridiculous and pointless regular season, which it keeps since teams like the L.A. Clippers and the Washington Bullets must actually play some games. Of course, there really is only one interesting and compelling story this season, and that is some guy named MJ. He proved once again that he is the Best Player Ever Friday night by absolutely dominating the supposedly-good Charlotte Hornets by exploding for a typical 48-point night. There is no question that the Chicago Bulls went from also-ran to NBA title contender in the same amount of time that it took Jordan to say, “I’m back.” And he’ll probably do it again and again and again until he takes the Bulls to the NBA Finals and an NBA title. And there’s really no way to stop him.

People have talked endlessly about how he, along with Magic Johnson and Larry Bird, helped save the league from impending doom, and that the league was just waiting for another similar star to come along. Which is exactly why everyone got so happy when Shaquille O’Neal came along and dunked a lot. But there’s something decidedly unoriginal about Shaq. Sure he dunks. Sometimes he gets a reverse dunk or a backwards layup. Sometimes he’ll come in with a slightly different hairstyle. But it’s always about the same thing.

And that is the story of the NBA. It gets old, it gets boring, and it gets repetitive. Quickly. That is why some of us make it a point to avoid the NBA during the regular season, except to see how Gheorghe Muresan is doing. The league, led by commissioner David Stern, has made such a point to be on the cutting edge of
