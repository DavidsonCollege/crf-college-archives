James Bond Film Series Offers The Best In Escapism

By CRAIG DETWEILER

Bond. James Bond. The name evokes images of narrow escapes, ridiculous gadgets, and voluptuous females. The films provoke anger and
frustration because of their sexist slant and laughter and excitement because of their entertaining formula. Presenting five Bond films next
week, the Pop Film committee offers an opportunity to examine and enjoy the Bond mystique.

The James Bond film series covers fourteen years, three different Bonds, and various villains within one packed week of showings.
Spanning Bondom from 1963's From Russia With Love to 1977's The Spy Who Loved Me, the series allows one to
distinguish the Bond formula. Each film begins with a horrible plot by a master villain to overthrow and rule the
world. Bad guys like Ernst Stavros Blofeld and Stromberg do not mess around when planning world domination. Working with evil
agencies like SPECTRE, Blofeld and the bad guys try to place the superpowers in opposition so they can gain control
while the USA and the USSR are occupied. James always receives his instructions and debriefing on the threatening situation in
the London offices of Her Majesty’s Secret Service. In each film, Miss Moneypenny, the trusty secretary, sends Bond into the
offices of head honcho, M. While the actors playing Bond change between films, Lois Maxwell and Bernard Lee appear in
each as Moneypenny and M.

The Ian Fleming formula calls for James to travel to an exotic locale (in the five films—Russia, Japan, the Alps,
the Caribbean, and the Atlantic Ocean) and happen across a gorgeous local girl. The females offer themselves to James after
a brief time, and subsequently get overinvolved in the grueling assignment. It doubles the fun and satisfaction when James must
save the world and the girl at the conclusion of each film. Quite a predictable, but exciting formula.

The five films, presented chronologically, allow one to see the three (yes, three) different actors who portrayed 007. Sean Connery
begins the week in From Russia With Love and You Only Live Twice (1967). As the original James Bond, Sean
sets the standard by which all subsequent Bonds are measured. With his rugged Irish looks, hairy chest, and ruddy complexion,
Sean makes a gritty, earthy Bond. He brings a coolness and ease to the role that has not been recaptured.
When Sean makes wry, dry James Bondesque remarks, one laughs at the confidence and assurance of his character. The audience
responds to Sean's Bond because it totally trusts and believes in his control of any situation.

Wednesday night’s selection, On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969), features Australian George Lazenby in the Bond role. Compared to Connery’s
command, Lazenby appears stiff and tense. When Lazenby enters a room full of beautiful women with a kilt on, he
appears self-conscious. Connery would enter cocky. Realizing the loss of Sean, the producers of the Bond series injected an extra
healthy dose of action and beauty into On Her Majesty's Secret Service as compensation. Telly Savalas makes an appealing, mysterious
Blofeld and Diana Rigg offers the most serious love interest ever in James Bond’s life. The bobsled race-chase scene also
provides some additional thrills.

James Bond week concludes with two Roger Moore films, The Man with the Golden Gun (1974) and The Spy Who
Loved Me. Moore improves upon the stilted Lazenby, but lacks the humanity of Sean. In contrast to Connery’s international appeal,
Moore appears distinctly English with his pale skin and prim manner. Hecreates a dapper, dashing Bond who remains unflappable despite
redneck sheriffs, flying cars, and deadly submarines. Executive producer Cubby Broccoli pushed the Moore films in the direction begun with
Lazenby. A more polished, professional, and expensive James Bond film appears. In Golden Gun, two love interests are offered in
Maud Adams and Britt Ekland.

Christopher Lee gets a quirky, devilish sidekick to add to the villainous nature of the film. Herve Villechaize of “Fantasy
Island de plane, de plane” fame, helps Lee squelch Bond. The Bond formula finds a special fulfillment in The Spy
Who Loved Me. A stirring performance of “Nobody Does it Better” by Carly Simon launches the film into an extra
high gear. Death-defying stunts, an especially gorgeous co-star (Barbara Bach), and the all-time greatest Bond challenger (Richard “Jaws” Kiel) propel
Spy into the pantheon of classic Bond flicks.

In the fourteen-year survey, one finds a decline in the appeal and approachability of James Bond. From Sean Connery’s human,
embraceable Bond to Roger Moore's aloof 007, the cinematic 007 becomes more of a fantastic superhero. To cover the loss
of humanity, James Bond’s presenters rely upon increasingly provocative locales, females, and villains. Check out the five fine pop films
next week and decide which Bond, if any, you prefer.
