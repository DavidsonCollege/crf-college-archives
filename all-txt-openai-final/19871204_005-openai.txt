**Faculty discuss human rights on AI panel**

By MARGARET CARROLL

On Wednesday night Amnesty International and the Dean Rusk Program sponsored a panel discussion on human rights in four regions. Dr. Lafayette Diggs, Dr. Grant Jones, Dr. Jack Perry, and Dr. Lakhi Sabaratnam discussed Liberia, Guatemala, Eastern Europe, and Sri Lanka, respectively. After each of the professors spoke, the audience asked questions about the media’s role in the area of human rights and the improvement in the various countries. In beginning the panel discussion, Sabaratnam explained the purpose of Amnesty International, which speaks for the release of prisoners of conscience and hopes to eliminate the torturing of all prisoners.

Diggs began the talk by discussing the limitations upon human rights which exist in Liberia. He explained that much conflict in Africa is a result of African goals to eradicate racial conflict and to correct the imbalance between the rich and the poor. He said that neither goal will ever be realized until peace and stability are also achieved.

Because the two types of government in Africa are military and authoritarian, decisions are always made from the highest level and sent down, Diggs said. Liberians cannot even joke about their leader or a member of their leader’s family, and if they do, they will be beaten and tortured.

In Liberia, human rights violations occur in several forms: disappearances, imprisonment, and torture. “Pumping the tire” and “letting the tree fall” are two common tortures: a prisoner who “pumps the tire” must put his fingers in his ears and do deep knee bends continuously, while a prisoner who “lets the tree fall” must fall onto the ground, face forward, without using any part of his body to stop himself. Liberian prisons are overcrowded and do not provide food or toilet facilities. They are called “horror chambers,” and many never return from them.

Next, Perry spoke on Eastern Europe and explained that the human rights situation is different in every Eastern European country. Albania forbids religion to exist at all; Bulgaria represses its Turkish minority; Czechoslovakia attempts to suppress the Church. In general, however, each of the communist regimes restricts human rights by holding political prisoners and suppressing religion.

The Soviet Union seems to have been improving its human rights record since Gorbachev’s ascension to power, but many still question the freedom of the religious Soviets. Because 1988 will be the thousandth anniversary of the Orthodox Church’s entry into Russia, more attention may soon be focused on the fate of religious believers in the USSR.

Speaking on Guatemala, Jones noted that common forms of human rights abuses are disappearances, open village massacres, and torture. Between 1978 and 1986 over 100,000 Guatemalans have died as a result of non-war violence. From 1956 to 1986 the military regime brought some of the worst violence imaginable to Guatemala as it sought to destroy all opposition.

In each of these countries, the media has not reported human rights abuses for several reasons, the most important one being that it is too dangerous. Each of the professors agreed that Amnesty International makes government leaders aware of world opinion, which must always be one of a leader’s most important concerns.

**AK selects new members**

By MARGARET CARROLL

Davidson’s chapter of Omicron Delta Kappa (ODK) tapped its new members this week. Members chosen this fall are seniors Lauren Brooke Adams, James Edwin Earle, Laura Olivia Fannin, Gaulden Reed Herrero, William Van Dorn Young, Amy Lynne Cheek, and juniors Harry Smoak Bryant, Jr., Ronald Craig Carlock Jr., Molly Maude Cochran, Samuel Thomas Cutting, Julia Sneade McCrory, and Sarah Louise Whitesides.

ODK is a national leadership honor society, founded on the ideals and leadership of George Washington and Robert E. Lee. ODK was founded at Washington and Lee University in 1914, and Davidson’s chapter was founded in 1917. ODK was founded upon “the idea that leadership of exceptional quality and versatility in college should be recognized, that representatives in all phases of college life should cooperate in a worthwhile endeavor, and that outstanding students, faculty, and administration members should meet on a basis of mutual interest, understanding, and helpfulness.”

Members of ODK are chosen as juniors and seniors twice a year, in the fall and spring; and they must be in the upper 35% of their class. Members must also have displayed leadership in one or more of five areas: scholarship; athletics; social, service, and religious activities, and campus government; journalism, speech, and the mass media; and creative and performing arts.

ODK carries out two major projects each year: practice job and graduate school interviews for seniors in January, and the ODK outstanding teacher award each spring.

ODK members are president Andy Bright, Karen Coppedge, Vincent Knight, Sarah Payne, Mike Poulos, Derek Rucker, Gretchen Schoel, Holly Sparks, Todd Wallenius, Eric Whytsell, and Rob Zimmerman.
