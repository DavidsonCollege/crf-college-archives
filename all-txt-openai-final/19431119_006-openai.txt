portrait, whose eyes move vigorously, watching his every movement. (Eyes always played by Boris Karloff). Our hero (whom we shall
call Percival, because that is not his name) chooses the left staircase. As he reaches the top step, another ear-splitting
scream rings out. He turns just in time to see two hairy arms close tightly about the head of a
lovely maiden on the other staircase! Then all goes black—it’s a pre-view.

Main Show

A shaded lamp throws its light over a table about which four men are seated playing at cards. “Whitey,” a
dirty stool pigeon, jaunts into the room, feeling his oats. The four men look up; then look down again. “Duke”
(there's always a guy named Duke) gets up off an orange crate and walks over to a dark corner of
the bare room, ignoring Whitey. (Now Whitey has been down to the corner police station squealing on his friends. Duke
and the boys know that Whitey has been down, and we know that Whitey has been squealing, but Whitey couldn’t
know that).

To continue... Whitey senses the tension in the air. He rushes over to Duke and falls on his knees, pleading
vehemently for his life. Duke stands above him, flipping a coin.

Whitey shrieks, “I didn’t mean nothing, Duke! I didn’t wanna squeal, honest I didn’t. I wanna get out of all
this mess! I’ve got a wife, kids, a little chicken farm. I wanna settle down... .”

Rat-tat-tat-tat.

Duke lets him have it and he settles down. We settled down for the rest of the colossal production.

Alpha, honorary music fraternity, and treasurer of the Philanthropic Literary Society.

Purpose

The purpose of Who’s Who is to create on a national basis recognition for students. The first edition was printed
in 1934. Besides its primary purpose which is the recognition of outstanding college students, it also serves as a source
of recommendation for these students as employees in the business world. This volume of Who’s Who will be released from
the printer next February.

Requisites

According to the editor, “requisites for membership are character, scholarship, and extra-curricular activities, and potentialities for future usefulness to business
and society. Juniors, Seniors, and students in advanced work are eligible.”

“It is our purpose to keep these leading graduates before the manufacturers as the most promising candidates for employment.”

CAGERS BEGIN PRACTICE
(Continued from Page 3)

It is expected that the Southern Conference will be full strength for the basketball season.

With the exception of Duke, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Richmond, the loop will be composed of all-civilian teams, all
eager to prove their worth. The outlook for the Cats is bright.

Coach Shepherd hopes that a large number of boys will report Monday, since he wants to choose the best material
possible.
