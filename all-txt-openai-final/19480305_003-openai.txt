Feature Contest Produces Meager Results:
$25 Prize Offered For Best Story

Two weeks ago THE DAVIDSONIAN announced the opening of a feature contest in which entries could be made by any
student at Davidson. This was done simply for one reason—to give every student an opportunity, by making a personal contribution,
to take part in an effort to make this paper of greater interest to each man in his family, and
his friends. This is to be accomplished by making pertinent suggestions to the Editor, and by taking an active part
in the programs sponsored by the editors of THE DAVIDSONIAN.

This feature contest is such a program. This is your chance to add that personal touch that means the difference
between a DAVIDSONIAN which is looked forward to and read with interest each week and one which is briefly scanned.
We urge you to make the most of it.

THE DAVIDSONIAN is offering a $25.00 cash award for the best feature story submitted. A feature article is an informative
and usually thought-provoking account of a situation, an organization, or an event of human interest. This can be done in
any number of ways. The subject of your feature is left to your own choosing.

The rules of the contest are printed below for the benefit of all interested students who did not have an
opportunity to read them last week.

1. This contest is open to any member of the student body. If student body members wish to submit an
entry, the exception being in the case of the DAVIDSONIAN editorial staff.

2. Articles must be no more than 700 nor less than 500 words.

3. Entries may be either typewritten or written in ink.

4. All entries must be placed in an envelope bearing the full name and box number of the student submitting
the article. The envelope should be addressed as follows:—Davidsonian Feature Contest, Box 305.

5. All entries become the property of THE DAVIDSONIAN.

6. Contest closes at midnight on March 31, 1948.

Final decision will be made by the judges on the basis of literary merit, genuine humor—if of a humorous nature,
and ability to hold the interest of a reader. If space permits, every contribution submitted will be published in THE
DAVIDSONIAN.

(Editor's Note: The following much discussed article appeared in THE DAVIDSONIAN some years ago, according to the rules of this
contest. Let us hope that no more such articles will appear in the future to mar the excellence of The
Davidsonian.)

In the days when the college operated on a work-as-you-go kind-of-system, the original founders of our paper. According to the
rules of this contest, let us hope that no more such articles will appear in the future to mar the
excellence of The Davidsonian.

In those days the bell was manually operated by pulling the rope. Students were sent to the fields to work
until the bell was rung to signal that they could return. Clever students of that bygone age went to extremes
to ensure their early return by having the bell ring early. Perhaps the most effective method of doing this was
tying a pig (I understand that all sorts of animals ran rampant on the campus in those days) to the
bell rope and giving him sufficient corn to keep him standing in one place eating until the students got out
to the fields. Soon after they arrived, however, the pig would finish the corn and start to move around, thus
causing the bell to ring, which, of course, brought the students back to the campus.

The bell clapper has been stolen many times by students. The story is told that the clapper was stolen from
Wake Forest by Davidson students. At any rate, the act was perpetrated, as the bell has not been heard for
several days, much to everyone's inconvenience.

A few facts on our present bell, sans clapper, are interesting. It was given to the school by R. E.
McDowell of Charlotte, to replace the one which melted when Chambers burned. It was cast by the Meneely Bell Co.,
of Troy, N.Y., in 1922, at a cost of $1800. Physically, it may be described as weighing 1500 pounds, looks
like any old bell only larger, and is tuned in the key of “G.” Incidentally, Professor Bailey is rumored to
have said that if the students could prove that a professor took the clapper out of the bell, he would
cancel all cuts taken so far this semester and would give the students an extra day’s holiday over Easter. There
must be someone among the faculty who could be approached in a monetary manner, at least it is worth trying.

Y Receives ‘Letter of Thanks’ For Christmas Gift

A letter was received by Mr. William McLean, secretary of the Y.M.C.A., in appreciation of a gift to the Sendai
Y.M.C.A. by the entire student body.

Dear Mr. McLean,

When I first saw him in the fall of 1945, as building materials become available. As soon as I return
to Japan in April or early May I shall be in touch with the situation there, and will write you
more in detail regarding the developing plans. I did, however, want to get this preliminary word to you with my
personal expression of very sincere thanks and appreciation for your cooperation and for the gift.

With cordial personal best wishes to you, to the cabinet, and to the student body of Davidson College, and looking
forward to an occasional interchange of letters, I remain,

Very sincerely,
WUSSTEELInterest of the “LETTERS TO EDITOR” me about the wonderful gift from the student body of Davidson College. (Continued on
Dave Dw ich) Would there be some of the students there who would be interested in corresponding with some of
the students in Sendai? This kind of personal relationship might be a mutual asset both individually and for the associations
represented.

Regardless of the merit of his serious subject, courtesy demands that we give respectful attention to it. And it should
move us to better conduct, the practical matter of other people’s opinions — should it not?

Sendai is one of the most important cities of northern Japan, located some 200 miles north of Tokyo. The Sendai
Association had made a wonderful start before the war under the able leadership of a young general secretary by the
name of N. Kumagai. Everything was completely wiped out in one of the air raids, many of the laymen scattered,
and Mr. Kumagai was for a time at a loss to know just what to do. The enclosed reprint written
by Mr. Patterson will give you a sense of the situation he faced.

The content of The Davidsonian should indirectly announce a change in long-standing policy by the publication of an article openly
libelous in content.

By RONNY DIETRICK

We all enjoy poking fun at ourselves occasionally, and to cause of frustration to the student body. This was a
case of evasion by causing the bell to ring.

In later years it has been the practice of stealing the clapper out of the bell so that it could
not ring. This has been the practice for many years. The last time the clapper was stolen it was hidden
in the pulpit in the chapel and according to rumor, students had a hilarious time when Dr. Cunningham stood in
chapel with his hands resting on that pulpit and requested the offending students to return the clapper.

Editor, The Davidsonian

Davidson, N.C.

To the Editor:

After the many improvements shown in the feature evening, it is unfortunate that last week’s issue should indirectly announce a
change in long-standing policy by the publication of an article openly libelous in content.

The college bell has always been a cause of frustration to the student body. This was a case of evasion
by causing the bell to ring.

In later years it has been the practice of stealing the clapper out of the bell so that it could
not ring. This has been the practice for many years. The last time the clapper was stolen it was hidden
in the pulpit in the chapel and according to rumor, students had a hilarious time when Dr. Cunningham stood in
chapel with his hands resting on that pulpit and requested the offending students to return the clapper.
