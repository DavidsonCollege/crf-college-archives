Southern Conference Sets Requirements
By MIKE TANTILLO ’85

A proposed amendment to the Southern Conference Constitution would force Davidson to “schedule more Southern Conference games or drop out
of the S.C.,” according to Athletic Director and football coach Ed Farrell. "The amendment requires all conference schools to compete
for the S.C. football championship. Davidson does not compete for the title because it does not play enough conference games.
According to Farrell, dropping out of the S.C. would be “devastating to basketball” because the winner of the S.C. basketball
tournament “automatically receives a bid to the NCAA tournament.” If Davidson goes independent, says Farrell, “we would have a small
chance of qualifying for the tournament,” adding that an “NCAA bid” would give the college “a lot of important exposure.”

Farrell admits that scheduling more S.C. football opponents would mean “trading some strong teams on the schedule for some teams
a little bit stronger.” But he also noted that “a school like Colgate University,” which does not give football scholarships
and has academic standards comparable to Davidson’s, qualified for the Division IAA football playoffs. He concluded that “playing football in
the Southern Conference does not mean we will not be competitive.”

Farrell recommends that “our football team fulfill the requirements in order to stay in the Southern Conference.” Davidson could stay
in the S.C. without giving more scholarships, because the conference only sets scholarship maximums, no minimums.

A proposed piece of legislation at the NCAA level would set attendance requirements for a football team to compete at
the IAA level and a basketball team to compete at the Division I level. Football games must draw 4700 home
attendance per game or basketball must draw 3500 home attendance per game in order for a school to compete at
the Division I level. If, however, a school is part of an athletic conference, only a majority of the schools
in the conference must meet the attendance requirements to allow every college in the conference to stay in Division I.
If this legislation passes, and Davidson were to drop out of the Southern Conference, attendance would not allow either football
or basketball to compete in Division I of the NCAA.

The Southern Conference affiliation also helps sports such as golf, tennis, and wrestling. In these sports, qualification for NCAA tournaments
is on an individual basis. For example, the best second seed in S.C. tennis may go on to a national
tournament.

Faculty Committees to Study Semesters
By RICK AVERY ’86

The Educational Policies Committee (EPC) and the Executive Committee of the Faculty will soon begin deliberations on the projected switch
back to a semester system. The EPC will meet next Monday at 4 p.m. to plan a daily schedule for
a semester system. A sub-committee appointed by College President Samuel Spencer will meet sometime in the next two months to
work on adapting a revised calendar, according to E.C. secretary David Kaylor. The sub-committee consists of: Biology professor Dr. Donald
Kimmel, English professor Dr. Gill Holland, and Vice-president for Academic Affairs and Dean of the Faculty T.C. Price Zimmermann.

The semester system proposal was made by the Semester Planning Committee. The faculty approved a revised proposal on 19 October,
60-33. Also approved was a provision requiring that the proposal not be implemented before the 1984-85 school year. A student
referendum held 12 October, however, showed that 77.2 percent of those students voting were against changing to the semester system.
The turnout was one of the largest ever, according to SGA Vice-president Boe Young, with a total of 962 voters.

The version of the semester proposal now being viewed by the EPC and the EC is an amended version of
the Semester Planning Committee’s original proposal. This amended version keeps the graduation requirement of thirty-six courses, a “normal” teaching load
of six courses per year,Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

and six credits for the Humanities program.

**PIRG Fights Dwindling Membership**

By JIM CROWE ’83

The Davidson chapter of the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) continues to sponsor awareness programs despite dwindling membership, according to
PIRG Chapter President Jenny Barnhardt. Barnhardt, a junior from Mount Airy, North Carolina, is this year’s only remaining active member
of the group from last year.

PIRG began over a decade ago as a national student organization founded by Ralph Nader. The national group seeks to
bring public awareness and research efforts to social, environmental, and consumer issues. In recent years, the Davidson chapter has concentrated
almost exclusively on environmental issues because those in charge of the chapter have shown little interest in consumer issues, Barnhardt
noted. “PIRG here is a very small group, and we basically do issues people in the group are interested in,”
she said.

Earlier this year, the group conducted an awareness program concerning the ocean dumping of nuclear wastes. Barnhardt said the members
researched the topic, then organized a letter-writing session to key U.S. senators in support of an environmental bill prohibiting ocean
dumpings. Action was taken on the bill during the recent lame-duck session of Congress when Cong. Anderson of California slipped
it by as an amendment to the Gas Tax Bill. The amendment created a two-year moratorium on ocean dumping and
requires that both Houses approve all ocean sites after that period.

Barnhardt said that the Davidson PIRG chapter also sent testimony to a public hearing about the Navy’s proposal to dump
decommissioned nuclear submarines in sites off the North Carolina and California coasts.

The Davidson chapter has scheduled several on-campus programs for the coming months. The group will sponsor the film *Lovins on
the Soft Path: An Energy Future with a Future*, at 7 p.m. on January 25. The film by Salvatore Raciti,
shown on PBS’s “Nova,” has won numerous awards from the Audubon Society, World’s Fair, and other groups for its treatment
of the topic of alternate energy sources.

John Hinck, the United States coordinator for the international environment group Greenpeace, will speak on March 10 at 7 p.m.
on activism in environmental issues. The free program in the Morrison Room will also include the showing of a Greenpeace
videotape on ocean dumping.

The Davidson PIRG chapter receives funds from a voluntary contribution system. Students or their parents can include an optional $4.00
contribution on their tuition payment forms. Barnhardt said PIRG received about $700 this year. Alumni and other interested people do
sometimes send in contributions to the chapter also, she said. The money goes towards film rentals, speakers’ expenses, administrative costs,
and partial dues to the national organization. These dues go to support professional staff workers in the Durham and Greensboro
offices of the NC PIRG. The staff provides background research, organizational newsletters, and occasional speakers to the Davidson chapter. Barnhardt
noted, “Since we don’t have enough funding to pay full dues, we don’t expect them [NC PIRG] to plan activities
for us like they do at some other chapters.”

Other North Carolina schools with PIRG chapters include Mars Hill, UNC-Greensboro, UNC-Chapel Hill, Duke, Elon, and Guilford.

**DCF Collects Clothes**

By TIM McGAUGHEY ’85

Davidson Christian Fellowship conducted its annual clothes drive this week. Three DCF small groups sponsored the drive. Small group leaders
Jean Webb, Meg Surratt, Kathy Gratto, Craig Detweiler, and Dick Lee directed the 30 members of their groups in this
effort. Participants put boxes in all eating houses, dorms, and the Commons to hold all donated clothes.

Jean Webb said that the clothes drive is part of the Outreach Program of the fellowship. The collected articles will
be taken to the Crisis Assistance Ministry in Charlotte. From there, the clothes will be distributed to needy citizens in
Mecklenburg County.
