### Trustees approve draft of strategic plan

**Plan calls for enrollment expansion, more interdisciplinary work**  
Brian Moran  
Editor-in-Chief

The Board of Trustees voted last weekend to approve in concept a draft of a strategic plan that outlines broad principles for school policy direction over the next ten years. Among the most notable aspects of the plan is a proposal to expand Davidson’s enrollment to no more than 2,000 degree-seeking students from a current 1,865. Additionally, the plan expresses intent to examine opportunities for expanding the school’s interdisciplinary curriculum and to begin offering credit for depth-learning experiences, including internships.

The Board also approved final operating and capital budgets for the 2009-2010 fiscal year. The operating budget includes a three percent cut in spending and an across-the-board salary freeze. Notably, the capital budget contains a $1.5 million renovation of Cannon Dormitory that is scheduled for this summer.

President Tom Ross and other members of the principal executive staff, a group of top school administrators, developed the strategic plan with consideration of the results of a series of faculty-staff study groups on various issues related to College policy. “The general strategies and objectives that we had recommended were left unchanged by the board,” Ross said. The Board will likely vote on a final version of the strategic plan at their next meeting in October.

### Ever greener

Food and yard wastes that Davidson’s service facilities produce will now be composted to form completely natural fertilizers rich in nutrients. The waste will come primarily from Commons, the Union Café, and other dining services, including Connor Eating House, and the rest of the waste from the yards around campus.

All of this waste will be composted using a newly acquired commercial-grade rotating drum built specifically for composting. Waste spends approximately six days rotating inside the Green Drum at high temperatures. The benefits of using a drum rather than just letting waste decay are that the drum lets oxygen enter, thus making the process faster. Because of the oxygen and moisture and in addition to the mixture of carbon and nitrogen from the waste itself, the composted product will have neither odor nor pests.

In fall of 2007, five study groups examined external issues likely to affect the College, such as globalization and regional change. Seven additional groups looked at internal considerations in spring of 2008. In addition, the school employed consulting firm Center for Applied Research to conduct a survey of Davidson faculty, staff, students, alumni, parents, and trustees.

The strategic plan is the first step in developing long-term policy and, as such, lacks detail regarding the actualization of proposed policies. The principal executive staff will produce implementation and financial plans that address the specifics of these policies and funding sources. In regards to enrollment, for instance, the plan proposes only that the school...Expand the student body to some number less than 2,000, leaving an exact number undetermined. Similarly, the plan says nothing regarding a timeline for the increase or whether it should occur incrementally or all at once. The implementation plan will flesh out the details.

Neuroscience majors presented their theses to students and professors alike at the Carolina Inn Monday afternoon. The presenters included Kathryn Cole ’09, Kim Lang ’09, and Sarah Rhodes ’09. Upcoming presentations in East Asian Studies, Genomics, Public Health, and Religion and Literature will follow later this week.

Davidson takes on large-scale composting

It will be environmentally friendly in every sense. Once the compost matures (three to six months after its original processing in the drum), it can be used to nourish all of the gardens, yards, and flowerbeds around campus. Even the new blueberry patch near Vail Commons will be fertilized with this compost.

The composting project was started by a group of students in Anthropology Professor Fuji Lozada’s food and culture course. As Sustainability Fellow Kealy Devoy explained, these students researched available methods, analyzed their costs and benefits, and talked to experts. President Ross “loved the idea,” Devoy said, so the project soon took off.

One such expert is Bernie Beers, whose company, BW Organics, sold Davidson the Green Drum. What is key for projects like Davidson’s is that we understand that, “this is not waste but unused energy,” Beers said. “People need to become used to that term of ‘unused energy,’” Beers added, so that they can articulate the benefits of organic fertilizer.

Aside from significantly reducing Davidson’s carbon footprint, another benefit of organic fertilizers is that they are more financially sound. When “comparing the costs and benefits of composting versus using conventional fertilizers,” the benefits far outweigh the initial costs, Beers explained. These initial costs include the $40,000 cost of the Green Drum, but after the initial investment, there is not much more spending required. Even the energy needed to keep the drum’s main motor on all day costs only 38 cents per day.

Composting “just makes sense,” Devoy said. “Why put your food waste in a landfill when you can turn it into a high-quality soil amendment? Composting will reduce the number of trash pick-ups that Commons needs. It will reduce the amount of compost we need to buy every year to put on campus. It will reduce the amount of solid waste we send to a landfill, thus reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. Using compost on soil will promote carbon storage in our soil, further reducing greenhouse gas emissions.”

These reasons all stay true to the college’s commitment to environmental sustainability and to becoming a carbon-neutral campus. “Overall, we estimate that composting will prevent 12 metric tons of CO2 from being emitted each year, which is about the same as removing two vehicles from the road for a full year,” Devoy added.

Once this project is fully up and running, Davidson’s goal of reducing food waste by 50 percent will be within reach. The virtuous circle that this composting initiative will kick off will provide the Davidson College community both with fresher and healthier food while reducing our greenhouse gas emissions—both of which the College considers worthy goals.
