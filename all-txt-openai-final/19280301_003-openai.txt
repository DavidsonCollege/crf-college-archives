Lon Chaney Here in “The Big City”

A very entertaining program has been booked for next week by the Davidson Theater with Lon Chaney as the feature
of the week. On Thursday “Tillie’s Punctured Romance” will appear. This picture stars Louise Fazenda, Chester Conklin, and Al Fields.
Another big comedy will be on the following Thursday with the well-known team of Wallace Beery and Raymond Hatton in
“Partners in Crime.” Critics report favorably concerning this film. On Friday and Saturday, Lon Chaney will star in “The Big
City.” In this picture, the famous actor appears without his usual grotesque make-ups and relies entirely on his power as
an actor. “Red Hair” with Clara Bow will be shown on Monday and Eleanor Boardman in “The Crowd” is booked
for Wednesday.

Central and Latin America Discussed

The International Relations Club held its regular weekly meeting on last Thursday evening and the main topic for discussion was
the present Central and Latin American question. Dr. Currie gave a talk of some length from the point of view
of international Nicaragua, with particular reference to the subject for intercollegiate debate. Since the subject for this debate deals with
the protection of American interests in Latin America by force of arms, Dr. Currie’s talk tended along this line. The
meeting was turned over to an open forum with emphasis placed on the above-mentioned question. Dr. J. M. McConnell and
Dr. W. Lingle took leading parts in the discussions. Due to the fact that the condition in Latin America was
to be discussed, the members of Davidson's debating team were asked to be present. In all, there were asked to
be present at the meeting.

Lecture is Too Radical for ‘Liberal’ Wisconsin
President Glenn Frank Asks Student Forum to Cancel Engagement of Lady LecturerWisconsin's boasted liberalism missed fire when the Students’ Forum
cancelled a lecture by Mrs. Bertrand Russell, on the ground that her message was not in keeping with the policies
of the Forum.

First objection was registered by Scott Goodnight, dean of men, when the “Cardinal” published excerpts from the New York newspapers
giving Mrs. Russell’s views on companionate marriage, free love, and eugenics. “The quotations attributed to her,” said Dean Goodnight, “were
unworthy of any speaker who was invited to speak on a university platform.”

He notified President Glenn Frank, who then asked the officers of the Forum to reconsider their action. They decided to
cancel the lecture, but insisted that the action was taken on their own initiative without either coercion or recommendation from
the president. The chairman of the Forum explained that when the lecture was planned, it was believed that Mrs. Russell
had “a valuable and significant” message for the students, but later information leads us to believe that we were wrong.

President Frank would make no statement, but referred an interviewer to his article written for the “Cardinal's” first Sunday magazine,
before the Russell episode. That was entitled “Sane Censorship,” and said in part: “Official oversight of student discussion should, I
think, concern itself, to the virtual exclusion of all other considerations, with the preservation of elementary good taste and common
decency. It should not concern itself with a dogmatic selection of ‘safe and sane’ ideas. For after all, most of
the ideas we now think safe and sane were once derided as unsafe and unsane.”

Dean Goodnight and F. Louise Nardin, dean of women, approved the cancellation. Mrs. Russell did speak in Madison, but not
until E. F. Meyer, columnist on the “Capital Times,” had gone to a great deal of bother finding a hall
that would permit the lecture. Following Dr. Currie’s talk, the meeting...
