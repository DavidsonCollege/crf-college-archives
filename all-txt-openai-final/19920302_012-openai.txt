12 THE DAVIDSONIAN ARTS MONDAY, MARCH 2, 1992

Campus Quote of the Week:

"...one reason I have always loved baseball so much is that it has been not merely 'the great national game', but really a part of the whole weather of our lives, of the thing that is our own, of the whole fabric, the million memories of America. For example, in the memory of almost every one of us, is there anything that can evoke spring--the first fine days of April--better than the sound of the ball smacking into the pocket of the big mitt, the sound of the bat as it hits the horsehide: for me at any rate, and I am being literal and not rhetorical--almost everything I know about spring is in it--the first leaf, the jonquil, the maple tree, the smell of grass upon your hands and knees, the coming into flower of April. And is there anything that can tell more about an American summer than, say, the smell of the wooden bleachers in a small town baseball park, that resinous, sultry and exciting smell of old dry wood."
-Thomas Wolfe
