WOMEN, from page 10

One is that addressing someone as an adult, especially if she is not used to being addressed as an adult,
will give a little nudge to her self-esteem. Admittedly, the self-esteem building will be small, but we can all use
as much of it as we can get. Secondly, treating others with respect is good manners. The Southern politeness of
calling people “Sir” and “Ma’am” has exemplified this quality for years. Treating someone as an adult, not a child, by
the words you use to refer to her is an extension of this principle of good manners. My third reason
is that women too often are treated like children. Most of the time people have no idea that they are
participating in this subtle discrimination. Fortunately, changing the way you use words is a very simple way to refuse to
participate in it.

As an example of this phenomenon, we can look at another group that has been (and in many cases still
is) discriminated against—blacks. “Hey, boy” used to be a form of address that whites could use for any black man,
even if he was thirty-five years old, because it connoted that he was not of the same status as a
white man. Although it is not used with the same malicious intention, “girl” has the same effect. I hope that
you will not only agree with me that women should be called women, but that you will go the necessary
step further and change the words you use. Yes, it sounds funny at first, but most new things seem funny
until you get used to them. After a while it will sound very natural and you will say it without
thinking about it. Then hearing other people say “girls” will start to sound strange. Personally, I cringe every time I
see a sign around campus advertising “Freshmen Girls’ Bible Study” or “Girls’ Lacrosse” although in the past I would have
walked by them without paying the slightest attention to the wording. Now, even though I cringe, it makes me feel
better to know that changes are taking place.
