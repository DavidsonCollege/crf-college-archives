Women’s soccer: It’s finally Plosser’s time to shine

By Wit Bradshaw

Sports Editor

Sometimes there is a different kind of

surviving, which can’t be measured in con-

secutive games played.

Lucia Plosser was an early-
decision applicant, but coach Kevin
Hundley never recruited her for the
women’s soccer team. She spent
most of her first year spot-playing
midfield and marking back, until
she fell victim to mono and sat out
the spring.

“I think her freshman year was
really disappointing for her,”
Hundley said. “She was sick for
eight months, and we didn’t know
what was wrong. She barely played.
It was not a great experience for
her, but she got herself healthy in
the summer and came back a differ-
ent person.”

As Plosser tells it, she had her
tonsils removed in the summer and
then felt great. She wrote Hundley
a letter saying how excited she was
about the upcoming season. Still,
she started her sophomore campaign
as a reserve.

In the third week of the season,
the team traveled to Virginia for a
tournament. Hundley decided to try
Plosser at forward in their matchup

with Harvard. In the second game against
Kentucky, she knocked in a goal, securing a

spot on the all-tournament team.

“She did a great job against Harvard,”

Hundley said. “We gave her the start against
Kentucky, and she scored. I saw we were
better with her in the game, and she started
the rest of the year.”

However, Plosser was thrown another
curve to start her junior season. For the first

game against GSU (Georgia Southern) I
broke my big toe. I had to sit in the confer-
ence tourney (which Davidson won by beat-
ing Furman 3-0 in the title game).

“I think coming in, the coach who rec-

cross the ball in last season’s matchup with Wofford. Rob Kosicki

ommended me said I had potential, but hadn’t
had great coaching. I’ve had to deal with a
lot. Sickness. Benching it even though I’d
been playing well. All that has made me a
better player,” she continued.

And according to her teammates it’s
made her a better captain.

“She takes a lot of responsibility on
herself,” fellow captain Kelly Amman said.
“She’s constantly thinking about the team.

When anybody has a slip and starts
thinking about herself, she brings her
back to team. Being co-captains with
her makes my life easier.”

This year there was no controversy she
would be starting in one of the forward
spots. After leading the team in goals
last season (10) and being ranked in
the region for game-winners (4), it
was clear Plosser would be in the
lineup.

“We won’t make the same mistake

this year,” Hundley said, and he

didn’t. She had her first season-open-
ing start in last week’s thrilling win
over South Carolina. But even that
start was doubtful.

“She was injured for a good part of
the pre-season,” forward Ginny Dye
said. “She worked really hard so she
was able to play in the first game, for
herself and for the team.”

Hundley said she is an example of
“what is good about the women’s
soccer program.” And Plosser doesn’t
mind being an example.

“It’s so big to keep everybody’s
spirits up,” said Plosser. “I think I’m
a good person for the freshmen, even

sophomores, juniors, maybe even the se-
niors to look at. No one’s getting as much
playing time as they’re used to. I’ve showed
through my four years that you can make it.”
