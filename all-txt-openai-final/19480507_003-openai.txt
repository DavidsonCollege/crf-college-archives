Last week we began reviewing this past year’s Wildcat sports slate, but we ran out of space before we got
all around. So we shall continue this week to pass out orchids as they are due.

With only a meet with Mercer in Macon Saturday remaining, Coach Pete Whittle’s track squad has hung up a creditable
season’s record of three wins and two losses. Led by Co-Captains Jack Gray and Jim Vann, the cindermen ran wild
over Furman, W&L, and The Citadel, but bowed to South Carolina and Clemson. Gray has remained unbeaten in both the
mile and two-mile runs in dual competition. Vann was slated for competition in the Florida relays but had to drop
out because of a throat infection. He has picked up more than a few points this year in both the
discus and the shot. Sprintman Ed Newton has surprised all this year in showing plenty of speed to Cat supporters.
Newton has amassed 43 points in five meets which presents an average of more than eight points per meet—not bad
in any league. Ed hasn't received the credit due in our estimation, so we'd like to give him a big
pat on the back for his efforts.

The Wildcat golfers, who probably get less notice than any other of the squads, have turned in an enviable record
of eleven wins, three losses, and one tie. They have bowed only to State, U.N.C., and Rollins College while knotting
with South Carolina. Veterans Freeman Jones and Cam Henderson fire in the number one and two spots, followed by Monty
Hill, Ford Little, Phil Tatem, and Buck Williams in that order.

Rounding out the athletic picture we look at Coach Derrick Barton’s crack tennis squad which has been the most successful.
The racket wielders had pounded out ten straight wins before dropping a heartbreaker to the University of North Carolina for
the state championship. It was the only close one the Cats had seen all year and it had to drop
the wrong way. But the netters bounced back strong and pinned a stinging defeat on Duke’s vaunted Blue Devils. It
was a signal honor for Davidson because it marked the third Davidson victory over a Duke athletic team this year,
while the Durhamites managed to win but one. The Cat basketball and baseball squads had previously turned the trick and
Duke gained its lone win in the semi-finals of the Southern Conference basketball tournament. The squad gained more steam for
its present northern jaunt in rolling over Presbyterian College in its final home appearance. Lone mishap of the occasion was
the sprained ankle of number three man Jerry Robinson. “Wart” has shown great stuff all year and it is a
severe blow to the crusade into Yankeeland. Whit Cobb was also left home which left two spots in the top
six to be filled. It looks like they have been well filled, for as we go to press we have
reports of the 9-0 whitewash which the Cats handed to Richmond’s Spiders Monday. Henry Neisler and John Crosland stepped in
to fill the singles spots well. Crosland teamed with Roddey for doubles and Bill Childs got with Rob Palmer for
a doubles victory. The two Keeslers hold the other duet spot.

Since this is the last edition of the year, we will be unable to cover the remainder of the spring
sports. It’s been mighty easy writing about successful teams and we hope we’ll have the same delightful job next year.

Cat Netmen Victorious

Meeting the Blue Devils in Durham, the Cats, led by Bo Roddey, defeated a strong Duke net aggregation. Roddey easily
defeated Emory Green in straight love sets. Roddey then paired with Durham’s Whit Cobb to hand Duke's John Ross and
Bob Taylor their first loss in doubles of the current season. This pair had been Carolina’s ace doubles champs. The
fortunes of the Cats were severely marred by the ankle injury of one of their stalwarts. Lenoir Keesler defeated McMaster
7-5, 4-6, 7-5 in the hottest match of the day. This match marked the Cats' thirteenth win of the season,
the only loss being to Carolina's racqueteers.

Davidson 6, P. C. 3

The Cats' staunchest rivals in P.C. vanquished the Clinton men by a score of 6-3. Bo Roddey defeated Charlotte’s Bob
Spurrier in straight sets, 6-2, 6-2. The Keesler family was in for a bad day as both brothers lost their
singles, and combined to lose their doubles to Spurrier and Harper, 6-4, 6-4. Neisler-Williams and Bradley-Walburn hooked up in a
sizzling match hampered only by the injury of Robinson, which demoralized the Cats who took every set. Bo Roddey had
no difficulty in downing Cunningham, 6-0, 6-2. Henry Neisler continued his winning ways, while John Crosland won his initial start
as a netter. He defeated Ware 6-1, 6-2. Coach Barton employed the full squad in the doubles and the Palmer,
Neisler-Keesler, and Roddey-Crosland combinations all turned in convincing triumphs.

Davidson 9; G. W. 0

The Cat netters continued their northward invasion with a convincing 9-0 conquest of the G.W. netters. Only one match between
Neisler and Weise went three sets. Weise rallied after losing six straight games to take the second set 8-6, and
forced the third set to a 7-5 final. Bo Roddey kept his victory string unblemished with a 13-14, 6-3, 6-3
win. This marked the final appearance of the ace Cat squad on their home nets.

Davidson 9; Richmond 0

The Cat netters opened their northern tour with a convincing 9-0 triumph over the Richmond Spiders. The loss of Whit
Cobb and Jerry Robinson failed to demoralize the Cats who took every set. Bo Roddey had no difficulty in downing
Cunningham, 6-0, 6-2. Henry Neisler continued his winning ways, while John Crosland won his initial start as a netter. He
defeated Ware 6-1, 6-2. Coach Barton employed the full squad in the doubles and the Palmer, Neisler-Keesler, and Roddey-Crosland combinations
all turned in convincing triumphs.

The Mary Osborne Trio’s latest Decca disc “Funny What a Dime Can Do” dateated.The contest has finally come to an
end with the completion of the softball tournament this past week. Since last week, the standings have shifted just a
little. The final standings are: the Kappa Sigs, first, with ten wins and no losses, and the Betas second, with
nine wins and one loss. Buddy Cheek on the mound, and Bingham at the plate led the Sigmas through their
ten wins while Earl Smith, Bill Lyday, and Cliff Turner were outstanding on Earl Groves’ Beta team. The final softball
standings are:

| Team | W | L | Pct. |
|--------------|---|---|-------|
| Kappa Sigs | 10| 0 | 1.000 |
| Betas | 9| 1 | .900 |
| S.A.E. | 7| 3 | .700 |
| Phi Delts | 6| 4 | .600 |
| S.P.E. | 5| 5 | .500 |
| Pi Kaps | 5| 5 | .500 |
| Phi Gams | 4| 6 | .400 |
| K.A. | 3| 7 | .300 |
| Independents | 3| 7 | .300 |
| Sigma Chi | 1| 9 | .100 |

The final interfraternity standings are not complete, since the number of men who have participated in the college athletic program
has to be considered in the calculation, and that is not complete at this time. However, the final interfrat sports
standings, not including the varsity competition, are as follows:

| Team | Points |
|--------------|--------|
| Kappa Sigs | 686 |
| Phi Gams | 527 |
| Phi Delts | 527 |
| S.A.E. | 500 |
| S.P.E. | 398 |
| Pi Kaps | 381 |
| Independents | 322 |
| Sigma Chi | 308 |
| Pikas | 280 |

John Crosland had no difficulty in downing ex-high school champ Kershenbaum, winning in straight love sets. All three doubles went
two sets with T. Keesler and I. Keesler winning 6-1, 6-1; Roddey-Crosland emerging victorious, 6-1, 6-3; and Williams and Neisler
winning, 6-3, 6-1.

Leland McKeithen reported that with one exception, clubs were functioning on every college campus in Carolina—a mark for all North
State organizations to shoot at!

Cat Track Team Bows To Clemson

Saturday’s meet with Clemson resulted in the Wildcats' second loss of the season, which gives them two losses to three
wins with one meet left. First places were split evenly between the two teams, but Clemson's majority of first and
second places gave them their 77 to 53 points victory. Bursts of hard wind made running rough, but in spite
of it, some good times for the Davidson track team were turned in.

Gray was high scorer of the afternoon with 10 points for wins in both the mile and two mile, clocking
a 4:41.5 in the first and 10:54.5 in the latter. Newton, with firsts in the 100 in 10 seconds and
the 220 in 22.8 seconds, has proved that his 10-second 100 is no accident by repeating it on the home
track. Hopper won the 220-yard low hurdles event in 26 seconds and placed second in the high hurdles, adding to
his record of wins as well as to the Cats’ score. Cobb started a four-way tie for first in the
high jump with three Clemson men at 5 feet 10 inches and placed second in the broad jump. Brownson and
Vann turned in usual firsts in the javelin and discus. Brownson took the javelin with a throw of 153 feet
11 inches while Vann hurled the discus 142 feet 1 inch.

On Saturday, the Cats close against Mercer in Macon, Ga., and here’s hoping they make their expected four wins for
the season. We would like to end on a note of congratulations to “Pete” Whittle and the track team for
helping to make the Davidson '47-'48 athletic year more successful than it has been in the past few years.

Davidson Swamps Furman Nine

Dick Marlowe turned in one of his most outstanding victories of the season and his teammates hit well to hand
Furman an 11-0 defeat in the baseball team’s last home appearance. Marlowe threw a three-hit shutout at the Purple Hurricane
and Davidson's fence busters came through with 13 base knocks that featured three home runs. Auburn Lambeth teed off into
deep right-center in the first inning for a home run that also scored Charlie Pearson. Dave Poole also hit one
in the same general vicinity and Hal Mapes drove in a run and scored himself on a single that was
errored and turned into a homer. Mapes was the big man with a bat for the Wildcats with 3 for
4 and scoring runs.

The box score:

| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9
| R |
|----------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Furman | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0
| 0 |
| Davidson | 2 | 2 | 0 | 4 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | x
