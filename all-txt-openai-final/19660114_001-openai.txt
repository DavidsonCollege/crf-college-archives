Registrar Squelches Draft Scare Rumors

There is no immediate need for concern over the draft scare circulating among Davidson students lately, Registrar F. W. Hengeveld told THE DAVIDSONIAN this week. Hengeveld stated that all the rumors are speculation and that there have been no changes in the draft laws as yet.

The interest in the draft has been stimulated by articles in newspapers and magazines suggesting that students may be drafted out of college in the near future. In the Jan. 10 issue of U.S. News and World Report, head of the draft system Gen. Lewis B. Hershey tells of a shortage in men available to fill the draft quota. He says that many men now listed as 1Y who failed the physical, those who are technically in the reserves but “are not doing anything” and men between the age of 19 and 26 and not in school are liable to the draft.

Of main concern to Davidson students is Hershey's idea of having each college submit a list of the lower quarter of each class to the draft boards if the draft quota is not met. “Deferment,” he says, “is a privilege;” the normal status of a man the proper age is 1A. Hershey gave this advice to the student: “Study. If you want to stay a student, be one.”

Hengeveld reiterated, however, that since no laws have been changed, there is no immediate need for concern. The Selective Service does not now require any information about grades or class status. Students are deferred annually, from Oct. 15 to Oct. 15, if they stay in school.

Student Body Drops Regulation On Drinking By One-Vote Edge Rule Against Gambling Kept By Close Margin

Davidson students in a referendum Tuesday voted 301 to 150 to repeal the drinking regulation of the Student Body Constitution. All the other regulations which were voted on in the referendum failed to receive the two-thirds majority necessary for repeal.

LACK OF CONTACT CITED Rush Complaints Aired By MASON STEPHENSON Davidsonian Staff Writer

The lack of contact between freshmen and upper-classmen was the major complaint this past week of fraternity presidents and faculty members concerning the rush regulations which were used this first semester.

The change in rush regulations this fall was brought about by the re-evaluation of the fraternity system last spring. The rules on contact between the upper- and lower-classmen were very strict in the delayed rush change. Instead of the rush period being limited to the first week of school, rush did not begin until Saturday, Oct. 30, and was stretched out over a period of two months.

Dr. W. G. McGavock, professor of mathematics, said that the program had answered a good many questions as to the academic performance of the students, the lack of an emotional buildup to rush and pledging, and the de-emphasis of fraternities. “No one expected the program to be a complete success, but it has answered some questions,” he stated. “I believe the system instead of being wrong has been effective enough so that the committee (Committee on Evaluation of Social Life) can take it and move on to another stage in solving the problems.”

Commenting on the academic performance of students, McGavock continued, “Mainly there has been a smoother academic procedure than we have ever had before.” But he sees some disadvantages in the program.

Journalist Calls War Integral Part Of Life By MIKE MAY Davidsonian Feature Writer

A different view of war and its advantages to mankind was presented to the student body by Anthony H. Harrigan in chapel Tuesday. The audience was rather sparse but apparently intensely concerned with the journalist's remarks.

“My subject is conflict,” began Harrigan, associate editor of The News and Courier. “The conflicts of our times are not greater than those of the past,” as far as fury and emotion are concerned. However, he pointed out that, “today conflict is conducted in a world-wide arena.” It has implications which no one can escape. “There is no place to hide. We have no choice but to learn to live with protracted conflict.”

The word protracted is a key one, according to the speaker. Wars such as we have today would have been almost inconceivable thirty years ago. “Then people thought of warfare in terms of a single decisive struggle.” Harrigan did not see war as undiluted evil, however. “The human cost of the wars of the last 50 years has been terrible,” he admitted. “Nevertheless,” he claimed, “vast new areas of knowledge were opened up as a result of competition on the battlefields.” Citing the American Civil War as an example, he said that America went into the Civil War as a rural nation and emerged as a full-fledged industrial state. Thus we must not automatically shy away from war, but view it with an eye to its potential advantage.

The speaker emphasized that the possibility of the necessity for increased warfare is quite real. “The Chinese Communists have decided that the pursuit of war is a positive good.” In the face of this belligerence the Western nations “are the proverbial lambs for the slaughter” if they do not change their attitude toward war. Then Harrigan let go with his real bombshell. History, he claimed, is the story of a continual struggle for power. “The natural state of things is war.”

“The long drawn out period,” McGavock said, “has been a strain on the upper classmen, but has tended to reduce the intensity of rush.” He continued that there had not been the build up of emotional strain like there had been in the past which was more common to the unpledging freshmen, since they did not meet rejection at the beginning of the year.

Dr. John Kelton, associate professor of psychology, said that he could not comment on the effects of rush on the freshmen, since he did not teach too many in his department, but that reports to him “have been good.” But commenting on the academic performance of the upper classmen Kelton said, “I could tell a big difference at the beginning of the semester; we were off to a better start.” He continued, “Rush did not interfere with the upper-classmen later, when rush came.”

COMPLAINTS

Outside of the classroom he had heard complaints concerning contact between the upper- and lower-classmen. “I am sorry that there were such strict rules on contact betweenFreshmen and upper-classmen; this is the biggest complaint,” he concluded. Charles Cornwell, instructor in English, did not think the rush rules had “unduly harmed the freshmen or the fraternity men,” and there had been no interference with work.

LEGALISM

The biggest objection from the students, according to him, was the extreme legalism determining the contact between the freshmen and fraternity men, and he termed them “excessive and undue.” Continuing, Cornwell stated, “I see no reason in not declaring open season on freshmen, and it would enable the freshmen to meet the upper-classmen.”

Walt Drake, president of ATO, said that rush this year had been a burden on the freshmen and fraternity men which was not necessary.

OLD SYSTEM

“I prefer a system of rush concentrated in a short period,” he stated, and generally he prefers the system of rush which has been used in the past. “There is individual merit in the delayed rush,” Drake concluded, “but overall, it was not as good as hoped.”

Ernie Larkin, KA president, said that “it wasn’t running too well, but we did benefit from it this year, we have learned to be honest with rush.” He continued that after this year either rush will be opened up, or it will be closed. “This half-way basis should come to an end,” concluded Larkin, but “the main thing we learned was how not to do things.”

Bill Skinner, president of Sigma Nu, said that rush was better than last year, but “it was too long and dragged out. Delaying for part of the year is good, but more contact is needed, like riding in cars.” However, Skinner stated, “the delayed rush doesn’t seem to have made much difference in the composition of the pledge classes.”

The drinking rule vote, one more than the needed two-thirds, repeals Section 2 of the Student Body Regulations. Abrogation of the gambling rule failed by only a few votes. This result is a reversal of last May’s campaign to repeal the drinking regulation when only 62 percent of the votes favored repeal. This year’s referendum was the result of a re-evaluation of Honor Court and Student Council responsibilities led by John Burks. Another aspect of this re-evaluation is the new “duty bound” clause in the oath of office to be administered to the Honor Court and Student Council on Monday.

COUNCIL

Student Body President Bill Council Tuesday night commented on the vote and what it means. “The repeal of the drinking rule,” stated Council, “is not the result of a general desire of the students to consume alcoholic beverages on campus. It is a result of student feeling that the rule is unrealistic and serves no definite end.” Council said that he does not believe that drinking on the Davidson campus will result in extreme disorderly conduct and disruption of the academic atmosphere. He further indicated that the faculty was strongly committed to a dry campus and that there was a possibility of dorm and room searches authorized by the faculty. It is also probable that the trunk rule will be repealed, according to Council.

DEFINITE RESPONSIBILITY

“The action taken by the students,” said Council, “requires that they show a definite responsibility and maturity. If they do act with responsibility, they will be able to maintain a certain amount of jurisdiction.” Council also said, “We will have to wait and see if the trustees take definite action. The administration has, however, made statements to the effect that if the students repeal the drinking rule, there may be an increase in security officers to enforce dorm searches,” added Council.

BURKS

John Burks, who initiated the referendum, was surprised that the drinking rule was the first to go. “I think that this shows that the student body at large does not want to be responsible for enforcing such a regulation. I also think that the fact that the drinking rule was the only one to be repealed was due in part to the students placing a great deal of emphasis and thought on this one and not considering the difficulty in the enforcement of some of the others,” said Burks. Burks did not believe that the administration would take any arbitrary policing action such as room searches.

ANOTHER REFERENDUM

Burks also stated that he would not be surprised if another referendum were held during next semester on some of the rules that were not repealed. Burks said that student courts should be concerned with important regulations and that demanding the whole student body or any group of students to be responsible for very poorly defined regulations places undue strain on student government. “If the administration sees that we are responsible, I think we can realistically hope they will condone on-campus drinking,” commented senior David Meschan, a member of the Student Council. “If, however, we show a lack of responsibility in this regard, they would be perfectly justified in taking stringent action.”

SIMPSON

Paul Simpson, who defended the drinking rule in chapel this week, commented that he feels “the administration, if it becomes evident that students are drinking on campus, will take any necessary action to see that this does not continue,” but added that he does not expect a significant increase in on-campus drinking. Burks agreed, “I think there will be more drinking on campus than there has been in the past, but I don’t think it will be very significant.”

Wednesday’s referendum followed a similar vote last spring when the regulations were retained. Meschan attributed the change to the fact that freshmen, who usually are more conservative than upperclassmen, could not vote this time.

Union Cafeteria Gets Replacement For Hill

The College Union cafeteria this week received a new resident manager, William T. Beckham, the third man to hold the position since last spring. Beckham replaces Harry Hill, who recently resigned from Slater Food Services. A college official was non-committal as to whether Hill’s resignation was connected with the large number of complaints the Slater Service has received about conditions in the Davidson cafeteria. He added that Hill underwent an emergency appendectomy last week and that his illness might have influenced his decision to resign. The official stated that the college asked the Slater Service early last fall to improve the food and service in the cafeteria. He added that Slater has been trying to do something about the situation ever since then. In addition to Beckham, Slater has also hired a new North Carolina district manager, Wayne Shroyer, who worked at Davidson for a short time last spring.

Registration Policy Changes Effected

Concrete results of Davidson’s recent Self-Study Report were offered by registrar F. W. Hengeveld this week in the form of a new policy for second semester registration. Under the new policy, every student must consult a faculty adviser concerning his schedule, even if he is taking continuous courses such as Math 11, 12. All students have received schedule sheets, which must bear a faculty member’s signature before Saturday’s deadline for registration.
