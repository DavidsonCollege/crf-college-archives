Football team offers plan to save money in exchange for another year in Division I-AA

By BRUCE NEWSOME
In a plan outlined in the Charlotte Observer last week, the football team showed how it could save almost half a million dollars next year. In exchange for these savings, the team asks that the school allow Davidson’s football program to remain at the Division I-AA level for at least next year.

The players and coaches want to have next year to prove that they belong at the Division I-AA level. Next year’s team would consist of Coach Vic Gatto’s first four full recruiting classes.

Assistant Coach Lee Sargent was quoted as saying, “We decided to sacrifice across the board in order that we not be liars. For many of us, it’s a question of honor.”

The plan points out eleven places that the team can save money.
1. Gatto would donate $7,000 of his salary to the Wildcat Club.
2. The six assistant coaches would work next season for $4,000 each.
3. The players would give the $200,000 that they receive in financial aid from the Wildcat Club to the school, in addition to donating $60,000 from summer job earnings.
4. The team would play only 10 games rather than 11 next year for a savings of $10,000.
5. There would be one less road game, which would save $7,000.
6. The coaches would reduce the number of paid recruiting visits to 50. This would save $17,500.
7. The coaches would also cut back on off-campus recruiting to save $25,000.
8. Four of the assistant coaches would become part-time at a savings of $81,750.
9. $67,500 would be saved by eliminating 15 of the financial aid grants to next year’s freshmen class.
10. The team would go without new uniforms next year in order to save $15,000.
11. The final cut would be in game films at a savings of $10,000.

The sum total of all these cuts is $490,250 out of a budget of about $800,000.

The entire board of trustees is scheduled to meet in mid-December to decide whether or not the Davidson football program will stay at Division I-AA, drop to Division III, or be dropped altogether.

Gatto was out of town this week and could not be reached for comment on the proposal.

UNCC loss drops Wildcats to 2-5

By LARRY DAGENHART
It was one of those games in which you just couldn’t buy a basket. Saturday night at the Charlotte Coliseum the Forty-Niners of UNCC (3-0) beat Davidson (2-5), 79-64, to capture the Hornet’s Nest trophy for the third straight year.

It was a sloppy game for both sides as Davidson and UNCC committed 18 and 19 turnovers, respectively. Both squads shot poorly, with Davidson at 35% from the floor. Maurice Gray was the only Wildcat in double figures with 11 points.

Davidson’s defense held 1988 Sun Belt Player of the Year Byron Dinkins in check in the first half, but he lit up the Wildcats in the second half, finishing with a game-high 21 points.

The Forty-Niners (a reference to UNCC’s location on Highway 49) shot 48% from the floor, but they were a miserable 14 of 24 from the free-throw line.

The young Wildcats played tenacious defense throughout and never allowed UNCC the blowout it had been expecting all week. Davidson also held its own on the boards, garnering 40 rebounds to UNCC’s 44.

The game almost turned into a blowout early in the second half. Trailing only 37-28 at halftime, Davidson opened the second stanza tentatively and allowed UNCC an 11-0 run that put the Niners up by 20. The Cats never fell more than 24 points behind and clawed their way back with some good play from freshmen. Davidson got 20 points from the combination of Sterling Freeman, Paul Denmond, and Paul Alan Hunter, who got 17 points, nine from three-pointers.

Last Monday, Davidson got a confidence-builder with a 90-80 win over Eckerd College, its first win since the Puerto Rico trip.

The game gave the Wildcats a chance to open things up a bit. Davidson had been averaging only 48 points a game and was coming off a miserable 24-point loss to Wofford, who hadn’t beaten Davidson since 1958.

Davidson was able to get some fast-break baskets from Magic Gaines and some solid play from reserves, something coach Bobby Hussey said that he’s been looking for.

He believes that giving reserves some experience “is a lot more important than putting a lot of points on the board.” Against Eckerd, Davidson got both, but against UNCC, it wasn’t so lucky.

The Wildcats faced Erskine College in a late game last night in Johnston Gym. They will take on Marathon Oil in an exhibition next Sunday.

A picture is worth a thousand words (and it really helps break up gray pages!)

Dear Santa,
This has been a very trying year for all of us. I have a very long list on behalf of the College.

First, we would like to be among U.S. News’ top 10 Colleges next year while retaining that really cool small college feel.

Second, could we have about 10 more basketball team wins and a Conference championship?

And a football team that wins occasionally would be nice too. With Tim and his shoulder injury, we really need some help. I know just who to call...
