**Bats warrant quicker response**

What do the quaint town of Davidson and the fictional metropolis of Gotham City have in common? They each have
a “bat cave,” at least of sorts. Residents of Watts Residence Hall were recently awoken with the fluttering sound of
a bat flying around their room. Days later, another bat was found to have entered a Watts room through an
open window, and yet another was thought to have entered a student’s room through holes in a closet.

Yet as shocking as these incidents may seem, Watts’ bat problem is hardly new. There have been reported incidents of
bats in Watts since at least the fall of 2003, and by some accounts, bats have inhabited their own “bat
cave” in Watts’ attic even longer. While the bat problem is clearly not new, the Residence Life Office has thankfully
responded quickly to the incident this year by contacting a pest control company as soon as the incident was reported.
RLO should be congratulated for their quick initial response to this problem. However, their actions since then have not been
quite as commendable.

Residents of Fourth Watts who filled out work orders requesting screens be put on their windows so that bats that
were still congregating outside the building would not fly in through open windows have still not gotten their requests fulfilled.
There is no reason why a simple request for screens to be placed on windows should take so long, especially
when the consequences of not placing screens could mean bats flying in windows in the middle of the night. Don’t
Davidson students have the right to open the windows of their residence halls without the fear of a bat flying
in and causing a disturbance? The idea of waking up and finding bats hanging from one’s ceiling is not a
pleasant thought to most students, and RLO should be doing everything in their power to get rid of this problem
completely as soon as possible.

Instead of completing the simple task of installing screens, RLO sent an email to Watts residents saying that those bats
who remain outside the building are “welcome neighbors because they consume mosquitoes and other flying insects; for example, a little
brown bat can consume up to 1200 flying insects in an hour.” While RLO should get credit for their creative
excuse for ignoring this problem, ensuring that Fourth Watts residents have screens on their windows to protect them from the
bats should be their first priority.

**Pass/Fail deadline extended**

Davidson students, as we all know, want not only to succeed but also to get the full benefit of a
liberal arts education. To do this, we must take classes, write papers, and discuss topics that are outside the realm
of our usual mind frame each semester. We are very lucky to have the option of taking a class pass/fail
for it allows us to branch outside our major, minor, or comfort zone and take classes we may not have
taken under the usual guidelines.

That being said, many students were unhappy with the timeline of declaring a class pass/fail. Students argued that the old
deadline—6 weeks into the semester—did not allow them a chance to get a sense of the class, from both a
content and a grade standpoint. With the recently approved extension through the recommendation of the Educational Policy Committee and the
Student Government Association, the faculty voted to extend the deadline for declaration from six weeks to nine weeks. I believe
this change will allow students to absorb the full benefits of taking a class they may not normally have taken.
With only a limited amount of time around such amazing professors and class topics, it is necessary for all of
us to take advantage of these resources. I hope this change allows students to do so more fully. Thank you
to all who helped support the change. The extension of the deadline exemplifies how student concerns can result in positive
change.

**Cable Information**

I want to update the campus community on our efforts to provide cable TV service to all residence hall rooms.
Campus wiring was accomplished far faster than expected and all residence halls and apartment buildings are now receiving cable television
service from our new provider, Campus Televideo, which repackages offerings from several satellite services to meet the needs of campus
communities. Unfortunately, Campus [text cuts off]Televideo reports a nationwide problem with channels provided by the Dish Network: Channels have been
“freezing,” sometimes several times daily. Although other channels remain operational, the affected channel remains frozen until the receiver is manually
rebooted by Davidson College's ITS personnel. Dish has been unable to correct the problem. At the request of DirecTV, this
will cause some change in channel line-up and offerings. After the conversion, CAT-TV will no longer offer PAX, Boomerang, E!
Style, Hallmark, and Reality TV. However, the following channels will be added to the CAT-TV line-up: College Sports TV, FX,
MSNBC, Spike, and Women’s Entertainment. Davidson College has requested Campus Televideo’s earliest possible conversion date. At present, it is unclear
exactly when Campus Televideo can schedule the conversion. We hope still to meet our target date of Fall Break for
full, trouble-free cable service. Watch the CAT-TV website (http://www2.davidson.edu/its/cattv/cattv_home.asp) for the latest status updates and conversion schedules. In the meantime,
please use the web form to report problems with reception, especially “freezing” of channels. ITS personnel will service the receivers
during weekday business hours. They are not able to provide nighttime or weekend service, so channels may remain frozen until
the next business day. Although disappointing, glitches and malfunctions are to be expected in new technological projects of this scope.
Anticipation of technical problems and service disruption is one reason RLO is not passing cable costs on to students during
this first year. Be assured that RLO, ITS, Physical Plant, and Campus Televideo are all working diligently to correct problems
as quickly as possible. In the meantime, we appreciate your continued patience.

In a flood of opinions, ride your own raft
By Ros Ruscu
Staff Columnist

In this day and time, society often decapitates logic with the bitter swipe of a double-edged sword. With contradictions and
stereotypes abound, we are given a thousand subtle suggestions, each with their own unclear purpose, while at the same time
we are told how to defy those very concepts. The thin red line between right and wrong is blurred beyond
comprehension by the double standards of society, leaving many to drown in the anxiety of hazy choices and stuttering consciences.
To understand such a maze, one must find the source of the double standard. Inevitably such contradictions lie in the
inherent freedom of the human mind and the surrounding medium with which to project such freedom. Today we see such
expressions widely broadcast on TV and in magazines and more localized in a city function or even the general way
an individual acts. Each of these, from a Saturday sitcom to a precarious sentence, provides us with specific stimuli and
works to meld our character. Each represents a standard. Together, all these standards embody the standard of society. Every action
we take is incorporated into the equation that calculates society’s standard, while at the same time, society’s standard factors into
our own personal equation of standard. This fluctuation of inputs and outputs invariably creates a world with contradictions and double
standards as free ideas run rampant, stimulating reactions and creating new bounds for morality. Society is a living creature evolving
with the individuals that make it up. Political, economical, personal, and religious disagreements create knowledge pools of conflicting information. Each
side stresses the fact that it is right and urges the rest of society to join its cause. This action
is actually healthy for society as a whole. Conflict spurs the evolution of new ideas and general advancements in morality
and technology. However, as an individual; you, me, she, and he; one often falls into the abyssal sea between these
varying rights and wrongs. The deluge of opinions often drowns one in confusion, complicating the choice of right and wrong.
This can often lead to stress when making a decision and likely to guilt once a decision has been made.
No matter what one does, someone will find it wrong and someone will find it right. In this world of
double standards, one must find their own standard. One cannot accept the myriad of ideas floating across the sky; they
are only there to consider. Each has to accept what they believe and how they believe it, standing stoically firm
in an ocean of honest deceit and bitter half-truths.
