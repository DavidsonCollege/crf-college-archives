**Trial focuses interest on applications of Honor Code**

Students pushed and shoved only to stand in the back of the heated 900 Room, straining for each syllable the Defense Advisor uttered. Flags were distributed as a hall program. The first open Honor Council trial in longer than administrators can remember (there was one in May 1997, but it was opened five minutes before proceedings occurred) became a campus-wide event. Senior Ryan Gist’s trial sparked opinion and conversation regarding the Honor Code and Code of Responsibility.

“I hope, given the rare opportunity to see a hearing in progress, that students realize the critical role they have in the process,” said Dean of Students Tom Shandley. “When you describe the Honor Code, I think there’s a measure of respect, a lot of students cite it as the reason for coming to Davidson, and also fear because the consequences are potentially so serious. Basically, the Honor Code says ‘I won’t lie, steal, or cheat.’ It is less ambiguous than the Code of Responsibility which governs behaviors. The Code of Responsibility is much more subjective and much more difficult to define.”

Yet, even an Honor Code violation can be difficult to discern. Every student is honor-bound to report Honor Code allegations, but Code of Responsibility allegations can sometimes be settled before a trial occurs. Faculty and staff do not sign the Honor Code, but often find themselves interpreting it, especially in cases of plagiarism, where intent is questioned.

“It’s a system where all members of the community have responsibility to see the Codes carried out,” said Assistant Dean of Students Ernest Jeffries. “That’s what makes Davidson so special. Peers are willing to uphold standards and make each other accountable. Students have such respect for each other that sometimes the Code of Responsibility is the last alternative.”

Last year, there were 32 Code of Responsibility and 11 Honor Code violations. There was also over $80,000 worth of backpacks, purses, office materials, and other personal belongings stolen. Around $57,000 was recovered, mostly from people outside of the College, according to Chief of Campus Police Rick Moore.

“The number of trials does not reflect the code violations on campus. I have a hard time believing that they ever will,” said junior Kurt Fesenmyer. “People have no reason not to understand the rules, although they have enough responsibility to report blatant offenses. It is just that all offenses are not blatant and not public.”

When a person is alleged to have committed a Code of Responsibility or Honor Code violation, Dean Shandley reviews the case to determine if there is enough substance to proceed. If so, then he or she receives a letter detailing what specifically has been alleged. After receiving the letter, he or she attends an administrative conference with either Dean Shandley or Dean Jeffries to plead guilty or not guilty. If it is a Code of Responsibility violation and the person pleads guilty, the Judicial Committee composed of three Honor Council members, two faculty, and Dean Jeffries determines sanctions. If the violation deals with the Honor Code or the person pleads not guilty to a Code of Responsibility allegation, then the Honor Council hears the case and determines sanctions.

“What is the most underestimated thing about the Honor Council is the seriousness with which they take their task,” said Shandley. “It is not unusual that they spend 6-9 hours on a hearing because they know their responsibility and the difficulty of the decision that they have to make.”

As one can see from the length of time deliberations occur, a code violation is not always straightforward. “I think that we as students do take the Honor Code seriously, but have a much different sense of scale than the written code, which is a bit too grave for what most of us would consider minor offenses,” said junior Vic Brand.

Often, it is only students in authority positions like Resident Advisors and Hall Counselors who report their peer’s misconduct. “Students in non-authoritarian positions do not file Code of Responsibility reports because they do not think it is their duty, are afraid of the system, and do not completely understand how it works,” said junior Scott Reeder. “I think that the Honor Code and the turning of a person in on an offense is for most people like turning someone in to the police.”

**Administration responds to Gist trial, coverage**

“The very best thing that came out of the articles of the past week’s Davidsonian,” Dean of Students Tom Shandley said, “is that it illuminates for the students the importance of the Honor Council, and the elections in which you choose the students who are part of the Honor Council, who are the solicitors, who are the defense advisors.

“And, I think both the paper and the hearing gave students the rare opportunity to see how it all functions,” Shandley said.

Last week, the Davidsonian was expanded to 20 pages to allow full coverage of the Honor Council hearing for Ryan Gist, a senior ROTC cadet who was accused of violating Section Three of the Code of Responsibility. A full transcription of the trial, as well as editorials and letters to the editor from the student population were included in the coverage.

Assistant Dean of Students and Director of Minority Student Affairs Ernest Jeffries thought the coverage “raised awareness with students.” However, he said, “I didn’t really have a strong opinion either way.”

“It’s fine to criticize the process,” Shandley said of the opinions section. “The job at this part [the initial meeting with the Dean’s office] is not to determine the innocence or guilt of a student. Just, is there enough evidence to suggest...”an Honor Code violation, or a Code of Responsibility violation?” Jeffries found the student opinions “interesting,” commenting that the section “wasn’t totally one-sided.” Jeffries said the articles “brought up some good issues.” Jeffries found the poll results indicative of a “problem that needs to be addressed by the school,” and pointed out that the Honor Council is currently planning a forum. The forum will give students an opportunity to address student concerns about the Honor Code and Honor Council, both in general and in the context of the Gist trial, according to Charlotte Hildebrand, chairperson of the Honor Council.

“...over to the KGB: it’s the most serious legal action that can be taken against a Davidson student, and so we try to find other ways of solving our problems before resorting to those more drastic measures,” said Brand.

Beyond the complexity of the Codes, the actual Honor Council is somewhat mysterious. “I understood the duties of my role on Honor Council a little bit before elections, but mostly afterwards,” said Student Solicitor Virginia Fisher. “Before, I knew the rough outline, but had no idea what an overwhelmingly emotional and time-consuming position it is.” Recently elected sophomore Honor Council member Liz Clasen knows very little about how the Honor Council is run or what her role will be. “If the Honor Council made students more aware of the process both the accuser and accused go through before, during, and after the trial, perhaps students would be more comfortable reporting violations,” said Clasen.

The Red Book provides much of that information, but students’ eagerness to read the 95-page document is not very high. “I have never really read the Codes all the way through, but I think my own judgment between right and wrong is sufficient,” said sophomore Mitch Shores. “I believe that if they really wanted to know, they would,” said Fisher. “It is all stated in the Red Book. Unfortunately, no one really takes the time to read it. In many cases, reading it would save some people trouble in the long run.”

Changes in the Honor Code and the Code of Responsibility are done through the Student Conduct Council. SCC is currently examining the significance of intent in cases where the Honor Council imposes sanctions. The Honor Council can presently consider intent only in the process of finding a person guilty or not guilty. SCC is investigating whether or not the Honor Council wants to add the word “intent” to the standards of imposing sanctions under Hearing Procedures before the Honor Council. SCC is also pushing to educate upperclass students about the Honor Code. “I'd like to see if SCC can find a means of informing students of precedents that the Honor Council has set, while preserving anonymity in the cases,” said Senior Class President and ex officio SCC member Tim Saintsing. “Can you get kicked out of school for three footnotes that are missing in a paper or at twelve do they suspend you for two semesters,” he asked. “Students need to be informed about how the Honor Code is enforced.”

“Every student has the opportunity to run and vote for an Honor Council position, and every student has the opportunity to voice concerns if they don’t like the way that system runs,” said Shandley. “And every student has the obligation to understand the process. I hope the interest generated in that trial [Gist’s] spurs interest in the process in general.”

Davidson to provide Room in the Inn

Beginning in January 1998, the Chapel Committee will be sponsoring a homeless program called Room in the Inn. The program is an effort to minister to the growing homeless population in neighboring Charlotte. Room in the Inn was started by the Urban Ministry League in Nashville, Tenn., to help house the homeless population when shelters overflowed. Surrounding churches aided the program by providing meals and extra space for needy individuals. The homeless are screened for weapons and inebriation before being taken to a supporting facility. There, they are provided with dinner, a warm place to spend the night, and a breakfast before being transported back to the original shelter.

Davidson is only the second college to bring Room in the Inn to a campus. Liz Clasen, the head of the Chapel Committee and the director of Room in the Inn at Davidson, brought this program to campus in hopes of enlightening students on the homeless situation. Mental illness, alcoholism, drug addiction, and lack of low-income housing all contribute to homelessness in Charlotte. While Room in the Inn provides only a short-term solution to the problem, it does give needy individuals a place to turn. Room in the Inn will begin in January and last until the end of March, taking place each Saturday night. Student volunteers will be divided into three groups and rotate through nine weeks of service, providing transportation, meals, and company to the five homeless people brought to campus. Participants will undergo a full training semester in the fall to break the stereotypes of homeless life and learn how to react to situations they may encounter. The program will host meals in Vail Commons and provide sleeping facilities in the old wrestling room at Johnston Gym.
