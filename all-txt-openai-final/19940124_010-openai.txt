Still Whistlin' Dixie

More good than bad so country music fans can brag about 1993

By Geoff Graham

For those of you who, when looking back on 1993, remember nothing but the bitterness of “Money in the Bank”
or “Haunted Heart,” I have a list of songs which I hope will brighten your memories. Though the past year
had more than its share of embarrassments (Tanya Tucker and Club Dance on TNN), the Country music industry still has
a lot to brag about.

George Strait’s movie, Pure Country, will most certainly be nominated for an Oscar in either the “best musical score” or
“best actor” categories. The Common Threads album united the Eagles with Country and helped to save Walden Woods all in
one fell swoop. The next generation of artists looks promising with the appearance of Clay Walker, Faith Hill, and Doug
Supernaw (not to mention Dude Mowrey and Shawn Camp, two dudes barely out of their teens). Clint Black, Alan Jackson,
and George Strait released strong albums. Steve Wariner began his comeback. I visited Nashville for the first time. The good
definitely outweighed the bad in 1993.

If this mere sampling of the positive doesn’t convince you of the year’s greatness, take a gander at my list
of favorite songs (some of these might be from 1992, but I don’t think they really became popular until last
year).

1. Radney Foster, “Easier Said than Done”
If you haven’t bought his album Del Rio, Texas 1959, get your tail to the record store. Rad puts real
heart and soul into his music and you won’t be disappointed.

2. Clint Black, “State of Mind”
I drove seven hours to see Clint play and he canceled the show. If I can still put this song
at number two, you know it’s got to be great.

3. George Strait, “I Cross My Heart”
A fantastic love song from a fantastic movie with a fantastic soundtrack.

4. Doug Supernaw, “I Don’t Call Him Daddy”
This is one of the greatest written songs of the year. Doug really got his foot in the door with
this one.

5. Sawyer Brown, “All These Years”

Old music records have continued from page 9

labels such as Sub-Pop, Matador, and Caroline. Moreover, mega-groups of today such as REM, U2, Nirvana, and Urge Overkill owe
a tremendous part of their success to the record industry.

In addition, the clubs and dance music continue to keep vinyl alive. Ask any MC (although it might be difficult
to do so on this campus) and he or she will tell you that for all practical purposes records mix
better and allow a steadier flow of tempo than CDs or tapes. Ever wonder how each song seems to melt
neatly into the other? This phenomenon is the result of our friend the record.

Quite simply, vinyl, although technologically outdated, is an essential part of our musical heritage that is all too quickly being
forgotten or overlooked. Many influential artists would never have been able to withstand the colossal price of production had it
not been for this method of recording sound. The same holds true for musicians today.

Furthermore, in my opinion vinyl more effectively reveals the true art behind music. They obviously don’t sound as good as
the CD. However, in their warbled imperfection, they do allow for a greater degree of reflection and thought as to
what the truer, purer definition of sound might be. Listening to Jimi Hendrix on vinyl is truly an illuminating experience.
I can picture myself in Monterey in 1967 listening to his infectious music.

Finally, although CD cases are handy and have qualities of display, they don’t compare to the jacket of a record.
Album covers to records are meant to be seen and handled with delicate care. They’re art themselves as they more
effectively convey the feelings of the artist than a small CD picture.

There’s no denying that CDs are great. However, the record is not just an invention to be written off by
better developments in the audio production. It can still hold its own. Many people are quickly starting to realize this
fact.

Years” I can’t understand why these boys aren’t more popular when they consistently release powerful songs like this, “Cafe on
the Corner,” and “The Dirt Road.”
6. Patty Loveless, “Nothin’ but the Wheel” This song really moved me. I felt it deserved a lot more air
time than it received, but in a way I’m glad. Constant overplaying spoiled too many songs for me in 1993.
7. Steve Wariner, “If I Didn’t Love You” Steve solidified his comeback with this piece in addition to his song
“Drivin’ and Cryin’.” It’s good to have this veteran back in the stream of things.
8. Alan Jackson, “Chattahoochee” I know what you’re thinking. So far the list has included serious, or at least somewhat
deep, songs. Well, “Chattahoochee” may be a little light-hearted, but it does have a deeper meaning: don’t forget where you
came from and the lessons you took with you. I came from the small town of Atlanta, nestled on the
quiet banks of the lazy Chattahoochee, and I’ve dipped in its waters more than once. Sentimentality demands I include it
on my list.
9. George Strait, “Easy Come, Easy Go” George Strait is great, there’s just no denying it. And he can act,
too. Really.
10. Martina McBride, “The Way that I Am” I love this song, but in all seriousness, have you ever seen
Martina McBride? She’s singing “my baby loves me just the way that I am,” but she just might be the
most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen. If I were her baby I’d love her just the way that she is,
too. Martina will be mine. Oh yes, she will be mine.

Well, there it is. Geoff Graham’s favorite Country tunes of 1993. If anyone forgot to get me a Christmas present,
I’d love a tape of all these songs. I hope your holidays went well and you all got brand new
cowboy boots. Take care and have a happy new year.
