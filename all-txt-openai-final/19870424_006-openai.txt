**Tin Men: An Excursion into Baltimore’s Dreamy Past**
By BRUCE PLOURDE

Do you remember thinking to yourself, “A movie about detention on Saturday? Who are they kidding?” And yet we learned
that The Breakfast Club dealt with much more than detention hall. Likewise for Tin Men. A movie about aluminum-siding salesmen
doesn’t exactly bring to mind images of Indiana Jones. Yet from the very start, the film engages our human interest.

The tale takes place in the Baltimore of the early 1960s. The motif of tin, metal, and the like appear
in every aspect of the film and unifies the subplots. The frame structure follows the tin salesmen and their various
wily schemes to sell aluminum siding to reluctant homeowners. The ploys they devise rely heavily on the salesman’s cunning and
ability to judge a prospect’s psychological reactions. Selling aluminum becomes a game of wits, and the players pride themselves on
their prowess. They sport their tail-finned Cadillacs as a symbol of their success.

The Cadillacs, in fact, bring together the two most important tin men in the story. Richard Dreyfuss purchases his new
finned metallic-blue Caddie and backs out of the dealership. Halfway into the street, Danny DeVito, driving his symbol of success,
smashes into the side of his new car. Both men leap out and accuse the other of idiocy. They vow
to even the score and spend the rest of the movie trying to do so, escalating the retribution at every
turn. Both men have entirely despicable sides to their nature. Yet both men have a warm, likeable side as well.
As their hatred toward each other increases, the audience can’t help but be drawn into their world.

**Bachelor Party: Strange Equity: Both Sexes Stripped of Dignity**
By FLORENCE SNIVELY

Are you looking for a good belly-laugh you can take home with you and remember at odd times? Bachelor Party
supplies a two-hour series of adolescent giggles but lacks a central, amusing punch. Rick Gasko (Tom Hanks), the main character,
is introduced as a school bus driver with a not-very-well-suppressed desire to be a standup comic. Everything feeds his comic
impulses, creating an endless stream of mildly amusing one-liners. His goal in life is to make people look like the
fools they are. This is very effective—nuns continue to berate him for irresponsibility and for his flip attitude, his fiancée’s
parents encourage other suitors to keep trying two weeks before the wedding.

Rick Gasko is a decent guy despite what the rest of mainstream humanity thinks; he does not laugh at people
trying to commit suicide. When his fiancée tells him of her worries, he comforts her. The combination has strange results:
Rick Gasko comes off as Honest Abe Lincoln—with a genital fixation.

Debbie Thompson (Tawny Kitaen), his fiancée, is the straight man in this comedy routine. Her world is funny; the fitting
rooms at the boutique where she works are missing something (doors), her father’s (George Grizzard) inappropriate, grown-up-preppy behavior is missing
something (maturity, a sense of humor). Debbie herself is missing something: depth of personality. She is a whining nincompoop. How
could she possibly doubt Rick’s devotion to her? If she cannot see past Rick’s compulsive entertainment, why is she planning
to marry him? To her cousin, she says, “I trust Rick,” but her behavior shows otherwise.Reality is further complicated by
the existence of Cole Whittier (Robert Prescott), preppy dream-boy, Debbie’s former boyfriend. Cole is extremely attractive, extremely rich, and is
still going through intellectual puberty. He cannot understand why, if he has his father’s consent to marry Debbie, he should
need hers as well. Cole wanders through the slapstick finding things to trade for Debbie, like a small boy who
found the wrong Hot Wheels car in his cereal box. When this fails, he resorts to extremely mature and well-planned
subterfuge.

The plot of the movie is complex: Rick promises Debbie he won't have sex at his bachelor party. Blinked? Too
bad, you missed it. That’s all you get. The movie degenerates into a kind of one-upmanship contest between the men
at the bachelor party and the women at the bridal shower: how can the women get revenge on the men;
how can the men best forget they are still (loosely defined) thinking creatures? Unlike other light-hearted sex-flicks, Bachelor Party does
not demean women because it shows them as handy carrying-cases for sexual equipment. Bachelor Party gives men and women equal
time in the demeaning department. If women come to the party to show off their breasts, the men do no
better at the male strip joint the women visit. Neither gender is left any dignity. It is a refreshing change
to watch a movie that, as a new twist on old morality, considers the entire human race handy carrying-cases for
sexual equipment. Maybe. Still in all, Bachelor Party is sort of amusing. If you’re not looking for a meaningful relationship
with a movie, it’s probably worth some time. Possibly the most fun you’ll have all evening is reading the credits;
they had to work pretty hard to distinguish in a phrase which of the two-thousand bit-parts was which. But if,
(Oh horror and personal condemnation) you abandon your Davidson IQ and that desperate thirst for academic knowledge to cut loose
and exercise those most-denied parts of your mature and repressed personality, stop by for any half-hour of Bachelor Party. Heaven
forbid, you might be entertained. Bachelor Party will be shown at 9:45 p.m. on Friday in the 900 Room.

This dramatic irony provides the opportunity for them to reveal both sides of their characters. Apart from the central conflict
between Dreyfuss and DeVito, the verity of the portrayal of city life adds to the appeal of Tin Men. Brief
glimpses and caught fragments of conversation illuminate the joy and vigor of the everyday passage of time. Although most of
the tin men talk with hackneyed voices and expressions, DeVito often shows a tendency to use an almost-Tidewater accent, music
amongst cacophony. His friends talk incessantly about how inane Hoss and Little Joe seem on Bonanza. The director has taken
care to show the sweetest morsels of life in Baltimore in the era following McCarthyism. One cannot put this movie
unquestionably into one class. It has elements of comedy and drama in it, yet it is not totally either. Perhaps
the best way to categorize Tin Men is to join it to the likes of movies such as Diner and
American Graffiti. For an excursion into the dreamy past, see Tin Men.
