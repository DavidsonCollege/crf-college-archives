**The DAVIDSONIAN, January 22, 1919**

**The Friendly Spirit On Davidson Campus**

**“Who Is My Neighbor?” Subject At Weekly “Y” Meeting.**

In his talk before the Y. M. C. A. Sunday afternoon, Mr. Miles chose as his subject, “Who Is My
Neighbor?”

“This Parable of the Good Samaritan, so well known to us all,” said Mr. Miles in beginning, “is so often
forgotten.”

“And this question, ‘Who is my neighbor,’ is,” declared the speaker, “one that concerns us much.” As a specific instance,
he pointed out how unneighborliness among the peoples of Europe had resulted in the big European war. Serbia, Bulgaria, Montenegro,
Greece, and Turkey all hated each other. Russia hated Austria, and Austria hated Serbia, France hated Germany.

“These countries did not look upon the peoples of foreign states as their neighbors. Today a great Peace Congress sits
in France to determine ‘Who is my neighbor’ and what action should be taken towards him.”

Mr. Miles said that if the teachings of Jesus be summarized, it might be called “How to live” and that
the method would be called “Love.” Christ commanded, “Love thy neighbor as thyself.” Mr. Miles declared that the capitalized personal
pronoun “I” must be transformed into the personal pronoun “You.” “And,” he continued, “every man on Davidson campus is your
neighbor.”

It behooves all to make it a point to be friendly. It is a thing we owe to the other
fellow. My neighbor on Davidson campus is not strictly the fellow in my fraternity, or my literary society, but every
man here,” he said.

Mr. Miles pointed out several ways in which neighborliness might be shown. In the first place, “Speak to every man
on the campus.” Mr. Miles said that this has always been a splendid custom at Davidson. It means much to
say just a word of greeting as you pass a fellow on the college walks. Again, upperclassmen should treat the
Freshmen in that spirit, “As ye would that others should do to you.” The upperclassmen can each recall the friendly
acts or words of some older fellow by whom they happened to be befriended their first year. “The Freshman is
human, and appreciates kindness. The upperclassman owes it to the Freshman.”

Mr. Miles closed with a plea for greater friendliness and co-operation among the fellows on the campus. “Be loyal to
your college first, then loyal to the literary society, class. Have the spirit of friendliness,” he said.

**ONLY ONE DEBATING TEAM THIS SPRING**

At a meeting of the Debating Council last week, after due consideration, it was decided to put out only one
Intercollegiate Debating Team this year, provided a suitable debate could be arranged. Immediate steps have been taken to this effect,
and it is hoped that a contract may be duly signed in the near future. A list of the society
contests will be published within the next week or so.

**IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT:**

- Liston will not keep his mouth shut.
- That Spense talks also.
- That Pebble Stone ditto.
- That Tremain smoked a cigarette.
- That R. O. T. C. would begin soon.
- That Charlie Hall tried to grow a mustache.
- That Sanderson got a haircut.
- That Bitzer does not blow the bugle.
- That Fricker does not eat anything.
- That the Davidson College Magazine will not appear.
- That the Annual will.
- That Jim Witherspoon takes Greek VI.
- That “Red” Smith has more grit than Jim Boulware.

**MARGARITE CLARK AND ALICE JOYCE VISIT Y BLDG.**

The movies have come.to Davidson, and come to stay. Tuesday, the 14th, the gymnasium was filled with a happy crowd,
gathered to see the first show. As the pictures appeared upon the screen, shouts and laughter rent the air. "The
Halfback" and "Gallegher" were much appreciated. In the intervals between reels, A. P. Ormond rendered several selections upon the piano.
On Thursday night, "The Amazons," with Marguerite Clarke, scored a tremendous hit. The picture was full of "dramatic" situations which
were applauded enthusiastically. Two more enjoyable shows were given on Saturday and Tuesday, one of which featured Alice Joyce. At
the first show, the operators had a little trouble with the machine. However, the house was expecting some trouble, and
it did not lessen their enjoyment. Experience brought wisdom, and Rogers, '22, and Bernau, '21, succeeded in putting "The Amazons"
across with only one accident! They put the third reel in backwards, and when the writing appeared, a howl arose.
The operators are improving. And, before you know it, the movies here will be as good as any in the
State, and the best part is that they are free to all. After the first of February, the movies will
be on Tuesday and Saturday nights. On Tuesdays, the hour is 6:45, on Saturdays, 8:30. Of course, if a basketball
game is scheduled for Saturday night, the movie hour will be changed. This will probably be necessary only two or
three times in the whole year. In the meantime, before February, the show will be held Tuesday and Friday at
6:45 p.m. Mr. Miles expects to follow the above schedule as far as possible. B. E. Shields and W. M.
Scart, at piano and drum, add much to the enjoyment of the pictures by their stirring music.
