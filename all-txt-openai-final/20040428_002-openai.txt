### New organization to create database of field opportunities

**By ZACH KAZIOR Staff Writer**

The Davidson International Development Initiative (DIDI) is up and running. It will hold its first meeting next fall. A group of students formed the organization, which obtained its charter in March, with the goal of improving awareness and communication in international development in the community. The group will serve as a guidance role for those who are enthusiastic about international development and intend to explore the issue abroad and after college.

One way in which DIDI hopes to pursue this role is through an initiative they have undertaken in collaboration with Davidson International Association (DIA). The groups will create the Davidson International Network (DIN) and have applied for the $10,000 Improve Davidson Fund for financial support. This database will give students interested in international development access to a variety of opportunities in the field.

International development includes programs and policies that deal with issues such as economic growth, agriculture, trade, global health, humanitarian assistance, and conflict prevention. Julie Goff ’05, one of DIDI’s founding members said, “It is a highly interdisciplinary field which is why we see a need for an on-campus setting to bring students of different academic backgrounds together to discuss some of the biggest challenges our increasingly globalized world currently faces.”

DIDI will be meeting regularly to discuss specifictopics, and will be hearing from students and faculty who have traveled abroad and experienced first-hand some successes and failures in any number of international development projects and policies. Guest speakers are planned for next fall and spring in the hopes that they can better address some of the issues that students are interested in. DIDI currently has the support of a number of academic departments on campus, including the economics and political science departments. The group has also been working closely with the Dean Rusk International Studies program and professors specializing in certain aspects of international development.

The organization plans on incorporating alumni currently working in the field of international development, whether it is through online publications or through on-campus workshops. The new resource, DIN, will create a website, which would provide a means of communication, focused on international development, between and among alumni, faculty, student organizations, and students. The website will provide a forum to share ideas, seek guidance, and inquire about available positions. An alumni database will also be created and be made available online. This database would include all Davidson alumni and contacts involved in the development sector around the world. DIA President Stella Kenyi ’05 said the database would be a great opportunity for international students to continue promoting international awareness on campus. Kenyi said, “Since numerous DIA members are interested in pursuing their international interest after Davidson, DIA and DIDI’s collaboration in the creation of this database would give DIA members and the student body access to a wealth of networks and opportunities.”

“[DIDI] will continue to encourage students’ passions for the global community and foster the spirit of lifetime service that this college seeks to instill in all students.” --Julie Goff ’05

DIN will also offer an online publication featuring students, faculty, and alumni who have had experiences in international development. The organization also hopes to organize a workshop, bringing in Davidson alumni to campus with experience in the field of international development, in which students would learn how to take advantage of opportunities in the field. Goff said, “We would like our regular discussions, which will usually have some required reading ahead of time, and multi-faceted website to be a place where students can learn, think through ideas with students, faculty, and alumni—not necessarily in their department or classes—and be encouraged that work in the field of international development is necessary and feasible. Often this area of work has a less conventional career path and young students don’t know where to begin or what needs to be done.

“Undoubtedly the DIDI will evolve into the organization that will meet students' changing interests and needs, but [we] hope it will continue to encourage students’ passions for the global community and foster the spirit of lifetime service that this college seeks to instill in all students.”
