BEAT STATE 48 ALENDA LUX. Volume XXXVII DAVIDSON, NORTH CAROLINA, NUMBER 3

This year the Davidson YMCA will have as the speaker of its Fall Services, the Rev. Raymond Irving Lindquist, of the First Presbyterian Church of Orange, New Jersey. Dr. Lindquist was born in Nebraska, the son of a Presbyterian minister; he grew up in Texas and California, attended college in Illinois, and studied at Princeton and Cumberland, where he received his M.A. and D.D. degrees. Following a two-year period of study abroad, Dr. Lindquist returned to the United States to take up his ministry at his present pastorate, the historic old First Church of Orange, N.J.

Dr. Lindquist is noted for his particular appeal to youth, and for the past few years he has traveled extensively throughout the United States, inspiring our Christian Youth with his talks and lectures. Dr. Lindquist will speak at the mid-day chapel services on the 12, 13, 14 of October and will preach at Chambers Auditorium on these three evenings at 7:15 P.M. He will be followed by a special President’s dinner set for six o'clock in the evening. Dr. Lindquist will eat at the various boarding houses throughout his stay here and will be available for conference by appointments made with Bill Smith, Y secretary.

The Fall Services are presented each year in an effort to make the student see the challenge and inspiration toward a richer, fuller life. Each student is cordially invited to become a part of these services each evening throughout the week.

Phi Mu Alpha Plans Musical Activities

The first regular meeting of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia fraternity was held at 7:15 Monday, Oct. 4, in the chapter’s meeting room in Oak Row. At that time plans were discussed for the coming year. The program chairman announced that musical programs of interest to the student body and the fraternity will be presented on the third Monday of each month by members of the faculty, the fraternity, and guest artists. Plans for a joint recital with members of the Mu Phi Epsilon Sorority, national music sorority at Queens, were discussed and heartily approved. It is also hoped that the two organizations can arrange to have a social function during the year — possibly at Erwin Lodge.

As has been the custom in past years, Phi Mu Alpha will sponsor and conduct the annual Interfraternity Sing in cooperation with the Pan-Hellenic Council. This event will take place sometime in the spring. In the past, the Sing has created wide interest and keen competing groups, and it is hoped that this year’s contest will be the most successful to date. In connection with the annual Spring Fine Arts Festival, the fraternity expects to sponsor once again a showing of art-work with exhibitions from both local and outside artists.

Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia is a national Honorary Music Fraternity with approximately eighty chapters in leading colleges and universities throughout the United States. Its purpose is to foster the highest standards of music appreciation, interest, and participation on the campus and in the community. A number of the outstanding musicians in the nation are members of this organization. The Gamma Kappa chapter here at Davidson will elect new members from the upper classes in both the fall and the spring.

Publications Announce Business Managers

The purpose of this article is to introduce you to the Business Managers of the three student publications: the Davidsonian, Quips 'n Cranks, and Scripts 'n Pranks. The appointment of these men last spring was not published, so some of the upperclassmen, along with the freshmen, do not know who holds these offices.

John McNair, of Laurinburg, N.C., is the Business Manager of the Davidsonian. John was originally in the class of '48, but the war interrupted his college studies. During the war, he served two years in the Navy. He is a member of Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity and is its president this year. In the past, he has also held offices as vice-president and secretary.

Bill Medford, calling Lancaster, S.C., home, is Business Manager of Scripts 'n Pranks. Bill is a member of Pi Kappa Phi fraternity and has served on the annual staff as assistant business manager.

Bill Lander, of Quips 'n Cranks, is from Charlotte, N.C. He is a member of the ROTC unit and is the Battalion Commander at Davidson. Coming to Davidson as a transfer student from Carolina, he has directed his course of study towards a major in business.

Queens Dance

One hundred freshmen started their Davidson social life off with a bang when they made the mad dash to Queens College on Saturday night. Rushing into the haughty grandeur of Burwell Hall with rat caps in hand and hearts in throat, the freshmen met, not the lovely girls of their various and sundry dreams, but the awesome countenance of Judge Cone Bingham. The judge, as usual, soon put the freshmen right and got them squared away with the lovelies of Queens.

Then the dance started to the music of the juke box and things were keeping abreast of the times. The juke box, always alert, kept buzzing as the ever-alert Warren Gingham kept the stag line on the move. From his observation tower, the judge kept the freshmen deeper into the dance.

The drum majors of the band, Davis Hamm and Bob Walker, will lead the band in some fine formations which have been recently arranged. These formations are an anchor, a battleship, a "D", a wolf's head, and a map of North Carolina. The band will represent Navy at the Duke-Navy game in Durham on Saturday afternoon, November 7, which includes the annual Homecoming celebration and the Richmond football game on Saturday. The band will depart for Durham on Friday night and will appear at least twice during the Convocation.

Pat Clark Named ROTC Commander

Volumes of Kinsey's report were first purchased by the college for the biology department. They were bought by students, fourteen were rented to them on a semester basis, and the remaining three have been retained by the school for use in decorating proposed clubrooms. The library, always keeping abreast of the times, bought more so the supply would meet the demand.Rooms on the first floors of Scripps and Franks will include Miss Swarthout and Bill, who should stop being a freshman adviser. Suddy will be there for a year and a half. He is in Clarkton, N.C. The summer vice-president is Charlie Hadley, of Phi and Eu halls. He graduated last year, but with Cheek’s shoulders, he was able to carry the load. The annual alumni Homecoming meeting of 1947 found Pat taking his required training at the ROTC camp in Fort Benning, Georgia. Recently, he has been tapped for membership in Scabbard & Blade. An active membership in Sigma Phi Epsilon Fraternity, plus an interest in various intramural sports, round out Pat's extracurricular activities on campus.

Clark began his Army career as just another “Joe,” taking Infantry Basic. Upon its completion, he was sent to Ohio for Ordnance training. Then he was loaded on a ship which took him to various battle fronts in England, France, Belgium, Holland, Germany, and Austria. At the rank of sergeant, he received his discharge in March '46, holding the ETO, American Theater Service Medal, EAME Service Medal with 3 bronze stars, good conduct ribbon, and the World War II Victory Medal. While in Europe, he was able to obtain enough furlough time to spend a few days on the French Riviera and to travel through Switzerland. He rooms in East Dormitory with ‘The Dude,’ Bud Edwards, and pious Dave Miller, who inform me that Mr. Clark is earnestly doing his part to appease the strained relations with Queens College.

**WEATHER REPORT**

The weather forecast for Davidson and vicinity for the weekend: The weather will be clear, partly cloudy, and rather cool on Friday and Saturday. Slightly rising temperatures on Saturday afternoon and on Sunday. Low temperature expected Saturday morning, 45 to 48 degrees. The temperature Saturday night during the game, 55 to 60 degrees, and the high expected on Sunday afternoon, 69 to 73 degrees.

It has been reported that a large group of freshmen descended on the corner. Incidentally, this is the intersection of the main street where the Post Office is located. They cut in front of several upperclassmen who had been waiting for a ride and all congregated on the corner. This large crowd right on the highway generally fouled up things for all concerned. No motorist is going to stop for a crowd of ten or more boys surging around the corner. Other reports of freshmen going up the road and bumming around the Carolina Inn at Copeland's also violate the tradition. The rule is that all newcomers on the corner should stand well back on the sidewalk and wait for the group on the corner to catch the first ride before the second group starts bumming. If a student doesn't want to wait on the corner, he should go down the street towards Hugo's and bum there. No one ever goes up the street! Judge Bingham stated that if the situation was not relieved, he would take action against all freshman violators, and if this did no good, he would take drastic steps against the freshman class as a whole to uphold this useful and necessary tradition.

**BEAT STATE**

Since 1946, Mr. Charles F. Gillette, landscape architect of Richmond, Virginia, has been employed by the College to draft plans for the development and beautification of the campus, and as most everybody has noticed, some of the landscaping has already been accomplished. One of the first projects undertaken was the area on the north side of Chambers to Richardson Field. Fifty trees were planted and grass was sown in part of this area during the past summer. Also, some of the shrubbery surrounding Chambers, being too large in proportion to the size of the building, was transplanted to other sites on the campus. These things, plus the removal of three old buildings, complete the work done on the campus thus far. However, during Mr. Gillette’s recent visit to the college, he outlined to the administration more extensive projects, which, it is hoped, will get underway in the near future. Perhaps the subject of more derogatory comments than anything else concerning the campus at the present time is the inconvenience of the present system of walks, or even worse, the lack of walks elsewhere throughout the campus. As a result, one of the first things included in Mr. Gillette’s plans to be undertaken in the next few months will be the building of a more serviceable and convenient system of walks. These will include a network of walks between Dormitory Row and Chambers, a walk extending west from the south corner of Chambers to Main Street, a walk extending east from the north end of Chambers to Richardson Field, and a walk extending from Dormitory Row to the Fraternity Court. Another thing, which it is hoped will be done very soon, is the asphalt surfacing of the roads around the gym, the dormitories, and the Fraternity Court. Most of this work was supposed to have been done this past summer, but because the contractor has been delayed in another city, these projects have had to be postponed for a short time. The details mentioned above are only a part of Mr. Gillette's long-range plan for the beautification of our campus. But they will give you some notion of what he is planning to have done. The blueprint calls for many more radical changes of roads and walks, and more extensive landscaping. Let's hope that it won't be too long until we can say with assurance and pride that we have one of the most beautiful college campuses in the South.

**Will Address IRC**

The International Relations Club will hold its second regular meeting of the year next Monday evening at 7:30 PM in the basement of the Science Hall. The guest speaker will be Dr. J. R. Cunningham, who represented the Southern Presbyterian Church at the recent Amsterdam Conference. While in Europe, he observed firsthand the conditions that now endure on that unhappy continent and its people. Dr. Cunningham will speak for a short period on his experiences and observations, and then a discussion period will follow in which all those attending the meeting are invited to take part. IRC President Jack Eldridge is confident that the program will be interesting and informative for all present. The Club hopes to continue throughout the year with such programs and urges its members to keep pace with world developments. An excellent medium for this is the United Nations Newsletter, which can be subscribed to for only twenty-five cents a year. The IRC strongly recommends that not only its members but all students take advantage of this publication. Davidsonian representatives John Loftin and Bob Houston have already begun making a canvas of the dorms to find out who wishes to take advantage of this offer. By the end of the week, they hope to have the canvas completed. Be on the ball and have your subscription ready when they come around. If, for some reason or other, you have not been contacted, drop by 203 East and give John your subscription. The manager of the circulation department is Bill Houck.

**Homecoming**

The Homecoming game with the University of Richmond will be played on Richardson Field with spectacular half-time entertainment and demonstrations by the visiting band. On Sunday evening, a special mass meeting and stadium service in the interest of Christian Education will bring the observances to a close. Dr. James T. Cleland, Duke University Divinity School professor and university minister, will be the speaker. Mass choirs from several churches will merge with the Davidson Male Chorus and visiting musicians to provide an inspiring service. Richardson Stadium will be the venue for the recognition of Presbyterian ministers and representatives of all congregations having members as students at Davidson College. The cornerstone Convocation promises to be Davidson's most significant occasion, vying in size and importance with the Centennial Celebration held in 1937.
