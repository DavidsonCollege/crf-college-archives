MRS. JAMES SPRUNT.

It is with very deep regret that the faculty and students of Davidson College learn of the death of Mrs. James Sprunt, of Wilmington. Mrs. Sprunt’s life abounded in charity and good work. The one distinguishing trait of her fine Christian character was her utter disregard of self in her beautiful devotion to others. She was for eight years president of the “North Carolina Society of the Colonial Dames of America,” and was at her death its honorary president. Mrs. Sprunt died at her home in Wilmington, on Thursday. The funeral services were conducted at her home on South Front St., Friday afternoon, Rev. J. M. Wells, D.D., pastor of the First Presbyterian church, officiating, assisted by Rev. Dr. Alexander Sprunt, of Charleston, S. C. Mrs. Sprunt is survived by her husband and one son, Mr. J. L. Sprunt; a little grandson, J. L. Sprunt, Jr.; a brother, Mr. Kenneth Murchenson, a distinguished architect of New York; and three sisters: Mrs. Frank Ellis, of Atlanta, Ga.; Mrs. Shirley Carter, of Baltimore, and Mrs. C. H. Hurkamp, of Fredericksburg, Va.

CHANGE IN ARRANGEMENTS.

A change which should be noted is that the doors of Shearer Hall will not open between the speeches, but will open while the orchestra is playing, between every three speeches. Persons should be guided accordingly in attending these exercises.

SLIGHT EARTHQUAKE FELT IN DAVIDSON

On Monday night at about 6:45 a distinct but not severe earthquake shock was felt in Davidson. Many buildings in the town were shaken very noticeably but the movement was too slight to cause any damage. It lasted for about 10 or 15 seconds.

RED AND BLACK QUINT (Continued from page 1)

Carolina Johnson played a good game at forward. Davidson will meet the University of North Carolina in a return game Friday at Statesville, and with the week's rest they will have had, they expect to give the Tar Heels a hard tussle. The line-up:

GREENSBORO GAME.

Thursday night Davidson met the Greensboro Y. M. C. A. in the final game of their trip, which they won, 32 to 25. The game was very fast and cleanly played, very few fouls being called. Davidson held the lead throughout with little danger. Hengeveld was all over the floor and played a fine game. He shot 7 field goals, contributing the major portion of Davidson's score. For Greensboro, King and Wood also played well. Beecher and Lewis were the stars. The line-up:

Davidson, Position, Greensboro Y.
King......... Forward ...... 
Wood........ Forward .... Patterson
Hengeveld.... Centre....... Lewis
Reese (c)..... Guard ...... Beecher
Walker....... Guard....... Marrs

Substitutions: Younger for Walker, McAlister for Wood, Kellenberger for Patterson. Field Goals: Hengeveld 7, Beecher 5, King 4, Lewis 3, Wood 2, Reese 2, Jones, Marrs, Kellenberger. Foul Goals: Jones 3, Reese 2.

STATESVILLE GAME.

In a slow and rather uninteresting game, Davidson Saturday defeated Statesville Y. M. C. A. by the lop-sided score of 48 to 17. The game was replete with frequent fouling on the part of Davidson, and besides this, Statesville rarely got a chance to score. Reese and Walker played airtight games at guards and allowed few shots to get past them. The Iredell quint seemed unable to get up steam, and the lightningFloor work and passing of the Presbyterians kept the ball in their possession for fully three-fourths of the time. King, at forward, was the particular star for Davidson, though no man should be overlooked in picking the luminaries of the game. Besides scoring over half of Davidson's points, King held the locals’ teamwork together. He seemed to be everywhere at once, and often plucked the ball from the very hands of his huskier opponents and tossed a basket. Reese and Hengeveld also played good games. For Statesville, Guy and Newman were the mainstays, though Etheridge also did good work in holding the team together. Guy’s work deserves particular mention, however, for its scrappiness and ginger. This is the fourth of a scheduled five-game series between the two teams, and the count now stands 3 to 1 in favor of the Red and Black. The date of the fifth game has not been definitely announced as yet.

The line-up:
Davidson. Position. Statesville
Y. King......... Forward .. 0.2... Guy
Wood........ Forward .... Newman
Hengeveld. ....Centre . . Etheridge (c)
Reese (c)......Guard 2.0.2... Brady
Walker....... Guard ..... Overcash

Substitutions: Younger for Wood, McAlister for Younger, Younger for Walker, Carson for Younger, Nimocks for Carson. Field Goals: King 13, Hengeveld 4, Newman 4, Reese 3, Wood 2, Brady. Foul Goals: Guy 7, Reese 2. Referee: Booe. Time of halves: 20 minutes.

CHARLOTTE GAME
In a slow and unexciting game, Davidson went down to defeat Monday night before the Charlotte quintet on their home floor. Davidson began the scoring with a rush, and soon had the score decidedly one-sided, but Charlotte located the iron circle and took the lead early in the game. The first half ended 14-10. Davidson very plainly missed Hengeveld at center, who was out with a wrenched back. In the second half, Davidson was closely guarded and had few chances to score, while her numerous fouls gave as many points to her opponents. Final score, 28-19. Reese starred for Davidson, and for Charlotte, McDonald, Howell, and Davenport played the leading roles. The game was characterized by personal fouls and football tactics.

The line-up:
Charlotte. Position. Davidson.
Davenport.....Forward ..... Wood
McDonald.... Forward... .... King
Howell....... Center ...... Younger
Crook........ Guard ........ Reese
Corbett....... Guard...... Walker

Field Goals: Davenport 3, McDonald 2, Howell 4, Corbett, Reese 3, King 2, Wood. Foul Goals: McDonald 8 out of 12, Reese 7 out of 10. Referee: Fowle, Charlotte.
