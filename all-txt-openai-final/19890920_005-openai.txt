The Davidsonian Wednesday, September 20, 1988

“The students’ major precept was nonviolence,” said English professor Gill Holland, who was teaching with his wife in China during
the demonstrations.

**China’s turmoil forces Holland to cut visit short**

By JESSICA THURBEE

What is it like to live in a society where you have no choice of a career? What is it
like to live in a society where you are not allowed to speak your mind for fear of punishment? What
is it like to live in a society where nepotism runs rampant and government corruption is the norm? Welcome to
China.

Professor of English Gill Holland and his wife Siri got the chance to see the effects of this type of
society firsthand when in mid-February of this year they left for China to teach English, literature, and writing to students
at the Beijing Normal University. They returned earlier than planned due to the violence and unrest in the city.

According to Holland, the most interesting or exciting experience he had were the demonstrations, but the visit as a whole
was exciting. In streets, Holland mentioned that he was the guest of honor at a party where a whole turtle
was served. It was brought in floating, head, legs, and tail. As the guest of honor, Holland got to gnaw
on the shell of the turtle.

At the beginning of his trip, things were quiet, said Holland, but the unrest began on April 15 when the
students’ hero, Hu Yao Bang, died. Holland emphasized the fact that the students and the people of China were courteous
and kind to him. “The students’ major precept was nonviolence,” he said, adding that the students had no desire to
hurt anyone. Their main goal was the instigation of a public forum to discuss government corruption and nepotism, he maintained.
The atmosphere was one of high drama and excitement, but also of idealism and optimism.

**Campus Pub replaces Peregrine’s**

By PETER BYNUM

Shawn Merrithew didn’t act like a man who was two hours away from the grand opening of a brand new
business. As he showed me around his new investment last Thursday—The Campus Pub—I quickly began to get a feel for
the atmosphere that he was trying to create. It was not a forced feeling, but a natural, relaxed confidence that
reflected the attitude of the owner. It came from the pictures of Davidson athletes that graced the walls. It sprang
from the jerseys of each house on Patterson Court that hung beside a photograph of its membership. It was felt
in the spirit of the Davidson students helping with final preparations. Shawn Merrithew had no reason to be nervous. “The
Campus Pub” will have no problem fitting into the Davidson lifestyle.

The type of atmosphere that I felt is exactly the image that Merrithew seeks for his pub. He plans to
gear the establishment toward the needs and desires of the college community and is willing to constantly keep an ear
to the ground to stay in touch with the students. “I'll change my specials every night if my customers want
me to,” said Merrithew. “We'll remain really flexible in everything we do.”

And there seems to be a lot that Merrithew plans to do. Professional football will naturally play a big part
in the life of the bar, with free food offered on Sunday afternoons and pitcher specials on Monday nights. But
The Campus Pub is for students, and naturally Davidson athletics will receive a great deal of emphasis. Merrithew has already

**College bowl’s back**

Last year the College Bowl team finished a surprising third in the regional tournament. This exemplifies the resurgence of Davidson
in college bowl competition. The current team wants to emulate the success of the 1979 national champion team.

The college bowl competes in several tournaments throughout the year, including regionals, the first step to the national championship. Our
region is the largest and toughest in the country, but the team regularly beats schools that defeat us in other
sports. Duke, Clemson, South Carolina, and Memphis State all fall to Davidson.

Doug Gibson, Joe Louderback, Steve Libby, and Gates Grainger start on the team, and Arjun Srinivasan is an alternate. The
team lost one member from last year’s group, John Hutchinson, to graduation. The intensity of the team has already manifested
itself at practice this year. The University of Virginia eventually won regionals last year, an upsetting fact to some team
members. Louderback said, “My brother goes to UVA, we can’t let them win again.”

College bowl is a game

See BOWL, page 7Established a close relationship with our varsity football team, offering to provide a free dinner each week
and to present Player of the Week awards. Action photos of athletes from all sports will hang on the walls
of the pub. A sports theme will not dominate the bar, for Merrithew’s goal is to appeal to the entire
student body. A small stage with an open microphone sits in one corner, a perfect setting for guitar musicians or
solo performers. Occasionally, Merrithew may invite a Charlotte band or let a student group take the stage. He seems quite
open to students’ suggestions and the possibilities for entertainment at The Campus Pub remain very flexible.

The idea for the pub sprang from a need that Merrithew sensed himself. As a divorced single living in Davidson,
he was painfully aware of the lack of social opportunities in town. He thought a casual pub near campus would
liven things up considerably.

When the owner of Peregrine House, Bob Johnson, put his restaurant on the market, Merrithew began to consider turning the
place into a pub. The college looked into the property for office space as did at least one other individual
investor. Both of these deals fell through, clearing the way for Merrithew’s offer. Johnson accepted and he remains a silent
partner in the enterprise.

“I was waiting for someone else to do it,” claimed Merrithew, “but nobody did. So I did it myself.”

As with any new business, The Campus Pub is forcing some tough decisions on its owner. Merrithew is currently employed
as a manager for the college’s catering service. Carleton Pritchard, Director of Auxiliary Services, has voiced some concern that Merrithew
may find himself in a conflict of interest due to his new investment. Merrithew contends that this won’t be a
problem, but also feels a duty to choose whether to continue work with the college or to devote his time
to The Campus Pub. He expects to make a decision soon after opening night. Judging on the first night of
business, he will do what he thinks “feels right.”

There is little doubt in my mind that the Davidson community will soon know that The Campus Pub “feels right.”
As I walked out the door that Thursday afternoon I was struck with the thought that Merrithew’s place was more
than a new business on Depot Street. The Campus Pub could easily become a Davidson tradition.

... and most of all patriotism, he said. The students were not trying to overthrow the government, but to make
it more responsible. Students’ original plan, he said, was to stay in the square until the Communist Party meeting on
June 20th. The most shocking event was the arrival of the People’s Army, said Holland. This was the “people’s” army,
and he said that the Chinese felt that the army would never hurt them. Unfortunately, the majority of the Chinese
were wrong.

When asked if he anticipated such a violent outcome, Holland replied, “No, but there was fear in the air.” He
went on to say that he fervently disagrees with people who say that the students could have prevented the events.
He feels that these critics are “wrong-headed” and mistaken. The students’ demands were far from extravagant, said Holland. They wanted
a public discussion of government corruption and a reversal of an editorial in the April 26th issue of The People’s
Daily (Beijing’s daily newspaper) which had accused the students of unpatriotic behavior. Most of all, however, the students did not
want a cover-up, he added. They realized that they were taking a big risk and would be forced to pay
a price. Unfortunately, they had no idea the price would be so high.

Secondly, Holland feels that the government is to blame. He feels that their ineptitude and callousness caused the people's dissatisfaction.
Had the government been willing to listen to the students’ demands seriously, the outcome would not have been so violent,
he said. Another problem in the government was the fact that it was not speaking with one voice. There were
several factions in the government, each vying for power. Now, however, as Holland put it, “The government speaks with one
big lying voice.”

When asked if he thought that anything would come of the demonstrations, Holland replied, “We all hoped that they would
succeed.” He felt that the possibility was there, because before they arrived “terrific” events had already occurred. Criticisms of the
government were written, signed, and published in newspapers. The outlook was promising for change, but it appears as if the
government was not prepared to go very far, added Holland.

Holland said that everyone...
