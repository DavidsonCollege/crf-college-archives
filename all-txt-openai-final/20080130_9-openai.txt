THE DAVIDSONIAN

“Stepping out of a terminal in a new city on a weekly basis really is as glamorous as it sounds. I have crossed air traffic paths and train tracks all over Europe, from London to Istanbul, but my faithful home remains Geneva, Switzerland. Though guidebooks may recommend this city for a day trip, cosmopolitan and eclectic Geneva is my new campus and new home.”

“Everyone was eager simply because they had never met anyone like me before. The only impressions they had of foreigners were based on stereotypes, if that. At that moment, I saw that I had to let go of my own insecurities. I started to understand that the whole point of this experience was to get to know people, to share a laugh, to be myself.”

“Some of my fondest memories are simply talking with locals while sipping oolong or green tea, chatting with garrulous cab drivers and dancing traditional dances with children. One of my favorite activities in China is to go to a park on a Sunday morning and watch countless groups of people sing, dance, paint and play musical instruments. Their minds might be focused on the future economic development of China, but their hearts still hold true to the past.”

“The flight attendants stopped making their announcements in English and instead used only Turkish. As we approached Istanbul, all I could see across the horizon was the silhouettes of minarets. I realized then how different my four months abroad would be from my semesters at Davidson.”

“[My travel companions and I] woke up early the next morning and drove another two hours to the Twelve Apostles: huge rocks jutting out of the ocean. These inspiring rocks are sentinels along the Australian coast—slowly and inevitably being reclaimed by the sea. After the four-hour drive back to Melbourne, I found myself agreeing with Carl when he said that he felt as if we all had been friends for a long time.”
