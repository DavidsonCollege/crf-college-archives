**CAT-TALES By TONI CASALI | WEDNESDAY, NOV. 16, 1938**

Paul Shu certainly lived up to advance dope last Saturday against Davidson's “never-say-quits” Wildcats. He is probably the most outstanding
back to perform on Richardson Field this season and if he has played in all the other games on the
V. M. I. schedule as he did against our ‘Cats, he undoubtedly will run off with All-Southern honors again this
year. Shu was the difference between the two teams—without him, V. M. I. would have had a hard time beating
Davidson. They would have had a tough time scoring the three touchdowns—he scored all three and the thing about it
was that he set all three of them up. V. M. I.’s first score came soon after the kick-off, following
Davidson's lone marker. Shu carried the ball seven straight times from the 45-yard stripe. Three of these times he made
better than ten yards. Then after he scored, Davidson received the kick-off deep in 'Cat territory. Davis kicked to the
50-yard line, where the ball began bounding and bounced to the V. M. I. 48, where Shu scooped it up
and skirted 62 yards to score. It was a beautiful run, excelling anything that has been seen on the 'Cat
field to date. Not satisfied with these two quick scores, he took a pass from Trzeciak late in the final
quarter to end the scoring for the day. Now if that performance isn’t worthy of some mention on all-star teams,
there never was one. Of course, while you were busily watching the shining Shu, Andy Trzeciak, the Cadet captain and
fullback, was probably overlooked. He played a fine game—60 minutes in all—and much credit is due him. V. M. I.
presented the best all-around backfield that the ’Cats have faced this year. All four of the starting backs were triple-threats
and could pass, punt, run, and block with the best of them.

Davidson has one game left on the 1938 schedule—the annual Turkey Day clash with Wake Forest’s Demon Deacons. There probably
isn’t an upperclassman around who has forgotten last year’s game and Davidson is out for revenge. Wake Forest, however, with
its flaming sophs led by Tony Gallovich and Red Mayberry, is strongest in years. They have risen to heights against
Duke and Carolina. They beat South Carolina, the team that tied Villanova who beat Auburn, 25-12. Yes, it looks bad
for the ’Cats. Wake Forest, a few years back, held a jinx over the 'Cats. Recently that jinx has been
broken and we don’t want to see it started again. The thing about this game is that Davidson would rather
lick the Deacs than any other ten teams, including Duke and Carolina. If Davidson licks them they can say that
they have had a successful season. Coach McEver will be giving his squad some tough workouts in preparation for those
Deacs and before the game is over there will be plenty of football exhibited. The former Tennessee All-American will use
every trick available against the Deacs and if the 'Cats are right—watch out Wake Forest.

Well, the 1938 season is almost at a close and already the question of what kind of prospects Davidson will
have for next year has come up. Right now things look pretty good with plenty of material coming up from
the B team and more from the frosh eleven. This year’s frosh eleven is undoubtedly the best in recent years.
There are fine running backs on hand. Spencer, Hackney, and Simonds can carry the mail pretty fair for first-year men
and also do a good job kicking and passing. Big Stan Yoder, with his 185 pounds, should give somebody a
merry race for one of the back positions. He can take punishment and can block and “back up the line”
as well. Don Bell and Elmer Knoeller, both of whom tip the scales better than the 190-pound mark, have shown
excellent abilities at their tackle posts. Then in the line, with some experience behind these two rugged boys, they will
“go places.” Frank Caldwell is the heaviest center to play on a frosh team in many a year and will
come in handy as will George Marsh, who has been playing a neat game at guard so far this season.

Varsity basketball practice is now in full swing and from all indications Davidson will have a winning team this year.
They will give Southern Conference teams plenty of trouble before the season finishes as the ’Cats have more returning lettermen
than any other school in the circle. Four of last year’s starting quint will return. J. D. Hicks, Ned Iverson,
and Footsie Cowan, all six-footers, should be in for their best season. Johnny Tice, smallest collegiate basketball player in the
country and the fourth starter of last year’s quint, will also be heard from plenty. The race for the other
starting positions will be between Bill Boyd, a smooth ball handler, Swede Johnston, Benny Harrison, and Jim Thomas, who all
saw plenty of service last year. It looks like there will be plenty of reserve strength on hand, too. Several
members of last year’s fine frosh quint are groomed to see action, along with some of the reserves from last
year’s varsity. Some of the boys who are out are: Jim Hogg, Apie Means, George Ficklen, Tommy Glenn, Bob Phipps,
Winston Taylor, and Bobby Williams. Maybe if a B team could be made up of some of these boys so
that they might get some experience, they would come in handy in future seasons.

Interfraternity football season is drawing to a close with several teams still fighting it out for first place honors. The
Kappa Sigs lead the pack with no defeats chalked up against them to date. These games are among the most
popular on the campus today and the proverbial bunch of posies should be given to Pete Whittle for the fine
way in which he has conducted his intramural program.

P. S. I request someone—ANYBODY—to write this column next week.

**Kappa Sigs Take Close Game To Capture Lead**

**Phi Gams Topple Phi Delts to Leave Kappa Sigs Only Unbeaten Team**

Close games featured the intrafraternity touch football league last week, and at the same time the Kappa Sigs took a
definite lead in the race when the Phi Gams dropped the Phi Delts off of the undefeated list, and by
beating the Sig Eps. The Phi Gam-Phi Delt struggle was the feature game of the week with the Phi Gams
winning by the margin of one first down scored in the last play of the game. The game was hard
fought all of the way with both defenses shining, but the Phi Gams proved their superiority by connecting with passes
to score two first downs in the last minute of play. The Kappa Sigs came through on Monday to defeat
the Sig Eps three first downs to two. This defeat practically dropped the Sig Eps out of the race for
the crown, and at the same time kept the Kappa Sigs on top with six wins and no defeats.

**THE HIGH SCORE OF LAST WEEK**

**Was Set By Bill Marquess - 161**

**PITCH-PATCH**

**M. H. Goodrum Bowling Alleys**

**Davidson, N. C.**

**Going Good**

Gales McClintock, game little 155-pound reserve end, played a heady game against V.M.I. Saturday as he hauled a punt back
and caught a pass for a good gain to aid materially the ’Cats’ touchdown drive.

**Kittens Meet Terrier Pups**

On Thursday afternoon the Davidson Freshmen will travel to Spartanburg to engage the Wofford Freshmen in the final game of
the current season. The Wildkittens will be hampered by the loss of several first-string men on account of scholastic difficulties,
injuries, and Claude Hackney, one of the Kits’ ace backs, will still be out on the sidelines with a knee
injury. Other minor injuries will hinder the smooth running of their attack. The Terrier Pups have come out of their
annual battle with the Wildkittens victorious for several years, but comparative scores show that the Davidson Frosh have a good
chance to break this winning streak in this year’s contest. Last year the Wofford Freshmen came from behind in the
last five minutes of the game to score two touchdowns and lick the Kittens. The Wildkittens have won four games
thus far this season, and they have lost only to the powerful Duke Freshman team, which is the best Freshman
team in the state.

**Beesters Win Second Game**

Davidson's Battling Beesters rose to offensive heights Friday as they met and defeated the Bulldogs of Lees-McRae Junior College, 32-0,
in a prelude to Saturday's Homecoming battle. Executing North Carolina's famous double reverses to perfection and mixing them with line
bucks and passes, the powerful Beesters scored five times and added two extra points to swamp one of the best
Junior College outfits in the Carolina loop. Sharpe, Bolin, Plonk, and Winters were the main ground gainers for the Wildcat
Reserves, with diminutive “Black Dog” Hunter doing the ball-handling and passing capably. Jay Bolin, 175-pound line plunger, scored three times
to run his touchdown total to six scores in the last two games. In the Beester line, Hicks and John
King were outstanding, while the entire forward wall opened wide holes in the Bulldog line and presented a defense through
which the opposing backs were able to gain little. Hicks particularly shone as a pass receiver, on one occasion catching
a 20-yard pass from Sharpe and running 40 yards to score.

**Duke To Face Final Test In Next Conflict**

Duke will face its final test for Big Five and Southern Conference honors Saturday afternoon.When she engages N. C. State's
Wolfpack in Duke Stadium, the Blue Devils have rolled over all other competition this season not only by beating them,
but also by allowing none of them to cross her goal. Not even the strong Georgia Tech team, which outplayed
but tied Alabama Saturday, could lick the Devils. Nor could the potent Tar Heels, who also played to a tie
last Saturday with Fordham, score on them. However, it is characteristic of all the Wolfpack elevens to play their best
game with Duke.

Carolina, sore and battered from the Fordham tilt, will take it easy for a few days and then settle down
to hard work for their annual Thanksgiving game with the University of Virginia. In recent years the Tar Heels have
had the edge in wins, but the Cavaliers have partly come out of their slump this year, and this game
promises to be colorful in tradition and action.

Wake Forest and Davidson are also preparing for their Turkey Day classic. Davidson did not practice on Monday, thereby easing
slightly the tension of a hard ten-game schedule. Bill Beaty, the only injured man on the squad, will be in
uniform and will probably be ready for action for the Deacon game. Horace McCall was injured in the M. I.
game but the injury is not expected to hinder his playing.

Cat Harriers Are Defeated
Guilford’s Varsity cross-country team barely eked out a win Saturday morning over the Davidson Harriers by a 27-28 verdict. Captain
Al Meibohn of Guilford was successful in winning over Walker and Woodward of Davidson for the second time this year
to climax a three-year rivalry between them. Woodward and Walker tied for second behind the Guilford captain. Bob Kellog of
Davidson finished fourth and Davidson placed five men in ninth and tenth respectively. The Cats were weakened by the continued
loss of Gammon and Telford through injuries.

Frosh Meet Lees-McRae
Davidson walked off with honors in the triangular meet between Davidson, Lees-McRae, and Greensboro High School. The Davidson frosh placed
three men in one, two, and three, followed by Watt and Garrou of Davidson. Lees-McRae finished third with 68. Greensboro
was next with 43. The Lees-McRae boys kept their record of never losing to a Wildcat team in cross-country.

Many a man would have kept out of hot water had he stuck closer to cold water.

[Continued on Page Six]

Davidson blocked two Wake punts at crucial times and tackled viciously, causing frequent fumbles by the Wake Forest backs. Their
smashing line consistently wrecked the Deacon plays before they could get started. Davidson should have every man in uniform for
the Turkey Day tilt and is expected to throw a new repertoire of plays at the Deacon sophs. Both teams
have been scouted by enemy spotters and it will be interesting to note whether the defenses set up by the
two teams prove adequate to stop their respective offenses.

Wild Cats Gain Lead as Cowan Scores in Second Period; Shu Leads Single-Handed Attack That Nets Three Touchdowns

After outplaying the V. M. I Flying Squadron during the first quarter and part of the second, the Davidson Wildcats
fell before the onslaught of their heavier rivals as Paul Shu, high-scoring triple-threat back, paced his team to a 19-6
win before a Homecoming crowd of 4,000 at Field Saturday. Coach Richardson McEver's charges threw a scare into their favored
opponents early in the second quarter as Bill Davis climaxed a scoring march by tossing a pass to lanky Jim
Cowan who received it on the six and trotted over the double stripes. V. M. I. struck back twice, however,
in the same quarter to place the Cadets seven points ahead at the intermission period.

After an exchange of punts, the Squadron took the ball on their own thirty-four and with Halfback Shu leading the
drive, scored on the eighth play. After receiving the kick-off, Davidson was forced to punt from their own territory. Shu,
receiving the kick, galloped across the field to the sidelines, where he wended his way through the entire Cat team
to score standing up for his second touchdown of the day. In the final period, Shu took a pass from
Treziak over the goal for the final score of the game.

After the initial period, the Davidson attack never functioned well, except for brief flashes, while the Brother Rats toured pay
dirt territory several times. Captain Dave Warden, Bill Johnston, and Ned Iverson led the playing of the forward wall, with
Bill Davis pacing the Wildcat attack.

Basketball
Varsity basketball practice opened last Monday night with about 20 men reporting to Coach Norman Shepard for equipment. The candidates
have settled down to hard work in preparation for the coming season, which opens in December. Last week's practice sessions
consisted mainly of shooting and passing drills, in which handling of the ball was the main purpose. Several football men
have not reported as yet, but they are expected to join soon.

YOU fellows whose habit it is to break for Charlotte on Saturday afternoons have an unbeatable idea; no chap can
work all the time if he’s hitched to a dynamo and can’t find the switch. Maybe that’s why they built
Charlotte so close to Davidson; we like to think it is, anyway. And now, with winter at the door and
everybody developing outsize appetites, it seems an appropriate time to remind you that any Saturday night may quite-appropriately be referred
to as “Davidson Night” in this place; we wouldn’t quite know how to operate otherwise!

Davidson Beat By Powerful Cadets As Paul Shu Shines 19-6

Stair Is Best Ground Gainer
Fred Stair led the parade of Davidson backs in the V. M. I. game Saturday, with an eight-yard average for
four tries. Hand and McClellan were next in line with three yards each. Davidson equaled V. M. I.’s first downs
with nine apiece, but fell short on net yards gained rushing as the Flying Squadron racked up 165 to the
Cats’ 101. The Wildcats’ passing average was better than their opponents’, however, as they completed four out of six tries,
while the Cadets were only able to connect once out of fifteen. Bill Davis completed all the passes that made
61 yards, while the Brother Rats made four for 20. As usual, Davis outbooted his rival kickers by punting ten
times for a 38-yard average, which brought the total Davidson average to a bit over 37, as compared with 36
for the Virginians. With much punting on both sides, Davidson kicked eleven times, while the Keydets booted the ball twelve
times.
