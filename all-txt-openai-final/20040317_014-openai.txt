DMR earns all-conference
honors at indoor champs

By Austin MERCADANTE
Staff Writer

While most students were packing bags and
leaving for spring break in an exotic city, the
men and women of the track team made the long
journey to Johnson City, Tennessee. That exotic
locale was the host of the Indoor Southern
Conference Championships, held on Feb. 28 and
29, the culmination of a long and cold indoor
season. The meet gave Davidson runners the
opportunity to showcase the fruits of their labors.

The women’s 3,000-meter race was the first
to be run, and Carissa Skrivanek ’06 was the
lone Davidson representative. Skrivanek
dropped the competition like a bad habit en
route to winning her heat by six seconds in a
personal best time of 10:56.39. Her time
placed her in 12th overall in the 3,000.

The men’s 3,000 run featured a combination
of long-distance and middle-distance runners
for Davidson. All four Wildcats (Austin
Mercadante ’06, Ben Gaspar ’04, Dave Bunge
’04, John Doehring ’07) finished within eight
seconds of each other, taking 13th through
16th place.

During qualifying heats in the 400, David
Ritchie ’07 again set a school record with his
time of 50.68 seconds. Chris Rouisse ’04 also
ran a top-ten performance with a 52.32 in his
heat.

Davidson runners in the 800 all ran excep-
tionally well, as two set personal bests and
one qualified for the final. Andrew Hazen ’07
ran a 2:01.51, and Rob Whited ran 1:59.47,
personal bests for both. Douglass Noreen ’07
qualified for the finals with a 1:57.74 but was
unable to run because of an overnight illness.

The best time for the women’s 800 runners
was 2:25.34, run by Ashley Griffith ’05 in her
qualifying heat.

The mile was the only event where a
Davidson runner scored individual points.
Nick Lehmen ’05 ran a 4:22.67, landing him
in 8th place. Lehmen was followed closely by
Greg Scott ’04 in 4:25.21.

In the 5000-meter dash, Jonathan Baker ’06
crossed the finish line first for the Wildcats in
a personal best time of 15:38.96. Baker ended
up in 13th place in the race. Laura Puckett
’04 was the lone entrant for the women, and
she finished in 19:06.20, good for 14th place.

The relays were the races in which Davidson
scored the most points. The men’s DMR set
another school record with a time of 10:14.82.
Scott ran the opening 1200-meter leg and
handed the baton and the lead to Ritchie.
Ritchie ran a blazing fast 400-meter leg, faster
than his earlier 400-meter qualifying race,
passing the baton to Noreen. Noreen fought
off several competitors’ surges in his 800-
meter leg before passing the baton to Matt
Rhodes ’07.

Rhodes ran an evenly paced 1600-meter leg,
kicking past a competitor in the stretch to cross
the line in third place. The third-place finish
garnered All-Conference honors for the DMR
squad.

The women’s DMR finished in 6th place
with a time of 12:55.98. Griffith ran the 1200-
meter leg, Kate Wilson ’04 the 400, Hilary
Leister ’06 the 800, and Allie Martin ’06 the
1600.

The team opened the outdoor season last
Saturday and will compete again this week-
end in the UNC Charlotte 49er classic in Char-
lotte.
