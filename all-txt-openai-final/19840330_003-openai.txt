**Sloan Symposium Addresses Electrical Rates**

By DAVID VAN PELT

“The problem is not a small one; it’s an important one,” said philosophy Professor Earl MacCormac last Thursday about deciding
electric utility rates. MacCormac’s speech, entitled “Background of Problems in Values and Electrical Ratemaking,” was part of a Sloan Liberal
Arts Symposium, held last Thursday and Friday, concerning the theory and ethics of setting electric rates. The Alfred P. Sloan
Foundation sponsored the symposium as part of its grant to Davidson College in 1982 designed to increase the role of
technology in the College’s curriculum. The symposium, titled “Technology and Values: Decision Theory and Electric Rates,” is the second one
held this year.

Participants in the symposium included Professors James Walker and Mary Thornberry, representatives from Duke Power Company and other utilities, and
speakers from other colleges. Chemistry Professor Nicholas Burnett presided over the symposium. MacCormac holds a degree in electrical engineering and
is a specialist in the field of electrical utility rates. “Nothing that I have ever encountered has more to do
with philosophy than electrical engineering,” he said. MacCormac gave two speeches during the symposium.

MacCormac’s speech last Thursday outlined many of the keynote utility ratemaking problems addressed in the symposium. One subject he discussed
was the need for private investment in public utilities. “One of the crucial issues of today is can public utilities
attract sufficient capital for the future to continue the growth of electrical capacity?” he said. Noting the failure of many
big-budget nuclear facilities at a cost of billions of dollars, such as the Shoreham Nuclear Plant in New York, he
said, “Right now most utilities are in terrible shape.”

MacCormac also addressed government regulation of utilities. While regulators are authorized to punish inefficiency in utility companies, according to MacCormac
rewards are limited to companies which operate efficiently. “There is really not too much incentive within the system,” he said.
Measuring costs is a significant problem in public utilities, and many people misunderstand the different ways utilities can charge customers,
MacCormac said. “A myth is that there is one objective method of measuring electricity,” he said. “There are many.”

Other speakers in the symposium included Richard Hirsch, Assistant Professor of the History of Technology at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, Stephen
Reynolds of the Pacific Gas and Electric Company, and Chairman of the North Carolina Utilities Commission Robert Koger. Hirsch’s speech
Thursday night dealt with the history of power production and electric costs. According to political science Professor Mary Thornberry, Hirsch’s
talk illustrated the necessity of “putting any public policy into some sort of historical context.” Reynolds spoke Friday about the
Life-Line energy program in California, which guarantees every citizen a minimum quantity of electricity as a basic human right. Koger’s
speech, entitled “Goals for Ratemaking: A National Survey,” reflected the results of a survey he conducted among utilities officials and
public commissioners. Koger constructed a hypothetical utility rate structure based on the results of the survey. MacCormac concluded the symposium
Friday afternoon with a speech entitled “Fairness In Ratemaking.”

The symposia are only one aspect of the Sloan Foundation Grant. The grant also sponsors academic leaves for professors during
the year, applied mathematics workshops for faculty members during the summer, and individual faculty projects during the summer.

**Florida Professor Declines Davidson Sociology Chair**

By BOB LOPER

The College is currently searching for a new senior faculty member to take over leadership of the Department of Sociology
and Anthropology, but it will probably not fill this position until the fall of 1985. According to the current department
chairman, Professor Robert Ruth, the College offered a full professorship and department chair in sociology and anthropology to Graham Kinloch,
who declined the position. Kinloch, whose specialty is racial concerns, will continue his work at Florida State University.

Ruth said he had highly recommended Kinloch for the job and that he felt Kinloch would have been a very
valuable asset for the Sociology department here. Presently, Davidson does not have any full professors in sociology or anthropology.Anthropology. In
light of Kinloch’s decision against coming to Davidson, Ruth and Vice-President of Academic Affairs and Dean of Faculty T.C. Price
Zimmerman are planning to travel to the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association in San Antonio, TX, in late
August to contact potential candidates. According to Ruth, the search for a new department chairman does not reflect any plan
to reorganize or overhaul the curriculum of the department. In its faculty contract decisions made last December, the College did
not renew sociology Professor Peter Venturelli’s contract. Venturelli has appealed the decision to the Faculty Policy Committee, and he will
continue to teach here during the 1984-85 school year. Venturelli declined to comment on the matter.

Participation Increase Pleases Y-Corps Officers
By RAND HARTSELL

“So far the response has been excellent,” said new Y-Corps President Beth Maczka about interest in the Y-Corps since she
took office in December. “Since January things have really been picking up in terms of program participation.” Maczka, who was
the CROP program coordinator last year, explained that the purpose of Y-Corps is to get students involved in community service.
Y-Corps vice-president Chris Blake emphasized that “all programs involve human interaction between Davidson students and community members.” Maczka and Blake
are understandably encouraged by the nearly 300 students involved with the Y-Corps’s ten programs, including two newly implemented programs this
spring.

Maczka and Blake attribute much of the increased student response to improved communication, the service newsletter to be specific. “The
newsletter has been very informative for the students,” said Maczka. “Increased communications between the Y-Corps and students is one of
our goals.” But it is by no means their only obstacle to overcome. “We need money, and we need a
means of creating a sense of continuity and establishment. Presently we are attempting to get an office in the College
Union; an office is something we definitely need,” said Maczka. She added that in the past, fundraising was done in
a door-to-door manner, one which was ineffective in terms of the needs of the Y-Corps’s various programs. “It was a
very time-consuming process and therefore detracted from the Y-Corps’s effectiveness in meeting its goals and responsibilities of service to the
community,” Blake said.

Maczka explained that the Y-Corps is now seeking permission to receive voluntary billing requests on tuition bills, in the same
manner as NC-PIRG. “This way, if someone sees on their son’s or daughter’s bill a space that they could check
off as a $10 donation to the Y-Corps, they might do so remembering that their son or daughter has been
involved in the Y-Corps.” Maczka and Blake also said that one of their goals is to involve campus groups in
projects. They mentioned that the Kappa Alpha Order’s disco for Muscular Dystrophy has always been successful, as has the Pi
Kappa Alpha fraternity’s Kenya Jam which benefits schools in Kenya. “Through more involvement with the Y-Corps, these groups can get
help with organization and planning,” Blake said.

Maczka hopes the College will give the Y-Corps more support in the future. “In the College’s literature, the institution emphasizes
the Y-Corps as an established part of the College community and the greater Davidson community as a whole.” In light
of this recognition, Maczka hopes the College will respond to the organization's needs. “We could also use more faculty involvement
in our program,” she said.

A retreat planned this weekend for the Y-Corps program coordinators is intended to help in the areas of organization, motivation,
and program implementation. “This retreat should strengthen our programs and the Y-Corps overall,” Maczka said. “The more people we can
get involved,” Blake said, “the more viable our programs become. It’s a great opportunity to see how other people live.
At Davidson, we tend to get very caught up in our own little worlds, and we lose sight of the
fact that this isn’t all there is to life. This gives students an opportunity to understand that on an experience-based
level.”
