### Division II Wildcats Face Rigorous Division II Lineup

The past week was tough for the Lady Cats. They dropped two home games to Converse and J.C. Smith as
their record fell to 1-4.

Converse managed to prevail, 54-40. Coach Maye said, “The team is erratic and inconsistent. Sometimes they run the offense well,
and other times they don’t run it at all.”

Against J.C. Smith on Tuesday night, the Lady Cats looked as if they were in for a long night. As
Maye put it, “We got off to a horrendous start. We missed a lot of easy shots after we’d worked
the ball inside to side. Then we just weren’t patient.”

With 10 minutes remaining, Davidson cut the margin to 16, then reeled off 9 unanswered points to pull within 7
with 3:42 remaining. However, they missed a lot of scoring opportunities. On repeated occasions, the ball rolled around the rim
but never fell the way the Cats wanted it to.

Coming out to start the second half, the team found itself in a deep, 21-44 hole. But whatever Coach Maye
said at halftime really lit a fire under the Cats, as an entirely different Davidson team took the floor that
half.

Playing aggressively on both ends of the floor, the Cats really started taking it to Smith. Mike Frankhouser and Jeanne
Womack were a practically unstoppable inside-outside scoring combination. Smith was forced to call numerous timeouts to get themselves regrouped as
Davidson pulled closer.

Despite their efforts, the hole was too deep as they came out on the short end of a 65-49 score.
Maye said, “We really settled down in the second half. It was the best half the team has played so
far. They ran the offense the way I know they can and expect them to. They outplayed Smith in the
second half but were just too far down to win it.” She added, “I’m disappointed in our record so far,
but we’re playing a really tough schedule against Division II scholarship teams. But I’m really pleased with the effort the
team is giving and the potential I see. I see improvement in everyone since the beginning of the season. Jeanne
and Mike are playing consistently good ball for us and giving us good leadership.”

Womack was the high scorer for the game with 22 points, followed closely by Frankhouser with 18.

The Lady Cats’ next home game will be this Saturday at 2:00 against UNC-G. Don’t miss it!

### Athletes of the Week

#### Marion Hill and Jack Smith

Marion Hill and Jack Smith are this week’s Athletes of the Week. This is Marion’s second such honor.

Marion, a junior from Des Moines, Iowa, turned in an outstanding performance in Saturday’s Charlotte Observer Marathon. Her time of
three hours and nine minutes placed her as the second woman finisher in the race, a remarkable accomplishment.

Jack, a junior from Mooresville, North Carolina, ran a phenomenal marathon as well. Jack was moving along at just over
a six-minute-mile clip before he “hit the wall” at the 21st mile. His time was an incredible 2:48 despite the
slowdown.

The Davidsonian would like to extend honors to all Davidson students who competed in the marathon as well.

### Wildcats Prepare for Citadel

Snow canceled the wrestling team’s Wednesday night match against Furman, so the Wildcat grapplers are in the midst of an
open week between the Catawba tournament of last weekend and an upcoming tournament at the Citadel. Coach Robert Estock was
pleased with the performance of his wrestlers at the Catawba tourney. “Considering that we had that long layoff for Christmas,
I thought the tournament was a good thing for our guys. It was the kind of thing we needed to
get back in the swing of things after the break.”

The Wildcats picked up two first-place finishes at the tournament. Senior Scott Smith, wrestling at 134 pounds, decisioned Catawba’s John
Bolton. Junior Chris Tiernan (188) decisioned Joe Crosson, also of Catawba.

In addition to the first-place finishes, freshman Tom Oddo (126) and sophomore Tom Hissam (193) finished second in their weight
classes. Oddo scored a superior decision over Barber-Scotia’s Jeff Best, 18-4, but lost a superior decision in the finals to
Elon’s Jay Linberry. Hissam lost to the Fighting Christians’ Steve Hester in the final round. Lance Stokes and Mike Keely
finished third in the 150 lb. and 142 lb. classes.

Estock is looking forward to the tourney this weekend with high hopes. “The Citadel has a fine Southern Conference team,
Pembroke State is an excellent NAIA school, South Carolina State is a good Division II school, and East Tennessee is
a good group. I’m really looking forward to the tournament, and I think the guys will be ready. This kind
of tournament should let us know where we stand.”
