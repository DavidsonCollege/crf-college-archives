**Freedom of the Airwaves: The Only Alternative**

On May 3, WDAV will reduce its alternative music service, currently the only student-programmed shows, from three hours a day to two hours a day. Reduction in student broadcasting at WDAV is not unprecedented. When WDAV began broadcasting as a carrier-current station in 1969, it was entirely student-run. By 1978, the station was FM, had a broadcasting power of 18,542 watts, and was capable of reaching a possible 2,000,000 listeners. This new broadcasting power caused increasing concern by the trustees and administration about the image of Davidson the station was broadcasting. The minutes of an Oct. 27, 1977 Trustees meeting state “that since by its nature a broadcast station operated for the College will have an impact on the institution’s public relations function, it is necessary that the station and its programming be closely and continuously supervised by the College administration.” With the increased broadcast power and administrative concern about public relations came restrictions on student programming. The students running the station at the time, however, would accept none of the restrictions. After a term-long series of conflicts between the SGA, the student staff of WDAV, the media board, the WDAV board of directors, and the trustees, most of the student staff left WDAV and the station became basically what it is now, a professionally-run classical station with three hours of jazz and rock from 10 PM to 1 AM.

Most of the reasoning behind the recent cutbacks is economics. The station, like all organizations, is worried about supporting itself in the future. Alternative broadcasting, unlike classical, brings little financial support and even less trustee approval.

What the trustees of Davidson College should understand is that WDAV, as a part of a liberal arts institution, adheres to its motto of being “your radio for the arts.” In order not to become “your radio for the trustees,” WDAV needs not only the trustees’ financial support but freedom of programming choice. With Wake Forest’s WFDD’s January 1 extinction, WDAV became the only remaining alternative radio station in the state. All other local stations are entirely commercial and automated. The public does not choose the music they want to hear by buying it; rather, wealthy radio executives cooperate with wealthy recording executives, and together they decide which songs will be heard. These songs, the ones chosen by the executives, are the only ones heard and the only ones bought. And the executives always make safe, unobtrusive choices—never shocking, never innovative.

WDAV’s Flipsides and Jazzsides perform a unique service to the community that will be respected by those who understand the meaning of the words “liberal arts.” The cut in time is acceptable only because of financial necessity; the integrity and substance of alternative radio cannot be questioned. WDAV should be allowed to continue supporting Davidson's liberal arts tradition.
