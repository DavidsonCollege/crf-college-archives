8 THE DAVIDSONIAN STUDY ABROAD WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 30, 2008

“By October, I began to realize that I, too, was really enjoying myself in Paris. Yes, perhaps I should have gone somewhere else, and yes, I still do wonder what I was doing there, but I was happy.

“Noche de Campanas. One night, all of the bells in the churches in the old part of Madrid rang at once. It was drizzling, and I followed a procession of people with umbrellas as we wandered from church to church, guided by the sound.

“After visiting the famous mosque in Djenne, hiking through the Dogon country, bathing in a waterfall and taking a pirogue ride across the Niger River, I am glad now that I am back home with my biological family, but I don’t know any other country other than Mali where I felt so at home-away-from-home.”

“That word has been yelled at me frequently this fall, usually accompanied by little children running and pointing at me. To translate for you, ‘umlungu’ is Zulu for ‘white person.’ The term is not degrading or insulting, but a surprised announcement of an uncommon sighting. The greetings and smiles I receive as I walk down the street remind me of Davidson’s friendly atmosphere.”

“My second night in Bolivia, while we were at a bonfire, the tiny little boy plopped into my lap and fell asleep. For reasons I still don’t understand we began a relationship unlike any I’ve ever experienced.”
