EDITORIAL

GOVERNMENT INSURANCE.
We believe that it is not only the privilege, but also the duty of everyone in military service to take
all the Government Insurance that the law will allow. We are making a study of this feature with a view
to answering any question that may arise in your mind. Many of you will soon be drafted. Now is the
time to find out what this insurance is. What we do not know about its salient features we can soon
find out. It will be considered a privilege to discuss this matter with you. Ask THE EDITOR.

OBJECTS FOR HIPPOCRATES
The week-end registrants in the newly recruited space in Mrs. Robson's Hospital were: M. R. Watt, H. C. Hamilton, and
R. H. Stone. This trio are Knights of LaGrippe. Those who have something that no one else will have are
put downstairs. Those registered upstairs with the mumps (Mrs. Robson's definition: “A solid mass of misery”) were R. R. Deaver,
Jr. and S. J. Hooker, whose jaws they say are quite distended (and the Infirmary reporter is willing to take
hearsay).

If at any time the gentlemen of leisure of the campus want to spend the weekend off the Hill at
a delightful resort, the Infirmary is recommended. Mrs. Robson gives one perfectly fine attention—so gentle, and thoughtful. It is all
delightful, not speaking of the only disagreeable thing—the drug store product, and this isn’t so bad, for with a medicated
form of Na O2 you get grape juice which would make the gods of ancient Greece contemn their nectar and
ambrosia for a sip. The menu widely varies and is appetizing. A typical lunch is: the best tomato soup you
ever tasted, rice, mashed potatoes, crackers, toast, spoon bread, and apricot cream that would make anyone wish they were here.

The DAVIDSONIAN, February 13, 1918

DRILL NEWS OF THE DAVIDSON BATTALION
The Davidson Battalion has made very good progress since it has been organized, considering the bad weather and a number
of cases of sickness among the members of the student body. The companies are drilled on Sprunt Field every afternoon
during the week except Monday. Advance work in maneuvers has been taken up and will be continued throughout the spring.

A very impressive ceremony was begun on Saturday afternoon, when all three companies assembled around the foot of the flagpole
and stood retreat. This ceremony will be held each afternoon at the close of drill. A non-commissioned officer and two
privates compose the color guard, and the flag is lowered at the last note of retreat. While it is being
lowered all officers and men in uniforms without arms stand at salute, men with arms at present arms, and citizens
at attention with their hats in their right hands, placed over their hearts.

The commandant announced recently the appointment of Lieut. J. A. Thames to be captain in command of Company B. He
will perform the duties connected with this office in addition to his duties as battalion adjutant.

C. E. MEETING.
The subject of the Christian Endeavor meeting last Sunday night was, “Our Church and What It Stands For.” C. J.
Matthews, the leader, gave a summary of the Presbyterian beliefs. In the general discussion J. W. Clark emphasized the fact
that although the church as a whole used in olden times to be repressive in its doctrine or commanded what
not to do, now it is active and also points out what to do. It was urged that more take
part in the meetings as a general discussion was of benefit to all. The meeting was dismissed after repeat-ing the
regular benediction.

LITERARY SOCIETY EVENTS THIS SPRING

The following are the dates of spring contests in literary societies:

March 5—Preliminaries for Fresh-Soph Debate.
March 22—Intercollegiate Debate. Davidson vs. LaFayette, at State Normal College Auditorium, Greensboro, N.C.
March 25—Finals of Fresh-Soph Debate (Inter-society Debate).
April 1—Preliminaries of Junior-Senior Debate.
April 7—Intercollegiate Debate, Roanoke vs. Davidson, at Davidson.
April 22—Junior-Senior Inter-society Debate.

Subject of Fresh-Soph Debate: “Resolved, That Woman Suffrage should be adopted by an amendment to the Constitution of the United
States.”

A new plan for the Fresh-Soph Debate has been adopted for this year. Each society will hold its preliminaries on
March 4, and the three best men in each society will be chosen by judges. These men will represent their
society in the final Fresh-Soph Debate between the Eumenean and Philanthropic Societies. At this debate, the judges will decide not
only the society winner, but also the best man of each society, who will be given the Fresh-Soph Debater’s Medal
of his respective society. The success of the plan this year will determine its continuance.

News and Happenings of the Week in Town

Social and Personal Items About the Town People.

Saturday morning the home of Mr. Robert Hager and family was damaged slightly by fire. Mrs. Hager was sick at
the time and suffered from the shock somewhat, though not seriously. The house is owned by M. H. Caldwell, of
Concord, and is known locally as the “Query residence.” Prompt and efficient service of the many students on the scene
saved the house from serious damage.

Miss Frances Worth has been visiting the Misses Vaughn, in Greensboro, during the past week.

Dr. A. A. McGeachy, of Charlotte; Mrs. C. R. Harding and Master Addison Brenizer spent Monday with the latter’s great-grandfather,
Dr. E. H. Harding. Dr. Harding has been sick for some time.

Mrs. W. J. Montgomery, of Concord, and Mrs. Fred Correll, her daughter, of Mooresville, spent Saturday with Mrs. Whitaker.

Mrs. Lola Johnson has been sick for a few days during the past week. In her place in school, Miss
Emma Phifer, of Banner Elk, has been teaching.

Friends of Dr. Munroe were glad to have him resume his weekly visits to Davidson after a prolonged absence and
to know that he has entirely recovered from a case of grip from which he has been suffering.

The International Polity Club held its regular meeting last Friday night. The subject for discussion was, “The Peace Proposals of
