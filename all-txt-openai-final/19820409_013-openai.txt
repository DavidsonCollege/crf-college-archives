Weekly, the Davidsonian has printed a letter from Andy Miller in Kenya. This week, Andy has sent us a copy of Voices of Form II. It contains pieces done by the 16–20-year-old members of Shikokho Secondary School’s first class. As you read them, keep in mind that English is their third language after Kiluhyia and Swahili.

**Remember**

Looking back, now
You condemn my sins,
You say I was primitive;
I did not know civilization,
Because I walked bare feet
I wore skins.
I am Old
But, I fear for you.
Nobody looks back
Nobody slaughters a goat for angry ancestors.
To apologize
For the broken taboo.
Ancestors demand sacrifice.
But, why do you believe the way you do?
But why are my hands becoming white?
I feel ashamed.
Ancient times smelt good.
Large respected little.
And where are they?
Gone
Gone forever.

**An Adventure I Will Never Forget**

Long ago in Africa before the coming of the White man, traditional burial systems varied from tribe to tribe. Among the Abaluhya people of Western Kenya, Mugumo trees were planted on graves as a sign of remembrance. People feared to cut it; they believed that the spirits of their ancestors exist in the tree. Nowadays, this kind of traditional belief is vanishing and is, of course, neglected and ignored due to the mingling of Western Civilization and Christianity. This neglect has caused much destruction and some frightening adventures in African communities, mostly among young people. I have felt such a frightening adventure which I will never forget in life.

It happened abruptly, but with mystery like a vision in the hot sun, when I suddenly came across a man cutting a mugumo tree in the forest. After the tree had been cut, immediately there emerged a Ghost whose outlook seemed mysterious to account. Anyway, it looked shiny with a skinny structure and a spear. It went away slowly, as if caring for its legs and finally disappeared in the thick forest. I was pretty astonished. I went home trembling with fear. My parents took me to the medicine man in order to prevent the Ghost from returning to me. The medicine man told us that the Ghost was a hero and ancestor of the Abaluhya tribe. He died in the battle of Masai. Whenever I see a mugumo tree, I start recalling my Ghost adventure, a memorable experience I will never forget from Ghosts.

**Our School Library**

If you could visit Shikokho Secondary School, which is among the young developing schools in Western Kenya, the most interesting thing you could find is its library. The whole school looks as if it’s friendly to itself. The buildings are of blocks and roofed with material made from crude oil, and if you stand at the gate, you can see the buildings facing one another as if they are shaking hands. If you enter the veranda and look on your right, there is a white door, above it is a glass window. That is the library door. It is also the gateway to the Headmaster’s office.

When you open the door you find a table in the middle of a room which is about eight by six meters. On the left, a cupboard stands full of fruits and plates and even cups. Beside it is a stove for Mister Klaas and some remnants of food on a white sufuria. Five chairs surround the table and a free bench on the other side. A box of balls and nets sits on the right hand of the library and the door to the Headmaster’s office stares at you as if it wants to tell you, you are welcome. And if you try to look at the wall, you could not see any part of it. Above all books are school pictures, and the whole wall is decorated with many kinds of books, big and small, arranged according to the size and subjects.talk about. All books seem to be telling, “You take me please, I am being pressed,” and you could have thought they could all bound on you if you went near them. Even if you had gone to look for a certain known book, you could change your mind to take another one and become confused about what to do. There are books from Australia, America, Canada, and many European countries with different stories that can be found here. Also, the biggest dictionary in Western Kenya can be found here. The library has grown to be a big one due to the efforts of the whites who import and buy books every year. According to the rate of books entering each year, many people say soon it might become one of the biggest libraries among Kenyan school libraries, since each time you go to borrow a book, there are more than 1000 books glancing at you.

A Lesson

It was on a Monday when I left home for Khayega to visit my girlfriend who comes from Isukha location. From home, I didn’t inform my parents about the journey, so I went to Khayega alone and I reached there well, without any interruption on the way. Something strange which I will never forget in my life was that for sure I found the girl waiting for me as it was a promise between her and me. So, as I was approaching where she was standing, she came running towards me laughing, shouting, singing, and mentioning my name: “Cosmas, Cosmas my friend, have you arrived? I thought you were cheating me that you will be here today.” But I didn’t say anything; I was just looking at her because she was behaving like a mad person. Very many people who were there stared at us.

The amazing action which I discovered myself was that the girl was in a fix of four boys, including me, who had come to see her, so I didn’t know what I could do. I continued with my conversation with her. Where I was standing, I found three boys surrounding me. One had a knife in his hand and two of them were just with their free hands. As they came and reached where I was standing, one of them greeted me and I responded, because greetings are there even for those whom you don’t know. There I was asked very many questions and for a few minutes, I found myself trembling, so I dropped my eyes down, thinking how I could escape from that group, but it was difficult. I decided to run out of that group but still, I was in a fix, so as I put my eyes up, I found that there was no girl whom I was talking with. I was left alone to fight with three boys. One of them beat me with a stone and I found myself down, and as I was still down all of them beat me almost to end my life. From there I was picked up by the police and taken to Kakamega where I stayed about three days without knowing where I was. I was there as a stone. The fourth day is when I saw my father, so he tried to talk to me, but I was strengthless, because even to speak to me was difficult. On the seventh day, the policeman came to the hospital and asked me to give him the names of the boys who beat me, but I could not tell the names, so I was left in the hospital until I recovered, and from there I came up to my home without knowing the three boys who beat me. The lesson I will never forget in my life is that I will never seduce a girl who has many boyfriends. If I could be only a friend of that girl, I could not be beaten.
