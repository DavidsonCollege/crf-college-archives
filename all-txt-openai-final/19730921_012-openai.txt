By CHARLES KENNON

The Davidson College Union has several projects that should add a new dimension to the Davidson social scene. These range
from a big show for Homecoming to a renovated bar in the basement of the Union. College Union President Joe
Earle stated, “We have a lot of good ideas for Homecoming, but there are still some contracts to be settled.”
He added that one of the acts would be “The Proposition,” a comedy team similar to “The Ace Trucking Company,”
but with more experience. Earle stated that the Homecoming concert would be “Muddy Waters.” He added that Ellen Kearney is
performing in the Hungry I this weekend.

“The Union has two parts to its program. These are the social and the co-curricular.” The main social event now
is the facilities offered by the new bar. Earle stated that “the bar this year is being radically altered in
the interest of providing the students a place for Rest and Relaxation.” Chairman of the Union Bar Lenny Vincent said
that the bar hadn't cost anything for the new color of concern is the plans to move out of the
building at the school year. According to Vincent, this puts the bind. “We want a simple, inexpensive motif. But at
the same time, it can’t be too Right now I am some old black and posters, and we’ll donations,” he
said.

The Union provides free beer such as Monday night. “The bar can be to go in and raise be a
quiet place depend on the and we won’t try one way or the other,” said.

On a higher level, the co-curricular Union Committee events throughout appeal to various students. However, the program will in new
fields. The mainstay curricular program of lectures through Earle expressed the speakers this year.
