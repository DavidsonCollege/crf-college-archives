Fifteen McCoy Calls Fi NEW PROFESSORS Helen Jepson To Inaugurate Freshmen To Judge Announces New Policies and Methods of Curbing
Court Two Selected. Concert Series October 16 Hutcheson Miniature Opera, Spaulding, Symphony Dance Transportation Round Out Program Disrespect

John Belk, president of the Pan-Hellenic Council, announced Monday that transportation for the Homecoming Dances will be provided. Dr. J.
R. Cunningham announced last week to the Davidson student body, the six entertainment features comprising a concert series which is
to be presented through the year in the Chambers Auditorium. The concert series this year features some of the best-known
names in American music, according to critics.

Helen Jepson, who is to be heard in Chambers auditorium on Friday night, October 16, has long been considered a
leading American artist. She is now with the Metropolitan Opera Company. The second concert of the series will be presented
by a quartet of operatic singers from the Metropolitan Opera Company who call themselves Opera in Miniature. They will present,
in costume, well-known scenes from the operas Carmen, Martha, and Faust. This quartet has performed in most of the larger
cities of the United States.

Ernest Hutcheson, President of the Juilliard School of Music, famous for his part in advancing American music, and well known
as a pianist, will be the third attraction on the concert series. Albert Spaulding, recognized as the violinist who has
for the past several years been featured on the Coca-Cola Hour with Andre Kostelanetz and his orchestra, will be the
fourth feature of the Davidson College Artist Series. Ray and Fraggiotti, a two-piano team which, having played in most of
the large Southern cities in the past few years, has been said by critics to be tops in entertainment, will
be the fifth feature. The final concert will be given by the North Carolina Symphony Orchestra, which has been acclaimed
by critics as one of the best in the South.

The Court of Control for the Class of 1946, sitting under Judge Joe McCoy, held its first meeting of the
year from 8:30 until 10 P.M. Monday night, September 28. About fifteen freshmen were summoned before the body, sitting in
black-robed solemnity in the Haas Hall of the Eumenean Literary Society. Charges ranged from disrespect to upperclassmen and failure to
carry laundry to inciting freshmen to leave chapel along with upperclassmen and not knowing yells when called upon at pep
meetings. The Council felt that this step was necessary on account of the present restriction on gasoline and rubber. As
many of the dates will stay in Davidson, it will be necessary to provide means of going to Charlotte for
the two-night dances.

Jack Richeson, Pinky Wilson, Teensy Hodges, and Bob Gaither took over last week as cheerleaders for the coming year with
Jack Wayman, of course, acting as Master of Yells. Jack Richeson is a member of the Kappa Alpha fraternity. Bob
Gaither is a member of the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity and is also sports manager of the Junior class. Pinky
Wilson is a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity and Teensy Hodges a member of the Kappa Alpha fraternity.

Grouped above are the five new faculty members of Davidson College. They are, left to right: Dr. J. W. Reid,
Geography and Geology; Professor D. Thompson, History; Mr. P. S. Siegle, Psychology; Dr. J. B. Gallent, Chemistry; and Mr. H.
M. Morrison, Physics.

The cheerleaders saw their first action at Winston-Salem in the Davidson-Duke game. Wayman complimented the cheerleaders and also the Davidson
students upon their spirit. Wayman says that another pep meeting after the Rollins game will be held Friday night and
says that he doesn’t expect to see any vacant seats.

The Otts Lectures are a series of addresses given from time to time by distinguished speakers from all over the
country. In 1893 Rev. J. M. Otts, D.D., L.L.D., gave the college an endowment the income from which is to
be used to secure such speakers. The purpose of the course of lectures is to familiarize Davidson students with the
defenses of Christianity against current heresies. The course of lectures was given by Dr. John R. Mott in 1940.

In a private interview with the Davidsonian, Judge McCoy announced that an entirely different system of regulating and punishing the
unruly members of the freshman class has been necessitated by changes caused by war restrictions and other factors. Since rationing
forces most men to remain on campus anyhow, campus policing would have little or no effect on the frosh. New
penalties under consideration are now before the Executive Committee of the College for approval, and Judge McCoy expressed the hope
that they will be in effect soon.

Statistics on circulation for the college library indicate that Davidson students do not show marked originality in the books they
read most. Dr. Chalmers, Davidson college librarian, announced recently that almost invariably the first ten books on the list for
the nation as a whole are the first ten books on the Davidson list.Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving
the original meaning and punctuation:
