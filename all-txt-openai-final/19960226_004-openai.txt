#### Liposuction, lifts and lasers
**Dascombe gives us a glimpse of plastic surgery “now and in the future”**

“Young people seek better mates and better jobs by looking better, and evidence shows that appearance helps,” said Plastic Surgeon Dr. William Dascombe of The Plastic Surgery Center in Savannah, GA, as he spoke to students and faculty Tuesday night concerning the present and future role of plastic surgery.

Sponsored by the Medical Humanities Program, Dascombe addressed the popularity of reconstructive surgery “to restore human form and dignity” as a cosmetic one, stressing that “the keys to beauty are balance and proportionality” and used slides of face lifts, and other adjustments made to the eyes, lips, and nose as illustrations.

Dascombe addressed the direction of plastic surgery technologically, from laser beams to tissue engineering, which he referred to as the “way of the future.” He stressed that although great advances had been made, these solutions are still not “perfect.” Dascombe also admitted his concern for the implications of plastic surgery and where limits should be placed.

Finally, in a question and answer period, Dascombe talked about the rapid growth in the field of plastic and reconstructive surgery, which he attributed to the fact that “most people would rather invest money in themselves than in material things.” “Older people must compete with younger people for jobs, and so want to look their best also,” he said.

#### Prez search from page 1
Sherman says that “the students will be directly involved in the process [of selecting a president]” to replace President John Kuykendall, who recently announced his resignation, effective next spring.

Wick says that he would like to see the new president be “a leader with a vision. In the upcoming years the school is on the verge of change, and I hope that our new president will try to improve the school while also taking into concern the cares and concerns of the students.” The group’s exact function in the search has yet to be determined. Sherman says that the decision as to whether students will be given the responsibility to vote on or simply recommend candidates lies with the trustees.

“This is going to require a lot of flexibility,” she says of the presidential selection task. “The students who were picked definitely placed this as their top priority.” Students appointed to the selection committee, some of whom live as far away as New York, Missouri, Wisconsin, and Georgia, will likely be asked to be present in the area periodically throughout the summer. The group will continue their work next fall as well.

A five-student committee, which included Sherman, Bill Gullan, Wesley Hart, Stephanie Morgan, and Ashley Tabb, conducted 15 to 20 minute interviews with all 23 candidates, during which they “tried to get a general feel for the way [applicants] presented themselves” and what they “valued about Davidson,” says Sherman.

Students have problems with housing for ‘96-‘97

Twenty juniors, three groups of women, and one group of men did not come up with the lucky numbers in Phase I of the RLO Room Lottery. Those juniors planned on spending senior year in one of the 18 five-bedroom apartments available for housing. However, as usual, many people signed up for those spaces, leaving four groups of five friends with some tough decisions to make.

According to Assistant Director of Residence Life Debbie Young, most people usually designate a person out of the five “that will take a single in the event of not getting the apartment.” She says students “should be prepared with another plan since they are told that no one is guaranteed to get a five-bedroom apartment.”

Junior David Kneen and his group of five were left out of an apartment. However, Kneen says, “We have three other friends who don’t mind splitting into two groups of four, so we should all be able to cluster. We are not too disappointed and still are very excited about next year.”

Some of the junior women who did not get five-bedroom apartments were frustrated because they had been housed down the hill and off campus when they came back from abroad this year. RLO director Kurt Holmes sees no changes in the room selection process, stating, “Returning in mid-year has nothing to do with the lottery. The students like the current system and we will keep it.”

The selection process for four-bedroom apartments was also part of Phase I, leaving the options for those who did not get five-person apartments fairly limited. Other juniors found that they had to wait to go through the lottery because they were rooming with current sophomores, despite the fact that these sophomores already have lower lottery numbers. Holmes says that the inherent problems in allowing four and five-bedroom apartments to be chosen in Phase I probably will not be fixed, stating, “It was the desire of the students during the building of Martin Court F (to choose rooms in that manner). Phase II is designed to accommodate juniors (who want to room with seniors).”
