**Our Sterile Uproar**

For a number of years, the students have agitated, talked, and written of increased athletic subsidy. It is not questioned in this editorial whether or not this student ferment was right or not. Perhaps the proposed program of non-subsidy is good. What is questioned is why the Davidson student is never even heard in what he says, not just about athletics, but about cuts, or vespers and chapel, or YMCA membership, or anything else from library hours to the extended duration of the chapel bell’s off-tone knell.

The Davidsonian, “The news and editorial voice of the college,” is recognized by those who work for it as a free press independent of close supervision and able to support anything that is within the bounds of good taste and reason. We hope that we are not transgressing the bounds of taste and reason when we ask why the Davidsonian shouldn’t be free, for it is like every other student organ, a voice crying in the wilderness like a hound dog, and, from all the action it spawns, respected just about as much as its type in the canine world.

Much have we heard during this and past years of our student generation of how the students and the administration have failed to see eye to eye on most issues, of how there has inevitably been antagonism on most issues, whether they be local ones, such as the question of College Union feeding of freshmen, or wider ones such as the athletic policy.

It is not for no reason that there has been so much dissatisfaction among students here. We have felt ourselves in a hopeless position, and none is more able to feel this hopelessness than one in charge of an organ of communication such as the campus paper. For he is able to see his words go down, congratulated or castigated, and then politely forgotten forever, to be dug up only by curio hunters in future years.

But more than this, he comes to realize that what the paper must print are simply club meetings and current events, for nothing ever reaches his hands that is formative of the policy of the College, or at least not before it reaches the newspapers or is so violently rumored that something must be said with regard to it. It is a feeling of hopelessness beyond measure, and also a feeling of helplessness and unimportance, as the student pictures himself unimportant to the life of leviathan, and therefore conceals himself in a shell of cynicism, or worse, ceases to care what he does to or for the institution that is giving him his college education.

It is a situation that is worse than being opposed—many have said that the closest thing to hell is to be given no attention whatsoever. We're closing in.

Now, lest we be accused of accusing somebody of something, let us make this clear: we have tried here to expose a problem that we believe is basic to our situation, but which is the fault of no one. There is simply a lack of cooperation and communication on the part of the elements of this institution which must be solved before any constructive work will ever be done.

Dr. Cunningham has realized this, and has this year had close connection with leaders in the student body in trying to iron out common problems. It was from the president that we first learned of the Ivy League proposals regarding Davidson football. Omicron Delta Kappa has realized the problem, and has served this year as a ground upon which students and faculty could iron out and discuss common problems to all members of the institution, such as conduct, athletics, and the drinking rule. There have been student-faculty committees in the past for similar purposes. Dean Spencer has arranged regular dinner meetings with the Davidsonian Staff to discuss issues of Davidson, and the staff has profited greatly by this close contact with the administration.

But none of these can answer the basic need. Organizations can talk out problems from here to eternity, but until there comes to the students of this campus a belief that the presentation of their views, whether it be through the Davidsonian, ODK, student body meetings, or what have you, is being considered and acted upon by the trustees of the college, there will never be any cooperation here.

The students are neither idiots nor proletarians, but thinking young people, no matter how much their actions seem at times to disprove this statement. And each time they vote one way, as in the case of football subsidy, and find the trustee decision going the other way without hearing an explanation with regard to their interests instead of the quality of Ivy League scholarship or something more nebulous, then they will rebel. And this rebellion will be stopped neither by editorials in the newspaper nor concessions on the part of the administration.

Will we be heard, or do we cry in the wilderness?

It was late October of 1951 that Nat Daniel, columnist for the Davidsonian, began the annual round of athletic dissatisfaction with a contribution entitled “Fifty Futile Football Years, Or What Price Moral Victory.” On the sports page the next week, football held the sports headlines, and pictures of three Davidson standouts decorated the columns. Everyone knew by that time that it would be another fall of defeat, but not everyone knew that within the year the football coach would leave his post, Davidson would fight with itself over the problem of subsidization, and finally that the college would begin a program of small-scale building which this year turned up moderately successful.

Daniel seemed to set the cue for the year when he said “... but despite her seconds and minutes of glory, from the first to last whistle, Davidson has always been a medium-sized college with medium-sized faculties, paying medium-sized coach’s salaries, but due to pressure from defeat-forgetting alumni and many other influences, still sticking her neck into big-time football, and more often than not getting her head chopped off—and so it has been, with few exceptions, since 1900. The question is then, Can Davidson play big-time football?”

Later in the first semester, a poll was taken in chapel which asked the same questions that were asked to students of Davidson this week, i.e., Are you in favor of the present athletic program at Davidson? Are you in favor of deemphasizing athletic subsidization at Davidson? Are you in favor of further emphasizing athletic subsidies at Davidson? Though less than half the student body registered opinions, the results were indicative of the attitude in a year very similar to this one. 16.2% were in favor of the present system. 26.5% were in favor of deemphasizing athletic subsidization. 57.3% were in favor of more subsidy.

Three years have brought more subsidization, and as a result, we believe, the change in student opinion recorded by the Morehead poll of this week. So for years—not just three—the opinion of the Davidson College student body, purported integral to the College, has been for increased subsidy. The Davidson student has wanted, we might say, big-time football here. And what has he received?

The following is quoted from the minutes of the Board of Trustees, May 28, 1954: “We recommend to the Trustees that we authorize the President of the College to solicit and encourage a selected group of at least six colleges and universities to join with us in promoting a program looking toward the abolishing of subsidized athletics (that is athletic scholarships as such) at the earliest possible date.”

Here, we believe, is presented in stark relief the one thing which contributes more than any other to the bitterness on the part of the student body at Davidson. Here is the root of the accusation that Davidson is nothing more than a prep school, a college eternally paternal.

**Subsidy: To Play As Equals But To Maintain Standards**  
**BY CHARLIE COUSAR**

Perhaps you had the same experience I had this summer. One morning you picked up our local newspaper to find an obscure notice tucked away on the second page of the sports section to the effect that Davidson might possibly follow Washington and Lee in taking a non-subsidy view toward athletics. The article went on to say that the Board of Trustees had granted President Cunningham the authority to investigate the possibility of forming a conference of probably six teams in which no athletic scholarships would be given.

Since that time, no formal statement has been given as to the progress made in forming such a conference. Whether negotiations have been successful or whether the whole matter has fallen through is a complete mystery to the students and to many of the faculty members too. However, the time seems ripe for the students to voice their opinion for or against any movement toward non-subsidization or any other change they might wish to see in Davidson's athletic future.

**Student Opinion Poll**

This week’s Davidsonian carries a poll taken by members of the Davidsonian staff in regard to athletics here. Three arbitrary possibilities were set up about which students could express their opinion. The results of this poll show that there is a definite feeling among the student body toward a policy of subsidization. The fact that such an overwhelmingly large percent of the students voted for subsidization of some kind, either as we have it now or increased, certainly should carry some weight with the Board of Trustees or the President or whoever finally decides the issue.

If athletics are primarily for the students, then why shouldn't the students have some part in determining the school’s policy? Or is it true that until now there has never been any policy as such and that one needs to be formulated?

There are certainly strong arguments in favor of Davidson’s having a solid athletic program. By solid, I mean participation with Southern Conference teams such as William and Mary, Furman, George Washington, V.M.I., The Citadel, and Richmond. This would not be limited to football alone but would include basketball, golf, swimming, and the other sports which the college now promotes. And I believe Davidson could maintain such a program successfully. For football, it would take only an increase of $5,000 to $10,000 to push us up into the level, athletically, of the teams mentioned above. A similar increase in basketball would give us the necessary boost. Perhaps a golf and a tennis scholarship could be added too.

**High Scholastic Standards**

Such an improved program would also mean that the scholastic standards would not have to be lowered at all. High school athletes would be screened thoroughly, as prospective football players are now, to be certain that they were capable of doing college work. Certainly no one wants Davidson to be loaded down with a bunch of tramp athletes who have to sign their checks with Xs. But the chances of this taking place are nil with the selection and screening that goes on now. The teams in one respect could be like last year’s football team—above the all men’s average.

Each year there are dozens of high school graduates in this section of the country who are fine athletes and who are capable of becoming...Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

---

Student leaders at Davidson who bypass the college because they are offered scholarships elsewhere. Any number of students could name one of the top tennis players in the Carolinas who was interested in coming to Davidson three years ago and who successfully met each of the requirements for admission. But now he is making a name for himself at one of our nearby schools for obvious reasons. Why cannot Davidson put itself out a little bit and reach more of the boys who fall in this category, who are interested in getting an education as well as participating in college athletics? Perhaps many of us know boys from our own hometown who have had this experience. It would be folly to try to enumerate in such a short space all the advantages of good inter-college athletics. Perhaps many of us know the fact that school spirit would be bolstered, that many more boys would have an opportunity to come to college, and that the name of Davidson would be bettered in the public’s eyes are just a few. Why does not Davidson take this advantage to improve itself and to present a better and more attractive program?

Why Bring Christ Into Christmas?
BY GILBERT GRAGG

“Everybody seems to be trying to get in on the Christmas bonanza,” commented a sophisticated twentieth-century American after seeing Santa with a cocktail glass in a liquor advertisement. “Why the next thing you know the churches will try to climb aboard the holiday bandwagon!” In this materialistic age of aspirins, aperitifs, and atoms there is no reason, however, for the church or any of us to be concerned about the birth of the Bethlehem Babe for our lives. Let's be realistic about it!

Students at Christmas

Christmas for us means eagerly awaited holidays, gala parties, getting gifts we do not need, eggnog, etc. There will be no time for genuine self-analysis in our frantic search for pleasure to re-orient our lives around that of the Nazarene. We are too intelligent and sophisticated (after all, we are at Davidson) to take seriously a poor carpenter who was not even born on the “right side of the tracks” and was a different color from us at that; we want good times, popularity, and money — certainly not a cross which is all the suffering Galilean promised his followers. Christ might just as well not have come as far as you or I are concerned.

Country at Christmas

Silent Night, Holy Night. (Stores jammed — says sales top ’48). All is still (Last minute Gift Rush). All is bright (Brilliant dances and cocktail parties scheduled for the 25th). ‘Round yon Virgin Mother and Child. (Look has five pages showing “America’s new miniature dolls are best dressed in the world” — 30 percent of the children of India die before reaching five). Holy Infant ($100,000,000 being spent on 1,500,000,000 Christmas cards with 10 percent religious), so meek and so mild (eager child awaiting Santa on Christmas Eve overheard saying when God is mentioned: “Why what is He going to give me for Christmas?”), Sleep in heavenly peace (Washington tactics cloak “America First” policy in garb of Christianity), Sleep in Heavenly peace (“I’d shoot the first nigger who stepped inside my church!” says a southern elder at a local meeting on evangelism).

Christ would probably be more at home in Russia on the 25th than America because He preferred sincerity to hypocrisy in national affairs as well as personal ethics.

Church At Christmas

In a great many of our churches Christ’s incarnation makes little difference. Many ministers, it seems, have recognized that we live to please ourselves and are never happier than when self-satisfaction comes—thus they tell us what we want to hear, and salvation becomes a mental peace of mind. We want Christianity to show us how to be financially successful, well-adjusted, and contented as the proverbial cow. What room does this leave for the suffering and sword Christ brought? Dostoevski was right in stating that the Church would reject Christ if He came again? Toynbee’s concluding litany in his Study of History merely mentions Christ along with other saintly figures through the ages instead of proclaiming that his divinity makes him the end of all religious seeking—thus if the child in the manger had never been born it would have made no difference since we have several other splendid moral teachers to guide our lives. Anyway, the theological trend now is for “universal salvation,” so faith in Christ as the son of God is not necessary. Our church has no place for Christ when he advised us to lose our lives; we are trying frantically every way we know to find them!

Epilogue

While writing this I have been listening to a program of Christmas music on the radio — “All I Want for Christmas are my two front teeth,” “I Saw Momma Kissing Santa Claus,” “Blue Christmas,” “Silver Bells” and now Eartha Kitt is enticingly cooing forth with “Santa Baby.” Wouldn't it be much more appropriate to celebrate Christmas on Good Friday?

Students Manifest Apathy To Gift Fund
By TOMMY THOMPSON

A familiar rumble of laughter terminated last week’s unsatisfactory clarification of the Gift Fund project. As everyone slowly filed out of chapel, I realized that the laughter was not the result of the usual cynicism, boredom, rudeness, or even humor, but that the chuckles were justified. Who would not manifest his awe orally at the declaration of giving $4,000 to a mirage? No other action could be expected when this mirage is merely defined as some Christians teaching some uneducated Greek peasants how to farm. Does it take $4,000 to teach a man to dig a hole and plant a seed in it? Unfortunately, however, the task of the Christian team in Greece is a little more complicated and tedious than we have been told. Having worked this summer in Mexico for a similar basic educational team as the one in Greece, I feel compelled to attempt to expose summarily for the reader the pressing reality of an otherwise indistinguishable dream. The area of work far exceeds teaching people modern methods of agriculture and animal disease control to replace their prevalent, primitive customs. These backward people know nothing about basic sanitation in regions where their bathroom is the backyard and their stove is a hole in the ground. Disease runs rampant, particularly among the young children, most of whom hardly survive infancy. Bodies are weak not only because there is a limited food supply and disease is prevalent but also because recreation is foreign to them. In their spare time they waste away in idleness not knowing even simple games, not to mention the absolute lack of materials and facilities for recreation. Adding still another problem, there are few schools in the rural, impoverished districts where the team works, in which the people can learn to help themselves. How difficult it is for us who live in the blessings of plenty to conceive that the above conditions exist in our world today. Furthermore, the people abiding in such deprivation are unwittingly apathetic. Not ever having any better state in which to live, they do not know or want any better. Such indifference is dissolved only when new ideas and attitudes are absorbed by them. Thus, with the aim of instilling within the people a desire to help themselves, the team furnishes some of the materials, teaches them orally, and works alongside them as a peer. Accomplishment and success appear only when in confidence the people begin to feel the necessity of solving their problems by using their own initiative and resources. The glaring need and possible range of work is evident to us. Our gift can be used to procure more materials for the team and more teams for Greece. It is not a quick or easy process to stamp out poverty, disease, and illiteracy. Yet our small personal donations can further the cause of Christianity in a tangible and practical manner as well as prove to the world that we, as Americans, are striving for world peace by assisting our foreign neighbors in their fundamental needs. Bonaro Overstreet has said: “You say the little efforts that I make will do no good. They will never prevail to tip the hovering scale where justice hangs in balance. I don't think I ever thought they would. But I am prejudiced beyond debate in favor of my right to choose which side shall feel the stubborn ounces of my weight.”

Book, Magazine Committee Praised

Have you been in the College Union lately to see the brilliant display of books which grace each side of the spacious fireplace with its crinkled copper covering? This striking array of literature is the inspired work of Messrs. Gilbert Gragg, Bob Brown, Joe Conarroe, and Frank White, members of the Book and Magazine Committee (known to their intimate friends as the B & M Committee). These gentlemen are to be especially commended for their regrouping of books. Formerly, literature of various types was thrown together with no obvious consideration of subject matter. Now, however, books are logically grouped, as can be illustrated by the fact that This Was Cicero is placed directly next to Our Modern Money and Banking System. May the corporate Davidson family congratulate each member of the B & M Committee for a job well done! — John Harmon

THE EDITOR’S MAILBOX

On ROTC Publicity

Sir: How dare you let that real bad letter about our ROTC be published last week. Since I have been at Davidson it has done more for me than any other branch of activity and I have also been in PT so I should know don’t you think. Our Tuesday afternoon marches have built up my thighs and calves and every Tuesday when I am finished I feel real good and ready to study again as soon as I have had a good supper and also ROTC classes give me a lot of knowledge about the real important things that I should know about if I ever have to fight for a war and so don’t you see that I have a pretty good reason for not wanting to read The Davidsonian any more after this anyhow. The men at the ROTC dept. are doing real good this year already and I know that most of the students are interested in their articles in the paper. So please continue to print them and I will keep right on reading them every time you come out on Friday night. (SIC) Disgusted, Nosmo King

On Janitors’ Salaries

Dear Editor, I saw in the New York Times recently a rundown of New York's Hundred Neediest Cases. Since the Christmas season approaches I think it is time for the students here to consider Davidson's neediest cases. The majority of them fall into one category: they are the hired help of the college, and especially the janitors. Our Presbyterian institution is said to underpay its faculty, but I believe that the janitors may be said to break some sort of record with their weekly wage of about $30.00 (plus social security, Blue Cross, and a coal discount, of course). At that wage, our college has fulfilled the truly Calvinistic code of frugality and industry: our janitors must not only save what they have, but their whole families must work also to keep food coming in. I don't want to intimate that they should be paid more. After all, the College knows best. But I do think that the students should save a dollar or two out of the hamburger money and give it to the janitors so they and their wives can celebrate Christmas with the rest of us on December 25. Sincerely, Bill Evans
