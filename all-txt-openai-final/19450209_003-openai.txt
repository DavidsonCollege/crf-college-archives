Along with the many good boys who are not here this semester, is Jim Lowry. Jim was a great basketball
player as well as a swell fellow. In all the games this season, Lowry has been the star spark-plug of
the team. The team was built around Lowry for in most of the games he was the best man on
the floor. Because of his accurate set shots and cool thinking during a game, he was named on the All
Southern Conference team. The News called Lowry the “Cassius of the Courts” because of his lean and hungry look, but
that statement had a double meaning for Jim proved to be a dagger in the back of Davidson’s opponents. We
all miss him as a friend and as a swell basketball player. He will never be forgotten.

Lowry is not the only basketball player who has left the Davidson court. Gabby Bryant has quit school for the
duration, also Phil Edwards. The team will miss these two. Gabby with his fighting spirit and Phil with his complete
collectiveness have made names for themselves in the Davidson hall of sports.

Without these men, the team is pretty well torn up. A sports writer in the Charlotte Observer said, “I don’t
think Davidson will win another game.” This was proved to be a false statement when the Cats defeated the College
of Charleston. The team does not look the same, but at times it seems to be its old self. It
seems doubtful now if the team will get to go to the Southern Conference tournament. However, you can’t tell what
Coach Shepard can do with his boys.

Fraternity basketball will start again, now that exams are over. It should prove exciting. The S. P. E.’s who were
winning have lost Owens and Neill to the Varsity, and other frats have gained men. You can’t ever tell who
will win now, so watch it closely, for it will be fun for all.

We profoundly believe that there is nothing like Varsity-Town's Covert topper. It can be worn more months in the year
than any other coat; it’s comfortable, it’s stylish, it’s practical. We know that once you've worn one of these coats,
you'll never be without one... it’s great!

CATS WIN AT CHARLESTON

Beat Maroons In Close Game

The Davidson Wildcats defeated the College of Charleston Maroons 32 to 28 in a close and exciting game. The Cats
started out slowly but finally got going. Linwood O’Briant played an outstanding game and was high scorer with 14 points.
Owens, Blackburn, and Wall also looked very good on the court.

The Charleston Maroons, a small and scrappy team, took the lead early in the game but the Cats overtook them
before half time and managed to keep the lead through the remainder of a close game.

Citadel Takes Davidson 52-32

Citadel defeated the Wildcats 52-32 at Charleston in a game which was slow and unexciting. At one time in the
first half it looked as if it would be very close for the score was 20 to 16. However, the
Wildcats got no more in this half which ended 27 to 16. From then on it was just how much
Citadel would beat the Cats by. When Citadel comes to Davidson the 13th of this month maybe it will be
a different story.

Let's hope so, hmm?
