**SEPTEMBER 16, 1931**

Mrs. Smith, our very successful supervisor of dormitories, has an inspiring editorial in this issue on “The Immorality of Ugliness.” We recommend it very highly to our readers.

The only thing that keeps Rumple from being a veritable hotel is its lack of elevators. Those who did not see it before can hardly appreciate what a magnificent change has taken place. The college authorities are to be congratulated.

Around 250 Freshmen enrolled! That doesn’t sound so much like a depression. Still, I’ve heard there was one—somewhere.

Let’s back that Wildcat team this fall! They are going to be in there fighting every minute of every game, and they're going to win with the support of the student body. We'll get Wake Forest this year!

Davidson College is very fortunate in getting the type of speakers they are able to secure. Dr. Mims is one of the finest that they will have. Everyone should hear him.

The improvements in the walks, buildings, and grounds are gratifying. The walk to the post office from Chambers is one thing that has been needed for several years. And now we won't have to count the steps from Chambers to the post office via the “Y” building and the other way.

**THE OLD STORY**

Speeches, warnings, talks, friendly counsel, all have been given at one time or another on the subject of getting a good start in the present school term. My writing on this subject will probably only add to the general impression that all of it is just so much talk. But an attempt will be made, because it is the preeminent thing at this time.

No one will deny that in every field of endeavor, regardless of what type it may be, a good beginning gets one a long way along the road to success in the project. Two Seniors were talking together on different subjects and the conversation finally drifted to scholarship, and to the honors to be achieved in this field. One of them remarked that his average was not as high as he could have made it had he only tried a little harder. The other replied that his trouble lay along a little different line; that he had really done his best during his Sophomore and Junior years, but that he had not started during his first year. He said that this was a terrible handicap to overcome, and that he only wished someone had told him during his first days at Davidson to start out strong. He probably had received that advice on his entrance to the college but it had made so little an impression on him that he had forgotten it. Nevertheless, it is true that if one really digs in at first and makes a running start in his work, the rest of the time is comparatively smooth sledding. That applies particularly to the new men. A good impression at first is a great help at later times.

**GREETINGS**

This is a very unnecessary piece of writing, because everyone realizes that at Davidson there is always a welcome, and also because greetings have been given much more fluently and more expressively than we are able to give them here. Nevertheless, may we add our word of welcome to those already extended, and say to the new men that there is a place for them here, and that they have only to take it. May we also take this opportunity to hope that you “had a good summer,” wherever you may have been and whatever you have been privileged to do. Interesting are the accounts of summer vacations, and possibly none are so fascinating and varied as those told by Davidson men on their return from summer trips, from vacation work, from all the places at which they have spent the three months interim. There is one regret that we have in saying this little greeting, that being that we do not this year have the pleasure of seeing and associating with those members of the Class of 1931, the Seniors who graduated last year, and are now facing the problems of life in a real way. They have our best wishes for success—and they may need them, from all we can hear.

Let us add to what has been said in various other places, for the especial benefit of the Freshmen, that a spirit of cordiality and friendliness exists on the Davidson campus; it is a natural thing, because that amiability is not forced. Men speak to each other when they meet, they converse with each other courteously, not because they have to but because that is the feeling that exists here. There is a rule requiring the Freshmen to speak to everyone they meet on the campus. This is a new rule and is not intended to force the new men to do anything that is distasteful to them, but is rather a guide to help them to become better acquainted with the customs here. It is to be hoped that the rule will not make the greeting less cordial.

**THE IMMORALITY OF UGLINESS**

I had, recently, the great pleasure and gratification of listening to a beautiful and impressive talk delivered by a man of learning and culture, on the subject, “The Immorality of Ugliness.” He spoke sincerely and convincingly because he believed what he was saying; in fact, he knew what he was saying. It is doubtless true that most of us have been taught, and therefore can readily recognize, the ugliness of such traits as dishonesty, ill temper, injustice in its many forms, indifference, intolerance, unfairness toward our fellow men, bigotry, and egotism, and probably many other attributes of a distinctly selfish nature. Each of these characteristics can easily be classed as an “immoral ugliness.” But how many of us, I wonder, have ever realized the immorality of the ugliness of our physical surroundings. I mean by this our environment, the places in which we live, our homes. The very room in which we live,move, and have our being is sending forth—though we may not be conscious of it—a very decisive impression of some kind. The love of beauty is an emotion that is almost holy, so what must the lack of it involve? We must first recognize ugliness before we can appreciate that which is lovely and refining. “The Immorality of Ugliness!” Think of it! A famous author has said: “Beauty is the index of a larger fact than wisdom.” 
Mrs. N. T. Smith, Supervisor of Dormitories.

CHANGES
There are several changes in this issue of the paper which will, unless another alteration is made necessary, be carried throughout the year. It is hoped that they will meet with the approval of the student body. Any suggestions or remarks concerning them will be welcomed.

First, the size of the paper has been increased an inch each way, making the columns one-sixth of an inch wider. At first, it was decided to add another column, but this was discarded as being impractical. Secondly, the kind of type used in the heading, THE DAVIDSONIAN, has been changed. It was decided that the Old English bold was a little too heavy for the rest of the printing. Two new column-head cuts will appear in this or in the next issue, one for the humorous column and the other for the sports column. The policy of having the publication out by Wednesday is to be continued this year if possible. Apologies are extended in the event that it does not get out by that time the first issue.

Factories, mines, construction camps, and other enterprises in Siberia as well as the Red army. Everywhere he discussed various problems and showed how they fitted into the Five Year Plan. At the place where the Kuznetz steel plant is under construction, Voroshiloff told the workers: “Your construction is being watched not only by the proletariat of our union but by the whole international working class. This is because along with other giants of the Soviet industry, your metallurgic plant will decide the question of who shall prevail and will arm the international proletariat for the struggle for socialism.”

There is no crime problem in our land today, murders, thefts, lust, and lawlessness to the contrary notwithstanding.
Rt. Rev. Ernest V. Shayler.

The present government of Chile recently distinguished itself by putting down a revolution, a thing almost unheard of in a Latin-American country. This extraordinary achievement was made possible through the use of the air force. Aggressive fighting for the right is the noblest sport in the world.
Theodore Roosevelt.

Governor William H. (Alfalfa Bill) Murray again comes to the front but as yet he hasn’t used his troops. At the Chicago jubilee of the American Federation of Labor, he turned upon the bankers. They should be barred from serving on the Federal Reserve Board, the Oklahoma governor contends. “I’m for making the banks lend to manufacturers and producers, so that business can go ahead.” At present, he has not suggested using troops as he did in the opening of a bridge and in the closing of the oil wells.

Despite the severity of the crisis, wage cuts have been confined to the smaller companies or the mismanaged industries.
William Green.

On October 21, 1929, Professor Fisher, Yale economist, declared: “I believe that we will have a ragged market for a few weeks and that then we shall see the beginning of a mild bull market that will gain momentum next year.”

I certainly have no illusions about my personality, or attractiveness.
Rudy Vallee.

And now good evening, ladies and gentlemen. We will be all up in the air again next week. Maybe we'll settle the unemployment problem, or the question of the negro. Probably the (mu-latter). This is STATION-E-R-Y, and we are broadcasting at the rate of 100 motorcycles. Putt! Putt! My lad! Well, Carbolic Acid. Them’s our sediments.

Storming and thundering WHOA! (is me). It’s a good thing I stopped when I did. The third verse would have been all dote. But the idea in the second verse is supposed to be modernistic. You’re supposed to read between the lyin’s. But to return to what I was saying before I began: Back again... still dizzy trying to figure how the summer passed so quickly... the same old place... good old place. Lots of changes... but I can still recognize many of the old laundry marks... Rumple... girlish-like with its new coat of paint... BUT THE SHOP!... and the STUDENTS’ STORE!... somebody evidently started in... to paint the town red... Maybe I should explain... the title I have chosen for this column... and the nautical little sketch... I wish I could... but I don’t know... The inscription “CABBAGE AND KINGS—” means I have no particular subjects (or objects) of which or about which I intend to write... The MIRTH OF A NATION... well... I think that must have been the outcome... of a nightmare... that’s my story anyway... and I'll stick to it... because I’m not a “second-story man”... Having no explanation of the ship... I'll do the next best thing... I’ll dedicate it to someone... To Christopher Columbus, nautically esteemed Explorer, who took the words right out of my encyclopedia when he said, “Four Pintas equal One Galleon,” I dedicate the above drawn ship, therewith including all that it “holds,” any profits that may be realized from its sails (sales), and just for a good turn, the steering wheel. Good old Crisco Lumbus! Auf Wiedersehen. “Sail on,” I shout derisively. (Chris gets wind of what I say, and sails on).

Every column is supposed to have a policy. I have taken out a Prudential one. I was undecided about what plan I would adopt. First, I considered the Morris plan, but later I decided on the Russian Five-Year Plan, (but this is not to be confused with ALCOHOLSHEVISM, because I don’t believe in that). Someone, I believe it was Pope, said that “Whatever is, is right.” One of my plans will be to prove conclusively that whatever is, is wrong. Another plan is to settle, once and for all, the gangster problem, the wheat surplus problem, the race prejudice problem, and many others; (“The half can never be told”). After showing that truth is not as strange as fiction, I shall proceed to show that what America needs most today is not a good five-cent cigar, but something to put old razor blades in. Furthermore, I shall prove that the customer is never right, and that gentlemen prefer brunettes. Now that I have stated all my plans, the next thing in order is to forget them. I shall probably end up by proving that columnists are a sorry lot anyway. As Will Rogers once said: “A columnist is not supposed to be serious, nor to know much—.” Not to mention the Scotchman who wants to know if a fellow who wins a hundred thousand dollars in a lottery gets his purchase price back too.

The curfew tolls the knell of parting day,
A line of cars winds slowly o’er the lea:
A pedestrian plods his absent-minded way,
And leaves the world quite unexpectedly.
—Judge.

We suggest, for an Elegy-ble title: The Vanishing American. But the pedestrians are vanishing in other places besides America. Scores of people are run down by autos in Russian streets every day, and nobody pays the slightest attention. It seems that Plucky Russia is determined to be up-to-date at any cost. Which reminds us of the story of the man who was riding in a taxicab in New York City last summer. As the cab raced down the busy street, another cab suddenly hove into view, coming like mad straight toward them. The man was paralyzed with fright, but what could he do? His driver, a very tough-looking specimen, appeared as cool as a hibernated polar bear. Instead of stopping, he simply increased his speed and charged ahead. Finally, just a split second before the cars would have collided, the other car swerved to one side, barely avoiding a terrible smash-up. The driver of the first cab turned around to his petrified passenger, and grinned: “I knew dat guy wuz yellow!”

Some people make their own way, and others have Life’s Little Consolations. Napoleon was a penniless second lieutenant in 1785, and in 1804 he was crowned emperor. John Bunyan, author of “Pilgrim's Progress,” was a traveling tinker.
