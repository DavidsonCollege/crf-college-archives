Heath Whittle

One of the best athletes who ever ran for Davidson closed his career last Saturday when Capt. Heath Whittle ran his hurdle race, the 220-yard lows in the State meet at Greensboro. During his three years of varsity competition, he has been one of the most consistent performers on the squad. He capped all previous performances this year when he regularly won from fifteen to twenty points each meet. He scored 90 points during the season, counting the West Virginia meet and the Tech Relays. The outstanding performance of his college years was undoubtedly the great race he ran against Sol Furth, N. Y. U. champion, in the West Virginia indoor meet last March. Whittle pushed Furth the entire distance, losing out only by a hair, according to observers. In writing to one of the Davidson students about the race later, the alumni secretary of West Virginia said, “Whittle is the real hero of the meet. He was unknown to most of us, while we have had Furth with us before. Oh! boy, what a race!” It will be a task to fill his place after graduation, either on the track or off. One of the finest men Davidson has had on her teams!

The State Meet

The State intercollegiate track meet, held in Greensboro last Saturday, was one of the best conducted in recent years, judged both by the number of contestants and the records made. The weather conditions were perfect; the track was in good shape and very fast, and it was not enough to cause any trouble in keeping the athletes warm. If anything, it was too hot. Spectators and officials alike took off their coats for greater comfort. And to push the matter a little further, Joe McCall and Kinzey, of Wake Forest, did their broad jumping without jerseys, wearing only trunks. The directors of the meet had provided all the necessary mechanical equipment for the proper carrying-on of the competition. A public address system was used for announcements and calling of events; an anemometer was set up to check the speed of the wind in each race, so that any records made would be counted official. The only thing lacking was a scoreboard. The running score was announced two or three times, but beyond that, no one in the stands knew how the teams stood from time to time, except that Carolina was ahead. Starting blocks were used for the take-offs in all the sprints and hurdle events. This was the first big meet in this part of the country that these have been used in, and there was some divergence of opinion among the contestants as to their worth. Most of the Davidson men who used them didn’t like them so much.

The 100-yard dash attracted more attention than any other single event of the afternoon’s program, due to the presence of Charlie Farmer, Carolina ace. He easily won both the trials and finals of the century, his time on the latter being 9.8 seconds. His form was nearly perfect, and he never seemed to extend himself when he ran. Whittle ran the high hurdles in 15.2 seconds, smashing the state record by one-tenth of a second, but the mark was not allowed to stand as he had knocked over the last hurdles. George easily won second place in the event. Whittle also won the lows in 25 flat. He was not closely pushed in either of his races.

Four Left

Only four more games remain on the Davidson baseball card, and two of them...

Davidson and Lenoir Split Pair of Games

The Davidson nine divided a two-day engagement with the Lenoir-Rhyne diamond outfit, losing the first contest on the home field by the close score of 5 to 4, but winning the May Day contest, at Hickory, 8 to 4. Timely hitting at opportune moments when bingles meant runs helped the Lenoir-Rhyne Bears to defeat the ’Cats in the first game. Although Davidson was able to outhit the Bears 11 to 9, nevertheless they were forced to take the small end of the score. Captain Doc Kugler pitched nice ball for the Davidson team and collected four singles in as many times at bat. Winecoff for the visitors hit the best, getting three hits out of four attempts. The Wildcats were in form the following day at...Hickory and trounced the Lenoir-Rhyners 8 to 4. McInnis and Kugler both pitched fine ball and had the Bears at their mercy, whereas the Davidson batters were (Continued on page 4)

Wildcats to End Season With Duke and Carolina Meet University of South Carolina Here This Afternoon

After the game today with the University of South Carolina baseball team, the Davidson nine will conclude its schedule with three more tilts next week, two with Duke, and a return game with Carolina. The Wildcats journey to Durham next Monday to play the Blue Devils, go to Chapel Hill to play the Tar Heels on Tuesday, and then conclude the season with the return Duke encounter on Richardson Field Thursday.

Duke’s prowess on the diamond this season is highly commendable. The Blue Devils, who have won more than two-thirds of their games, have just returned from a northeastern trip where they trounced many leading college teams, namely, Villanova, Princeton, and the University of Pennsylvania. When the Wildcats meet them in Durham, the host will begin the game with a record of one score victories. Farley, Kistler, and Werber, outstanding Duke stars, and the last a big league prospect, will give the Davidson hurlers a real test with their slugging, if they are in regular form. The hitting of these three men has been a feature in the past showing of Coach Jack Coombs’ pastimers. Jenkins and Hawkins, southpaw aces of the Duke pitching staff, may prove to be stubborn opposition for the Wildcat swatters.

On Tuesday after the game at Durham, the Davidson baseball team will attempt to avenge the defeat received at the hands of Carolina earlier in the year by playing the Tar Heels on their home diamond. The Carolina 9-3 victory over the Wildcats at Winston-Salem will furnish Davidson a good reason for fighting hard enough to even the balance. Although the Tar Heels are not as strong as the Duke nine, they will supply plenty of opposition if their leading hurler, Cecil Longest, is started.

Coach Younger’s team is in good condition, most of the injured players having recuperated. Nab Armfield, sterling backstop, has returned, but will not be able to receive in any more games this season, because his infected foot is still weak.

Red Parrish added to his string of three base hits by hitting four Bear pitchers all over the field.

Capt. Heath Whittle, who last Saturday closed a great college track career, won both hurdle events at the State in excellent time.
