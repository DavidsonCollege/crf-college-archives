The DAVIDSONIAN, August 25, 1916

THE HIGHLANDERS AT THE FRONT.

In a speech delivered in Scotland some time before the war with Germany, Lloyd George spoke of the Highlanders as the finest soldiery in the world. He did not then realize that their services in battle would be needed so soon. But they responded to the call to arms as no other part of the great empire has done, although all have acquitted themselves nobly. That the Highlanders have lived up to their past reputation and have justified the confidence placed in them is shown by the following:

The situation at Longueval and Delville wood has been full of trouble. Ever since the places were taken by the Highland regiment on July 14, the Germans made repeated counterattacks from the upper end of the village, where they still held some machine gun emplacements and kept the way open through the German trenches on the north, so that the Germans could send up supports and supplies. From the north, also, the Germans concentrated a heavy artillery fire on the southern part of Delville wood, which was held by the South African troops and maintained a violent barrage. Nevertheless, the Highlanders held on nearly a week with a dogged endurance that frustrated all the efforts of the Germans to get back on their old ground.

They were led forward by their pipers who went not only towards the German lines but across them and into the thick of battle. It was to the tune of the "Campbells Are Coming" that one regiment went forward. Then the pipes screamed out the charge, the most awful music to be heard by men who have Highlanders against them, and with fixed bayonets and hand grenades, they stormed the German trenches.—Presbyterian Witness.
