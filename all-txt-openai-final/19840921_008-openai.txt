**R.E.M. Graduates From Bar Rooms To Mega-Seat Arenas**

By STEVE MANK

A year-and-a-half ago, a band came to play in Love Auditorium to a near sell-out crowd. That was pretty good back then; this band was accustomed to playing bars and fraternities, with no guarantee even of an audience. After two years, the band is in the area again. But things are a little different now.

R.E.M. does not have one van for its four members and all their equipment. Now band members ride in roomy air-conditioned buses. Now they have two highly touted LPs (Murmur and Reckoning), and are the subjects of retrospectives by such magazines as Creem and Song Hits. Now, every word they utter (or mumble) seems to be the teachings of prophets handed down to disciples.

But R.E.M.’s climb to fame over the past two years has not been abrupt. Four years ago, when they first began, they were rough, playing cover versions of little-known songs while dancing like whirling dervishes on a spartan stage. When they played here twice two years ago, the setup (and dancing) was virtually the same. Just two months ago R.E.M. sold out Atlanta’s mega-seated Fox with almost the same arrangement.

R.E.M. is a little slicker now, but it is not REO Speedwagon. The band has some lights and a team of soundmen, but lead vocalist Michael Stipe can still rip open the collective eardrums of an audience with a wail no soundman could stop. Lately Stipe has assumed a barely conscious posture onstage, but that’s just shyness, or a phase, or both. But beyond those, the changes are few.

“It’s not as big and glamorous as everyone thinks it is,” drummer Bill Berry said in an interview last week. The more things change, the more they stay the same. “I still like to go out and tie one on with the locals,” Berry revealed.

The problem, it seems, is that it is hard to be a rock and roll version of Horatio Alger and still maintain any normality. Fans wait at stage doors, interviews are scheduled, plans are made, and the question, “What does R.E.M. mean?” rings in band members’ ears several times in a single day. “This sounds like the real ‘Pompous Rock Star’, but sometimes you just want to go back to the hotel and not deal with people after the show,” Berry confessed.

Among roadies, agents, record executives, and fans, it's not easy for the group to find friends. In fact, they are probably closer now in big buses than they were years ago in minuscule vans. Surprisingly, the band has undergone no personnel changes since it began, and probably never will. The band’s unity fascinates Berry as much as anyone else: “It could be a fluke; it could be destiny — either way it’s rare and I don’t know how to explain it but the chemistry is just remarkable,” he observed.

It’s a good thing, too, because for R.E.M., maintaining sameness in a world of flux is not easy. At the beginning of the year, the band heads back to the studio (not, incidentally, at Charlotte’s Reflections). Meanwhile, rave reviews keep piling up, crowds get bigger, and a spare minute gets rarer.

But for Berry, the fame thus far has not been unbearable and he can always find solace in little things. “I’m not gonna get mobbed by people like Sting would,” he observed.

R.E.M. will perform Sunday evening at the Park Center in Charlotte. At press time, tickets were still available at the Center and through Charlotte record stores.

**Of Royal Births And Hurricanes**

My younger sister often asks me if she really does look like Princess Diana, and she puzzles...over the possibility of snagging a Prince Charming of her own someday. I used to tell her, “Yes, Buffy, Prince Andrew is still single; and if you hold out long enough, William and the new Harry could be fair game as well.” Her princess dreams seemed reasonable enough to me; who wouldn’t want open access to a yacht named after those encyclopedias? But my view has changed after reading of the harrowing birth experience Diana underwent to produce Henry Charles Albert David. I am speaking, of course, about Royal Birth Hurricane Syndrome. Palace officials tried to play down the connection, but they couldn’t fool me. I noticed back in ’82 that a tropical depression coincided with Prince William’s birth. A hurricane before Harry didn’t surprise me a bit. So when Buffy asked me last week if she still looked like Diana, I said, “Sure, but if you marry Prince Andrew, do you really want to wreak havoc in faraway countries every time you have a baby?” She thought about it, agreed, and decided that life as a Kappa Delta at Alabama fulfilled most of her fantasies.

Soccer Bleu

The Class of ’85 is the last to have seniors in the None-Down-and-Five-to-go Club, now that the P.E. Department has beefed up athletic requirements. The cachet of saying “Yeah, I almost passed Trim Swim” will vanish come next spring, and everyone will be healthy and un-pasty looking a lot sooner. In the meantime, the department is catering to the intellectual side of those delinquent seniors with a course called “Soccer Theory” (PED 30A). Dozens of students packed the Gym conference room Tuesday night, where the avuncular Charlie Slagle — the Charles Kuralt of sport — led them on a journey through the back roads of corner kick and offsides theory. Good to know that these young people — mostly women, curiously — will leave Davidson able to talk about or even execute an inbound-flip throw from mid-field (for a winning score with three seconds left) with the best of them. Next Week: Tractor pull.

Man the dippers. Prepare to deploy the X-33 flavors. The ice cream war is on. A new Cornelius “shoppe” has robbed the Union Café of its ice cream monopoly. Ever since ice cream made the cover of Time last year it has been quite in vogue, culinarily at least, along with colored pasta, tofu, styling mousse and other generally gooey things. Perhaps ice cream is the single most tempting forbidden fruit of the rich, thin, and beautiful generation. So if you are a dietary degenerate seeking a new thrill, Carolina Cone wants you.

Cornelius’ first (and only) ice cream parlor, Carolina Cone Arises As Rival To The Ice-Cream Throne

Carolina Cone, formerly Cornelius Fish Market, formerly Lone Star Taco, serves 28 flavors of ice cream from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily. A single scoop is 60¢ and is humongous. Personally, this galloping gastronome doesn’t like ice cream over much. The ice cream experience ceased to be exciting when I outgrew adding Tang and cornflakes to a heaping bowl of vanilla and making mom mad by mushing it around. So I simply invited some gullible gastronomical guinea pigs down to Carolina Cone to help me “get the scoop.”

Galloping Gastronome: “What do you think of the atmosphere?”
Steve: “I like the indoor lawn furniture.”
Peggy: “It’s really clean. I like that.”
Alex: “They need diet flavors.”

Tim and Barry, co-assistant managers, say business has been good. Carolina Cone carries 4 brands of ice cream, Borden, Sealtest, Deluxe, and Breyers [the Union Cafe serves Pet]. Tim assured me that any youngster who loses his scoop on the floor gets a free replacement. Obviously, Carolina Cone has something to suit anyone's tastes. We even had a floor show — a 4-year-old break dancer. That’s the scoop folks. Carolina Cone is located in uptown Cornelius on Historical Highway 115 next to the ambulance service.
