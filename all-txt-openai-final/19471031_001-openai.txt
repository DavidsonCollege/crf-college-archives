CHOSEN FOR ‘WHO'S WHO’

Faculty Committee Picks Honor List

14 SENIORS

Davidson College has selected this year’s twelve outstanding men for the annual Collegiate Who’s Who. Each year students are nominated
by a faculty committee who judge the candidates for all-round worth, including such attributes as scholarship, leadership, friendship, athletic ability,
potentiality for future usefulness to business and society, and other general qualifications. The students must be members of the Senior
Class, although in times past juniors have been selected. The quota for Davidson College is twelve men with a two-man
margin in either direction. The purpose of this publication is to create, on a national basis, recognition for outstanding students
in the various colleges. The first edition of Who's Who in American Colleges and Universities was printed in 1934-1935. The
annual publication also serves as a recommendation for students as employees in the business world. Its business goal is “To
firms requiring employees we propose to seek desirable prospects; for those students listed in our book in any year since
its beginning, we propose to seek desirable positions. It is our purpose to keep these leading graduates before the manufacturers
as the most promising candidates for employment.”

The men selected this year are: Dave Blevins whose home is in Spruce Pine, N. C., and who is freshman
adviser for the current year. He was secretary-treasurer of the Junior Class last year, and was assistant baseball manager. He
is a member of ODK, the Beaver Club, and the “D” Club. Blevins is vice-president of SPE social fraternity.

Alumni Returns For Homecoming

On Saturday, November 1, according to Alumni Secretary John M. Payne, Davidson College will act as host to the largest
total number of students and returning alumni ever to assemble on her campus. Mr. Payne recently announced that the final
plans for Davidson’s annual Homecoming celebration have been completed. The highlight of that eagerly awaited day will be the Davidson-V.M.I.
football game on Richardson Field at 2:30 in the afternoon. A capacity plus crowd is expected by the college. In
the banquet hall of Chambers at 12 o'clock the alumni will gather for a barbecue luncheon for which tickets will
be sold in the lobby at one dollar a plate. Mr. Payne is planning to use the south court, behind
the south rear door, in order to accommodate the record crowd. Following the luncheon, at 1 o'clock the alumni will
adjourn to the auditorium at which time the Male Chorus will present several selections. After the musical program, the installation
of new Alumni Association officers, presided over by retiring President Dr. James P. Hendrix, Class of '25, of Winston-Salem, will
take place. Mr. John P. (Shorty) Williams, '16, of Philadelphia, will be installed as president, and Mr. Robert E. Kell,
'29, of Brison, Va., as vice-president. Mr. Kell will be installed in absentia. Candidates for these offices are customarily nominated
at commencement each year and voted upon by mail. The ballots are then counted on September 1 and the men
elected are installed November 1. All alumni are urged to invite their friends and relatives to all of the Homecoming
functions, and to arrive early Saturday morning in order to visit various points of interest about the campus. Among the
students, Jerry Robinson, head cheerleader, has requested all of the presidents of the different societies, organizations and honorary fraternities to
decorate the buildings in which they meet or for which they are responsible.

Independent Group Begins United Action During Homecoming

In the three weeks since its creation was announced, the newly formed Independent organization has gotten well under way. Almost
a hundred members have pledged their support, and this total is expected to more than double during the year. All
Independents who believe that the social aspect of a well-rounded education is important in one’s college career are urged to
take advantage of this opportunity of emphasizing this aspect. It is believed that a group working together is the best
way to accomplish this aim and it should be of great benefit to all who support this organization. One may
join merely by accepting the organization’s constitution (which was printed in THE DAVIDSONIAN of October 17) and by submitting a
letter of application to the organization’s officers.

Festivities Begin With Formal Dance At Charlotte Armory

By BILL DUBOSE

The long-awaited weekend has finally come around, and if everything goes as planned this should be one of the best
Homecomings in the history of the school. The festivities officially start tonight at 9:00 o'clock in the Charlotte Armory to
the tune of Billy Knauff and his band. As the Pan-Hellenic Council announced earlier, the Friday night dance will be
formal and will last until 1:00 o'clock. All fraternity houses may remain open after the dance until 3:30 a.m. The
Saturday night dance is to be presented in the ballroom of Hotel Charlotte. This dance will be informal for both
boys and girls and will last from 8:00 to 12:00. All 11 fraternity houses will have to close by 12:00
p.m. on that night. We remember Billy Knauff as having presented music for the 1947 Spring Frolics. Many considered that
set as the best of the three given by the Pan-Hell last year. These dances are presented for the enjoyment
of the entire student body, fraternity men and independents alike, and only if they have the support of both groups
will the dances be a success. Much color will be added to the weekend by the decorations. As is customary,
all fraternities will have their houses adorned in Red and Black and their lawns covered with V.M.I. graveyards, etc. A
new plan was placed before the student body in chapel last Tuesday morning whereby such organizations as the Y.M.C.A. cabinet,
the literary societies and the like decorate their respective buildings. This should add much to the forthcoming game and the
two dances. We should all find ourselves Saturday in the midst of the greatest, most exciting Homecoming.

WHY I COULDN'T WAIT FOR HOMECOMING

By DAVE GAMBRELL

Recently on the campus of a well-known Carolina girls’ school the following conversation was overheard:

First P.G.: “What are you doing this weekend?”
Second P.G. (only more so): “I’m going to Chapel Hill.”
First: “You lucky dog, I'm going to Davidson.”
Second, wincing: “I wish there was something I could say that would go to the limit.”

The theory behind the practice is good, but the practice is nefarious. Homecoming at Davidson is too nefarious that word
