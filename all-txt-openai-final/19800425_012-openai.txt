**Spirit Square in Charlotte**

In Charlotte this week, Spirit Square has three presentations for the culturally minded. On Saturday, April 26, an act which calls itself "Bolcom and Morris" will be on stage. This pair of entertainers amuse and delight with their own types of music. Then the Paratore Brothers will appear on Wednesday, April 30—duo-pianists who have gained recognition throughout the U.S. On the theatrical side, the Johnson C. Smith Department of Theatre will present "In White America," a play by Martin B. Duberman. This drama chronicles Black America’s struggle for a dignified place in American society.

Joan Morris and William Bolcom are more a theatrical act than a musical one. Morris, a soprano, is accompanied by Bolcom on the piano for a selection of favorites from the '30s and '40s. In between songs by George Gershwin, Cole Porter, and other big names, these two entertain with their own style of wit and comedy.

The Paratore Brothers got their start as duo-pianists when they performed with Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops. Their latest release through New World Records is *La Nuit des Tropiques*.

All showtimes are 8:15; tickets are $6.00 for the musical presentations and $4.00 for the drama. For information call 376-8883.

**THERE'S THE CAMERA! SMILE, DEAR!**

**Human Flag**

If you happen to be down on the Ayatollah, or are just desirous of some attention, the chance is yours to participate in "The World’s Largest Flag." This Sunday (April 27) at 3:00 p.m. in Freedom Park at Charlotte, an estimated 5,000 volunteers will attempt to stand in formation holding color cards, to make the flag.

The event is being staged in support of the hostages in Iran and is sponsored by WAYS Radio, Sundrop Bottlers, and Harris Teeter.

**Eating In Charlotte**

It’s a good time of the year for restaurant hopping, so here are a few recommendations (and warnings) regarding some of Charlotte’s better-known eateries.

**Nakato on Independence Boulevard**: If you’ve never been to a Nakato (or any other Japanese steak house), you are in for unique entertainment as you watch your food being expertly (and humorously) prepared right before your eyes. Prices are fair if you consider that you're also paying for the entertainment of your personal chef—however, if your appetite is hearty, you might wish for larger portions of food. The food is good... but then, I am partial to Japanese cuisine. And even with reservations, plan to wait for a seat.

**Tuesday's in Eastland Mall**: This is a fun place to eat—reasonable prices—a great salad bar stocked with the makings of a truly wonderful salad plus cheeses and homemade bread.

**House of Hunan on East Woodlawn**: The word must be out that this is a fine restaurant: students and faculty seem to be frequenting this place more and more. Hunan features both Cantonese and Mandarin dishes—the food is excellent and the service is professional. Go with just a few friends—or in a party of twenty—you'll enjoy it. Be daring... try a little plum wine.

**They Laughed at Edison on Monroe Road**: I’m not as excited about this vegetarian restaurant as some seem to be—patrons go through a cafeteria-type of line and pay a little more than the food is worth. The entrees are interesting, however.

**Godfather’s on Independence**: This informal pizza parlor was my freshman hall’s favorite—it opened four years ago and has been going strong ever since. The pizzas are good—the toppings generous. And afterwards, there’s a Baskin & Robbins nearby.

**Saucy Crepe on Providence Road**: What can I say about this classy place? The repertoire of the Saucy Crepe is delightfully different, the crepes are heavenly (especially the dessert crepes), and the service is excellent. Even my roommate loves the fine dining here. It’s a good idea to make reservations.

**Substation on Independence**: Even though the Substation doesn’t appear particularly appealing, it is. The atmosphere in the evening is rather informal—cozy, relaxed—and the prices are low. The food selection is of the sandwich/sub, salad, and quiche variety. Their quiche is, in fact, of the best quality, and is only surpassed by their hot brownie cake topped with ice cream.

**The Sandwich Construction Company on Independence**: There are several of these in the area, but I’ve only visited the one on Independence. This is a "cute" place to eat because the construction motif is carried out to its fullest—even the menu is of blueprint design. Generous sandwiches, fair prices, and a lot of interesting mixed drinks that I'd never encountered before.
