The DAVIDSONIAN, April 23, 1919

Sophs Win Loving Cup In Field Day Meet
Murray Highest Individual Scorer. Seniors are Second.

The Sophs walked away with the championship in the Field Day meet, scoring 46 out of a possible 99 points.
The Seniors won second place with 24 points, an excellent score in view of the fact that only three men
represented this class. The Freshmen came out third with 18 points to their credit and the Juniors last with 11
points, ten of which were made by McQueen. The Sophomores, as a result of the meet, were awarded the beautiful
loving cup presented by L. Richardson, Jr., of Greensboro, N. C., one of the most fondly remembered of Davidson’s alumni.

The individual honors of the meet went to Harry Murray, ‘21, who recorded 16 points. McQueen was in his old-time
form, winning the high jump and pole vault. A. R. Craig proved himself to be the best long-distance man, winning
easily the mile and two-mile. McLeod of the Freshman class won the shot put. The summary is as follows:

FISHERMAN'S LUCK

A minister with two lovely girls stood entranced by the beauties of a flowing stream. A fisherman happening by and
mistaking the minister’s occupation, said: “Ketchin’ many, pard?”
“I am a fisher of men,” answered the preacher with dignity.
“Well,” replied the fisherman, with an admiring glance at the girls, “you sure have the right bait.”—Montreal Journal of Commerce.

The melancholy days have come
The saddest of the year,
The movies move to empty seats;
Each girl a lonesome dear.
The students no longer smiling
They have a careworn look,
Beneath the arm of everyone
Is found a well-worn book.
Examination days are near,
The saddest one can find,
So it’s get to work, you rummy,
And grind, you bonehead, grind!

Wildcats Take Second Game From Elon, 2 to 1
Miley Received Wonderful Support. Pitched Good Game.

In the second game of the series with Elon, Davidson came back in good form and evened things up with
their opponents. Bill Miley, pitching his first game for the Wildcats, allowed only six scattering hits and struck out six
men. It was his pitching, coupled with unusually good support on the part of his teammates, which enabled Davidson to
take the big end of a 2 to 1 score.

Both of the Wildcats’ runs came in the first two frames. Spann, first man up for Davidson, walked and took
second on Miller's single to left. Cassell laid down a neat bunt, advancing both runners, and a moment later Spann
scored on Ratchford’s grounder to short. Johnson ended the scoring by grounding to the pitcher.

In the second inning, after two men were down, Sample smacked one on the nose for three bases and took
home on a wild peg. Things looked bright again in the fourth inning when Johnny Richards poled one to the
left field fence with nobody out, but the hopes of the Davidson rooters quickly subsided when he was tagged out
at third base.

Elon’s lone tally came in the seventh. Johnson, the first man up, beat out an infield hit and went to
second when King singled. Marlette singled to center, scoring Johnson and advancing King to third, but was pegged out a
moment later trying to make second. Brown flied to Ratchford and Atkinson was out on a grounder to Sample.

In the ninth session, Elon threatened to score again on a belated rally. After two men were out, Sides, hitting
for King, doubled to left center. Doughton, another pinch hitter, ended the game by knocking a long fly which Spann
pulled down in deep center.

The features of the game for Davidson were the pitching of Miley, the fielding of Sample, and the marked improvement
in the hitting of the entire team. Murphy was the outstanding star for the visitors, accepting five chances without a
bobble and making one of the six hits credited to Elon.

Trinity Wins Game Here
Davidson Loses Slugging Match to Trinity, Score 9 to 2.

Trinity defeated Davidson in the latter’s own “backyard,” Friday, April 18th, by the score of 9 to 2. The score
by no means does Davidson justice for she truly had the better of her opponents in everything except the breaks
of the game up to the last spasm. Errors by the Davidson battery and infield boosted Trinity along mightily and
Currie was touched for many timely hits. The ninth inning proved a disaster. After the scoring in this inning had
been started by Wildcat errors, the “Bulls” helped the dirty work along by some old-time fence “busting.”

The game went along nicely until the ninth. Davidson had scored once and Trinity four times, errors playing a prominent
part in the scoring of the Methodists. Then came the fatal inning when the game developed into a farce. Tome’s
single started things off in Trinity’s half of the ninth. McArn got mixed on Wannamaker's roller down the first base
line and all hands were safe. Then the comedy—for some, tragedy—began. Hits, runs, bonehead plays and errors happened so rapidly
that a triple shift of scorekeepers were unequal to their task. Seven hits, combined with many errors of omission and
commission boosted Trinity's score to nine. Finally, Currie settled down and forced Tome to pop up on his second appearance
in the inning and Wannamaker to “windmill” at three fast ones for the second and third outs.

The famous “Wildcat” fighting spirit was never better demonstrated than in the last half of the ninth. Although the score
was nine to one against them, they went after the gentle slants in a vicious manner. Ratch slammed the first
ball pitched to him to the right field palings for a triple. “Cop,” always ready to lend a helping hand,
scored the little second sacker with a hefty one-ply wallop to left. Things were beginning to boom. Rich came up
with a firm desire to “knock a board off”—and he almost did it, for his blow to deep center looked
good for about four cushions until friend McArthur took it in hand. It was a splendid catch and saved at
least one run, for “Cop” was on his toes to give an imaginary rabbit a swift race from first to
home, via second and third. Cole's jealousy of his teammate’s fielding ability forced “Cop” to break another pressing engagement with
the home plate and abide yet a little while in the garden of Eden. Also, it robbed Sully, batting for
McArn, of an extra base blow. “Buck” Currie had good intentions, but Carroll got the ball a scant fraction of
an inch too high and Wannamaker took in “Buck’s” fly for the Wildcats’ twenty-seventh out.

The game was a slug-fest from first to last and everybody (especially the Trinity outfielders) had a busy day. Hathaway
played a beautiful game in left field for the winners and in addition connected for three hits out of five
trips. Wannamaker at third and Edens at first fielded excellently for the Methodists. For the Presbyterians, Ratchford was the shining
light. Besides playing a good fielding game, Ratch scored one run and drove in the other. His three-bagger in the
ninth was the batting feature of the day. Johnny Richards made several nice running catches in right. Johnson is developing
into a dangerous hitter in the pinches. He hit hard and often in Friday’s game.

Batteries: Carroll and Carson; Currie and Johnson.
Summary: Struck out by Carroll 3; Currie 2; bases on balls, off Carroll 1; off Currie 4; hit by pitcher,
by Currie (McArthur); stolen bases, McArthur. Umpire, Mr. Miles.

One does not realize the dangers that surround any undertaking until he has them set before him in some such
graphic way as the following, reported by an exchange: “He crossed the Atlantic twenty-seven times and never got drowned but
once,” Bridget assured her caller. “Indeed. And which one of his trips was it he was drowned on?” “I’m not
sure, but I think it was the twenty-seventh.” “He was lucky. Many a man would have went to the bottom
on his first voyage instead of waiting till the last.” “Right ye are. More people are drowned by water than
by railroad wrecks.” “It's a fatal death, begorrah.”

NO EVIDENCE OF IT.
“Does your daughter play the piano by ear?”
“No, she uses both hands and both feet, but I don’t think she has learned to use her ears.”

“Camouflage”:
“Mr. Smith, can you spell the word for Sun in Espanol?”
Johnny didn’t know so he replied, jokingly—“S, O. L.”
