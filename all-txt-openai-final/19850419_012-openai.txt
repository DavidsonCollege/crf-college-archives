Help the Photo Staff

This great photo was found lying around The Davidsonian office, and it’s just begging for a creative caption... Drop all entries to this contest in the box at the Union Desk—all captions should be legible. Next week we’ll print the best (or at least the best printable ones). The winner gets the intense personal satisfaction of seeing his or her name in print!

Homer

Why Homer can't fly...

Every day, Homer would bounce up and down, furiously flapping his little wings, so that he might be like the other slimmer, more diet-conscious insects. But to no avail. He tried hard and tried... but he couldn't. So here he lies. Discouraged, fat and stupid, you say. “Can't I do anything to help?” Yes, you can. The next time you have the urge to toss bread crumbs to bees—Stop. That bee might be a Homer.
