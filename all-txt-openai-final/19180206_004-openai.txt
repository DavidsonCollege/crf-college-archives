In addition to their regular course of study, three Davidson alumni at Union Seminary, Richmond, Va., are doing an hour or two of teaching each day in preparatory schools and college—thereby helping to make up for the inadequate force of teachers in these institutions. H. A. Scott, ‘16, has three hours of physics per week in Union University—a colored institution. Scott finished the three years of Physics at Davidson. H. Eikel is a tutor in a private home, near the seminary. R. H. Ratchford has an hour and a half of work in McGuire’s University School—a private preparatory school for boys in West Richmond.

Davidson has three alumni in the teaching force of John’s Hopkins University Medical Department: Dr. Thos. Peck Sprunt, ‘03, a brother of A. Sprunt, ex-’18; Dr. Robert Sydney Cunningham, ‘11, and Dr. Wm. Carson Von Glahn, ‘11.

C. P. Karriker, ex-’20, is in the aviation section of the army, stationed at Fort Omaha, Neb. In a recent letter to The Davidsonian and students, he writes as follows:

“August 9, 1917, I enlisted in the United States Army Aviation Section, but was transferred into the balloon school shortly after my enlistment. Probably you would wonder what part the balloon would have in this great war, but the balloon is one of the most important factors in this modern warfare. However, they do not do any actual fighting, but they are used for observation only, and are called the eyes of the army. They direct all movement of the artillery and infantry.

“I am glad that so many have returned to old Davidson, for I feel that they could not have made a better choice, and I hope the time will not be afar when I can return to Davidson College and there finish my work.”

The alumni editor would be glad to hear from other former students, who are now in the service of Uncle Sam about their work and other items of interest.

The brotherhood of mankind must no longer be a fair but empty phrase; it must be given a structure of force and reality. The nations must realize their common life and effect a workable partnership.—Woodrow Wilson.

One taper lights a thousand, Yet shines as it has shone; And the humblest light may kindle A brighter than its own. —Hezekiah Butterworth.
