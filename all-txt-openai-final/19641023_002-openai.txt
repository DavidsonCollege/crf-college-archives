**Of Standardized Tests**

In the Trustee action on the faculty oath last week are several changes of significance:
—The wording of the pending religious test should prove less onerous than the present vow.
—Utilizing the format of a religious test rather than an oath should be less offensive to those involved.
—Taking the oath publicly at commencement, a frequent complaint, has been eliminated.
—Religious requirements for the Bible and Philosophy Departments have been altered so that faculty members in the departments do not necessarily have to be Presbyterians.
—Only a majority of the full professors must be Presbyterians under the pending change. Presently, 75 per cent of that group must be Presbyterians. (Accompanying this proposal is another, namely, that a majority of the entire faculty must be Presbyterians. Currently, there is no such requirement.)
—All faculty members who have not taken the oath will be required to answer the prescribed religious questions before being granted tenure or a promotion.
—Prospective faculty members will be required to answer the prescribed religious questions prior to nomination.

The pending questions are not as acceptable as those approved by the Trustees in their February meeting this year, questions which were not formally passed in May. However, relative to the present vow, we feel the proposed changes are a decided improvement if a vow is necessary.

Undoubtedly, the College has the right to set the requirements for faculty members. But does this mean that a formal inquisition of prospective faculty members is necessary, whether in the outline of an oath or merely as prescribed questions? There exists on our faculty a small number of otherwise qualified men who in honesty to themselves cannot submit to the present vow or pending questions. The vise in which they are now placed is quite real.

But our greatest concern is for Davidson College in the years ahead. Davidson has made significant steps towards providing for both her faculty and students an atmosphere of responsible freedom, an atmosphere conducive to open discussion and creativity. That this freedom is not superficial—that freedom really exists—is obvious to anyone associated with the college. Hopefully, this liberty is cherished by everyone associated with the college to the degree that we cherish it.

For the Trustees to determine to place before each prospective faculty member certain prescribed religious questions is an honest action. Davidson is a liberal arts institution, a school devoted to ferreting out the Truth, whatever it may be. And she is attempting to be honest and truthful with prospective members of the faculty. Nothing is hidden: prospective faculty members are confronted with the prescribed religious questions before nomination.

But in her attempt to be truthful, the College is promoting a lie, a lie that hurts the institution. Unfortunately, the questions will all too frequently be viewed as indicative of an institution concerned with indoctrination. And hopefully the College is attempting to hire men interested in education, not indoctrination. Davidson is not a dogmatic institution, but we sincerely fear that such will tend to be her unwarranted reputation in future years.

What then can be done? Is not Davidson College a church-related, liberal arts institution? We feel that the standards expected for teachers desired at Davidson should be made clear by the Trustees after consultation with members of the present faculty and administration. Then the President and Dean of Faculty should be entrusted with the responsibility of determining whether prospective faculty members measure up to these standards. The manner in which the President and the Dean of Faculty assure themselves that the requirements are met in prospective professors should and would vary according to the individual under consideration.

In this manner Davidson’s religious ties could be maintained in a harmonious relationship with her increasingly proud tradition of the liberal arts education.

**The Tide Turns**

The action of the Supreme Court Monday raises questions as to the Court's consistency: the justices refused to rule on a complaint by a group of white parents in Brooklyn, N. Y., whose children were assigned to a new junior high school outside their home area on the basis of race in an effort to bring about more “balanced” integration. Even in contending that “neither their (the children’s) race, color, creed, nor national origin is made a criterion for their admittance” to the junior high school, the New York City Board of Education conceded the site for the new school was selected “primarily because it is located on the fringe of an area which is predominantly Negro and Puerto Rican and near an area in which the large majority of residents is white. Board policy is that integration be one of several factors in the selection of sites and in the zoning of schools.”

The parents petitioning maintained: “Petitioners do not object to having their children attend school with non-whites. They do object to the assignment of their children to a school in a slum to satisfy a ‘political compromise’ brought about by pressure on the board of education solely because their children are white.

“Had the same treatment been given to children of any other color or race, it would never have been countenanced by any court. Petitioners (the white parents) believe that the constitution is color-blind, and that they are not to be denied rights granted to others solely because they are white.”

A decade ago the Supreme Court evoked what appeared to be an incessant uproar by ordering the end to “separate but equal” public school facilities. In explaining its action the court stated in part: “To separate them (children) from others of similar age and qualifications solely because of their race generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone.”

Of particular interest here is the phrase “solely because of race.” In essence, the Court’s 1954 decision ordered that race not be a criterion in determining what school a child will attend. The court attacked very specifically the doctrine of “separate but equal” facilities; less sharply stated—but nonetheless present—was a refutation of race as a criterion in pupil assignment in public schools. The obvious feeling of the 1954 Court was that the Constitution is a “color-blind” document, that all citizens are accorded equal rights and privileges under it.

But while the Constitution is held to be a racially indiscriminate document, apparently the Court makes racial distinctions. Ten years ago the plaintiffs were Negroes; this year the petitioners are whites. Ten years ago race as a criterion for public school assignment was abolished by the Court; this year the Court refused to hear charges that race was being used as a criterion for public school assignment.

The actions must be reconciled before justice can be meted out. The actions cannot be reconciled.

**Flagging Spectator Spirit Upsets Davidson Alumnus**

Dear Editor:
I attended the Homecoming football game with Richmond last Saturday and was of course disappointed with the result as were other friends of Davidson. I was, however, more disappointed with the apparent lack of school spirit by the student body as evidenced by the mass exit of students and dates during the early part of the fourth quarter. No matter the score, your representatives on the field were giving their best and deserve support. I hope this incident is not truly representative of the ‘Wildcat’ spirit at Davidson.

Dear Editor:
I would like to take this opportunity to answer some questions concerning the Great Issues program which were raised in your last edition. This year’s Great Issues is “Politics—Election ‘64” and deals with aspects of the issues facing the people in this election. The program attempts to present both sides, and give some aspects of the dialogue between liberal and conservative views.

The program is organized in three parts: (1) scholars preparing the students on aspects of the issues; (2) actual politicians themselves, to reflect the campaign; and (3) a resume after the election. Dr. Triffin, with the help of Dr. Patterson, started the series. The second part is between Republicans and Democrats. For the latter are Sen. Randolph, Harry Golden, and Henry Hall Wilson. For the former are Charles Mitchell, Mr. Babcock, hopefully Sen. Thurmond, and Representative Jonas, giving the Republicans an edge of one.

Dr. Triffin started the program off on the high level it was intended. He gave an objective view of some of the more important economic issues which will be decided in this election. The international monetary system, and its implications to foreign aid, balance of payments, the gold standard, and aid to underdeveloped nations are issues on which both presidential candidates and parties have taken differing stands.

Perhaps I should now list those Republicans which we invited. They are: Barry Goldwater, Richard Nixon, Margaret Chase Smith, Claire Booth Luce, Governor Scranton, Sen. Tower of Texas, and Gov. Underwood, the 1960 keynoter at the Republican convention. I would also say that if Senator Goldwater had come to Charlotte before 12 o'clock on the 21st of September, he would have stopped at Davidson. Gov. Wallace, a conservative, was unable to find a suitable date after tentatively accepting.

**FROM THE BACK OF THE BUS**

**Barry And Bill Miller: ‘Myth Shrouds Reality’**

By CHARLES RAMBERG
Davidsonian Associate Editor

Election day draws near, and Barry Goldwater continues his wild swings about the nation, making charges and then explaining what he really meant to say to the confused voters. We would like to help him out by clarifying three of his positions that have attracted...Much interest. Our purpose is only to elucidate, for we realize the futility of attempting to convert the Goldwater disciples. We must tread carefully as we try to penetrate the Goldwater fog, for we know that anything we say will probably be dismissed by Goldwaterites as a “glib” statement. In recent weeks, the Republican candidate has stepped up his attack on two issues, alleged “softness on communism” by the present Administration and “immorality” in that Administration. The first charge is a gutter issue not worth considering here. It calls to mind the witch-hunts carried on by Joe McCarthy a decade ago. That the accusation is preposterous is indicated by the fact that even Dick Nixon denies its truth. We guess that Barry only raised it to please the John Birch-nuts and their ilk. The second charge, the first of the three to be seriously considered in this column, is that corruption has tainted the Johnson administration. The Republicans, we are told, will clean out men like Walter Jenkins and Bobby Baker. A glance at the Republican past is no cause for reassurance. Republicans still flinch when they are reminded about Teapot Dome. And more recently, the G.O.P. gave us Sherman Adams and vicuna coats. Of course, it isn’t fair to lump Barry with past Republicans and say that he is condemned to commit their mistakes over again. He is, by general admission, an uncommon Republican. Will he bring morality to Washington? No, he will bring with him William Miller, hardly a man from whom great devotion to principle can be expected. Miller has already been snared in one conflict-of-interest charge. But his finest hour was in 1956, when he rather abruptly changed his mind on civil rights legislation then pending in the House of Representatives. Miller was listed as a sponsor of the rights bill and vigorously supported it in committee. During the debate, the Senate passed a measure to authorize the federal government to develop electric power at Niagara Falls, which is in Miller’s district. As a major spokesman for private power, Miller saw his chief hope of stopping the power bill in the House Rules Committee. During floor debate on the civil rights measure, Miller completely reversed his position, calling the bill unconstitutional. House Rules Committee Chairman Howard Smith and committeeman Colmer of Mississippi then pigeonholed the power bill. The complete hypocrisy of Miller's turnabout was put in glaring relief by his vote for the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Republicans might want to compare Miller’s conversion in 1956 to that of Paul on the road to Damascus. We call it “wheeling and dealing” in its crassest form.

Opposition to public power projects is one of the principles Senator Goldwater is supposed to adhere to the most strongly. He has called the Tennessee Valley Authority “a socialistic venture” and has advocated selling its steam plants to private interests. Yet he is co-sponsor of the Central Arizona Project (CAP), a billion-dollar federally-financed scheme to siphon off Colorado River water to irrigate thirsty Arizona farmland. Providing the power to pump the water over the mountains into Barry’s home state will be two huge federally-financed dams. Other power produced at these dams will be sold. Somehow Barry Goldwater draws a distinction between CAP and TVA, supporting one and attacking the other. Apparently, his position, as one observer remarked, “is that if you spend $1.7 billion for a public power project to serve several Southern States, that is socialism. But the spending of $1.1 billion for the same purpose in one state is enlightened conservatism — if that state just happens to be Senator Goldwater's.”

How much will the Walter Jenkins case hurt the Democrats? A week unbelievably crowded with urgent news developments revealed a new scandal in the Johnson administration, a power shake-up in the Kremlin, “nuclear noises” from Red China, and a hurricane — all potentially big developments on the American political scene. The latest Washington scandal certainly will hurt Johnson — the question is how much? Goldwater's charges of immorality and corruption in high places seem both prophetic and knowledgeable after last week. Some news sources and analysts say that local and state races will also be affected — saving a few Republicans otherwise in trouble. While it is quite possible that the impact of the scandal will be balanced by the impact of recent foreign news, the Johnson lead will probably be cut down. These recent news developments, coming just at a time when the Johnson campaign peaked and began a decline, give a sharp boost to a rising Goldwater tide. The race in many states was already close: now it is even closer. There is a feeling prevalent that this election is going to be a disaster for the pollsters. Veteran news analysts say there is something unpredictable in the mood of the people this year — no one is sure what this portends. No matter who wins, it is quite likely that the pollsters will be embarrassed. This is because there are so many “submerged” issues this year — that is, issues that may affect voters in ways they are ashamed to admit. The civil rights question is one such issue. The rugged romantic appeal of the Goldwater image is another such example. Yet the election is only a week and a half away. The big — overall question is this: Can Barry Goldwater gain enough to offset the huge Johnson lead? Next week's THE DAVIDSONIAN will reveal the editor making his endorsement and a managing editor giving final prognostications. Check and see how close we are. Somebody's job could be at stake.

California: Crucial state in GOP campaign strategy. Militant conservatives feuding with moderate Republicans, plus poor big-city organizations, make Goldwater's chances slim. Best bet here is the Democratic lead has slipped, but that Johnson will still take the big forty electoral votes at stake.

Oregon: Despite sixteen years of going for Republican presidential candidates, this Northwestern state goes for LBJ by some fifty thousand votes.

Washington: There is economic discontent here, mostly caused by high unemployment. Johnson is ahead by a whisker.

Idaho: Here again battling GOP factions hurt Goldwater's chances, but there is much sentiment for the Arizonian. Give it to Goldwater by half a whisker and check next week's predictions.

Montana: Close race here, but a strong Mansfield showing helps pull Johnson through.

Wyoming: Another real close one, too close to make a prediction right now. A toss-up.

Nevada: No “Gamblers for Johnson” organization, but he is nonetheless considered a sure thing. Good government contracts make safe votes for Johnson.

Colorado: Independent vote is strong here. Goldwater probably won't attract enough of these voters to win — give this state to Johnson.

Arizona: Believe it or not, some observers think Johnson may carry the state. But though it may be closer than most people think, Goldwater will carry his home state.

New Mexico: Razor-thin margin for Johnson.

Alaska: After natural disasters in the spring, many Alaskans are going to be unwilling to follow up with a national disaster. Johnson by a landslide.

Hawaii: Easy victory for incumbent President.

Totals for the Northwestern and Rocky Mountain states:
Goldwater: 2 states with 9 electoral votes.
Johnson: 10 states with 83 electoral votes.
Toss-up: 1 state with 3 electoral votes.

After reading the above statement, we would expect to find evidence to support Senator Goldwater as a friend of the working man and trade unions. No such evidence exists. First, he has long supported “right-to-work” laws that state legislatures may enact under the Taft-Hartley law to ban union security contracts. During the last session of Congress, he went one better on this anti-labor position by proposing a law that would allow unions and employers to enter into union-shop contracts only where states adopt laws authorizing such pacts. Second, he favors a ban on union spending in politics. This is not hard to understand, coming from the man who in 1958 was named by organized labor as the senator it would most like to unseat. Third, he backed in the last Congress a bill to give the management of railroads unilateral authority to decide what manpower was “reasonable and needed.” Under the law, unions would have been unable to strike against such decisions. Their only source of redress would have been in the courts. Fourth, there is the Goldwater position on the application of anti-trust laws to labor unions. The senator’s vacillation on this issue should be sufficient to banish the idea that he never changes a position. Application of the anti-trust laws has been a niggling problem for Barry. In The Conscience of a Conservative, he supported bringing labor under anti-trust regulation. In 1958, he recanted from this position because he had decided that anti-trust application would be unworkable. During the last session of Congress, he made a second 180-degree shift on the issue when he sponsored a law that would apply the anti-trust laws to unions in the transportation field.

So much for Senator Goldwater and his undying devotion to his principles. We still do not plan to vote for him on Nov. 3. Because we won't be voting alone one month after the electorate has rendered its decision.
