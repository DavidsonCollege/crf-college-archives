4 THE DAVIDSONIAN NEWS TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 7, 1999

Students, Faculty, and Staff:

Welcome back to Richardson Stadium on Saturday, September 11, as college football returns to the new Stephen B. Smith Field inside the new Irwin Belk Track.

Here are some frequently asked questions about Davidson games and the new facility:

Question: Can students still get into the games free?

Answer: Yes. Students may gain admission to all Davidson games on campus via their ID card. To gain access to Richardson Stadium, students must enter through the card-reader at Duke Gate. Due to the configuration of the new public restrooms located in the West Tunnel, there will be no ID access through the Main Gate.

Question: Does this policy also allow Faculty and Staff to bring their families?

Answer: Yes. Faculty and Staff may gain admission for themselves plus one guest with their ID card. For larger families, it is advisable that the spouse and children over 12 apply for their own cards. As with students, Faculty and Staff must enter via the Duke Gate.

Question: When will we be able to use the track?

Answer: Very soon. At present, it is still a construction site. As soon as work is complete, the Belk Track will open for use by Davidson students, faculty, and staff when it is not in use by intercollegiate athletes. Joggers will be limited from running in the inside lanes.

Question: What is going on under the stadium?

Answer: At long last, through the generosity of interested and loyal alumni, we have been able to build new locker areas for the football team and the men’s soccer team, a dressing room for officials, and satellite space for Sports Medicine and our Equipment staff. Fans will appreciate the new public restrooms located in the West Tunnel near the Main Gate.

Question: Will there be any new Concession Stands?

Answer: The Lion’s Club will man the Main Concession Stand at the scoreboard end of the stadium along with the Souvenir Stand run by the Wildcat Cheerleaders. The Domino’s Pizza stand returns, but we have added a new Quizno’s Hot Sandwich Booth and we are presently negotiating with an Ice Cream vendor. Game Programs will be available both at the Main Gate and the Duke Gate.
