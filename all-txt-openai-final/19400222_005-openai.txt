by Henrietta Raymer. Patrol Two had their first course at Eva Griffith's home, their second course at the home of
Lucy Morrison, and their dessert at the home of Henrietta Raymer.

Ohio Wesleyan, Denison, Oberlin, and the University of Louisville. The topic of the current debate is “Resolved: that the United
