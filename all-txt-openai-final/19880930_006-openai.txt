es in the downtown area.” MAYOR, from page 4 Knox added, “But I cannot number one asset. We have an
outstanding relationship,” Knox said. “We mutually have had some problems in that the college had more students than they had
dormitories. I think that when the college finishes the parking lot at the sports complex, that’s going to make life
easier for us. We still have a lot of students who park their cars in the downtown area because that’s
one of the closest places, in some cases, to class. [The students] go to classes and stay all day. I
think that when that parking lot is available it’s probably going to be closer and therefore more students, more faculty,
more staff will use that parking lot and free up the desperate need for parking overemphasize how important the student
is to the life of this community.” He believes that the people of Davidson are a great asset, “I think
that we need to motivate more people to participate in public meetings when an issue is being presented to the
public.” As for the town’s future, Knox suggests that new projects such as the Pine’s of Davidson Retirement Center, the
construction of a walking mall, the building of a new town hall, and the careful development of a “gateway” along
the road from I-77 to the town seem to be the type of change Davidson has to look forward to.
And by the way, you can’t vote for the mayor this fall. The elections aren’t being held again until next
year. r \ ‘masterful | By FRANK LORD “Like Bonnie And Clyde themselves, the film rides off in all directions
and ends up full of holes.”--Time, August 25, 1967 “Bonnie and Clyde is not only the sleeper of the decade
but also, to a growing consensus of audiences and critics, the best movie of the year.”--Time, December 8, 1967 As
you may have noticed from these two quotes from Time magazine, Bonnie and Clyde received a somewhat equivocal reception upon
its initial release. Since then, however, it has established itself in

---the pantheon of classic American films. This film version of the story of the Barrow gang begins with the meeting
of Bonnie Parker (Faye Dunaway) and Clyde Barrow (Warren Beatty) and the start of both their emotional and criminal relationships.
It continues through their bank-robbing exploits, the formation of their gang, and their eventual downfall at the hands of the
civil authorities. The plot itself would seem to be fairly straightforward, but in the more than capable hands of Arthur
Penn, the director, it becomes much more than a simple just-the-facts documentary. Ultimately, it is a comment on America, its
people, and, more specifically, the manipulative power of film. At its best, Bonnie and Clyde is a tour de force
of audience manipulation. Penn begins his film by demonstrating that the two work by nothing more than a desire for
life on the edge. Though this lifestyle may be thoroughly despicable according to normal societal values, Penn crafts his film
in such a way that we, like so many of the bystanders in the movie, begin not only to identify
with them, but also to cheer for them, and eventually, to cry for them. This masterful manipulation of audience sympathy
is accomplished in a variety of ways, but none is more important than the point of view from which the
story is told. Only on a few, brief occasions does Penn take us out of the tiny world that Bonnie
and Clyde inhabit during their lengthy flight from justice. By keeping us in their claustrophobic world of tiny hotel rooms
and even tinier car interiors, Penn forces us to get to know his characters in a most intimate sense. Using
our intimate knowledge of the characters to his advantage, Penn manipulates our feelings about the characters until, in the end,
even though they are murderers, thieves, and fugitives from justice, we the audience cannot help but be saddened by their
betrayal and violent death. There are many elements of this film that cannot be considered even tangentially in a review
of this length. Audience manipulation is only one of the innumerable elements that make this film great. Go see it
and enjoy one of the best American films of the last twenty years. Bonnie and Clyde will be shown Saturday,
October 1, at 8 p.m. and again on Tuesday, October 4 at 9:45 p.m. in the 900 Room. Bring $1.50
for admission and your Davidson I.D.
