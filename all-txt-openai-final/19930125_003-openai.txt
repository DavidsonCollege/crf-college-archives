increased 613% in the last two
decades. William Brown com-
mented at the Senate meeting that,
“with inflation and especially the
tremendous increase in entertain-
ment costs, the Union Board is
limited in the programming possi-
bilities.” The tax increase for 1993-
1994 would increase the budget by
approximately $40,000. The Union
Board and the ATC hope that the

ing requirements without any
repercussions. The NCAA is clear
about the punishment for entire
athletic programs that fail to meet
requirements, but doesn’t deal with
the issue of individual sports that
fail to do so.

One thing seems fairly certain
at this point; regardless of classifi-
cation, Davidson will only con-
tinue to play football if it is against
a Division III schedule. The tre-
mendous travel expenses which
playing even cost-containment I-
AA football would entail would
make it impractical for Davidson.

additional funds would allow
Davidson to host larger name
speakers and musical groups.
After studying the policies of
twenty-six other colleges compa-
rable to Davidson, the Union Board
selected the one percent indicator
system used by Furman Univer-
sity. Several senators disagreed
that tuition is the suitable indica-
tor. Laura Cunningham, Senior
Class President, said, “the tuition
increases involve multiple operat-
ing expenses in addition to infla-
tion. The activities tax does not

Said Holland, “I cannot see any
circumstances, at this particular
time, under which I could recom-
mend [a return to true I-AA foot-
ball].”

Fortunately, the NCAA seems
committed to helping schools like
Davidson to maintain their foot-
ball programs at a manageable
level. “They are very oriented to-
ward trying to provide relief for
everybody,” Holland said. “A geo-
graphical waiver probably will be
what we will use to enable us to do
that. But at the same time, we don’t
have to use anything for a while.
The jury is still out, in spite of all
we’ve been through, as to whether
or not you can play unclassified

McWhorter said, “the one per-
cent indicator is somewhat arbi-
trary and we can always change it
later.” This week the SGA will
discuss the student proposal for
the tax increase with the adminis-
tration and the Finance, Personnel,

Wildcats to a 17-5-5 season that
included a final ranking of 16th,
the Southern Conference Tourna-
ment title, a first-ever NCAA Tour-
nament bid, and an amazing run to
the Tournament’s Final Four.
Slagle became one of eight
finalists for the award when he was
named South Region Coach of the
Year in December. He received
the same distinction in 1990, after
his team posted a 15-7-2 record
and finished the season 21st in the
country. Now 134-110-25 in his
13 years as coach at Davidson,
Slagle deflected the credit for the
award to his team.

“Obviously, mine is a team
award,” he said. “The guys lis-
tened to me as well as anybody’s
ever done, they worked as hard as
anybody I’ve ever had, plus they’re
more talented than anybody I’ve
ever had. That all paid off into
what I’ve got.”

Pat Millen, Davidson’s marketing and promotions director, said,
“Our long-term goal is to make Davidson to collegiate soccer what
Omaha is to collegiate baseball [the permanent host]. In our first year
hosting the tournament, we gave the NCAA some record-setting num-
bers, which backed up our assertion that the Carolinas is the number one
soccer area in the country. Long-term, I think the NCAA soccer cham-
pionships can grow to become second only to basketball in terms of
attendance.”
