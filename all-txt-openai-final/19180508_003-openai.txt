REVIEW OF LITERARY SOCIETY WORK OF YEAR

PHILANTHROPIC SOCIETY.

The Phi Society began the year under the guidance of J. A. Thames as president. The progress of the society
was somewhat hampered by the fact that no new members were taken in this term; the Junior society having come
into existence. Nevertheless, it was a very successful term. It was during this term that D. M. Chalmers, '20, won
the Fresh-Soph declaimer’s medal. Furthermore, the Phi’s have two Senior “Reps” to their credit in the persons of J. A.
Thames and J. L. Fowle.

J. L. Fowle succeeded next to the presiding chair and carried through a term filled with important events. It was
during this term that, due to R. E. McClure’s untiring efforts, the Phi Society was able to determine that it
had 66 men in the service of the country, in testimony of which there is now a service flag in
the hall.

Again, the Phi's furnished two men to the debating teams representing Davidson College in intercollegiate debates, and both of the
alternates.

The last term was in charge of J. W. Clark, and the following events transpired: The Fresh-Soph debating team of
the Phi Society overcame a similar team from the Eumenean Society, at which time D. M. Chalmers came off winner
of the debater’s medal among the Phi men. Again, the Junior-Senior debating team of the Phi’s defeated the Junior-Senior team
of the Eumenean, W. M. Currie winning the Philanthropic Junior-Senior debater’s medal, this being the third time consecutively that the
Phi’s have triumphed in the Junior-Senior debate. The three representatives are to be doubly honored in bringing the loving cup
to the society.

O. P. Hart was adjudged to have won the intra-society essay contest by a masterly essay.

EUMENEAN SOCIETY.

The college year just closing has been a very successful one for the Eumenean Literary Society. In the fall term,
the meetings were interrupted for a time because the hall was being repaired, but in the spring the meetings have
been regular and the work has been exceptionally good. The Eumenean Society lost to the Philanthropic Society both the Fresh-Soph
and Junior-Senior debates; but the loss of the last was probably due to the fact that its best debating talent
was on the inter-collegiate debating teams.

Of the five speakers in the inter-collegiate debates, three were Eumenean men.

Up to the present time, four medals have been awarded—the Fresh improvement medal, to J. R. Boulware, Jr.; the Fresh-Soph
debater’s medal, to Wm. Love; the Fresh-Soph declaimer’s medal, to W. B. Sullivan; the Junior-Senior debater’s medal, to L. M.
Thomas.

The society hall has been improved during the present year by the installation of a handsome indirect lighting system, and
the walls have been calcimined. A committee is now compiling a list of former members of the Eumenean Society now
in service, and a service flag will be secured as soon as this work is complete.
