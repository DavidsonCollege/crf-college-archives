Unless you really enjoy reading manuals, get a Macintosh.

Tim Moses

“Macintosh practically eliminates the need to keep manuals next to my computer, because—regardless of which program I'm using—I can open, close, save, and print files in exactly the same way. And you can't say that about any other computer.

“Today lots of other computers are attempting to look and work like a Macintosh, but it’s just not possible. They're too fundamentally different to begin with. This may sound a little strange, but comparing a Macintosh to other computers is like comparing apples to oranges. You can squash the orange into shape and paint it to look like an apple, but underneath the makeup, it’s still an orange.

“It’s funny—I work at the Vanderbilt computer store and I've seen lots of people switch from other computers to Macintosh, but I've never seen anybody with a Macintosh switch to another computer.”
