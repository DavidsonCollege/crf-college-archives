**Schizophrenia on the Rocks**

Drowning in this sea of immortality
I've decided to test my mortality.
The stage is set for the plot to unfold
And my pants are up, zipper zipped
I open the steel door to the cold
And pull on my hood, dirty and ripped.
One step, two steps, three
Gaining speed—going to bleed speed
My ankles in, then out then in;
My arms up then down then up.
I am a killer, a dangerous psycho
In an innocent, ignorant world
These people watch with eyes stretched
In terror, a haunted countenance now
Aware of their doomed existence.
No more cute rhyming for me,
I have transformed entirely.
I am...

the Iceskater from Hell.

It seems like I'm at it once again

The pain flowing through my veins and heart

Why must emotions always be antagonistic?

Can't you see I've fallen in love with you girl?

Sometimes I don't even know why I try

Everything just seems to stay the same

A person's efforts and feelings not spared at all

You hold the knife of words and use it

Sinking it into the deepest depths of my heart

Do you realize all the pain you're making me suffer?

All I ever asked of you was a chance

I could make you see that I am for real

Do you know what one-way emotions are like?

Have you ever felt the pain of unrequited emotion?

Did you ever have an unexpressable love and have nothing back?

Well let me tell you how it feels:

It's like a body of flesh in Purgatory’s flaming soul cells

No light and no way to save oneself from the burning pain

I'm falling like a drop of blood in the sea of life

This pit is endless and is dark as the caverns of my mind

I've been immaculately blessed and cursed by your presence

I'm so tired of this chase that there's no energy to breathe

I'm praying my body into eternal sleep along with this soul

So let's let this silver blade slice across into freedom

-Brian P. Healey '91
