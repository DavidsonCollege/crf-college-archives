FRIDAY, JANUARY 13, 1961 THE DAVIDSONIAN

A LOOK AT... | SPORTS By Bill Godwin

Three Happy Endings

AND WHO SAID this hasn't been a good year for Davidson teams? An All-American (see story below) and two pro
football draftees are proof enough for me that the Wildcats have been hitting on all cylinders. The latest news eked
out this week: All-Conference end Dan Whittle, following family tradition, will attend law school at SMU between seasons. Also, junior
center Tom Simpson has been drafted by the San Francisco 49’ers of the National Football League.

A Triple Treat

It’s one of the biggest sports bargains of the year, and tomorrow is. It may be your only chance to
see three sporting events on the Davidson campus the same day. All free of charge, mind you.

Actually, there are five events, when you add in two freshman contests. All the winter sports are included — basketball,
swimming, and wrestling. First off, there’s a wrestling match at 2 p.m. with the University of West Virginia. A frosh
meet, preceded by a tough one for the home team. Then, at 4 p.m. (just walk downstairs to the pool),
the Wildcat tankmen take on The Citadel Bulldogs. This meet will be a tough one for the home team. Finally,
Davidson’s freshman and varsity basketballers tangle with The Citadel at 6 and 8 p.m. These games will be tough ones
for the home teams. Which is all to say, there’s not a single pushover in the whole lot of them.
And that’s why the Wildcats will need your support.

AT RIGHT, ready to dive, are Tom Hudgins, Bill Whittington, Tom Dennis, Ken Kelley, Carter Mebane, Dick Fromm, Jim Moore,
Tom French, Bud Fry, and Stefan Young.

Sophs Find Range On Road

Letter List For 1960

A list of 30 letter winners shows what Coach Bill Dole meant when he said he'd try to use 28
or 29 players each game. Of the 30 lettermen, two dozen will return this fall. “It will give us the
finest nucleus of lettermen coming back since I've been here,” said Dole, who came to Davidson in 1952. “And there
are 10 to 12 rising sophomores who should help us tremendously.”

Thirteen lettermen are juniors, 10 sophomores, and seven seniors. Fifteen men received numerals for the first time. Three of them
— seniors Jennings Snider and Russ Cotten — earned their fourth letters last season. Four men are three-time letter winners:
Seniors John Crute, Scott Lacy, and Tee Redding, and Junior Bruce Usher. With two letters each are: Senior David Lovette,
Juniors Bill Shumaker, Lew Zirkle, Bill Whittington, and Bill Salzer; and Sophomores Dick Voorhees, Kent Tucker, Mickie Slaughter, Mike Owen,
Carl Hunt, Alex Gibbs, Eddie Crutchfield, Bob Cordle, Bill Bankhead, and Joe Ansley.

Claude Finney Picked As All-American Goalie

Claude Finney, senior soccer goalie from Spartanburg, S.C., has been selected to the 1960 All-American soccer squad. The announcement arrived
by mail last weekend and included an invitation to a national banquet for the 33-man team tomorrow. Finney said he
would not be able to attend, however.

This is his second post-season award, following his appointment to the All-South second soccer team in December. Left fullback Dick
Dalton and center forward Mike Laughlin were also named to the All-South team. Finney, a former “Wildcat of the Week,”
has made All-South for four straight years. He allowed only ten goals to the opposition last season as Davidson’s booters
ran up an 8-3 record, the best ever here. Coach Paul Marrotte retired on top.

Last night The Citadel added Davidson to its list of victims, including the University of Georgia, N.C. State, and North
Carolina. The Bulldogs roared to their fourth straight win, 25-3, in Johnston Gym. The Wildcats could cop only one event
— Cliff Thompson (177), the squad’s only senior, decisioned Bill Cunniff, 2-0. Davidson forfeited the 147-class and there was one
pin: Jim Reiney (HW) defeated Davidson’s John Eggers in 8:35.

In an exhibition match, Joe Jones of the Wildcats decisioned Frank Smith. As a result of the match, Thompson overtook
Tom Wright (123) and Ed Peel (130) in the Wildcat scoring race. He now has 14 points to their 12.
Harry Brown was narrowly beaten in the 167-class by Citadel’s John Doe in a 3-2 decision.

Tomorrow afternoon at 2, Davidson hits tough West Virginia, following a freshman match between the two schools.

Mounties And ‘Cats Grapple Tomorrow

The Citadel Bulldogs and the Mountaineers from West Virginia clashed here tonight in the second of three matches on campus
this weekend — what Coach Charlie Parker calls “Big Week.”

2-2 RECORD

What chances the ‘Cats might have for victory tomorrow were clearly expressed in their December match with the North Carolina
Tarheels. Davidson walked off with a 23-10 upset victory and now owns a 2-2 record. Both the Bulldogs and the
Mountaineers bring polished and stalwart teams to Davidson. West Virginia's matmen can boast of two Southern Conference champions, and The
Citadel is thus far undefeated.

BOOM FALLING

Says Parker, “I’m very well pleased with the team’s progress. But the boom is fixing to fall.” The Citadel, according
to him, is “tough — tougher'n nails.” Parker rates the Bulldogs as the tougher of the two visiting teams. He
stops short of any singling out of Wildcats for praise, saying, “Sure as I do, something’ll happen.” Davidson plays Emory
in Atlanta Feb. 3 for its first match following exams.

Tankmen Not In Top Shape For Citadel Contest Tomorrow

The Wildcat tankmen of Coach Dwight Shoe entertain The Citadel here tomorrow at 4 p.m. The ‘Cats will be swimming
against one of the Southern Conference’s best in the Bulldogs, but Davidson holds an impressive 3-1 record, following a meet
with William and Mary today. The visitors will feature a well-balanced team with excellent sprinters, and they will be favorites.
The frosh team will also make battle with The Citadel. The Catfish rookies have promising talent.Material in Dave Hollenbeck, Jim
Moore, and Bud Fry.

PLAYERS QUIT

But the frosh have been hurt with player losses, as almost half the team quit following the holidays. Leading the
varsity is captain Tom Hudgins, just recovering from a bout with the flu. Interviewed by The Davidsonian in the absence
of Coach Shoe, who attended the NCAA meeting early this week, Hudgins said, “The team as a whole is in
the worst condition for a meet. Swimming requires a lot of conditioning, and the team hasn't been able to get
ready since Christmas. Attendance at practice has been poor due to exams, reviews, sickness, and other hindrances.

POTENTIAL

“I feel we have in this team the potential to at least equal last year’s record of second in the
conference; however, we'll have to be willing to devote more time if we do it. We also need a responsible
manager. Coach Shoe’s been gone, and we've had a rough week. We were in good shape before Christmas, but the
situation is reversed completely now. I do believe, however, we'll be back in tune after the se-”

‘Cats Engage Cita Gridders Rate Soph Puts Life Into Basketball Team

6-1 guard Haywood Evans, 165, Wildcat basketball played a big part in Davidson's post-Christmas comeback. Evans is known by mates
as “Woody,” and by local basketball buffs as that trim, bespectacled sophomore who's been tearing up the baskets lately. Before
the holidays, Evans had only played in three games. You could count the minutes he'd played on your right hand.
On Dec. 29, with the ‘Cats in a six-game tailspin, he got his chance to start. Now, five games and
three Davidson victories later, Evans has nailed down a starting guard position and is leading the team in two vital
departments. He has hit 17 shots from the floor for a mark of .486. And he has missed only three
foul shots in 24 tries for an .875 percentage. That latter figure is just .007 below the 1957-58 average of
Semi Mintz, which was tops in the NCAA. Of course, Evans must toe the line many more times to qualify.

“We expect him to get even better,” Coach Lefty Driesell said this week. “He's not at his peak yet.” An
overly modest ballplayer, Evans says only that “the last four games have given us a lot of confidence.” At Rocky
Mount High School, he led his team in scoring for two years and rated All-Conference (at forward) for three years
running. Two games stand out in his high school career: a 30-point game against Kinston and the night he got
17 points playing opposite Wake Forest's great guard, Alley Hart. Playing regularly for Coach Joe Hunt last season, Evans hit
his peak in a game with Wingate Jr. College, scoring 24. He is valued for his defense as well as
for a most remarkable job of shooting.

Coach Lefty Driesell cited Evans’ recent surge as a main factor in the ‘Cats rejuvenated offense. The Rocky Mount sharpshooter,
undoubtedly the best shot on the team, hit five out of eight floor shots, and seven out of eight free
throws against the Fleet. He currently has a .486 field goal accuracy, and a fabulous free throw percentage of .875.
At that pace, Evans should certainly be among the nation’s top marksmen during his career at Davidson.

Driesell indicated that he was looking forward to tomorrow night’s game with The Citadel, the conference’s third-place team. He stated,
“A win over them will place us into a tie with Washington for fifth place. I would like to urge
all the students to come to the game since good support means so much to a team.”

DON'T MIND

The Citadel will be favored, but the Wildcats proved against Wake Forest and William and Mary that they don’t mind
being the underdog. The Bulldogs own a 9-4 record (4-1 in conference play), while the red-hot Davidsonians are now 4-8.
The Bulldogs’ starting five are well balanced and all are lettermen. Captain Dick Jones, a 6-2 guard, and Gary Daniels,
a 6-5 forward who is averaging 20 points plus per game, are the Cadets’ main sparkplugs. Jones scored 24 points
in Citadel’s one-point overtime victory over William and Mary Tuesday night.

HOME-STAND

The ‘Cats will be playing their last game until the second semester when they open a four-game home-stand, beginning with
Richmond on January 30, followed by Wofford on February 2, Pfeiffer on February 4, and VMI on February 6. In
the preliminary game, the frosh battle Citadel's Bullpups. The Wildkittens own a 2-4 record, but Coach Joe Hunt declared, “We
have been greatly handicapped by Bill Beerman's injury in our last three games (two losses to South Carolina and one
win over Wingate).” The freshmen are banking on 6-7 Terry Holland (leading scorer), Staff Warren, Lymon Dillon, Howard Arbuckle, Eddie
Earle, and Benny Coxton to lead them to victory.

Recruiting Underway

“We intend to have the best basketball material in the history of Davidson College in next year’s freshman class,” Coach
Lefty Driesell declared this week. Although basketball season is only half over, Driesell and his staff have been busy for
some time in their search for good basketball players. He currently has a .486 field goal accuracy, and a fabulous
free throw percentage of .875. At that pace, Evans should certainly be among the nation’s top marksmen during his career
at Davidson.
