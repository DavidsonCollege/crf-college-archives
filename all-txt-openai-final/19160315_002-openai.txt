SIMPLIFIED SPELLING

By a vote of the Staff, it was decided that simplified spelling would be used in The Davidsonian after this
issue. The entire list of the simplified words will not be used, at least at this time—but only the ones
which are coming into general use and which are now found in many of the leading national publications. The attitude
of almost everyone toward reformed spelling is that which is expressed by the President of the University of Minnesota, when
he says: “Intellectually I believe that simplification of our spelling is necessary; emotionally I rebel against the change.” We feel
that there is danger in trying to force this change too quickly—before the minds and eyes of a people are
ready for it, but now with several years of foundation work along this line, we feel that college students at
least should be ready to take the advance step and use the new spelling in their publications. No persons should
be more ready to adjust themselves to a necessary change. The simplified spelling is endorsed by leading educational authorities throughout
the country, as well as by men especially notable in practical affairs, and such is the weight of authority in
its favor that it must come into universal use eventually. We are glad to be an added agency in bringing
about this much-needed reform.

PHI SOCIETY HALL TO BE REPAIRED

A committee recently appointed by the president to improve the Phi Society has let the contract to J. R. Dunn
& Co., of Charlotte, interior decorators. The inside walls will be scraped and refilled, and when finished will be a
buff color. The ceiling will be white, while the woodwork inside and outside will be painted. The chandelier, which took
first prize at the first World's Exposition in Paris and was given to the society by an alumnus, will be
wired for electricity, which will add much to the attractiveness of the hall. The work is to begin at once.

J. G. Poole, from Mooresville, has just opened up a shoe repair shop below the Henderson House, where the market
of Mr. Gibbs was recently situated.

VARSITY BASEBALL WARMING UP

The prospects for a winning baseball team grow brighter each day, as Coach Fetzer, assisted by Coach Kluttz, put their
proteges through their daily paces at Sprunt Field. The indications are that the team this year will be composed of
speedy, fast-fielding players whose constant aim will be speed and then more speed. Daily drills in running the bases are
given the Varsity men with especial attention to development of speed and wind for the circuit run. The infield has
been working lately with Saunders, McKinnon, Wood, and Black, and this combination seems to have the “pep” necessary for a
Davidson infield. Hengeveld, Brown, and Walker have been playing the outfield positions. Burns is playing in the position of scrub
catcher, Faires first base, Johnson second, Boswell and Bill Keesler shortstop, and Younger third. Scrub outfielders are Sam Keesler, McAskill,
and Miller. A short six or seven-inning game is played every few days, to enable the men to get used
to real pitching, and to enable the pitchers to become accustomed to serving them up to real hitters.Son, Shaw, Monteith,
and Currie take turns dealing out the slants, and all seem to have a look-in for the Varsity jobs. Final
selection at this time is impossible for any position, but one thing is certain: Davidson is going to have an
able, speedy team this year.
