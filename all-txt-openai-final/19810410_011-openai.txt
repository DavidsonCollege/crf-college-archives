### PCC

(continued from page 1)

Davis are PCC officers in charge of working with proposals to change the self-selection system. Students are now technically free
to “self-select” into any eating house or fraternity. Wade will present a proposal to change to a two-tier system of
fraternity bids and computerized self-selection later this spring.

Seehorn said, “There are many pros and cons for the existing system and the bid system. We’re going to have
to examine other colleges of Davidson’s size that do have the bid system, and then evaluate the situation here.”

“We are dedicated to maintaining the open social atmosphere and the advantage of small group dining,” Seehorn said.

In addition to Seehorn, Wade, and Davis, PCC officers include chancellor Keith Hearle.

### Housing

(continued from page 1)

perimeter housing next year in order to increase the number of College-owned faculty housing units from 45 to 55. The
two new dormitories will compensate for the loss in perimeter student housing.

According to Currie, the major reason for the present housing shortage is that “the rate of retirement has been higher
than the rate of people getting their own homes.” This year there are ten professors leaving instead of the usual
three or four. Retiring professors usually keep their homes.

The College rents houses to some professors and also offers low-interest long-term loans to help those professors who want to
buy their own homes. Currie said that three professors bought their own homes this year, and he hopes more will
in the future.

He added that the current state of the economy makes it hard to buy houses. “This is a nobody’s market.
Hard to sell, hard to buy.”

Political Science Professor Louis Ortmayer suggested that the College make more loan money available to professors. He said that at
ten percent interest the College would receive a “better return than the Endowment, which gets less than nine percent.” He
added that the College “went out of its way” to provide him with a second mortgage, but that the College
unrealistically estimates average home costs and the amount of money professors can afford to spend on housing.

Sutton and Ortmayer agreed that affluent Charlotteans moving to the area are driving up home prices and forcing professors to
purchase houses farther from the College than in the past. Houses in the planned SYNCO development will start at $25,000.
Ortmayer thinks that prices are 20 to 30 percent lower outside of Davidson than in the town. Sutton recommended building
new duplexes and townhouses to help professors who are looking for homes.

Ortmayer also warned that the College may lose its close sense of community if professors live away from the College,
so it may be harder to recruit new faculty.

Several first-year professors who are currently renting college-owned houses praised Davidson’s system. English professor Cynthia Lewis said she is “very
satisfied” with her Concord Road house and that compared to the rent she was used to paying in Boston, the
rates the College charges are “very low.”

History professor Robin Barnes noted that the College was “very, very helpful” in finding him a house, and offered him
a choice of attractive places when he came. He said that the College maintains the house well and that the
rent was “very reasonable.”
