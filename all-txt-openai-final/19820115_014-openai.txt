Transpiration
on a Recital by J. Swisher

What is this music you are speaking of,
shaping with your hands?
Is it someone’s life story that you feel so keenly,
some state of agitation when you hammer the final tonic,
cheek a-twitch?

Perhaps it’s a wedding your head dances with your hands,
eyes and brow raised to lighten a touch,
Perhaps a bittersweet friendship when you caress a
dissonance.

There still you sit, recital-worn brow, to pounce
on a deep rumble,
with sometimes a grimace, some half-smile

Into whose soul are you piercing?
With whom do you plead remonstrate
with your eyes off in light-space?

Every nerve is filled with the thought
and the feelings
and the tension you build within.

It is not an old tale that you tell,
far removed in time and place,
Your present genius
understood every note of a passage,
left it to swirl, dissonant caught in time
and made of wood, strings, and ivory
a spirant — of you.
