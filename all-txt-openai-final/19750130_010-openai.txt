From the ice-chilled corners
of the Coliseum, affectionately
known to C.A. and Y.B. as a
“hole of holes,” we bring you
this week's semi-IMAC column
with a few facts, a lot of your
basic crud, and once again
some anti-semantic Davidson
humor.

First off, to get the crap out of
the way, there were several big
games last week, probably
most of which do not stick in our
paltry little minds. Now... if
C.A. will just... come over
here... instead of warming up
for those bush Blue Devils, we
can get on to things of greater
importance.

I Felta Thi has been granted
the services of Kirk ‘I gotta
shaft’ Combe, which certainly
makes them an IMAC power
along with the brilliance of the
ever-lovin’ Schmade. Supreme
Intelligence Bowie pardoned
Kirk on a great stroke of
wisdom and justice. After all,
IMAC is just fun despite the A
league.

In biggies this last week, the
Gozinyas showed they are the
best team in 4 years at least
here, as they trounced in every
conceivable way imaginable, a
good Delt 2 team by 25 points.
Stick had 24 and was
outrageous.

In other important contests,
the Tribe won Division #2 with
an 8-point win over Delt #1 54-48,
as Y.B. zeroed in for 32
markers.
SAE #1 defeated Pax 72-65 in a
closely fought battle as P pumped
in 26 to offset Dick (yes,
that’s my real name) Boehner’s
21 points and the Beach’s all-
around hustle. (Yes, Beach, we
finally said something nice
about you, I don’t know why
though.)

This wasn’t that important,
but the Delphi Bureau almost
shut out C-III for a half 49-1. In
the second half, the boys
loosened up and let ’em score to
win by only 80. C-III is ungodly
bad, as has been said. But soooo
bad?!

Well, so much for the scores
we remember, so on to the crud.
Despite the “Freek’s in-
timations,” we agree that the
Gozinyas are great and are
good bets to take it all... but not
without a scrap. The IMAC
tourney is usually worse than
the ACC: it is not who wins, it is

the beginning. Now we are in
there fighting, which will make
all the difference in the world.”

In that short comment,
Brickels has laid to rest the
claims that support for the
program is nonexistent.

And with that out of the way,
there is good reason to believe
that winning basketball can
return to Davidson, even if it is
not waiting on tomorrow’s door-
step.

who survives.

We would once again like to
compliment Bowie for his great
work in leading IMAC ac-
tivities. Back to normal, we
would like to condemn the Delts
for their bad-ass Spe-ish
behavior against the Gozinyas.
The game left a bad taste in a
lot of people’s mouths.

So, the winter tourney comes
up in about 1½ weeks and, if the
IMAC gets the gym as normal,
it should be finished by early
July... next year. Build a gym,
will ya Sam?

This column is really late
today, it’s Wednesday and the
paper comes out tomorrow, so
with Moses, Deaton, and Kennon
sweating their something-or-
others off, we will leave you
with the semi-forgettable words
of Ron Scott:

“You can fool some of the
students all the time and all of
the students some of the time,
but damn, you can feed them
anything and make a profit.”

Ooooh, that hurts right in the
ole soy bean bag. Pardon us
P.T. Barnum.

Until again, may our paths
bump in the john.
