LIFE IN HELL

You MAKE ME MISERABLE.

You'RE COMPLETELY INCONSIDERATE.

You EMBARRASS ME IN PUBLIC.

ALL YOU THINK OF IS YOURSELF.

YOUR HABITS ARE SLOVENLY.

YOU'RE OUT OF TOUCH WITH YOUR FEELINGS.

YOU'RE COLD AND UNFORGIVING.

ALL YOU DO IS NAG, NAG, NAG.

Hey Susie! Come on, Susie! What's up? You don't call. You don't write. You don't ever acknowledge my existence.

ENCOUNTERS OF SOME NOD Domestic Conflict

You hit on other women indiscriminately, drink to oblivion four nights a week.

And then you expect me to take your disgusting self back when you're out of luck and the floozies won't talk to you anymore because they've figured out you're a total... dweeb!

I'm not some piece of second-hand furniture and I'm not going to take it anymore!

Don't call me, Don't talk to me. Don't look at me! I'm through with you.

Hey, come on... what's the REAL reason?!
