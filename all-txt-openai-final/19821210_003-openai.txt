To the Editor:

I really appreciate your articles on the good and bad things on campus. I just wanted to tell you how
much I’ve enjoyed them. Especially the first article. I, too, have long been an appreciator of phallic symbols. I’m so
glad they’re so multitudinous here on campus, and to the creators of these marvelous erections I have but one thing
to say: “Keep it up, guys.”

Sincerely,
A Co-ed

P.S.—Newest phallic symbol for the holidays: E.T.’s finger. It even glows!

QUEST’S END

THE FUNERAL WAS A SIMPLE ONE. A FEW FRIENDS AND RELATIVES SAY “I’M SORRY” AND IT’S OVER. FOR THE SON,
A LAST WORD AND HE WILL BE GONE.

WHAT THE BOY, THE MAN, ADAM ROSS DOESN'T REALIZE IS THAT HIS LAST MOMENTS ARE NOT SPENT ALONE. HE IS
BEING WATCHED BY A WOMAN. A WOMAN WHO SHOULD BE AN OCEAN AWAY. A WOMAN FROM ADAM'S FATHER'S PAST--

To the Editor:

We would like to take this opportunity to alert everyone to the campus-wide clothing drive sponsored annually by Davidson Christian
Fellowship. The collection will begin immediately following Christmas break and will run from January 3 to 7. To ensure optimal
success for this cause we urge students to collect clothing from home during the holidays and then bring the clothes
back to Davidson. Students should deposit their clothing in appropriately marked boxes located in Vail Commons or their respective eating
houses. Faculty and staff members are encouraged to assist us in the clothing drive also, so there will be boxes
in Chambers building for their convenience.

The clothing collected this year will be donated to the Crisis Assistance Ministry of Charlotte. This organization will then distribute
them to the needy in Mecklenburg County and surrounding areas.

Our thanks go to all who will participate in this worthy cause.

Letters Policy

The Davidsonian welcomes letters from our readers. We try to print all letters that are of general interest, but we
adhere to these four guidelines:

1. We require that letters be in our hands by Tuesday 7 p.m.
2. We require that letters be neatly typed.
3. We require that letters be signed and include the author's phone number and address. If you have a compelling
reason for us to withhold your name, explain your situation to the editor, Stewart Cauley.
4. We reserve the right not to print letters that (a) function as advertisements; (b) contain innuendo, off-color slurs, or
inside jokes; (c) represent a viewpoint very similar to that expressed in many other letters printed on the same topic.
We also reserve the right to condense very long letters.

The Davidsonian does not in any way endorse the opinions expressed in the letters we print.
