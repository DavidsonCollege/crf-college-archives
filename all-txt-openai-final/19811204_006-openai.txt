### New Buildings

#### Sports Complex and Art Facility Next on Agenda in 1987 Program

Building a new sports complex and a new art facility are two of the next priorities of the College’s 1987 program. According to Vice President for Development Jack Powers, his department and College President Samuel Spencer are actively seeking donors to fund these buildings. The College will not have definite plans for the buildings until it finds donors.

Powers said, “We have several prospects of individuals who might give to the sports complex.” The 1987 program, done five years ago, estimated that it would cost somewhere around four million dollars to build a multi-sport complex. Although plans are not far enough along to say for sure, Powers estimates the cost today would be around five million dollars. The Physical Plant made a model of what the complex could look like in order to attract donors and presented it to the Parents’ Council last term. Powers said the design of the complex could include a series of separate units, or it could be an open facility similar to the Commons. He said that an open facility would afford a view of the whole complex from the entrance of the building, just as the Commons gives a view of its different areas at a glance. He said the complex might be built in phases as the Development Department raises money for each particular area. More areas would be added as more donors offered funds.

The complex would be used for intercollegiate and intramural activities as well as for recreation in general. The existing Johnston Gym was constructed about 33 years ago. At that time, the student body numbered 850 and was all male. The College now has grown to over 1300 students, including close to 500 women. Locker room space is cramped because of the size of the student body and because there now must be facilities for women in Johnston Gym.

Also, the pool is inadequate for competitive swimming and diving meets. The swim team holds its home meets at UNC-Charlotte. The new complex would solve these problems. Powers stressed that although donors have much control over design, “whatever is planned must be consistent with the College program.”

Powers said that some facilities that might be included in the complex are a floor for basketball and volleyball, a pool, paddle-ball courts, dressing rooms, indoor tennis courts, an indoor track, and an area for gymnastics. Powers said the College would probably build any new sports structures on the football practice fields beyond the football stadium and next to the soccer field.

Powers stated that both the sports complex and the arts building “are broadening influences as far as students are concerned.” The sports complex would afford better facilities for intramurals and relieve overcrowding in Johnston Gym, and the arts building would relieve overcrowding in the Cunningham Fine Arts building, as well as allow for a more diversified fine arts curriculum. The art building would not be a large facility because it would only need to accommodate four staff members and 50-100 students. The College is now looking for a possible location for the new building. Powers ruled out adding on to the existing Cunningham Fine Arts building because he said it would be impractical.

### College Bowl

#### Team Sets Sights for National Championship

Davidson has “the nation’s strongest College Bowl program,” College Bowl advisor Hansford Epes quoted an official of the recent CBS radio tournament in Chicago as saying.

The team, composed of juniors Brad Mullis, Marvin Overby, Gordon Turnbull, and sophomore John Eglin, won matches against Berry College and Purdue University. During the first match, Davidson’s team “fell behind badly” at first, but they “pulled it right out,” Epes said. The team, playing for the first time as the College team, “showed they could handle themselves in a match,” Epes added.

The team’s ultimate goal is, of course, to win the national tournament. There are two ways in which a team may qualify for the nationals. One is to be the champion of one of the 15 regions run through the college unions. The other is to win three consecutive matches at radio tournaments. The national committee, however, scheduled Davidson for only the last two matches of the tournament. The team cannot afford to go to the next tournament, which is in California. Beyond lack of funds, Epes said, “It’s the principle of the thing” since he had asked the national committee to not schedule only two matches for Davidson at the Chicago tournament. Nevertheless, Epes is almost certain that Davidson will be eligible for the nationals even if the team is not the regional champion. He said that last year the national committee needed to include teams which had won only two consecutive matches in order to fill empty slots in the national tournament.

This year’s team was selected through the intramural tournament and try-outs. During the intramurals, the faculty advisors and last year’s team chose about 30 individuals to try out for the team along with any other interested students. Epes said that this year’s tournament was proportionately “the biggest intramural tournament in the country.” About 12 percent of Davidson students played College Bowl this fall. The College Bowl program is sponsored by the College Union.
