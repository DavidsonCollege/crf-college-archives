**Davidson program destined for Africa**
By SARAH TEACHWORTH
Staff Writer

Davidson’s array of study-abroad programs will soon include a summer program in Ghana at the University of Cape Coast. Dr.
Nancy Fairley, Associate Professor of Anthropology and the Director of the West African Program, has been working with other devoted
individuals for over a year to institute the program. “I can’t tell you how excited I am,” she says. She
looks forward to meeting with interested students at an informational meeting this Wednesday.

The program will run for six weeks—from the end of May until the beginning of July. Over that period of
time, students will take one academic class entitled Contemporary Ghana four days per week. Each week, two afternoons will be
spent in either a music or a dance class. Volunteer work, such as tutoring in English or working at a
local women’s center, will fill up another afternoon.

To add to the Africa experience, students will not stay in dormitories, but with families associated with the University. They
will also have a “buddy” who matriculates at the University of Ghana and can introduce them to the ins and
outs of their school and community. Weekend excursions will also be an integral part of the program. Each weekend, students
will travel to different regions of Ghana and western Africa.

There are already two three-day weekend excursions planned. One will be to Cote D’Ivoire (formerly known as the Ivory Coast)
and the other to Burkina Faso. Even though not all of the details are decided at the moment, 15 students
will probably be allowed on the trip. Additionally, three or four alums may go. The trip is expected to take
place every other summer, but may...

Students say he doesn’t even explain rules about parties or subletting. They say Knox seems “laid-back” and “never complained” even
though a former resident admits that “we were not model tenants.” Two student renters believe Knox knew that they had
a cat temporarily, and he didn’t charge them the usual fee that was detailed in the lease for keeping pets.
Most tenants say he was even flexible about when they paid their rent. One contends that his rent only has
to be paid “somewhat on time.” Another remembers that Knox called him to remind him about his overdue check, but
Knox didn’t seem angry.

Knox is punctual in fulfilling his responsibilities as a landlord, making sure the lawns around the duplexes on Scherer Street
are mowed at least once a week (for no extra charge), and even reseeding and aerating lawns when needed. Still,
some have reported that Knox is hard to get in touch with and sometimes slow to respond to phone calls.
Most tenants describe that Knox is obviously committed to the upkeep of his houses, and also to upholding a friendly
relationship with his tenants. Knox states that one of his priorities is “getting along with folks.”

Many renters commented on his personality, stating that Knox is “soft-spoken,” “certainly nice,” and a “personable guy.” Tenants feel that
he does not take advantage of student renters. As one explained, “I think he’s a very fair, honest landlord, and
he’s someone you can deal with who treats you as a person, not as a college student.” Renters say he
even seems to have an interest in Davidson, to be “in touch with what’s going on on-campus and who’s who.”
Knox knows a great deal about the College, having grown up in Cornelius. He says he can relate to students
because “I think about days when I went to school and can reflect upon my experiences.”

Students who have rented from other Davidson landlords rate Knox as far and away the best. “Other landlords are so
horrible,” said one tenant. Another described Knox as a “saint compared to Marshall Case.” Knox says, “I just enjoy the
students a lot.” Most tenants report that they are satisfied with their experiences, including their relationship with him. One student
expressed enthusiastically, “He’s absolutely the best landlord.”Forum - from page 1

Commissioners make decisions which affect the college, hence students and government should develop a “mutual interest” in each other’s concerns.
At the forum, each candidate will have one and a half minutes to introduce himself or herself. Then each candidate
will be asked a different question, drawn randomly from a predetermined list, and given three minutes to respond. After each
candidate answers his or her question, the floor will be opened to other candidates’ responses for five minutes. SGA President
Bill Gullan will moderate, and Buford will be the timekeeper.

Sponsors who organized the forum worry about its time restriction. Williams stresses that since each candidate is given only a
limited time to speak, efforts must be made to ensure fairness in allowing each candidate to answer and respond. Buford
is optimistic that all will go “smoothly,” as candidates have been receptive to the idea of the forum. Of the
15 candidates running, 12 will be present at the function. Organizers stress this is a first step in bringing college
and community closer together. States Williams, “I hope the students get an idea of the importance of participation [in government]
... and make it their town.”

List of potential questions for local candidates:
1. In your opinion, should Downtown Davidson develop a comprehensive plan for desired occupancy, and should it be actively marketed,
or would you encourage a laissez-faire approach?
2. Do you think that creating “user-friendly” pedestrian sidewalks and bicycling paths throughout all of the town of Davidson is
a high priority? If so, how would you go about implementing them?
3. What, as a Town Commissioner, would you do to address the problem of drug and alcohol abuse in Davidson?
4. In your opinion, does Davidson have an obligation to its citizens to provide parks? If so, how do you
propose raising the necessary funds, and where would they be located?
5. Do you think that in order to sustain growth, Davidson will need a concurrent growth in business? What role
should students, and the Davidson College Community, play in deciding which businesses come to Davidson?
6. How do you feel about higher density housing as a way to promote lower home costs?
7. What steps do you feel should be taken immediately to reduce overcrowding in Davidson?

Davidson Summer Program in West Africa

Each summer, if interest is high, a course will be offered worth one Davidson credit, and is expected to cost
about $3,200, which will include room and board, tuition, and transportation both to and within Africa. Fairley and others have
been planning this program since the summer of 1994. Four faculty members, two administrators, and four students went on an
exploratory trip through three western African countries to see where the best possible program could be instituted. They decided on
Ghana. Since then, they have been working on finalizing the details of the program. The program was approved by the
faculty at their October 3 meeting.

Students interested in the Davidson Summer Program in West Africa are encouraged to attend the informational meeting this Wednesday, October
25, at 4 p.m. in the Conference Room of the Union. Trip organizers hope applications will be available by then.
If not, they will certainly be ready by the end of October and can be picked up at the Study
Abroad Office in Chambers. Completed applications will be due February 1.

Directories finally arrive

"This happens every year,” says Director of College Relations Jerry Stockdale. At this same time annually, students always call the
Union Desk for phone numbers because they have not received their own phone directories. Every student should have received his
or her directory by the end of this week, says Stockdale. As usual, he describes, the delay was due to
the difficulty of collecting all the information from the various areas of the campus.

Stockdale explains that although “we encounter unrest this time of year” as students begin to wonder if directories will ever
arrive, there is little that can be done to speed the process. “We could put the directory out earlier, but
it would be incomplete. We figure it’s better to have a full and accurate one a little later,” Stockdale states.
