THE DAVIDSONIAN, SEPTEMBER 21, 1932

SILVER SCREEN

Wednesday, Sept. 21—Make Me A Star—(Paramount)
Originally a story by Harry Leon Wilson and later a silent picture of a different name, this picture is still
good entertainment. Stuart Erwin (who seems to be the past master at the art of appearing befuddled) as the grocery
clerk who wants to get into the movies, goes to Hollywood and is finally accepted in a burlesque “western.” He
plays his role honestly and at the preview is so shocked to find that he has played the buffoon, that
he sets out for home and it requires all the skill of a blonde extra (Joan Blondell) to persuade him
to return. The whole story is full of those incidents that are somewhat pathetic yet which Erwin makes so funny.
Choice crack: When presenting Joan Blondell with a wristwatch, Erwin says: “It’s a little token of my esteem ... and
it’s guaranteed.”

Thursday, Sept. 22—What Price Hollywood—(RKO)
Another “inside” story of the activities of those concerned in the production of movies. Mary Evans (Constance Bennett), waitress and
cinema aspirant, waits on Director Carey so efficiently that she is given her chance to become an actress. After some
degree of success she marries a polo player (Neil Hamilton), so much to the displeasure of Director Carey that he
kills himself in her home. She is forced by this unjust scandal to run away to France where she is
found by her husband.

Friday, Sept. 23—Downstairs—(M-G-M)
Some of the best work Jack Gilbert has done in a long time is in this story written by himself.
Included in the activities of his vocation as a chauffeur and his occupation as a Beau Brummell, there are plenty
of episodes in which the Gilbert talent shows to best advantage.

Saturday, Sept. 24—Devil and the Deep—(Paramount)
Charles Laughton’s acting, in his first U.S. cinema, as the jealous and crazed commander of a submarine, seems to have
quite stolen the show from the supposed stars. In fact, so brilliantly is Laughton’s portrayal of the morbidly jealous husband
that in contrast the hair-raising experiences of Tallulah Bankhead (his wife) and Gary Cooper in a sunken submarine seem almost
tame, and the main plot, a romance between Bankhead and Cooper, seems almost unessential. Highly recommended.

Monday, Sept. 26—Bird of Paradise—(RKO)
A group of American travelers land at Tahiti in the Hawaiian Islands and one of them (Joel McCrea) stays to
make love to a native princess; he abducts her and they live together happily in a native mansion which he
builds. Complications follow, however. Despite the somewhat hackneyed plot of a white man and native princess and the assumption that
if a picture has a volcano it has very little else, there is really some good acting, fine photography, and
many beautiful settings in this picture. The production is said to have cost $1,000,000.

Tuesday, Sept. 27—Unashamed—(M-G-M)
This picture is based on a recent sensational murder case in Philadelphia. In his attempt to secure marriage with Helen
Twelvetrees, a three-million-dollar heiress, Monroe Oursley takes her to a hotel overnight and in the morning confronts her father and
brother, almost distracted after a night...of searching. In the fight, the brother kills Oursley. After all other efforts to save
the brother from the electric chair have failed, Twelvetrees turns and saves her brother by drawing on herself the ire
of the jury, abandoning her own pride and honor, and depicting herself as devoid of emotion of any kind. Prosecutor
John Miljan’s jeering speech on the “unwritten law” is unusual.

Synod Attended by Members of Faculty

The Synod of North Carolina met in its regular session at Greenville Tuesday evening, September 20. Davidson was represented at
this meeting by Dr. Walter L. Lingle, Dr. Thomas W. Lingle, Dr. C. R. Harding, and Dr. H. M. Moffett.
Due to the arrangements of Rev. R. E. McClure, of New Bern, there was also a banquet for alumni of
Davidson College in Greenville. At this meeting, Dr. W. L. Lingle presided as toastmaster. Addresses were given by Dr. W.
Harding and Dr. T. Lingle. This alumni banquet was not only attended by representatives at the Synod session but by
alumni of the surrounding region.

President Walter Lingle has other engagements to make addresses in the near future. He will speak next Sunday, September 25,
at the A. R. P. Tabernacle in Charlotte, of which Dr. Ernest Orr is pastor. On October 4, Dr. Lingle
is scheduled to address the Federation of Woman's Clubs which will be in session at that time in Mount Airy.

Tobaccos made for cigarettes and pipes; granulated tobaccos. But there was plenty of room for a tobacco made solely for
pipes. If you look, you will find that a great many tobacco packages say “for pipe and cigarettes.” But the
Granger package says: GRANGER ROUGH CUT Pipe Tobacco. Granger is made by Wellman’s Method and cut right for pipes—rough cut.
Burns slower and cooler. Just try it! YOU CAN DEPEND ON A LIGGETT & MYERS PRODUCT.
