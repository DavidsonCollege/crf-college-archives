The Importance of Davidson's Past

By Marc Overcash

Have you ever, whether by purpose or chance, wandered about the second floor of Little Library? There, towards the side that faces Duke, dwell the cloistered carrels of professors, a big green sign warding off potential trespassers [thou shalt not study here!], the office of the Archivist, and picturesâ€”pictures that echo back the past.

No, these cryogenic gazes do not implore you to seize the day, but rather to remember the past. We come here in hope, among other things, to earn a degree that bears the name Davidson College. However, so few of us know the past traditions that make this name so valuable that we spend over sixty thousand of our dollars and four years of our lives. So few of us, besides those in the chorus, know the present Alma Mater song or even the original. Do we not care? Is Davidson just a means to an end, not the community of fellowship we say it to be?

Sorry, I was not trying to write a David Thompson opinion, but rather an introduction, or perhaps a justification, to a series of articles I plan to write. I realize that these stories will not yoke the present to the past, nor will they serve to stir our sense of tradition. After all, these are just words. But for those who choose to read, I offer these stories, not as a lesson in Davidson lore, but as a piece of history that we all share. I offer writing that weaves these different strands of Davidson together instead of stretching them apart.

...not help your hangover. If some time has passed, aspirin is helpful as it thins the blood.

3. A better prevention is three 100mg complex vitamins taken one at a time: firstly well before you plan on drinking, secondly just before drinking, and lastly just before going to bed.

4. If you have a hangover, take them one at a time every 2-3 hours.

5. You should eat before drinking.
