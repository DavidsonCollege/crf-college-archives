THE LITTLE DAVIDSONIAN
‘All the news, more or less!’

WEDNESDAY & THE WEEKEND

WEDNESDAY NIGHT—
First Come, First Served

The Weekly Wednesday Interlude will take place in various points of the Union tonight at 9:00 p.m. THE CUISINE WILL
INCLUDE CHICKEN SALAD SANDWICHES, POTATO CHIPS, AND COKES. For the gourmet, the famous David Ovens College Union Roquefort Sauce will
be prepared for your potato chips and taste buds.

By special arrangement, PING PONG AND BILLIARDS WILL BE FREE DURING THE BREAK. Socializing will include bridge, shuffleboard, and dancing.
Girls have been invited.

All commodities on a first come, first served basis. Consequently, be at the Union at nine sharp for some unionized
fun and food.

FRIDAY—
Not such a Good Friday: Science Exams

FRIDAY & SATURDAY NIGHT—
"Tap Roots", Susan Hayward, Technicolor

TAP ROOTS is almost super-colossal from any angle; it's from the best-selling novel by the late James Street; the almost
late Susan Hayward is adequate from any angle; the symbolism of the tap roots; the technicolored picture of Antebellum Dixie.

We might even suggest that TAP ROOTS is a poor man's GONE WITH THE WIND, but that phrase was used
(and plagiarized by the Union sign maker) last week by this writer, and we can't be (come) trite.

TAP ROOTS is worth both your time and your money, but leave the latter behind, for it's FREE both Friday
and Saturday nights at 9:00 p.m.

SUNDAY—
"S" Raised to the Seventh Power

With exams for many this following Wednesday, you may find yourself on the hill this Sunday. In case such an
event should occur, you might heed the helpful hints offered below for this SUNDAY:

TIME SACK until late in the morning (10 or so)
SWIM in General William Lee Davidson's Own Catawba
SNOOZE a little, irregardless
SMORGASBORD at the Union—it's great!
SOUTHERN, Anno; (Private Secretary) 6:30 p.m.
SULLIVAN, Ed; also on TV 7:00 p.m.
STUDENT SONG SERVICE 7:30 p.m.

The views represented here do not necessarily reflect those of our sponsor for a sinless, sexless, and safe Sunday, but
you shall find it a satisfactory Sunday solution. It is safe to suggest that the General Assembly supports the Student
Song Service. SEE YOU THERE.

CONFIDENTIAL
"the good ole days"

DEAR DAVIDSONIANS:

WE CERTAINLY FOUND OUT WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO BE IN A SIDE SHOW THE FIRST WEEK WE WERE AT
DAVIDSON. BUT THOSE WERE THE "GOOD OLE DAYS."

ASIDE FROM BIOLOGY AND HISTORY, WE REALLY DO LIKE DAVIDSON—IN FACT, WE THINK THAT IT'S GREAT. CONFIDENTIALLY, WE HAVEN'T OPENED
ONE DOOR SINCE WE STEPPED FOOT ON THE CAMPUS—AND YOU CAN BELIEVE THAT'S A RECORD.

WE'VE GOT ONE COMPLAINT THOUGH!—THOSE 8 O'CLOCK CLASSES—WHEW, WHY DON'T THEY START THOSE THINGS AROUND 12:00?

THE UNION SEEMS TO BE OUR FAVORITE HANGOUT (EVEN IF THERE ARE FLIES IN THE VINEGAR). AFTER TWO WEEKS, WE
DECIDED TO CHANGE OUR MAJORS TO POOL, PING-PONG, AND BRIDGE.

THANKS A LOT, EVERYBODY, FOR BEING SO NICE TO US.

SEE YOU AROUND THE CAMPUS,
Lynne & Sarah
