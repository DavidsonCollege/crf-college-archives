**Three Professors Will Not Return Next Year**

Several professors already know that they won’t be returning to Davidson next year. English Professor Ann McMillan and Humanity Professor Pat Edmondson did not have their contracts renewed for next year. Art Professor Melinda Lesher resigned to do independent research. All three professors should finish the year.

The College is creating a new position in the political science department using funds from a Mellon Foundation grant, according to Dean of Academic Affairs T.C. Price Zimmermann. The new professor will also teach half-time in the Humanities program. Despite the recommendation of the Humanities Department, the College decided to make an offer to another candidate for the position. The candidate has turned down the College’s offer, and the political science department is considering other applications.

Prof. Edmondson did not yet know what she would be doing next year, though she is considering law school. “I don’t intend to sit on a shelf,” she said. Her husband, Prof. Earl Edmondson, is a tenured professor of history.

Prof. McMillan declined to comment on or confirm her non-renewal. She has another year left on her contract and could return next year.

There are also several visiting professors who do not expect to be teaching at Davidson next year. The College will decide later on an individual basis whether to offer them another visiting or assistant professorship.

David Shi smiles proudly about his book, *Matthew Josephson, Bourgeois Bohemian*, because it was nominated for a Pulitzer prize. Yale University Press, Shi’s publisher, was responsible for the nomination.

The College Bowl intramural competition ended last Tuesday, January 11, with a double elimination tournament between STUD and I PHELTA THI. Senior STUDs Andy Brown, Jim Cheek, Bob Trobich, and Rob Gillson entered the fray with a 5-0 record, losing their first match of the season to the freshmen team 140-205. Rob Gillson credited the loss to poor response to bonus questions. STUD rallied in the second match to beat Ross Hoit, Bob Loper, Rod Molinare, and John Laughlin 235-150. In addition, STUD members Andy Brown and Bob Trobich and I PHELTA THI’s Ross Hoit were awarded All-Star status. The All-Star team also includes Tim Wamples (Beef Trust) and Will Berson (NOLO CONTENDRER).

On Friday, January 8, the last of the $2300 embezzled from a campus organization was returned. The student responsible for the embezzling paid the balance in the form of a check for $115.

This week the College Union sponsored a “Scarce World Resources Symposium.” The schedule of events included an open discussion about United States resources and a taped presentation concerning nuclear emergency on Tuesday; an open luncheon featuring a look at population growth on Wednesday.

**SGA Now Delivering Campus Mail**

The SGA began a program this fall to deliver mail on campus for no postage fee. According to SGA Vice-President Chip Hurley, the system “has worked really well since Thanksgiving.” Averaging sixty pieces a day, the service is open to students, faculty, and administration.

Chip picks up the mail daily at 3:00 p.m. from the mailbox located in the faculty mail room. This is part of his work-study job. He then delivers the mail to dorm rooms and offices on campus. The mail must be in envelopes with the recipient’s name, building, and room number. Chip asked that the sender include his return address.

The service does not deliver to Patterson Court, perimeter, or off-campus housing. Chip asked for suggestions from students to improve the system. He encouraged students and faculty to use the service.
