TO THE VISITORS

The class of ’29 feels greatly honored to have as its visitors for the weekend such a gathering of “Southern beauties” as now bedeck the calm and stately campus of old Davidson. The class deems it a rare privilege to entertain such visitors, and wishes for them a most enjoyable stay over the weekend. This is the first time the junior entertainments have been held at a time outside of the spring holidays, and the number of visitors as well as students who are witnessing the affairs seem to voice approval of the new plan.

There has been much criticism of the social life, or rather the lack of social life at Davidson during the past few years, but judging from the visitors who are favoring the campus with their presence this weekend, we may correctly say that the infrequency of such visits is made up for by the quality as well as the quantity of the visitors when such an affair does come off. The green of the campus is refreshing to the eyes in the springtime without any added adornment, but its beauty this weekend is due to more than the verdant carpet laid for the occasion by Mother Nature. The author of that famous saying about a young man’s fancy in the springtime, if he could visit the fair city of Davidson during this weekend would in all probability receive enough inspiration to issue another statement which would in time become equally as famous as the one quoted above. The moon has not lent its aid to the young man’s fancy on this occasion, however. Perhaps the old man felt his shortcomings in the presence of such fair company and decided to save his energy for a later date. Here’s to the guests of ’29! May their visit be an enjoyable one and one which will long remain in their memory!

THE NEW PLAN

As mentioned in the above article, the Junior class has been rather severely criticized in several instances for changing the plans for Junior Speaking from what they have been for the past several years to the program which is being put on by the class of ’29 this weekend. It seems that some of those who are most severely criticizing this action are the very ones who were strongest in their criticism of the old plan. This, however, is no more than might have been expected. The present plan is certainly far more economical. The critics of this plan must certainly admit this. The expenses of last year’s program and of the several preceding years amounted to very near one thousand dollars a year, which meant eight or ten dollars out of the pocket of each individual man. The main expense, that of decorating for the Saturday night program, will amount to only a fraction of the cost of this cabaret program, and will serve the purpose equally as well. The cost of printing the usual copy of “Sanity Rare” will also be done away with. The twelve-page issue of the Davidsonian, due to the excellent work of its business staff, will entirely pay for itself without outside aid.

On the other hand, the new plan of having this entertainment at a time other than the holidays gives a much larger number of the students, and others as well, a chance to enjoy it. It is true that several of the students stayed during the holidays to enjoy the festivities under the old plan, but there will be many more present under the new plan and the affair will consequently be more democratic. The added stress which is being placed on the Junior oratoricals, and the Junior minstrel and reception also, make the affair truly a Junior production. The Junior class feels that it has made a step forward in breaking away from the old custom. The reasons cited above and several others which could be given all go to prove that the move is for the best interests of all concerned. Perhaps the new plan is not perfect. It would be unnatural and quite extraordinary if it were. However, the new plan is certainly better than the old, and, until a better one can be worked out, let its critics either cease their criticism or make it of such a nature that it will be constructive and conducive to a better plan rather than entirely destructive.

Collegiate Comment

When M. Claudet, French ambassador, visited The Citadel and termed it “The West Point of the South,” V. M. I. rose in righteous indignation that anyone should take their own slogan away from them. “M. Claudet will not be taken seriously in his comparison,” because a statement made by General Pershing several years ago, “indicates without a doubt that V. M. I. is second only to West Point,” according to The Cadet.

In the P. C. Blue Stocking there appears a list of nominations for student body officers and the statement appears parenthetically that they have been “approved by the faculty.” Just what they have to do to gain the approval we don’t know but it must make the profs feel more important.

At Penn they try to explain the origin of the painted slickers. They say that the first decorated rain-protector came by its honors quite accidentally when a collegian returning from a victorious football game was slapped on the back by another student whose print of a muddy hand stood out clearly on the slicker. The rest of the mob saw him and adopted the fad.

Several of the college papers are denouncing ludicrous misrepresentation of college life as shown in the movies. A petition asking for true dramatization of college life or none at all was signed by the sophomore class of Princeton.

The Emory Wheel states that according to a letter recently received by the manager of the Glee Club’s European tour, the “South’s Sweetest Singers” will have luncheon and an afternoon date with Lady Nancy Astor while in Europe next summer.

The William and Mary Flat Hat is advocating the proposition that no man be pledged by a social fraternity until his sophomore year because “many men become dissatisfied and are later sorry for their decisions. The fraternities would be better able to determine what type of man they are getting, and would be better able to determine his worth,” they opine.

One of the big features of the year at Union University, Jackson, Tenn., is a steamboat excursion up the Mississippi in which about 1,200 students participate. This is to take place on the last Saturday of this month.

N. C. C. W. girls selected Governor Al Smith over Secretary Hoover in a recent straw vote conducted by The Carolinian. The faculty preferenceWent for Smith by a two-vote decision, and the student vote gave the governor a lead of 214. Something along the line of Honors Courses has been adopted at Randolph-Macon, granting optional attendance upon classes to those who have made high grades and shown exceptional interest in their work. In place of the conventional routine, their work will be confined to intensive research.

### Leaders Of '29
**BOB KELL**  
**BOB COVINGTON**

The above group shows the men whom the class of '29 has chosen to lead the class through its four-year sojourn at Davidson. These men have proven themselves able and capable of handling the affairs of the class as they should be handled, and the class has passed three prosperous and active years under their guidance. The presidency of the class carries with it membership on the Student Council, and the position is one of honor and responsibility in every respect. Each of the above four men was recently elected to membership in Omicron Delta Kappa, and each of them has attained success in some special phase or phases of campus life.

The first president of the class, in 1925-26, was Bob Covington. Bob is from Raeford, N.C., and has been prominent in campus affairs since his entrance as a freshman. He was a member of the freshman football team and has been a member of the varsity squad for two years. In his first year, he was a member of the baseball squad. Bob’s main activity, however, has been in the way of literary work, leading up to his election to the editorship of the Quips and Cranks during the recent student body elections. Bob has been active in Y.M.C.A. work and has recently been appointed to the new cabinet to take charge of the Vocational Guidance part of the Y work. He has also been a contributor to the Chameleon and other campus publications.

Bob Kell, from Pascagoula, Miss., was chosen to lead the class during its second year, and his year at the head of the class proved to be one of activity and accomplishment for the class. Bob has been especially active in campus activities as well as in his class work. His popularity is shown by his recent election to the presidency of the student body, the highest honor which the students can bestow on a fellow student. His part in the athletic life of the campus has also been prominent. He has played football each of his three years here and promises to be one of the mainstays of the team next year. He has also been one of the large scorers on the Wildcat track team. He can be counted on for several points in each meet and is usually among those who carry off first honors. Bob has also been prominent in the field of forensic work. He is a varsity debater and a speaker of no mean ability. He has been a valuable and consistent Y worker, has done much work with the boys of the town, and is a member of the new Y cabinet. The members of the student body are looking forward to a prosperous year under his leadership.

Mac King has been at the head of the class for the past year, one of the busiest years the class has spent. Mac is from Bristol, Va.-Tenn., and has set a high standard for those from his part of the country while here. He has been a member of the varsity football squad for two years and was a member of the freshman team during his freshman year. Mac has been a leader in Literary Society and Y work. He was recently elected to membership in Omicron Delta Kappa and also to the Student Council for next year. He is prominent in R.O.T.C. work and is a member of the Glee Club. Mac has also been a member of the Court of Control and is prominent in other campus activities.

The fourth president of '29 is also a prominent man on the campus. Monroe T. Gilmore, of Wilmington, N.C., was elected to lead the class through its senior year at a recent meeting. Monroe has been prominent in several lines of activity while at Davidson. He has worked for three years on the Annual, was a member of the varsity basketball squad, and has taken an active part in class work for three years. He has also been prominent in Y work and has been chosen to fill a position on the new Y cabinet. He was elected to membership in Omicron Delta Kappa at its recent election. As the student body is looking forward to a prosperous year under Bob Kell, so the class of '29 is looking forward to a prosperous year under the leadership of Monroe.

### Junior Talent

**LINES TO A CAPTOR**

By the hair that shames the sheen of gold,  
By the lips that tempt with their carmine hue,  
By the eyes that hold me a serf for life,  
I charge you hear my confession true.  
Your beauty’s a net in whose toils of gold,  
My soul is advertently ensnared,  
A willing captive in heart and soul,  
Ah, glorious fate—if you only cared.  
Yet you have no tear for my hapless plight,  
The heart that’s within you has turned to stone.  
Won't you cool my brow with one kindly look?  
Can I live on when my hope is gone?  
Still I with the grief of a bootless hope,  
Must yearn and strive for the mark I’ve set,  
For deep in my soul there’s a doleful shame—  
Presumptuous I am that I cumber your net.  
—J.R.C.

**LOVE AS IS**

Now, the cave-man in courting his lady fair,  
Used methods which we of today would call rude.  
With a hand on his club, and a hand in her hair,  
With passion and amor he forcefully wooed.  
But really, was that so remarkably crude?  
And the knight-errant, clad in his glittering mail,  
Did battle full nobly and shed his red blood,  
And he conquered in love where a modern would fail—  
But why not? I think that he certainly should.  
Indeed, I should try that if only I could!  
That was all very well, but in times such as these,  
With Romance and Chivalry dying in men,  
No longer a club or a lance I may seize,  
So I woo my fair lady with Waterman Pen—  
Yes, I make all my love with a pen!  
—W.B.M.

**QUESTION**

I questioned Science how this life began,  
And what should be the final end of all:  
How born and how composed this whirling ball,  
And what made up the glorious whole of Man.  
To which reply came as a hollow roar:  
“A blind, brute destiny works out its will  
On vital dust that quivers—and is still;  
There all begins and ends, and nothing more.  
As molten metal shapes the dumb machine,  
So from dead earth are molded beast and man,  
Created by main force, no trace of plan,  
Built by caprice of fate, all unforeseen.  
There is no afterworld of bliss or shame;  
Man’s birth is but to energize the clay;  
In death the energy is passed away,  
From matter to the void from whence it came.”  
The voice was mute; a shadow seemed to fall  
Across my soul, that could not understand  
How men who see a universe unplanned  
Profess to find in Science all in all!  
—Frank Hall.

**ANOTHER CONFESSION**

Long in silent admiration I have watched you on the sly,  
And my heart in wild upheaval,  
Bounds my chest when you are nigh.  
For you're fair and sweet and tender,  
And I’ll get you if I can,  
But I’m torn with stern misgivings,  
For I am no “ladies’ man.”  
How my heart grows faint within me,  
As I see you there beset,  
By the polished, blasé legions  
Of the cultured younger set.  
Could I talk so smoothly, blandly,  
As those idle young men can,  
I might dare to try to take you,  
But I am no “ladies’ man.”  
Other men may feel your presence,  
See your beauty—hear your voice,  
And feel not the least embarrassed,  
But for me there is no choice.  
Just the knowledge of your nearness,  
Just the pressure of your hand,  
Makes me red, confused and speechless,  
For I am no “ladies’ man.”  
So it is—in halting verses  
I am trying here to show  
My affection, unavowed yet,  
But you've sensed it, dear, I know.  
I have one last hope to cling to,  
I'll believe it while I can.  
Could it be, by any chance, dear,  
You don’t want a “ladies’ man.”  
—J.R. Covington.
