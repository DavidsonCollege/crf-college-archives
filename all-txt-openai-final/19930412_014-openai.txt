**Baseball Hangs Tough Against 8th Ranked Georgia Tech**

By Will Cobb

The Davidson baseball team bounced back from a four-game losing streak to play some of its best baseball. Despite suffering two lopsided losses (6-1 and 9-0) to East Tennessee State, the ‘Cats returned the following day to capture the third and final game of the series by piling up 16 hits in a 7-3 victory. Chris Carrigan (3-3) took the win while giving up only one walk through 90 pitches. “Chris pitched about as well as he has all season,” said Coach Dick Cooke. Clay Hall worked the last 1 2/3 innings to pick up his third save of the year. Freshman Jeff Andrews led the offense by going 3 for 4, bringing his average to .371 on the season while Tim Kerns tacked on two more RBIs while going 2 for 4 on the afternoon. This victory upped the team’s conference record to 4-7, and gave the team needed confidence going into their next game versus Georgia Tech.

The ‘Cats then traveled to Atlanta to face the number eighth ranked Georgia Tech. This team was by far the toughest they had faced all year long, but that did not prevent Davidson from producing one of its most solid performances of the season. Davidson jumped on Tech quick in the first inning by going up 3-0. The 'Cats were able to hold this lead until the sixth inning, when Tech captured a 4-3 lead. Davidson answered in the seventh, tying the game at four when Kerns drove in Bender. Unfortunately, Tech went up 5-4 in the bottom of the seventh and added an insurance run in the eighth to leave the game’s final score as a 6-4 loss. Sophomore Mills Arial was given the start and he delivered. Arial pitched five innings while giving up only three runs, one of which was left on base when he left the game, while striking out the highest-rated catcher in college baseball. For the offense, Kerns led the team, going 3 for 4 with two doubles and two RBIs. Bender, the school's all-time at-bat leader, went 2 for 5 as catcher Brett Borretti went 1 for 2 with an RBI double. Though it was a loss, it was a great all-around team effort.

The team went back to Southern Conference action, facing a solid Furman ballclub last weekend on the road. On Saturday, the ‘Cats pulled off their first doubleheader sweep of the season by defeating Furman 11-7 and 7-5. Mac Chapman picked up his first two victories on the mound for the season by taking both wins. In the first game, Hall led the attack with a perfect game at the plate, going 4 for 4 with three RBIs. Bender took a big step closer to the school record for hits by going 4 for 5 while Borretti made another solid performance with 3 for 5 hitting. In the second game, Chapman helped himself out at the plate as well by cranking the ball over the fence for a two-run homer that served as the game-winner. Brett Borretti had two home runs of his own while going 3 for 4 at the plate, hitting .667 for the day. These two victories bring the team’s record to 11-19 on the season with a 6-7 conference record. The ‘Cats played the final game of the series yesterday and face Wake Forest at home on Tuesday at 3:00 and Duke at home on Friday.

**Men's Track Takes Huge Strides to Records**

By Peter Hurtado

Davidson now has a “Fab-5” of its own. The men’s track and field team had its finest day in recent memory this past Friday at the Duke Invitational, as Ian Stewart, David Kerns, Peter Hurtado, Erik McMichael, and Duncan Spears added to the school’s rich track history. The distance medley relay squad of Hurtado, Spears, McMichael, and Kerns smashed a 28-year-old school record by a huge margin of 12 seconds, placing eighth overall at 10:10.3. Hurtado paced the Wildcats with a 1200m time of 3:05.6 (six seconds faster than his personal best); Spears took the baton and hammered an unbelievable 48.6 400m split, almost two seconds better than his best. McMichael then kept the ‘Cats in position with the best 800m (1:57.2) split of his career, and then the three stood in amazement as Kerns brought the record home with a lightning mile of 4:18.6. An excited but bewildered Coach Gary Andrew called the race “the finest relay effort, of any distance, ever at Davidson College.”

Thirty minutes later, Stewart stole the show. Once again, Davidson’s fans stood in amazement as Stewart went out fast and held the grueling pace (9:40 2-mile) to run an unbelievable 5000m time of 15:11.7. This is the third fastest ever by a Davidson athlete, and certainly ranks Stewart among the best distance runners ever produced by Davidson. The phenomenal performances did not end on Friday. Joe Beach clocked a personal best time of 2:01.8 in the 800m, while Erik McMichael also recorded a PR in the 1500m at 4:08.7. Spears continued the streak with his best 400m hurdle effort of the season at 55.1, nearly tops in the conference. Rob King had a hammer throw of 108’, while Lee Sutton (41' 11") and freshman Bo Bartholomew (39' 9") geared up for the conference meet.

**Number one senior has led team selflessly last four seasons**

By Brannon Buck

If you know Albie Varoski off the tennis court, then you probably have an image in your mind of a light-hearted, Guns ‘n Roses listening, fun-loving, kind of guy. But if you take time to watch him in a Davidson College tennis match, where...he has represented the school for three years as the number one singles player, then your image of Albie suddenly changes a bit. When Albie steps on a tennis court he discards the light-heartedness and takes on the look of a tough-minded, never-say-die competitor. To his teammates and coach, this combination results in a captain who leads by example and gives everything for the sake of the team. This role as selfless leader is one that Davidson. When asked about his number one player, Coach Jeff Frank points out the improvement that has characterized Albie’s game, both physically and mentally, since his arrival as a freshman. Great ground strokes and quick foot-speed, which allow him to wear down opponents, have always been the trademark of Albie’s game. But with a work ethic that Coach Frank refers to as one of the best he has ever seen, Albie has improved his volleys and his mental toughness to the point Albie has grown into over his four years at Davidson.

Albie Varoski Nears End of Outstanding Career

where he is comfortable playing number one and is competing with the best players in the nation. What is remarkable about Albie’s career is not his win-loss record, but rather his consistency day in and day out and his ability to avoid the upset. He simply does not lose to lesser players. And all the while, he has come up with important wins when the team has needed them. Albie entered the singles line-up at the number two position his freshman year where he enjoyed a strong season defeating such powerhouses as North Carolina, Clemson, and Wake Forest. Since then he has played at number one singles and at various positions in doubles. His career dual-match record in singles stands at 64-55 while his career doubles record is 63-27. When asked to ponder his own game, Albie says that intense motivation and hard work have been essential to his success. Anyone who has seen Albie lose a tight match knows how much he despises losing, and this intense aversion has served as his motivation to practice more and play better. “If there is one thing that drives me,” says Albie, “it is that I hate to lose... even more than I love to win.” But motivation can come in many ways, and for Albie it started during the recruiting process. One of the things he takes most pride in is beating players from schools where the coaches refused to recruit him. Albie tells of writing to the coaches at Furman, Wake Forest, and William and Mary in high school. But none of them wrote him back or returned his phone calls. “Those are the schools I love to beat,” says Albie. For the record, he has wins over all of them, and is 5-2 against Furman. Albie gives credit to Coach Frank for recognizing his ability when everyone else was passing him up. “I wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for Coach Frank.” This season has been a little different.

Men's Tennis Earns Victories in Tennessee

By Brannon Buck

In two hard-fought Southern Conference matches, Coach Frank and his team earned victories over Tenn-Chatt and East Tennessee State. These two wins improved the Wildcats’ record to 14-4, with four matches remaining on the schedule. Davidson defeated UTC on Friday by a score of 6-1. The Wildcats started the match by winning all three doubles to earn, what can be, a crucial point if the singles are even. In the singles, Dan Grinnan and Dave Tonidandel turned in their customary solid performances which have almost become the backbone of the team. Their consistency and ability to win day in and day out allow the other players on the team to relax and play better. That is exactly what happened on Friday, as Albie Varoski, Holt Vaughan, and David Jespersen followed the lead of the Grinnan-Tonidandel tandem to win five of the six singles matches. Vaughan played a particularly outstanding match at number two, coming from down 4-5 in the first set to post a 7-5, 6-3 victory.

On Saturday the Wildcats made the three-and-a-half-hour trek to ETSU in hopes of defeating the reigning conference champion. The task was not an easy one as the Buccaneers boast the 13th ranked player in the nation as well as the worst facilities of any school in the conference. Davidson did eke out a tight 4-3 win. In the doubles, Jespersen and Vaughan won at number two and Varoski and Chris Parker won at number three to pick up what turned out to be a very crucial point. Then Varoski matched up against 13th ranked Yaser Zaatini, who recently defeated the number one ranked player, and provided a competitive match, losing 6-3, 6-1. At number three, Russell Briggs broke out of a minor slump and played exceptionally well to defeat Luis Gonzalez 6-1, 6-2. And true to their usual form, Grinnan and Tonidandel posted strong victories at the number five and six positions.
