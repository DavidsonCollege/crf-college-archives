"The Most Important General Work on the Life of Christ in Our Language"

THE LIFE AND TIMES OF JESUS THE MESSIAH

Anything can happen when the jovial spirit of the famous cartoonist, Al Capp (Daddy of Li'l Abner and his Dogpatch
friends), invades and captivates a college campus. Mr. and Mrs. Capp, the king and queen of the festival, have artistically
gathered around them thousands of Carolina students. Li’l Abner would feel at home here where the college students liven their
“carefree collitch days” by paying tribute to that homely young lady who couldn’t get her man in the normal manner.
Sadie Hawkins did all this to Chapel Hill... . Above you see the hangover.

The International Sunday School Lessons for the first half of 1942 are on the Life of Christ. No better help
can be suggested to teachers and students than The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah by the great Hebrew
Christian, Dr. Edersheim.

This Life of Christ is interwoven with a history of the times in which He lived. It brings out not
only the facts, but all the background so necessary in the interpretation of the facts.
