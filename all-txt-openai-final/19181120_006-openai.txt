kill, of the non-S.A.T.C., President Wilson. The plan was acclaimed as a good one as each company cheered its colors
lustily. The meeting was then adjourned for the canvass. “To your tents, O Israel.” The companies withdrew to their respectivequarters
and the portentous battle developed. Company A began with a vigorous frontal attack and made some apparent gains. But, shortly,
Company B, after brilliant maneuvering, threw her veteran lines against the flanks of the surprised foe. The splendid work of
Captain Shield's forces, who reported a thousand dollars in pledges, appeared on the scene in the form of Blucher. The
day appeared theirs. Already General "Diaz," emulating his noted grandsire of the days of old Rome, had cried, "I came,
I saw, I conquered." But the victory was not to be so quickly rendered. The British in Company C's forces
were as usual slow in gaining momentum, but then they came on with the impetuosity and tenacity of Tennyson's famous
Six Hundred: "Cannons to the right of them, Cannons to the left of them, Cannons behind them," onward Company C
charged. Liberty Bonds and month's wages were thrown into the contest. The eye of the British chieftain grew bold and
flashed with pride. Their victory was complete, and on Company C rested the honors of the day. The results were
authenticated and announced in chapel at noon on Thursday. It was found that Company C, with 72 subscribers, had pledged
$2,063, or $28.75 per capita. The others had pledged as follows: Company B, with 76 subscribers, $1,664.77; Company A, with
72 subscribers, $1,516.00; Company D, with 57 subscribers, $1,148.23; and the non-S.A.T.C. students, with 47 subscriptions, $787.50. These totaled $7,179.50,
or $22.20 per capita, giving Davidson the lead per capita among North Carolina colleges. There was one subscription of $100.
Several contributed amounts exceeding $50. But the rank and file were from $20 to $30. The campaign was an exceedingly
enthusiastic one, and were Sir Edward Creasy still living he might recount Wednesday night's events as the world’s sixteenth decisive
battle.

BLUFF!

Why do the giddiest signboards Hang on the stupidest places? Why does abysmal heart-sadness Lurk behind smilingest faces? Why does
the gaudiest cover Compass the prosiest book? Why does the frothiest frosting Cover the crime of the cook? Why does
the great game of bluffing Camouflage life far and wide? God knows whether anything ever Will be what it looks
like outside.
—Jean Milne Grower.
