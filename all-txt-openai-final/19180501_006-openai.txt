JUNIOR-SENIOR DEBATE IS WON BY THE PHI SOCIETY

The Philanthropic Society was victorious in the Annual Junior-Senior debate which was held in the Eumenean Society hall last Monday
night. The subject for debate was “Resolved, That Congress should enact legislation for the compulsory arbitration of disputes between organized
labor and corporations, constitutionally waived.” The Phi Society was represented by R. B. McClure, W. C. Neel, and W. M.
Currie, while the Eu Society was represented by L. M. Thomas, A. S. Potts, and D. M. Orgain. A medal
was awarded to the best debater in each society, the medal in the Phi Society being awarded to W. M.
Currie, and in the Eu to L. M. Thomas.

The debate was snappy throughout and showed that the debaters had put much time and thought on the subject and
were well prepared. Each speaker brought out his points in a clear and convincing manner, although some of them indulged
in a little camouflage for the benefit of the judges. The affirmative brought out as its main points: (1) that
voluntary arbitration has failed; (2) that the proposed amendment is necessary because of the materialistic and economic conditions; (3) that
the proposed method will be a satisfactory remedy; (4) it will be practical and could be enforced; it is logical;
it is the method demanded by justice; it is the duty of the government to settle labor disputes. The negative
admitted that conditions are not altogether satisfactory. Then they showed that the proposed method was unwise in principle and unjust
to the employee and the public. They also showed that it was undemocratic and would bring an involuntary servitude. Furthermore,
they showed that the proposed method would infringe on the employers’ right of free contract. Besides this, they proved that
it would not stop strikes and cited as examples countries in which it has been tried. They also stressed the
fact that the affirmative had based its arguments on hasty generalizations and had not considered two important phases of the
question. The first of these was the difference between arbitration and compulsory arbitration; the second phase was that the question,
as stated, affected only one-fifth of the laborers and hence could not be considered a satisfactory remedy.

The judges of the debate were Messrs. E. W. Pharr, J. W. Keerans, and Hamilton C. Jones, of the Charlotte
bar.

TENNIS TOURNAMENT IS STILL BEING PLAYED

On account of the inclemency of the weather, the tennis tournament has been rather long drawn out. Within another week
it should be completed. When the rain allows a few matches to be played, a great many spectators gather around
the courts to see the play—for most of the matches have been closely contested. Manager W. F. Hall is trying
to arrange a tournament with some other college, but has not been able to do so as yet. It is
hoped that in the near future Davidson will be represented in this form of athletics, and we feel confident that
she will excel in this sport, as she does in others.

SINGLES

In the first round of the singles, McPheeters, Cunningham, and Kennedy have yet to play. Gaither and Roddey have finished
their match, the former winning by a score of 6-2, 8-6. Throughout the match Roddey played an uphill game, coming
back strong in the second set. Gaither worked in a variety of good strokes. E. G. Lilly defeated Mahood by
a score of 6-0, 6-2. The most exciting match in the first round was played by W. F. Hall and
T. H. Spence. Hall won by a 5-7, 6-2, 6-3 score. Spence played a fast net game but finally had
to give in to his opponent. Only one match has been played in the second round, Lilly winning in a
match. The score was 6-2, 7-9, 6-3. In the third round, W. F. Hall played a very close game with
I. A. Woods, the former winning by a score of 7-5, 8-6, 3-6, 6-4.

DOUBLES

There were onlyFive entries in the doubles tournament this season, Crood and W. M. Jones lost to W. F. Hall
and Spence by a 6-1, 6-2, 6-2 score. The former were not up to their usual form. McPheeters and McKelden
lost to Kennedy and Gaither to the tune of 6-3, 6-4, 6-2. W. F. Hall and Spence defeated Cunningham and
B. A. Woods by the score of 6-2, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4. The second round of the doubles will take place
soon. They should prove to be very interesting to all lovers of good tennis.

DAVIDSON WINS FROM CAROLINA IN ELEVENTH

pearance in Varsity uniforms, as a result of the general shake-up Coach Fetzer has given his line-up. Ratchford and Richards
divided with King the honors for driving in the runs, and Sutton played a clean, faultless game at first, accepting
16 chances without a bobble. Burns also caught a good game and with the exception of one passed ball, fielded
in good form. He threw out the only two men who attempted to pilfer an extra base, discouraging all attempts
on second base successfully. The line-up follows:
