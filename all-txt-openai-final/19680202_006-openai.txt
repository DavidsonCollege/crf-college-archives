**Santana Kilpatrick, Mullen, Penick — Campus Comment**

**Students Knock Exam System**

These students offered their suggestions in response to the question “Is there a better way to conduct final exams?”

John Huggins, sophomore: “I would favor change in the content as well as the conduct of exams. Exams have been
pointing toward a creative use of the material rather than simply repeating material. It is important that the student show
what he can do with the material, not what he can reproduce.”

Cary White, senior: “The best way to conduct exams would be to have them all be open book with as
much time as desired to take them. This would eliminate last-minute cramming and would help the student unify the material
learned in the course.”

Steve Brown, senior: “I like the exam system that they have at Haverford. You can cram exams in at the
first if you desire to go home or you can space them throughout the exam period. Under the present system
at Davidson, everyone is potentially capable of being hurt by an undesirable exam schedule.”

Robin Gottfried, sophomore: “If we are going to be on an honor system, we should be allowed to take exams
under that system. We should be able to take the exam when we are ready. This would allow the student
to better arrange his schedule for studying.”

**Plan Trip To Haverford**
By JOHN WILLIAMS
Staff Writer

Joe Kilpatrick said Tuesday that he, Pat Mullen, and George Penick will leave next Thursday on a student exchange trip
to Haverford College, Haverford, Pa. Kilpatrick, chairman of the Student Exchange Committee, told the Student Council that the visit would
last three days and that they would survey every conceivable aspect of the school. The purpose of the visit is
to discover both strong and weak points about Davidson College through comparison with Haverford and to discover new ideas about
college life which can possibly be applied at Davidson. Kilpatrick again encouraged faculty members to contact him if they have
any areas which they particularly want explored.

An attempt to hold a council meeting on Monday during chapel period proved abortive when too few members attended to
constitute a quorum. At the council meeting, a committee consisting of Geoff Seamans, Joe Murphy, Franklin Anderson, and a freshman
to be named later was also picked to select four students from a list of about 20 to attend the
IMPACT symposium at Vanderbilt University in April. President Tom Earnhardt told the Council that the University of North Carolina has
invited Davidson to send two representatives to a National Student Association regional conference in Atlanta in March. The Council decided
to choose the delegates at its next meeting.

**Series Presents Fourth Program**

A program of music, ranging from Wagner's “Gotterdammerung” to Rochberg's “Time Span II,” will be presented by the Charlotte Symphony
Orchestra at Love Auditorium on Feb. 8.

**College Receives $125,000 Grant**

Davidson has received grants totaling $125,000 from the Duke Endowment to raise salaries during 1968-69, President D. Grier Martin announced
recently. Of that amount, $100,000 will be used to sustain and improve Davidson's faculty and staff salary scale, and $25,000
will be used for faculty recognition and encouragement. The $25,000 grant will be used to encourage faculty members to redesign
and upgrade their courses during the summer in preparation for Davidson's new Blue Sky curriculum.

**Black Churchman Asks American Cultural Change**

Dr. Ernest Smith, director of race relations for the Methodist Church, said that America must face reality and accept black
people on an equal basis. In his talk at chapel Tuesday, “The Black Rebellion: America’s Confrontation with Democratic Idealism,” Smith
said that a cultural, not legal, change was needed in America. During these post-war years, Smith pointed out that the
civil rights movement made significant advances in the United States. In 1966, however, the movement became bogged down in conservative
legislation. The stall brought frustration and despair to many Negroes. Many questions were raised—“Is America serious?” and “Does the Christian
church really practice brotherhood?” Smith said that Vietnam should not be used as an excuse for the failure of home
policies. He stated that blacks would force America to recognize her sickness and would continue to make her prove herself.

**Faculty (Continued From Page One)**

- Grade points on a 4.5 scale.
- Rank in class on a 1.5 scale.

Under this system, an “F” will receive no points, instead of the current minus two. In addition, plusses may be
used on grades at the halfway point in each range. Quality point requirements in major subjects, and for graduation, were
not discussed and will be recommended at a later date by the Educational Policy Committee. Under the proposals accepted Tuesday,
the ROTC program will continue under certain revisions, with freshmen and sophomores required to participate.ed to take and pass the
basic course in addition to the eight-course requirement established by the Blue Sky curriculum. The faculty, in another curriculum revision,
also established, for a two-year trial period, an opportunity for junior and senior students to elect a maximum of four
courses during the two years to be graded on a “pass or fail” basis. These courses are to be outside
the major. The cut system was discussed at length, and a move was made toward the establishment of a 25
percent cut limitation in all academic programs, including physical education and chapel.

Two proposals of the Religious Policy Committee were accepted. The first calls for the college to begin each school year
with a formal religious convocation. The second establishes the policy of having an average of one major assembly speaker per
week, with one out of three being a religious program, and that the other assembly program each week be used
for student government and student interest matters.

The faculty also accepted the recommendation of the Educational Policy Committee for approval of the interdisciplinary science course as provided
under a Sloan Foundation grant. The course, to be implemented next year, will emphasize the relationships between the three major
branches of natural science.

Average faculty salaries exclusive of fringe benefits have been raised from $5,815 in 1957-58 to $12,192 in 1967-68, according to
Robert J. Sailstad, director of public relations and development. Additional fringe benefits such as annuity payments, tuition grants to faculty
children, and hospitalization now add another $2,006 on average to each faculty member's compensation at Davidson. According to a recent
study, Davidson is ranked among the top 20 colleges of its type in the nation in providing faculty fringe benefits,
Sailstad said.

WINNER—Frank Fleming, a Davidson senior from Concord, has been named a recipient of a $19,000 scholarship for graduate study at
the Bowman Gray School of Medicine at Wake Forest University. Fleming was one of eight N.C. residents to be named
winners of the scholarship.

This will be the fourth program in the Davidson Artist Series. Guest artist will be Miss Edith Peinemann, the German
violinist who made her American debut in 1962. Jacques Brourman will direct the orchestra. In addition to music from “Gotterdammerung”
and “Time Span II,” the program will include Bach's “Suite No. 3 in D Major” and Dvorak's “Concerto in A
Minor for Violin and Orchestra,” with Miss Peinemann as soloist. Miss Peinemann has played with orchestras all over the world,
including symphonies in Amsterdam, London, Prague, Stockholm, Vienna, and Zurich, as well as Houston, Chicago, and Dallas. The New York
Times has called her “a first-class violinist who should become one of the major performers of our time,” and the
Washington Evening Star found her “a virtuoso recitalist of impressive temperament and mature style.” Free student tickets for the 8:15
p.m. performance will be available at the College Union Desk.

BRICE RECEIVES CONGRATULATIONS
Martin expresses college’s thanks to retiring equipment operator.

John Brice Retires; Served From 1933
John Brice, who is retiring after 35 years of service at Davidson, was honored at a reception Tuesday. For most
of his career, Brice operated the equipment in the mimeograph room of Chambers Building. His nephew, Lewis Connor, will replace
him in supervising operations there. “John has performed outstanding service for good relations in his home community in Cornelius as
well as in the Davidson community,” said President D. Grier Martin. “All of us at Davidson will miss John for
many reasons, all good.” On behalf of the college, Martin presented Brice with a wristwatch and a Davidson College chair.
His wife was given a cameo and earring set and a corsage. After Martin's short speech, Mrs. Brice said she
was very happy that her husband “was loved by this college as much as he loved you.” Brice simply said,
“I just don't know how to thank you all.”

Geologist Slated To Visit Tuesday
Dr. James Dorman, geophysicist, will speak Tuesday at 7 p.m. in Dana 114. The lecture topic will be the “earth's
upper mantle — the geologically active layer.” Sigma Pi Sigma, physics honor society, will sponsor Dorman’s lecture as part of
its Visiting Scientist Program. Dorman is assistant director of Lamont Geological Observatory of Columbia University, where his chief interests are
the propagation of long-period seismic waves and the structure of the crust and upper mantle of the earth. He is
a graduate of Carleton College, Northwestern University, and Columbia University, where he received a PhD in geophysics in 1961. Since
then he has served as research scientist and senior research scientist at the Lamont Observatory and as a visiting lecturer
in geology at the University of Wisconsin in 1963. Dorman became assistant director of the observatory in 1965.

OPEN HOUSE isn't sexy. It isn't even against faculty rules. But it's a good way to spend a Sunday evening.

No Telephone Chairmen Resign, Despite Critics
Each of the 30 telephone chairmen for the first semester has retained the position for this semester, according to Mrs.
Peter Nicholls, Director of Student Housing. Mrs. Nicholls noted that no one chose to resign from his job after the
administration decided to do away with the positions at the end of the school year. The decision was originally made
in response to charges that telephone chairmen were not performing their prescribed duties. The administration's decree offered the chairmen the
possibility of resignation if they wished to be relieved of their obligations. In addition, the statement addressed to the chairmen
noted that failure to perform their duties during the second semester would result in more serious action.
