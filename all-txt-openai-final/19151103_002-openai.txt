The Davidsonian | VOLUNTEER BAND NEWS. Published every Wednesday of the College Year by the Students of Davidson College.

At the beginning of the year the Volunteer Band had a membership of twenty-five. As a result of the Y. M. C. A. conference at Guilford and the Chapman-Alexander meetings here, the number has risen to thirty-three. In the meetings held every Sunday, a study is being made of the lives of various missionaries.

At the beginning of the year the Band pledged to raise the traveling expenses of C. M. Gibbs (’15), who will leave next year for Soon-Chun, Korea. An effort is being made to secure the necessary amount by the middle of January. The members of the Band intend to do the same deputation work as was done last year. They will go in pairs to the various churches of Mecklenburg County and make missionary addresses. The first Sunday in December has been set apart for this. The object of these addresses is simply to arouse interest in foreign missions.

FURMAN PLAYS HERE ON SATURDAY

On Saturday, Davidson is scheduled to play Furman on the Sprunt Athletic field. The Red and Black will be in excellent condition, as they have not played a heavy game in two weeks. Furman has a good team for a college of its size, and will give Davidson some work to win from them. This is the first time the two colleges will meet. Last year the two teams were scheduled to play, but Furman was forced to cancel. A full statement is given elsewhere in this issue regarding the cancellation of the game with South Carolina. We ask the reader to carefully weigh these facts and then render a decision as to where the blame for the cancellation should be placed. Simply remember that for seventeen years Davidson has played South Carolina in football, and twice has South Carolina been victorious. There is every reason to believe that the game this year would have only added another victory to the now already long chain. Much more in the way of comment could be given, but mere words are many times only substitutes for facts. We prefer to give the facts and allow the reader to come to an impartial decision.

CHAPMAN-ALEXANDER MEETINGS AT ASHEVILLE

From all reports, the Chapman-Alexander meetings at Asheville have been just as successful there as they were here October 12, 13, and 14 of the last month. When the meetings began it was thought that the seating capacity of five thousand would be sufficient to accommodate the crowds, but at every meeting the seats are filled, every available piece of standing room taken, and still the people are being turned away by hundreds. Dr. Chapman has been preaching powerful and searching sermons, and the people have responded wonderfully. Mr. Alexander has charge of the singing. Two of the favorite songs are “The Ivory Palaces,” written and composed by Mr. Barraclough, and “HeWants a Poor Sinner Like Me.” It is with pleasure that the Davidson men learn that Mr. Alexander, who was slightly ill for several days after leaving here, is again able to take charge of the singing.

Clemson—An effort is now being made to re-establish the honor system at Clemson which was voluntarily abandoned by the students several years ago. A strong editorial appeared last week in “The Tiger,” the college weekly, urging its adoption.

Winthrop College—In a recent issue of the “Winthrop Weekly” there appeared a picture of a practice home, which the Senior class in domestic science occupies for a definite interval during the college year. The details of housekeeping are thus presented in a most forcible and striking manner.

Rev. Albert S. Maxwell (’09) will enter upon mission work in Brazil this fall. Mr. Maxwell was moderator of the recent meeting of Wilmington Presbytery, of which Rev. W. M. Baker, of Wilmington, N. C., of the same class, was the retiring moderator.

Because the coach of the University of West Virginia football team ran upon the field and refused to leave in two minutes when ordered to do so by the referee, the recent game between the University and Washington and Lee was forfeited to Washington and Lee by the score of 1 to 0.

University of North Carolina—On November 10 Mr. Alfred Noyes, the English poet, will make his second appearance at the University of North Carolina. The query that will be discussed this year by the High Schools having membership in the High School Debating Union of North Carolina is: “Resolved: That the United States should adopt the policy of greatly enlarging its Navy.”
