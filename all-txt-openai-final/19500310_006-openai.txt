KA 42; Pika 38
Led by “Fearless Freddy” Preyer’s 14 points, the KA’s edged the Pikas by a narrow 42-38 margin. Smith of the
Pikas shared the limelight with Preyer by also hitting for 14 points.

Phi Delt 37; SAE 35
Paced by Auburn Lambeth with 14 points, the Phi Delts barely beat out the SAE’s 37-35 for the dubious privilege
of playing the Kappa Sigs in the third round. Half score was 19-14 in favor of the Phi Delts. Aiken
led the SAE’s with 11 points.

Sigma Chi 44; Campus Club 21

In the first round of the inter-frat tourney, the KA’s coasted to an easy 26-16 victory over the Independents. At
the half, the KA machine had a comfortable 13-6 lead. Preyer and McKeithan led the KA’s with 6 points apiece,
and Rittenberg also dropped through 6 to pace the Independents.

Pi Kapp 45; Beta 29
The Beta hard-wooders proved to be completely impotent in the face of a blistering Pi Kapp offense which took an
easy 45-29 victory. Cassels led the Pi Kapps with 16 points. The Betas were paced by Groves with 10.

Phi Delt 33; Phi Gam 29
In a tight, close game, which saw the score tied 15 all at halftime, the Phi Delts finally pulled ahead
to edge the Phi Gams 33-29. High man for the Phi Delts was Auburn Lambeth with 11 points.

Campus Club 27; SPE 16
The Campus Clubbers advanced to the second round by trouncing the SPE's 27-16. Rinson hit the hoops for 7 points
to lead the Campus Club scorers, while Wilson and Rabb split SPE honors with 4 apiece.

fact been replaced by a nationalistic tyranny, using the original idea only as a means of reaching its final goal,
the domination of the world. The classless society could not be established and there seems to be no evidence that
it ever will be. The theory of international understanding on a communist basis is proved to be wrong by the
Russian dominated countries, which do not hesitate even to take the help of the number one enemy, the capitalistic society.
While, however, in America, these developments can take place in the open and with less friction, because of the freedom
of the individual, and thus to a certain extent also because of the free society in existence, it is very
difficult to detect any clear changes in the Russian setup, and we must rely more or less on speculations that
can only be supported poorly. In general, however, it may be said, that there are to be found definite changes
in both society setups involved, which in turn give us more proof that the hypotheses of another collision is not
entirely unsupportable. Up to now, following human history, we find that most collisions between extremes took place in forms of
war. This might lead to the idea that war is the only sufficient way to be found, and it is
also widely said that war, as long as different ideas exist, will be inevitable. To contradict this concept of war
would in the eyes of many people mean to show an almost dangerous optimism or to be unable to face
the facts existing. It is clear, that war up to now was used to perform a certain function. It was
taken as a means to settle vital differences between nations or to solve problems concerning the relation and the standing
of nations to each other. Many people say that its primary origin is to be found within human character, which
strives for competition and tries to impose certain ideas on others. The same characteristics could be found within a nation.
As long as human nature would not change, therefore no changes in the existence and importance of war could be
reached. First, it may be answered, that war never has been able to settle any vital differences, as long as
they were not questions of mere power. On the contrary, it has only been the cause of another war. In
my opinion, we are facing the tremendous task to find a substitute for war, a substitute which might be even
more efficient than war. It must be something that performs the settling function of war, without using or adding its
destructive function. War in the sense of competition and the effort to impose certain ideas on others will always exist,
but it is not necessary to be performed in the way they were performed up to now, and which differs
from the animal-like destruction only in one aspect, their greater efficiency. Where this, probably very real, substitute may be found
is a question I am unable to answer. Man has been searching for it; in religion, in parliament and in
the roundtable conference. He has tried to avoid war during recent times, but this...

conciliation of differences. And I have tried to speak out always for this United Nations way of preventing war and
building peace. “I have seen a good many crises in the past four years,” he observes, “and I should not
have expected otherwise. For what was the United Nations made, if not to deal with troubles and crises? “In 1946,
there was Iran, the Soviet delegate left the Security Council meeting. “Then in 1947, the problem of Palestine was handed
to the United Nations. We have had several crises over that problem since then. “In 1947, there was also the
Balkans question, which was particularly serious that year. “In 1948, there was Czechoslovakia and Indonesia and many other serious crises.
“In the latter part of 1948 and the first part of 1949, there was the very dangerous crisis caused by
the Great Power Conflict over Berlin. “The United Nations,” Trygve Lie points out, “has managed to survive all these and
other crises. Furthermore, in most cases, it has made some progress toward settling the problems that caused the trouble. “The
United Nations,” declares the Secretary-General, “is too important to each and every member government for any of them to permit
lasting or irreparable damage to be done to the organization by the present political conflict.”

Mooresville, N. C.more because of fear of the terrifying weapons that will be used and that are beyond his control,
than because of his understanding of war to be unethical and below human nature. It might be that our religion
provides an answer as to where to find this substitute. Maybe a new philosophy will give it to us. It
is beyond my capacity even to eliminate the sources, which the answer may be found. But it is my strong
belief in a divine law in human history and in a great meaning and reason within the existence of the
human race, that makes me hope that this substitute may be found before it is too late. It must be
found, because future wars would mean destruction, and destruction can possibly be the end of human history. Give a pessimist
a piece of rope and he'll hang himself, but give an optimist the same piece of rope and he'll start

into that work themselves. This program was the last in a series on foreign missions. The next five are to
be on subjects relating to Easter. Beginning Sunday, March 12, the series will open with Prof. Henry Boumann presenting the
“How and Why We Have The Will of God.” Speakers are yet to be chosen for the following four Sundays.
The planned topics, which are subject to change, are “Christian Discipline,” “The Meaning of the Lord’s Supper,” “The Christian Doctrine

spent short and unscholastic sessions at the University of Southern California, and at tennis-happy Rollins College.

Improvement Noted Palo Alto, Calif. — (I.P.) — You can’t force a man to like music. That’s what William Loran
Crosten, head of Stanford University’s Music Department, believes. Professor Crosten, speaking of developments in general education as applied to music
courses, suggested two guides for a general college music course: first, that students enrolled in the course have some taste
for music; and second, that the purpose of the course be to help students increase their enjoyment of the art.
He pointed out that the study of music is now accepted as a desirable part of the undergraduate course, and
has ceased to be considered merely a luxury. “This state of affairs, as might be expected, has caused a certain
amount of jubilation among the musical fraternity. It is, after all, no small thing to be permitted in the parlor
after waiting so long on the doorstep.”

DAVIDSON WORLD’S TOP (Continued From Page Four) Gonzales and Kramer are deadly in their eagerness to win. Gonzales has a
considerable plus factor going for him. He is only 21 as compared with Kramer’s 28. The seven years are in
Gonzales’ favor and can be the difference on the long road of professional competition. Pancho’s severe style of play has
added a new spirit to the play-for-loot game. The public goes for this dashing, swarthy lad with the flashing teeth
and the what-the-devil manner. Just as he took up the slack when Kramer departed from amateur tennis, so has Gonzales
filled a gap in the professional field. The Parker-Segura meeting provides an eye-fill too. Parker is the strategist of the
court, the man with the finest backhand in tennis, the man who was ranked among the first ten for 16
straight years. Against him is fiery Francisco, who wields a two-handed forehand and whose bandy legs carry him around the
court at high speed.
