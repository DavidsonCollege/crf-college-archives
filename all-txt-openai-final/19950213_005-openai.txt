Gullan says, “I think we need to consider character ... the ability to live under the Honor Code. There are so many things to being a Davidson student. Our thrust should be for well-rounded people.”

When Gullan expressed this concern about admissions during the campaign, many perceived it as his desire to “dumb-down” the student body. Gullan says, “That is not at all what I was saying. We need to promise them [applicants] a challenging academic environment.”

Many freshmen felt particularly slighted since it seemed that Gullan was speaking especially about them. Gullan says, “I don’t see a problem, but I see warning signs,” such as decreased involvement in extracurriculars.

Gullan proposes to increase student involvement in the admissions and application process. Also, he wants students to have a say in the goals of the Admissions Office or at least regular communication with the office.

Another major goal for Gullan’s administration is to try to foster increased unity on campus between whites and minorities. “It is important to get everyone at the table and get everybody talking and understanding where everybody is coming from,” he says.

Gullan’s approach to find unity is to focus on what students share in common rather than what separates them. “Diversity and unity are on the same continuum. The more we concentrate on differences, the harder it is to find commonality,” he says.

Rather than focusing on group experience, Gullan wants to emphasize individuality: “If we approach issues from what the blacks feel, what the women feel, we are missing out on individual contributions.” Gullan hopes to be a “facilitator” and not a “combatant” in discussions of race and division on campus. “All I can do is through honest, heart-to-heart, mind-to-mind communication create a climate of openness. Part of what I hope to gain is some sort of empathy and sympathy and understanding of commonality.”

Gullan’s goal to increase communication has the approval of Assistant to Director of Career Services Tony Perez. “There are two ways of approaching [race problems]. One is the way Bill is going about it: trying to break down walls and barriers and creating harmony. What Bill is doing is fine, it’s great.”

Associate Professor of History J. Russell Snapp was recently invited to join the Historical Society of North Carolina. Snapp will be inducted into the society at its upcoming April 7 meeting.

The society, organized in 1945, limits its membership to 75 active historians. Members are traditionally specialists in American history with an interest in North Carolina history. The society meets twice a year, with agendas that include presentations and discussions of research reports written by members or other prominent historians. The spring meeting will be held at the Greensboro Historical Museum. Normally, the meetings are held at different campuses throughout the state.

Snapp is scheduled to be a speaker at his induction. The topic for the meeting is “Dynamics of Politics in the Colonial South.” Snapp will discuss how the ethnic backgrounds of certain British officials influenced the ideas of empire in the colonies. The topic of his presentation at the meeting is related to his forthcoming book, John Stuart and the Issue of Empire on the Southern Frontier, to be published in the next few months by L.S.U.Press. Snapp’s book deals with how the British policy towards the Native Americans in the 18th century angered colonists in Georgia and the Carolinas, creating tension that led to the Revolutionary War. This book is his first, but Snapp has also written many biographical sketches of North Carolina colonial leaders for the forthcoming book, American National Biography, to be published by Oxford University Press. His subjects include Christopher Gaffenreid, the founder of New Bern, and governors Arthur Dobbs and William Tryon. In 1991, he also published an article on William Henry Drayton, a Revolutionary leader in South Carolina, entitled “The Journal of Southern History.” Snapp graduated summa cum laude from the University of the South and earned his Master’s degree and Ph.D. from Harvard University. He was a teaching fellow at Harvard before joining the Davidson faculty in 1988. Davidson faculty who formerly held memberships in the society include C.K. Brown, Frontis Johnson, Chalmers Davidson, and David Shi. Snapp looks forward to joining the society. He says, “It’s an excellent way to get to know my colleagues from other institutions in the state and share ideas with them. Sharing ideas can be very stimulating and make one’s research more vital. Also, being from Arkansas originally, it makes me feel more like a North Carolinian.”

Students ride for Habitat

This summer, bikers from across the nation will ride a 4,000-mile course across the United States to raise money for Habitat for Humanity. The tour stretches from Washington, D.C. to San Francisco. Each biker will ride a portion of the “Bikecentennial National Trail.” The Davidson branch of Habitat will participate as part of the 25 core group riders which will ride the 4,000 miles from coast to coast. To help Habitat raise money for the event, seniors Sarah Cantrell and Jodi Lewis will head a group of volunteers doing construction work in Charlotte in the spring. Cantrell helped with Habitat over the Christmas holidays and feels that “the bicycle challenge really reflects the spirit of service that Davidson embodies ... I feel lucky to be able to have the opportunity to strike out on this adventure on behalf of Habitat for Humanity.”

Habitat for Humanity is a non-profit, international organization dedicated to building homes for low-income families. In conjunction with homeowners, Habitat constructs the homes offering a no-interest mortgage to the recipients. The money raised by the group will underwrite the construction costs of one home. Cantrell and Lewis invite and welcome all tax-deductible donations made payable to Habitat Bicycle Challenge. Donors should send checks to P.O. Box 3086, or they can contact Cantrell or Lewis personally.
