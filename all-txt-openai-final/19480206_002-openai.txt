THE DAVIDSONIAN
Founded by the Class of 1915
“FOR A BETTER DAVIDSON”

PUBLISHED WEEKLY THROUGHOUT THE COLLEGE YEAR

What with the universal exam hangover, the departure of rumor-mongers Ennett and Oglesby, and the chill winds which have blown
no one good, your dealer-in-dirt is somewhat at a loss for material this week. However, we feel obliged to run
this column with every issue; for we've finally realized that in the opinion of most of the student body, without
the “Operating Table” the DAVIDSONIAN would be no sheet at all.

Recently the Davidson team traveled to the campus of a large Southern Conference school to meet the latter's basketball five.
A handful, perhaps fifty, of the Davidson student body were able to fight icy highways to follow their team to
lend vocal support. The treatment that these Davidson rooters saw their courageous Red and Black receive at the hands of
the host student body enraged a few and disgusted all of them. The strictly partisan crowd booed vociferously any and
all decisions called against them, however obviously justifiable, and just as loudly they roared their approval of those called against
the Davidson team. At one point late in the game, with the score too close for the comfort of the
host student body, a Davidson player was awarded a foul shot. As he stepped up to the foul line, our
hosts set up such a hue and cry that an official stopped the proceedings then and there until the crowd
could show a semblance of decency. Their refusal to do this moved the official to call a double technical foul
on the host team! This action finally succeeded in calming the rowdy gathering, which could apparently be gentlemanly only for
the sake of expedience.

Now the purpose of this article is not to indignantly call for snowballs and the like. Perhaps the subject school’s
supporters did not enhance our chances of victory, but whatever aid it might have lent the victors was surely outbalanced
by the discredit which the action reflected on their school, a school incidentally whose athletic teams have generally been admired
by Davidson athletes for sportsmanship deserving a deserving opponent. In our humble opinion, that an- nouncement that there will be
a special meeting of representatives of all schools belonging to the Southern Conference later this month, since a discussion of
the N.C.A.A.’s “Purity Code” was neatly sidestepped at the last regular meeting, it seems quite reasonable to expect that this
code will be the chief item on the agenda when the loop’s sports moguls put their heads together.

As various writers, coaches and fans have pointed out, the Southern Conference obviously is not at present a balanced one.
When one checks the makeup and membership of the Southeastern or the Southwest Conference, to use two familiar examples, it
is immediately apparent that the competing schools come much closer to being the same size than do those in our
own league. A brief glance at football or basketball schedules and scores for the past few seasons will also show
that the teams in those and other circuits are more evenly matched and that they compete against more loop brethren
than do Southern Conference teams. We will in most cases admit that there is need for “reform,” but we must
also realize that we alone cannot hope to force any other school to conform to rules against its will. If,
however, we send our representatives to the meeting with a concrete policy we may be able to persuade the others
that it is time to adopt a policy of fair play. Those spectators who displayed such unsportsman-like conduct committed a
grave injustice to the team that was representing them, for those of us from Davidson who attended the game were
unfortunately more lastingly impressed by the untoward actions of the rest of the spectators than we were by the expected
clean play of that school’s basketballers. We realize that many of our hosts were duly embarrassed by their schoolmates’ conduct,
but from outward appearances there wasn’t a gentleman among them. That is a terrible indictment, but it is made nevertheless,
primarily to show you how delicate is the reputation of a college student body, and to emphasize the responsibility of
each of you in maintaining the name of Davidson College as a school of gentlemen. Don’t you or you ever
give cause for our conduct to be called less than gentlemanly toward a visiting athletic team!

As various writers, coaches and fans have pointed out, the SouthernAverage Davidson student thinks seriously about the college and tries
to decide what makes it tick, the names of Dr. Cunningham, Dean Bailey, Dean Brown, Mr. Jackson, Mr. Gill, Mr.
Hengeveld, or those of certain other faculty or Board of Trustee members may immediately come to mind. All of these
men, of course, perform vital functions and the college could not run smoothly without them, but there is another group
which very seldom receives the praise it deserves—the men who work under the direction of our capable and efficient Superintendent
of Grounds and Buildings, Mr. F. D. Hobart.

The duties of the men of this department are varied and many. They supply us with the things which we
never think of except when we cannot use and enjoy them—the electric lights, the hot water, the heat for the
dormitories and the classrooms, and so on. The fact that we seldom find ourselves without hot water, lights, or heat
is in itself a tribute to the diligence and the alertness of these men. In addition, a continuous survey is
made of the conditions of the college buildings, and all defects are remedied as soon as they are discovered in
most cases. Many other large and small chores requiring a knowledge of carpentry are done daily also.

As Mr. Hobart’s official title indicates, his duties are not restricted to the buildings on the campus, but also include
the maintenance of the grounds. This work is carried on in each season and under all conditions, and is of
a very vital nature. Although the importance of this group is often overlooked, the students of Davidson owe Mr. Hobart
and his men a vote of thanks for services rendered. We should make an honest effort to cooperate with them
whenever possible.

Think It Over
By MALLOY OWEN

Chances for Peace

In a poll of student-faculty opinion taken on this campus last week, 71 percent believed that the U.S. and the
U.S.S.R. will fight. Is it that we Americans have at last learned not to stick our heads in the sand
and deny that tyrants are tyrants just because we don’t want to believe it, or is it what so many
left-wingers say—mere propaganda hysteria? It is very evident, we believe, that if events continue to follow their current course, war
IS coming. One of the most absurd accusations we have heard is the ridiculous declaration that if enough Americans keep
saying there will be a war, that they will bring it on by just saying so. This same trend of
events occurred in 1939, but their denials only aided the dictators' plans for war and world conquest.

To Be or Not To Be

With all due apologies to one William Shakespeare, the above oft-quoted phrase is being borrowed because it clearly sets forth
a question which the officials of Davidson College must face squarely within a few weeks. The problem facing the administration,
the alumni, and for that matter the student body as a whole, has been brought to a head by the
recent developments in the Southern Conference. The question is: What should Davidson do about its athletic policy?

Some students and alumni feel that we should go all out to build fine teams in all sports—that we should
relax the academic standards in order to keep all athletes in school—and so on. This, too, is not in keeping
with the Davidson tradition and certainly cannot be called a solution. Not even a Davidson coach has ever advocated this,
nor do many of the college’s supporters wish to see it tried. After all, we are not in business to
compete with outfits like Clipper U, and the college’s primary purpose is still to endeavor to educate those who attend
it.

What then should we do? It seems that the general desire is for Davidson to make every effort to maintain
its present position in the conference. It may be necessary to increase the size of our scholarships to make this
possible, but no one should object to that. This means that we want to continue to play against the smaller
schools on the gridiron plus one or two of the bigger powers each year, and to compete against all comers
in the other sports that the Wildcat teams participate in. At the same time, we, with the help of those
schools who share our views about subsidization of athletics, can continue to strive to persuade the non-believers to join us
in outlawing many of the practices now sanctioned or overlooked as the various colleges vie for talent. Gradually we may
be able to make the Southern Conference one in which at least those who desire to do so will be
able to compete on an equal basis. This may sound strange but even today some colleges offer so little financial
aid to deserving athletes that they must seek help elsewhere. By then setting maximum and minimum limits on all scholarships
we can again have a conference where all members can compete with each other on an equal basis. Of course,
we may find it impossible to put over our “reforms”—in which case more drastic action may be necessary—but why not
try first? After all, we have nothing to lose and much to gain.
