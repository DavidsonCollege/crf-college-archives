**You can go home again: Holland to return as Davidson’s A.D.**

By GARY WHEELER

Terry Holland, former Davidson basketball player and coach, will return to Davidson as the director of athletics effective May 1, 1990. Holland’s appointment was announced at a news conference in the Knobloch Tennis Center on June 23.

Holland will replace Kit Morris, who resigned in early June. Sterling Martin, former assistant director of athletics, will serve as the interim director while Holland coaches one more season at the University of Virginia.

“I guess my only qualifications are my great love for this institution and the notoriety I will bring to Davidson,” Terry Holland said at the June press conference announcing his decision.

In leaving Virginia, Holland will be leaving a high-profile, high-paying job. He sees his sacrifices of notoriety and money as Davidson's gain.

“Let's face it,” he told The Davidsonian in a telephone interview, “my hiring is an effort to improve Davidson's public image.”

Holland is best known for coaching the University of Virginia championship team. In his 15 years as head coach, the Cavaliers maintained an impressive 306-161 record. During the time that Holland served as head coach of Davidson basketball, 1969-74, the Wildcats had a record of 92-43. Holland was a member of Davidson’s basketball team from 1961-64.

“I won't stand up here and tell you about my qualifications,” Holland said in his news conference. “I can tell you that I have none as an administrator. I guess my only qualifications are my great love for this institution and the notoriety I will bring to Davidson.”

Club reports that Holland’s announcement to return has already helped fundraising. Assistant director Jane Wellford said that the CCRL (Council on Campus and Religious Life) met with Dean of Students Will Terry to explore the possible ways in which condoms might be made available. Ideas included: condoms in first aid boxes, vending machines that included condoms.

Emil Parker, assistant athletic director of communications, said that Holland will bring “instant credibility” to Davidson athletics.

Holland will, however, face some more concrete problems upon his arrival. He cited conference affiliation as his number one priority, and said women’s sports must grow “to Title IX requirements and beyond.”

Despite his inexperience in administration, Holland is confident that he and the rest of the athletic department can build women’s sports “from the ground up.”

“I have had a chance to meet with most of the coaches, and I’m impressed with the staff,” he commented.

**Condom controversy continues!**

**Davidson chooses compromise**

By GARY WHEELER

There will be no condom machines in dorm bathrooms this year, but condoms are available to students through the infirmary, the athletic training room, and hall counselors and resident advisors who volunteer to distribute them.

The condoms are in envelopes which read, “This distribution is for the prevention of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. Condoms are NOT 100% effective. Abstinence is the only 100% effective preventative [sic].”

Wellford, a member of the Student Health and Concerns Committee (SHOC), is unhappy with the route the administration chose to take in handling condom distribution. She considers the administration’s actions to be a “false gesture” and “more of a joke than anything else,” she said. Wellford said that she cannot imagine most people approaching their hall counselors or resident advisors for condoms. “Probably only a few bold upperclassmen would do that,” she stated.

The campaign for condoms began last spring when the Student Action Committee (renamed SHOC) petitioned for students in favor of having 24-hour access to condoms on campus. Seventy-two percent of those responding indicated that they supported some type of 24-hour, on-campus access to condoms.

Wellford said that the CCRL (Council on Campus and Religious Life) met with Dean of Students Will Terry to explore the possible ways in which condoms might be made available. Ideas included: condoms in first aid boxes, vending machines that included condoms.
