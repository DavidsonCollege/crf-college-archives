6 THE DAVIDSONIAN OPINIONS THURSDAY: OCTOBER 25, 1990

Notes on Calendar Changes and the Great Towing Controversy

By DAVID SCOTT '92

Proposed changes in the academic calendar and the increasing tendency for illegally parked cars to get towed have inspired heated columns and letters to the editor in recent issues of the Davidsonian. This is fine. The Opinions page should allow students to say what they feel. However, much emotionalism and few facts seem to be fanning the flames of controversy. As a public service announcement, the editors would like to present a few of the latter for future debate.

First on the legend of the expanding calendar. Professor Randy Nelson of the English Department serves as secretary of the Executive Council. This body determines how the academic calendar will be structured in order to encompass fifteen weeks of classes along with vacations, orientation, exams, etc. The calendar in question is for the 1992-93 academic year. It is a misconception, Dr. Nelson emphasized, that this committee can change the number of academic weeks in a semester. It is, however, responsible for the arrangement of the schedule. Nelson stated that the current calendar “allows eighteen weeks to cover fifteen weeks of academic work including holidays,” etc. The 1992-93 calendar will cover the same fifteen weeks of class time in seventeen actual weeks. Among the benefits would be an extended summer vacation which has been a concern expressed by students especially when seeking summer employment. The committee focused on cutting the time allotted to extra-academic functions such as orientation and the exam period. At the behest of students, Christmas, Fall, and Spring breaks will remain uncut.

To evaluate the proposed changes in the exam period consider: in the fall of 1992 classes will end on Friday, December 11. Saturday is a reading day. Exams begin Monday, December 14 and end Friday, the eighteenth. This Fall classes end Monday the tenth. Tuesday is a reading day, exams begin on Wednesday and end on Wednesday the nineteenth. Changes in the number of academic weeks in a semester are currently under consideration but not by the Executive Council. Such decisions fall under the jurisdiction of the Educational Policy Committee. The committee is currently considering the possibility of switching to a thirteen or fourteen week academic semester calendar. Any proposal from this committee will go to the floor for a faculty vote.

Now onto the towing or, more specifically, Bob Collins controversy. Mr. Collins came to Davidson last spring after eleven years at the Citadel and nine years as their physical plant director. Collins is NOT officially in charge of the towing of illegally parked automobiles on the Davidson campus. This is the responsibility of the Department of Public Safety under Ray Thrower. Collins stated that his only contact with the situation entailed calling Mr. Thrower earlier this year and saying that something had to be done about illegally parked cars when an emergency vehicle was unable to get to a dorm one night because of crowded roadways.

Collins has already demonstrated his ability to get things done (and reduce the impetus for illegal parking) by building the new parking lots across from Richardson. He has also improved the campus lighting system. In an interview in his office, Mr. Collins emphasized the need for basic organizational changes in the physical plant and facilities management. This need, he stressed, involves everyone from the physical plant employees to the administration, students, and the fraternity houses. Concerning the physical plant itself, Collins sees too much inefficiency.in the management of labor. Too many people, he feels, are doing too little. He plans to institute engineered working schedules and time profiles giving each employee a specific area of responsibility. He admits that this may cause some tensions with workers in the near future but feels such actions are necessary. Further, Collins feels that students need to take greater responsibility for their actions. Of fraternities he stated, “If students are going to be in control then they need to control.” He wants houses to outline more detailed areas of responsibility for members and fulfill them more thoroughly. He emphasized cleanup after parties, especially outdoor parties, as a particular area in need of improvement. He also feels that, because of organizational inconsistencies, some of the houses are not providing a sanitary environment for food service, and he feels this must change. Collins further admitted that the college has not lived up to its own administrative responsibilities concerning the maintenance of the houses. Some have structural weaknesses or need new roofs and the college has not adequately addressed these issues. Collins hopes to meet with the officers of all the houses sometime this year to discuss all these problems and evaluate current attitudes and expectations which he feels need revision. 

“I’m for democracy,” stated Collins. “I think a democratic system can work, and I’m open for suggestions. But I can be autocratic if the results demand it. If I have to, I can make a decision. That’s one thing I’m good at.” Collins recognizes that he may not be a popular man. He stated, however, that if people think there is a better way to get things done they should gather up some facts and come see him rather than rely on second-hand information. As he put it, “I’m here to ask the right questions.” If no one else answers, Mr. Collins seems ready to fill in the blanks.
