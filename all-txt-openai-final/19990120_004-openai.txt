NEH will fund the study of motivation by prodigious Davidson philosopher underpinnings of human actions, including self-control, self-deception, and intention.
He believes that his new NEH-funded research will forge a link between many of his previous ideas through its study
of motivation. He said, “there’s been a dispute for hundreds of years over whether judging that you have a moral
obligation to do something entails having the motivation to do it. I claim that you can believe that you should
do something and still have no motivation at all to do it, that motivation isn’t intrinsic to moral judgments. But
you can’t really settle the issue until you have a clear idea of what motivation is. In 2,500 years, no
one has proposed a comprehensive theory of motivation that’s acceptable to me!”

By posting a coherent theory of motivation, Mele believes he can unify many different areas of philosophy—including ethics, self-deception, action
theory, and free will. The details of his ideas, as written down in his fellowship application, rely on technical language
far beyond the comprehension level of most armchair philosophers. For instance, he writes, “an essentially motivation-constituting attitude constitutes motivation not
only in the agent’s actual situation but also in all possible College Relations.”

Despite centuries of philosophical discussions around campfires, in late-night dorm rooms, and in halls of justice and state, questions in
the field persist and debate rages on. The essential question of humanity’s purpose on earth continues to confound and fascinate
laypeople, but few probe the depths of the subject with the tenacity and enthusiasm of Davidson College philosopher Alfred R.
Mele. In recognition of his eminence in the field, the National Endowment for the Humanities recently granted Mele $30,000 through
its Fellowships for College Teachers and Independent Scholars program so that he can construct a unified theory of human motivation.
The grant will allow Mele, Davidson’s Vail Professor of Philosophy, to take a full year’s sabbatical during the 1999-2000 academic
year to write a book that he has tentatively titled, “Motivation in Action and Belief.”

Mele was one of just 86 individuals approved for NEH fellowships among 807 who applied. It is also the third
NEH fellowship he has received in his 19 years at Davidson, in addition to five other NEH summer stipends and
seminar grants. The agency, and colleagues in the field, recognize that Mele’s appetite for philosophical inquiry is outstanding and his
academic productivity is staggering. His five previous books were all published by Oxford University Press, the most prestigious name in
the business. He has also written about 90 journal articles, as well as scores of reviews and entries for academic
journals, encyclopedias, and dictionaries, and has traveled worldwide as an invited speaker at professional meetings. This year also he lectured
in Finland, Sweden, and Portugal.

was that the amount of women self-selecting was divided by four due to the addition of Turner House. Instead of
turning in their forms during winter exams, men waited to self-select in January this year. Barber explained that the Patterson
Court Council voted for the change because it is easier to process the men’s and women’s forms at the same
time and it relieves men from the pressure of deciding during exams. Another change was the new alcohol policy. Barber
stated, “Self-Selection is probably the biggest night that has been affected by the changes that went into effect this year.”
Due to the new policy, this year was the first which formally required risk managers, riders, and bartenders to attend
all of the houses’ parties. Barber felt confident in the leadership and planning of all the houses: “all of the
groups have done a great job in organizing events and making sure that everything was safe.” He continued, “we’ve worked
really hard this year to give people the information they need to make smart decisions.” Barber thanked the houses for
their efforts. Participants in Self-Selection reported that they enjoyed the event.

scenarios in which the agent has the attitude.” His application outlines ten distinct chapters he will use to construct a
coherent picture of motivation in our lives. Among many other points, he will explore the distinction between attitudes that are
essentially motivational and ones that are contingently motivational, whether judging that you have a moral obligation to do something entails
having the motivation to do it, and the influence of motivation on free will and belief. It’s not a book
intended for lay audiences, but should be well received by his fellow philosophers of mind and action, metaphysicians, moral philosophers,
some psychologists and students. Though few non-professionals can understand his arguments, his enthusiasm for the work is easily recognized. “I
love it, it’s true,” he said. “I’m excited about doing it every day. I really like solving these problems.” His
childhood friends might be shocked to hear that, though. Mele was an all-state linebacker in Michigan in high school, and
attended Wayne State University with full intentions of continuing his athletic career. But early in college he became enchanted with
exercising his mind, and the only remnant of his athletic career now is his fierce competitiveness on the racquetball court.
Mele graduated from Wayne State with high distinction, and went on to earn his Ph.D. in philosophy from the University
of Michigan in 1979. He has spent his entire teaching career at Davidson. Mele now spends his days surrounded by
books. He carries a notebook to the office and home and jots down ideas as they occur to him. The
notes resolve themselves into problems that he attacks through thought and research during most of his waking hours. The problems
become fruit for journal articles or essays, and as he discovers links between several problems he begins creating the outline
for a book. He relishes the opportunity the NEH fellowship will allow to concentrate on his ideas day and night,
uninterrupted by the time-consuming duties of collegiate teaching. Though he will write it in Davidson, he will travel this coming
summer to the Australian National University in Canberra as a research fellow to study with Professor Michael Smith, another leading
international motivational theorist. Not that he has anything against teaching, though. Mele could easily hold a position at a graduate
institution that carries a far lighter load of teaching than his Davidson load. But he has remained at Davidson because
he enjoys watching undergraduates gain a more profound appreciation and understanding for the social science that they all practice on
an amateur level. He teaches his specialty, the history of ancient philosophy, every year, as well as the first-year “Humanities”
course that introduces students to the history of Western thought. He also teaches a colloquium for senior philosophy majors and
a course in the philosophy of religion.

Noted pianist Ruskin Cooper will present recital

Press RELEASE College Relations

Distinguished chamber musician and solo recitalist Ruskin Cooper will present a free piano recital at Davidson College on Thursday, January
21. The recital will begin at 8 PM in Hodson Hall of the Cunningham Fine Arts Building at Davidson College.
Cooper’s program will include Mozart’s Sonata in C Major, KV 309 and 15 Variations and Fugue “Eroica” by Beethoven. It
will conclude with Robert Schumann’s Carnival, Op. 35. Cooper is currently on the piano faculties at Davidson and Salem Colleges.
He is a native of Savannah, GA, who received musical training at the Oberlin Conservatory and University of South Florida.
In 1981, he received a Fulbright Grant for study at the Hochschule für Musik in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, where
he studied solo piano, chamber music, and song interpretation. In 1984, he received the Diploma with High Honors in Frankfurt.
From 1985-1991, Cooper was on the faculty of the North Carolina School of the Arts, and in 1996 he received
his Doctor of Musical Arts from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. His doctoral dissertation on Robert Schumann's colleague
and friend Ludwig Schuncke received the Outstanding Dissertation Award at UNCG in 1996. He published the dissertation in 1997 under
the title Robert Schumann's Closest ‘Jugendfreund:’ Ludwig Schuncke (1810-1834) (Fisher & Partner, Hamburg).

College Communications

Cooper returns to Europe on a regular basis for performances. In 1989, he recorded a program of sonatinas for the
Südwestfunk in Baden-Baden. His interpretations, particularly of American music, have been enthusiastically received in Germany, Italy, and Poland, as well
as in the United States.
