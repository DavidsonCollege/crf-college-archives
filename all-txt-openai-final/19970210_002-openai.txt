Note: “Number of students” figures indicate only those students studying on campus for that semester. Also, in the fall of
1995, The Davidsonian published a list of average GPAs by department from the Spring 1995 semester. After months of trying
to obtain the same information for the 1995-96 academic year, as well as the Fall 1996 semester, the Registrar’s and
Dean of Academic Affairs Offices said they would not release the numbers, per an informal poll of department chairs, who
said the information would not be conclusive, and therefore not helpful. These charts show what The Davidsonian was able to
obtain instead.

FCA and IVCF sponsor youth event for fellowship

By ELIZABETH BLACKBURN

Last Thursday, 350 people gathered together in Johnston gym for a night of Barbeque, song, fellowship, and fun. Fellowship of
Christian Athletes, or FCA, and Intervarsity Christian Fellowship sponsored a free barbecue dinner for Charlotte and Davidson youth groups and
the rest of campus. The message of the night was “Being a Christian in College.”

Freshman Elizabeth Clasen felt that the evening presented an important and universal message, “It is very important for the Christians
on campus to be united and break down divisions between the Christian organizations so that we can all come together
and worship the same Lord.”

Members of Davidson FCA served dinner at 5:30. This dinner proved to be a perfect time for people of all
ages who may have never met to come together in a casual atmosphere.

Three women enjoy food and fellowship at an FCA and IVCF sponsored event Thursday night.

Following the barbeque dinner, everyone gathered on the bleachers to sing various Christian songs and to hear speakers. Junior Lindsay
Maney started off the evening sharing her experience of becoming a child of God at a young age and what
that has meant over the past two and a half years at Davidson. Following Maney, Clasen spoke of how Christianity
has impacted her life over the past several months and the comfort that her Christian family and her faith in
God provided her as she made the transition into college life. Junior Eric Sapp, President of FCA, brought the discussion
to a close with the message that college is a time for fun and for new experiences and that to
be a Christian at college does not close the door to “the good times.” After dinner, everyone went to Baker
to cheer the Wildcats on to basketball victory.

In focus ... NEW PROFESSOR

Amanto teaches economic problem solving

By JENNIFER STARR
Staff Writer

Although Intermediate Microeconomics is the first class that Dr. Ted Amanto has taught at Davidson, he is not a newcomer
to the community. He and his wife have lived in Davidson for three years and teach at UNC-Charlotte. In his
opinion, Davidson students are incredibly polite and represent the college well.

Amanto discovered his love of economics almost by accident. As an undergraduate student at Lenoir-Rhyne College, Amanto planned to go
to law school. He was walking up the stairs of the Administration Building to declare history as his major when
he met an admissions counselor.

Upon hearing Amanto’s plans, the admissions counselor suggested that economics might be a good major for a pre-law student. Amanto
signed up for economics “on a lark,” and fell in love with the subject after his first class. He says,
“(Economics) offered a framework for analyzing problems and questions which I had been pondering.” After receiving his Ph.D. from the
University of South Carolina, Amanto began teaching. He hopes that students in his classes will come to share his love
of economics. “Ideally, they [my students] would develop the same passion for economics which I have... At a minimum, I
hope they gain an appreciation for the economic way of viewing problems,” he says. Amanto chose to teach at Davidson
because of the opportunity to work more closely with colleagues whom he admires and the chance to do something different.
He feels that there is a “radical difference” in the campus environment of UNCC, which has a sizeable number of
off-campus and part-time students, and Davidson. In addition to economics, Amanto is fond of cycling, South Carolina football, and cats.
He was born in Edmonton, Alberta and has lived in Maryland, Montreal, and South Carolina.
