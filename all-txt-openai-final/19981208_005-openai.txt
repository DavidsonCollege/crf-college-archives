As always, when the end of the first semester draws near, two realities begin to dawn upon the Davidson population. The first is the fact that the workload increases in such dramatic proportions that it is necessary for students to find new and inventive ways to put off writing that ten-page research paper for just a few more minutes. The second is that the holiday season begins at Davidson the moment the townsfolk put up those “Christmas in Davidson” banners on every street lamp that lines Main Street, and that it is necessary to decorate one’s room or hall in the spirit of the aforementioned season. However, there are a number of students who don’t realize that the ingenious procrastination technique of decorating for the holidays can actually help in your studies, if done in certain ways. So, as a service to that school, I’m going to supply you with just a handful of the many ways that decorating for the holidays can aid in your education while here at Davidson. Below, you will find a list, by subject, of some of the projects that you can do in order to prepare yourself for final exams while you are bringing the joys of the holidays to your hall at the same time.

**Chemistry and Decorating the Christmas Tree:**
Finding the perfect ornaments for one’s Christmas tree can be rather difficult, depending upon when you shop and your personal tastes. While we can always rely on the ever-faithful glass bulbs in shades of blue, green, red, silver, and gold, sometimes you just might want something a little more special and original. Through the miracle of Styrofoam balls of various sizes, acrylic paint, and super glue, we can kill two birds with one stone. For those of you who have a chemistry final coming up but also want to get that tree decorated, why not make molecular ornaments? While they might not be the standard decoration, you can garner valuable knowledge about bond angles as you put hydrogen and carbon atoms together to form a methane molecule, or oxygen and hydrogen in forming the life-giving liquid, water. Through your gluing and painting, you can learn about the tetrahedral organization of various atoms or the mystifying effects of a lone pair.

**English and Caroling Through the Town:**
Bringing the joy of the season to others is a common practice by a number of students. Often at this time of year, small gatherings of friends have gotten together to sing Christmas carols throughout the town and campus. While a number of studious individuals have been adverse to participating in these activities or listening to the great music provided, it should be realized that a great deal of learning can come from these songs of happiness. For those of you who are preparing for a final in a poetry or short story analysis course, why not look at the Christmas carol for a little practice? A number of songs have a special underlying meaning that can only be discovered through careful interpretation (read, reading between the lines). In “Deck the Halls,” try to establish why this Hall family deserves to be beaten with branches from a tree. In “We Wish You a Merry Christmas,” use context clues to learn why figgy pudding is so important and why guests become belligerent and participate in a sit-in, that is at least until they “get some.”

**Mathematics and Mistletoe:**
Mistletoe, a guy’s excuse to use the pressure of hundreds of years of tradition to attempt to get a member of the opposite gender to kiss him. While it is often received with a simple giggle or a retort like “Are you serious?” or “Over my dead and decaying body,” mistletoe has the ability to open the door to a variety of opportunities. Why shouldn’t one of those opportunities involve a little math review? For example, one might want to attempt to find exactly how many sprigs of mistletoe are necessary to hang from the ceiling of one’s hall in order to receive one kiss from a member of the opposite gender, wherein the initiator is either male or female. After thoughtful calculations and some simple data gathering, I’m sure that someone could develop a function which would give them the appropriate answer. Another example involves the hypothesis, “If I hang mistletoe from my door,” and the conclusion, “then I will receive a kiss from a member of the opposite gender.” Attempting to prove this statement true, one may find only a counterexample and then have to deem the statement false. In any form, however, one would be able to practice a little bit of math while carrying on a tradition from our past.

**Biology and the Flora of the Season:**
While preparing for your edible plants final or just trying to get an idea of what makes up the living organisms of this planet, why not take a moment and look at the plants that fit in with the holiday season? At this time of year, poinsettias and sprigs of mistletoe make their appearance with pine trees in abundant quantities. So, with all of this research material readily available, looking into why these plants are poisonous may be a good idea. Using the berries from a sprig of mistletoe, try to determine how long it takes for the poison in the berries to bring on medical problems from nausea to the complete shutdown of the human biological system. While testing on your roommate may be considered a Code of Responsibility violation and, insome states, illegal, using small enough quantities may ensure some results towards the friendlier side of the spectrum of analysis. Not putting up mistletoe for the hall? Maybe you should look into decorating with a poinsettia or two. In the many wonderful and vibrant colors that they come in, these flowers offer you a chance to brighten up your room and look into the horrific effects of poison at the same time. Following the same research methods as before or coming up with a new technique will be a great way to prepare for your final. All in all, as the semester comes to a close and we find ourselves scrambling to get the decorations up for the holiday season, keep in mind that there are ways to bring both of these hectic events into a simple and useful method of procrastination. While you might not find them useful now, who knows, maybe when you’re studying for the electronics test and you look at your Christmas lights dangling around your room, you'll be able to answer that age-old question, “Why the hell are they blinking?” and you'll realize that both the holidays and finals can be celebrated together.

Get the most out of procrastination: decorate

We are in a Material World

While on turkey break in Atlanta, my sister and I were hit on by two guys who lived in a car at the mall. Sketchy, I know, but intriguing at the same time. The guys were living in a new red Volkswagen Beetle for a contest sponsored by a radio station. Out of the original eight individuals chosen to live in the two Beetles, the two remaining the longest won the Beetles. Last year the same radio station’s car contest consisted of riding a rollercoaster over and over again. After six weeks, the station decided each of the four individuals deserved a car and each received a new Ford Ranger. This year they called it quits as well and held a drawing between the four for the two Beetles. Perhaps they have learned the dedication of their contest participants; at Thanksgiving, reaching the four-week mark, the contestants claimed they were staying until Christmas.

It’s pretty hard for me to imagine putting my entire life on hold to win a car. The participant practically becomes an amoeba relying on the family to provide meals and the boss to understand why he or she will not be at work for an indeterminable period of time, not to mention any relationships or other obligations that must be shelved. I definitely think it had begun to affect the participants when we saw them, in part because of the mutual relationship they had developed with the car. (I mention the fact they hit on us to add humor only; by this point, they probably would have hit on my dog. When I commented on the difficulty of having a relationship when one lived in a car at the mall, the two responded by assuring me they would take us to the Bahamas after they won the car. I concluded the strain of their limited lifestyle had seriously begun to take a toll on their mental well-being.)

Even further, by the time you won the car, I would venture to say you have become either hopelessly attached or dreadfully sick of the vehicle. The car might be yours, but it would at the very least still smell like the three people who lived in it with you. The Car People, as they became known, thrived or absorbed even their energy from the constant attention they received from passersby who marveled at their determination and idiocy, and the notoriety they achieved on the television news programs, in the paper, and in the small talk around Atlanta. All this for a car. Granted, it’s a new (well, slightly lived-in) Beetle, but c’mon — it’s a piece of steel that goes from point A to point B. As Madonna says, we know that we are living in a material world. But how far have we advanced as a society if people will sacrifice their very freedom for a means of transportation? Our ability to reason logically is what separates us from other animals. While I applaud the determination of these individuals, I shudder to think of the strain it would put on everything that cared about them. In the commercial hoopla that surrounds the holiday season, pause to remember exactly what your actions indicate you are celebrating. Transportation-wise, the Car People make me more appreciative of the Vamanos Van. Lifestyle-wise, the Car People force me to re-evaluate how far I would go for a material possession.
