DAVIDSON COLLEGE

All Hail, O Davidson!

All hail! O Davidson, Our dear old Alma Mater,
Our Fathers loved thee, gave their best to thee;
And still today their loyal sons undaunted,
Follow them on, and pledge their loyalty.

PRESENT CHURCH

All hail! O Davidson, Thy classic halls are standing,
Type of the faith of those who founded thee:
Casting their spell upon thy sons enchanted,
Holding them still, in faith and loyalty.

All hail! O Davidson, One-hundred years behind thee,
Still pressing on to glories yet to be:
Thy stalwart sons in serried ranks behind thee,
Our voices raise, in hymns of loyalty.

President
