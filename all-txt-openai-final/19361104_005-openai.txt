DAVIDSON WILDCATS DEFEATED BY FURMAN

Cross-Country Team Will Meet Lees-McRae Junior College in Race

CAROLINA TEAMS NEXT

Varsity and Freshmen Will Race Tar Heels Nov. 13

The freshman cross-country team will meet the Lees-McRae Junior College team here next Saturday morning. The Freshmen defeated Guilford here
last Saturday by a score of 16-37. Pete Lafferty, former Davidson track star, is coach of the Lees-McRae cross-country team.
Coach “Pete” Whittle says that Lees-McRae has always had a good team, and it has plenty of pep this year.

Those Freshmen who will probably run for Davidson in the meet on Saturday are: Fitzgerald, Dick Gammon, Joe Gammon, Gilliam,
Kellog, Kenyon, Miller, and McFadyen. The next meet for the varsity cross-country team will be on November 13th, when both
the Freshmen and the varsity meet the Carolina cross-country team here. The varsity has had two matches so far this
year, having won from Guilford and lost to Duke University.

OUTLOOK BRIGHT FOR 1937

Boggs, Sloan, Woodward and Jones Show Form

In a closely fought match that went to four sets, Carl Carlson, captain-elect of the Varsity Netmen who was seeded
number two, exhibited excellent playing form to defeat the top-ranking Bronston Kenney by the scores of 6-2, 4-6, 6-2 in
the final round to win the annual fall tennis tournament for upper classes.

Nipping the sidelines with hard forehand smashes, Carlson won the first two sets after a hard fight. Kenney came to
life during the third set and, getting control of his shots, crashed in on Carlson's letdown in play and chased
the captain-elect all over the court with blistering placement and drop shots. Carlson opened up and ran through the last
set in quick order. Using change of pace with well-placed lobs and smashing drives, Carlson completely outclassed the tired but
fighting Kenney, who staved off set point several times before falling victim to a hard drive just out of his
reach.

Carlson romped to the finals by taking Northern, King, and Sloan into camp with little trouble, while Kenney...
