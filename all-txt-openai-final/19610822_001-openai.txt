#### THE FINALE

The final Midweek Break is not going to feature any exotic-type chow. Rather, we will end up with a feature
that has met with steady approval - hot dogs with all the condiments.

The staff has enjoyed sponsoring the breaks, and we hope that they have been as much a pleasure to those
who have attended. A special note of thanks is due to Jean Abernathy and Steve Bender who have worked on
these breaks. Jean has provided the “woman's touch" and Steve the strong back that have played a great part in
the success of the breaks (any lack of success can be laid to administrative error).

#### THE FINALE PAST

Dave Simpson brought his film season to an end with a bang. Better than half of the student body was
in attendance to see BB try to make up her loss to Mr. Bolgac's estate.

The film program this summer has been a great aid and morale booster to those of us who have been
here since early June.

#### THE FINALE TO COME

The staff has found an almost fool-proof method of acing that old exam, and we pass it along to you
now. One starts on the first day of classes and studies nine hours a day. We have heard that this
is an effective way to ease the pain of an exam.

#### SUMMER GRADUATION

For: G.P. Nowlin

#### THE FINALE?

Professor Griffin said to me of his classes this summer, "Gentlemen, this is the end of the last class, but
it is not the end of the lesson."

I had a talk with a friend who was recently graduated from Davidson and has gone to work for a
Charlotte firm. He said, "I have learned more here in a few months than I learned in a full four
years at Davidson.”

I suppose that we will have to be graduated and gone from Davidson for some time before we realize the
true significance of these statements. I would suggest this, however: We will leave Davidson at the end of our time
having learned nothing but how to learn.

If this is true, then Davidson has accomplished her mission. We will then go into the world as graduates in
a liberal arts program who are prepared to learn the overwhelmingly hard lessons that the world has to teach us.

Now we debate the Berlin crisis in an academic fashion, for it only seems to threaten a cloudy past that
surrounds our parents and the world outside Davidson. But when we face the world and try to make our way,
we will find that Berlin is a threat to us in our new way of life, separate from our parents.

Then, we will apply our ability to learn and understand to our problems as they face us and not as
we read of them in texts and newspapers. Until I can really know the truth, I would suggest that this
is the true significance of the two statements that lead this editorial.
