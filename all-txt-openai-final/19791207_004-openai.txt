**THE DAVIDSONIAN**

Founded 1914

In the midst of all the faculty evaluation furor, it is important to consider just what students think makes a
good teacher. Most students, when asked, will think for a minute and then laugh when they realize that they just
can't articulate what they think makes a professor excellent. I, too, have trouble articulating what makes a good professor. My
idea of a good teacher has little to do with the daily mechanics of teaching and lots to do with
how the professor approaches life.

Teachers who search for the mysteries in their subject and are not afraid (indeed they are even eager) to grapple
with them. Teachers that seem to have all the answers are the ones that inspire me the least. It is
an oft-stated fact that the more one learns, the more one realizes how ignorant he is. Professors are important to
students because they, instead of feeling defeated, are spurred on by challenge. They have chosen to live lives bent on
making a dent in their ignorance. Professors need to make it clear that they know more than the students and
that they are in charge of the course and its direction. Student ideas should be used as springboards for other
avenues of exploration. Student comments should never become the driving force behind any course. Nothing is more frustrating than constantly
getting entertained rather than stimulated. Entertainment is momentarily enjoyable while stimulation is forever frustrating. A professor who constantly entertains is
cheating everyone in the class.

Other students' conceptions of what makes a good teacher often conflict with my ideas. "I personally like profs that make
learning effortless and enjoyable," said Michael Busch, senior class president. "I don’t believe in the ‘no pain no gain’ theory
that is prevalent among Davidson professors." And some concur: "Teachers should push students to the limits of their ability," stated
John Jackson, SGA President, "but should be very sensitive to what that limit is."

Almost anyone’s list of attributes of a good professor would include enthusiastic, organized, inspiring, responsible, and concerned. Just exactly how
these are expressed through teaching varies with the field, the course, and the professor. Some students demand more. Senior Rick
Johnston includes factors like "accessible to students," "plays an active role in non-academic affairs of the college," and "grades fairly"
in his list of characteristics of a good professor. He also feels a good professor "turns back tests and papers
on time—why should I feel the need to keep up with my work in a course if the professor is
not able to keep up with his responsibilities?"

Student ideas about what makes a professor good are probably as varied as faculty ideas about what constitutes good teaching.
But few in either group would argue with Jim Haynes’ definition of a good professor. The senior class senator believes
that "A good teacher is one who can instill in students an almost insatiable desire to learn, and then point
them along the way to satisfying that desire." The problem is, how can we measure something that nebulous? We must
measure it if it is that important.

**Social Life At Davidson**

To the Editor:

The social life here at Davidson is an important part of our learning experience. Unfortunately, the social scene at our
fair college is not always what it could be. This problem is no one’s fault but our own. I am
amazed at how many people approach a Davidson party on a weekend here with...a negative, condescending attitude. I have noticed
that many Davidsonians feel that parties at D.C. are a "waste of time." I am further perturbed by the closed
social groups to which we all belong. In a small college, there is no reason that we should not be
more open. Granted that we are an unusual group. We all have diverse interests, ideas, and personalities, but as educated
people, we should learn to overcome our differences. Getting along with people is a valuable lesson that we should learn
here. To enjoy the differences that people offer is a step further. Socializing offers an opportunity for us to get
acquainted. I understand the problems some of us face. Too much work, the male-female ratio, and not enough enthusiasm are
standard criticisms of Davidson’s social scene. Each one of us makes up a part of the social life here, and
it is the responsibility of all 1300 of us to make it work. I believe that the Wildcat who does
not enjoy the social opportunities that we have is cheating himself. After all, what will you remember in ten or
twenty years—your organic chemistry, your macroeconomics, or the perfect ass? Get to know different people! The freshman hall party, the
fraternity keg party, the 900 Room disco, and even the five phi fly high parties are all opportunities to unwind
and meet new people. I think that you will be surprised to find many other nice people live here once
you break the ice.

The winter term at Davidson has traditionally been my least favorite term. The blue sky turns to gray, and students
seem to hibernate until spring break. The "winter bitch" descends on Davidson, draining the morale and initiative of the students.
I have seen it happen in the past. We can avoid it by keeping active. Break away from your routine,
try something new, enjoy a new group of friends, but most importantly, don’t become too serious about yourself.

Cambodia

To the Editor:

We are only remotely affected by the starvation of millions in Cambodia. Sure, many of us contribute money to the
relief efforts, but is money enough? It is a time for Christmas cheer and Christmas parties—and a need for serious
self-analysis. This week before Christmas, eating houses, clubs, and organizations will be throwing Christmas parties. This is great; there's nothing
wrong with sharing, talking, and being with friends. But when this sharing, talking, and being with friends revolves around excessive
eating and drinking, we question the necessity of celebrating in this fashion. Does an abundance of resources justify them? Is
our majority of humankind, which has no choice about lifestyle?

Solar Greenhouses

To the Editor:

We thank Mr. Ken Wood and the Davidson College students who helped to collect funds and materials for the Solar
Greenhouse constructed in Huntersville at the home of Earnest and Gertrude Williams. We also want to thank Mr. Ken Wood
and the students for their participation in the construction of the Solar Greenhouse. We hope that this project will be
a learning experience for all of us. Anyone in the area is welcome to come over to the Williams's home
for a tour of the Greenhouse and information concerning Solar Greenhouses.
