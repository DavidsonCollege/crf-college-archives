DR. MARTIN RETURNS.
At a meeting of the student body in Shearer Hall last Wednesday night, the proposed amendment to the constitution of student government providing that the words “or affirm” in brackets be inserted in the proper place in the oath required of all members of the student council, and that the concluding words of the oath “so help me God” be bracketed and made optional, failed to pass. An amendment to this amendment was proposed which provided that the concluding words remain the same but that the “or affirm” be inserted and that a clause be inserted requiring every member of the student council to take the stronger form of the oath unless he could show a valid reason for not wishing to do so. This, which was rejected as a part of the original measure, was then proposed as a new amendment, and is now under consideration for ten days, as is required by the constitution. Unless the meeting is postponed, the matter will come up again for final settlement on next Saturday, November 28.

Dr. Martin has just returned from quite an extensive trip in Georgia and Florida. He first visited Moultrie, Ga., where he addressed the Synod. After his address, several business men came to him and complimented him on Davidson's good work. The pastor, Rev. E. B. Meacham (’10), and his assistant, R. M. Pegram (’11), are doing very efficient work in Moultrie. Dr. Martin next visited Mr. Thomas Watt, at Thomasville. Mr. Will Watt, Mr. Watt's eldest son, is a trustee of the college. Sunday was spent at Valdosta, where he gave two sermons in the Presbyterian church. The pastor of this church is Rev. Mr. Bitzer. From Valdosta, Dr. Martin went to Jacksonville, Palatka, Deland, and Sanford, spending a day in each town. He spent Saturday, Sunday, and Monday in Tampa. He gave an address in the First Presbyterian church Sunday morning. From Tampa, he returned to the Florida Synod at Jacksonville. He gave two addresses before this body, one on our own college and the other on church work in general. Dr. Martin says that all the people are very much interested in Davidson and that they spoke to him especially on the good success of our football team.

NEW ENGLISH TEXTBOOK.

Dr. M. G. Fulton, Professor of English, has just arranged and edited a new English textbook entitled “College Life, Its Conditions and Problems.” He has compiled and edited this new volume, which is a collection of essays by college presidents and other prominent educators of the United States and England, primarily for use in college composition work, and as such, it is being used in the Freshman English course. As an introduction to each essay, he has given a brief account of the author's life and chief works, and immediately following it, he has carefully arranged a number of thought-suggestive topics for discussion and practice in writing. The new textbook differs from his “Expository Writing,” which was used in the Freshman English course last year, in that a majority of the essays deal with conditions and problems which relate directly to college life, which fact brings the subject nearer to the everyday life of the student and adds a new interest to the course.

NEW BOOKS IN LIBRARY.

The following new books have just been received in the library: “The Fine Arts,” Brown; “The Philosophy of the Beautiful,” Knight; “Poems,” Lanier; “Outlines of English Literature: Vol. II,” Landmarks; “Memorials and Legends of Georgia,” Knight; “Elimination of the Tramp,” Kelley; “The Teacher,” Palmer; “American-Japanese Problems,” Gulick; and “Student Standards of Action.”

DR. MINTER ADDRESSES THE Y. M. C. A.

Dr. W. R. Minter, of Lincolnton, addressed the Y. M. C. A. last Thursday night on the subject of gambling. This was the third subject in the series College Ideals. Dr. Minter developed his theme in a striking way and his clear, logical arguments against gambling will not be forgotten by the Davidson Student Body.

Are you doing your share to put the proper “pep” into Thursday's contest?
