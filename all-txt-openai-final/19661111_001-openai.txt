The Student Council is seeking non-voting student representation on the “Blue Sky Committee,” according to council president Chuck Matthews. Matthews said the student body should have a member on the committee, which is charged with considering all aspects of the college, “due to the value of our unique perspective on Davidson College life, our interest in and responsibility toward the college, and to ensure communication between students and faculty.”

Thus Student Body President Chuck Matthews summarized reasons why the Student Council is seeking to place a student on the faculty committee. The Student Curriculum Revision Committee, which parallels the faculty committee, met with the faculty committee Tuesday afternoon to discuss the proposal. A decision by the faculty committee is expected next week. Earlier the committee had voted not to allow student representation but agreed to discuss the matter with the Student Council committee and reconsider its decision.

“The faculty committee has expressed a desire to receive student opinion on curriculum revision,” Matthews commented. “If they want student opinion they should have a non-voting student member of the committee.”

At the invitation of Dean of Faculty Frontis W. Johnston, the Student Curriculum Revision Committee has met and decided to organize on the same lines as the faculty committee. If student representation is not allowed on the faculty committee, the student committee will serve as the indirect student voice with the faculty committee and will pass along suggestions made by students to the faculty committee.

The Student Curriculum Revision Committee believes that there are no “sacred cows,” that there is nothing so good at Davidson that it can’t be improved, Matthews remarked. They will consider three areas for improvement. First, courses, graduation requirements, major requirements, and other academic standards will come in for careful scrutiny, according to Matthews. “We will examine required courses especially hard,” he said. The committee will ask questions: Are students pampered at Davidson? If they had more seminars and independent study courses, might they not become creative thinkers and scholars rather than mere regurgitators of facts? What’s wrong with the faculty-administration and the students where so much emphasis has to be placed on the artificial apparatus of grades to make the educational system function?

Second, methods of presentation will be examined. “We feel that the lecture method is vastly overused,” Matthews stated. “More seminars and independent study courses are needed.”

Third, everything else in campus life will be discussed by the committee. Dormitory life, social life and fraternities, adequacy of the physical plant, the library, subsidized athletics, and ROTC will be among topics for scrutinization.

**Davidsonian Solicits $1 Study Donations**

THE DAVIDSONIAN will ask every student to give a dollar next week to a fund for the Student Council Curriculum Committee, to be used to finance research by the committee. The faculty’s Curriculum Committee has promised the student committee funds to carry out their independent work, but Student Body President Chuck Matthews is convinced the committee will need additional funds to do a thorough job. Such activities as deputations to schools experimenting with curriculum reforms, visiting speakers meeting with students and exchanging ideas, and correspondence with institutions and individuals involved in academic thought will require financial independence by the committee in order to be effective, he said.

A secondary motivation for the drive is to serve as an indication of student interest in the work of curriculum reform, according to DAVIDSONIAN staff members. “One of the main ideas of the drive is to get as wide a range of student participation as possible,” according to Managing Editor Bob Travers. “This is the reason we aren’t going to pressure anyone into giving any large sums—we’d rather have 600 people giving $600 than 200 people giving $600.”

Staff members will contact every student on campus during the first part of the week, and results will be tallied in time to be recorded in next week’s newspaper. “We’re hoping to get 100 percent participation in the drive,” commented Kern Parker, assistant managing editor. “It would be a tremendous morale booster to be able to start off this project with the knowledge that the entire student body was behind it.”

Matthews pointed out that it would be important for the student point of view to be presented in the curriculum study. Members of the faculty committee will be making their own trips to schools, Matthews explained, but their findings could possibly differ from those of the student. “It would be unfortunate if the efforts of the student committee were hindered by some.”

**Four Seasons Coming For Concert Weekend**

The Four Seasons with its “Gold Vault of Hits” will perform on campus Nov. 19 for Concert Weekend. Vince Foster, chairman of the Social Council, said that the Saturday of Concert Weekend would also feature a varsity football game against Wittenburg at 2 p.m. in Charlotte and a varsity-freshman basketball scrimmage in Johnston Gymnasium at 7 p.m. Saturday night, the Four Seasons will perform from 8:30 until 10:30 and will sing with their own back-up group,” Foster said. The concert will be held in Love Auditorium and will be open only to Davidson students and their dates. “We must have the concert where the audio will be good,” Foster added, but because “we just can’t seat all those who want to attend,” the concert will not be open to the public.

**Report Features STEP’s Growth**

THE DAVIDSONIAN report features this week a study of one of Davidson’s newest and most rapidly growing organizations, STEP—the Student Tutorial Education Program.

**Chaplain Will Assume New Duties Monday**

Monday morning the Chaplain’s office in the Union will be occupied for the first time since Will Terry’s resignation earlier this year. The Rev. Scott Woodmansee, a graduate of Davidson College, Class of ’59, will arrive on campus tomorrow and assume the duties of chaplain Monday. Woodmansee comes to Davidson from Collierville, Tenn., where he served as pastor of the Collierville Presbyterian Church. He replaces Terry, who resigned last spring to assume the pastorate of the Davidson College Presbyterian Church.

A native of Little Rock, Ark., Woodmansee graduated from Union Theological Seminary. While at Davidson, he won three football letters and two more in track. He served the YMCA as chairman of the Spiritual Life Committee and majored in psychology. He was a member of Phi Delta Theta. His wife is the former Priscilla Ann Shelby of Charlotte, a graduate of Queens College. They have two children. Woodmansee’s appointment was announced Oct. 13 by President D. Grier Martin. The announcement came after a careful search during the summer months for someone to fill the vacancy.

As chaplain he will take over the planning of all college religious services. In addition, he will assume the direction of the YMCA, coordination of all denominational student activities, and the direction of the chapel program. He will be available to the student body for personal counseling.

**Earl MacCormac Vespers Speaker**

Dr. Earl MacCormac, associate professor of philosophy, will deliver the meditation this Sunday evening at the Vespers Service. The day for the Vespers service has been changed from Wednesday to Sunday in accordance with previous plans. During the month of November all such services will begin at 7 p.m. on Sunday evening. The program is undergoing a period of experimental worship techniques. Art, music, and drama have been implemented into the service to give the program a different approach. In charge of this week’s service will be Paul Pitts.

Matthews delineated three reasons the Student Council feels that there should be non-voting student representation on the faculty committee. “First, this committee has such a wide range of study that what it decides will change the lives of future students. Because we do have the perspective of students we think we should have a voice. Also, students think that they have some good ideas. Second,” he continued, “students are interested in making Davidson College a better place. We don’task ‘for student representation not just because we exist at Davidson, but because we exist responsibly and care about Davidson. “This interest is illustrated by the 40 students who will speak to high schools to which the admissions office wouldn’t have time to go.” “Another example to prove student interest is that the Student Council will launch a mammoth drive to help with the Ford Foundation Challenge Grant program. Over the Christmas holidays, we will ask each student to make five new friends for Davidson College,” said Matthews.

The Student Council is now preparing a course evaluation for the end of the semester. The results will be given to each professor. The council is also preparing its own fund drive to raise money, to do research, and visit other campuses about curriculum revision.

Third, Matthews explained that one of the stated purposes of the faculty committee is to improve relations between faculty and students. “The committee is neglecting one of the goals it could most easily accomplish,” he said. “Is it right for the means of the evaluation to be immune from the goals of the evaluation?” “The committee is literally considering the whole school. We do not have the years of experience of the faculty, but we do have the immediate experience of the joys, sorrows, and frustrations of Davidson College educational experience which gives us a unique perspective which would be valuable for the committee.”

The Student Curriculum Revision Committee is beginning its research by reading the Danforth Report on 800 colleges, last year’s self-study, and the reply of the Southern Association of Colleges and Universities to Davidson's self-study. The student committee plans to use the results of its fund-raising drive to bring speakers from such schools as Antioch, Reed, and other progressive liberal arts colleges to Davidson to discuss curriculum. The faculty committee is considering placing some of its funds at the disposal of the student committee for this purpose.

After the student committee's fund drive, it will break up into subcommittees which will parallel the faculty subcommittees. These have been promised access to the faculty committee research materials. The student committee will do research and visit other campuses. Dean Johnston is chairman of the faculty committee which includes Professors J. H. Ostwalt, Joe Embry, Charles Ratliff, Earl MacCormac, Jim Martin, Locke White, Frank Bliss, and Max Polley.

Winter, Newsom To Edit Miscellany Publications Board Excludes Magazine

Ted Winter and Buddy Newsom were chosen co-editors of The Miscellany by the publication’s Board of Advisors Wednesday. Winter, a junior English major from Warrenton, Va., said, “We want to really establish The Miscellany, not only here, but also, hopefully, among other schools in the South. We feel the resignation and the change in policy are for continuity. Buddy and I will continue to work with Charlie.”

IFC To Contemplate Total Affiliation Offer

The Interfraternity Council announced at its meeting Monday night that it has set up a committee to consider a plan for total opportunity social affiliation as a part of rush in 1967-68. The committee plans to meet once a week until they have come up with a workable plan, but they hope to have formulated such a plan by the first week in December so that they will have time to discuss it with several other committees and iron out any difficulties before it is presented to the faculty.

The plan which the IFC committee is working on is designed to give all freshmen in the class of 1971 who desire to be in a fraternity the opportunity to be affiliated with one for at least a year. The report of the Social Life Evaluation Committee states that such a plan must be presented to the faculty by March 1, 1967. If the faculty adopts a plan for total opportunity social affiliation, it will be the first of its kind in the country.

The committee is composed of Tom Covington, Fraternity Liaison Officer; Jim Terry, Assistant Dean of Students; the officers of IFC; five fraternity presidents; and an independent representative. This answer is merely one more answer to the larger fraternity question which has received various answers in the past few years. In early 1960, the fraternities first underwent severe criticism. This year ushers in another change, by which the freshmen undergo formal rush and pledging at the beginning of the second semester.

In other business, delegates to the 1966 National Interfraternity Conference Nov. 30-Dec. 3 in New Orleans were named: Mike Booe, Stan Brown, John Jeter, Gus Cochran, and Ben Cannon. Details of the fraternity Christmas parties for orphans on Dec. 15 were given to the representatives. Tommy Cox announced that the IFC and the Union would jointly sponsor a campus bridge tournament Nov. 29. Johnny Jeter presented a rotation system whereby Richardson Scholars will eat three meals a week at different fraternity houses for a period of six weeks, beginning Nov. 15.

Dedication Set For Next Friday

The J. Spencer Love Auditorium in Chambers Building will be dedicated Friday, Nov. 18 at 8:15 p.m. in a program featuring the Wind Ensemble and the Male Chorus. The dedication will be attended by Mrs. Love, the Board of Visitors, the Executive Committee of the Trustees. All faculty, students, and friends of the college are encouraged to come and may pick up complimentary tickets at the College Union desk. The program will feature the Wind Ensemble playing: Handel’s “Music for the Royal Fireworks,” scenes from “She Stoops to Conquer,” and several selections by the Male Chorus. A reception will be held immediately following the dedication in the Chambers Banquet Hall.

Parents To Visit Tomorrow

Parents of Davidson freshmen come to campus tomorrow to find out how the fine young men they sent off two months ago are holding up under the experience of living on their own. The Freshman Council has planned a host of activities for them with the idea that the college will project to the parents the daily life and environment of their son at Davidson. The activities begin with parental registration in the College Union throughout the morning. From 9:30 to 11:45 a.m. guided tours of the campus will be provided by members of the Freshman Council. Also available will be visits to the freshman dorms and visits to various classes allowing for parents’ attendance. The afternoon activities begin with a buffet luncheon after which will come an assembly program for parents and sons in Love Auditorium. At 3 p.m. the formal agenda ends with a faculty reception allowing parents to get acquainted with their son’s professors.

Winter, a junior English major from Warrenton, Va., said, “We want to really establish The Miscellany, not only here, but also, hopefully, among other schools in the South. We feel the resignation and the change in policy are for continuity. Buddy and I will continue to work with Charlie.” He added that while there will be new things, “these changes have been in our minds for a good while.”

LEARN ROPES

Newsom, also a junior and a psychology major from Corpus Christi, Tex., said, “I personally see a lot of value in Ted and I getting the position this early in the year, because we'll have Charlie Vick around to help us learn the ropes.” He added that “there probably won't be much change in format. We would like to work more closely with contributors to help them and encourage future contributions.”

The changes in The Miscellany started with the Student Council meeting Monday before last. This past Monday, the Publications Board voted to remove The Miscellany’s editor and business manager from the board. Board Chairman Louis Lesesne said, “The feeling of the board was that since it had no control over the selection of the editor, it would make any sort of financial control awkward.” Members of the board, which supervises the finances of the student publications and nominates candidates for their editorship, are the editors and business managers of THE DAVIDSONIAN, Quips and Cranks, and Wildcat Handbook, the college treasurer, and one faculty member.

Under the new arrangements, The Miscellany will be under the control of its Board of Advisors, both editorially and financially. The editor will be selected each year by the board. The Student Council changed its By-laws concerning the election of the editor of The Miscellany because of the urging of Vick. He stated last week, “An editor appointed on the basis of editorial talent and dedication would be superior to a popularly elected editor.”
