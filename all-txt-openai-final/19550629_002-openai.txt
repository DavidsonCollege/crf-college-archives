SOUTHERN SCANDAL

First of all, we want to wish "Happy Birthday" to CARROLL JENKINS and BILL HORNE who celebrated their 22nd and
21st birthdays respectively and respectfully this past week.

BOBBY JOE KEY is taking the fatal step this Friday. We will want you to clue us in on how
you like the "Ball & Chain" life, Bobby.

Reports are coming in that Singing SAMMY PETERS is going on a diet. Don't get too weak to play that
piano, boy!

BO ABERNETHY is still trying to sell his car. Please - Please - somebody take that thing off his hands.
The highest bidder so far has offered $5.00. Can you top that?

Tragedy - We lost one of our co-eds this week. We all hated to see BECKY DEAL leave us after
the first semester. Some felt that she might have converted STUART COLLINS, given three more weeks, for she broke him
of the habit of using certain Biblical names out of context.

COACH DOLE wants JOHN "Squeaky" SIMPSON to play football this fall, but it seems other ideas are had by John
who was on the Georgia All-State football team.

PETE RAKM, BUIYE SEAWELL, and NED HEDGPETH played husband and wife with their girls last weekend. Their families were out-of-town,
and these and their respective lady friends had a very pleasant time.

If anyone wants to hear an interesting story, just ask DON MASSEY how he got his middle name.

ED "SHONEY" wandered around all day Tuesday hunting for a 3rd and 4th for bridge. We recommend a little honeymoon
bridge for you and LYNN, Ed.

SAM McGILL, Y Secretary, brings us news from the Blue Ridge Assembly that CREIGHTON PADEN was elected Chairman of the
Southern Area Student Council of the YMCA.

FRANK RENFROW is having such an easy time with Trig this summer that he is taking a course in night
school called Movies II (that's his goal for the summer session).

Congratulations to PETE PETERSEN, BUDD MONTGOMERY, BOBBY JOE KEY, STRATTON STURGHOS, and BOB SLOOP who all received their sheepskins at
the end of the first semester. We will miss you all!

LACY KEESLER and his brother played some fine tennis in the Charlotte Country Club Invitational Couples Tournament, but they found
some tough competition in the finals when another Keesler brother and his partner edged them out for the championship.

BOB SHIVE can't seem to find those "things" (cells), and Embryology PROFESSOR PUCKETT is losing hair fast.

We want to welcome all those people who have joined the Davidson S. S. Family for the second semester, and
we suggest that you heed our motto:

LIVE IT UP AND MAKE SOUTHERN SCANDAL.
