PRIMA seeks submissions

Online Journal gives spotlight to international studies

Looking for places other than your parents’ refrigerator to display that last “A” paper? Here’s an idea. During the 2000-2001 school year, the Dean Rusk Program began PRIMA, Davidson’s first online journal. PRIMA, or Perspectives on International and Multicultural Affairs, is currently accepting submissions from all interested members of the Davidson community.

Brainchild of Jay Scanlan ’00 and Derek Politzer ’01, PRIMA is an online journal created to showcase the ideas of Davidson students, faculty, and alumni on topics of international and multicultural concern.

According to its mission statement, PRIMA seeks to “promote intellectual exchange” and “increase international awareness and understanding on campus and in the global community.”

The editors-in-chief for the pilot year were Politzer and Katie Wilson ’04. As Wilson is currently in Morocco for the semester, Alyssa Chang ’02 has assumed responsibilities as Editor-in-Chief on campus.

In explaining the journal, Chang said, “PRIMA is designed to provoke and facilitate thought and discussion among the students of Davidson College regarding events with an international dimension.”

Chang commented that the number of submissions is up from last year; as to who is submitting articles, she said, “We’ve received submissions from students, faculty, and alumni of Davidson College, but the majority [of those] submissions are sent in by [current] students.”

Evans McGowan ’05, PRIMA’s Submissions Editor, said that, “Many of the articles are about personal passions or experiences by Davidson students, which tends to make for an interesting read.”

Chang is pleased with the steady growth the publication is experiencing this year. “Happily I’ve had the privilege of working with a group of dedicated and intelligent individuals,” she said. “The second issue of PRIMA is going to be great!”

“I could see this venture substantially growing in the coming years,” offered McGowan.

To submit your own paper or article for consideration in PRIMA, visit the journal’s website, www.davidson.edu/administrative/dean_rusk/dean_rusk/PRIMA.htm or email Alyssa Chang (alchang@davidson.edu) or Evans McGowan (evmcgowan@davidson.edu).
