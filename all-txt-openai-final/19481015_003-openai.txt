“Southern” Fair Attracts Students

Last week many Davidson students took time off from their studies and soon found themselves outside of the main entrance of the Southern States Fair in Charlotte, tightly clutching their small green passes in their hands. Upon gaining admittance, most of them passed up the Agricultural building in favor of the bright lights of the Midway which stretched beyond. The quest for knowledge, which is inborn in all the sons of the Hill, was prevalent in their minds; and the intriguing secrets that lay ahead, hidden in the Midway, must be discovered.

Momentarily free of the solitude of the library and the austerity of the classrooms, some of the students sought recklessness and daring on the various amusement rides, while the more studious endeavored to further their knowledge in the field of human anatomy. Of course, there were also the freshmen who themselves were fascinated with the Pin-Headed Man and the Monkey Exhibitions, which were two of the numerous sideshows that surrounded the Midway.

While their more studious mates sat home in Davidson surrounded by tall stacks of books, these neophytes of higher education were actually crowded closely together in the first six rows of Georgia Southern’s smoke-filled fair. (All other seats were bearing the weight of upperclassmen.) The nervous looks of anticipation soon gave way to broad smiles of satisfaction when the four-piece band blurted out with Beethoven’s Fifth—for they knew full well that the show was on!

As the band continued playing, one hundred and eighteen pounds of gorgeous femininity, thrown together in a wonderful way and tied by two pieces of small satin, danced onto the stage and proceeded to entertain our now wide-eyed freshmen by throwing things around. (We don’t quite understand that last phrase, but that’s the way it was told to us.)

Six cigarettes later, Georgia herself came lightly tripping across the stage with her bulging personality. A hush descended on the gathering as everyone sat back to see what was coming off. Though abounding with beauty and grace, Georgia’s main attraction consisted of the clothes she didn’t wear. Her primary purpose, we believe, in the field of entertainment was to portray to the masculine world the new Fall Fashions. In no time at all, the aptness of the term “Fall” Fashions was made perfectly clear. Overlooking her facial features, Georgia was not a bad-looking girl.

In the interest of our paper, we felt it our duty to have a personal interview with this charming creature. After waiting in line for an hour with other students who felt the same duty, we were finally admitted into her dressing room (still unable to figure out why it was called such). We told her why we were there; and she said she would be glad to tell us her story, so that we could in turn relate it to those “cute little boys with the darling red caps.” She said that she was born in “Southern Georgia,” and that she was really a beautiful baby. Her mother proudly pointed out her beautiful baby-blue eyes and her then blonde curly hair to all the neighbors. She said when she grew up, “she just picked up where her mother had left off (or she left off what her mother had picked up).”

Many a heart was saddened when the Fair closed up Saturday night because the students knew when that happened they couldn’t see any more of Georgia. We think we are safe in saying that many of the sons of Stewart Ney will forever be indebted to Georgia for pointing out to them some of the fairer things of life.

BIRTH ANNOUNCEMENT

On Friday morning at four o’clock at the Presbyterian Hospital in Charlotte, a nine and one-half pound baby girl was born to Mr. and Mrs. BillSmith. Mrs. Smith and the baby are doing fine.
