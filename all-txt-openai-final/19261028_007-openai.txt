THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER 28, 1926

ROWAN COUNTY ALUMNI ORGANIZED LAST TUESDAY

Was Third Association Formed in the Past Month—Large Crowd Present for the Meeting

Forty-two Davidson men were present at the hut of the First Presbyterian Church last Tuesday night at 6:30 in Salisbury, where they met to permanently organize the Rowan County Alumni Association of Davidson College, at which Mr. Barry Taylor, of Salisbury, was elected president; Mr. I. P. Graham, of Cooleemee, was chosen as vice-president, and Mr. Reid Sloan was selected as secretary-treasurer. A unique feature of the gathering was the presence of eight boys, who are Davidson students here now, and who had been invited by those in charge to return. In addition, two alumni were present from Cooleemee and four from Mocksville, upon invitation of the Salisbury people. Mr. F. L. Jackson, Dr. T. W. Lingle, and Mr. Ernest Milton were other Davidson representatives present. “O Davidson” and “College Ties” were sung during the course of the evening’s program, which was something that has not been tried at other organization meetings. Talks were given by Mr. Barry Taylor, of Salisbury; Mr. F. L. Jackson; Mr. I. P. Graham, Mr. J. Hurley, Dr. Sommerville, Dr. T. W. Lingle, a native of Rowan County, of the class of 1876, and Mr. Ernest Milton. Salisbury alumni were enthusiastic over this step, and in the several talks heard from the men of that city, they pledged allegiance to the alumni work. While no definite date was set for another meeting, the executive committee has it in its power to call them together, and it is believed that it will be made a semi-annual affair.

Rev. Chas. Kenbridge has moved from Amherst, Va., to Montgomery, 232.

TICKETS, PLEASE!

Tickets for reserved seats at the Carolina game are now on sale for the alumni. These may be obtained by writing W. M. McGill, Treasurer of the Davidson College Athletic Association. The price is two dollars, and a ticket will be mailed to any alumni upon receipt of that amount. These seats will be reserved on the sides of the fields. Tickets for seats at the end of the field will not be on sale till the day of the game, when the price will be a dollar and a half. A great number of alumni have already been notified that these reserved seats are on sale. All who intend to attend the game will be repaid by securing a reserved seat, because they will stand a poor chance of getting a good seat if they wait till the day of the game, when there will be no reserved seats on sale.

DAVIDSON FIVE YEARS AGO

The Wildcats overcame the Spiders of Richmond University in a hard-fought game on Virginia soil. The Spiders had the Wildcats tangled in a closely-meshed web, from which they were unable to emerge until the last of the third quarter. But Spratt Moore, unwilling to leave the field until he had drawn blood, rushed across the goal line and tallied the only score of the game. The Wildcats, in overcoming the Richmond eleven, upset the dope of sport writers in both states. The Cats returned to the Hill in the highest of spirits, expecting to down the strong Citadel team the following weekend.

Hugh Grey, member of the Wildcat eleven for three consecutive years, president of the Athletic Association, and popular student on the campus, returns to guide the Cats in their practice. He successfully piloted the Red and Black Machine against the Richmond “Spiders” and with that same grim determination is looking forward to winning the state pennant this year.

Governor Coolidge, Republican candidate for Vice-President, accompanied by Governor Lowden, of Illinois, on his special train, en route to Charlotte, stopped at Davidson and spoke to the faculty and students who had gathered to see him pass through. Governor Coolidge did not mention...

He stated that the assertion that a man’s happiest days were spent in college was not true; but that they came when a man was tackling the problems of and overcoming real life. He advised the students to prepare themselves for the problems that would come up in later life.
