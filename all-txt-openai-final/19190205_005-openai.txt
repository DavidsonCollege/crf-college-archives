Rural Sunday Schools Are Being Reorganized

Good Crowds Out for First Services of Spring Term.

Last Sunday twenty-two Davidson men went out into the country on Sunday School work. This was the first time that the influenza situation has permitted the schools to be conducted, but with a continuation of the recent excellent weather there should be no relapse in the situation. Despite the fact that this was the first Sunday at most of the schools, the total attendance was two hundred and nineteen—which was very encouraging. At each place the people seemed glad to have college men back to lead them. Indeed, statistics on attendance prove that Davidson men always bring an increase in attendance. This appreciation on the part of the people fully repays the men for the inconveniences caused them by giving their afternoon to the work.

While the corps of teachers is full and overflowing at present, later when the schools get into their running stride there will be need of more men. If you are interested, tell E.G. Lilly or Emery Flinn.

The DAVIDSONIAN, February 5, 1919

The World Problems Discussed In Forum

Beginning Thursday Night World Mission Problems will be Studied.

The Davidson branch of the World Forum for Mission Study is now being organized in every college of the...land, will hold its first session Thursday evening at 6:45. For the present, it will meet in the large room down at the "Y". If the game room proves to be too small, Shearer chapel will be well heated to make a comfortable meeting place. A dandy little book, "The Call of a World Task," by Lovell Murray, will form the basis of these studies. Each member will have a copy and is expected to take some part in the meeting, if only by asking questions. Bob Miles will be in charge and will appoint someone to help him study up any questions that cannot be answered in the class. In addition to these studies, several of the fellows may have special studies to discuss from time to time, such as "The Effect of a League of Nations on Missions in all parts of the World." There will be at least twelve of these interesting studies. Every fellow who possibly can is urged to take advantage of this opportunity to learn of world conditions and world needs resulting from the war.
