'Rector of St. Mary’s School, will speak at the Y.M.C.A. Secures Future Speakers for Services

On December 12th, Dr. C. E. Raynal, pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Statesville, N. C., will speak. Dr.
Raynal is not an old Davidson man, but he is an excellent speaker and he will be very interesting to
all those who attend. These next two speakers should command a better attendance than has been had in the past
few weeks, and a large attendance is expected. Special music will be rendered at both services.

On December 5th, Rev. Warren W. Way, rector of St. Mary’s School, will speak at the “Y” vesper service. At
Raleigh, N. C., Mr. Way is an influential man in the Episcopal Church and has a special appeal to college
students. He is a young man and will be very interesting to all those who attend.

The last service before the Christmas holidays begin will be the feature of the meetings held this fall. On this
night, December 19th, a student musical program will be rendered and a large attendance is expected. Last year 515 students
attended this meeting. The Glee Club and Quartet will play an important part at this meeting and will render a
group of Christmas carols. The Christmas spirit will prevail throughout the whole meeting. The program for this meeting has not
been definitely arranged as yet but it is thought that there will be at least one student speaker.

A FLAVOR YOU CAN'T FORGET

A Scotchman was found dead in front of a one-cent slot machine. Examination showed that his death was the result
of overexertion. Then the mystery was solved, for there was a sign reading, “Your penny returned if you hit hard
enough.”

“Y” Column

Dr. Way will be the speaker on Sunday. This famous rector of St. Mary’s School will bring a message that
deserves the attention of every man in the student body of Davidson College. Let's give him a good crowd. Remember
the date—December 5th.

A deputation will go to Queens College on Sunday. Only two men will go, Alan Frew and Ronald Wilson, and
they will have charge of the “Y” service there. Another deputation will go to the Second Presbyterian Church of Salisbury.

The “Y” expresses its gratification over the pleasant time enjoyed at the little reception given by Mrs. Martin on Thanksgiving
afternoon. A good number were present and all had a wonderful time.'experienced a very enjoyable time. Another one of these
receptions will be held soon for the Freshmen, to help the “Y” get in closer touch with the men of
the class.

Next week the “Y” will have its annual Hangchow Fund Campaign, from which funds go to support Warren Cox, of
the class of 1924, who is teaching chemistry in China. He is working to instill Davidson principles and ideals in
men across the sea. A magnificent work and one that deserves your aid.

The “Y” is holding services on Sunday afternoons once a month at Shearer Chapel and Hobson Church.

To those who are not familiar with the facts about the life of Warren Cox, '24, teaching in China, the
following items concerning his life while on the campus of D.C. might be of interest. Warren was one of the
outstanding men of his class—an honor man, wearer of the “D,” Phi Beta Kappa and many other student activities and
honors. He was also a member of the Kappa Alpha social fraternity. All in all, he stood for the ideals
and aims for which Davidson is known and was a typical Wildcat.

Steps have already been taken to secure a speaker for the spring service—the “Y” hopes to get one of the
most noted ministers in the country for these meetings.

On December 19th, the last Sunday before Christmas, the vesper service will be the annual student musical program. A special
program will be gotten up, as in former years, and Christmas music will be used by the Glee Club and
the Quartet, together with the whole student body.

The “Y” plans to take up a collection of old clothes next week, the proceeds from the sale of which
will go to the support of the Mission at Crossnore. This admirable work is under the charge of Mary Martin
Sloop, sister of President Martin, of Davidson College, and she has been extraordinarily successful in building up a great mountain
work in this mission. She was the subject of a feature article in the American Magazine recently, as a tribute
to the wonderful work she is doing.
