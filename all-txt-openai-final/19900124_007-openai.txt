‘Cats unlucky in hoops; Gaines quits

By JOHN BURNS

UNC-W 74—Davidson 58

The Wildcats traveled to Wilmington Thursday to battle the Seahawks of the Colonial Athletic Conference. They made the trip without second leading scorer Magic Gaines, who left the team for unknown reasons. Gaines could not be reached for comment.

The Wildcats, even with the return of Mo Gray, who scored nine points, could not hold off the Seahawks. UNC-W walked away with a 16-point win.

Winthrop 51—Davidson 49

The Wildcats played better Saturday night and took the 13-3 Eagles down to the wire in Belk Arena. Both teams shot around 38 percent, but the Eagles won the game with excellent 21 for 30 foul shooting. In comparison, Davidson went to the line only 11 times.

The Eagles were without leading scorer Shawn Wise, but recovered to pull out the victory after the Wildcats wasted 27 seconds before fouling a Winthrop player. After a missed one-and-one, Darry Strickland intentionally fouled George Henson, who hit his second shot. Mo Gray’s desperation shot missed at the buzzer.

Paul Denmond scored 17 points and extended his streak of double-figure games to 17. No other Wildcat made over eight points.

Appalachian State 88—Davidson 60

The Cats hiked up to Boone to face the Mountaineers on Monday night in Alumni Gym. Davidson outplayed ASU in the first half, largely behind the effort of Jay Schmitt, who scored 16 in the game. However, a murderous run by the Mountaineers in the second half did in the Wildcats as the losing streak continued at 12.

The Cats out-rebounded App State 51-36 and once went on a 15-2 run to pull away near the end of the half. With 17:21 remaining in the game, the score was 37-34 Davidson. A little over 11 minutes later, it was 64-39, ASU.

This game showed Magic Gaines' absence, as Coach Bob McKillop pointed to a “lack of leadership” in the second half. Denmond was held to seven points on 2 of 11 shooting.

The Wildcats did benefit from the return of 6’7" Paul Drobnitch, who scored two points on an open court dunk.

Next shots
The Cats travel to South Carolina to play the Gamecocks on Thursday and host Wofford on Saturday at 7:30 p.m. in a televised game. The SGA is trying to organize a bus trip to Furman on February 8. Get in touch with them for more information.

Baseball fans get ready...the season is here
Baseball looks for 30 wins in 1990

By GIGGY MAXWELL

The 1990 version of the Wildcat baseball team opens its season in a little over two weeks with a home double-header against UNC-Asheville. It’s a good bet that it will improve over last year's 12-27 record.

Last year’s season began with 15 of the Wildcat’s first 16 dates being rained out. The team never really got out of the starting gate after that.

With this group of Cats a year older, an equally challenging schedule should see them return to the 20+ win level, with an outside shot at 30.

Here’s how the starters break down:

Calling the signals behind the plate will be 5’9", 175-pound Mac Chapman, a freshman out of Gaithersburg, MD. Mac’s strong showing in the fall season has Coach Jim Stoeckel convinced he can handle the pitching staff, even though he is a freshman.

Joe Azzolino returns to play first base and put his .325 average, 4 HRs, and 17 RBIs back into the lineup. His four home runs led the club last year. With only one error last season, he looks ready to anchor the right side of the infield.

Returning to his natural position at second base is Mikio Aoki (.296, 3 HRs, 25 RBIs). Aoki filled the catching spot last year. He made the transition well and led the team in RBIs.

The player to watch this season is shortstop Robert Eenhoorn. Eenhoorn is a freshman from Rotterdam, Netherlands, and was a member of the Dutch National team. He has already been named a pre-season All-American and is a legitimate pro prospect. The middle-aged men that you see drooling in the stands will be Major League scouts. Catch him while you can.

At third base will be sophomore Mike Liebdzinski (.261, 0, 18). Lebo led the Wildcats in 1989 with 111 assists and 17 double plays.

Peter Hughes (.383, 0, 5) will roam right field and hopefully stay healthy for the entire season. Last year a hand injury forced Hughes to miss 24 of the 39 games. Despite the power-limiting injury, he led the team with a .383 batting average.

Resident speedster Ron Krnacik (.295, 2, 19) returns to play center field and steal bases. He had 16 thefts and 33 runs scored.

Left field is rather crowded at this stage with Ralph Isernia (.207, 0, 6), Lin Williams (.226, 0, 3), and Dan Cotton (.256, 0, 4) vying for the position. All will likely see playing time in left field and should share the DH spot.

Pitching was last year’s sore thumb as opposing batters tattooed the Wildcat staff. Opposing teams had a .301 average and scored just over six runs per game.

Greg Wilcox anchors the starting staff. His 3.77 ERA, five wins, and 88 1/3 innings pitched led the Wildcats last year. Wilcox is looking for double figures in the win column this season.
