### Indications Point to Strenuous Game With Clemson On Friday

**Coach Crayton Working His Men Hard for This All-Important Struggle**

With two scalps hanging from its belt, the Wildcat clan is putting on fresh war paint in view of the Clemson game Friday. There are more reasons than one why the Red and Black machine is out for blood in this game. Foremost in the minds of the old men is the sad recollection of the outcome of the struggle last year when Clemson emerged from the Thanksgiving game the winner by a 7 to 0 score. This was the only instance during the abbreviated season where Davidson was scored on.

Going into the game Friday with the record of not having been scored on this season as yet, and with one of the best teams the Red and Black has had in years, Davidson will undoubtedly put up a better game of football than in either of the previous games. Clemson will be one of the most formidable foes that Davidson will play this year. The Tigers swamped Erskine Saturday by the score of 52 to 0. This speaks remarkably well of the offensive strength of the Tiger machine, but hitting a line like Davidson and Erskine are two entirely different matters.

The whole Clemson backfield of last year is back, including Banks, captain and quarter; Allison and Harris, fullbacks, and Armstrong and Odell, halfbacks. The whole team is composed of letter men, eighteen having returned this year. A strange coincidence concerning the game next Friday is that Hammett, who helped score a victory over Davidson last year, will be in the game again, but fighting in an opposite direction. Hammett has proven a tower of strength at left tackle this year and envious eyes will be cast upon him by Clemson followers when he begins the contest against his old teammates next Friday.

The Davidson line will probably be the same as it has been during the last two games: Miley and Douglas, ends; Hammett and McMaster, tackles; LaFar and Romefelt, guards; Brady, center. The personnel of the backfield will probably undergo a slight change. The return of Johnny Johnston, last year’s crack halfback, will necessitate a shake-up somewhere. “Johnny” was Davidson’s most consistent ground gainer last year and he seems to be in the same rare condition this year. Black will undoubtedly continue at left half and Spann at quarter, Johnston will probably play right half, while Shepherd will be at full. At any event, the strength of the backfield next Friday will be much better than it has yet been this season, as every regular will be in the game in mid-season trim.

### A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY!—A GIRL AND A TICKET AT ONE SHOT.

One day last week the student body was favored with a talk by Mrs. A. A. McGeachy, of Charlotte. Mrs. McGeachy has the unique distinction of being the first woman to appear before the Davidson student body at chapel. She came to tell the students of the approaching musicales in Charlotte which are to be given under the auspices of the Queens College Alumni Association. During the first part of October, Charlotte will hear one of the most famous of artists, Galli-Curci.

A very attractive proposition was made to the students by Mrs. McGeachy. The first ten students to purchase tickets for the four performances are to be made co-ushers at the musicale with the ten prettiest girls at Queens College. Could any proposition be made that would prove more attractive than this?

### Attractive Lyceum Course Planned

**Two Numbers in Fall and Three in Spring—Final Dates Not Definitely Settled**

Acting in accordance with the vote of support which was given in chapel, arrangements have been made with the Redpath Chautauqua Company for a lyceum course to be given this year. Final dates have not as yet been sent to the managers but two of the numbers will be presented this fall, and three next spring. The Redpath people are sending their best entertainers, the first of whom to appear being the Rich-Werno Company, two young ladies who present comedy sketches, songs, and readings. They will be here within the next two weeks and announcement of the date will be made as soon as definitely known.

The other four companies include the Coleens, four girls who give the most entertaining songs and readings; Opie Reed, the well-known humorist; Pachard, the cartoonist—his cartoons are life-size—and Laurant, a magician who brings several assistants with him. Until the past summer, Laurant has appeared on the Keith vaudeville circuit. Season tickets are to be placed on sale this week. The price for the five numbers is $1.75 plus 10 percent war tax. If good support is given this course it has been promised that thereafter we can get whatever we desire for programs.

### Blue Pencil Club Meets for First Time

**To Reward Best Worker for Magazine With Medal**

The Blue Pencil Club held its first meeting of the year last Wednesday night. This meeting was merely for organization for the year and many plans were discussed. Among others, the Sigma Upsilon decided to give a medal for work on the Davidson College Magazine. This medal is not given for purely literary work, but to the one whose literary efforts are good and who proves the greatest aid to the magazine. With the Sigma Upsilon behind the magazine, this year should be the best in the history of that publication.

### Money for Band Being Raised by Student Cotton Pickers

**Freshmen First to Go—Work Nets a Hundred Dollars—Sunburns and Stiffness Attest Strenuous Day**

The Fresh class picked cotton on last Friday. Truly it was a day unlike all others in the history of Davidson College. Eight fields of Dixie’s greatest produce greeted the rising sun resplendent in whiteness and clothed in nature's own luxurious garments. When that self-same sun hid its molten mass behind the mountain, the nocturnal breezes of the early autumn rustled the frames of the plants which stood bare and shivering in their nakedness. The Fresh had picked cotton.

The ways and means committee of the student body, appointed to find a way to raise money for the band, decided to send the Freshmen to pick cotton. The work netted a hundred dollars, and the sunburns and stiffness of the students attest to the strenuous day they had.1919 Wildcat football invasion, when Wake Forest's colors were lowered to the tune of 21 to 0. Steamroller tactics in hitting the line enabled the Davidson backfield to score three touchdowns against their heavier adversaries. These scores came in the second, third, and fourth quarters, respectively. Handicapped by the lengthy kick-off which rolled behind her own goal line, Davidson was unable to advance the ball beyond midfield. Black scored all of Davidson's touchdowns by his famous broken field running and line plunging. It was just a case of too strong a line for Wake Forest, and after the first quarter, the Baptists didn’t have a chance. Although outweighed by their opponents, the Red and Black line continually opened up holes which enabled the backfield to gain consistently. Also, their breaking through and blocking the punts and drop kicks of Rabenhoist had a large and distinct bearing on the Davidson victory. Twice in the first quarter, the Wake Forest stellar fullback attempted field goals without success. The game was marred by many fumbles on both sides near the close. With the exception of this fault, the game was fast and both sides were full of the old gridiron slogan—“fight.” Captain Rabenhoist, Blackshear, Jennette, the crafty Baptist quarter, and Olive featured for Wake Forest, while “Jack” Black and “Henry” Spann's work were the outstanding assets of the Wildcat offensive.

The attendance included scores of visitors from Raleigh and other nearby towns. Governor Bickett, alumnus of Wake Forest, and State Treasurer B. R. Lacy, who has two sons at Davidson, were among the enthusiastic spectators.

First Quarter.
Heckman, kicking off for Wake Forest, kicked behind the Davidson goal line. Black and Cassell by end runs succeeded in bringing the ball to the 40-yard line, only to lose it on a fumble. By straight football, the Baptists, going better than at any latter stage of the game, advanced the ball to the 15-yard line. The Red and Black line stiffened and Rabenhoist attempted a field goal. It was blocked, a Wake Forest player recovering the ball. Being held for downs, the ball went over and Davidson carried the ball to midfield. The quarter ended with the ball in Davidson’s possession on the 40-yard line. Score: Davidson 0; Wake Forest 0.

Second Quarter.
Opening up the quarter with a rush, the Wildcats, enabled by the great work of the line, advanced to the five-yard line. The punch was lacking, however, and Wake Forest held them for downs, the ball going over. Unable to gain, Wake Forest made an unsuccessful attempt to punt and Davidson recovered the ball on the 15-yard line. In the last three minutes of play, Black carried the ball over for the first touchdown. Goal was kicked. The half ended with the ball in Wake Forest's possession in midfield. Score: Davidson 7; Wake Forest 0.

Third Quarter.
Wake Forest received the kick-off on their five-yard line. Failure to advance forced them to punt. Davidson fumbled on the 35-yard line and lost the ball. Wake Forest in turn fumbled, but recovered the ball only to lose it on another misplay. Here Davidson began a spurt of line bucks which carried the ball within the shadows of the goal posts. Black carried the ball over for the second touchdown. Goal was kicked. The quarter ended before play was resumed. Score: Davidson 14; Wake Forest 0.

Fourth Quarter.
On the kick-off Wake Forest returned the ball to the 35-yard line, but was held for downs and forced to kick. Davidson failed to gain and the ball went over. Wake Forest attempted a forward pass which was intercepted by Davidson. Again the Wildcat line opened up breaches in the Baptist line and Spann called first on one and then on another of his backs to shoot through. Rushing down the field without losing possession of the ball, Black finally shoved the ball over for the final touchdown in the last minute of play. Goal was kicked. The whistle blew before the ball could be put in play and the game ended: Davidson 21; Wake Forest 0.

DON'T BE A COTTON PICKING “SLACKER”
A method for raising money for financing a band suggested that the students secure the desired funds by picking cotton. They did—pick cotton. The Fresh were selected to begin the procedure. An early breakfast was provided for them on the 26th as there was formation a few minutes later. At the command “fall in" 172 representatives of the class of '23 arranged themselves in a crescent with one horn on Dormitory Row. The roll was called and absent members rounded up. The fortunate ones were then divided into squads of from 9 to 30 Fresh each, and marched to Shearer Hall, where transportation awaited them in the form of ten wagons and eight cars. There the parade began. The leading wagon initiated the sport by having one of its seats (boards) fall followed by those who sat thereon. One lot went to the north but the remaining seven batches of Fresh were hauled or motored, as the case was, to the south of town and the majority of them came to rest, or rather to work, in the neighborhood of Bethel church.

Lunch hour was observed, and very scrupulously, from 12:30 till 1:30. Dinners had been provided by local boarding houses for the toilers and the pickers had no trouble in providing for the dinners. Due to the thoughtfulness of Mr. Long, Mr. Elliott, Knox and Barnette, Smiley, the Davidson Kandy Kitchen, Col. Mueller and Mr. Hampton, iced drinks were served to the men in the afternoon. “Starving men grasping for food” is a favorite figure of fiction but it was absolutely left behind by the way the boys grabbed those dopes which were offered them. Appreciated is the word. Mayor Sloan contributed five dollars to the cause to “Help with your hand,” as he expressed it. A reporter from the Davidsonian and the staff photographer visited seven of the scenes of action in the afternoon. Everywhere the spirit was the same. Not that there were no time-killers in evidence but they were very much in the minority. Every party wanted to know what the other had done and to congratulate or console themselves as the reply required.

At Gamble's, the first point visited, the boys were working in the shadow of the mountain (15 miles away). No argument was necessary to persuade them to quit work and indulge. At Bumgarner’s a ten-acre field was in the process of being de-cottoned. Ten men on one farm said that they were on their way to unload a wagon which upon examination was found to be almost empty. On still another farm half the men were picking cotton and the remainder seemed to be holding down the cotton pile.

At the last place visited the work—
