LIFE IN '90

HELL IS BEING TRAPPED IN AN OVERCROWDED CLASSROOM FULL OF RESENTFUL, NEGLECTED KIDS.

SO HOW'S SCHOOL GOING THIS YEAR?

WE'RE TAUGHT BY AN EXHAUSTED, UNDERPAID TEACHER ON THE VERGE OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN.

OUR TEXTBOOKS READ LIKE THEY'VE BEEN EDITED BY SOME SORT OF MONSTROUS DEEDLAVORIAWG MACHINE.

CERTAIN IDEAS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO BE TAUGHT, CERTAIN BOOKS ARE BANNED FROM THE LIBRARY, AND CERTAIN T-SHIRTS ARE FORBIDDEN.

WE'RE TAUGHT FACTS THAT AREN'T TRUE, HISTORY THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN, AND RULES THAT NO ONE OBEYS.

THE ADMINISTRATORS HATE THE TEACHERS, THE TEACHERS HATE THEIR PAY, THE KIDS HATE EVERYTHING, AND OUR DAYS ARE FILLED WITH UNCHALLENGING TESTS, POINTLESS BUSY-WORK, AND MINDLESS MEMORIZATION.

SO THINGS ARE IMPROVING, EH?

WHAT IS SAID: FACTS ON PAPER. WHAT IS MEANT: DESPAIR.
