The DAVIDSONIAN. February 27, 1918

Alumni Notes

DAVIDSON SERVICE FLAG.

The following are extracts from a letter from W. C. Smith, ex-’20, now in the Marines, stationed at Paris Island,
S. C. His complete address is 79th Company, Marine Barracks, Paris Island, S. C.

“I enlisted and began my training with the 69th Company, and drilled side by side with F. M. Thompson (ex-'20)
until I took measles and lost a couple of weeks and was transferred to the 79th Company. Wasn't there many
days before “Scrub” Hollandsworth (ex-’19) was also transferred to the same company, so I have had the luck of being
with one of the D. C. boys most of the time. Thompson and McBryde are now ready to ‘shove off’
and I would have been ready but for losing a couple of weeks with measles. Spratt (ex-'20) left here about
January 1 for Quantico, Va., and R. W. Robinson left a couple of weeks ago. He is doing guard duty
in a small Massachusetts town, twenty-five miles south of Boston. I don’t know where Patterson and the two Cranfords are,
but I think Patterson and Reid Cranford are here yet, ready to leave any time.

“A fellow never knows what he is going to do and where he is going to be sent. Some of
the Marines do guard duty on the large battleships and in the large cities and in munition plants. Others go
to Quantico and get further training for duty abroad. Some are sent to radio and clerical schools, some are detailed
here for laborers, island patrols, ‘prisoner chasers,’ etc. So no one knows what to expect, but must be prepared for
anything.

“All the D. C. boys here have finished their instruction on the rifle range and not one of them has
failed to qualify as marksman or better. You can see from this that the D. C. boys are on the
job here as they always are wherever you see them.”

The following alumni, now in the service of Uncle Sam, were on the Hill for the week-end: Lieut. J. M.
Black, ex-’18, of Camp Jackson; Lieut. J. C. Paisley, '17, of Camp Greene; and Private J. T. Maddrey, ex-’19, 435th
Depot Detachment, Engineers, Camp Greene.

Rev. R. M. Stinson, '08, who has been at Danville, Va., has been called to be pastor of one of
the churches at Atlanta, Ga., and will take up his work at once.

NEW OFFICERS ARE ELECTED BY GOLF CLUB

A meeting of the Davidson Golf Club was held February 16, at which the following officers were elected: Dr. H.
B. Arbuckle, president; Dr. G. H. Cartledge, treasurer; J. W. Clark, secretary; A. E. Wood, chairman of greens committee. A
resolution was passed that caddies should not receive more than 15 cents for nine holes; this includes carrying clubs. Another
resolution was passed that none should pay over 10 cents for any ball which has been found. As has been
brought out before, the Golf Club is not a college but a town organization, the privileges of which are extended
to the students if they desire to become members.
