These are men who have rendered distinguished service in the interest of old Davidson since their graduation. Three of the

Mr. Moore is at present Principal of the Winston-Salem High School; Mr. Golden is pastor of the First Presbyterian Church
of Sanford, N.C.; Mr. Willcox is the Headmaster of the MacCallie School; and Mr. Miles has charge of the Y.M.C.A.

Delta Kappa organization.
