Jesus Christ Superstar
will be performed at

Davidson

By Setu Davis

With two weeks left to production, Judas was leaping up and down the stage, his cries punctuated by the wild
tossing about of his arms. Once the scene ended, Jesus Christ Superstar director Chase Bringardner smiled, his arms quite silent
and crossed over his chest. Judas (Austin Rios) certainly had a lot of energy. From my vantage point in the
center of Love Auditorium, that energy certainly seemed to be coming together in the whole cast.

My first introduction to the inner-workings of theater came the night I sat in on a rehearsal of the upcoming
performance of Jesus Christ Superstar. I sat down in one of the seats in Love Auditorium and watched as the
cast circled up and proceeded to “zap!” at each other emphatically. Bringardner led the cast through a series of exercises
that, while a little like Rios’s leaping performance, focused the group’s energy. I was entertained by that energy, so, when
they began to rehearse some of the most emotionally charged scenes of the musical, I was quite ready to see
their new production of Jesus Christ Superstar.

By all appearances, opening night of the Davidson student production of this powerful musical should be a charged one. The
musical’s story is based upon the final few days of Jesus Christ’s life. Containing the compositions of Andrew Lloyd Webber,
Jesus Christ Superstar presents a very unique rendition of the Christ tale. In its uniqueness, it goes beyond a simple
retelling of the Gospel, and is, instead, a tale that stands strongly in its own right. Can one go wrong
combining rock and the Bible? Certainly, with Superstar, it seems that the answer is “no.”

Having seen the movie production of the musical, I sat in my seat in Love with a great deal of
anticipation as the cast began to rehearse some of the most powerful scenes. Peter (Justin Perkinson) and Mary (Anna McDonald)
came on stage and performed their ballad beautifully. The two harmonized and, with simple movements and facial gestures, brought me
far from my seat in Love and into the power of the musical.

One of the most emotional and compelling numbers in the whole musical is Judas’ death scene. In the movie version
that I saw, Judas’ fiery challenge to God made goosebumps raise on my arms. I also had goosebumps watching the
rehearsal of the scene in Love. Rios brought that same fire to Judas, and kneeling with his hand raised, contrasted
with the equally moving rendition of Peter and Mary’s ballad by McDonald and Perkinson.

Jesus Christ Superstar has quite a cast assembled for this production. Unfortunately, I cannot name each and every one of
the huge group, but I must say, from seeing some of the dance numbers and mob scenes, no one is
lacking in energy. If everything comes together, as I think it will, then this production simply should not be missed.

The musical will be performed in Love Auditorium on Thursday, April 15th at 8:00 pm, Friday, April 16th at 4:30
pm, Saturday, April 17th at 8:00 pm, and Sunday, April 18th at 2:00 pm.
