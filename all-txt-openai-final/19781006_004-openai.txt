#### Pre-Packaged Davidson

The Board of Trustees’ support for the 1987 Program has been lagging, and one of the purposes of last weekend's special meeting was to encourage Trustees to assume a more active financial and leadership role in the Program. Director of Special Resources Julius Melton seems to have assumed that Trustees are more likely to contribute if they meet up with the “right kind” of Davidson student while on campus. Thus they engineered conversations between Trustees and a select few “ideal” students. Presenting this pre-packaged picture of Davidson is not, we suggest, the way to bring the Board into closer involvement with Davidson or its 1987 program.

Assume for a moment that you are a Trustee. Stealing a weekend from your hectic schedule, you escape the problems, pressures, and challenges of your career to attend a Board meeting. Once at Davidson, the quiet serenity of the shaded lawns surrounds you. The administration, which has been preparing for this meeting for weeks, presents “we've got it all together” reports on all phases of campus life. You chat briefly with an “ideal” student. Your impression: “All is well at Davidson. Might as well leave things alone—the administration is doing a fine job.”

What sort of impression would the Trustees leave with if they talked to more than just the “ideal” student and knew what was really going on at Davidson? What would the Trustees think if they talked to the WDAV student staff, which, after building the station from nothing into something, is concerned that their voice in station policymaking is dwindling to insignificance? And what would the Trustees think if they talked to one of the 300 people who signed a petition advocating a sex-blind, merit-based admissions policy for Davidson? Or if they heard a student voice concern over the uncertain future of the South Asian Studies Program? The Trustees just might think, “Things aren't as quiet as they seemed. There are some problems here that demand solutions, and it is our job to mediate between students, faculty, and administration to solve these problems.”

When the Trustees stop being weekend visitors and start being informed policy shapers for today’s Davidson, then they will assume leadership to build tomorrow's Davidson through the 1987 Program. Melton himself suggested a means by which the Trustees can learn what really happens at Davidson: “Perhaps a lottery system would have been better,” he reckons. For the next Trustee meeting, let’s try it this way. Two weeks before the Trustees are to arrive on campus, the SGA will collect the names of all in the community interested in talking with a Trustee. Toss all those names into a hat, and draw at random to determine who will be granted an opportunity to meet with a Trustee. Arrange the Trustee’s schedule to eliminate those useless “peanut and punch” receptions, and allow each Trustee to spend that half-hour in two fifteen-minute conversations with the chosen students.

#### Reconsider and Reassume

It is most disappointing to see that the faculty wishes to relinquish its privilege to select a representative from its number to sit on...

For the faculty, selecting a member to the Media Board is a bothersome, time-consuming task. It is far easier to hand over the power of appointment to the administration. But taking the easy way out is not in this instance wise. The Media Board is charged with overseeing student media at Davidson, a task which certainly should involve all segments of the community. Therefore, students, administrators, and faculty must be full partners in determining the Board’s membership. 

We ask the faculty to reconsider its position in this matter, and to reassume the responsibility of selecting a representative to the Media Board. Also in regard to the Media Board: The Student Government has selected its two representatives to the Media Board, and the Publications Board this week picked its nominee to the Board. The next move is up to President Spencer, who has promised to name his two choices for the Media Board very soon. We urge Spencer to choose his nominees within the week so the Board can meet, organize, and begin untangling the question, “Is WDAV a student media?”

Letter to the Editor

Meeting will deal with African issues

To the Editor:

To the faculty and students,

As members of the Duke Southern Africa Coalition, we would like to invite you to a conference we're sponsoring at Duke on November 11 and 12, 1978. Called “Universities and Southern Africa,” the conference’s main goal will be to establish a network of campus groups in the Southeast concerned with Southern African issues.

At the conference, we plan to include informational workshops where we can become better informed about Southern Africa and more action-oriented workshops dealing with the ways students and teachers can change government and corporate policy towards Southern Africa by mobilizing a constituency around Southern African issues.

As you perhaps know, students and faculty members have been organizing around the question of U.S. investments in Southern Africa over the last two years throughout the country. We ourselves have been actively involved in several campaigns dealing with Duke’s investments in Southern Africa. Last year we were able to win university approval for corporate withdrawal from South Africa. At our conference, we will have representatives from the various student movements and groups involved with Southern African work. If you would be interested in attending the conference please contact:
