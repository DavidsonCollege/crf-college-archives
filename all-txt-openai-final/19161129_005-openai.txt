**The Tar Heel**—A basketball league will be organized at the University of North Carolina on a new plan this year.
Any man can play on his respective class team whether he has played Varsity ball or not. The games will
be played from December 1st to the Christmas vacation. After the holidays, the coach will select the men to compose
the Varsity squad, and the remaining players will then form into their respective class teams and play the regular inter-class
series for the class championship.

**The Virginia Tech**—A clipping from the Baltimore Sun claims that Younger and Gregory, of V. P. I., are the finest
pair of ends playing in college circles. Mention is made of several other players, and asserts that these men deserve
consideration when it comes to picking an All-South Atlantic team.

**The Cadet**—A campaign has been started at the Virginia Military Institute to raise a fund for the erection of a
memorial to General Francis H. Smith, the first Superintendent of the Institute. The memorial is to be placed in front
of the superintendent's quarters and is to represent General Smith delivering a diploma and a Bible to a graduate, which
was his invariable custom.
