“If our pitchers come through, we'll have a good season,” remarked coach Tom Stevens, commenting on the 1958 Wildcat baseball
squad. Stevens expects southpaws Allen Moore and Dave Page, along with righthanders Dee Green and Dee Lide to share most
of the mound duties. He also looks for two freshman prospects, Freddy Pharr and Drew White, to help out.

VETERAN INFIELD
With the exception of second base, the infield will feature a veteran line-up. George Hart, second team all-conference first baseman
last year, will be at the initial sack. Russ Cotton, whom Stevens rates a good freshman prospect, will be the
lone newcomer in the infield, holding down second base. John Patterson, moving from second, will man third base, backed up
by Dabney Stuart. Don Killian will handle the shortstop chores. The outfield, another problem for Stevens, will probably be composed
of team captain Shelbourne Wallace, Richmond Rucker, and freshman Bill Joyner. Coach Stevens said that he may move Green and
Page to the outfield, as they have proven to be good hitters.

REAGAN RETURNS
Harold Reagan, who lettered as a freshman catcher two seasons ago, will return to do the receiving. Except for a
rather full period in the early portion of the schedule, coach Stevens was pleased with the slate. Opening encounter for
the Wildcats will be a road game with Lenoir Rhyne, on March 18. The first home contest will be played
three days later, a return encounter with the Bears from Hickory.

SOCCER MEETING
There will be a meeting on Monday, March 17, of all soccer players, in preparation for spring practice, which will
begin on that date and extend through March 28, according to Gordon Neville, captain of the 1958 booters. The meeting
will be held in the classroom on the balcony of the gym at 3:30 p.m. The two-week drill will be
supervised by coaches J. W. McCutchan and P. A. Marrotte.

Team For ‘58 Slate

By PRENTICE BROWN
With the coming of Spring and after a month of intermittent practice, the 1958 version of the Davidson track team
is beginning to take form. Coach Heath Whittle, admitting that this year’s charges will be somewhat weaker than the undefeated
1957 team, still has optimism for his apparently “rookie” squad. Those who will be sorely missed from last year's team
include: Pete Ashcraft, champion half-mile and miler; Mel Armstrong in the dashes; Al Elder in the 440, high jump and
broad jump; and Bill Gramley in the shot put and discus. Most of the burden therefore rests among the following
top returnees: Angus McBryde and Ray Antley in the two mile run; Jim Alexander and Henry Brown in the mile
run; Brownie Thurman in the 440 yard dash; “Diggs” Gramley in the shot and discus; John Huie in the pole
vault. The sprints will be handled by Marvin Bentley, Ed Kizer and John Heath West. The hurdles department will feature
Chris Bremer, Jim Hambright, Don McNeil and Bill Cannon. Some of the most promising newcomers are Roger Beebe in the
half mile run, Frank Cenegy in the discus, and Neal Pharr in the pole vault. The cindermen will open at
The Citadel on March 22, followed by a meet at Richmond March 28. The first local meet will be with
Wake Forest April 1. During the remainder of the season the ’Cats will meet Clemson, N. C. State, Furman and

Riflers Take Second
Closing out a “generally pleasing” spring practice, the Davidson football team concluded drills today, with all indications pointing to an
improved 1958 eleven. Craig Wall, rising senior halfback, was chosen captain for the Wildcat team earlier this week, with tackle
Charlie James named alternate captain. Coach Bill Dole said, “I am very pleased with the choice of Wall and James.”

In commending Wall's choice as captain, coach Dole said, “He is an exceptionally fine young man, and should provide the
team with excellent leadership. He is the fastest, best big man that I have had the opportunity to coach. Having
been switched from end to the backfield, he should make us a tremendous halfback.”

Dole noted that the spring practice has witnessed a lot of experimenting on the part of ’Cat coaches and team.
In addition to Wall's transfer from end to halfback, and George Hart moved from halfback to fullback. These changes have
resulted in the desired strengthening of the unit.

MORE OPEN ATTACK
Offensively, Dole stated, the Davidson attack has been changed to some extent. Wildcat grid fans can look for a more
open attack next year, and the probability of a two-unit offense.

Dole named a number of freshmen who have lent plenty of help to the ’Cat scene. He named Jennings Snider
and Gainy Wearn as two of the outstanding end prospects. Russ Cotton has played well at halfback, and quarterback Butch
Rogers, who did not play last season, has looked very good this spring, and is slated for plenty of action
in the fall.

Compiling a total score of 3571 out of a possible 4000, the Davidson ROTC rifle team captured runner-up honors in
the North Carolina Invitational ROTC Tournament at Wake Forest after last Saturday's firing. Dick Wilson was top firer for the
Wildcats, firing a 731 score for the two-phase tourney. Joe Wearn and Stan Gaines posted 717 scores for second place,

Davidson's swimming team traveled to the Southern Conference meet at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg last weekend. Although they had not
beaten a conference team during the regular season, and were expected to finish in last place, the tankmen turned in
an excellent performance and took a fourth place tie with Washington and Lee. Sophomore Tom Smith was the big surprise
for the Wildcats as he raced to a at V.M.I. On Monday evening, the Kappa Sigs pulled ahead after a
close first half and held a substantial lead over a determined squad until the final gun. Their 50-36 victory over
the gentlemen of the South gives them a first place with ten wins and no losses. Tied for second place
with eight wins and one loss are the K.A.s and Sigma Chis. The Phi Gams fell to the K.A.s by
a score of 39 to 34 with K.A. Fred Streetman emerging as high scorer in the game. Ben Harris led
