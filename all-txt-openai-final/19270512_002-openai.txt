AS THE ATHLETIC EDITOR SEES IT
BY RAYMOND LAKE

Two state records broken, and another state record established—how does that state track meet sound? Any college which can put out a man who steps off the 100-yard dash in 9.6 and the 220-yard dash in 21.8 is going some and deserves to be “put on the map.” We hardly know what to say he deserves. The official world’s record for the 100 is 9.5, and if Currie keeps improving like he has in the past, it looks as if it may be just a matter of time till the world’s record for the 100 will be held by “Currie of Davidson.” In our opinion, there’s nothing which could put a college on the map quicker or give it more prestige than for one of its men to hold a world’s record, and if this be the truth, it seems to us that Davidson has a real opportunity to “step out.” What's there to keep Davidson from having a representative at the next Olympic meet? Currie has come within 1-10th of a second of running the 100 as fast as it has ever been run before, and there’s no reason to believe that, with a world’s record at stake, he could not run it one or two-tenths of a second faster, and capture the world’s record title for old Davidson. There’s no doubt about the time for the 100, either. The track was measured for the record, and there were enough stopwatches for the time to be taken as absolutely correct. A try-out for the Olympics can surely be arranged for Currie, and if he should qualify, which is very probable, it seems to us that he should have a very good chance to come out at or near the first in the Olympic finals.

A great deal of space has rightly been given to the 100 yd. dash, but that’s not all the Davidson representatives did. Currie also pushed to the front in the 220 yd. dash, and lowered the state record in that also, running the distance only 1.3 seconds slower than Roland Locke, present holder of the world’s record in that event. The relay team, composed of Currie, Goodykoontz, Melton, and Pinkney, established a state record, running the mile distance in 3 minutes and 29 seconds. This is the first time that the relay race has been run at a North Carolina state meet, and the record established by the Wildcat runners is very good and should stand for quite a while.

“Monk” Mattox left after the last freshman game the other day for Columbus, Ga., where he will play baseball this summer. We are interested in “Monk” and will watch him with interest wherever he goes. We wish him the best of luck, and know that he will make a big addition to the Columbus team. “Monk” played with Columbus last year and was known as one of the best catchers in that section of the country. Before playing with Columbus, he was with the Carolina League, and his success there was just as marked as his success last year with the Southeastern League.

If the baseball team could have gotten together in all their games as well as they did in some of them, the recently closed season would probably have been quite a bit more successful. In the State game at Salisbury last week, Meadows pitched a wonderful game and was supported in unusual style. Littlejohn deserves especial credit for his fielding, playing the whole game and handling nine errors without making any error. The Techmen won the game by one run, but we have no complaint to make about the way the team played. In the third State game played here, the visitors looked for a while as if they might capture the deciding game, but the Wildcats soon “got going,” and in the end were on the long end of an 11 to 6 score. In looking back over the season, we can very easily see that, although the team did not win as many games as they might have, and although the outlook was mighty gloomy at times, still the season as a whole could have been much worse than it was, and we have no reason to be at all downcast. The old Wildcat spirit did its part and kept the team from being the bottom member of the Big Five teams, leaving that place to the State College nine, and placing the Wildcats close, two of them ending in a tie.

Wildcats Climb Out of Cellar by Administering Severe Drubbing in Third Wolfpack Encounter

Local Golfers Show Good Form in Contest

Davidson College Golf team defeated the Washington and Lee golfers at the Charlotte Country Club, Monday, by the score of 16 to 12. All the matches were exceedingly close after eighteen holes had been played. The morning matches ended with the winner of the match uncertain and only to be determined by the afternoon matches. In the matches of the morning, McGill of Davidson and Ball of Washington and Lee played over eighteen holes to break even at the end. Wolfe of Davidson defeated Lanier of Washington and Lee, 3 and 2. Martin of Davidson defeated Rector of Washington and Lee, 5 and 3. Oleson of Washington and Lee came through to defeat Love of Davidson, winning the first match for the Virginia boys, 3 and 2. Lingle of Davidson and Ward of Washington and Lee ended their match even at the eighteenth hole. Porter of Washington and Lee defeated Mills of Davidson by the score of 3 and 2.

The afternoon matches were played in foursomes, with McGill and Wolfe defeating Ball and Lanier, 5 and 3. Martin and Lingle defeated Rector and Ward, 4 and 3. Oleson and Porter defeated Mills and Love, to win Washington and Lee’s only victory in the foursome matches by the score of 3 and 2. Keen competition was shown throughout the entire match. Only a small crowd was present, but a rare sort of playing was exhibited by the men from both schools. Oleson and Porter played the best brand of golf for the Washington and Lee team while Wolfe played well for Davidson.

Fresh Tennis Team Returns From Trip

Davidson Freshmen tennis team won one match and tied another in a recent trip to Carolina and Oak Ridge. The Carolina match ended in a 5 to 1 victory, Pettus losing the only point to Palmore by the close score of 4-6; 6-3; 8-6. Johnston won over Merritt by the narrow margin 2-6; 7-5; 7-5; while the other two singles matches were won over Wilson and Merritt by the score of 6-4; 6-4; and DeCamp and Pettus won over Kendrick and Palmore in a two-set match 7-5; 6-4.

At Oak Ridge where the match ended in a tie, Halverstadt and Johnston defeated King and Scott by a score of 6-4; 5-7; 6-3. This was the first time the Oak Ridge pair had ever been defeated, therefore the Davidson men are to be highly praised. Pettus and DeCamp also won their match with Johnston and Welmon in a two-set match by 7-5; 6-4. DeCamp was the only one who was able to win in the singles. He defeated Reid 8-6; 6-0 for the only lone set of the match. Scott was able to win from Johnston only after playing a 20-game set which ended in Scott’s favor 11-9.

In the first meet which was held at Davidson, the Oak Ridge team defeated Davidson 5 to 1. After such a defeat it is considered a fine comeback to tie the match held on foreign territory. The team seems to be stronger in the doubles than in the singles. All points which were scored against the Wildkittens were made in the singles.

“How did the Smith wedding come off?”
“Fine, until the preacher...”asked the bride if she’d obey her husband.” “Then what?” “She replied, ‘Do you think I’m crazy!’ and the groom, who was in a sort of daze, replied, ‘I do.’”

State Techmen, on their own diamond, Wildcats landed on the offerings of Allgood to see the two teams lock clubs, but every one of the doubles matches was won.

Many Records Smashed by Stars in State Meet
Currie Lowers Two Records—Relay Team Wins 11 to 6
ALSO DOWN FURMAN

Take Final Game of Year From Furman Players—Visitors Use Three Pitchers

With new records being set in every event except the two hurdles and the javelin, the State track meet held at Greensboro Saturday proved to be an event which will be talked about for some time. Currie of Davidson made the most outstanding record when he lowered McPherson’s record of 9.9 seconds for the 100-yard dash to 9.6 seconds, which is only one-tenth of a second behind the world’s record. Currie also set a new mark when he ran the 220-yard dash in 21.8 seconds, beating the record of 22 seconds.

The visitors used three hurlers against the Davidson aggregation, Beall, Allgood, and Shelton. Beall was the most effective, pitching the first six innings, but was called in favor of Allgood near the close of the sixth when he showed a decided weakness. Allgood proved ineffective against the Davidson hitters and was replaced by Shelton, who pitched the last two frames. The Davidson hitters managed to get almost half their hits in three innings. Lucien Wells, Davidson twirler, allowed the Techmen only six hits that afternoon, five of these coming in the fourth stanza when State made an equal number of runs. He surrendered another hit in the sixth but blanked them for the other seven innings. Johnston, of Davidson, led in the hitting with three safeties out of five hits. Ratchford, also of Davidson, left fielder, made a beautiful shoestring catch of Hovis’ line drive and then doubled Regan off first base.

The new record holders, other than those already mentioned, include Sides of State who ran the 440-yard dash in 51.2 seconds, Woodward of Duke with two minutes flat for the 880-yard run, Elliott of Carolina with 4 minutes, 26.6 seconds for the mile, Pritchett of Carolina with 9 minutes, 57 seconds for the two miles, making seven new records on the track.

There were five new marks established in the field events as follows: Spurlock of Wayne with the 20-pound shot put at 76 feet 7 inches, Daniel of Wake Forest made a broad jump of 22 feet 1 and 5-8 inches, Brantley of Duke took the pole vault at 12 feet 2 inches, the next highest man going only 10 feet 9 inches, and McDowell of State with the new mark of 6 feet 1 and 3-4 inches in the high jump.

The only Davidson records which have been established this year are the two new marks made by Currie in the 100 and 220-yard dashes. These records were previously held by Goodykoontz with 10 seconds flat for the 100 and 22 seconds for the 220. Both these records were broken by Currie before the State meet. In the meet with V. P. I. he ran the 220 in 21.8 and in the Wake Forest meet he set a new mark of 9.7 seconds for the 100.

The Davidson Wildcats nine swamped the Furman team Saturday, in a game characterized by numerous hits on the part of the Davidson team, the game ending 16 to 5. Furman used three pitchers in an attempt to check the rain of blows, but all were ineffective, although Davis who came in in the third inning did creditably considering rather poor support. For the Wildcats, Cathey pitched an excellent game, allowing Furman but three hits while his teammates were rolling up a total of twenty safeties. Davidson exhibited a batting eye that has not characterized them heretofore, every Davidson player getting at least one safe bingle. Ratchford, of Davidson, led the hitting, getting a double and three singles out of five trips to the bat, while Johnson, also of Davidson, followed with a triple and two singles out of six times at bat. The game as a whole was rather uninteresting, slowed up by numerous errors on the part of both teams. The Furman team showed a noticeable weakness in their pitching staff, Jones starting the game for the visitors being sent to the showers in the third inning. McElveer who relieved him lasted only one third of an inning and was sent to right field to replace Davis who performed on the mound for the remainder of the game. Johnson and Littlejohn, both of Davidson, exhibited some very fancy catches during the game, while Ratchford played with his usual skill in the outfield. For Furman, Byrne led the hitting, getting two runs out of two trips to the bat.

“Wow-wow-wow-wow!” howled the future shortstop from the cradle. “Four bawls and I walk,” sighed the father as he slid from the nice warm bed to the cold, hard floor.

SPLIT DEBATE
(Continued from page 1)

proved by him, that there was no conflict in the marriage and divorce laws of the forty-eight states now, giving as an example a comparison of the laws of Tennessee with those of North Carolina. Another point brought out was the fact that in the United States there was too great a variety of public opinion, and that a national law couldn’t possibly bring the different factions together.

Horne, following Pritchett, and speaking for the affirmative, proved that a uniform law would remedy the existing evils under the present system and offered the law the affirmative would have enacted. The final speech of the evening, made by Sparger of the negative, gave an admittance of certain existing evils but declared that even if a national bill were enacted those evils would still exist. Sparger further proved, by law, that an amendment to the Constitution of the United States was necessary before such a nation-wide law could be established.
