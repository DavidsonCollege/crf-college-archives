This is the first of a series of
articles which will appear in The
Davidsonian this year under the
title, “Compassing Carolina Campuses.” This particular picture
story is entitled, “Life at W. C. U.
N. C.” The Women's College of
the University of North Carolina appears diversified with pictures of
horseback riding, archery, the Senior Formal Dance, a place for
study — the McIver Building — The
Tavern (which gets its name from
its appearance—not what they
serve), a Milk Bar and a group of
girls entertaining some soldiers.
