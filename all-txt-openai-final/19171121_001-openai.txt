No. 11 Davidson’s Share Wake Forest HumbledOversubscribed By Red and Black Splendid Total Made By Students/ Overwhelming Outclassed Despite Subscribers
to Fund. Weight. Score 72-7.

The Davidson Red-Skins left their hunting grounds Saturday and took the war-path to the city of Greensboro and there completely
massacred the settlers from Wake Forest. They returned to their wigwams and hung the scalp of Wake Forest to the
ridge pole, beside the scalps of Auburn and V. M. I. The final score was 72 to 7—that is as
far as the scorer could count. For the first few minutes of play, neither team seemed to have the advantage,
then the Davidson warriors drew out and left the Wake Forest team as victims of a steam-roller that could not
be stopped. Davidson politely asked Wake Forest to excuse her dust.

The Y. M. C. A. War Fund campaign was completed at Davidson last week. Never before in the history of
the college was there such a universal spirit of sacrifice as was manifested in this campaign. Davidson's share was $2,000.
To organize for the canvass of the student body about thirty-five prominent men were collected for a meeting Wednesday night.
At this meeting they were informed as to conditions and inspired to do their best. Seventeen couples were formed who
were to see every man in college the next night and solicit his subscription. As the meeting broke up it
was announced that the results would be counted at 11 o'clock the next night. The students responded nobly to the
appeal and the amount crept steadily nearer the goal, $2,000, as each additional couple came in and reported. At 20
minutes past 10, when the last team arrived and reported, a cheer broke out, for it was seen that Davidson
had exceeded her assigned amount by $18. Several additional subscriptions have been received since that time and with the $160
subscribed by the faculty, the total sum subscribed now amounts to $2,303.75.

The people of Davidson have not failed to do their share in this campaign. The amount raised was $660; $160
of which will go to the students’ fund. This speaks well for Davidson and shows that she deeply feels the
spirit of the times.

TWO DAVIDSON STUDENTS LEAVE FOR ACTIVE DUTY

With the mobilization of the Brenizer Hospital Unit, O. W. M. Gibson, ‘19, who is a member of this unit,
was called from his college work to join the colors. Gibson left for his home in Statesville, Friday, November 10,
and on the following Monday went to Charlotte to join the other members of the organization, there to await transportation
to Fort McPherson, Ga. After a short period of intensive training the unit expects to be sent to France.

R. W. Robinson, ‘19, enlisted with the Marines at the recruiting station in Charlotte on Monday of last week. On
Tuesday he left college for his home in Steele Creek, and on Thursday left Charlotte for Paris Island, S. C.,
where he will be in training for fourteen weeks. After a ten days’ furlough at the end of his training
he will be sent to a distribution camp, where he will await the call to active service.

FLOWERS.

For Davidson, to name her stars in this game would be practically to name her line-up. Flowers was the best
ground-gainer. For Wake Forest, Rabenhorst was her mainstay on offensive, and with Blanchard did most of her defensive work. Davidson
made about 25 first downs to Wake Forest’s 4—being held only once for downs. Wake Forest outweighed Davidson some 16
pounds per man, but her brawn couldn't stop Davidson's brain.

The line-up:

WAKE FOREST. POSITION. DAVIDSON
Bowers.................. Left End .......... King (C)
Gay...................... Left Tackle .......... Shaw
Williams................. Left Guard .......... Lackey
W. Crouch............... Center .......... McMaster
Blanchard............... Right Guard .......... Elliott
Rabenhorst.............. Right Tackle .......... Flowers
