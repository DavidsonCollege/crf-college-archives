Sophomores Win Interclass Track Meet; Juniors Win Second Place On Field Day

McMillan Features Meet With Broad Jump of 20 Feet—Henderson Wins Both Dashes

In the interclass track meet held here last Saturday morning, the Sophomores took first honors. Their representatives made a total
of 51 points. Second and third places in the meet were won by the Juniors and Freshmen with 35 and
22 points respectively. No places were made in any event by the Seniors. On account of the javelin breaking, this
contest had to be cancelled. With the exception of this and the pole vault, every other event of a regulation
track meet was run off.

C. C. McMillan, of the Junior class, furnished the surprise of the morning when he made a running broad jump
of 20 ft. 2 in. And this without having ever before been out for track. In an unofficial attempt, McMillan
jumped 22 feet. He will train with the Varsity squad the remainder of the season. Tom Baker copped second place
in both the mile and two-mile races for the Sophs. Henderson, of the Fresh class, showed himself the best man
in the 100 and 220 dashes. He easily outclassed his opponents. Parker also won two firsts for the Sophs, the
mile and the 440. Parker and Henderson tied as high point men, each making 10 points. No records were broken,
but several of the men who took part will, with some training, furnish excellent material for the Varsity squad in
future intercollegiate meets. The winning class will be awarded the Richardson Cup and each man who made either a first
or second place is to be given a prize.

Wildcat Golfers Enter Tournament at Atlanta
Earnhardt, DeArmon, Jones and Reeves to Represent Davidson in Southern Meet

The golf team, composed of Earnhardt, DeArmon, Jones and Reeves, left Tuesday for Atlanta to enter the golf tournament staged
by the Southern Intercollegiate Golf Association. This tournament is sponsored by Georgia Tech and is to be held at the
East Lake Country Club links, reputed as the best in the South. Thursday the medal play for the cup will
be held. The foursome from Davidson should present a formidable appearance since each man is a player of known skill.
As their opponents, they will find teams from such colleges as Vanderbilt, Georgia Tech, University ofAlabama, University of Tennessee, and
University of Georgia. Should the Davidson foursome fail to win the cup, even a creditable showing will be of great
advantage to Davidson’s athletics. On Friday, the individual play will begin and at least two of the Davidson golfers should
rank around the top. This is the second tournament of its kind to be held, the first being held at
the University of Tennessee last year. It will apparently become an annual affair and it is up to Davidson to
put teams on the field that will uphold Davidson’s reputation and come away fighting if not victorious. The object of
the tournaments is to promote interest in golfing throughout the Southern colleges and to furnish competition in this sport for
these colleges. It has been entered in fine spirit by most of the Southern colleges. This year marks Davidson's first
representation at the tournament.

Mrs. Paisley, who has been quite ill for some time, is improving. Mrs. J. M. McConnell, who has been visiting
in Charlottesville, has returned to Davidson.

Charlotte High Batters Beat Rawson's Kittens
Lanier’s Pitching Fools Davidson Fresh and Walks off with 8-2 Victory

The Davidson Wildkittens bowed to the Charlotte High School aggregation in a keenly contested game on Richardson Field last Saturday
afternoon to the tune of 8 to 2. The Wildkittens started off the game with a flash that led all
spectators to believe that the Charlotte team would be swept off their feet by a large margin, but those who
had done so were forced to change their opinions in the sixth inning when the Highs piled up four tallies
to their credit, giving the Freshies a good scare and showing them that the game had not yet been won.
Each team scored only five hits during the entire nine innings. All hits were singles except the one three-sacker that
was poled out by Schwartz in the ninth, scoring a man who was on first. Lanier, the winning pitcher, struck
out seven men, while Hampton, for Davidson, struck out five. Kiser, who went in for Hampton in the eighth inning,
blanked two men.

TENNIS MEN ENTER STATE MEET AT GREENSBORO

Next week the Wildcat racqueteers will journey to Greensboro to try again for the state championship in tennis which Davidson
has held for two consecutive years. Year before last, Bradley and Ormond won the doubles championship of the state and
Bradley the singles championship, giving Davidson a clear sweep. Last year, Bradley again copped the singles championship, but Staley and
Bradley lost the finals in the doubles, in a hard-fought match with Bruton and Jernigan, of Carolina. This year the
services of Bradley will be missed but the team is practicing daily and will go ready to give the best
they have for another try at the championship. Following the state meet, the team will play Carolina and Trinity on
their home grounds. The last match of the season will be played here with Carolina, on the return of the
Carolina team from the Southern meet in which Carolina was victorious two years ago.
