Blue Ridge

Under moonshine, under stars, a valley
cradled fog like water in cupped hands.
Black peaks linked round, rimmed

a bowl swirling, milky.

Fog tide drowned branchwaft;
muffled water chirps tumbling
over rock, water, over rock;

lapped at the sandbag retreat,
a cabin bulk.

Yellow windows
blinked awake from hibercountry.
Warm-tongued fog tasted cabin cane
as a dog tests hands then feet,
moistening needlepad roof before
mingling in woodpile.

Then like a scratch under chin,
behind ears,

fingers of smoke twitched out

the chimneystone sleeve to burrow
down in feather fog mane.
