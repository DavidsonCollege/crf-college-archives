### OIL (Continued from Page 3)

Of the colleges listed, 121 were all-women colleges and 99 all-men colleges; in the spring of 1968, the figures had
dropped to 97 women’s colleges and only 68 men’s colleges. At present, to the knowledge of the Commission, around 20
percent of the remaining single-sex colleges are considering becoming coeducational. As the alternative to coeducation, the single-sex college seems anachronistic.

The thinking of the Commission about Davidson and coeducation has been modified by financial and political considerations, as well as
by social and educational concerns and commitments. The Commission believes that Davidson can become coeducational without jeopardizing its healthy financial
situation, if, in the process of implementation, sufficient and capable planning accompanies the change. Its reasons for thinking as it
does are the success of other colleges in making the change, and the relatively advantageous financial position everyone seems to
agree that Davidson occupies at this time.

### Coeducation

In regard to what the College appears to be capable of, it may be useful to point out here that
the Commission’s not recommending a coordinate college is related only incidentally to what seems to be the extra cost of
such an undertaking. If a coordinate campus had seemed the wiser possibility to recommend, the Commission would have recommended it.
Men and women sharing one campus, one set of buildings, seems better to suit the social and educational needs of
our time.

As for political considerations, the Commission is aware that much preparation will have to be made for the introduction of
women to the Davidson campus. Two reasons seem to rank highest: one, if coeducation at Davidson is to become real
in fact and not merely in name, a great deal of planning, building, modifying, and the like has to take
place not only in the physical plant and in the administrative offices, but also in the minds of those affected
directly and indirectly by the change. Two, if coeducation is to come without adversely influencing Davidson's financial condition, major funds
will have to be raised now and later, to increase the endowment and to provide for increased operating costs.

This report is not written to persuade; the Commission hopes here only to reveal the bases for its recommendations. Another
report, and perhaps more than one, will have to be prepared, designed deliberately to convince those among the members of
the Board of Trustees, the alumni, friends, student body, and administration of the College that coeducation is indeed at this
time the wise decision to make.

The Commission wishes to emphasize that it is not obviously right for Davidson or for any single-sex college to become
coeducational at this time; but as the Commission sees it, the alternative to coeducation is not as attractive as it
has seemed to be in the past. Conscious that it does not wish to recommend that Davidson yield to a
passing fashion, or that it sacrifice long-range to short-range values, the Commission believes that the College must consider not only
the social and educational advantages and disadvantages of coeducation, but also Davidson's location in the South, and its history as
a church-related college and as a liberal arts college, before a decision is made.

More than ever before, perhaps, Davidson has an opportunity to examine what it is and what it seeks to do
in relation to the larger community of which it forms a part. In this part of its report, the thinking
of the Commission on the social and educational dimensions of Davidson and coeducation will be described. The Commission begins with
the assumption that the social life on the campus is largely unsatisfactory. That this is an assumption not shared by
everyone is abundantly clear; the comments on the alumni questionnaires reveal some sharp disagreements as to the significance, wholesomeness, and
the like of social conditions on the campus. Some alumni indicate that their social lives at Davidson were completely satisfactory;
others were not.

### Social Patterns (Continued from Page 2)

#### Other Aspects of the Social Program

We recommend that each residential unit conduct a broad program of recreational, athletic, and cultural activities.

#### The New, and Limited, Role of Social Fraternities

With respect to social fraternities, there are wide differences of opinion and conviction among the members of the commission. The
majority of the Commission feels that the institutionalized exclusiveness of social organizations has no place on the Davidson campus. The
majority of the Commission therefore believes that every student at Davidson College should have equal option for the kind of
social life he desires, whether it be in the residence hall, the College Union, or in a social fraternity.

In the light of the foregoing, we recommend that fraternities be allowed to pledge and initiate students from the three
upper classes, that the houses now furnished to the fraternities be put to other use, that the members of the
fraternities be provided the same social facilities as are provided for all students, that all resident students, whether members of
a fraternity or not, pay the social fees for their respective residential units, and that no additional social organizations with
selective membership be chartered by the college or Student Government Association.

We further recommend that the social fees be protected from diversions to any other uses.

#### Campus-Wide Social Activities

The natural center for campus-wide activities is the College Union. We recommend that a new College Union facility be constructed
around the following provisions:

1. To promote the function as the center of the campus community, there should be a post office and switchboard.
2. There should be a quality restaurant and snackbar facilities.
3. There should be office space for student-run and non-academic, student-oriented offices such as the Union Board, the Union Director,
SGA, RHA, DAVIDSONIAN, Chaplain.
4. Facilities which cannot be provided for students in residence halls should be provided, for example: music listening rooms, informal
discussion rooms, magazine room, game room, and arts and crafts center.
5. A guest house of good quality should be included.

We also recommend that efforts be made to ensure that the union program is directed to meet the needs of
all the members of the campus community, and that it also make the best possible use of the resources (in
personnel and physical facilities) available to it in that community.

### MINORITY REPORT

#### Dissenting from Anti-Fraternity Section

The majority of the Social Patterns Commission has concluded that fraternities are anathema at Davidson and must be exorcized. Judging
from the recent past, it is predictable that their conclusions will be shared (in advance) by the majority of the
Davidson faculty and the minority of Davidson students. Perhaps this is the year in which the steady anti-fraternity pressure of
the past dozen years will finally claim its victim. The grounds have been carefully prepared by the Commission and its
predecessors, some of whom are duly immortalized with selected quotations in the Report of the Majority.

It has been most pleasant to dissent from the view of the majority, because of their personal graciousness and patient
tolerance of this badly outclassed adversary and it was determined from the start that my prejudices deviated from the consensus
prejudice. The obligation of somehow expressing a minority view is probably a futile one, since in matters of opinion one
must either be a majority or an authority. Being neither, I feel further encumbered by the thinly veiled attitude of
some Commission members and witnesses that any defense of Davidson’s fraternity system must be immoral, insensitive, and inhumane (and “evil”).

I suggest that this defense is probably futile, furthermore, because I recognize that this Commission has seized upon a tactical
device that escaped the designs of earlier committees. Rather than a frontal assault on the emasculation of the Constitutional (in
the sense of both the U.S. Constitution and the internal Fraternity Codes) membership practices of the fraternities, this Commission has
concentrated its recommendations toward the emasculation of the fraternity organizations. In effect, the Commission is recommending: Let them choose members
any legal way they prefer, but don't let them perform any of the organizational functions of serving their members.

Fraternities, alone among the organizations and programs of Davidson College, are to be relegated to 19th Century status—if that! This
is simply an indirect plan for abolition. The Commission decrees “stately pleasure dorms,” whose magnificent programs are somehow to bring
a Utopia of social activity for all and acceptance for the underprivileged. If the present students thought they would fare
better with meals, parties, and teams limited to some arbitrarily social-engineered collection of fellow dorm-tenants, they would surely have taken
better advantage of their free opportunities to do so. That some few have chosen not to join fraternities or to
deactivate their membership does not per se prove that these few are more perceptive than the others (insensitive clods?) who
thrive on fraternity activities. It merely proves that there is no serious barrier to a student who chooses to bypass
fraternities.

I am unable to believe that future generations of students are going to develop any significant degree of loyalty to
their random-assignment Superdorms. The Commission’s prophecy that future administrators will somehow exploit such dorm-loyalty toward the Purpose and Goals of
the College is more a day-dream than a vision. There is, of course, the possibility that the composition of future
student bodies will be altered markedly as the fame spreads of this new welfare state for the intelligentsia.

Unfettered from the allegedly inhibiting conformity of what a former administrator, in a famous parlor-style demonstration of group psychoanalysis, diagnosed
for the Davidson faculty as “the Fraternity Mentality,” will our future students somehow not object to the New Conformity?

Contrary to the popular lip-service to “greater self-determination for today's more mature student,” the Commission is proposing that in the
realm of voluntary free association we are going to protect our charges from the evil demon of selected membership, because
as we all know, To Select is To Exclude and the carefully conjured “Exclusion Principle” has become the fashionable scapegoat
of the past decade. It is imagined that if we can just de-emphasize fraternities into obscurity, then those students who
have social inadequacies will be protected from the brutality of exclusionism long enough to evolve socially. It just might work
if all the other students will just suppress their evil desires to choose their own friends. They must accept their
assigned friends secure in the knowledge that whom the admissions committee selected (small “s” — of course), and the dormitory
assignment plan has grouped, must be the best of all possible worlds for broadening one’s horizon through stimulation, diversified interpersonal
relationships, etc., etc.

Early in the Commission's deliberations I had supported the concept of providing more attractive options for Davidson students, whereby fraternities
would have been healthily and partially de-emphasized by the advent of subsidized exciting alternatives. Apparently this won't do. The Commission
has judged that its proposal will be better and more exciting than the present system and free of Evil. It
has judged, however, that the majority of Davidson students won't accept the virtues of these proposals if they are alternatives,
competing with a fraternity option. (Where did the admissions committee go wrong?)

Therefore, the Commission has concluded that the New Age must be ushered in by techniques of Prohibition and Benevolent Paternalism.
The Commission majority urges that if fraternity membership be not open to ALL (which, I would suggest, is an internally
contradictory concept), then it must be open to NONE in any meaningful way. This latter resolution is by no means
internally contradictory, although it does raise the question of whether the same principle of anti-elitism will be applied to any
other organizations or programs of Davidson College.

(See SOCIAL, Page 6)Commission that those alumni who wish to change nothing are looking towards the past, while those who
wish to change Davidson to a coeducational college are more conscious of the demands of the present and, apparently, of
the future. As one alumnus (in favor of coeducation) wrote, "The trend is apparent. Coeducation is coming. How much better
to take the necessary steps before it is thrust upon us." That this comes close to saying that the College
should go in the direction that every other college is following is true. The Commission believes that in this case
the thinking which is essentially normal, however, recognizes the desirable mingling of the sexes during the crucial four college years
is sound thinking for which there will be connection reasons described in the educational advantages of coeducation.

In conversation with people at other colleges, the members of the Commission have discovered that women may suffer in some
ways from being educated apart from men, and that men also may suffer in some ways from being educated apart
from women. For example, some people believe that such a thing as an undesirable "sexual barrier" exists between men and
women, and that it is perpetuated in sexually segregated institutions. Again, women apparently need to develop and define their femininity
in relation not to other women, but in relation to men; and this often they apparently cannot or do not
do in isolation from men. Men, on the other hand, while apparently developing and defining their masculinity in relation to
other men, regardless of the presence of women, do not develop as early as women do the social maturity necessary
to the good life, and need women to promote that aspect of their growth. Among the academically talented, these limitations
tend to be exacerbated.

The Commission is aware that to ascertain precisely the benefits of coeducation is difficult; what it offers here is a
statement of opinion. Undoubtedly if Davidson becomes coeducational the social behavior of the men then on the campus will be
restricted and changed; how, and how much, it is impossible to predict accurately. Having become aware of the fact, the
Commission has put that eventually together with other social concerns, and attempted to arrive at recommendations designed to anticipate opportunities
which may be created, as well as problems which may occur. Recommendations 2, 3, and 4 reflect a part of
that thinking.

The healthiest ratio of men to women, in the experience of most of the colleges known to the Commission, is
three men to two women. Because women tend to be better qualified for admission to college, this ratio, if achieved,
will require active recruitment and a refusal to reduce the number of men required to maintain the 3:2 ratio as
the minimum. Sophomore and junior women transfer students will serve to implement full coeducation sooner than otherwise would be possible,
and, more importantly, to provide friendship and experience for the freshmen women on the campus.

The consensus of the Commission is that the modification of the present physical plant should be done with awareness that
it is perfectly possible for coeducation to exist in name only, at Davidson as it does on some other campuses.
Informal contact in the halls and in classrooms and on the walks must be supplemented by informal contact in a
variety of situations and places, made possible by skillful planning and building. At Davidson, for example, the eating situation is
one which needs to be changed now, and will demand to be changed before coeducation can exist in fact.

The Commission has some reason to think that coeducation does change, usually for the better, standards of dress, manners, and
the like on college campuses. Likewise, considering Davidson's rural location, coeducation seems desirable. The Commission does not think that weekend
travel will disappear; it thinks rather that the social lives of the students on the campus will be enriched. The
Commission is also aware that academically talented students tend to be immature; and that especially in a relatively isolated situation,
such as that of the Davidson campus, relationships tend to form quickly, grow intensively, and to be difficult to break,
when, as often happens, the time comes for them to be ended.

As for the sexual conduct of students on a coeducational campus, the Commission is aware that probably it will be
worse than useless to attempt to apply old standards to control sexual behavior. In all likelihood, the students will engage
in a long war of attrition, to the detriment of everyone, as they press for freedoms in line with contemporary
morality. Perhaps there is a paradox here, that while the social lives of the students are the College’s responsibility to
foster, the sexual lives of the students are their own responsibility. The experience of other colleges suggests that with increased
freedom, such as that provided by open or coed dormitories, students tend to need increased counseling and other help, and
the college is expected to provide the help needed.

As for educational concerns and commitments, the Commission is eager to repeat its belief that Davidson should not become coeducational
unless it can do so without jeopardizing those programs now in operation and other programs (such as those which form
a part of the Blue Sky Curriculum) planned for the near future. It would be remiss, however, if it did
not state here also that the success of present and planned programs may be related to the implementation of coeducation.
Those programs depend in large part on highly qualified and highly motivated students; and it is these students, the men
especially, perhaps, who seem to be choosing the public, coeducational institutions, and not the private, single-sex colleges. One of the
ways to secure a highly qualified student body is to become coeducational; women may enhance even the present high quality
of students at Davidson.

The Commission believes that coeducation will increase Davidson's flexibility in a number of areas. In admissions, it is common knowledge
that the coeducational institution has an edge on its single-sex competitors because of its ability to attract the students it
wants. Briefly, it seems that coeducational colleges have a larger number of qualified applicants to work with. An all-men’s college
becoming coeducational is also in an exceptionally favorable position these days; many well-qualified women wish to attend a previously all-men’s
college. In terms of the programs a liberal arts college offers, it appears that the presence of women on the
campus may result in better use of these programs. Men and women specialize, but not in equal numbers, in the
same things. This statement applies to the sciences and to the humanities although sometimes it is heard that women endanger
the situation in the sciences; they do, if they are present in such large numbers that there are not sufficient
men enrolled to give the sciences the population they need. Women excel in the sciences, but not as many women
as men elect to major in a science.

Inclined as it is to view seriously Davidson's responsibility to the community and the region, the Commission would welcome the
enlargement of the education department, for example; and, again on the basis of its evidence, it has no reason to
fear the diminution of any department. The Commission has no evidence that a system of education (at the college or
any other level) has been invented yet which will keep an able student from getting an education if he wants
one. It is aware that traditionally the most successful institutions of higher education have been single-sex institutions. It is also
aware of the candid disagreements among teachers about the effect, real or probable, of women discussing, and listening, together in
the classroom and outside of it as well. It believes that education will be improved at Davidson, that is, for
a number of reasons, if at this time the College becomes coeducational.

The Commission does not see coeducation apart from the times in which we are now living, nor does it see
it as a single, indispensable element in successful education at Davidson. The society in which we now live as well
as the specific conditions in which colleges are now operating seem to make coeducation desirable and even necessary, if Davidson
is to be engaged actively in the world. In the education of men and women today, any artificial separation of
the sexes seems to the Commission unwise, and potentially destructive of the intellectual, social, and personal values that we are
most concerned to develop.

FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

To estimate the cost of Davidson's becoming coeducational, the Commission asked, "What additional facilities and personnel would be needed if
500 women should be added to the student body?" The Commission recognized, of course, that expansion of some facilities is
needed regardless of any change in the composition of the student body. Expansion of the student body to 1500 would
necessitate little increase in facilities used for purely academic purposes beyond those that already exist or are already planned. The
new library would have to contain more seating than is being planned for a student body of 1000, but the
present library building consists of 40,000 square feet of space that could be used for classrooms, laboratories, and offices. Furthermore,
classroom space already in existence is not used as extensively as it might be. On the average, less than 40
percent of the classrooms are in use during the learning periods, and this does not include the 1:00-1:50 period which
could become available if the serving time for lunch were spread over two class periods.

Facilities required in the area of student services would have to be expanded. An additional 500 students would have to
be housed, necessitating the construction of at least 50 percent more dormitory space than now exists. The present union would
have to be expanded to provide adequate dining facilities, unless the Chambers Dining Hall, now used for registration, testing, and
occasional social functions, is used again for eating. The gymnasium would have to be expanded and the infirmary would have
to be remodeled.

As for personnel, it is found that an addition of 500 students, men or women, would require the addition of
11 faculty members, assuming no change in the six-course teaching load and no enrichment of the present curriculum. This figure
was based on the evidence that the present student-faculty ratio be maintained in accord with the present policy.

RECOMMENDATIONS

(1) That Davidson become coeducational at the earliest appropriate time consistent with the continued development of present educational programs and
of planned educational programs such as the honors college, the South Asia studies program, and the career/service program; and without
weakening the present endowment per student;

(2) That enrollment become 1500 and that a 3:2 men to women ratio be the minimum acceptable;

(3) That qualified sophomore and junior women transfer students, in addition to qualified freshmen women, be admitted in order to
produce an effective transition;

(4) That the existing physical plant be modified to accommodate women in residence;

(5) That a low student-faculty ratio be maintained, in accord with the present policy;

(6) That a new and appropriate educational program be developed simultaneously with the implementation of coeducation;

(7) That the advent of coeducation at Davidson be prepared for in detail;

(8) That Davidson's statement of purpose be rewritten to express the College's new social and educational opportunities and responsibilities;

(9) That as an additional way of implementing coeducation at Davidson the College participate in exchange programs with women’s colleges.
