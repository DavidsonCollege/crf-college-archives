**Sports Baseball Team Clobbers Furman, The Citadel**

By EDWIN PAGE

Last weekend the Davidson baseball team attained the goal they have been striving for all season. By sweeping three games
from Furman, while Western Carolina did the same to The Citadel, the Cats assured themselves of having one of the
four conference playoff spots. While this was wonderful news for the Cats, perhaps just as wonderful was the manner in
which the sweep was accomplished. For the first time in the conference season, Davidson’s pitchers emerged from the shadows of
the Cats’ big bats to lead the team. Junior Scott Weaver, freshman David Fitzgerald, and sophomore Steve Condon all pitched
complete games and yielded only one, two, and three runs respectively.

While the Cats have been pounding out hits and pushing across multitudes of runs this season, the pitching has been
less than spectacular. But against Furman, that changed. Weaver dominated The Paladins, yielding the lone run without surrendering a hit
in the inning. In the nightcap, Fitzgerald used the whole ballpark, including the warning track, to retire the Furman hitters.
Over the seven innings, Fitzgerald allowed only five hits en route to the victory. On Sunday, Condon worked the first
complete game of his college career to collect his fourth win and even his record for the season.

While the pitching came alive, the hitters continued producing runs. Sophomore Mark Thompson had a home run and a double,
and freshman Bill Masse had three hits as the Cats collected nine runs to back Weaver. In the second game,
the Cats were the beneficiaries of some Furman gratuities, collecting five runs on only four hits. Weaver put Davidson ahead
to stay in the second when, following two Furman errors, he delivered a two-run single. On Sunday, it was Weaver
again who keyed the Cats. He drilled a three-run homer in the first to stake the team to a 4-0
lead as the Cats rolled to the 10-3 win.

The sweep put the Cats at 8-5 in the conference and this weekend they face first-place Western Carolina (11-3) at
home for a three-game series. A bit of simple math will show that if Davidson can manage a sweep, they
will finish ahead of Western. Not only would a first-place finish put a great cap on the dramatic turnaround from
last year’s 5-12 conference record, but it would allow the Cats to bypass Appalachian State in the first round of
the playoffs. Team coach George Greer rates ASU as one of the best teams in the conference but feels that
the rest of the Northern Division teams are a notch down. A sweep will not be easy, but according to
Weaver, “If we play the way we've been playing and get the kind of pitching we got this weekend, we'll
win three.”

**Tennis Regroups In Preparation For Tournament**

By JOE JOHNSON

The men’s tennis team generated good news and bad news this week. The bad is this: UNC-Charlotte defeated Davidson for
the first time since the dawn of civilization. The good is this: the insufferable anguish invariably brought about by losing
to UNCC in anything has apparently initiated a massive turnabout that may well result in Davidson's finest Southern Conference Tournament
finish in recent years.

Davidson (i.e., hard and fast) courts of UNCC. The nice thing about 4-2 leads is that their possessors can only
lose by dropping all three doubles matches. Alas, so it was that the Cats did that very thing. That occurrence
was all the more unlikely given that both the second doubles tandem, senior John Hackett and sophomore Trip Caldwell, and
the third, sophomore Michael Meyer and freshman Jim Thompson, held indicates, the Cats lost to the mighty Paladins of Furman,
7-2. Three matches went to three sets (meaning we could have WON, dammit) against a team that led league-leading Tennessee-Chattanooga
4-2 before falling 5-4 (The nice thing about 4-2 leads...)

Saturday morning brought an encouraging 8-1 victory over ETSU, a team which according to Coach Frank is “probably the number
four team in the conference behind UTC, Furman, and [Davidson].” The Cats swept all six singles matches to secure the
win early. For a description of Davidson's 9-0 afternoon triumph, see the above section concerning Greensboro College. Two interesting and
possibly relevant sidenotes: 1) VMI also played Furman and ETSU at Davidson during the weekend and also lost 9-0 to
each. One can only hope they find time to play Greensboro for a shot of pre-tournament confidence. 2) Davidson is
undefeated this year in those matches in which they have swept all six singles. The home schedule has been completed,
but the Cats travel to J.C. Smith, Appalachian State, and Western Carolina next week for a tough three-match warmup to
the tournament.

**GOLF Team Gears Up For Conference**

The story begins April 4 with a thriller in Greensboro, where our heroes pulled out a 9-0 squeaker over hapless
Greensboro College. By far the most exciting moments of the trip were spent in McDonald’s after the match waiting to
see if the Quarter Pounders would have pickles or not; everything else wasa foregone conclusion. On to the April 8
tragedy in Charlotte: the Good Guys led 4-2 after the six singles matches had been completed on the very non-
After general re-grouping and extensive corporal punishment administered by Coach Frank, the Wildcats traveled the next day to Pfeiffer, the
only team on the 1985 schedule named after the sound soft toilet paper makes when squeezed. Fuzz removal was the
order of the day, and Davidson left with a 9-0 victory. The weekend saw a quadrangular home spectacle featuring Furman,
VMI, and East Tennessee State. In a Friday afternoon match much closer than the score.

After getting off to a slow start this season, the men’s golf team had two impressive finishes last week. On
Wednesday the team grabbed sixth place out of 19 teams in the Belmont Abbey Invitational. Senior co-captain Steve MacMillan paced
the team with a 75 and finished fifth individually. Sophomore Tom Davis shot 78. On Friday the team faced Catawba,
Gardner Webb, and Western Carolina at Charlotte Country Club. Davis led the field with a fine 77, and MacMillan, junior
Bob Carr, and sophomore Tyler Long supplemented the attack as Davidson won by six strokes. The match marked the first
time this spring that Davidson has defeated conference rival Western. Earlier in the season the team traveled to Charleston, SC
to play in the Citadel Invitational. Although the team played well, stiff competition dropped them to an eighth-place finish out
of 12 teams. Davis and senior co-captain Todd Wiebusch led the team with identical scores of 81-78. In the Elon
Tournament in Burlington, Carr shot 80-76 and Davis shot 79-80 to lead Davidson to a disappointing 17th-place finish in the
22-team tournament. The team is now preparing for the Southern Conference tournament which runs Monday through Wednesday of this week.

Frisbee Golfers Tee Off In Annual Tournament

By SCOTT HUIE

Frisbee golf is booming across America, and now you members of the Davidson community have an opportunity to take part
in this sports phenomenon. Named after one of Davidson’s most illustrious presidents and most avid frisbee enthusiasts, L. Grier Martin,
the 3rd Annual Davidson Frisbee Golf Tournament will be held tomorrow on the grounds of Davidson College from 10 a.m.
to 4 p.m. It promises to challenge and entertain all participants, regardless of past frisbee experience. Frisbee golf is played
like regular golf, only a frisbee is thrown at a target rather than a ball hit into a cup. Already
some of the touring pros are engaged in intense preparation, polishing up on their putting and working on their chip
shots as well. Some are even partaking in verbal warfare. Here are some excerpts:

—Dr. David Shi: “Ortmayer, Slagle, and Kazee have long been bragging about their golf game, but put a frisbee in
their hands and they quickly reveal the wimps that they truly are. While the rest of us in the 60s
were doing something significant, i.e. throwing frisbees, they were drinking beer and chasing women. Now the results of their depravity
will be brought to light.”

—Dr. Peter Krentz: “Ortmayer has been working on his bulk to get more behind his frisbee golf drive. It’s ruined
his volleyball game, but we hope it will pay off this weekend.”

—Dr. Tom Kazee: “In real golf, the problem with Ortmayer’s game is that he can’t see the tee anymore. Maybe
he’ll have better luck in frisbee golf. Concerning Lewis, someone from Ohio State ought to be good at this sport.
That’s all they did. Maybe we could paint a peace sign on her frisbee to get her to play.”

—Dr. Cynthia Lewis: “A peace sign, huh, well you'll have to check Kazee’s I.D. to make sure he’s old enough
to play.”

—Mr. Matt Merrill: “Down here in admissions, we all are athletes—except for maybe Steve Soud—so we’re gonna win that tournament.”

—Coach Charlie Slagle: “Kazee worked at Tulane before he came here. So I think he’s trying to fix this tournament.”

—Dr. Lou Ortmayer: “Krentz can’t spike in frisbee golf; he’s just a loser. Kazee’s frisbee golf could be pretty good
if he could keep it in play. As for Shi, keeping it simple is not a philosophy of life, it’s
an athletic mandate.”

—Dr. Karl Plank: “The apostle Paul invented frisbee golf.”

—Dr. Trent Foley: “I don’t have tenure yet, so I’m reluctant to say that McKelway couldn’t hit the broad side
of a barn from three feet with a frisbee.”

—Dr. Charles Ratliff: “Our Eco. majors will beat the religion majors regardless of who they may think are on their
side.”

—Dr. Price Zimmermann: “Kuykendall is a pretty good frisbee golf player, to hear him talk.”

—Kazee: “If Kuykendall plays frisbee golf like he plays softball, then he’s gonna trip over the first tee.”

—Dr. John Kuykendall: “I will win this frisbee golf tournament—period.”

There you have it folks: the jabs, the challenges, the freshly cut greens, the media, the frisbees. All the elements
are in place for the major frisbee golf tournament of the year. And the winner is...
