THE DAVIDSONIAN, NOVEMBER 18, 1926

VOLUNTEER BAND MEETS

Dr. K. J. Foreman of the faculty led the Volunteer Band in an open discussion on the “Religions of the
World,” at their regular meeting, Sunday at ten o’clock. The president, J. A. McAlpine, opened the meeting by calling for
a few songs, after which a few minutes of the open period were held. Mr. Foreman ably discussed the religions
of many nations. He called for the ideas of many of the members, who responded with either a question or
an answer. Quite a few visitors attended the meeting and they also added their ideas to those of the students
on the religions of other countries. A short business session was presided over by the president of the band, J.
A. McAlpine. Matters of interest and business to the club were discussed in a brief period preceding the main talk.
The aim of the club, to stimulate a desire for going to the foreign fields or to arouse interest in
the foreign mission work, is carried out in every program. The topic for the next meeting will be the “History
of Missions in China.” It has not yet been decided as to who will lead this meeting, but it is
thought the speakers will be chosen from the band.

Messrs. John Currie, Sam Currie, Neil Currie, and Neil McMillan spent the week-end with Mr. Daniel Currie.

Dr. Charlie Attributes Victory to Luck Omens
Negro Trainee Believes in His Horseshoes and Rabbit Feet

Various things have been attributed as the reason for the Wildcat victory over Carolina here last Saturday, when the Davidson
team defeated the Tar Heels, 10 to 0. But it is the belief of one Charlie Wilson, negro, who looks
after the ailments of the individual players, that “Lady Luck” showed her face that day. “Doctor” Charlie, as he is
known to students, was gloriously bedecked Saturday with two large rabbit feet dangling from his white coat elaborately decorated with
a snarling Wildcat in front. Not content with his public display in luck, he had put a rabbit foot inside
the football, buried another under one of the goals, and not even satisfied with that, turned to another phase of
luck, burying a horseshoe under the other. Nothing was known of the last three silent emblems of luck, but the
two feet upon his coat were noticeably prominent to spectators. After the game, he took his spade and dug up
the horseshoe and rabbit foot, and claims them now as his most treasured possessions. Very few alumni were as proud
as Charlie when the last whistle sounded and Wildcats had won by the largest margin for Davidson in the history
of the two institutions.

The freshman team has proven a disappointment. Starting off with a whirlwind drive when they defeated Furman Fresh, and then
losing to Blue Ridge, Duke, and State, we were disappointed. When we realize that we are losing so many players
from the Varsity this year, we are downcast again. But then we look at this fresh bunch and see men
like Hampton, Hunt, DeArmond, Carson, Brohard, and the others, our stock takes a rise, for they will be ready to
step in and help fill up these gaps next year. Again, it has encouraged us.

Many Alumni Return for Annual Home-Coming
Eight States and Forty-Six Classes Furnish Visitors

Many old Davidson Alumni were on the campus for Home-Coming Day and quite a number of them came by the
office of the Alumni Secretary and put their names in the register. Every class since 1871 was represented except nine
last Saturday, a total of 46 classes. Two Davidson men who finished in ‘71 were back at the school, while
several more attended the celebration from other classes in the ‘70s. The oldest represented is the class of ’71.| Alumni
were here from the classes on the campus who did not get to sign the register in the office of
the alumni secretary, while hundreds from the later classes returned. Eight different states had representatives here, as well as Washington,
D.C. Alumni were registered from Virginia, West Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, Mississippi, and Tennessee, many of them
making long automobile journeys to Davidson for the festive occasion and the Carolina game in the afternoon.

At the homecoming exercises in the morning last year, but a handful of students, alumni, and visitors attended the exercises,
while approximately 1,500 people occupied the new concrete stadium at Davidson for the first time Saturday morning to listen to
the dedicatory exercises of the field and stadium given by H. S. and L. Richardson, Greensboro, and a stirring address
by Dr. A. A. McGeachy, of Charlotte. Both the letter from the Richardson brothers and the speech of Dr. McGeachy
were frequently applauded for their optimism.

Hundreds who were not present for the morning events attended the University of North Carolina-Davidson football game in the afternoon—among
them being many former football players—while numerous ones remained over for the weekend. The closing event was a stunt night
performance, at which standing room was at a premium.
