WRIGLEY'S

Why are WRIGLEY'S flavors like the pyramids of Egypt? Because they are long-lasting.

MR. JACKSON EFFICIENT
(Continued from page 1)

College and graduated with the class of 1909. Afterwards, he finished a course of general accountancy and commercial law at the Walton School of Commerce, Chicago. He taught one year at Mayesville, S.C., and then two years at Belmont, N.C. During the period of 1909-13, he was Secretary and Treasurer and Business Manager of the Mountain Retreat Association at Montreat. Here he also operated the two hotels during the summer seasons. Mr. Jackson was elected Treasurer and Business Manager of Davidson College at the Trustees’ meeting at Commencement, 1913, and took up his work at the college in November of that year. He passed in 1917 the North Carolina State Board examination for Certified Public Accountant. His work at Davidson in putting the college finances on an up-to-date business basis has been much more valuable than a casual observer would realize. Reports from auditors of the college records speak very highly of his work. Prior to Mr. Jackson’s coming, many of the administrative duties were divided among the members of the faculty. These have been centralized and this is a great convenience to the students, and makes a much more smoothly working system. Mr. Jackson began a course in Accounting during the S.A.T.C. This has proved so popular that it is now a permanent part of Davidson’s curriculum. To sum up Mr. Jackson as he looks to a student, one word is necessary—efficiency. Performing almost daily a host of duties, always ready to straighten out any difficulty that happens. Himself a perfect machine, he makes the affairs of the college a true reflection of himself. He touches the life of the student at many points, and it is always to make things more pleasant. He means much to the college—as an administrator, we admire him; as a friend, we love him.

And WRIGLEY'S is a beneficial as well as long-lasting treat. It helps appetite and digestion, keeps teeth clean and breath sweet, allays thirst.

DAVIDSONIAN BANQUET
(Continued from page 1)

the paper and possible improvements. Then the guests were honored by a few words from two of the ladies present. Mrs. J. P. Caldwell, of The Charlotte Observer, spoke on the excellence of The Davidsonian as a college publication, and Miss Lavinia Boyer, as sponsor of the banquet, expressed most charmingly her sentiments on being chosen as sponsor of such a paper.

The last speech of the evening was delivered by Colonel Kirkpatrick, on a subject that held the interest of everyone present, “The Wilson Highway.” And when he announced it was his intention to see the scheme carried out by the end of 18 months and to have Davidson College and Charlotte connected by a paved highway and electric lighted, it was heartily applauded. He was of the opinion that this highway would be a connecting link which would by all means make Charlotte a greater city and Davidson a larger and much more attractive college.

The banquet from the standpoint of eats was a howling success. It was an easy matter to tell that the younger members of the party were from Davidson, although after 10 courses they all appeared happy and well satisfied. The dinner was excellent in preparation and serving. The menu cards were as follows:
