A Letter

To Santa...

THE DAVIDSONIAN

PAGE FIVE

Dear Santa,

I'm convinced now that there is nothing more welcome nor personal than a gift of jewelry at Christmas time. How did I arrive at such a momentous decision? I happened to stop at Ivey's jewelry department the other day. (It's a difficult place to pass at any time of year). It was easy! Before my eyes was a fabulous spread of necklaces, earrings, pins, and compacts in gold and silver. Many were set with brilliant stones in every delightful color of the rainbow. Prices were from 1.00 to 100.00 for the finest strand of cultured pearls.

So Santa, now that I have done my scouting, things will be easier for you. Take your choice at Ivey's Costume Jewelry Department. You'll find all my favorites there.

Love,

P.S. I'm telling my friends about this too.
