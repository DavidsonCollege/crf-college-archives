Brown runs Grim’s in ‘kneaded’ turnover

By ANN WICKER
Staff Writer

It's after midnight. Suddenly in the stillness, the rumble of a stomach crying for munchies is heard. The bleary-eyed Davidson
student, nodding over Understanding the Old Testament or some other obscure text, looks up. The thought of another nacho cheese
Dorito from 7-11 doesn’t make it.

Never fear, for there is another place where the munchie monster may feed. In the ancient legends of Davidson College,
this is the place known to us as Grim’s.

As far back as anyone cares to remember, there has been a bakery on Main Street in Mooresville which opened
around midnight every night except Saturday. The Mooresville Bakery, as the natives call it, was run by Mr. R.C. Powers.
Late at night, the sales counter was manned by Mr. Powers and the one and only Grim Baker.

Here, the munchies could be satisfied by hot doughnuts, cream horns, chocolate chip cookies, and brownies.

But time moves on and in the real world things change. Earlier this year Mr. Powers decided to retire. As
of July 1, 1976, Grim’s began baking under new management. Mr. Julius S. Brown, a baker from Gaffney, South Carolina
took over. Mr. Brown is a veteran baker; he also owned a bakery in Michigan before moving to South Carolina.
He learned about baking while in the navy.

The basic services of Grim’s will remain the same. Operating hours are from 11 p.m. Monday night through Saturday. The
business will be closed all day on Monday. Closing time is 6 p.m.

Mr. Brown seems optimistic about the operation of the bakery. “We already have more variety than before.” I sampled a
“new to this area” concoction called a Haystack. It was very good, sort of a cookie with coconut, raisins, and
nuts. There is also a new coke machine for those who prefer coke instead of milk and cookies. He also
mentioned that hot doughnuts would be coming out of the oven every night around 12:30 or 12:45.

Also in the near future, Mr. Brown hopes to remodel. His main idea is to enlarge the front, giving more
sales area so that perhaps a few tables and chairs could be accommodated.

Manuela Harris is his associate in the business, and she will handle the sales end.

Thus ends a chapter of a legendary Davidson character. The Grim baker may be gone, but tales of his gastronomic
delights will certainly not be forgotten.
