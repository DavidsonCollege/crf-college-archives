The men’s cross country team traveled to Rock Hill, S.C. this Saturday to compete in the Winthrop Invitational, an 8K
run.

The Wildcats placed second in the meet with 39 points, losing only to High Point University, who came up with
thirty-nine points.

The top two finishers in the race both came from High Point University, with the fastest time at 25:26. For
the ’Cats, co-captain Austin Mercadante ’06 finished in sixth place, with a time of 26:49.

Two other Wildcat harriers finished in the top ten. Jonathan Baker ’06 finished seventh with a time of 26:51 and
Lance Harden ’09 finished 10th with a time of 27:06.

Rounding out the top five Davidson finishers were Sam Morris ’08, with a time of 27:27 and Andy Kiefer ’08,
who ran the course in 27:35. They placed 14th and 17th, respectively.

Other Davidson finishers included Douglas Noreen ’07 (28:20), Alex Hoyt ’09 (28:50), James Garrett ’09 (30:36), and Andrew Hazen ’07
(31:57).

Coach Gary Andrew felt that the meet was a team effort.

“Under hot and humid conditions, the guys ran very well,” said Andrew. “One of our goals going into the meet
was to run as a pack for three miles. We mostly accomplished that. And then the guys finished well, placing
second among the seven NCAA Division I schools and second out of 19 schools overall. This was one of our
best team efforts in my 20 seasons at Davidson.”

Andrew also praised the outstanding performance of some of the top finishers.

“Austin Mercadante and Jonathan Baker led the way for the ’Cats,” he said. “Lance Harden was close behind followed by
Sam Morris and Andy Kiefer to round out our top five. [It was] a definite step forward for us.”

“It was exciting to compete in such a large and important event this early in the season,” said Mercadante.

“The times were not the fastest, but the course was more difficult than in previous years, and so I think
that our times will drop drastically in the next couple of races.”

With some time off before its next meet, the team travels to Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa., on Oct. 1
to compete at the Paul Short Run.

forced a fumble that was recovered by Alex Arinsmier ’06.

The turnover helped bring the ’Cats even closer as Smith knocked his third field goal of the night and attempt
from 31 yards, but Davidson still trailed 13-9.

After a missed field goal with 5:34 to play, Lenoir-Rhyne made good on the previous attempt with 1:45 to play
and increased their lead to 16-9.

Knowing a touchdown was the only answer and option for the ’Cats, Davidson started their potential game-tying drive on their
own 40-yard line with only 1:45 to play and no timeouts.

Converting two fourth downs on the drive, highlighted by a 24-yard completion to R. Hubbard, the ’Cats found themselves just
five yards away from overtime and a chance to win.

Hubbard sparked the ’Cats all night long as he recorded seven receptions for 106 yards, his first 100-yard receiving game.
The 12-play, 55-yard drive came up five yards short and was met with controversy as the clock read triple zeros.

“We had opportunities on both sides of the ball, but poor execution cost us some chances,” said Arinsmier.

The ’Cats, now 1-2, look to bounce back this week at Valparaiso (1-2). They will return to Valpo for the
first time since 2002 when Davidson recorded an impressive road victory.

Brett Dioguardi ’07 carries the ball in the game against Lenoir-Rhyne.

“Tom Lavan stepped forward with a dominating performance on Sunday, and they didn’t seem to have an answer for him.

Our defending also improved this weekend with two important shutouts, led by John Latting, Nahum Navas, and Will Carroll ’06,”
Spear said.

Now ranked No. 20 in the nation, the Wildcats are preparing for their next match against Old Dominion.

“They beat us last year, are extremely talented, and are ranked. It’s a huge opportunity and we aim to win
as always,” said Spear.

“We want to play each game like it’s the only one that matters, and then move on quickly. Each game,
especially those on the road, teaches us a lot, win or lose.”

The ’Cats will, however, be looking forward to getting back onto their home field.

“It adds a lot of pride to the players’ preparation and performance. Winning at home feels great,” said Spear.
