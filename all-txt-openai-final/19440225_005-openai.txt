**V-12, A-12 Test Coming Soon**
The third Army-Navy College Qualifying test for the Army Specialized and the Navy College Program: V-12, which will be given
throughout the country on Wednesday, March 15, 9:00 a.m., will be administered at Davidson, Training Program. A leaflet of general
information about the test, which contains an admission-identification form, may be obtained at Dr. P. H. Gwynn's office in Chambers.
This properly filled out form will admit students between the ages of 17 and 21, inclusive, who are high school
graduates or who will graduate by July 1, 1944. Students who intend to take the test should let Dr. Gwynn
know immediately.

The same examination will be taken by both army and navy candidates. It is designed to test the aptitude and
general knowledge required for the program of college training, and all qualified students are urged to take the test. Taking
the test does not obligate the candidate to enlist in the service.

The Army Specialized Training Program is at the college level at government expense and is entered upon after the applicant
has taken 13 weeks of army basic training. The Navy College Program also enables students to continue academic training at
government expense. Successful completion of the prescribed courses may, following further officer training, lead to a commission in the Navy.

**Rev. Morgan Speaks Here**
**Rev. F. Crossley Morgan Preached Sunday**
Reverend F. Crossley Morgan, former pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Concord, presented the sermon at vespers last Sunday
night. Dr. Morgan spoke on the story in John 8:3 of Jesus and the woman taken in adultery, which he
presented as a series of five pictures.

The first picture was of Christ going from Jerusalem to the Mount of Olives in the evening. The second shows
Jesus the next morning. The third introduces a group of scribes and Pharisees bringing a woman taken in the act
of adultery. Dr. Morgan pointed out the indecency of the Pharisees in bringing the woman at such a time and
emphasized their cleverness. “These men,” continued Dr. Morgan, “had Christ on the horns of a dilemma. If He condemned the
woman, the Roman government could arrest Him because it was forbidden to take the life of a Roman subject without
trial by a Roman court. However, if He forgave the woman, He would be violating the law of Moses. The
Pharisees saw in their question a way to ruin Him forever.”

The speaker showed that these men were themselves violating the law of Moses in not bringing the man guilty of
the adultery. He described the woman and Christ stooping in silence. In the fourth scene, Dr. Morgan showed Christ answering
the men.

C. Paratrooper Frank Caldwell Returns From Pacific

First Lieutenant Frank C. Caldwell, of Spartanburg, South Carolina and graduate of the class of 1942, visited Davidson College during
the weekend. Lieutenant Caldwell, now a paratrooper of the U.S. Marines, First Parachute Regiment, is at home on a thirty-day
leave, having recently landed in San Diego after fourteen months of action in the Pacific area. He saw action during
October and November in Vella Lavella, which is north of Munda in the New Guinea Group. He was also later
in the middle of the fighting at Bougainville. He reports that the mission at Bougainville was strictly amphibious, and that
his regiment was used in raiding parties behind Jap lines, which, he says, accounted for more than two hundred Japs.

Lieutenant Caldwell testifies to a change in the morale and fighting spirit of the Jap soldiers in recent months. His
experience leads to the opinion that they no longer have the same zealous fight-till-death spirit, which was so evident in
earlier operations. He reports that the Jap troops, however, are very well equipped, and that contrary to the opinion of
most Americans, there is a wide variety of physical proportions. He states that he has seen many Japs who are
over six feet in height and who are well proportioned in stature.

Before leaving Davidson, Lieutenant Caldwell stated that he would spend most of his 30-day leave at home, taking out for
a two-week trip to Florida. When in college, Lieutenant Caldwell was captain of the football team and a member of
the baseball nine for three years. He was vice president of the Sophomore class and later held the same office
as a Senior. He was a judge of the Court of Control, a member of Le Cercle Français, a member
of the business staff of Scripts 'n Pranks for three years, a member of the Scabbard and Blade military fraternity,
a member of O.D.K. leadership fraternity, and was selected for Who's Who Among American Colleges and Universities.
