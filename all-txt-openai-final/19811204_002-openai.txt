**APO Easter Seals Campaign**

The Davidson chapter of Alpha Phi Omega began a door-to-door campaign this week to collect donations for Easter Seals. The campaign includes both the college and Davidson community. APO members will be collecting through 12 December.

“This is one of several service projects we are working on right now,” said APO Vice President Leslie Mills. “Many APO groups have helped with Easter Seals before, but this is the first time the Davidson chapter has been asked to assist.” Leslie explains that ninety-five percent of the money collected at Davidson will go to aid handicapped children and adults in North Carolina. Anyone interested in collecting or donating should contact Leslie or APO President Jim Hooter.

Saturday, members of APO will work at Camp Dogwood, a local camp for the blind. APO member Joan Redding explains, “We will be doing certain necessary wintertime chores at the camp. We will paint chairs and take care of the general upkeep of the camp.”

APO finished its second book sale of the year today. The proceeds from the sale will be sent to support the Davidson program in Kenya.
