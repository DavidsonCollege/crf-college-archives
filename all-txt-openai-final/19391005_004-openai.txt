**Saturday in Bluefield**

Davidson goes into her third game of the season seeking her first win. Underdogs against State and Duke, the Cats
rate better this time. While the word from Lexington, Va. is not to set V.M.I. short, this time the Cats
will not face as highly rated a team as on the two preceding Saturdays. With no word at present as
to whether Shu and Shelby, the twin wreckers, will be in action, things look better for Davidson this time. Last
year at Homecoming, Messrs. Shu, Treziak, Shelby, and Co. went to town, winning by a two-touchdown margin, 19-6. But this
time we believe the story will be different, even if Shu and Shelby are in there. Early V.M.I. reports indicate
that while hurt by the loss of eight regulars via the graduation route, they will still be strong. However, in
two games thus far, the Cats have shown stern stuff, and this game should prove to be a hot one.
Somehow we believe Davidson will come through on top.

**New Intramural Field Helps**

Davidson’s latest addition to its intramural program was gladly greeted by all students. Although the new field still has many
rocks and holes on its surface, this should work off in a year or so, especially during next summer when
the grass has a chance to grow. At present, the field is bare and muddy when the weather is wet,
but everyone seems willing to overlook this since two new fields have been provided where no other teams will practice
side-by-side with the wards. The freshman field also furnishes a natural bleacher section for any spectators. These two new playing
areas, coupled with the new dormitory system, have already done much to stimulate the already active interest in intramurals. Again,
congrats to Whittle.

**Short Shots:**

The soccer team is really practicing in earnest these days. Since soccer has become a major sport in which letters
are to be given, the shinbusters are especially ready to uphold their reputation on the field. Coach Marisberger reports that
a full schedule will soon be completed. We certainly agree with other columns in this paper concerning remarks made by
Wallace Wade after the Duke-Davidson game on Davidson. Wade said that Davidson does not quit, and one would have to
go a long way to find a team that fought harder when outclassed by heavier and more experienced players. And
as to the claim that Duke’s defense was poor on that touchdown pass play, isn’t a defense always partly to
blame when a score is made? The perfect defense would never have a man blocked or decoyed out of position,
and we haven’t seen that defense as yet. Credit where it is due. Cat fans are eagerly awaiting the first
frosh game. Not much dope has come out yet about the kittens, but some of them are bound to be
varsity players in a year or two, and, as always, a school’s future teams can be largely seen in the
freshman squad. Witness loud cheers of Wake alumni since the Deaclets beat Carolina. Our pick for thriller of the week—Vandy
vs. Rice when Vandy overcame a 12-0 lead in the last 4 1/2 minutes to win on a last-play pass
by a 13-12 count.

**Cats Ready for V.M.I.**

Davidson, after making a good showing against Duke's Blue Devils on Saturday, ventures to Bluefield, West Virginia this Saturday to
take on the Flying Squadron from Virginia Military Institute. Last year, when the Cats played V.M.I. on Homecoming, they practically
had the Cadets outclassed except for the presence of the hard-charging, shifty Paul Shu, who scored all three of the
visitors’ touchdowns. This year Shu is back at V.M.I., but the Wildcats are set for him, so the annual Flying
Squadron-Wildcat meeting will be a real duel to the finish. V.M.I. opened her season by defeating a strong Roanoke College
team, but last Saturday was minus the services of Paul Shu and “Sonny” Shelby, two first-string backs who were out
with injuries. It is not known whether or not these two men will be in the game against Davidson.

**Cats Prime Aerial Guns for V.M.I. Flying Squadron**

Flankman Gales McClintock of Charlotte, ace pass receiver and a great defensive end, has played bang-up ball so far this
year. McClintock, weighing only 152 pounds, makes up what he lacks in weight with speed and determination. Gales played a
great game against Duke last Saturday.

**Intramural Highlights**

Davidson's intramural program got into full swing last week with both inter-fraternity and inter-dormitory contests being held. With the games
Monday included, the S.A.E.’s, Phi Delts, and Kappa Sigs were leading the fraternity league, each having two wins and no
losses. Duke and Rumple were on top of the dormitory race with one victory each. Wednesday, the Phi Gams defeated
the Betas 18 to 0, and the S.A.E.’s edged out the Sig Eps by the score of 6 to 0.
The Fijis scored twice on passes from Shore to McReynolds after long drives down the field. Their last score came
on a pass from Shore to Martin. The only score of the S.A.E.-S.P.E. game came in the second quarter on
a pass from Thomas to Harrison.

**K. Sigs March**

Four games were played Thursday with the Kappa Sigs swamping the N.A.’s 30 to 0, the Phi Delts nosing out
the Pi Kapps 6 to 0, the Hard Hitter.

**Conference Schedule in Full Swing**

North Carolina, Duke, and State Take Early Lead in Loop Campaign

Crushing victories over The Citadel and Wake Forest gave North Carolina’s Tar Heels an early advantage in the Southern Conference
football race as the club moved into the October lap of their campaign. The Tar Heels showed amazing power in
overwhelming the supposedly potent Deacons by a score of 32 to 0. Coupled with their total against The Citadel, this
gives the White Phantoms a total of 86 points in two games. Duke's defending champions and North Carolina State have
each had one tussle and emerged victorious. Clemson's powerful Tigers warmed up for their first Conference tilt by battling Tulane’s
Green Wave to a standstill, only to lose 7-6. The Tigers play Carolina in Charlotte Saturday. Duke meets the University
of Richmond, and North Carolina State takes on Virginia Military Institute. This week-end brings together Davidson and Washington and Lee.

**Passes Again Best Offense**

Duke's powerful Blue Devils proved superior in every department Saturday, downing a fighting Wildcat eleven 26-6. The Blue Devils rolled
up 20 first downs to the Cats’ 12 and gained a total of 334 yards. The best that the fighting
Cats could do was to complete 5 out of 12 passes for a gain of 72 yards. One of these
passes was good for a touchdown. The Blue Devils completed 12 out of 17 passes for a total gain of
134 yards.the game at Durham adds spice. This engagement will put the flashy Blue Devils to a national test. The
Dukes hope for a punting recognition, a severe try, as Pittsburgh's average is 38 yards per kick, compared with Sharpe's
40 yards per kick. Davidson's tailback, McAfee, had 38 yards per kick. Duke was penalized seven times for a loss
of 75 yards. Davidson, playing ever alert ball, did not lose a yard because of penalties.

Davidson's varsity cross country team, under the direction of Coach Whittle, has prepared for the trial which will be run
off today. With Captain Dick Gammon and P. Kellog pacing the fast harriers, things look brighter because there are about
nine men who beat last year's fifth man record. These include Captain Dick Gammon, Bob Kellogg, Brown, Green, Grier, Watts,
Washburn, and Coppedge. Coach Heath Whittle is expecting a lot from these fine-looking prospects.

After two weeks of practice, the Freshman football squad, under the direction of Coaches Little and Shepard, is beginning to
take shape and is looking forward to a successful season. With a squad of thirty young and inexperienced, but willing
and hard-working players, the coaches are molding a team that will use deception and speed to make up for what
they lack in weight. Coach Little says that the prospects are fairly good and should be better by the time
the season gets underway. Having had no tough scrimmages, it would be hard to predict anything as yet. However, Maloney,
a newcomer, is expected to see service in the backfield. The Frosh open their season against Wingate on October 12.
Blue Ridge, Duke Freshmen, Wofford Freshmen, and P. J. C. will follow on the schedule.

Duke Beats Davidson As Last Half Power Runs Up 20-6 Score

Lone Cat Marker Comes on Sharpe's Pass to Hackney in Second Quarter; Blue Devil Powerhouse Scores Decisively in Second Half

By ED LUCAS

Duke’s big Blue Devils, after being played on near even terms throughout the first half by the fighting Wildcats of
Davidson, unleashed a power attack after the intermission that netted them a 26-6 victory over the Presbyterians last Saturday on
Richardson Field. Wearing down the lighter Davidson boys in the closing quarters, Duke marched on to score its none-too-impressive victory.
The aerial-minded Cats threw quite a scare into the Rose Bowl “Dukes,” halftime rolling around with the highly favored boys
from Durham holding a slim 7-6 edge.

Davidson did Saturday in one quarter and a half what it took ten teams thirty-nine quarters, fourteen minutes, and seconds
to do last season—they scored on the Iron Dukes. It was a 25-yard bullet pass from Granny Sharpe to his
backfield mate, Claude Hackney, climaxing a 59-yard drive which accounted for the second-period tally. After battling in midfield the opening
minutes of the game, Duke started a drive on its own 28-yard line late in the first period which ended
in a score. A pass from Wes McAfee, who led the Dukes throughout the afternoon, to Bill Bailey put the
ball across. Tony Ruffa booted the extra point.

Sharpe Fires to Hackney

In the second stanza, the Devils were again on the march, but a fumble by Jap Davis and a recovery
by Davidson's ever-alert George Richmond turned the tide. A Spencer to McClintock pass...

Davidson outclassed Duke in yards gained by returns of kickoffs. Hogg's passing was the feature of the first game. He
completed three touchdowns, one pass to Sutton, and one to Means. Each score was on a forty-yard run after a
lateral from Scott. The Phi Delts were forced into an extra period before they could win on a thrilling last-minute
pass from Hunter to Downey. The Sig Eps were unable to score on the Pikas but won by virtue of
having four downs to none. Thomas made the first S.A.E. touchdown on a 15-yard run around the end. Their other
score came on a pass from Currie to Thomas, who lateraled to Hackney.

In two dormitory contests held Friday, Duke triumphed over Watts 6 to 0, and the Barracks nosed out East 6
to 0. Shelton's pass to Crihfield was the winning margin in the first game, while White's pass to Chastain on
the last play of the game won for the Barracks.

Soccer Squad Begins Drills

Under the guidance of Captain-Manager Tommy Harnsberger, the thirty candidates for the soccer team have begun intense training for the
coming season. Daily drills, outside of a lengthy practice scrimmage, include two laps around the field, a short session of
calisthenics, winding up with a drill in heading, which consists of bouncing the ball off the head and making it
go in the desired direction. Harnsberger has not yet announced the schedule for this season. However, it is expected that
an attractive schedule made up of eight or ten games will soon be published. The season will open on or
about the middle of October. One of the games may be played in Memorial Stadium in Charlotte.

Veterans back from last year include: Harnsberger, Graham Mc...
