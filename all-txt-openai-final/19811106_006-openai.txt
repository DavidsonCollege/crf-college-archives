We the undersigned, full-time students of Davidson College hereby petition the College Administration to review its policy of requiring all students to use and pay for the College Laundry Service. We further request that the Administration, after due consideration of our grievance and of the portion of the student body represented here, revise its policy and allow optional use of the said Laundry Service.

Sophomore Mahmoud Sayani posted this petition near the washing machine in the basement of Watts:

"Vice. Ve ons teens, etc.," she said. If the laundry were eliminated, students would have to buy two sets of linens, "which," she said, "are pretty expensive these days." Having the laundry also saves students time, she said.

Mahmoud's letter mentioned that the laundry often damaged his clothes. "Most student complaints have to do with shrinkage, fading, or lost items," Senior Shannon Walters recalled a pair of white painters' pants that came back "rosy pink and three sizes smaller."
