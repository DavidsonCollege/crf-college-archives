### Rats, Snakes And Broken Doors In Black Davidson College Rents Substandard Housing

By MARK WILENSKY and JOYCE STAHMANN

Copperheads, rats, cockroaches, broken windows, peeling paint, and broken doors are the identification marks of college-owned homes in black Davidson.
In addition to renting these nine houses to black staff personnel, Davidson College also provides housing for 51 faculty and
staff members in Davidson’s white section.

According to College President Samuel R. Spencer Jr. and Business Manager Robert A. Currie, “The college would like to get
out of the housing business.” Nevertheless, one tenant claims that Davidson College refuses to build a needed addition to her
three-room house, while at the same time refusing to sell the land. There are eight people in this family. “They
wouldn’t sell a piece of ground to save your life,” she said. “Sure we'd buy it if they would. Even
if they raised the rent to make the necessary improvements we wouldn’t mind.”

This resident also pointed out that there are not enough houses to go around as it is: a relative of
this family, a janitor at Davidson College, has been looking for accommodations for his family for months. “Yes, we have
a problem with rats,” the aforementioned householder admitted. “The college used to have a garbage dump right in front of
our house. When we complained about the rats, they moved it behind the house. Finally, after five or six months,
the health people came and soon after the bulldozers cleared the field. We don’t have as many rats now.”

Two hundred yards behind the house the trash pile has reappeared. The wood from the old gym floor and boxes
addressed to Davidson College are the focal point of the new dump. At the dirt road entrance to the trash
pile stands a sign: “NO DUMPING ON DAVIDSON COLLEGE PROPERTY.”

“Well, really they treat us pretty good except that we need another room or a porch,” explained the housewife, “and
the hot water heater’s very small, so we have to leave time for it to heat up between baths. Whenever
we need work done I have my husband report it, because they won’t listen to me; I don’t work for
them.”

“When the kids broke a window and we fixed it, a storm blew it in. My husband asked the college
to make repairs, and they did, but said ‘if it happens again, you'll do it yourself.’”

Other tenants living in a roomy house in another part of town said, “They don’t charge us too much to
cage.” This home on Ridge Road is rented by the College to a staff worker. The peeling paint and broken
downspout are clearly visible. In the front, the handrail leading up the steps to the door was loose and swung
from side to side.

“There’s nothing really wrong,” the man of the house said. “I just haven’t gotten around to fixing it yet.” A
lodger in yet another part of town cautioned DAVIDSONIAN staffers about walking around the house. “Yes, we have a problem
with rats. The college used to have a garbage dump right in front of our house. When we complained about
the rats, they moved it.”"It’s behind the house. We live here and we couldn’t get another house big enough, so
we don’t want to cause any trouble."

The home has broken windows, a broken screen on the front door, ratholes in the structure, and no extension cords
dangle from a light fixture in this Eden Street home. The elderly tenant must connect her washing machine to two
extension cords running from the back porch. The house is wooden-frame.

"We’ve already killed several copperheads there," the tenant said, pointing to the side of the house. "There’s a lot of
snakes around here," a little boy warned. The tenant has paid for most of the upkeep himself, including the replacement
of the linoleum.

The house is strewn with extension cords plugged into overhead light bulbs. In order to operate the washing machine, an
extension cord from the back porch had to be run into the kitchen. The four-year-old warned against standing too close
to the stove. "That stove is gonna blow up any minute."

The resident claims he is bothered by rats and roaches. Immediately to the south and west of him lie two
fields supporting dilapidated structures. Possible entry points for the pests are the front and back doors, both missing screens.

"This won’t get me in no trouble with the college, will it?" the tenant begged. "The college, they’re pretty good.
They come when I call 'em. The reason they never came out about the rats is that I never told
'em."

"I never have no problem getting the college to fix things for me," said Matty Fletcher, a renter on Eden
Street. "The house was a mess when the last boarders left, but I told them what to fix and they
fixed it. I’m very satisfied," Fletcher explained. She said that the key to getting maintenance action was in knowing how
to talk to the college authorities. "I one time had trouble getting the inside painted," she said, "but they gave
us the paint so we could do it ourselves. I got everything taken care of."

Mrs. Fletcher’s house has three broken windows and a broken screen on the door. She said that the dog ripped
the screen and she hadn’t yet reported it to the college.

In addition to the nine houses rented in the Davidson black community, the college also owns three lots where families
are living at no rent in decrepit buildings. "We’d like the people to move," said Currie, "but they have no
place to go. The college does not want to throw them out in the street."

These lots are in Brady’s Alley, on Ridge Road, and on Withers Farm. It was explained by one of the
tenants that those living on Withers Farm lived without water on the premises. Numerous windows are missing in the three
buildings, and ratholes in the walls and floor match large holes in the ceilings. The occupants on Ridge Road claimed
to be in the process of moving.

Seven of the nine rented houses sorely need painting; in addition, one of the ceilings is peeling from the inside.
The rents on these dwellings range between $3.50 and $15 a week. All tenants complained of rats and all coincided
in saying that Davidson College’s only answer to the rat problem was to suggest a dose of rat poison.
