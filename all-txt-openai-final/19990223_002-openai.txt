THE DAVIDSONIAN TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 23, 1999

On Thursday, February 18, one of the three Breath Alcohol Testing Units - BAT Mobiles - operated by the State of North Carolina visited campus as part of the Alcohol Awareness Week activities. Students who visited the bus were invited to wear one of two pairs of special goggles. The goggles simulated the effects of .08 and .16 blood alcohol levels on one’s vision. Wearing the goggles, students tried to walk a white line just as North Carolina police require motorists to do successfully in order to avoid taking the Breathalyzer test.

In North Carolina, a motorist who decides against taking a Breathalyzer test will be automatically arrested for DWI - Driving While Impaired. Also next to the bus were students offering “mocktails,” traditionally alcoholic mixed drinks without the alcohol, for bypassers to taste.

The BAT Mobile which visited Davidson was a mid-sized coach bus, and the unit’s coordinator said that it “has made nearly 1,000 arrests for DWI and close to 300 arrests of motorists under the influence of cocaine over the past calendar year.” These arrests make up only a fraction of the nearly 75,000 people arrested for DWI. Most of these arrests made by the BAT Mobile were at highway checkpoints that are frequently organized to check randomly for intoxicated motorists. In fact, a checkpoint at an undisclosed location involved the visiting BAT Mobile last Thursday evening.

In addition to helping apprehend drunk drivers, the BAT Mobiles participate in educational programs such as its visit to campus, and the training of police officers. “The State of North Carolina has some of the toughest DWI laws,” said one of the BAT Mobile’s staff. The legal blood alcohol level for driving is anything under .08%. “A motorist with a blood alcohol level of .08% or higher will be arrested and then immediately be brought before a magistrate.” North Carolina magistrates then either send drivers arrested for DWI directly to jail, let them go on bail, or order the arrested persons to appear before the court at a later date.

The presence of the BAT Mobile was part of the College’s Alcohol Awareness Week.

### From the February 1998 Archives
The campus was just beginning to consider the possibilities for a fourth eating house. PAX was expected to be the location of the fourth house. PAX, however, has continued to be a residence hall, and a new house, Turner, was built. This past Friday, February 19, 1999, the girls celebrated their first Big Sister-Little Sister night.

### February 1989
The White-Smith Scholarship was established for study and internships abroad for Davidson students. The scholarship honors Anthony White, class of 1847, and Samuel W. Smith, class of 1929.

### February 1974
The final exams for the second trimester were starting, while students made plans for spring break. The BSC president Leonard Thompson announced that the BSC would work more closely with the Union. Several members of the BSC were on...the Union Board, and Union committees were working with the BSC to plan a spring gala weekend.

On February 16, 1999, a Davidson College Presbyterian Church employee reported that boxes containing handmade products from Third World countries were missing from a locked mechanical room in the church basement. The Church intended to resell the keyrings, earrings, necklaces, baskets, and painted ornaments. An employee had valued the items at $1168.15 on January 19 during inventory. Because the room where the boxes were kept was locked and no forced entry was visible, the Campus Police believe that someone having a key committed the larceny.

On February 18, 1999, at 4:16 PM, a student living in Irwin dormitory reported that a black female was selling magazines on the first floor. An officer responded to the call and found the suspect still in Irwin. The suspect was an employee of American Community Services from Indiana. The officer issued her a trespass warrant and then escorted her off campus.

The effects of highlighted alcohol abuse at Davidson as well as raised awareness of the problem. According to Davidson Health Educator Georgia Ringle, “This year, alcohol-related problems brought to the attention of the College are down when compared to those of the previous academic year.” She then discussed the common misconception that binge drinking is prevalent on Patterson Court: “The perception that binge drinking is the popular thing to do may be attributed to the fact that often the very heavy drinkers, the students who are the binge drinkers, are also gregarious people and well known. Therefore, binge drinking may appear to some as a practice that envelops all of Patterson Court each Saturday night.” Ringle supported her comments with a report entitled “Use vs. Perceptions of Use.” The report, for which the fieldwork was done in 1997, compares Davidson to other small liberal arts colleges.
