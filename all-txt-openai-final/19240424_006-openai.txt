Wildcats Lose Two Hardfought Games To Wake Forest and State On The Road

State Wins Twelve Inning Contest on Riddick Field—Wake Forest Swamps Wildcats

The Wildcats lost an 8-0 decision to Wake Forest in the first game of their two-day trip, but gave the
Techmen a hard fight before losing 2-1 in 12 innings.

Wake Forest Game

The Davidson nine continued their losing streak by dropping an 8-0 loss to Wake Forest, April 17th, on the Baptists’
home field. The Wildcat batsmen were not able to connect with their opponents’ offerings, getting but three hits. The Wake
Forest boys, however, met Boushee's benders hard and often and piled up 7 of their 8 tallies in two innings.

The Baptists were out for blood and until after the third the Wildcats were unable to stop the onslaught. In
the opening frame two runs were chalked up for Wake Forest when Simmons singled, Greason sacrificed, Armstrong singled, stole second,
Arnette doubled, and Simmons and Armstrong scored.

Wake Forest ran wild in the third and drove Boushee from the mound. Two walks, Arnette’s second double, Edward's bingle,
and a home run by Martin accounted for five tallies. The Presbyterians tightened down behind McPherson and let the Baptists
have but one more run, that in the fifth when Edwards whanged a triple into left and romped home on
Daniels’ ballooner to center.

Frank Alford got a three-bagger in the second, but he died on the keystone sack. This was the only real
hit that left the Red and Black hickories during the whole game. The change from the home field did not
help the Wildcats to find their stride—it affected their eyes, for 10 men struck out in the five innings twirled
by Jones and six in the four by Sorrell. The line-up and summary follow:

State Game

Coach Monk's tossers lost a hard-fought 12-inning contest to the N. C. State nine, April 18th, by a 2-1 count.
The Red and Black tossers made a strong bid for victory in the eleventh, but Johnny Smith was called out
on a perfectly executed squeeze play, and the Techmen won out in the twelfth.

State drew first blood when Johnson walked in the second, took another base on a sacrifice, and scored as Holland
doubled to right. Gilbert smashed a hot one through the infield, but Vance scooped it up and threw to home,
where Holland was caught out by several feet.

The Red and Black pulled a rally in the ninth and duplicated the series of plays which had accounted for
State’s single tally. Allen passed Boushee, who advanced to second on Laird’s sacrifice; Kimbrough, playing for Simpson at second, speared
a sharp single into center and brought Boushee home.

The Wildcats set out to corner the contest in the eleventh. Johnny Smith, after being given a base, was worked
around to the third sack. Vance again saved the D. C. bacon in the second half of the ninth. One
down; Shuford singled, and Al Johnson zoomed a liner to right that seemed as if it would never stop rising.
Harry Vance at the crack of the bat had started for the fence. The ball came down in the extreme
corner of the field and came down in Harry’s trusty mitt. Shuford, having seen what looked a sure homer sail
off into the atmosphere, had already crossed the plate. Vance's throw doubled him at second.

State ended the fray in the twelfth. Gladstone and Johnston singled. Johnson filled the sacks when he beat out his
bunt. Lassiter slashed one into left and brought over the needed marker. The line-ups and summary:

VOLUNTEER BAND HEARS THREE SPEAKERS SUNDAY

D. Benton Wharton, Tom Barr, and Jack Miller made short, forceful, practical talks to the Volunteer Band on Sunday morning,
at the usual meeting of the Volunteers. Wharton, speaking first on having a purpose and sticking to it, brought out
in an original way the thought that only so far as we have in us something of Christ can we
ever do any good in the world. Education and theory have their place, but they are useless without the life
behind it. Others will learn of Christ more from what they see of Christ in us than any other way.

Jack Miller, speaking second, took the parable of the talents, and following it through showed clearly its application to campus
life. Barr, speaking last, spoke of how the watchword of the Volunteer Union could be carried out on the campus,
the watchword being "The evangelization of the world in this generation." He suggested several practical and important ways, among which
were the doing of little things that we are called on to perform, having a spirit of co-operation instead of
that of criticism with regard to conditions on the campus, and, most of all, spending time in prayer and cultivating
that, the most important as well as most neglected part of a man’s life. McAlpine presided.and the meeting proved to
be one of the most interesting held this year. Off the athletic field, Sorrells was also one of Goodykoontz, Niches
in the Wildcat Hall of Fame.

GEORGE BASCOMB (LEFTY) SORRELLS
D* Football D* Baseball

Just as one can nowhere find a higher peak of Davidson fight and spirit than that which on a November
day of 1922 held the leading claimant for South Atlantic honors, V. P. I., to a tie, just so in
that game George Bascomb Sorrells showed to all football fans that he was the cornerstone of that spirit. The score
was tied at 7-7; Virginia Tech was pushing toward the Davidson goal; after four pile-driving plunges, the ball passed over
to the Red and Black squad on the one-yard line, and it was only then that Bascomb allowed his broken
fingers to be bound up.

Bascomb began his football career at Davidson by captaining his class team, and from there to a place on the
Scrubs. He was equally at home at the guard position, and in 1922 he played regularly at that position. In
summing up his playing, the 1923 Quips and Cranks says: “He was a quick, low charger and smeared many a
play before it could gain momentum.” His specialty was on the defense, but often Bascomb was a part of the
team that moved some strong opponent out of the way for the drive of the backfield. Following his line of
development in football, Sorrells in baseball went from the Scrubs and captaincy of his class team to the position of
Varsity pitcher in the spring of 1922. His mighty build combined with his left-handed twists often proved the defeat of
another team, and the battery, Sorrells and Brice, worked just as well together in baseball as the team Sorrells and
Brice did in football. Bascomb was especially strong in the pinches, and his ability to tighten up was perhaps his
biggest asset.

Sorrells was one of the class of '23's strongest men, being president of the Senior class, active in literary society
work, and a well-known orator. George Bascomb Sorrells cut a wide path in his college course, but none ever cut
theirs deeper.

FRESHMAN CINDER SQUAD PREPARING FOR MEET

The work of the Freshmen that are out for track was held up considerably last week, but with the coming
of clear weather this week, they have had several good work-outs and are in fairly good condition. There are quite
a few men out, and some fine material has shown up in several events. The Freshmen should account well for
themselves in the meets that are to be held. While no meets have been officially scheduled thus far, plans are
being made for meets with Charlotte, Winston-Salem, and possibly Greensboro. All of the schools have good teams, and close meets
are anticipated. Winston-Salem has written Coach Younger for a meet, and it only remains to arrange a date. The meet
will more than likely be held at Davidson. Among the promising candidates that have been working for the last few
days are: Henderson, Brand, Farnsworth, Inman, Lincoln, Bohannon, Craig, Fleming, Webb, besides others.

Freshmen Prepare For Four-Game State Tour
Carolina, Wake Forest, N. C. State, and Trinity Will Furnish Opposition

The Wildkitten nine under Coach Rawson is now ready to face the real test of the season as they go
on their trip to meet four real fresh teams: Carolina, Wake Forest, N. C. State, and Trinity. The Wildkittens have
been having good work-outs and aside from a few errors, they have shown some real ability on the diamond. The
first game of the series will be at Chapel Hill where the Fresh team will meet the Tar Heel Fresh
who have easily beaten Trinity 6-2. On Saturday, the Wildkittens will vie with the Methodist yearlings at Wake Forest. So
far, the Wake Forest Fresh have only played High Schools, winning from Wendell, 22-0, and Henderson, 5-0, but losing to
Cary by the close score, 1-0. In the Cary game, Person pitching for Wake Forest, fanned 16 men. The Fresh
will face a strong pitcher if Person plays Saturday.

The Wildkittens will meet N. C. State at Raleigh on Monday, 28th. The only dope about the State Fresh tossers
is a victory over Trinity, 9-6. The last game of the series is with the Trinity Freshmen at Durham, on
the 29th. So far as comparative scores go, the Davidson Freshmen should come out on top in this game as
the Methodist pitching staff seems to be weak.
