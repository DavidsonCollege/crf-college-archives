THE DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 17, 1924

FESTIVAL AND ROMAN CIRCUS
(Continued from page 1)

The Sunday morning church service, at which special music will be an added feature, will be followed in the afternoon by the “Y” service. The closing feature of the Speaking Festival will be movies at the gymnasium on Monday night. In Search of a Thrill will be the picture in which Viola Dana will prove her merit as an actress, capping with a fitting climax the fun and jollity of youth at the Junior Speaking of 1924.

“Nothing’s too good for my boy!” What the “governor” says, goes! A Mellon outfit complete from head to toe. Everything college men wear—real college men, not the cartoon variety as pictured in the comic supplements. Suits of attractive Spring, English and American fabrics—coats on easy lines, high button, trousers fairly wide. Scotch Mist overcoats—rainproof. Soft hats, caps, heavy brogue oxfords, unusual neckwear. Everything to give a well-dressed touch to a young man’s get up. Prices moderate.

Guilford Game
Davidson received another defeat, at the hands of the Guilford nine, last Saturday on the home diamond. Guilford scored two runs in both the first and fourth innings, while the Wildcats failed to squeeze a single man across the plate. Davidson’s best bid for a score came in the sixth frame when Covington led off with the only two-bagger of the game and Johnson followed with a single. Johnson’s hit was a doubtful fly between second and center field, however, and Covington in waiting to tag up if necessary lost his chance to score. Two of Guilford’s runs came in the first inning when they got four hits out of six men up. Laird then entered the box for the Wildcats and held them scoreless for all except the fourth, when they chalked up two more counters.

N. C. State Game
The N. C. State nine handed the Wildcats a 10-1 defeat here this afternoon in a slow contest. The State nine piled up a five-run lead in the first two innings off McPherson and got to Kimbrough for four more in the sixth. When Simpson drove Sion Alford across with the Wildcats’ lone tally in the ninth he broke their string of 3 consecutive scoreless innings. Ted Covington starred at the bat for the Wildcats with two hits and two walks out of five trips to the plate. Correll and Lassiter led the State attack, Correll getting a double and a single and Lassiter a triple and a single. The Techmen scored on all three pitchers, knocking out 11 hits, having only four men left on base. Gilbert at short for State handled 10 chances without an error. Ten Wildcats were stranded on the paths. S. Alford at short knocked out two hits and scored the Wildcats’ tally. The fielding of Covington and Simpson featured for the Wildcats, both of them handling difficult chances. The Techmen made the most of every chance and played a bang-up brand of baseball, while the Wildcats lost several chances to score through inability to hit in the pinches.C. STATE.

Exchanges  
Co-Eds Flirt With Nicotine  
Brown University women of the minority group would like to have a smoking room. This followed the suggestion at the women’s student government convention at Oberlin, Ohio, of the delegate from Pembroke, that girls in her school were demanding the same. Eleven of the colleges and universities represented there had no rule against smoking, and Bernard College reported a rule permitting students to smoke.—Ex.  

If wishes were wild onions, and wild onions were dollars, Trinity would be Duke University—Trinity Chronicle.  

Another world’s record was broken when two students of the University of Iowa, Dan Gilson and Judson Large, established an endurance record by playing bridge consecutively for 25 hours. The play began at 4:00 p.m. Saturday and ended at 5:30 p.m. on Sunday.—Ex.  

A new spirit of friendliness has invaded the University of South Carolina campus with the introduction of “Hello” week. Sorority girls, college men, staid professors, and even janitors are going out of their way to say “hello,” smile and shake hands.—Ex.  

Nickel a Piece for Math Answer  
With the introduction of mercenary rewards for students of his math class for their work, Prof. Hubert Evelyn Bray and math 200 have become suddenly popular, and it is probable that Bray will have to handle at least a dozen classes next year. There is developing a heavy demand for math 200 since the monetary element was introduced into it recently by the Rice professor. It all started when Bray placed a nickel upon his desk and offered it to anyone who could identify a peculiar mathematical figure that he had drawn on the blackboard—Rice Thresher.  

Tiring of the monotonous life at the university, two Ohio State students recently set out for a few months’ adventure in other parts of the world. They took a freight to Cleveland, from where they plan to bum automobile rides to New York, and thence board a ship to some European port.—Ex.

This progressive age constantly discovers a better way of doing things—always improves—develops processes that excel. Our tailors at Fashion Park, for instance, have developed the Turole tailoring treatment—a method of making “soft” clothing possessing all the fine lines that well-groomed men demand.  

EFIRD'S  
Turole is pliant—has easy, comfortable lines—conforms to the wearer’s action or inaction—is thoroughly distinguished. The Turole tailoring treatment is available in a series of interesting style developments—we’re making a special exhibit of them now.
