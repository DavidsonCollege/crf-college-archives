### Realignment In Store

Well after last week's kidding, Bryan's analytical expertise on softball CA and YB have decided to take a quick view
into the wonderful world of IMAC volleyball, in its first year as a league setup instead of the usual tournament
procedure.

There were initially seven divisions set up with six teams comprising each division. The number of teams has been drastically
cut down lately due to the enforcement of the "2 forfeit-loser" rule by new IMAC president Bryan "Bowie Kuhn" Andrews.
Just their own fault.

As a lot of you probably know, there is not much a whole hell of a lot worse than going
to the gym at 11 to play volleyball and nobody shows. Definitely a bona fide scale of 1 to 10.

In Division 1, the Vanilla Fudge of the 4th East led by Marvin Lively, Bally McLean, Jerry Stallworth, and Doug
Suckney have blended together well enough to go 5-0. Notorious talent thieves Q12 have stuck just behind at 4-1, led
by, you guessed it, the Beach Ball and the jumping Berries.

Division 2 is spiced up by the play of the Aumquats, unbelievably good at 4-1, and the consistent team play
of the Sherwood Derbies led by A.D., Jeff Heslop, and Doug Eve.

Division 3 has the half-crazed Bonzo's Brigade rampaging through their opponents with a hearty 3-0 slate, while a full match
behind their asylum antics are the remnants of the Banging Cannoneers BCA2. They have two teams, folks, who have compiled
a highly respected 4-1 record. Miles Ward did a great job in molding this bunch of ex-frosh.

Division 4 has PUD and emerges as the almost undefeated BUA1 with a compiled 4-1 end, their only loss coming
to the always tough SPEs who, as usual, are undefeated at 5-0. Sack and Chr and Young at 4-1 are
right behind at 4-1.

In Division 5, the only decent team is Term Hurricane, led by Steve Barnes. They have a record of 5-0.
The rest are just rearranged according to the new pentathlon machine.

Meanwhile, in the number 6 division where Delt and SAE41 have forfeited their way out, the Fair Sherrill's Jewelry team
is 3-0, beating runner-up SIF 4-1 on a forfeit to give the Fair Sherrill's Jewelry team the win.

IMAC volleyball action is still going strong despite a rash of forfeits. New realignment procedures will be soon instituted by
President Bryan Andrews.

### Charlotte Football

(Continued from page 14)

Veritable Mecca of the sports world. Instead, we have the Checkers and sometimes the Cougars. Big time for sure!

Maybe it’s selfish of me, but somehow I can't imagine Csonka, Kiick, and Warfield with "Charlotte" across their chests. Kind
of like Frank Sinatra playing the Rathskeller.

We salute Bill Reed as the new Davidson Wildcat and bid Dave Bender a fond farewell. He has been an
institution in himself for three years.

Also, why a female mascot? Is that not tokenism at its worst? There are thousands of coed schools across the
nation, but only Davidson was so bush as to invent a Miss Kitty. How about one mascot, either male or
female?

And another thing - why not present Bender with the Wildcat head he’s now worn for three years? It is
beat up and needs to be replaced anyway. The cost of replacing it is slim indeed when compared to the
amount of free publicity and spirit Dave brought to Davidson.

Bender followed the team (often at his own expense) around the country, giving up vacations, study time, and free time.
Never has a Davidson athlete done more.

### IMAC REPORT

For Volleyball

The enforcement of the "2 forfeit-loser" rule by new IMAC president Bryan "Bowie Kuhn" Andrews has led to a lot
of teams making ungracious exits from the nets.

In Division 1, the Vanilla Fudge of the 4th East led by Marvin Lively, Bally McLean, Jerry Stallworth, and Doug
Suckney have blended together well enough to go 5-0. Notorious talent thieves Q12 have stuck just behind at 4-1, led
