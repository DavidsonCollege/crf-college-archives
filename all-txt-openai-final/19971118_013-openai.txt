THE DAVIDSONIAN

Wildcats’ season of heartbreak
By Michael J. Kruse

Say this for coach Tim Landis and his Wildcat gridders: One thing they don’t lack is consistency. When they win,
they win big — 41-25 over Maryville, 42-14 over Sewanee, and 43-0 over Hampden-Sydney — but when they lose, they
do so in excruciating fashion and they do it in the fourth quarter — or, as it turned out this
week, overtime.

The football team lost its seventh game Saturday at Richardson Field, posting a 10-0 lead in the first quarter and
then stumbling the rest of the way en route to a disheartening 13-10 OT defeat at the hands of an
upstart Bridgewater squad.

“We didn’t execute,” Landis said in a somber press box. “And we weren't doing a whole lot on offense.” At
least not after the first 15 minutes.

The Wildcats got on the board with 6:46 left in the opening quarter, as Brian Langley booted a career-best 38-yard
field goal to give Davidson an early 3-0 lead. And with 1:43 left in the period, the Wildcats upped their
advantage to 10-0 on a 30-yard touchdown pass from Tommy Dugan to fullback Eric Ferguson. It was Dugan’s eighth scoring
toss of the fall, as the Wildcat signal-caller hit Ferguson in stride on a beautifully thrown ball.

After that, though, it was all Eagles, as the Wildcats blundered their way to an anemic 24 yards and four
first downs in the second half. Bridgewater (2-8) finally broke its scoreless drought with 10:17 to go in the game
when Michael Padgett split the uprights with an ugly but effective 20-yard field goal. Padgett’s three-pointer was set up four
plays earlier on a 52-yard bomb from Bridgewater quarterback Brith Osinkosky to wide receiver Robert Ziegenfuss.

On the ensuing Davidson drive, Shaun Tyrance — who replaced starter Tommy Dugan at quarterback midway through the third period
in an effort by Landis to jumpstart the stagnant offense — fumbled on a crushing sack by the Eagle defense.
Bridgewater’s offense took advantage of the turnover, putting together a five-play, 13-yard touchdown drive. Marcus Webb took it in from
two yards out and Padgett’s extra point knotted the game with 6:48 remaining.

In overtime, the Eagles struck first on a booming 37-yard Padgett field goal. Davidson’s possession, an ineffective three-and-out, resulted in
a missed 43-yard attempt by Langley — and the Wildcats’ seventh loss in 10 tries this fall.

“It’s difficult because I felt like we had control of this game,” Landis said. “I thought we could keep plugging
away and get a score in the third quarter. We really needed to come out of there with 17 or
20 points. We just didn’t get it done.”

“For our kids to do this on the road like that, I’m just so grateful,” Bridgewater coach Michael Clark said.
“I challenged them (at halftime). I’m just grateful they responded. For a lot of reasons and for a lot of
people, this was a great game.” But not for anyone on the Davidson side of the field, as the Wildcats’
season of heartbreak continued.

S. Fla. an unprecedented challenge

Now is no time to pout for the tough-luck football team. Division I-AA non-scholarship South Florida looms. The Wildcats will
face the Bulls — looking to conclude their inaugural season on the gridiron with a win — in Saturday’s season
finale at 7:00 p.m. in Tampa’s Houlihan’s Stadium.

Football Notebook

South Florida’s 87-player roster includes 54 freshmen, 15 sophomores, 15 juniors, and three seniors. Seventeen of those first-year collegiates turned
down at least one Division I-A scholarship offer. Among the veterans, there are 10 transfers from Division I-A programs. Brett
Avery came to USF from Rutgers, Chad Barnhardt from South Carolina, Kevin Bouis and Trevor Hypolite from Kentucky, Glenn Davis
from Purdue, Keith Williams from Memphis, Brian McNulty from Michigan St., and Clif Dell and Brian Erb from Florida St.

“They’re good, real good,” Wildcat coach Tim Landis said after Saturday’s loss. “They’re the best team we play this season
by far.”

While Davidson’s chances of closing the season with a win are slim to none — and probably closer to none
than slim — the game will still represent an opportunity for the Wildcats to create a sort of bowl-game-like atmosphere
on a fun-in-the-sun trip. Also, the crowd will certainly be the largest for a Davidson football game this season —
and probably in decades. South Florida sold 17,000 season tickets before its 1997 campaign ever began. Houlihan’s Stadium, which seats
up to 74,000 for the NFL Tampa Bay Bucs’ games, has a capacity of 46,500 for USF contests.

“We'll go down there and play our hearts out,” Landis said.

Sapp stars in home finale

Senior wide receiver Eric Sapp finished his home career with a stellar effort, pacing the Wildcats’ receiving corps with three
catches for 44 yards. “He’s had a great year,” Landis said. “It’s been tremendous for him because he played very
little his first three years. He’s not the fastest guy out there, not the strongest guy out there, but he’s
got a big heart.”

Saturday's game marked the final home game for Davidson’s 12 seniors. Middle linebacker Shreve Ariail, fullback Ellis Boyle, defensive tackle
Brian Brown, offensive lineman Brian Cowan, offensive lineman Mike Cowles, defensive tackle Ryan Gist, linebacker Chris Hess, offensive lineman Joe
Mahoney, cornerback Sandy Neblett, Sapp, center Chip Stewart,and defensive lineman Marcus Williams were all honored in a pregame ceremony... Wildcat
punter Jeremiah Parvin, who has averaged 38.5 yards a kick in this, his rookie season, unleashed a career-best 59-yarder with
approximately 13 minutes left in the second quarter that literally died on the Bridgewater one-inch line... Saturday’s leading tacklers for
the Wildcats: Ariail with a dozen, safety Chad Wright and Hess each with 10, and rookie standout Bo Henderson with
9. Wright had Davidson’s only interception.

Oh so close
The Wildcats’ seven losses have been by 14, three, 10, three, seven, five, and three points. That’s an average margin
of defeat of 6.4 points. Four of those losses, not including the OT loss to the Eagles, have come in
the final 1:26... Saturday’s 13-10 loss to Bridgewater represented the first overtime affair in the 100-year history of Davidson football.
The NCAA instituted the no-tie rule two years ago... Going into Saturday’s contest, junior tailback Lorenzo Moll stood seventh on
Davidson’s all-time rushing chart with 1,420 yards on 341 attempts. Moll gained only five yards on six rushes versus the
Eagles... Fullback Eric Ferguson, with 23 yards on seven carries Saturday, moved into 10th place in the Wildcat rushing annals.
The star sophomore from Maggie Valley, N.C., dubbed early in his career as the “Maggie Valley Monster” by Davidson Radio
Network play-by-play man Frank Santore, now has 1,146 yards on 239 rushes... Quarterback Tommy Dugan is fourth on the passing
list. The redshirt junior entered Saturday with 3,584 aerial yards, having completed 275 of 557 passes in his Davidson career...
Quote of the week: Landis as he left the press box Saturday afternoon: “OK, I’m going to go hit my
head against a wall for a little bit.”

There was nothing snake-bitten about this loss. It was a game the Wildcats clearly should have won, but lost because
of their own inadequacies, not some football god who has a personal vendetta against them. After utterly dominating the first
quarter, the Wildcats went into a debilitating funk from there on out, gaining an embarrassing 24 yards in the second
half while watching Bridgewater inexplicably tie the game at 10 in the fourth quarter and then use overtime to earn
only its second victory of the season.

Quarterback Tommy Dugan, who generally made good decisions in the passing game Saturday, released a handful of ill-advised pitches running
the option. Overall, Davidson fumbled the ball seven times, losing just two of them due to several fortunate bounces.

“We've been running the option for four years,” Landis said, “and I don’t remember ever having five or six balls
on the ground like that.”

The Wildcats also committed a dozen penalties that cost them 94 yards. A holding infraction killed Davidson's last drive in
regulation and a false start penalty in overtime extended Brian Langley’s game-tying field goal try from 37 yards to 42
yards — an important five yards considering Langley’s 38-yarder in the first quarter barely made it over the crossbar.

“If we don’t have that five-yard penalty, the ball probably goes through,” Landis admitted. “We’re not good enough to come
out and make those kinds of mistakes.”

The type of which there were many Saturday.

“We just let one slip away,” Landis said.
