#### Lecturer talks on African-Americans in Modern Art

By Jonathan Brooks

Winslow Homer is frequently associated with the paintings of an idealistic, nineteenth-century America, seascapes, and carefree childhood experiences. Duke University history professor Peter Wood brought light to another subject which Homer chose to depict: African-Americans after the emancipation of slavery in 1863. Wood, the Ken Kelley lecturer for this semester, proceeded to give an informative talk on the impact of the emancipation on African-Americans as portrayed in art.

Professor Wood began the lecture with a discussion of Homer’s 1899 painting *The Gulf Stream*, in which an African-American is seen drifting on a boat surrounded by sharks in the ocean. Wood expressed that in order to fully understand Homer’s treatment of the African-American in this work, it is necessary to follow the development of Homer’s portrayal of blacks in his other paintings.

Homer, who was also an illustrator for *Harper’s Weekly*, portrayed the situation of blacks during and after the Civil War in his illustrations for this publication and in his paintings. In his painting of a decaying Mt. Vernon (which was often seen as an emblem of the nation), Homer presented an allegorical painting, according to Wood, as evidenced by Homer’s depiction of an African-American family, emerging from the basement into the bright daylight, with their backs to the south, facing north toward their freedom.

Professor Wood also noted that while many of Homer’s contemporaries portrayed African-Americans disparagingly, Homer courageously faced the problems of blacks in his paintings. Many painters continued to glorify southern traditions and portrayed blacks in complete subservience. Wood said that Homer, on the other hand, chose to confront issues that arose for the freed blacks after the Civil War. For example, education, labor, and political relations were some of the important themes addressed by the artist in his works.

At the end of the lecture, Wood returned to the painting of *The Gulf Stream* and stated that “Homer had come to that painting with a lifetime of experience.” Homer witnessed the Civil War, the emancipation of slaves, and the Reconstruction era, and he brought all of these experiences to light in his painting.

With this in mind, this particular painting illustrated the condition of all African-Americans in 1899. After witnessing the Reconstruction and the implementation of segregative laws, Homer in this painting alluded to the desperate situation of blacks at the turn of the century.

Like the figure in the artist’s painting, African-Americans were free to explore the open sea but were met by hostile sharks.

#### Senior studio art major displays last exhibit

Ed Theideman's art exhibit went up in the Smith Gallery Sunday, April 24. Theideman, influenced by Robert Motherwell and Adolf Gottlieb, primarily works with acrylic and charcoal, but does not want to be confined to any one medium or theme. When asked about continuing with his art after college, Theideman said, "I still consider myself a student. I want to keep learning. When you stop learning, you stop living."
