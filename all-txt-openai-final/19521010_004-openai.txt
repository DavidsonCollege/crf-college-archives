Korean War, emphasis was placed on the correction of the bad habits of waste and carelessness by training in supply
economy. Korea gave evidence of how this training was effective in a decrease in unnecessary loss of material. The supply
economy and cost-conscious training is now part of the program of instruction for ROTC units. The objective of the training
is the development of a sense of cost-consciousness in the cadet. He is taught to realize that supply discipline is
in reality a command responsibility. Supply discipline is achieved through proper application of leadership techniques and is an important phase
of small unit training. The training covers the entire four years of the ROTC course. It begins in MS I,
stressing the individual’s responsibility for his own equipment and develops into the command responsibility phase in MS IV. Today, the
Army places much importance on an officer's economical use of supplies and equipment under his control. The officer's efficiency report
contains a section where entries are made relative to his efficiency in supply economy.

Here in the Davidson Corps of Cadets, Cadet Major Brown W. Dennis (S-3), and Cadet Major James W. Jervey (S-4),
will assist the regimental commander in the training in and execution of supply discipline. The goal set for the corps
this year is no loss or damage to a single piece of equipment. One hundred per cent achievement means the
saving of money for Davidson College and the individual cadet.

This year the names of freshmen convicted by the Court of Control will appear in The Davidsonian, together with their
charges and penalties. Freshman offenders listed this week will not becharged by the court in chapel before the student body.
Below is a list of those tried by the court last Monday night. Bob Robinson, Charley Curry, Corky Burdette, Ken
Bumgarner, R.W. Buchanan, and G.G. Dimijan were found guilty of wearing no name plates. They were ordered to wear large
signs giving their names, to take quizzes on the Freshman Regulations, and were assigned to upperclassmen for “stud boys,” to
shine shoes, etc. Fred Myers, found without a hat in chapel, was made “stud boy” for an upperclassman; Jeff Smith,
no hat, no name plate, was ordered to wear a large name card and a ribbon on his cap, and
to assist the cheerleaders at the State football game. Tom Tennent and John Young, found guilty of lending beanies during
chapel hat check, were assigned to The Davidsonian for work and were ordered to wear ribbons on their caps for
two weeks. Buddy Whitlock and Tommy Jordan were convicted of raising a disturbance between dormitories and displaying ungentlemanly conduct at
a high school football game. They were sentenced to take a quiz, wear large name signs, be “stud boys,” and
appear before the court at its next meeting.
