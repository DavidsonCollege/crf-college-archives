Life is a train of moods like a string of beads, and, as we pass through them, they prove to
be many-colored lenses which paint the world their own hue, and each shows only what lies in its focus. —
Emerson.

CAMPUS BIG BEN
Any campus improvement deserves the wholehearted appreciation of the student body, and the new clock on the north end of
Chambers certainly falls in that category. The big watchful face of the timepiece by all means lends something to the
bare brick of the rear end of Chambers. Our thanks to the class of '36 for their gift, not just
another gift, but a decided improvement to the campus. Thanks also to the College for installing the huge timepiece. Murmurs
a weary freshman, “If it only had an alarm!”

DAY STUDENTS
It seems that one of the saddest deficiencies in college life at Davidson is the failure on the part of
day students to take an active part in student affairs. Perhaps it is because they lack organization. At almost every
other college in the country, one may find a well-established organization of day students, possibly with at least one representative
in the student government. Since students at Davidson should be proud of the famous “Wildcat Spirit” which is displayed in
everyday life as well as in athletics, it seems that something should be done to form a closer bond between
the day students and the rest of the student body.

LIFE OF SERVICE
With the conclusion of this academic year, one member of the faculty completes his twenty-fifth and final year of a
most successful teaching career. Although his work as an instructor is finished, his life of service will still live on.
That man is Dr. Howard Bell Arbuckle, head of the Chemistry Department. No faculty member on the Davidson campus commands
more respect or love than Dr. Arbuckle. As a teacher, he has been patient, understanding, and helpful to his many
students. The fact that he was named one of the two most popular professors on the campus, expressed adequately his
ability as a teacher.

As a scholar and leader, Dr. Arbuckle excels. A Phi Beta Kappa and ODK key bear mute but evident testimony
of this fact. His name stands out prominently among those few names of Davidson men listed in Who's Who In
America. Nor has his scholarship been of a mere theoretical type. Far from that, it has extended, driven by a
boundless energy, into the most practical realms of science, always toward advancement and aiding of others. A warm smile, a
hearty laugh, and a good story for every occasion typify his boyish personality. Dr. Arbuckle, affectionately known as “Coffee,” has
never been known to teach an uninteresting class in his life. Many are the students who have been inspired by
his work and experience as a chemist to enter the field as their own life work. And when a man
makes others live as he himself does, that man has an indefinable, an intangible thing called personality, and one of
the greatest sort.

Though Dr. Arbuckle may cease his endeavors as an instructor of chemistry, his interests and service in religious work will
go on. As the father of the present Davidson College “Y,” Dr. Arbuckle has worked with the Board of Control
for twenty-five years, and even now, he will continue to act with that group. However, Dr. Arbuckle’s busy endeavor in
a busy world has never eclipsed a truly fine Christian life. In every angle and slant of his life, his
religion has never been slighted. And modestly, Dr. Arbuckle attributes anything he might be to his wife. And rightfully enough
in many ways, for it has often been said that a man’s character can be told by the type of
wife he picks. In the words of the Class of '36 Quips and Cranks, in the dedication to Dr. Arbuckle:
“Both by the instruction he gave in the classroom and by the example he set as a Christian gentleman, he
has constantly been a help and inspiration to us. The academic instruction we may soon forget but the memory of
his fine life, his sympathetic and willing helpfulness, and his deep understanding of our problems, will remain with us for
many years.”

Campus Comments
I plan to write a few words on a controversial subject, not because it is controversial, but because it is
important. For in a certain way this year, as never before, the Davidson dances have been put on a big-time
basis, with outstanding orchestras and with forceful publicity among the students and in the newspapers. Perhaps this is the critical
time when we should rethink the whole problem of Davidson dances and ascertain just what is their status.

There are many phases of the problem which I would not care to discuss, but there is one thing in
particular that I would like to mention, and that near the close of the article. But first, as to our
attitude.

To Those of You Who Dance:
You have recreation which you have followed, some arising from the dance itself, others from the attendant circumstances. With the
former all cause for the latter, if you are really interested in putting dancing on as high a plane as
possible, and I take it that you are.

To Those of You Who Do Not Dance:
You have found dancing to be contrary to your convictions; there are features about it to which you conscientiously object.
Hence, you consider it wrong to dance. Your desire and policy, despite all your antagonistic attitudes toward dancing, and despite
all your fervent and deep-rooted desires for dancing to be abolished, it is quite evident that your manifest contribution has
been small.

Despite all your antagonistic attitudes, you must realize that there are many bitter criticisms against this form of recreation which

18-19 Top of the Town— Another one of the year’s biggest musical hits that should not be missed. Hugh Herbert,
Doris Nolan, and George Murphy take the leading parts in this picture of beautiful dance numbers and outstanding scenery. Lard

since art is not Art. Jack Branch, Salty, Tricky Dave, and Jelly to Concord for Sweet Briar sendoff. And Salty
still has vacation hair. Fatty Armfield the popcorn vendor. Rev. Cooper's congregation pulled a sitdown strike. Who was the pug
in the Tavern wanting to take on all of Davidson two at a time? Addenda: Is Fishface Malone a man
or a mouth? Carl Carlson was the Monk from Siberia whipping around in that smooth blue “job” Herm the Fath
ad. Henry Lyon, Phil Friberg, Jerry Harris, and Speedy Turner breakfasting on the Catawba. Ken Darby, Tom Finlay, Dick Winters,
and Indian Joe Lauck got as far as Charlotte on their trip to the Derby. Chivy Chivy ... everything except
Storme and the seven veils at the Bowery. Mac Covington and Mokey Faison hideosities. Darkeyes had a cold and now
all the Phi Gams are sniffling. Salty’s unique studs. Aren't women wonderful? Unhappy Lilith was the daddy, mac de tiger,

To The Editor From An Ex-Editor

“Staff Elections” An editorial in the fifth issue of The Davidsonian entitled “Staff Elections” attracted my particular attention, simply because
I find myself unable to enthusiastically agree with the attitude of its eminent author, despite an intimate appreciation of his
views, but also because of a striking contrast it bears to other items on the same page. This contrast goes
without amplification, so I shall confine myself here to an attempted vindication of a disagreeable stand on the five reasons
listed as the most outstanding ones for changing the method of electing editors to the various campus publications.

The first two of these I shall like to answer jointly. The writer states (1) “the editorship of a publication
is by nature a technical position. (2) “The staff of a publication is more competent to know the qualifications necessary
for an editor and to judge which member of the staff has these necessary qualifications.” Those statements sound quite logical
on the face, but behind the scene one sees a very different picture. The editor of any publication on the
campus requires little time to sense the feeling that his job is not one of simply getting together his material
and fulfilling a technical routine, but that he is in an intangible relation with his fellow students, the faculty, and
alumni of the college. He must be a leader, with ideas for progress and improvement. So if he is to
serve the student body representing THEM in his capacity as editor, the student group knows best who can meet these
intangible problems.

In the third place we read, "Staff elections shift the emphasis from popularity or political backing as the primary qualifications
for editorship to journalistic ability and service to the publication." Readily I concede the point that popularity is a large
factor in electing editors at Davidson, but it is subordinate to my argument. A popular man on the Davidson campus
is in most cases one who has leadership qualities and furthermore they are qualities steeped in sincerity and a desire
to serve. A desire to serve not an inanimate thing like a publication, as the editorialist points out, but a
desire to serve the men, for whom he has been chosen to serve through this publication, or through the Y.
M. C. A. or through the student council, in the administration of student government as would be the case with
the student body president. Why not have the president of the student body elected by the student council from a
junior representative on that group, or the Y. M. C. A. president from a member of the “Y” cabinet?

A fourth reason is advanced by the “Ex-Staffer.” “For the reasons above,” he says, “underclassmen members of the staff would
tend to work hard, realizing that they will be graded on the work and ability rather than the opinion of
a group unfamiliar with and in a large measure uninterested in their efforts.” Ask yourself this question, and then think
for a few moments to determine what your attitude toward it would be as a student on Davidson's campus. Is
a student, by nature, more interested in working untiringly toward attaining a position on the campus that is unquestionably backed
by the support of the honored and respected opinion of a majority of his fellow students, or is he more
interested in becoming highly technically (Continued on Page 6)

generally regaled the Davidson campus. Is a student, By J. T. MORTON

COUNTRYMAN

A God made the tillers of the soil, with their characteristic stooped shoulders, worried brow, and scrawny hands. He made
the yokels, clod-knockers, hicks, rubes, louts, to steady the nerves of flustered nations and feed our famished lands. Unpolished he
stands, the emblem of fidelity. Uneducated too perhaps, yet he ponders the problems of life with the shrewdness of a
Grecian philosopher. Through trailing clouds of glory, he sits and views the naughty world go by, secure with seasoning. The
jar-flung fad of unionization has seeped through every class of humanity except the obscure farming element of our country. The
individualistic countryman continues to milk Old Molly seven days a week without necessitating a sit-down strike. He still ploughs the
turf nine hours a day without punching stop-clocks on each turn of the row. The quiet serenity of the verdant
countryside in spring is like a painted picture with its studied calm, broken with the occasional mooing of cows, chirping
of crickets, the cooing of turtle doves. A wistful flower gently beckons its head with the breeze, while the dainty
petals flutter to the green. These magical traits of Mother Nature fashion the honest and conservative countryman, “the backbone of
our nation.”

BUMMERS BENCH with plush cushions, trim back and two signaling flags would be a unique and fashionable Senior gift for
the Centennial Class. It would be located at the thumbing corner. We'll tag it “The Bummer's Paradise.” Imagine the benefits—no
arm calisthenics, swollen feet, and thumb dislocations! Then too, Davidson College could enumerate it with the other pioneering achievements.

Davidson's student prize-loafer is Pinky Puss Mills. Persistent Georgia porch sitter on sunny afternoons. Flounders around Efird’s Charlotte store and
plans to establish perennial interest in the concern. Slumbers en masse the noon and night. Not of hoi polloi of
Greenville, S.C. but grower of gardenias, groomer of Buicks. Mediocre sartorial connoisseur, in conservative coat and genteel cravat. Excitable squeaky
voice when tortured by his Hotel Georgia Arms denizens. Beaming countenance slit by friendly slouchy smile and topped by toupee
of dirty yellow interspersed with sprangling gold. Aimlessly shuffles along with padded position, secretary et cetera included in cotton mill
set-up back home. Blushes in profusion when the butt of friendly jests. Corn-husker Carlson, the boy with the flustered countenance.
Rumor is that he is a Bolshevik. Dansant lover, and listed with Greensboro’s upper “SOL.” Like the other Briarhopper Boys,
he is of Swedish ancestry. Quibbles with Yates Faison on problems of life. Opinion: Believes himself to be better looking
than Ed Armfield, but can't prove it. Worried because best Greensboro girl stated that he was ugly. The ugly duckling!
Expert twirler of the racket. Road House fan on Sunday nights, where he sips the breath of spring. Recommended to
be chief muleteer for Centennial pageant.

A new gymnasium for Davidson High School will be built in the very near future.

Davidson High School will graduate thirty seniors at the commencement exercises on May 25.
