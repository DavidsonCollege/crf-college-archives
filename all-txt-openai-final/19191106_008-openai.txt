ALUMNI BANQUET.
(Continued from page 1)

Mr. Mclver, '88, was gratified to see that, although football had changed since he starred on a Davidson eleven, the teams were still upholding the prehistoric traditions of the college. It became necessary for so many of the married men to journey home and so many bachelors had to journey elsewhere that the festivities had to be cut short. Nothing can do more for Davidson College than such a gathering as was held that night. Every man went away feeling that Davidson was the best college in the world and thanking his stars it was his privilege to go there. Too much praise cannot be given Mr. Askew and the loyal alumni of Atlanta for arranging these annual banquets and perpetuating the spirit which has placed Davidson in the position she occupies today.

Those present from the different classes were: 1888, D. M. Mclver; 1898, W. G. Perry; 1900, H. M. Askew, J. A. Winn; 1903, H. H. Caldwell, W. M. Duon; 1904, R. G. McAliley; 1905, J. S. Grey; 1906, B. R. Lacy; 1907, Scott Candler; 1909, Charles Taylor; 1914, H. S. Caldwell, J. R. McGregor, M. A. Candler; 1915,Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

STUDENTS ATTENDING OXFORD SCHOLARSHIP COMMITTEE MEETING

Committees of Oxford graduates have been meeting in every state to pass on applications for the Rhodes scholarships. The successful candidates will be those whom the committees think to be the best all-round. The applicants all had to appear for a personal examination before these committees. Davidson was represented in five states by six of her best students. There was thought, however, to be little chance of any undergraduate getting an appointment since most of the applicants already had a college degree. From Davidson, Askew went to meet the Georgia committee at Atlanta. O. P. Hart and Louis Schenk met the North Carolina committee at Raleigh. J. R. McKeldin went to Nashville, Tenn.; J. E. Cassell went to Charlottesville, Va., and L. P. Good went to Columbia, S. C., to meet the committees of their respective states. The successful candidates for the scholarships will be announced soon by the Associated Press.
