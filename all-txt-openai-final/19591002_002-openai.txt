THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

**They Said It Couldn't Be Done**

If our recent visitor Mr. Khrushchev had come to Davidson and approached a member of the Class of '63—as he
surely would, due to the red beanies—with the request to “take me to your leader” he would more than likely
not have been taken to Mr. Martin’s office. The freshman would rather have tipped his red hat and taken Mr.
K straight to Court of Control Judge Milton Gee.

Members of the upper three classes can hardly do more than stand in open-mouthed awe as they watch Court Judge
Milton Gee weld the Class of '63 into a body solidly behind him and the Court. This reaction is understandable;
everyone was expecting the traditional “Hate Gee” chants from the frosh. We can’t remember a judge who wasn’t sneered and
jeered at. The applause and cries of “There's our leader!” as a Judge returns from recovering a freshman cap mark
a new day, we think, in the Court of Control.

Even more of a tribute is the fact that it is Gee who is largely responsible for the recent upturn
of school spirit. Acting in conjunction with several members of the upper classes, it was Gee who engineered and executed
the pep rally and bonfire last Friday night. We seniors had never seen a Davidson pep rally before, nor can
we remember giving whole-hearted support to the football team on a Saturday afternoon. The proverbial shot in the arm has
been administered, and the ball has started rolling. All we can hope is that it has enough momentum to keep
rolling and gain speed. With the Court and the Class of '63 pushing, we think we have a good case.

**"Bigotry"... Or Self-Preservation**

“The New York Times gave page one display to the shooting in Puerto Rican gang ambush of a Bronx schoolboy.
In deadpan style The Times reported that “the killing was the first since school opened last week; six other juveniles
died this summer in attacks on the city’s streets.”

Commenting on the protest of parents in Glendale, another section of New York City where Negro and Puerto Rican pupils
are being transferred in an effort to integrate schools, The New York Herald Tribune said in an editorial that the
parents’ behavior was “shameful... intolerable... an ugly thing... turning an eight, nine or ten-year-old child into a tool of bigotry.”

Some parents are peculiar enough to risk bigotry in the hope of preserving life in their children.”

**An Opportunity To Learn**

The “Book of the Semester Program” is gaining steam as the date for the arrival of Vance Packard draws near.
Tommy Colvin and cohorts have been in seclusion for the last several weeks attending to the details of the visit
of our important guest on October 21.

Already, Colvin reports, approximately two hundred of the seven hundred copies of “The Status Seekers” ordered have been purchased and
the drive to sell them to interested alumni and other patrons of the college has just been launched. Also, plans
have been formulated to secure a panel of distinguished men from Charlotte and surrounding localities to question Packard on his
views. If this part of the program is successfully arranged, it should add much to his visit.

The Reverend Frank Hall has agreed to devote his Vesper’s sermon the Sunday evening before Packard arrives to the problems
of status seeking. Plans have also been laid to have various professors familiarize themselves with the work so as to
be able to lead student discussions on the topic. To add spice to the occasion, a bus may be chartered
to bring interested status seekers from our sister institution, Queens College.

As anyone can see, a lot of hard work has gone into this project. It needs just one more thing—student
support. One doesn’t need an editorial writer to tell him that nothing can succeed on this campus, or any other
for that matter, unless it has the students behind it. The DAVIDSONIAN urges that the students and faculty read the
book and support the program. A little enthusiastic support never hurt anybody. Besides, we might learn something.

**Big Dividends**

A Swedish journalist who visited the campus this week was impressed most not by the fine physical plant or the
highly reputed Davidson faculty, but by a tradition. All too often we forget the importance of the little everyday things
that are so important to the Davidson way of life.

The visitor was most impressed by the friendliness and cordiality of the students. So impressed was he that he remarked
that this is the kind of Americana that Chairman Khrushchev should have been shown. “It is so warm and friendly
here,” he remarked. It seemed a bit funny that he should be so impressed, but his reaction was typical. The
next time you see a stranger on campus be extra friendly. Show him that he is welcome. He may be
an alumnus, the father of a student—or Mr. Dana.

**HOW GOOD IS TOO GOOD?**

**Is Davidson Too Hard To Get Into? Facts Say “No”**

By ERVIN DUGGAN Davidsonian Managing Editor

Is it too hard to get into Davidson College?

Faculty and administration officials this week answered a resounding “No!” in the face of growing criticism from alumni, would-be applicants,
and athletic department officials.

“We're right at the top in the South,” said Assistant Dean H. Edmunds White this week, “But we've still got
a long way to go before we’re at the top of the heap.”

Davidson students, consistently chalking up the highest college board scores in the southeast, still cannot compete with the established eastern
schools, he said. This year, he reported, ten per cent of Davidson's freshmen were turned down by other schools—some by
more than one college.

“Most of the schools which rejected present Davidson students were Ivy League schools,” White said. “Rice Institute in Texas is
the only southern college which rejected a Davidson applicant. But Williams, Princeton, Yale, Dartmouth, Amherst, Oberlin, the service academies and
some others all turned down one or more applicants who are now students at Davidson.”

**INTELLECTUAL HAVEN?**

The figures released by White tended to alter somewhat the image, created by detractors of the college admissions committee, of
Davidson as a haven for intellectuals of the genius category only.

The admissions committee has met widespread criticism recently concerning the difficulty of gaining admission for top athletes, alumni sons and
sons of possible donors to the college. White stressed that the search of the admissions committee for top-quality academic prospects
in no way implied that the consideration of extracurricular and athletic achievement was neglected, as widespread rumors concerning the admissions
policy have intimated.

According to statistics concerning college board entrance examination scores, Davidson students score higher than any other leading schools in the
South. Last year’s test scores indicate that Davidson stands at the top among southern schools, but is considerably below many
northern and western schools.

**DAVIDSON I.Q.: 120**

Just what are the capabilities of Davidson students as indicated by entrance test scores and high school records? Figures from
the college testing center and the registrar’s office indicate that Davidson is admitting above average students—but few so brilliant as
to discourage “normal” candidates from applying for admissions.

“The mid-score on the college board tests at Davidson is somewhere between 550 and 570," said Professor Jay Ostwalt. “This
is well above the national average, which is about 450.” Ostwalt estimated the median Davidson I.Q. at “around 120,” a
score considered in the “superior” category by testing experts.

He stated that the high school average of Davidson applicants averaged about 93 this year: “somewhat higher than that in
past years.” The class of 1960 had a high-school average of 91.5; that of the class of 1961 was 90.5.

**TOP MEN OF ‘63**

Forty students in theclass of 1963—about twenty per cent of the class—were valedictorians, salutatorians, third or fourth ranking students in
their respective classes, according to college registrar F. W. Hengeveld. Three students this year achieved scores in the near-perfect percentiles
on the mathematics division of the College Board tests, reporting scores above 750 of a possible 800. Eleven students admitted
by the college reported scores below the national average on one category, but Hengeveld stressed that no students are admitted
whose low scores in one category are not brought up to an acceptable level by high scores in another division.

“NO APOLOGIES”

The facts released this week indicated that Davidson is admitting students of good—but not of the very best—academic quality. But
alumni, coaches, and even some faculty members still complained that Davidson's “good” is too good. One admissions official summed it
up: “It’s hard to satisfy everybody. We're being accused of looking only for geniuses, which isn’t true at all. But
I'm convinced that we need not apologize for seeking out and finding the best academic bets for Davidson; that’s what
we’re doing now.”

In The Quiet College Atmosphere A Comfortable Decay Sets In
By JACK TAYLOR

In his small, dimly lit office on the third floor of Chambers, Professor John Christian Doright leaned back placidly in
his well-worn leather chair and inhaled deeply, adding to the glow of contentment which already warmed him. Autumn had arrived
in force, bringing with it the Professor’s feeling of well-being, for this was the season which he loved best. Professor
Doright knew that these sentiments were not shared by everyone. There were many who regretted Autumn’s arrival, who thought of
Autumn as dormant and death-like, as an evil that sapped life from all that lived. But, for Professor Doright, Autumn
signaled a return to sanity, a time when things settled back into their old postures and habits, returned to their
normal, usual ways. For him, Autumn was simple, certain, and reassuring.

Also, with the coming of Fall, came the students. “His boys” had become the Professor’s life, his very existence, and
he bestowed upon them every ounce of fatherly devotion and affection which his tired old heart could muster. “Father John”
they called him, and no laurel was ever carried with more pride. Professor Doright trusted his boys, but, like the
father who waits up for his son’s return each night, he worried about them when they were away for any
length of time. They were young and immature; hardly old enough or strong enough to protect themselves against the cruel
realities of life. Professor Doright always felt a sense of relief when they returned to the fold.

The professor had neither time nor respect for those heretics who were constantly screaming that experience was the best teacher,
that birds learned to fly by being pushed from the nest at an early age. “His boys” would learn of
the world all too soon; it was best to condition them first to the right things in life, that they
might have something to cling to when the nest was gone and the full force of the gale struck them.
Here, in the safety and security that are Davidson, he could teach “his boys” the right values, give them the
right answers, and guide them along the right paths. As the sapling is bent, so the tree grows. This philosophy
became an intrinsic part of the professor's teachings. His lecture notes were steeped in the right values, the accepted attitudes,
the traditional answers. Not a question was asked, not an unknown pondered. Nor, for the past fifteen years, had he
felt any need to revise or review his notes.

Long shafts of dusty light fell across the room, giving it the hollow appearance of a medieval cloister. A stench
of staleness hung in the air. Slowly, contentedly, Professor John Christian Doright inhaled the sweetness of his comfortably old pipe.

National Debt Is Thorn In Our Side:
By JOHN STONE

The United States government owes more money than all other governments in the world—combined. The question is: How dangerous to
our national well-being is the debt? If we find it dangerous, what can be done about it?

The debt is about $290,000,000,000. Assuming that we can’t pay this sum out of hand, there arises the necessity for
servicing the debt more efficiently and for countering the inflationary pressures caused by it. First, however, let us look at
some relatively hopeful statistics. In 1946 the debt was equal to 125% of the gross national wealth. In 1957 it
was worth but 65% of the same. Between 1953 and 1957 the debt rose only 4%. Private debt in 1957
was 62.7% of all indebtedness, public and private. Furthermore, most of the debt arose from moneys borrowed to fight World
War II, so we must inveigh more against war than any inefficiency.

The servicing of the debt would be of little consequence as a problem if it were not for the unhealthy
condition surrounding the ownership of the debt. The debt is owned by those of great wealth; individuals, banks, and corporations.
The primary source of money for interest, however, is the taxes of the persons of ordinary means. Thus wealth is
redistributed upwards. One simple solution to this is to increase the income tax in the upper brackets. I don’t see
this happening anytime soon.

The problem of the inflationary pressure exerted by the debt is perhaps solved more easily in terms of political resistance.
At present the government is doing most of its borrowing from commercial banks. This increases the supply of money, making
all money less valuable. The problem is to put the ownership of the debt in private hands. Before this can
be done, it is necessary that interest rates be hiked slightly, and that all bonds be long-term—perhaps even sold in
the open market. This would also expand significantly the base of ownership.

Inexpressible Pair Is Back After Western Tour

It’s not very good to be back at school this year. Selma and I took a vacation trip through the
West this summer; everywhere we went we saw Davidson boys canning peas. That takes a high degree of intelligence and
scrutinization; each pea has to be visually inspected and passed before it can be sealed in a can. The inspectors
use forceps most of the time, but every now and then you’d see a Davidson boy taking one in his
hand.

As you know, Selma has been expecting ever since last Homecoming, and, around the middle of July, she got just
what she was expecting. An extra mouth to feed and all the extra cargo shot our budget to pieces as
far as the trip was concerned, but things ironed themselves out a few weeks later when we discovered we’d left
it at a motel. Selma’s been a little bit gloomy ever since, but I keep telling her there’s another Homecoming
in a few weeks. Whenever anyone asks us, we look grave and say, “We lost our last child.”

Selma got a little nervous at the prospect of going to the bonfire Friday night, with all those men standing
around, and all those Davidson students, too. I told her she wouldn’t have any trouble if she played it cool.
“That's all you have to do at anybody’s pep rally to get by; just be sophisticated.” So I took her
up to the Anchor to buy a little sophistication beforehand. We tried hard, but they quit selling it at quarter
till twelve and we still didn’t feel sophisticated enough to come. It’s a lost cause with some of us.

The YMCA, justifiably seeking status on the Davidson campus, has initiated the Book-of-the-Semester program. This in no way implies that
Y members can read only one book a semester, although the page-a-day plan has proved successful. The college suggests that
any student unable to complete one book in a semester enroll in Professor Ostwalt’s Speed-Reading course for cretins. The author
of the book under consideration is Vance Packard. Packard, seeking literary status, whipped this book off in less than a
semester and is coming on campus to lead a symposium on the work. Hundreds of Davidson students, seeking intellectual status,
have bought the book at the bookstore and are now on page twenty-two. Mr. Packard, a thinking man, has not
only literary status but also myriads of hobbies, one of which is changing base literature into gold.
