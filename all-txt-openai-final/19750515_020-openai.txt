Sirens in the Night

When you hear sirens in the night,
And unnamed terror fills you through,
Then dark is more than loss of light:

And fear you feel is more than fright.
Ask not for whom, they wail for you,
When you hear sirens in the night.

Search for switch to make it bright.
Tungsten filaments won’t do,

The dark is more than loss of light.
It matters little, fight or flight:
Coming from is going to

When you hear sirens in the night.

Reach for something, hold her tight.
Flames of love that don’t burn through,

The dark is more than loss of light.

Fettered fall from dizzy height,
Dreams dissolve, the crash no clue
When you hear sirens in the night;
For Dark’s no more than loss of Light.

Thanatos: The Hidden Retreat

We are no longer desperate for ourselves:
the quest has too quickly ended.

And yet, that which was sought is still
unfound—

We asked, but did not receive:
We knocked, but it was not opened to us.

And yet we are to blame

For we have lacked courage to pursue.

Having only half-arrived,
being only half-born,
We have settled, alas, too contentedly
into the rut out of which we were
struggling:
The time is of business-as-usual,
We are at rest on premature laurels.

Our eyes are no longer capable of
the tears which once moved us.
Our hearts are hardened beyond grief.
Once we saw our hollowness:
we tried to fill ourselves
with ourselves
And we strove, the vital strife to find ourselves.
We had begun. But we have
retreated
into the shell-of-our-existence.

And now we refuse to see.

It has taken much too little
to assuage our grief

While the griefs of others now go
unnoticed in the silence.

In the darkness the still small
voice
has been quenched.
