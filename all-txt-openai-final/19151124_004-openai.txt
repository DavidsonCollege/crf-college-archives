4 THE DAVIDSONIAN, November 24, 1915

ORCHESTRA AND GLEE CLUB CONCERT

The College Orchestra and Glee Club gave an entertaining and humorous concert in Shearer Hall last Saturday evening at 8
o'clock. The Orchestra and Glee Club this year is the largest and one of the best ever put on by
Davidson. Its success lies both in each individual member and in the excellent leaders at the head of it. F.
H. Baker ('17) as director of the Orchestra, and J. L. Fowle ('18) as leader of the Glee Club, have
been working faithfully all the year, and much of the credit for the work must go to them.

The concert Saturday night was attended by a large number of both students and town people, and everyone present was
greatly pleased with the program. The singing of both quartets, Fowle’s solos, and the trio on violin, flute, and piano
were the features. The program rendered was:

1. Lustspiel Overture, Orchestra.

VIRGINIA-TENNESSEE CLUB HAS BANQUET

Recently the Virginia-Tennessee Club had its first banquet, which was held in the dining room of the Henderson Hotel. The
room was decorated with red and green leaves, the colors of the club. A delightful repast was served, interspersed with
a genial flow of wit and good cheer. P. B. Price gave the first toast of the evening, “Green and
Red.” L. Chambliss spoke on “Auld Lang Syne,” and J. R. Woods on “The Woods of Virginia.” L. G. Edgerton,
after an interval fraught with pleasant experiences, gave “The Virgin of Virginia,” and W. G. Somerville spoke on “The Virginia
Creeper.” The two honorary members of the club, Dr. Sentelle and Professor Wood, each gave toasts which were heartily applauded
by all. J. P. Williams presided as toastmaster and the evening proved a very enjoyable one. When the inner man
had been satisfied, several songs, including “The Swanee River” and “Carry Me Back to Old Virginia,” were sung. Before the
company broke up, cheers were given for the club, Dr. Sentelle, Professor Wood, and Mrs. Henderson.

NEW BOOKS IN LIBRARY ON NEWSPAPER WRITING

Two new books, “Newspaper Writing and Editing,” and “Making a Newspaper,” are to be found in the debating room of
the library. All, especially the new men, who are interested in newspaper work, are urged most strongly to read them,
as they bear directly on writing for The Davidsonian.

DR. FULTON AUTHOR OF NEW ENGLISH MANUAL

Dr. M. G. Fulton, of the chair of English at Davidson, together with Dr. R. G. Bressler, of the University
of Texas, and Dr. G. H. Mullin, of Texas A. and M. College, have recently had published a student’s manual
entitled, “Questions on Readings in English Literature.” It is an invaluable aid, both along practical and suggestive lines, for students
who are making a close study of representative selections of prose and poetry in English literature.

The library has received as a gift from Prof. Henry E. Shepherd ('62), of Baltimore, Md., the following books written
by him: Representative Authors of Maryland; Poems of James Ryder Randall; History of the English Language; to be added to
the following books by Dr. Shepherd, “The Life of Robert Edward Lee,” and “A Commentary on In Memoriam,” already in
the library.

Mr. W. Hudson Rogers, class of 1913, is taking graduate work at the University of Virginia.
