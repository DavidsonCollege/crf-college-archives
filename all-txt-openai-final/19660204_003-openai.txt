#### The Practices Behind Campus Journalism

The editor-in-chief stands in a swirl of responsibility. He is a traffic cop, chief consultant, copy coordinator, good guy and bad guy all in one week. He covets the few hurrahs and shoulders the many complaints that follow each issue. Working closely with the business manager, he tries his hand at advertising as well as page layout, copy reading, and headline writing, then usually finds himself picking up the loose pieces to put together a weekly newspaper.

The appearance of a newspaper comes from the pen and second of the page editor. Like an artist, he applies his own experience and determination to create a fresh and appealing, yet newsworthy, page each week.

Each week begins with a staff meeting to criticize the past issue and to plan the next edition. Page editors submit their plans for the week to the editor, assignments are made—from photographs to the Vespers article—and another edition is in the making.

No one can do his job alone as the mechanics of a well-run newspaper depend on the ability of the staff editors to work together.

Copy Editor Chris Hawk checks over an article with News Editor Sam Boyte and Feature Editor Heyward Carter after the Sunday night staff meeting. Boyte and Carter then make the assignments that determine the bulk of copy in each edition.

The copy desk is the hub of activity on Wednesday night when the paper is "put to bed." Each article is funneled through the copy desk to be read, corrected, and counted, and later to be returned for a headline. Copy readers John Wessell, Charles McEwen, Bob Vance, Dick Richards, and Bob Schofield glean the reams of each piece of copy in a standard manner; in this case, THE DAVIDSONIAN style. Careful perusal of each typewritten page means the difference between a conglomeration of opinions and a worthwhile journalistic production.

Art work is an important part of any newspaper. Photography and engraving often determine as much as one-fourth of the weekly budget of THE DAVIDSONIAN. Staff photographer George Purvis adjusts the enlarger in the publication darkroom in the College Union. THE DAVIDSONIAN depends entirely on the experience of student cameramen.

"Once you get printer’s ink on your hands, it never washes off," goes the old saw. In the case of a campus weekly, it’s easy to rub the ink in thick.

Managing Editor Louis Lesesne adjusts some metal and type in his page as Assistant Managing Editor Tom Cook observes. There are often more pieces of metal in a page than in a jigsaw puzzle of the same size, and the job of fitting the pieces together is even more demanding.

Each staff editor is perpetually alert for the unexpected. A slight error or misspelled word can ruin the value of an article, or even of the entire issue. Last-minute corrections are not rare, for a moment’s lack of attention means inevitable chagrin when the press begins to roll.

Sports Editor Bill Briggs points out a change on the final proof of his page to the linotype operator as Assistant Sports Editor Arch McCallum looks on. The clattering of the old, flatbed press in the background signals the climax of one week’s effort and the beginning of plans for the next week’s edition.
