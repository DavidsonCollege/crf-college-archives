Davidson Officer Dies In Collision

Davidson police officer Steven Richard Strejc, 29, was killed at 6:45 a.m. on Monday when a van driven by Richard Giles of Mooresville collided head-on with his 1974 Volkswagen.

Strejc was traveling north on N.C. 115 when Giles swerved into the opposite lane of traffic to avoid hitting a car that was turning into a private drive. The accident occurred approximately two miles north of the Davidson town limits.

Strejc, off duty at the time of the accident, had just completed his morning delivery of the Charlotte Observer and was going to get breakfast.

Davidson officer Raymond Thrower arrived at the scene approximately two minutes after the accident and reported that Strejc had no pulse at that time and had apparently died on impact.

Davidson Police Chief Jack Warlitk said, “Steve had served for the entire period that I have been with the Davidson Police Department and had a spotless employment record for the total period of his employment. He was held in my highest regard for his professional ability and as a person. I personally feel that the Town of Davidson has suffered a great loss.”

Hal Kluttz, a former Davidson police officer, reflecting on his acquaintance with the deceased both as a personal friend and co-worker, said, “Steve was real easy going and easy to work with. He had a lot of compassion in the way he handled his job. It was a shock.”

Cliff Archer, of Archer’s Texaco and Wrecker Service, said, “He was a really fine fellow. If I had to work late, or was called out at night on a job, Steve would always drop around to see that everything was all right.”

Cornelius Sgt. Terry DeRhodes said, “We never heard any complaints about him from anyone. If you needed him for backup, he was there when he was called or before.”

Funeral services for Strejc were held Wednesday at Hankins & Whittington in Charlotte. Davidson police served as pallbearers and the Cornelius and Davidson College police were honorary pallbearers.
