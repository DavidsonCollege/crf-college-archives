**Spoon River Anthology Drama Spectacle Attempts Theatrics**

**A Review By FRANCES TOWNSEND News Editor**

Of late, the Thespian efforts of Director Rupert Barber and the Davidson Drama Department have demonstrated a distinct fondness for the nurture and indulgence of a creature sometimes called "Theatrics," or "The Theatrical Effect." As anyone who has ever seen both a well and a poorly conceived dramatic production knows, there is but a fine line between theater and theatrics. And a successful piece of stage-work will normally (and hopefully) have a little of both. The well-schooled critic, however, should immediately pounce on such a statement and add that there is no practical separation of such aspects of the drama, and that therefore such a distinction is artificial and meaningless. The well-schooled critic is, of course, right. Theater and theatrics (the erstwhile Aristotelian would probably say Language and Spectacle) are concepts which are, for practical purposes, indistinguishable in a whole. It is only when one becomes of glaring predominance, that the presence (or lack) of the other is felt at all. And unfortunately, the Drama Department’s production of Edgar Lee Master’s group of poems, "Spoon River Anthology," in many respects reflects an obvious tendency towards the theatrical.

The production declares itself to be an entertainment with music. Since this is a vague sobriquet at best, and since it becomes difficult to talk at any length about an entity which claims only to be entertainment, for the moment I will operate under the assumption that the show was called a poetry reading, with music and dance (which in fact it is). There are a number of disturbing factors connected with the execution of the poetry reading. One is the issue of the costuming. The characters in Master’s poems all communicate their life stories as they see them from beyond the grave. Appropriately enough, it would seem, they are clothed in burial garb. Each of the costumes for the male actors are specific, quaintly styled suits while all the female actors but one are clad alike. However, at odds with the specificity of the costuming, is the circumstance that while there are 40 some roles portrayed in the group of poems, there are only one fourth that many actors. The idea that each of the actors represents a number of different characters is obscured by the specificity of the dress. Certainly, the costuming is attractive on an absolute scale, but it is inappropriate to the show, and becomes both confusing and distracting. How much more effective the poetry would have been had there been a generalized costume for the male members of the company and one for the females.

Another annoying tendency present was the forced interaction of the actors on the stage. In a reading of this sort, where actors do not play specific parts, and there is no plot structure which demands specific presences on stage other than those of the actors addressing the audience, the relationships between characters suggested by scenes such as the dance at the end of Act I are wholly confusing and superfluous. Finally, the garbling of speeches...

The Davidson College Drama Department will present their last performance of Edgar Lee Masters’ "Spoon River Anthology" tonight at 8:15 in Hodson Hall. The play is directed by Rupert T. Barber.through overly rapid delivery or undue histrionics is totally reprehensible. Poems are not series of words, or sentences or thoughts: they are the words themselves, and the loss of one word constitutes the loss of the whole poem. Through all of the incoherence manifested in Spoon River Anthology, however, a number of moments shone bright. The singing and acting of Patsy Arnold and the instrumental talent and voice of Rick Gentry were a delightful surprise. Also, the performances of many actors unknown to the Davidson stage anticipate the possibility of some fine future. Notable among these were Wyndell Patterson, Debra Kyle, Robert Hoag, Richard Roylance, and Tony conceived and executed theater.

gives him love kicks and blows and, anxious over his health, drags him along on jogging and bicycle trips. The best friend’s wife, a harpist, rapes our hero whenever they're alone together and makes him play a game called “horsey” (Gerard Damiano, take note!). When his fellow orchestra members nail two of his shoes to the floor, he shows up at an airport with one black shoe and one yellow, a suspicious action which makes him the comic.

Written by Yves Robert and Francis Veber and directed by Robert, ‘The Tall Blonde Man with One Black Shoe’ begins nicely and dwindles toward the end. Many scenes fall flat such as an elaborate seduction scene in which the leading actor, Pierre Richard, not only plays a blunderbuss but also does it bluntly. One scene, more successful but also indicating problems inherent in the plot, involves a concert where the wife sends her husband, and the lover, a friend of both, looks on with dismay. The comic aspects of this scene arise from the three principals as they come in at the wrong time or with the wrong piece of music, miss their cues, and otherwise mess up the concert. Instead of developing toward a hilarious climax, the scene has a few scattered funny moments and then ends abruptly as a new scene begins. If this film starred an excellent comedian who had a hand in the screenplay, it might have achieved the excellence of “Dick” and “Duchess of Idaho.” But Robert directs with moderation, leaving only parts of the movie to maintain the excellence of “Dick” and “Duchess.”

The Charlotte Opera Association will present Verdi’s beautiful opera, ‘A Masked Ball,’ Feb. 1 at 8 p.m. and Feb. 3 at 2:30 p.m. in Ovens Auditorium. Gilda Cruz-Rome, leading soprano of the Metropolitan Opera, will star as Amelia. The New York City Opera’s leading tenor, Salvador Nova, will play King Gustav III of Sweden. Also featured will be Seymour Schwartzman, a leading baritone for NYC Opera company. He will be singing the part of Ankerstrom, the king’s secretary and advisor. The opera revolves around a love triangle created by the characters, leading to the king’s assassination. Tickets are available for both performances. Call the opera office at 372-9664.

UNC-C plans to present the Mimi Garrard Dance Company January 29 and 30. On Tuesday, the company will present a concert performance in Rowe Theatre at 8:15 p.m. The following day, the company will present lecture-discussions at 10 a.m., 1 p.m., and 2:30 p.m. This is a new group of dancers who are sweeping the college tour scene, causing great excitement across the country. If you’re interested in all forms of dance, this is a group that you will not want to miss.
