Writing on THE DAVIDSONIAN sports staff for the past four years has been a fun-filled, hectic, exciting, frustrating, creative, and humorous experience. The satisfactions and disappointments have been many, but here are the ones we remember most vividly:

- Enjoying Rocky Crosswhite’s weekly “On The Bench” column...
- Homecoming 1968 - wearing freshman beanies and forming a “human tunnel” for the team...
- Going to Charlottesville for the 41-14 disaster against UVA, as the Cavaliers rolled up an ACC record of 692 yards total offense...
- Having a Phi Beta Kappa, Homer Smith, as football coach...
- 1969 - the Year of the Cat in basketball - going 27-3, being ranked as high as second nationally; those were the days...
- Working on the paper until 2 a.m. almost every Thursday morning; writing stories that were never printed, or were often cut in half...
- Interviewing Coach Stevens - the Bomber was always good for such perceptive insights as: “I’ve come to the conclusion that the only difference between the so-called major and minor sports is who gets the money for scholarships”...
- Repeating Furman 77-14, Richmond 37-7, and East Carolina 42-27 on the way to the Tangerine Bowl, and the Slade-to-Kelly-or-Hannen passing combination...
- Watching the Tangerine Bowl on TV, except for the third quarter. Network difficulties...
- Lefty taking his T-Bird to Maryland and leaving the basketball program to Larry Brown...
- Larry Brown leaving the confusion of the basketball program to Terry Holland...
- Terry Holland not leaving for Wake Forest, fortunately...
- Hearing the DC Pep Band render “Windy” and “25 or 6 to 4” at least 85 times during basketball season...
- Trying to decipher the many moods of Coach Harry Fogleman in covering the tennis and soccer teams...
- The agony of watching Maloy, Cook, and Kroll fritter away their senior year and miss a shot at the NCAA title...
- Coach Heath Whittle’s mysterious analysis of an indoor track meet: “We just wasn’t ready for that stiff of competition”...
- Seeing a 59-game home basketball winning streak shattered by an upstart Furman team and Country Joe Williams...
- Writing lampoon stories about Bryan Adrian and other things, and seeing them almost come true...
- Running in the Freshman Cake Race and finishing seventy-third, luckily getting the next-to-last cake...
- The Varsity-Alumni football game, where there are as many drop-out football players on the old-timers as there are alumni...
- Doing voluminous research in trying to write the Whittle retirement story a year early...
- The yearly football press releases announcing the dozens of blue-chippers who will play WILDCAT FOOTBALL... For example: “Dexter Dudley, a 5-11, 165-lb tackle who earned nine letters in eight sports at Central Northeast Upstate Valley Poly High School, and made third team all-Upper South Midlands Tri-County Conference”...
- All the fourth quarter losses in football the past two years...
- Trying to write an IMAC basketball report...
- The sad story of Bryan Adrian, and the promising career that never was...
- Listening to the rapid gibberish of “Weird” Harold Wilkerson behind the plate: “Huh-na-huh-na, cum-schenck, cum-schenck” or something like that...
- Dave Fagg’s two degrees of winning: on the field and off the field...
- Listening to Ray Cook of WRKB, the only announcer in captivity who would criticize Madison Square Garden...
- A new basketball coach, Jim Lasagna (or Larry who?)...
- Trying to run on, and write about, the track team at the same time...
- Tennis stars Koury, Dumansky, and Lankenau - where are they when we need them?...
- Two conference championships in soccer - another dynasty?...
- The ubiquitous, inexhaustible Sterling Martin, and his many, many, many, many jobs; the only coach who can still outrun the team...
- Watching Ray Swetenburg almost outscore Guilford in a track meet...

It is hard to capture the intangibles of four years of the Davidson sports scene. All those people and events have given us a most rewarding four years, and to them go our thanks. The good has always outweighed the bad... we hope it will stay that way for Davidson sports.

Fagg Praises Varsity Gridders After Alumni Game Victory
By JOE EARLE
Sports Editor

After more than three weeks of practice this spring, Grid Coach Dave Fagg finally got to...see his team in action last Saturday in the alumni-varsity game. Fagg was pleased with what he saw in the varsity’s 34-20 defeat of the old-timers. “The team is more aggressive and quicker than last year’s team,” Fagg said, “and they have the best spirit of any team I’ve seen.” Sandy Carnegie, coach for the alumni team, also complimented the team’s speed and overall performance. Carnegie said that the team was much harder to work against in the line because of their speed and agility. (Staff photo by Rodriguez)

Putting Errors Drop Boyd To Second In Golf Tourney
By BRUCE BECKER
Staff Writer

Rusty Boyd’s 36-hole score of 153 led the Davidson linksters to a fifth-place finish in the Southern Conference golf tournament. Boyd tied for second with a freshman from Richmond. The winner was Pennik from ECU with a score of 149. The tournament was held on Tuesday and Thursday of this week at the par-72 Quail Ridge Country Club in Sanford. The tournament used medalist play with each team represented by six or seven players. The team scores were determined by the five best 36-hole scores from each squad. East Carolina won the team competition with a compiled score of 783.

After Tuesday’s play, the Wildcat linksters held second place and Boyd was among the leaders with a two-over-par score of 74. Boyd was leading the field after 27 holes. He was one stroke ahead of Pennik when he ran into trouble on the 28th hole. “I was leading the field by one,” said Boyd, “when I ran into trouble on the back nine. I three-putted four times.”

On the first hole of the back nine, Boyd holed in three from 100 feet. Later on a par five, Boyd reached the green in two. From 15 feet he tried to can the putt but rammed it over the cup and three feet past. He missed the shot coming back and parred his chance for an eagle. Shaken by his failing putter, Boyd also three-putted from 10 and 25 feet.

For the rest of the Davidson squad, Bob Reni, a freshman, shot a 159; Jim Ray, sophomore, had a 161. Both Sam Mitchener, a junior, and David Faison, a senior, shot 170’s for the linksters. The tournament was scheduled to run Tuesday and Wednesday. However, in the second round, rain disrupted play. Officials of the tournament attempted to play despite the dismal weather but were forced to postpone play until Thursday. Dick Spinner, a sophomore, became ill from golfing in the rain and was forced to return to Davidson on Wednesday, giving the Wildcats only five players with which to finish the tournament.

The alumni had several problems preparing for the game and were especially hurt in their small amount of practice time. “We only practiced for an hour prior to the game,” Carnegie said, “and that was to get plays worked out.” The confusion over what plays to run was intensified when the varsity decided to switch defenses Saturday morning because of scouts from Wake Forest, ECU, and several other schools.

Fagg said that he feels that the varsity should continue to work for a balanced running and passing attack. Despite the relatively small size of the Davidson line, he feels that the backfield will be able to work well against their opponents in the fall. “Scotty Shipp has really developed well this spring, showing both passing ability and leadership,” Fagg said. “He’s going to be a real fine quarterback.” Shipp completed 10 of 22 passes in last Saturday’s game, with two interceptions. Fagg also complimented the running backs, saying he would match Dave Ingold, Al McCallum, and John Webel against any backs he has coached.

In preparation for the regular season, a system to incorporate freshman players into the team is being worked out. Freshmen will be able to play in varsity competition for the first time next fall, and Fagg said that arrangements were being made to incorporate several in the program, including football camp and fall training.
