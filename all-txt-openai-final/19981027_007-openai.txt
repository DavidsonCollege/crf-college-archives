The double major dilemma. I have a dilemma. It is a dilemma that several (though not most) of you have, too. It is the dilemma of the double major wannabe. Here’s my problem: I want to major in both English and political science. By the end of my senior year, I will have taken at least the minimum number and types of classes required. The only thing left is colloquium. And, lucky me, both English and poli sci colloquiums are currently offered at nearly the same time. This creates a problem, as I cannot graduate with two B.A.s unless I take two colloquiums. And, as things currently stand, I cannot take two colloquiums unless I become more than one person — and then I guess people would have to call me “Sari” or “Sares” when I was with myself. But I digress. 

Anyway, right now, the prospect of successfully double majoring is looking fairly bleak for me. Yes, Dr. Lewis did offer me a faint hope when she said that the English department would do everything they could to save my (and others’) double majors, but I understand that these things are complicated and not easy to remedy. So I’m not counting on anything. The colloquiums-in-conflict deal is, in fact, multi-faceted. There are many reasons (some more compelling than others) to keep colloquiums at the same time as they are now. Foremost, changing times to accommodate relatively few students could cause problems for those whose currently non-conflicting colloquiums may become conflicting after the time change. However, there is also the task of finding a time when both colloquium professors can meet for two hours, two or three days a week. That in itself is often difficult enough, even without adding in the needs of a minority of “problem students.”

So what options are we left with? Apparently, independent studies are out; not only would we have to find a professor willing to devote that much time to us, but the point of colloquium, according to those I talked to, is to get all the (insert department here) majors together in one big class. And what about teaching colloquium both semesters? That, too, would ruin “the point,” I guess — never mind that English and poli sci are two of the larger majors at Davidson and should maybe be split into smaller sections, anyway. Okay, so what’s left? Not much, it seems — unless people are willing to consider completely overhauling the system. It’s sad to me that one class can keep me from achieving what I’ve worked so hard for. And it frightens me that my safety nets, those whom I consulted, who signed my major forms, failed to inform me that I needed to look into when colloquiums for my respective majors were held. We’re all human, and I understand that people forget. But the current system doesn’t allow for such slip-ups, doesn’t leave room for human error. And if we, the students, are not informed in good time, how can we possibly plan for the future by (as is suggested) taking one colloquium junior year and one senior year?

It is becoming increasingly apparent that the colloquium system is too inflexible to serve students’ needs in the era of double majors. If it is necessary to be able to plan far enough ahead so as to avoid conflicting colloquiums, many of us who don’t know we want to double major early on (or can’t find an acceptable advisor soon enough) are unceremoniously divested of the ability to double major. And, simply put, that’s not fair. Either the colloquium system needs to be reformed (perhaps by not putting the most popular combinations of majors in conflict with each other), or double majors need to be reevaluated. When double majors were first proposed to the faculty here, opposition to the idea arose partly because of the colloquium problem. In the end, though, how much does being able to double major matter? As Dr. Kazee said, if actual people were adversely affected, the department would attempt to change things. After all, not being an official major leaves me free to spend time on the classes I want to take and free from the more odious (but required) ones. And, as many people have told me in sympathetic tones, in the real world, employers and graduate schools probably won’t care all that much whether I was a double major or not. After all, I come from Davidson, and as long as I show achievement in the classes I do take, it won’t matter whether I pulled off double majoring or not. And if anyone does think to ask, I have a fairly good excuse, I think. I agree with this more or less, but still unresolved is whether double majoring will matter to me in the future. I’m glad I’ll most likely not be penalized by admissions people and interviewers, but what about how I feel? I admit, this probably won’t ruin my life, but it'd still be nice to get something official for my troubles. For now, at the prompting of Dr. Lewis, I’m staying with both majors until a definite conclusion is reached. But I can’t hang in limbo forever, and I have a feeling that, before long, I and several others will be forced to choose one love over the other. And I hate to.Imagine what it will be like.

# LETTER TO THE EDITOR

## Caught in the crossfire

To the Editor:

The Davidsonian has now become a paper that continues to publish articles that are just an ongoing feud between two secluded parties. One week we read an article by a sophomore who pointlessly tears apart the freshman class and their involvement in The Davidsonian. Then the next week the freshmen must immaturely retaliate and write equally pointless articles that are merely sarcastic and rude. We’ve read this now for several weeks and anticipate reading another failed attempt at constructive criticism in the near future. Furthermore, it’s not just ONE inane article that gets published in the most recent issue of The Davidsonian, but rather we see SEVERAL different articles and references to the same, purposeless fight. The disinterested reader is merely caught in the crossfire, questioning any relevance this has on the Davidson community. How much longer must we Davidson students subject ourselves to such immature, personal bickering?

There is nothing wrong with controversy. In fact, it certainly makes a newspaper all the more interesting and enjoyable to read. However, I hope that the editor and the writers for The Davidsonian can find it within themselves to debate meaningful and intelligent topics rather than whether or not the freshmen play with the magnetic silverware. The Davidson students deserve a newspaper that they can take pride in and enjoy reading, not some constant cat-fight between the same people that continues to remind me more and more of high school.

## Is there room for a coed eating house at Davidson?

Throughout my entire life, I have always had some sort of idea resting on the proverbial back burner of my mind. It was the type of idea that I would ponder only when I was stretching for an editorial topic or when I was partially conscious in the early hours of the morning (often these two events went hand-in-hand last year). Lately, there has been one back burner topic of mine that seems to have been simmering for long enough, that topic: the coed eating house.

With the completion of the coeducational celebration this past Sunday, I think that it is safe to say that at least every person on this campus has had some form of involvement with the events that occurred. While your personal involvement may not have been first-hand, or even second-hand, for that matter, you still might have found yourself discussing what it meant for Davidson to go coed twenty-five years ago with your friends or maybe even in some of your classes. However, despite all of the celebrating that went along with the fact that women came to campus 25 years ago, no one seems to have noticed the fact that in that same short time span our school has found a way to destroy what took 136 years to happen in the first place; that is, the merging of men and women together.

Now, before I go on a tirade about the possible means of putting a coed eating house on campus, let me dissuade all readers from thinking that I’m not in favor of either the fraternities or the women’s eating houses. I am not against fraternities, nor am I against women’s eating houses. First of all, with the fraternities, I personally think that if you want to join a group where you know that you can count on everyone else and that there is a national board to back you up, more power to you. I also think that the fraternities on this campus bring a lot to the school and some have a great history here. However, I just don’t see myself as the fraternity-type, and I know there are other guys out there who have the same feelings.

Now, with the women’s eating houses, I would have to start by repeating everything that I’ve said before (just swap “eating houses” with “fraternities” and change “national board” to “Patterson Court Council”; please make other changes as necessary); however, I think that there is one more thing that I can add. The women’s eating houses at Davidson are one of Davidson’s creations. They are not a national idea, they are a Davidson idea. However, prior to this idea, there was one other idea that also was spawned at Davidson, and that was the coed eating house. Carrie Arthur noted in last week’s article, “The integration of men and women together.”
