Service from a Friendly Bank

Having finished your college education and have
entered the world, one of the greatest assets you
can have is the confidence and recommendation of
your bank.

One step in this direction is opening a checking ac-
count and managing it in a satisfactory manner. In so
doing, you manage your own affairs and you will
have the opportunity of handling the affairs of
others.
