"Dear : I am now up where the Trade St. is on S N. C. fun is... Things have changed
and I am over here in the mud. The army has been the very thing for me. I weigh about
eighteen pounds more than I did when I enlisted and am as hard as a rock. Believe I would go
out for football if I were back at college. I have been on my job for a day and night
at the time without rest and can get away with it. We have good food and very good hours most
of the time. We have four heavy blankets and sleep well when we get a chance.

"It is rather exciting to hear the shells whistle thru the air.

"Don't talk about these little French mademoiselles. I have seen them and I believe you will like army life all
right.

"We use French coinage altogether. Remember me to all the boys."

Pvt. Tazewell N. Morton, Battery B, 52nd Artillery, C. A. C. American C. F., France.
