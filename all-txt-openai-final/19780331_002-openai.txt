**Debate team places fourth.** Maria Patterson and Lindsey Robertson finished in fourth place with a 5-2 record in the Delta
Sigma Rho-Tau Kappa Alpha National Debate Championship held at the University of Illinois last week. Patterson, the Davidson Debate Team
captain, received the first place Speaker Award in the tournament. Davidson debated negative against the resolution: The federal government should
pass a law to prohibit and/or regulate pornography. Among the teams Davidson defeated were Butler University, Ball State University, Wabash
College, DePauw University, and the University of Illinois. Teams from 67 colleges and universities throughout the U.S. participated. This spring,
the Davidson College Debate Team plans to hold a public debate on campus and an exhibition debate at North Iredell
High School. The team also plans to participate in the First International Women’s Debate Championship April 14-15 at Barnard College,
Columbia University.

**Applicants set new record.** Applications to Davidson this year represent a slight increase over previous years, according to Dean of
Admissions H. Edmunds White. Last year 1013 men and 511 women applied, making a total of 1524. As of March
20, 1020 men and 523 women have applied, making a total of 1543, the largest in the school’s history. According
to the College Board, while the number of applicants to colleges and universities varies from year to year, in general
the figure is remaining stable. White attributes the slight increase in applications to Davidson to better recruiting methods. “The single
most important factor is the good recruiting job by our current students. Many applicants indicate that the reason they are
applying is the positive feelings Davidson students have expressed for the school,” stated White. White also feels the admissions staff
has for the past few years been doing a better job acquainting visitors with the school and encouraging potential students
to apply. The admissions office hopes to keep the total enrollment at 1300. With that goal in mind, the number
of freshmen accepted this year will be roughly equivalent to last year. White believes that the competition among men for
spaces is similar to previous years, but that women may find it increasingly difficult to gain acceptance.

Lovell comments on WDAV (Continued from page 1)

After May 1, he admits that development in each of the programming areas—classical, rock, jazz, religious, educational, sports, and news—is
unequal. “The classical programming is coming along fine,” said Lovell. The station has acquired exclusive arrangements with five major symphonies
and three of the four major opera companies. WDAV will offer “alternative” rock music, shunning the top 40. Both the
rock and jazz records are adequate for now, Lovell believes, but in all areas, some of the record library is
old and unusable. “We will add to the record library as we can.”

Plans for the religious area include an expansion beyond programming the Sunday services at DCPC by adding syndicated material and
drawing innovative ideas from the community. Lovell says that the station’s commitment to educational programming will be “modest” until funding
expands. “We hope to develop the resources in the community, the faculty and students, and pool the educational resources of
area schools.”

The immediate goal for sports is to broadcast all of the Davidson football and basketball games. Later on, a sports
interview show may be aired. Though the current programming schedule calls for the broadcast of a 1-hour news program each
day, Lovell hints that this is an unattainable goal until studio facilities are improved to accommodate roundtable discussions and interviews.

Long-range plans for the station include the purchase of an automation system. According to Lovell, the system, which will play
programs pre-taped by student disc jockeys, will serve as a backup during between-term vacations and in the summer. Until the
automation system is purchased, students will be hired by the College to man the station during vacation periods and in
the summer.

Lovell hopes that word-of-mouth publicity will promote the station; in addition, the station will mail out a monthly program guide
which for the first two or three issues “will be a publicity tool as well.” Lovell recognizes that the future
of the station is uncertain. But, he said, “I can only be optimistic. I think the public support is there—all
we have to do is reach them. So much depends on money and public support. The essential thing is to
get on the air so we will have a product to market.”
