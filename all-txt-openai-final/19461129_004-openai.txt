This necessitated the installation of a small pump to return the water to the boilers. Any previously unexplainable “moans and groans” from this area are hereby accounted for.

It is hoped that all men have grasped the significance of these facts and, on the basis of an enlightened understanding, bless rather than curse their silent sentinels the next time they awaken in need of an ice pick.

FROSH PLOT

ment in our midst, or is he merely a con-man, an insignificant in the organization? This is, of course, unknown, since both Judge Archer and the director of D.B.I. refused to make further comment. However, my conjecture is that this man is but a small operator in the most treacherous and deadly fifth column in the history of Davidson. Momentarily we upperclassmen may expect to hear of the destruction of this gang as the work of the D.B.I. renews its culmination.

again captured the loose pigskin. On the next play, substitute fullback Dick Sparks blasted through right guard and plowed 19 yards for a score. Henderson again converted to give the Citadel a commanding 8 point lead with only a few minutes remaining.

Jake Wade engineered a desperate march in the waning moments of the fray, but the luckless Cats once again bogged down on the 20 yard stripe. The Citadel then ran four time-consuming plays as the game ended moments later.
