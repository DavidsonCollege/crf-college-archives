Davidson women’s field hockey competed this weekend in Boone, NC against Appalachian State on Friday, Sept. 18, for their first
NorPac East season game, and then against Wake Forest #3 on Sunday, Sept. 20 in Winston-Salem, NC.

The Wildcats lost to Appalachian State 3-2 after coming back from a 3-0 deficit in the first half. In the
first 13 minutes of the game, the Mountaineers scored all three of their game goals. Nicole Morgan scored twice for
the Mountaineers and teammate Lisa Charney scored once to bring Appalachian State to their 3-0 lead. 'Cats’ Christine Rua ’12
scored the first goal for the Wildcats in the last 21 minutes of the second half, followed by a penalty
shot from Annie Evans ’13 with less than 6 minutes left in the game. The Mountaineers pulled out the win
although the Wildcats outshot Appalachian State 13-9. Coach Sutton believes that the team will be able to defeat the Mountaineers
with more time and on the home field when the two teams meet again in October.

On Sunday, the nationally ranked Wake Forest field hockey team defeated the 'Cats 6-0. The Demon Deacons scored 4 goals
in the first half giving them a 4-0 lead over the Wildcats. Alex Wolfgang-Price and Kaitlin Piosa scored the first
two goals of the game in the 14th and 15th minutes of the competition. The first half ended without any
shots on goal by the Wildcats, but they returned in the second half with 4 shots from Jennie Mostellar ’10,
Rua, and Gray Robinson ’12, holding the Demon Deacons to only 5 shots. Lisa Casella and Faith Adams of Wake
Forest scored the final two goals of the match to bring the Demon Deacons to their shut-out win of 6-0.
Overall, Wake Forest had a shot margin of 14-4, with Davidson goalkeepers, Christa Goeke ’10 and Sarah Fisher ’13, each
with one save.

The Wildcats now stand with an overall 2-6 record and a conference record of 0-1. Women’s field hockey will take
on New Hampshire next Friday, Sept. 25 at home at 6 p.m.
