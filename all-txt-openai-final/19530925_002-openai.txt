Watch And Wait

Last year the hue and cry was heard for miles around when it became evident that all the efforts of the students and others to the contrary, the freshmen were still going to take their meals in the College Union Cafeteria. The freshmen and some independents have now been eating at the Union for more than two weeks, and within the present semester both friend and foe of the system will have an opportunity to see how many of the criticisms raised when the idea was first mentioned are valid and how many are not.

It is no secret that this semester will be a trial run, so to speak, subject either to continuation or abandonment, depending upon how it works out for all concerned. For the present at least it would appear most advantageous for both pro and con to sit quietly on the sidelines and see what unfolds. If it simply does not work, certainly the faculty and administration should not and presumably will not, try to “make it work” at the expense of the students involved. On the other hand, the fear has been expressed from some quarters of the administration and faculty that some students, particularly disgruntled fraternity men will seek by devious and sundry means to throw a monkey wrench into the works in order to “make it not work.” We feel that this fear is almost completely unwarranted, if not entirely so. Certainly fraternities would have everything to lose and nothing to gain by employing acts of overt “sabotage.”

At this stage of the game, discretion is the better part of valor. We can see no way that fraternities could possibly be helped by the present system, though there are grounds for doubting that the injury be as serious as was at first imagined. At any rate we have a semester to watch and see exactly what the sum total of the results will be, both on the fraternity and on the freshman side of the ledger.

Rush Week: Good or Bad

On the eve of tomorrow's pledging ceremonies, that will probably see more than 200 freshmen and transfers joining the eleven social fraternities here on the campus, we feel that a few comments from this corner in passing are not out of order. Much has been said about college fraternities, both for and against, but perhaps the greatest criticism today stems from the hurt and heartbreak that fraternities and fraternity rushing are said to cause among boys that don’t make one of the Greek Letter organizations. We would not be so brazen as to deny that there have been more than a few boys who wanted a bid to a fraternity and didn’t get one, or who didn’t get that bid from the fraternity that they wanted especially. This happens every year, at any school, and it will most surely happen here again tomorrow. Perhaps there is relatively little of what the fraternity critics like to call permanent injury to the personality as a result of the rushing system here at Davidson in comparison to larger schools where fraternity membership is a “must” for social acceptance. But for the day at least this will prove small consolation to the boy who didn’t get the bid for which he was waiting.

It would be easy to glibly say that the man in question should simply shrug off his disappointment and forget it. It would be easy to say but not so easy to believe. Yet it is most assuredly true that the heartache or the happiness that may come as a result of whether or not that certain envelope is in the mailbox tomorrow morning is not necessarily an ill omen or a good one for a successful and fruitful life at college. It is what happens afterward that really counts. Many a boy that all the fraternities are in hot pursuit of thinks that his hour has arrived when he collects his bids at the P.O., becomes lax in his ways, and slumps into both social and scholastic mediocrity. And there have been more than a few boys who were all but overlooked in the rush who have later proved their mettle in one phase of campus life or another. Making a fraternity, or making a particular fraternity, is in itself neither good nor bad. The time of real testing comes afterward. Let no one be either too hurt or happy at the result of tomorrow's bidding. If you join a fraternity, don’t let it go to your head; if you don’t, don’t let it go to your heart.
