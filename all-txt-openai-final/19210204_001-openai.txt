| THEDA _ g} - FOR A BETTER DAVIDSON SONIAN MAKE © BIBLE CLASSES ry Vol. VII. OMICRON DELTA KAPPA
INITIATES THREE DAVIDSON GRADUATES On the night of January 22, 1921, Coaches H. M. Grey and Fred Hengeveld, together with
Dr. Tolly Thompson, were duly initiated into the Delta Circle of the Omicron Delta Kappa Honorary Fraternity. Coach Grey, '17,
who has won a warm spot in the heart of every Davidson supporter, is one of the best-known football coaches
in the South. Coach Hengeveld, '17, our admired basketball and baseball coach, is also a strong supporter of everything for
the betterment of athletics on our campus. Dr. “Tolly” Thompson, '05, and now a professor at Union Seminary, was delivering
a series of talks on “Your Life Work” here to the students at the time of the initiation. These men
have been of great service to their college and on this account, they made themselves very worthy of receiving the
honor that the O. D. K. is able to confer upon men who have done so much to further the
interests of the college in every way. ——We Want 10 Class Reunions in 1921—— Students Become Members of Aqua Club
Knights of Neptune Make Merry at Infrequent Convention During the greater part of last week all events, local and sectional,
hinged around the magnificent Infrequent Convention of the International Knights of Neptune, which it was our exquisite pleasure and superb
honor to have holden in our humble hamlet. The wheels of industry skidded, and labor, love, and law, marked time;
while among our sometime desolate hovels and rambling ruins, Queen Festivity sat enthroned, and swayed her hilarious scepter over those
who came to worship amid the scenes of revelry and discord, where fun ran rife. Chiefest among those things which
it was permitted to us to see, and by far the most laughable of all the laughable events in the
wonderful week of gayety, were the initiations of the Priests of Mystic Whiteness. It may be said for the benefit
of the uninformed that initiations to this degree can be held only on the occasion of a specific, mystic, white
signal from the heavens. And it so happened that at this very convention the signal appeared. Now this degree is
very high among all the high and honorable degrees in Neptune, and greatly to be desired. For it is even
higher—yea, much higher—than the very high degree of Frigid Shower. So, when the signal appeared from the heavens, the Priests
lost no time in rounding up their victims. The writ of habeas corpus was straightway suspended, for the time being,
and in its stead were issued writs of quo vadis and sub nivem. In high places and low places, along
highways and hedges, in the marketplace and on the commons the Priests carried on—yes, carried on something scandalous. Hundreds and
thousands were persecuted with the rites of Mysterious Whiteness. And nowhere, when the sun was low, could you find any
bloodless, untrodden snow! Other and countless degrees of Neptune were conferred. Among the most high and worthy were: Soda, Dish,
Florida, Fire, Joy, Pluto, and Frigid Shower. Highest of all honors conferred were those upon Pitts Douglas and Doc LaFar,
who received the Mississippi (Father of Waters) at the hands of Jap Cumming and Chink Witkinson, Pacific Knights from the
Eastern Realm. Bill Roberts, Star Le’ Forward of 1921 Has Proven Himself One of Best Players of the Carolinas William
Worth Roberts, better known to his many admirers as “Bill,” is a forward and the star point getter on the
Wildcat basketball quintet. Wilmington, N. C., claims this lad as a native son and Bill says he is proud of
it. Bill entered Davidson during “the good ole days” of the S. A. T. C. He played class and company
ball that fall and looked ripe for the Varsity. But the call of the shipyards was too strong and he
did not return in the spring of ‘19. But with the re-opening of college in the fall, Bill returned to
his alma mater. He was the mainstay of the Soph team, the undefeated champions of that year. As chief basket
tosser on the Varsity, he won a warm spot in the heart of every true supporter of the Red and
Black. He hung up the enviable record of scoring more than half the points of his entire team. After the
holidays this year the report came out that Bill would not return to college. At this rumor, the bottom fell
out of the Wildcat stock. But it soared high when he blew in a week late, but all the more
welcome. So far this spring the Wilmington lad has more than upheld his reputation. In the three games played on
the Hill, he has collected 59 points. Against N. C. State, he rang up 26 points, exactly doubling his opponent's
score. Great things are looked for from him on the Virginia trip. If Bill is going good, three more games
will be hung up on the right side of the Wildcat ledger. ——We Want 10 Class Reunions in 1921—— “The
feller that puts his weddin’ off 'till times gits normal is liable to have to git normal himself.” “Next to
the originator of a good sentence is the first quoter of it.” “It is not strength but art which obtains
the prize.” Lieut. M. H. Ellis Begins Work at Davidson Comes Here from Service on Mexican Border, Accompanied by His
Family Lieut. M. H. Ellis, of the Cavalry, has recently been detailed as one of the military instructors at Davidson.
Lieutenant Ellis comes to this R. O. T. C. unit direct from the Mexican border, where he has served ever
since receiving his permanent commission. A charming wife and two promising youngsters make up his family. Both his children are
boys, one being two years old and the other four months. The Ellis family will reside in the Houston house
until the Helper cottage can be put in shape for them. Lieutenant Ellis comes originally from the North, Pennsylvania being
his home state. He graduated from Allegheny College, at which his wife was then one of the co-eds. At Leavenworth,
the Lieutenant received his commission and has since seen border service in Company “L” of the Twelfth Cavalry. As a
token of their appreciation, his men presented a gold watch to him just before his departure to take up the
work here. Already the new Lieutenant and his family are spoken of in the highest terms by all who have
met them, and undoubtedly the Davidson men will do all in their power to make Lieutenant Ellis’ work here as
pleasant as possible. ——We Want 10 Class Reunions in 1921—— DAVIDSON PUBLICATIONS TO BE REPRESENTED IN N. C. PRESS ASSOCIATION
A meeting of all the editors of the college papers and magazines in the state has been called for February
5th, in Chapel Hill. The purpose of the meeting is to form a college press association for North Carolina. The
Davidsonian is to be represented by J. E. Cassell and J. M. Gaston, and the Magazine by D. L. Mahood.
All three men will leave Davidson Friday and be gone for the weekend. Cassell informed the reporter that he does
not intend to make an address at this meeting. If theorganization can be perfected it is hoped that all the
college publications of the state can be of mutual benefit to each other, both in an editorial and managerial way.
Later on in the spring there will probably be a business meeting at which time some actual plans can be
formulated.
