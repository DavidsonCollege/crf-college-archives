### THE DAVIDSONIAN. ARTS & LIVING MONDAY, APRIL 18, 1994

#### Dubravka tickles the ivories

By Josh Larned

Dubravka Tomsic’s fingers danced across the piano with tremendous grace and self-assurance, as she focused intently upon interpreting the works of Ludwig van Beethoven and Frédéric Chopin to her enthralled audience. Such superb playing characterized the Slovenian pianist’s performance last Monday night in Hodson Hall. Given Ms. Tomsic’s world-wide renown, the performance, a rare treat for Davidson, was the final installment of the 1993-94 Davidson College Concert Series.

Tomsic ripped into her performance with a brilliant rendition of Beethoven’s “Les Adieux” (Sonata Op. 81a in E-flat major). Her powerful playing provided her listeners with unique introspection into the German composer’s adeptness at fusing together complex melodies with distinct feeling. She continued her interpretation of the master by easily performing the extremely intricate and melodic “Waldstein” (Sonata Op. 53 in C major). All in all, Tomsic’s accomplished playing gave the audience a fresh, “hands-on” approach to these familiar works by Beethoven.

However, as if things could not have been any more intense, Tomsic returned from a brief intermission to captivate her audience with Chopin’s Sonata Op. 35 in B-flat Major. With her strength and conviction on the piano, she conveyed in a dazzling rendition the powerful emotion that underlies and typifies the majority of the Polish composer’s works. For example, "Marche Funebre" was performed with such solemnity and sorrow, that the audience was rendered silent in their seats until the piece picked up with the final Presto. Tomsic concluded with Chopin’s Andante Spianato and Grand Polonaise Brillante, Op. 22.

Ms. Tomsic, a pianist of legendary stature in her native Slovenia and Eastern Europe, has accumulated numerous awards and accolades throughout her stunning career. She won the Brussels “Mozart Festival” International Composition (1967), the Zupancic Prize (1970), the Golden Lyre (1970), the Preseren Prize (1978), and the Gold Medal with “Ordre de Saint Fortunat” (Mainz, 1987). In addition, she has amassed over 40 recordings since 1987 alone.

According to senior music student Brett Palmer, “It was truly an amazing show.” Those who missed Ms. Tomsic last Monday night denied themselves a special opportunity to witness one of the world’s greatest contemporary pianists in action.

#### Gare Saint-Lazare Monet paintings differ from his garden works, Tucker says

Tucker continued from page 10

Used in Monet’s rendering of “instantaneity” on the canvas, the scholar asserted that Monet’s choice of subject is quite deliberate. One might believe that, since impressionism is concerned with painting how light reflects off of objects, Monet does not analyze the object itself or hold much concern for the choice of his subject. Tucker affirmed that “while his aesthetic choices are important—they should not overshadow the choices he makes concerning subject.” Tucker’s discussion of subject centered on Monet’s 1877 collection of the Gare Saint-Lazare—a train station in Paris, of which eight paintings were shown in the Third Impressionist Exhibition. Tucker explored Monet’s choice of subject and how the artist chose to confront modernity in an increasingly mechanized Paris.

According to Tucker, Monet’s painting of the Gare Saint-Lazare in 1877 says much about the artist. Monet as a landscape artist was faced with the modernist world in which he should choose a subject. Tucker found that Monet had put a great deal of thought into the care for detail in his rendering of the station, which was evident in his filling two entire sketchbooks with studies for his paintings. Appreciators of Monet often believe his paintings were spontaneous and lacked such deliberation and concern for detail.

Tucker explained the scientific and mechanistic discoveries which led up to the year in which Monet created the collection. Tucker discussed the modernization of Paris, as the surrounding countryside was annexed by the city. Monet, witnessing such changes, rendered a sign of the changing aspects of his time. The Gare Saint-Lazare paintings emphasized the modern use of iron, which Tucker called “God-child of the 19th century.” The U.S. had just completed the transcontinental railroad, and in Europe, and even in Japan the train was opening up trade routes and affecting the abilities for people to travel.

Monet captures the spirit of the reconstructive years following the Franco-Prussian War. The Gare Saint-Lazare built during this period, celebrates France’s return to normalcy. Finally, Tucker expressed that the painting mocked the traditional world through the use of chaotic, swirling smoke. Monet depicts a world that has “lost clarity and meaning.” Monet joins other artists of modern thought, forming the bridge between naturalistic painting and abstract art of the 20th century. According to Tucker, Monet abandons “the story-telling and narrative nature of earlier painting, therefore creating a more poetic canvas.” Monet’s painting had little to do with history, religion, or mythology, according to Tucker, but “evokes the heroism of modern existence.”

Paul Tucker is a professor of art history at the University of Massachusetts and has written two books on Monet: Monet in the 90s: The Series Paintings and Monet of Argenteuil. Tucker is currently working on his third book.
