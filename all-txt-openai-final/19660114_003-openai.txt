‘Cats Shine Against West Virginia... Freshmen Flog GW, The Citadel

The Wildkittens spread the scoring honors around in two games this week as they chalked up victories over Gardner-Webb, 100-79,
and The Citadel, 90-76.

Saturday at the Coliseum the Gardner-Webb team, reputed to be the best ever, failed to score until 16:55 was left
in the half, and the Wildkittens, led by Dave Moser, Mike Spann, and Mike Dickens, led 43-32 at the half.
The second half featured the play of Wayne Huckel, Chris Wood, and Tony Orsborn, who each had 11 points at
the end of the game. Six men hit in double figures with Spann high man with 16, Dickens second with
15, and Moser third with 14.

Tuesday night the lead see-sawed back and forth as the ‘Kittens finally pulled away from The Citadel freshmen late in
the second half. Five men hit in double figures as Wayne Huckel tallied 22 and Dave Moser hit for 20.
Huckel, once again drawing fouls, hit for 14 from the line. Mike Dickens and Mike Spann added offensive punches as
they chipped in 17 and 15 points, respectively. The final Davidson spurt came when the Bullpups switched to a full-court
press which brought about numerous fouls and allowed Huckel and Mike O'Neill to break loose for important field goals.

Saturday night the freshmen travel to Greenville, S.C., where they will face the Furman five. In the last meeting of
the two clubs, the Wildkittens came out on top, 102-78, in a game played in Davidson.

*Catfish Founder In USC’s Wake

University of South Carolina’s Gamecock swimmers grabbed top honors in nine of 11 events to crush their Davidson hosts, 62-33,
here Tuesday. Davidson sophomore Bris Rodgers won the 50-yard freestyle in 23.6 seconds for the ‘Cats’ only first place in
an individual event. The ‘Cats also copped the 400-yard freestyle relay with a time of 3:43.6 minutes. Swimming the event
for Davidson were John Helm, Paul Monk, Jim Stokes, and Rodgers.

The Gamecocks took the 400-yard medley relay in 4:05.9 to grab the opening lead. Carolina's Jim Kincaid then outdistanced Helm
in the 200-yard freestyle to widen the Gamecock lead. Gamecocks Bill Muller and Mike Lewis swept the top spots in
the 200-yard individual medley, while Carolinians Chick Lannehs (diving), John Pittenton (200-yard butterfly), and Dick Machata (100-yard freestyle) won their
events to put the meet on ice. South Carolina left the meet with a 2-1 record, falling to UNC while
registering wins over Davidson and feeble Duke. The ‘Cats now stand 2-2 for the season. Friday they host a team
from Emory here at 3:30 p.m. The visitors will be out to counter the shellacking they took last week at
the hands of Vanderbilt.

The ball ripped the cords with a swish. Manager Jim Hyder had just sunk a 40-footer at the buzzer. As
West Virginia Coach Bucky Waters put it, “I knew when he cocked his arm it was going in. It was
just that kind of a night.” Davidson had won 105-79. That shot made little difference in Coach Lefty Driesell’s 100th
college victory. But frustration was such for West Virginia fans that one West Virginia radio announcer remarked upon Hyder's first
attempt, “We were all pulling for him.”

Phil Squier started the rout with a jumper at 19:05, followed by Tom Youngdale’s jumper, another by Squier, and four
quick points by Rodney Knowles. Carl Head’s free throw at 16:33 put the Mounties on the scoreboard. An excellent Wildcat
defense kept them from connecting on a field goal until 15:25, as the offense built up a 14-4 lead at
that point.

Edge Surprising Citadel Squad, 81-77

Dick Snyder contributed another outstanding performance, scoring 35 points. Youngdale played his finest game of the season with 21 points
and a lot of hustle. Squier scored all of his 12 points in the first half and proved the sparkplug.
Bobby Lane contributed excellent defense and performed well, although he missed his first foul shots of the season after 36
straight.

Tuesday’s game was another story. The Citadel, losers of seven in a row, came to Johnston Gymnasium unimpressed with the
'Cats handling of West Virginia and kept the game in doubt throughout, losing only 81-77. Dick Snyder’s 38 points, 20
in the second half, spelled the difference. Knowles added 14. Although hitting on 59.6 percent of their shots, the Wildcats
disappointed Coach Driesell, who said, “We just didn’t take the shots we could have.” Bothered mostly by a pair of
hot-hitting guards, Wig Bauman and John DeBrosse, the ’Cats never led by more than ten points.

Squier Fills Unsung Hero’s Role

By CLIFF DUKE Davidsonian Sports Writer

Scan the preseason basketball magazines, read the scouting reports on each team, and you discover a few basic “facts” about
this Davidson team's prospects. Dick Snyder was to assume court leadership of the Wildcats, two tall sophomores—Rod Knowles and Tom
Youngdale—would supply the needed rebounding and Bobby Lane would prove to be outstanding. The unsung hero's role is left then
to Phil Squier. This you could not have known prior to the first toss-up of the season, either. While the
experts discussed other names as the Wildcats’ fifth man, Squier steadily ascended to the role. And despite having virtually no
more experience than the team’s heralded sophomores, his improving performances have made him a major asset to Davidson's success.

The slightly built Squier, a product of Newton, N.J., sifted through about 12 scholarship offers before coming to terms with
Davidson. He summed up his reasons by saying, “I visited down here during my senior year in high school, and
liked it very well. I was especially impressed by the student body.” So he matriculated here, and went on to
start on the Fred Hetzel-led freshman team. Squier dropped out of basketball, and out of school for a semester, due
to illness, but he returned to the hardcourt last year as a junior. However, he accrued little experience in scoring
1.5 points a game. Squier admits to this. “Last year I played very little, and this year is my first
playing on the point. Naturally, I feel very much like a sophomore.” Nevertheless, his floor play has steadied the young
Wildcats and sparked them to a 12-2 mark, with one game remaining.

IMAC Mulls Frosh Status

Commenting on the question of freshman eligibility

Grapplers Face Emory Matmen

Davidson’s Wildcat grapplers meet Emory University here on the home mats at 7 p.m. today. Last year Davidson almost shut
out the team from Decatur, Ga., but this year Emory is expected to be stronger competition. For Coach Charlie Parker’s
matmen, Johnny Webb, a Davidson senior, has returned from a year abroad and is expected to help in the 137
class. Joe Buffington, 123 pounder, and Bryan, heavyweight, will be trying to preserve their undefeated seasons. The meet Friday is
a varsity affair only. After Emory, the next meet is not until after the semester examinations when the competition will
continue.Cats meet such wrestling powers as N. C. State and Duke. A win Friday would break a two-meet losing streak
for Davidson and send them into the exam break with an even 2-2 mark.

On the court, Squier has developed into a steady dribbler and assist-maker. He has good hands and speed but would
like to improve his defense and shooting, although his occasional outside shots have helped loosen the opponent's defense. He has
not shot often—he averages 7 shots a game—but has hit for an eight-point average. This includes a season’s high of
17 points which he tallied against Furman.

In discussing the season, Squier made these comments: “We have been up and down, but it is hard to get
‘high’ for a game once in a while. We are gaining the confidence needed to carry us through, though. This
team is constantly improving, making fewer mistakes, and gaining confidence.

“Of course, Snyder is our only individual star, but everyone is learning to play better together. I think this group
has better teamwork than past Davidson teams. This we demonstrated best against West Virginia and Ohio University.

“I knew we could have a good season, but now we might just go on to win the tournament. And
if this is the first Driesell team to do so, its success can largely be attributed to Phil Squier's development
as the ‘unknown’ starter.”

AND LANE DRIVE BEATS SHAFFER

In Saturday’s 105-79 Crush, ’Cats Risk Spotless Mark In Family Feud At Furman

By MIKE MOOTY
Davidsonian Sports Writer

The Wildcats, boasting the only perfect record in the conference and a 12-2 overall mark, travel to Greenville, S.C., tomorrow
night to take on Furman’s Purple Paladins. The 'Cats had little trouble with Furman in an early season home game,
as Saturday, 105-79. This game is a must for West Virginia if their hopes for a conference title are to
remain alive.

In talking about the West Virginians, one of the ‘Cats observed, “They’re a lot better team than they showed last
week, and they'll be up for this one, to put it mildly. If we beat Furman, Wake, and West Virginia,
we should be in the top ten.”

Things could be a little rougher this weekend, however. Furman rarely has trouble getting up for the ‘Cats, especially in
Greenville. Also, ace guard Dan Goolsby, who saw little action against Davidson in their first meeting due to an injury,
has returned to the starting lineup.

After exams, Davidson travels to Greensboro to meet Wake Forest on Saturday, January 29. Playing in Charlotte, the Deacons squeaked
past the ‘Cats, 87-86, in the season’s opener. After this initial win, Wake lost several games but has shown steady
improvement in the past few weeks. Forwards Jim Boshardt and Newton Scott have joined Bob Leonard and Paul Long as
scoring threats, with Scott pouring in 21 points against Georgia Tech.

To be sure, however, Davidson has not forgotten that first loss, and as one of Coach Lefty Driesell’s boys stated,
“We should have the mental edge in that game.”

The ‘Cats then wind up their road stint Wednesday, February 2, against West Virginia in Charleston. Led by Snyder (35
points, 12 rebounds), Davidson handed the Mountaineers their only conference loss of the season last year.

Davidson’s “Unknown” Starter

POINTMAN PHIL SQUIER

To represent fraternities in intramural competition, IMAC president Tommy Hunter said, “Thursday in chapel we passed out to the freshmen
a questionnaire on the issue. With the aid of this information, the IMAC hopes to make a suitable recommendation to
the faculty committee on Fraternities and Social Life, the group which has the final say. As soon as we receive
their verdict, we'll begin the swimming, wrestling, and volleyball competition.”

Meanwhile, Wednesday afternoon's IMAC play saw the Betas take a forfeit from the Sigma Nu’s and the SAE’s trounce the
Independents. In Monday's action, Watts downed Cannon A 65-55, and Doug Rhymes and Dick Graham each chipped in 16 points
in a 45-38 Phi Gam victory over the KA’s. Rick Harrell contributed 16 points to the losing cause. Ernie Larkin
of the KA’s lamented, “We're 0-3 now, but we have the constant problem of being the good team that plays
just lousy enough to get beaten. We're also having a little difficulty manpower-wise.”

The Kappa Sigs continued their customary winning ways by slipping past the Pika five 17-54. A strangled gurgle was the
only Pika comment. The Sigma Chis likewise stayed in the winning column by turning back the Pi Kapps, 66-43, with
the help of 17 points from Joel Williamson and 14 points each from Basil Hicks and Tom Clayton. Said Pi
Kapp Jim Robinson, “We're doing better than we did last year, since we've already won two games. We're a little
short on height, though, and have been bothered by illness.”

The ATO’s copped their third victory against no losses by defeating a Phi Delt team described by Delt Ronnie Hunt
as ‘weaker than usual.’ Said Hunt, “John Fagg and Lindsey Collins are good on the boards, but overall we're short
on both height and organization.” For the ATO’s, Geoff Birkhead predicted, “We'll get better and better as the season goes
along since we'll gain experience at working together. I think we have the capacity to be a league leader.”

In other games last week, the Sigma Chis rolled over the Betas 71-40 and the SAE’s fell victim to the
Pikas 52-25, mainly as a result of Bryant Hinnant’s 26 points. The Pi Kapp-Sigma Nu game and the Sig Ep-Independent
contest were postponed.

NOTES...

Since Furman beat South Carolina (about the same degree of an upset as Wake Forest beating Davidson), it becomes rather
obvious that the Southern Conference is again capable of taking on and upsetting rivals in the stronger, richer Atlantic Coast
Conference. Furman’s win might also shed some light on the rather stale showing the ’Cats had against The Citadel the
night before the Furman-USC game.

South Carolina beat the nation’s number one team, the Duke Blue Devils, by two points; Furman beat South Carolina by
seven, and Davidson beat Furman by 20. Obviously, when you’re 29 points better than the number one team in the
nation, you’re not going to get too excited about playing a team that has lost seven straight.

Unquestionably, Davidson’s 105-97 victory over West Virginia rates as one of the finest performances ever by a Davidson basketball team.
Among other things, it:

- Was the most points scored by the Wildcats in any game so far this year (98 against Richmond is
second).
- Was the largest margin by which we have ever beaten a West Virginia team (103-80 last year was the
largest margin of victory).
- Was Coach Lefty Driesell’s 100th win in six seasons at Davidson. Only one other man has done this; from
1937-49 Coach N. Shepard won 170 games.
- Again put Davidson in a class all by itself in the Southern Conference.
- Should convince most skeptics that Davidson’s 1965-66 version of Wildcats are a power to be considered for national ranking,
despite their youthfulness.

Dick Snyder's 29.8 scoring average is high enough to be a new Davidson record, if he can hold it the
rest of the season. Last year Fred Hetzel set the mark with a 27.3 average.

If Bobby Lane can continue his 90.9 free throw percentage, another, older Davidson record would fall by the wayside. In
1957-58 Semi Mintz hit 88.2 percent of his shots from the foul line. His percentage is the second-best average in
NCAA history.

... AND QUOTES

Driesell on David Trusty’s son: “We'll play anybody, anywhere, at any time.”

Pete Glidewell on Jim Hyder’s West Virginia game-ending 40-foot shot: “The way we were hitting even I could have hit
that shot... even Sonny (Graves) could have made it.”
