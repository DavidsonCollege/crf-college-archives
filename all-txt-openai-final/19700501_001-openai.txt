ECOS Plans Fish Kill

By STEVE CROSS
Copy Editor

Tuesday's teach-in on environmental problems will open with a fish-killing on the porch of the College Union at 10 a.m.
A tank of fish will be set up and filled with polluted water from Rocky River. According to Pat Mullen,
organizer of the day's activities, this demonstration is designed to shock people into realizing the dimensions of the problem. He
added that old people in the area can remember swimming in Rocky River.

At 10:15 a.m., U.S. Rep. Nick Galifanakis will speak in the Morrison Room. Galifanakis, sponsor of several anti-pollution bills in
the U.S. House of Representatives, is being sponsored by Pi Kappa Phi social fraternity. Galifanakis is speaking free of charge;
the fraternity is putting up only his traveling allowance.

At 2 p.m. in the Morrison Room, a film made by the National Wildlife Federation, "So Little Time," will be
shown. According to Mullen, the film is regarded as one of the best on the subject ever made.

SLC Report May Suggest Easier Drug Enforcement

By JOHN McLEAN
Managing Editor

The Student Life Committee may propose that the College ease its methods of enforcement against drug offenses. The SLC has
discussed alternatives to punishment for drug abuse, specifically counseling measures before and after conviction.

Reports from the SLC, which is evaluating the Code of Responsibility, indicate that the committee will soon decide between two
alternate wordings which would amend the Code’s prohibition on "harmful drugs." The committee is reportedly leaning toward a softer stand
and will probably recommend dropping from the Code the statement: "Therefore the College will not tolerate the medically unsupervised use,
or distribution or possession of any of these drugs." Deleting this phrase will not have the effect of "legalizing" drugs
on campus, but will only make enforcement against illegal drug usage or possession more flexible.

SLC members were reluctant to discuss specific ideas discussed in committee, but they said privately that there is a feeling
within the committee and the administration that legalities involved with drug enforcement are too cumbersome to be handled conveniently. The
SLC was charged by College President Samuel R. Spencer Jr. to evaluate the Code and make its recommendations to the
Board of Trustees, which is scheduled to re-examine the Code at its meeting next fall. Most members of the SLC
favor continuing the Code, which is the legal basis for student-faculty relations and the social life of students.

Next week the SLC will begin hearings on the fraternity question. Spencer had asked the committee to present alternatives to
the fraternity system as presently constituted. All actions of the SLC on the Code are merely advisory to the trustees
and to a special six-member committee which has the sole power to propose amendments to the Code.

Professor Questions U.S. Cambodian Involvement

By W. E. JACKSON JR.
Asst. Prof. of Pol. Science

These lines are written before the President's speech of Thursday night. Buckets of rhetoric will be thrown upon the American
people, rationalizing a policy of expanded intervention in Indochina and salving our collective conscience. We will be told that the
way to bring the boys home quicker from Vietnam is to carry the war into Cambodia. We will be told
that external aggression has occurred in that little country, directed by Communists. We will be told that the new military
government in Phnom Penh is part of the free world in an area covered by SEATO, etc., and we must
help defend it. In short, we will be subjected to propaganda by the President of the United States to justify
an expansion of our role in the war.

This much is known about the Nixon Administration's course of action. The U.S. government is providing military advisers, bombing strikes
(possibly with B-52's), and other support for a major South Vietnamese attack upon North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces operating
in Cambodia. The attack was first announced by the South Vietnamese Defense Ministry in Saigon and later confirmed by the
Pentagon. Department of Defense officials termed the action "a necessary and effective measure to save American and other free world
lives and to strengthen the Vietnamization program." The stated objective of the South Vietnamese attack is to "destroy an extensive
complex of North Vietnamese and V.C. bases and depots in Cambodian territory."

Several questions must be raised rapidly and forcefully about the Administration’s decision. What specific commitment does the U.S. have to
the defense of Cambodia?

‘Outside Pressure’ Chief

AN ANALYSIS

By ED SHOAF
Editor-in-Chief

ED. NOTE: This is the second in a series of four articles on "Fraternities in Crisis."

As far as fraternities are concerned, the Sixties were a decade of outside threats and reluctance to change. If nothing
else, the past decade has proved the futility of the cry for change from within the system.

Cry for fraternity reform was not long in coming after Davidson had greeted the new decade. In March of 1960,
the faculty began to become concerned about the relationship between pledge training and freshman academic performance. The Interfraternity Council (IFC)
and the faculty Fraternity Committee began to consider the question, and on May 3, the faculty overwhelmingly voted to require
sophomore rush beginning with the class of 1966.

Part of the faculty’s decision was based on concern over a large number of men who had gone inactive during
the first or the second semester in 1960. In spite of this apparent sentiment, however, 521 out of 732 fraternity
members expressed their opposition to the ruling in a petition to the faculty the next week.

In the fall of 1961, business continued as usual with 81 percent of the freshmen pledging fraternities in the first
week of school.

Within two weeks, three fraternity men presented the IFC with a plan opposing the faculty move of the previous spring.
Students, they claimed, were mature enough to solve their own problems without sophomore rush. The plan liberalized pledging by prohibiting
"actual hazing," as well as "stud or laundry running, shoe shining, car washing or other personal services; forced eating, calisthenics
and any other objectionable requirements."

The fraternities rejected the proposal by a nine to three vote saying that it took away too much of the
control over pledges. A revised plan was rejected on Oct. 14, 1960, but by November the IFC had a plan
which it could submit to the faculty. On Dec. 9, the faculty agreed to postpone the institution of sophomore rush
for a year to test the IFC rules on hazing.

With the start of 1962, the question of social life for the Independents again came to the fore of faculty
discussion. The result was the organization of Lingle Manor on May 4. By the next year, the Manor had 57
members.

On Nov. 9, 1964, the college administration brought the questions back to life with a challenge to the fraternities to
help those 27 percent of the student body who had been rejected from fraternities. Charging that fraternity willingness to change
was ephemeral and only surfaced in times of direct threat, administration member Bob Young suggested one hundred percent bidding or
sophomore rush as possible solutions to the problem.

The fraternities argued back that they were not responsible for the stigma on rejected people in that since they cared
for 73 percent of the students, the college should handle the rest. They also argued that pledge projects were beneficial
and that freshmen needed the fraternity social life.

A student body committee was set up to consider the questions. In Mar. 1965, a report was returned which recommended
delayed rush, the establishment of local eating clubs, setting up a campus-wide social council to handle former IFC booking duties,
and restricting fraternity membership to juniors and seniors. Minority reports continued to favor fraternities.

Then on Apr. 13, 1965, the faculty rejected all committee reports and ruled that no rush of any kind would
be allowed until the second semester of the freshman year.

Spencer Meets Students; No Action

---**Promised Yet On Course Credits Dispute**

By JOHN McLEAN

Between the shift from the old curriculum to the Blue Sky curriculum, College President Samuel R. Spencer Jr. and Registrar
Jay H. Ostwalt met with concerned students and faculty Monday night to iron out differences over recently rejected Student Curriculum
Committee (CRC) graduation appeals.

Senior David, leader of the students’ Ad Hoc Committee for the Protection of Students, asked Ostwalt to show how it
was fair for those summer school courses not to be counted toward graduation. The controversy arises primarily from confusion in
converting “semester hours” to “courses.” The rule in question states that at the time of the curriculum shift, anyone having
58 to 72 hours would be required to complete 16 courses to graduate. Students with less than 72 hours took
the summer of 1968, apparently thinking that credits would apply against the 16-course requirement and not simply be added below
the 72-hour line.

Ostwalt and the GRC ruled that those courses would only build toward the 72-hour figure, hence yielding no graduation credit.
Ostwalt pointed out that the 58-hour line was generous to those who were behind schedule academically at the curriculum shift.
But paradoxically, the same summer school course taken in 1968 for no credit would yield credit if taken in 1969.

Senior Dick Allison challenged Ostwalt to show who would suffer by granting credit for the courses. Neither Ostwalt nor any
other administration official offered a reply. Ostwalt maintained that there should have been no confusion because it was clearly stated
that the Blue Sky curriculum would take effect in September, not June. He could not provide any written notice to
that effect dated before September, and several students said that this had not been made plain.

Several faculty members present vowed that the summer school credit issue was not plain at the time, and at least
one CRC member intimated that the ambiguity of interpretation would justify reconsideration in the CRC.

**MARA LOVES**

Singing of cities and of love, the Canadian folk group “Mara Loves” arrived at the Hungry I Tuesday night where
they will entertain coffeehouse audiences twice nightly through Saturday.

**Foster Explains New Draft Rule**

Col. Virgil P. Foster, professor of military science, has requested clarifying information from Washington concerning President Nixon's proposed legislation which
would allow the President to eliminate deferments. Foster said that, as he understood it, the proposed legislation (if passed) and
the forthcoming executive order would permit deferments only for undergraduate students who are enrolled in ROTC. Those with physical disabilities
precluding active duty would not be affected.

Foster also brought out the interesting question, as yet unanswered, of whether those who drop out of ROTC now and
lose their 1-D deferment will be granted a 2S deferment after reverting to 1-A. In addition to eliminating deferments as
of Apr. 23, the President had proposed legislation that would grant him authority to eliminate student deferments at his discretion.
He stated that upon its passage, he would in fact eliminate student deferments retroactive to Apr. 23, 1970. The order
would not affect present 2S deferments requested as of Apr. 23, but not processed. Although details were not available, the
Charlotte draft board said that it had received a telegram halting the granting of any new 2-A deferments.

**Cause Of Social Reform**

In the year 1965-1966, the faculty ruled that all campus organizations must show proof that any student was eligible to
become a member, regardless of race or religion, or the group must disband. Finally, the faculty ruled that two more
fraternity houses would be built as non-selective eating clubs if groups could be found desiring them.

Fraternity response to these moves was one of outrage. Seniors threatened to boycott required chapels and vespers. Two days later,
about half the student body engaged in a torchlight parade of protest over the action. The students called for the
ouster of Assistant Dean of Students Bob Jones, who they felt was most responsible for the action. President D. Grier
Martin dissipated the parade by urging that students seek other means of protest.

Meeting on Apr. 30, the Board of Trustees reinstated rush on a delayed basis in the first semester of the
freshman year. They too vowed to provide any interested eating group with a house similar to the fraternity houses. In
the fall of 1965, rush was delayed until Oct. 30. New studies of the situation were set up. Acting on
the recommendation of the faculty Social Life Evaluation Committee, the faculty on Feb. 22, 1966 ruled that in the 1967-68
year, rush would be held second semester, a total affiliation plan would be used, and the freshmen would eat in
the Union all year long.

Complying with the faculty rules, the IFC drew up a social affiliacy plan in Mar. 1967. The plan would allow
freshmen not receiving a bid to visit several houses as social affiliates. This plan was approved by the faculty. Also,
the faculty urged the establishment of another social group for the campus. A group of Independents began to form the
“Campus Club” and were told that a new house would be built for them if they could collect 40 paying
members.

Meanwhile, the national chapters of Davidson's fraternities began to protest over the social affiliation plan. After meetings in the spring
and fall of 1967, the nationals were satisfied by the adoption of the present extended rush program. Also, in Sept.
1967, the Campus Club had secured 35 members and sought to obtain a house from the college. The College, however,
refused to act on the request, presumably because 40 members had not been exhibited.

More study of the fraternity system was completed in 1969 with the conclusion of study by the Spencer Commission on
Social Patterns. This commission recommended in the majority that fraternities be divorced of their eating facilities, stating that the institutional
fraternities had no place on the Davidson campus. A trend toward campus-wide social life with the residence halls as its
center was encouraged by the commission. Again, a minority report dissented from the anti-fraternity sections of the commission report.

The 1969-1970 school year has also seen the failure of an attempt by a group of students at the Sigma
Chi house to form a local fraternity. More recently, fraternities have been under fire for the instances cited in the
first article of the series. However, no changes in the system have occurred since 1967.

Yet in retrospect, today’s fraternities are quite different than those of 1960. How did this change occur? It seems clear
from the record that change came only as an immediate effort to protect the system from serious and threatening pressure
from the outside.

Next week: a look at fraternity problems on a nationwide scale.
