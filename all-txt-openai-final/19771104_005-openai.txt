#### Wong Irving and Van Winkle Come Home
By SUE FIELDS ROSS

When Washington Irving returned to America in 1832 after seventeen years abroad, it was almost as if he were reliving the experiences of Rip Van Winkle, a character he had presented to the world thirteen years earlier. An unpublished journal which Irving kept during August 1832, only four months after his return to his native land, suggests that in the case of Irving and Rip, life was imitating art.

Even though Irving was the best-known native American writer of the day, he was nervous about his “reentry” into American life. Sydney Smith’s question in the January 1820 Edinburgh Review, “In the four quarters of the globe who reads an American book?” was unfortunate in its timing, as the popularity in England of the author of *The Sketch Book* (1819) rivaled Sir Walter Scott’s. Even so, we sense Irving’s trepidation about his countrymen’s feelings when we read in an 1820 letter to his friend Henry Brevoort, “What I would not give for a few days among the Highlands of the Hudson, with the little knot that was once assembled there! But I shall return home and find all changed, and shall be made sensible how much I have changed myself. It is this idea which continually comes across my mind, when I think of home, and I am continually picturing to myself the dreary state of a poor devil like myself, who, after wandering about the world among strangers, returns to find himself a still greater stranger in his native place.”

By 1827 Irving was sensitive about the criticism of his countrymen, and he wrote to Brevoort, “I must confess that for a time I gave too much consequence to the attacks I had seen upon myself in the press and to anonymous letters which I received from some malevolent person seeking to persuade me that I was in a manner cast off by my countrymen. I am conscious that my long absence from home has subjected me to unfavorable representation, and has been used to my disadvantage... Do not let yourself be persuaded therefore that time or distance has estranged me in thought or feeling from my native country, my native places, or the friends of my youth.”

In the introduction to the American edition of *A Tour on the Prairies* (1835), Irving confesses publicly and poignantly his fear of returning to America in 1832 and his bewilderment that Americans could have ever doubted his patriotism. In any case, Irving returned to America in April 1832 and found his friends faithful, his public enthusiastic, and his country changed.

There are interesting parallels in Irving's and Rip’s experiences. Before Rip fell asleep for twenty years, he had demonstrated an “insuperable aversion to all kinds of profitable labor;” before going to England, Irving’s indulgent family and success with *Knickerbocker’s History of New York* (1809) enabled him to enjoy fully the good life. It was during the difficult years in England after suffering business losses that Irving turned again to his pen for livelihood.

When Rip awoke from his twenty-year nap, he first discovered his gun rusty, his dog gone, and his joints stiff. Next, he noticed that the people in town were strangers, the dogs barked at him, his beard was long, his house was in ruins, but the mountains and the Hudson River had endured. It is interesting that soon after Irving’s return to America, he embarked on a trip described by a traveling companion as “an excursion up the Hudson River, and to the Katskill Mountains, lingering for a few days by the way, in a delightful retreat, in the bosom of the Highlands.” Perhaps Irving, like Rip, was comforted by nature’s constants.

One of the most drastic changes for Rip Van Winkle was the political. Rip noticed a change in the flag, now a “singular assemblage of stars and stripes;” the red coat of King George was now one of blue and buff, and the sceptre had become a sword. Rip answered the confusing question of whether he was a Federalist or Democrat by asserting that he was “a poor quiet man, a native of the place, and a loyal subject of the King, God bless him!” The townspeople shout accusingly, “a Tory! a spy!” Irving felt that his long absence from his homeland, the choice of European topics for his writing, and his favorable critical reception abroad had prompted the slander that he was “alienated in heart from (his) country.” It must have been a joyous relief that Irving’s homecoming was more pleasant than Rip’s. However, he did find America very different politically: Irving had left his country in 1815, immediately after the War of 1812 and during the presidential term of James Madison. After an interval in America of what some historians call an “era of good feeling,” which included a friendlier attitude toward Great Britain, the prevailing negative attitude of many Englishmen toward anything American prevented an easy relationship from developing. When Irving returned, Andrew Jackson had been elected and Jacksonian Democracy was the political stance of the day. Even Rip, after finding many of the leaders of the town dead, did rediscover many old cronies, but he “preferred making friends among the rising generation, with whom he soon grew into great favor.” DeTocqueville had written in 1831 that the old great race of American men—men of culture, talent, character who had given this country the Declaration of Independence and a new democracy—was disappearing. Henry Ellsworth, with whom Irving traveled west, wrote that Irving disliked “political or polemic discussions” and...That with "the great, he feels sufficiently acquainted—He desires most to ramble among the natural actions of men." Yet Irving’s journal, while it recounts visits with many of his old friends, reveals that Irving met and talked with men active in the current political life of New York state, men such as Senator William Learned Marcy, a member of the "Albany Regency" and soon to be the Democratic Party’s candidate for governor of New York. Irving visited with Governor Throop of New York, Governor Duncan McArthur of Ohio, and later with General William Henry Harrison, to cite only a few.

Finally, on his reentry into local society, Rip had to get reacquainted with his family. He had left behind his wife, the incorrigible Dame Van Winkle, as well as a son and daughter. Rip found his son grown and indolent—a copy of Rip’s younger self—and his loving daughter comfortably married and the mother of his grandson Rip. Even though Irving was a bachelor, he was a devoted family man. One very human touch revealed in this recently "discovered" 1932 journal is the fact that during a visit with members of his immediate family, Irving, so long absent from the extended family, systematically listed at the end of the journal all of his relatives by family groups. Rip settled down to live a happy life in the bosom of his daughter’s family and among the friendly townspeople.

After his trip west, Irving bought land at Tarrytown, built Sunnyside, and lived and wrote happily among family and friends for the remaining 27 years of his life (with the exception of the four years, 1842-1846, which he spent in Spain as Minister to Madrid). It must have been a comfort to Irving that his coming home had been as pleasant as Rip’s and that in this case life seemed to imitate art.

Should we give away the Canal?

To the Editor:

I write in response to the column "Panama Canal’s fate lies with us," in The Davidsonian, Oct. 28, 1977. There were a number of inaccurate statements made in the article that I would like to comment on. First of all, to say "we stole it fair and square" is an exaggeration. Granted, the 1903 treaty is advantageous to the U.S., but it must be said that it was overwhelmingly supported by Panamanians when it was signed. It has since been modified several times to benefit Panama. The fact is that Panama’s chief source of income is the canal. Contrary to Ms. Sawada’s contention that "the revenues of her geographical resource do not return to her," revenues from the canal are channeled into Panama through employment, work projects, and business given to Panamanian merchants by American military and canal personnel, just to name a few. Tourism, Panama's second source of income, is generated by the canal. The bulk of the wealth in Panama is in the hands of a few business people who have as much as said that if the Americans leave the Zone, they will take their money out of Panama.

One statement said, "Somehow we don’t realize the amount of friction present between the American community living in the Canal Zone and the Panamanians." I am curious as to what Ms. Sawada bases this statement on. I have dared to venture into Panama City and into the interior of the country and have been received openly and without hostility by the Panamanians I met. To my knowledge, this is the experience of other Canal Zone residents. The alleged friction lies in the hands of a few radical factions in Panama.

The reference to the 1964 riots is also incorrect. The incident was triggered when Panamanian students attempted to raise a Panamanian flag in place of the American flag. When American high school students moved to stop them, fighting broke out. In all, 22 Panamanians were killed. 21 of them were in the process of looting Panamanian stores and were shot by Panamanian National Guardsmen.

It is true that Panamanians fill eighty percent of the jobs required for the operation of the canal. It is not true that they are kept from occupying higher positions. This employment amounts to thousands of Panamanians earning salaries far above Panamanian standards, resulting in a large flow of money into an economy that has sunk steadily since Omar Torrijos took power.

The neutrality treaty is a farce. It is nothing more than a device to help President Carter sell the treaty to opponents. Recent revelations have also shown that Panama’s interpretation of this treaty is vastly different from the American interpretation.

Lastly, I would like to comment on what Ms. Sawada calls "the real issue of the self-determination of the people of Panama." Self-determination is an unknown entity in Panama. There are no rights, human nor civil. There are no free elections. Since Torrijos came to power, numerous radio stations and newspapers have been shut down. All media are government-controlled. Opposition to the government is quickly and brutally suppressed by the G-2, Panama’s version of the KGB. Self-determination will never be achieved as long as Torrijos is in power, regardless of what happens with the treaties. We would be doing a grave injustice to the people of Panama if we solidified the position of the Torrijos regime by giving him the canal.
