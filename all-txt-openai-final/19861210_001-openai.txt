**Davidson granted extension in Southern Conference**

By EDWIN PAGE

On Dec. 5, the Southern Conference executive board approved a one-year membership extension for Davidson. The vote was 7-0 for the proposal, with Appalachian State and Western Carolina abstaining.

The extension allows the Cats to compete for Southern Conference championships in all sports except football and women’s basketball for another academic year. According to J.B. Stroud, Davidson’s faculty representative on the executive board, the groundwork for the extension was laid at a previous meeting. Stroud said that a consensus was reached at this meeting and that last Friday’s action by the executive board was a “rubber stamp” approving the earlier decision.

The move is apparently a one-year-only proposal. Stroud said, “We will request no further extension of Southern Conference membership unless the institution is prepared to commit itself to full compliance with all conference requirements.” This would mean reinstating the women’s basketball team and playing full-time in the conference during football season, both of which seem extremely unlikely at the present time.

Plans for the extension began in September when the executive board denied Davidson’s appeal for a waiver of the requirements to play football and women’s basketball. That denial left Davidson less than a year to come up with a new conference to affiliate with. The extension allows the Cats another year to search without having to face the prospect of becoming independent.

Currently, Davidson is actively pursuing the possibility of affiliating with the Colonial Athletic Association. The CAA is a basketball-oriented conference that does not require football participation. Kit Morris said of the CAA, “It’s the only conference we’ve had conversations with. Other conferences have pursued us, but my own inclination is that the Colonial Athletic Association is the one that makes the most sense for us. I think we’re a good fit. We’ve been affiliated with three of those schools in the past and we’re stronger in the areas we need to be strong in than we have been in the past ten years.”

Although the CAA has publicly stated that it is not interested in expanding at this time, Morris remains optimistic about Davidson’s chances.

**Fire alarm policy being negotiated**

By JIM DILLON

Negotiations are currently going on between campus police, the Davidson Fire Department, and the college regarding the fire alarm policy, according to Dean of Students Will Terry.

In mid-October, the Davidson Fire Department asked to be called whenever a fire alarm went off. Since the fire department has taken over the operation of turning off alarms, the department must come to the campus, make sure there is no fire, and evacuate the building before an alarm can be turned off. Davidson police have no authority to declare a false alarm and cannot turn alarms off until the fire department gives its okay.

Before this plan took effect, Davidson police were able to declare a false alarm and turn the alarms off. Evacuations were not necessary in the case of false alarms.

Housing Director Tom Jennings says the system is likely to change again. Campus police will once again have the authority to turn the alarms off in the event of a false alarm, but Davidson must be responsible for the evacuation of students from dormitories.

“My guess is that we’re going to change again,” Jennings said. “We’re going to try to do the evacuations by getting hall counselors, resident assistants, and the police to knock on doors when an alarm goes off. We’re not going to ask them to risk their lives in the event of a fire, but if the police are going to be able to turn the alarms off again, we have to take responsibility for evacuations.”

Jennings said it is possible that fines will be charged to students who do not leave their dormitories when a fire alarm sounds. He said a decision regarding punishment for those students will be reached between him and Terry.

Belk Dormitory has caused the most problems recently, according to Jennings. During one three-week period this year, alarms went off 18 times and sounded for as long as 45 minutes before being turned off by the fire department.
