Friday, November 7, 1947 THE DAVIDSONIAN Page Three COMMENTS ON AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY CONDITIONS By PROF. E. 0. GUERRANT

Former Secretary of State James F. Byrnes noted in his recent book, Speaking Frankly, the remarkable continuity in British foreign policy at the time of the Potsdam Conference when Ernest Bevin replaced Anthony Eden as foreign minister. There are a number of reasons for the consistency of British policy in contrast to the many fluctuations in American policy that have tended to vitiate our influence abroad. The British have a permanent under-secretary of foreign affairs, a position filled by a career diplomat who normally occupies that post for a long period of time. Lord Vansittart, who resigned several years ago, was under-secretary for a number of years. While the under-secretary can always be overruled by the prime minister or foreign minister, the British Foreign Office has the great advantage of being able to secure the advice of a high-ranking expert in foreign affairs who remains in office through several administrations. There is nothing comparable to that system in this country. Within the last three years, we have had four secretaries of state, several under-secretaries, about twenty different assistant secretaries of state, and innumerable assistants to the assistant secretaries.

There is no officer on the policy-making level within the Department of State now who was there three years ago. The result has been confusion within the department and fluctuating foreign policy.

Another difference between the British Foreign Office and the American State Department has been the calibre of men who have chosen to make government service a career. Britain has been a major world power for the last three hundred years, and this is due partially to the fact that the British foreign service has for centuries attracted some of the best minds in that nation. The United States became a world power during World War I but the nation as a whole didn’t realize it until World War II. Capable and well-trained young men in this country have turned to business or the professions in preference to government service, and our foreign policy has suffered accordingly. During the war, this government was forced to draw upon business and professional leaders to an unprecedented degree in order to operate more efficiently. Nelson A. Rockefeller and William C. Clayton are examples of business leaders who for a time served as assistant and under-secretaries of state. William Langer of Harvard University held a high position in the Office of Strategic Services and later in the Department of State. William Benton of the University of Chicago served for a time as assistant secretary of state but resigned recently after Congress had slashed the appropriations in his department to a point where he felt his services could no longer be effective. One of the present under-secretaries of state, Robert Lovett, reluctantly left his business in New York to assist Secretary Marshall during this critical period. Leo Pasvolsky, one of the most capable men in the department who served as special adviser to Cordell Hull and Ed-

Once a month Vhi Mu also sponsors a miniature recital to some student here. These will be given in Chambers Auditorium at a tentative hour of 9:15 p.m. This will give all the grinds a chance to relax from their work for fifteen minutes to half an hour. These will be announced in THE DAVIDSONIAN.

Much Recent Thought

Within the last few years a great deal has been written about the formulation and implementation of American policy and a number of suggestions have been made toward bringing the State Department and the Foreign Service up to date. Among the more recent suggestions are the following: (1) The Policy Planning Committee, now under the direction of George Kennan, should be retained as a permanent part of the State Department. Not until a few months ago when Mr. Kennan, one of the most brilliant officers in the foreign service who had served for a number of years as the counselor of the American Embassy in Moscow, was made chairman of this body was there any group within the department whose duties were to plan long-range policy. Until that time there was no systematic attempt within the department to correlate our policy toward the entire world. For instance, the assistant secretary of state in charge of Latin American affairs would follow a policy toward Argentina or Brazil without correlating it with what we were attempting to do in China or India. This Kennan group is designed to plan a co-
