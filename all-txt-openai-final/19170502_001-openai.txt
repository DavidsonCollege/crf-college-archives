THEDAVI. Vol. IV.

Many Davidson Men Take Officers’ Exam.

Davidson will furnish her full quota to the Officers’ Training Camp at Fort Oglethorpe this summer. Already a large number have signified their desire to enlist. Those men who have made application and who went to Charlotte Monday to stand the final test before an Army officer are: A. C. Wood, R. D. Walker, B. D. Roddey, R. C. Jones, D. M. Therrell, L. M. Johnson, B. N. White, N. L. Armistead, J. C. Paisley, J. B. Pharr, H. B. Fraser, R. T. Carroll, J. L. Fountain, S. R. Keesler, W. P. Keesler, S. M. Crisp, J. M. Black, and H. F. Mayfield. Several others have applied but found it impossible to go to Charlotte Monday. They will be passed upon some time this week. The camp will open at Fort Oglethorpe May 14. Several men enlisted last week in the Coast Artillery division. Military drill is still characterized by the same readiness and enthusiasm of the students. No diminishing in the number drilling has been noticed as yet. The two separate companies are being put through the finer points of squad movement. The desire of the student officers is to give a general knowledge of drill movements to those students participating by commencement. Whether compulsory military drill is adopted at Davidson will depend upon the faculty and the War Department. Nothing definite will be known for some time.

FULL COMMENCEMENT EXERCISES TO BE HELD

It was the plan of the faculty that on account of the existing state of war, the Commencement exercises should be much simpler this year than usual, and all unnecessary social functions should be left off. The Senior class, which has been waiting during these four years for Commencement, decided to petition the faculty that the usual program be followed. The faculty finally decided that the regular Commencement shall be held except for the fact that the exercises will begin on Saturday night with the meeting of the societies, and close Tuesday at noon with the Senior speeches and the awarding of the diplomas. In other words, the Commencement exercises will be the same as usual, only they will not last as long as heretofore.

STEEL FLAG POLE TO BE ERECTED SOON

Davidson is to have a steel flag pole. The sections of timber secured for the pole have been found defective. Much shaping and dressing only went to prove them unfit for a permanent flag pole. The Senior class, donator of the pole to the college, and the faculty, decided that a steel flag pole would be better and more lasting. It is being made at Charlotte now. This steel flag pole will be 115 feet high, with reversible top and wire ropes for the raising or lowering of a 30-foot flag. The concrete base foundation will not be altered. Owing to a slight delay, the flag pole, due to have arrived last week, will not be raised till the last of the week.

GOOD WEATHER HELPS WORK ON GYMNASIUM

The foundation for the new gym is being rapidly pushed forward. When the laying of brick began last Tuesday, all doubts as to its reality faded away. The making of mortar and the wielding of the trowel suggest completion and a finished gym by fall. Good weather conditions have aided the workmen the past week, and the progress has been satisfying. Plumbing for the sewerage is being roughed into the foundation. The work on the foundation will continue throughout the week.

Georgia Defeated In Pitchers’ Duel

Last Game of Season is Won By Red and Black.

Davidson closed her abbreviated but successful baseball season on last Wednesday at Sprunt Field, defeating the strong University of Georgia team by a score of 2-1. The game was by far the fastest and most exciting exhibition staged on the local field this year and was indeed a fitting climax to the 1917 season. The game was a pitcher's battle between Hengeveld and Satterfield. The former was in his best form, allowing but two hits, and but for an error would have scored a shut-out victory. After the first inning, when an error, coupled with an infield hit and a single by Wooten, resulted in a tally, the big Dutchman was more than effective. Satterfield, for the Georgians, showed splendid stuff and struck out eight of the Davidson hitters, but bunched hits in two innings proved his downfall. Having failed to tie the score in the first inning, Davidson came back strong in the second. McMillan, the first man up, tripled over the right fielder’s head. Satterfield’s curves were too much for Singleton, and he struck out. Saunders singled sharply to center and McMillan scored. This ended Davidson's scoring until the eighth, when Hengeveld singled, took second on Johnson's sacrifice, went to third on Black’s single, and scored on a single by McKinnon. Both teams played good ball in the field, Georgia going through the contest errorless. Davidson made several misplays, but only one proved costly. Rawson caught an especially nice game for Georgia. Saunders accepted 14 chances without an error for Davidson. The feature of the afternoon in the slugging line was McMillan’s three-bagger. The box score and summary follows:
