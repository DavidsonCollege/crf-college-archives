Flickerball IMAC faces finals

By Jonathan Whitcomb
IMAC flickerball finals are
upon us. We’ve seen freshmen
struggle with the concepts, and then
some master the game. But on Sun-
day, six teams will enter and only
three will come out as champions.
In women’s flickerball, the Rusk
house will face the Awesome Base-
ments. Rusk, which came out of
the winner’s bracket, has to be
considered the favorite, although
the Awesome Basements has
shown a lot of toughness by sur-
viving the loser’s bracket.

In male B league flickerball,
which consists of freshmen halls,
Basement Belk is represented for
the second year in a row against the
young men from 2nd East. The
importance of this game lies in the
fact that neither side will forget the
outcome for the duration of their
life at Davidson. Finally, in the
elite league of flickerball competi-
tion, a strong SAE team faces a
conglomeration of seniors who
play under the name, Mad Dawg.
We can only hope they don’t play
like they’ve drank it. Mad Dawg
took a 35-25 victory in the first
game and the two teams will play
for all the marbles this afternoon.
Good luck to all the competitors.
