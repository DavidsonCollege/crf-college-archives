DAVIDSONIAN SPORTS MONDAY, JANUARY 20, 1997

The Week Ahead

Men’s Hoops:
Tonight @ Appalachian St. (7:30)
Preseason SC ranking: 4th, North Division
Coach: Buzz Peterson (first year)
Current record: 7-9 (2-2 SC)
Last meeting: Feb. 10, 1996 - DC, 84-66
Players to watch: Kareem Livingston (6-7, Jr., F, 12.4 ppg*, 4.8 rpg, 62.3 FG%), Junior Braswell (6-1, Sr., G, 17.9

Notes: Livingston, who is 11th in the nation in field goal percentage this week (63%), was a unanimous preseason all-conference
selection and one of only three players who received a Player-of-the-Year vote. His shooting clip is tops in the SC...
Braswell, no relation to Wake Forest guard Jerry Braswell, was second team preseason all-league. He also posted the school’s first
and only triple-double in a conference quarterfinal loss to Western Carolina... Coach Peterson claimed North Carolina player and athlete of
the year honors as a senior in high school, beating out a guy named Michael Jordan. He was then His
Airness’ teammate and roommate at Carolina.

Preseason SC ranking: 5th, North Division
Coach: Ed DeChellis (first year)
Current record: 4-10 (0-3 SC)
Last meeting: Mar. 1, 1996 - DC, 67-43 (SC quarters)
Players to watch: Kyle Keeton (5-11, So., G, 11.5 ppg, 40.4% 3-pts), Titus Shelton (6-4, Jr., F)
The Sporting News on the Buccaneers: “The program has a good tradition. But tradition won’t win games this season.”
DeChellis on his Bucs: “The cupboard is bare. I lay awake at night wondering how we are going to score.”
Notes: Only one starter, Shelton, returns from a team that went 7-20, 3-11 last year... ETSU ranks last in the
SC in scoring (59.5 ppg), scoring margin (-12.2), field goal percentage defense (49.6%), free throw percentage (61.6%), blocked shots (1.4
bpg), rebounding margin (-3.8), and 3-pointers per game (4.1)... Rookie big men Gareth Davis (6-9) and Courtney Simpkins (6-8) bolster
what was a dismal inside game in 1995-96... Troy Seymour (6-3, Jr. G) was 15th in the country last week
in 3-point shooting at 52.4%.

Women’s Hoops:
Tonight vs. Georgia Southern (7:30)
Preseason SC ranking: 4th
Coach: Rusty Cram (first year)
Record: 7-9 (1-3 SC)
Last meeting: Feb. 17, 1996 - GSU, 100-97 (OT)

apg, 2.4 spg)
Filar on the Eagles: “They are the quickest team in the conference and very dangerous from the outside. They love
to run, so it should be an up-tempo game. They are also very experienced. It should be a challenging matchup.”
Notes: The Lady Eagles return four starters from a team that went 15-13 and advanced to the conference semis last
year... they shoot the ball from the field at a 38% rate, good for last in the SC... Askew recently
passed the 1,000-point plateau for her career... Svetlana Trjeskal has established herself as one of the conference’s premier deep threats,
leading the league with 23 three-pointers made and a 34.7% shooting percentage.

Saturday @ East Tenn. St. (3:00)
Preseason SC ranking: 5th
Coach: Karen Kemp (third year, 30-26 overall at ETSU)
Record: 8-8 (1-3 SC)
Last meeting: Feb. 22, 1996 - DC, 75-66
Player to watch: Adrianna Wilson (5-8, Sr., G, 11.1 ppg)
Filar on the Bucs: “We really don’t know a lot about this team. They are supposed to have a good
transfer player, but they lost two key starters to graduation and they have been plagued by injuries, so we don’t
know who they will have in their lineup.”
Notes: Second-year guard Christina Ervin (10 ppg, 4.7 rpg) is out with a fractured toe and Rachel Glass (5-11, So.,
F, 14.4 ppg, 3.4 apg, 2.1 spg, 76.9 FT%) suffered a season-ending anterior cruciate ligament tear Jan. 11. Glass missed
much of last year with the same injury... ETSU returns just two starters from a disappointing 9-17 squad last season...
the Bucs stand second in the SC in field goal percentage at 42.5%, behind only Davidson (44.7%).

DC 4th.
DeSelm on the present state of his team: “Despite being tired and somewhat injured we still continue to do good
things in places. We just need the whole team to do it together at the same time every time we
get in the water.”

All but a couple hundred people missed one of the most fantastic finishes in Davidson sports history on Saturday night.
Tonight, see what you’ve been missing for way too long.

CK taking record by storm

Against App. St., senior forward Carolyn Kirsch sunk three free throws to become first on the career leaders list with
222. Kirsch is on track to break Davidson career records for points, field goals, and rebounds. Going into this...Past weekend’s
contest, junior center Jennie Vanlerberghe ranked 11th in the nation in field goal percentage, having made 56 of 89 shots
for a 62.9 percentage. Against UMBC on Thursday, Vanlerberghe made 3 of 4 shots and shot 50% in the win
over UT-Chattanooga on Saturday.

With its recent success, it is no surprise that Davidson is currently dominating many of the statistical categories in the
Southern Conference. Leading the league in field goal percentage, Kirsch is first in scoring with a 15.6 average while sophomore
guard Jamie Brown ranks as the leader in free throw percentage at an 86.2 clip. As a team, the Wildcats
lead the conference in six categories (scoring margin, FG percentage, FG percentage defense, blocked shots, steals, and rebound margin). The
only loss that Davidson has suffered in a month and a half was a 72-60 defeat to College of Charleston
on January 6th. The Wildcats should beware of the Cougars in the future, as they will join the Southern Conference
in 1997-98, becoming the ninth school in the league to field a women’s basketball program.

A personal note: Given the magnitude of the team’s recent success, it’s time that we put more fans in the
stands for the remaining games. You can always count on some community members and Third East, but otherwise, the attendance
is pretty poor. With their 11-3 and 3-0 start in conference play, the Wildcats have a great chance to earn
their first Southern Conference title and deserve more fan support. Mark the following dates on your calendar: Feb. 3, Feb.
8, Feb. 11, Feb. 22, Feb. 26.

The D.C. Lotto has returned this basketball season, with a Snowshoe skiing trip for four, including lift tickets, ski rentals,
and condo rental, as the grand prize. The contest will run through Feb. 10 and there are six more chances
to win, Feb. 1, 3, 6, 8 (2), 10. Lottery cards will be available at each game, and get your
card stamped because the more stamps you have the better your chances of winning. One stamp gets two tickets, two
stamps four tickets, three stamps eight tickets, and eight more tickets for each additional stamp. Other prizes, such as a
CD player and t-shirts, can be won.

Be a super happy cat fan
At the remaining basketball games, the four most outrageous fans will be chosen. The louder you cheer, the crazier you
dress, and the wilder your body paint, the more chance you have to win. The four superfans will receive prizes
at the last game of the year on February 22.

tions, for that is neither here nor there.) Bristow played only five minutes in the first frame due to foul
trouble, but his eight points helped give UTC a 37-29 intermission advantage. Again the Wildcats rallied in the second half.
An Ewodo layup from Landry Kosmalski gave Davidson a 57-54 lead with 9:07 to play. But the Mocs scored the
next eight points and did not look back. A game-ending 20-6 run secured the hard-fought win for the Mocs. Fatigue
undoubtedly hurt Davidson down the stretch. Davor Halbauer (knee) sat out the entire game and Marshall injured his left ankle
after only six minutes, leaving the Wildcats thin. “When you have to make shots down the stretch, you need energy,”
said McKillop. “Without Davor and Stephen, we lost some energy.” Davidson split two other conference games over break. On Jan.
8, the Wildcats lost their conference opener to Marshall, 85-81, despite a career-high 27 points from Mark Donnelly. The Wildcats
then topped Georgia Southern Jan. 11, 81-63.

Requisite suffering with the Hornets. With all due respect, no you haven’t. The Hornets became a franchise in 1988, seventy
years after the Boston Red Sox’ last World Series title. Chicago baseball fans have suffered even longer - the Cubs
last won it all in 1908, the White Sox in 1917. And the day the NFL’s Seahawks, Bucs, or Saints
win the Super Bowl will have been a long time coming for their championship-starved following. Recently, a certain lifelong Carolinian
countered my outlook, claiming this state has done its requisite suffering with the Hornets. With all due respect, no you
haven’t. The Hornets became a franchise in 1988, seventy years after the Boston Red Sox’ last World Series title. Chicago
baseball fans have suffered even longer - the Cubs last won it all in 1908, the White Sox in 1917.
And the day the NFL’s Seahawks, Bucs, or Saints win the Super Bowl will have been a long time coming
for their championship-starved following. So I’m not trying to blatantly burst your bubble of gridiron pride, although that’s essentially what
I’m doing. Seriously though, the Panthers deserve all the praise they’ve gotten. But my role here at Davidson is that
of the stereotypical Yankee pessimist, and therefore I must point out that this instant fairytale - and 13-win seasons -
will end at some point. For every 12-4, there is inevitably a 4-12 down the road. I don’t know when
that will happen. But when it does, then - and only then - will you become an honest-to-goodness fan.
