Add experience to your degree.

The world can be big and bad for some. For others, it looks much easier. Survival means different things to different people. Is it luck or preparation?

Preparation seems to be the key. Consider the leadership training and management skills you can develop in Army ROTC. The edge. That margin of difference that can put you ahead in the big, bad world of tough job competition.

You may be a sophomore. Or have just two years remaining in school. Itâ€™s not too late to add Army ROTC. And add experience to your degree. Contact:
