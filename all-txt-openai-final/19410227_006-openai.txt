Page Six — CORNER | Guest Columnist—Bob (By Jones) Johnston.

Colin has hit on the novel idea that a delegated responsibility serves two purposes most effectively. The first: It serves
to give men an opportunity to do “Y” work; the second, and this is the real reason, it gives him
a good excuse to “beat out,” or “dog” or whatever you call it where you come from.

Cabinet Meeting.

However, in this case it’s the reading public who will suffer. I'm going to run over briefly some of the
business taken up in the last Cabinet meeting since some of you may have wondered just what goes on in
such gatherings. To begin with, one of the more urgent matters is this thing of prayer groups. This is the
first year since Ben Hur put on long pants that the prayer groups have continued to meet even up to
the second semester. Let’s not grow lax on this post-exam calm as we are prone to do, in more ways
than one, and allow our prayer groups to peter out. If we are to continue as we should for the
remainder of the semester we must support our group leaders—reminding them if necessary. This thing is too important to let
slide.

Freshman Groups.

Another subject discussed was the possibility of having a “reconvening” of the freshman divisions. You of the class of '44
(Finley is looking over my shoulder, applauding vigorously) will remember that you were assigned a professor and a cabinet member
as a councilor during the Orientation Period. Although these groups have performed their fundamental job, we feel that it might
not be a bad idea if we could meet together again—the near future. Of course, many of these groups will
be rather “moth-eaten,” but that’s just another reason why we should meet again. There’s a hundred other things I'd like
to say, but I know Dale would be merciless with his shears.

Yours,
BOB JOHNSON.

AMONG THE GREEKS (Continued from Page Three)

Pledge Mac Bruce was reported deep in Marion (S. C.) Kappa Alpha. Nearly all of the brothers who went off
the campus at all this weekend went to the basketball game in Winston-Salem. Pledge Brother Belk was with the team,
and Brothers Washburn, T. Stimson, J. Stimson, Houston, Mason (plus a date), Watt, Lauck, Harris, Mitchell, and Sprunt as well
as Pledge Brother “Red” Burke were spectators. Some stayed for the dance, including Brother “The Reverend” Stimson. Brother Lowry, on
the trip of the week, went all the way home to Somerville, Tennessee, after taking in Winston-Salem. Also, Brother King
went to his home in Johnson City, Tennessee, spending part of the time in Bristol. Those who visited Charlotte were
Brothers Turnage and Flowers and Pledge Brother McWilliams. Sandifer also took an extended trip, going down to Spartanburg after taking
in Winston-Salem. Most of the brothers stayed on the campus this weekend, due to the big deal trip to Atlanta
which a majority of the brothers are planning to pull next week. However, as is usual, there were a number
of w. h. boys. Brothers Vereen and McLean went on the Virginia circuit, this deal covering the campuses of Hollins
and Sweet Briar. Brothers Chapman, Dale, and Hobbie, and Pledge Hayes followed the team up to Morristown while Brother Williams
went with the team. Brothers Booker and Westall spent an extended weekend in Lawsonville. A few brothers and pledges spent
a typical limber Saturday in Charlotte: the Broadway, Walgreen’s, and the early bus home. There was no feed at the
house Sunday night, and there were no guests over the weekend, but Brother Robinson asked us to say that he
stayed on the campus and studied, and he did.

Beta Theta Pi.

Wild hare upon wild hare was typical of this weekend. Brothers Balsley and McAfee chased up to Virginia to see
their Polly and Millie, respectively. Brother Church was off to Raleigh; Brother Thompson found his usual High Point girlfriend waiting
for him Saturday; Brother Barnwell kept his on-campus record clean by going to Greensboro to his Maggie. Can't tell where
Brothers Garrou and Rankin were but they were off; Brothers Rancey and Philips dated at Salem; Brother Bryant was between
Charlotte and Greensboro. The Charlotte troupe was made up of Brothers Efird, S. Mebane, Sumner, D. D. Phillips, Schmidt, Upchurch,
and Welch. Visitors at the house during the past week included Pledge Brother Rosborough’s family from Jacksonville, Fla.

Sigma Phi Epsilon.

This past weekend the brothers visited many places far and near. Brothers Kirkpatrick went home to Leaksville. Brothers H. Knox
and Edmondson visited Charlotte for reasons unknown. Brothers W. Knox and Billy Tarleton went down to Limestone and Spartanburg. Brother
Long Hollow went to Hickory, and Loy and Watson went to Berryhill. Brothers “Tag” Galbreath and Brown set out for
Raleigh, but only got as far as the edge of Burlington where they spent the weekend with Brother Bell, who
was very pleased and thrilled. Brother Bivins went to Elkin and Winston-Salem. Brother Dud spent the weekend in Charlotte. The
remainder of the brothers enjoyed the benefits of the campus. Brother Ed Hay also remained on the campus for some
reason.

which is firmly fixed in his mind. He believes, contrary to most opinions, that a bandleader can operate his own

Following editions have appeared since that time. The manual contains the names of all fraternities, social, honorary, and professional, their
date of founding, number of members, number of chapters, etc. Included under each fraternity is a brief history and a
detailed discussion of the fraternity. Also included in the book is a list of the Presidents of the United States,
the Vice-Presidents, and the members of the Cabinets who have been fraternity men. Important business men and authors are also
included in the listing. In connection with the fraternity manual, Prof. Davidson has announced that the Library is keeping on
file all copies of fraternal magazines and papers published. He stated that he would appreciate the fraternities contributing their local
fraternal publications.

To twelve months’ active duty either immediately upon graduation and acceptance of the Reserve Commission or within thirty to sixty
days thereafter in case such delay is requested. The Corps Area Commanders will report to the War Department at the
earliest practicable date the number of R. O. T. C. graduates by branch of service who will not be granted
deferment dates when it is anticipated that as Reserve Officers they may be ordered to one year of extended active
duty with the Regular Army.

1. Each assignment jurisdiction will prepare and maintain rosters for the purpose of establishing priority in which Reserve Officers, pertaining
to that assignment jurisdiction, will be ordered to extended active duty.
2. Officers will be arranged on the Roster in the order in which it is desired to call them to
active duty, considering factors in the following priority: (a) Exhibit of deferment proposed by the officer and the reasons therefor,
(b) Personal obligation to dependents, (c) Professional attainments and value to service; considering in this connection, age and physical aptitude,
(d) Need for individual services to the community in his civilian status.
3. Unless there are cogent reasons for contrary action, preference in fitting positions will be given to eligible Reserve Officers
who have QUALITY GROCERIES AT REASONABLE PRICES.

Students Hear Lecture On Wit and Humor In Literature.

Dr. Caleb Harding made a talk on “Aristophanic Wit and Humor in Present Day Literature” to the local chapter of
Eta Sigma Phi last Wednesday night, February 19, at the Y. M. C. A. reading room. After several business matters
were discussed, Dr. Harding gave his talk on the influence of Aristophanes in modern wit and humor. He gave several
puns and ditties as examples to illustrate his point. His examples proved to be very funny, yet they showed the
relation between present-day wit and humor and that of Aristophanes.

Professor Bailey and other members were present at the meeting, which ended about 9 o'clock.

Gordon Horton, and each year two pictures will be added. Although the success here has been excellent and partially unexpected,
Gordon Horton emphasized that the campaign is not over, and that the boxes will be left in convenient places with
the hope that even more will be contributed than has been heretofore.

### Schenck Makes Text Twenty-Third Psalm
PUBLIC DEMAND
(Continued from Page Five)

Tobaccos for Chesterfield, a process lasting from two to three years. Careful steps of planting, growing, harvesting, curing, aging, conditioning
for correct moisture content, and blending of the various domestic tobaccos with imported Turkish leaf are the groundwork. Then comes
modern fool-proof manufacture, making possible production of millions of packages of cigarettes per day. The Chesterfield factories at Durham, N.
C., portrayed in this book, alone cover one hundred and fifty acres. Every visitor to “Tobaccoland” finds a tour through
these factories an adventure in American manufacturing ingenuity, and he never forgets the bright golden color and rich fragrance of
the newly-opened hogshead of tobacco fresh from their long mellowing in storage.

“Tobaccoland, U. S. A.,” is also the story of a typical Southern tobacco-growing family, showing how the family’s life revolves
around the progress of the tobacco crop from season to season. The importance of the cities and universities of America’s
tobacco capital are shown in pictures and text. Many celebrities are again included in the new Chesterfield advertising campaign, scheduled
nationally in newspapers during February and March.

### Professor Finds Four Lessons In Old Familiar Passage. Praises Psalms.

Dr. Schenck started by saying that a man who introduces persons that become friends has done a great service to
the men. But a man who has introduced a book to a man and that book influences the life of
the man has done an even greater service. He went on to say that the Psalms have influenced the lives
of more men than any other book of the Bible.

### Four Lessons.

According to Dr. Schenck, four lessons can be gotten from the Twenty-third Psalm. A person who believes in God shall
have his needs cared for. Secondly, a person who believes in God shall be directed toward the ends which God
sets for us. Thirdly, a person who believes in God shall have more meaning to life than one who believes
not. Lastly, the person who believes in God shall be victorious against sin. These four points were discussed in some
detail after which Dr. Schenck closed the service with a word of prayer. The speaker for next Sunday will be
announced in chapel on Saturday.

It’s the smoker's cigarette
COOLER, MILDER, BETTER-TASTING

It’s called the SMOKER'S cigarette because Chesterfield is the one cigarette that gives you a COMPLETELY SATISFYING smoke. You try
a Chesterfield and find them COOL and PLEASANT. You light one after another and find they really TASTE BETTER. You
buy pack after pack and find that Chesterfields are MILDER. You can't buy a better cigarette.
