If you discovered you could change the past, would you?

Davidson theatre department’s latest production scheduled to be performed during Family Weekend, “Communicating Doors,” addresses that question with fast-paced wit and flair that leaves the audience with one unanimous answer: absolutely.

This wild British farce, written by Alan Ayckbourn, opens with a chatty dominatrix Poopay (Desi Domo ’09), a hard-faced businessman Julian Goodman (Ben Bashinski ’10), and his fatally ill business partner Reese Wells (Ian Bond ’10). Within the first twenty minutes of the play, Wells privately informs Poopay of his past embezzlement schemes and how his first two wives realized his greedy plots, resulting in their “accidental” deaths, carried out by Goodman.

When Goodman discovers what Poopay knows, the play quickly transforms into a life-and-death situation, literally. With a permeating sense of urgency, Poopay attempts to escape for her life, and accidentally discovers a hotel door that connects her with the past, thus arming her with enough information to stop the two murders from occurring in the future.

With the help of Reese’s second wife, an honest, upright woman named Ruella Wells (Kim Murphy ’09), Poopay must quickly race between the span of forty years through this “communicating” hotel door to prevent these murders, including Ruella’s own tragic fate.

Former Artistic Director of the Charlotte Repertory Theatre, Steve Umberger, directs this play for the second time with an all-star cast of Davidson junior and senior students.

“It’s been a lot of fun,” Mario Silva ’09, who plays the semi-clueless security detective at Wells’ hotel, said. “Probably the most fun I’ve ever had in a play. We’ve all known each other for three years; we’ve all done shows together. Everybody is so good. And Steve’s been great.”

Umberger himself is no stranger to Davidson. He has been directing performances on and off since...

### Wireless network expands coverage

In the last 14 months, Davidson College’s Information Technology Services (ITS) has implemented several improvements to make wireless internet access more widespread and user-friendly.

These changes included an upgrade in the bandwidth, the deployment of new wireless access points, and the expansion of wireless access across campus, including the student lounge in Davidson College Presbyterian Church.

According to Mur Muchane, Executive Director of Information Technology Services, over the summer ITS split the wireless network into separate networks — WildcatNet for student-owned computers and DavidsonSecure for College-owned computers.

According to Muchane, the goal of this change was to increase security to protect those who use the network to conduct sensitive transactions, such as online banking. However, some students who came back to campus early in August noted that the new network, WildcatNet, was a bit cumbersome to join.

For this reason, ITS has decided to do away with WildcatNet by October 27 and replace it with DavidsonSecure, a new network that Muchane describes as “easier to use because it allows all computers...

### Town planners seek input

The Town of Davidson is moving forward with the creation of its Comprehensive Plan, according to town communications director Sara-Lynne Levine, and the next step for the town is getting people on board for study groups.

A “study group” is a group of about ten town citizens—citizenship is the only prerequisite for membership—who will spend the next 18-24 months discussing and holding public town meetings about a certain subject “umbrella,” Levine said.

These subject umbrellas are, according to the Town of Davidson’s website: environmental sustainability, mobility, economic development, growth management, local governance, community character, and community development.

“These study groups are the backbone of public input for the Comprehensive Plan,” Lauren Blackburn, a town planner, said.

Public input is nothing new to the town, indicated Connie Wessner, a member of the town’s Planning Board. The Planning Board itself provides for citizen input in new town development by representing a cross-section of town residents from a wide range of neighborhoods and backgrounds. Wessner said that there is a constructive relationship between elected officials, town staff, and citizens, and Davidson is “unusual in its ability to foster those ties.”

Davidson has a diverse citizen makeup, and citizens bring these differences to town discussions. Wessner said that no one group of citizens takes the lead in town-wide initiatives, but instead, the town likes to foster an in-depth dialogue.

This is “the way Davidson tends to do business,” Wessner said. “[The] Comprehensive Plan is a good reflection of that.”

The purpose of the Plan is to “develop and document consensus on the values that should guide growth,” Wessner said. And this plan will not work unless there is a strong general consensus about what these values are.

This is where the study groups become involved. The study groups will determine citizen values and attitudes toward the aforementioned...
