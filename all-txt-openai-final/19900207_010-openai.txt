**Movie review: Cruise shines in Born on the Fourth of July**

By MATT GOAD

Born on the Fourth of July is a movie about the Vietnam war, but only a relatively small part of
the movie takes place in Vietnam. Unlike Vietnam movies such as Platoon or Full Metal Jacket, it concentrates on what
happens to a Vietnam vet after his participation in the war.

Tom Cruise plays Ron Kovic, whose real-life story provides the basis of the movie. Ron is convinced that the communists
are everywhere and that soon they will take over the United States. Thus, he joins the Marines right out of
high school, during the first stages of the Vietnam war. He wants to get in on the action before the
war is over.

A bullet wound that leaves him paralyzed from the mid-chest down sends him home, but not before he has some
experiences that will haunt him through the rest of the film. When Ron first gets home, he is appalled to
find that many Americans violently oppose the war he has sacrificed his body for. He tells people not to pity
him for his injury, and in most cases, they don’t. Instead, he must face people’s fear of and aversion to
his physical disability.

He begins to pity himself, and his attitude towards the war changes. He feels that the government has lied to
him to compel him to fight in an unpopular war, and he objects to any further loss of American lives
in Vietnam. To deal with his problems, Ron stays drunk most of the time. This gives rise to conflicts with
his parents that lead him to leave home. He goes to Mexico where a community dominated by injured Vietnam vets
has developed.

Ron quickly adapts to the lifestyle of the veterans he finds in Mexico. These vets live in an alcoholic stupor
varied only by the visits of prostitutes and frequent gambling. Ron manages to eventually escape from this trap. He returns
to the U.S., where he finds a purpose for his life despite his confinement to a wheelchair. He becomes a
leader in an organization of Vietnam vets against the war.

Cruise gives an enthralling portrayal of a boy becoming an embittered man injured in body and spirit, who comes to
grips with the tragedy of his life and rises above it. While the other characters float in and out of
the story, Cruise appears in every scene, and his presence acts as a cohesive force for the film. Born on
the Fourth of July is a long movie, close to two and a half hours long, but Cruise’s performance kept
my attention the whole time, and I wouldn’t have minded if it was even longer.

**German bier: Children of the malt part IV**

By JOHN HUTCHINSON

This week’s guest drinkers were Mark McCulloh, Associate Professor of German, his wife Audrey McCulloh, Visiting Lecturer in German, and
Thomas Fischer, exchange student from Germany’s Bavaria. We met at the McCulloh’s home just outside of Mooresville. The move apparently
fooled Charles Houck and Tom Moore, the Domino’s pizza guys, as neither one showed up for the tasting session.

The session saw the introduction of Anheuser Busch’s Budweiser. Intended as a sort of yardstick to gauge the other beers
against, it instead became the butt of insults as the evening wore on. Thomas Fischer called for a “Bud Bowl
III,” with any German beer as the rival of Budweiser. The moral is: if you want to drink Budweiser and
enjoy the taste, never preface it with a German import.

Spaten (Munich): Brewed since 1397. Strong, pleasant beer smell. Bitter. “Nice cereal taste” —M. McCulloh. “Pretty Yummy” —A.McCulloh: “It might
be a bit too bitter for Germans” — Fischer.

Krombacher Pils (Krombach): Sweet beer, vaguely Canadian taste. The taste fails to distinguish itself. “More yeast than hops” — M.
McCulloh. “Not the typical taste of German beer” — Fischer.

St. Pauli Girl (Bremen): Initially bland, but it gets somewhat better. Smooth with a bite. “Good for watching football games”
— Fischer. “I think it is a good beer, a little on the sweet side” — McCulloh.

Beck’s (Bremen): Smoother, fuller taste, grows on you better than (St. Pauli Girl). “Comfortable to drink with food or if
you want to drink a lot” — Fischer. “The aftertaste doesn’t bite, but the carbonation bothers me” — M. McCulloh.
“Vegetable taste” — A. McCulloh.

Maisel’s Weizen kristall-klar (Bayreuth): Bright, light, cloudy, sweet. “Tastes like a lollipop” — A. McCulloh. “Great summertime beer” — M.
McCulloh. “This is what we in Bavaria like most. It is a good drinking beer” — Fischer. “Really good if
you don’t mind the sweetness” — M. McCulloh. Upon being told it was Maisel’s Weizen: “Shows you how American beer
has ruined my taste: in Germany this is considered a poor weizen beer” — Fischer.

Maisel’s Weisse Hefe (Bayreuth): Nice golden color, a bit cloudy. Good body, distinctive character. “Real cereal taste in it” —
M. McCulloh. “Tastes like a cross between beer and cider” — A. McCulloh.

Hofbrau (Bavaria): Smooth, very good. Bite gives it character, less bite than Spaten. “Good taste” — Fischer.

Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock (Aying): Very dark color, nice smell. Very rich and smooth. “I couldn’t have very much of this”
— McCulloh. “It would be wonderful with venison. It wouldn’t be good with a hamburger or cheeseburger or something from
Cornelius” — Fischer.

Best Beer: Spaten, Hofbrau, Maisel
Worst Beer: Krombacher, St. Pauli Girl, Beck’s

Germans take their beer very seriously, and there is a rich tradition of brewing in the country. For instance, Klumbacher
Monkshof has been brewed since 1349, while Spaten was first produced in 1397. In 1516, the Reinheitsgebot, or purity law,
set standards for brewing that are still followed by countries the world over. According to the Reinheitsgebot, beer can be
produced with nothing more than pure water, barley, hops, and yeast. Until recently, the Germans imported only McEwan’s (Scottish), Tuborg
(Danish), Guinness (Irish), and Budweiser (Czechoslovakian) — beers brewed in compliance with the standards set by the purity law.

Beer in Germany is consumed in many forms. Children are given kinderbier, a non-alcoholic beer with a yeast and barley
malt taste. A Russisch, or Russian, is a popular mixture of weizen beer (wheat beer) and coke. More popular during
the summer months is the radler, a refreshing blend of lemonade and coke. The time of day is not important
either, as Germans are known to consume hefe weisse bier for breakfast or for zweites frühstück (second breakfast) at about
10 o'clock. Because the drinking age is 16 and beer is so much a part of the culture, overconsumption is
not a problem in Germany — with the exception of Oktoberfest and other popular celebrations. There are delivery services that
take beer (as well as mineral water and juice) by the case door to door every week. A case, consisting
of 20 half-liter bottles, costs about $6, while a case of very good beer runs about $9. Even coke is
more expensive.
