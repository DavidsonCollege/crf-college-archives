Obituary Number 3: DYING DEMAGOGUE WILSON STARR...
By DICK MOREHEAD

“Hippodrome of hypocrisy, hippodrome of hypocrisy, that’s what it is,” said he with a twitch, a twinkle, and a bang on the table that almost turned over the glasses. As we moved closer, we saw that this red-faced man was surrounded by evident devotees, Y scouts, and the oddly curious. Puzzled and perplexed, my buddy turned to me and said, “What is this madness?" Whereupon, I took him aside and related some of the fascinating facts and figures on Wilson C. Starr, 180 pounds of diabolical intellect, vivid imagination, amazing experience, and terrestrial tastes.

Mr. Starr, better known as “Brother Beelzebub” among those who know him best, is a senior according to the latest report from official sources. In private, he admits that his home is somewhere in “the Switzerland of America,” West Virginia. A pre-med by choice, he is preparing for Duke graduate school with hopes set on becoming an all-around, financially secure M.D.

If you wonder who pilots that “big black thing” up, down, and around U.S. 21, ponder no more. Mr. Starr conveys his person (and numerous others) around in this elongated hearse, affectionately called “Grace.” By definition, Grace is a sleek, black, eight-passenger, custom-built Packard weighing some 5,500 pounds with roll-up windows between front and back lounge chairs that make it a joy for double dating. Its owner claims that she formerly belonged to Mrs. Henry L. Daugherty, chief stockholder in Cities Service, although rumor has it that Al Capone ditched it on a dry run through W. Va.

Grace leads a very active life. During vacation sprees, she can be found freighting a load of mountaineers to “the hills of home;” over blast weekends, she conveys couples from Davidson to extremities; and when not on special “mission” duty, she ferries the boys—from New York to Natchez, from Craigy House to Cornelius. When asked what would happen to Grace when her owner passed on to greener pastures, he dramatically replied, “I couldn’t bear to have her in hands that did not appreciate her. There is only one thing to do—take her to Catawba and dynamite her.”

Mr. Starr is a man of distinction known for his distinguishing tastes. His sophisticated search for fine foods takes him all over the eastern U.S. Annually, he goes on a cultural pilgrimage to Washington for champagne “served in a continental setting, as it should be served;” to the Pheasant Farm for exquisite bird; to New England for lobster; to the beach for shrimp; and to Hatties for the stimulating atmosphere. This past summer, he conducted a well-attended “Starr Course” on “How to drink socially,” but was forced to retire due to a lingering occupational disease.

A prominent socialite, he weaves in and out of Huntington society, where they serve “Ohio beer—only the rabble drink that W. Va water.” A lover of fine animals, Mr. Starr has surrounded himself with the best pet birds and fish available. He is still in mourning for his Siamese Fighting Fish who passed away recently because of the extreme cold and inconsistent diet of Frozen Daphne and tropical fish food. It is now somewhere in the Catawba.

Now Cornelius is where the Starr manse is located. It is a small but quite adequate five-room house encompassed on the sides by the Satterfields and a truck driver, in back by rising foothills, and in front by a placid lake which often serves as experimental ground for nightly nauticals. This manse is further inhabited by epicureans Cannon, Hall, and Ponder, who with our young Socrates of society make this a center of political, cultural, social and when unavoidable, intellectual pursuits.

Among other refined abilities, Mr. Starr is a virtuoso of some one note. In his greener years, he battled courageously with Bach, Brahms, Beethoven, and Brubeck. Not content with individual achievement, he also pursued two piano composers until forced to relinquish the keyboard when the instructor became ill. His distinctive interests in music are mostly responsible for a tremendous collection of records and some 200 odd piano rolls. These records were formerly played with penetrating volume by a revised Capehart model changer, capable of spinning fifty disks, front and back without repeating, stopping, or touch of human hand. That makes two solid days of music. He confesses that many a lost weekend was thus spent soaking up the finer things of life. This player was also the nemesis of Georgia dorm, which rocked in the AM to the Grand Canyon Suite and tumbled quietly with uncensored releases in the P.M.

Our subject also dabbled in interior decorating. In fact, he is chairman of that famed designing and decorating committee of the Kappa Alpha lodge, where those “telltale tastes” are in striking evidence. This work of artistic allusion has aroused much comment, ranging from “that Parisian poolroom” to the “oriental apartment” by more conservative critics.

Always an admirer of J. P. Morgan, Mr. Starr traverses financial circles with fanatic freedom. As treasurer of his social fraternity, he establishes assessments, sells raffle tickets on old furniture, frequents wholesale houses, and generally bankrupts brothers. As director of disbursements (self-appointed), he purchases religious records (“Shake-a-hand”), TV aerials, Confederate collections, “The Best of Playboy,” and such items as one gross of monogrammed ping pong balls. His treatment of the books has often been compared to his equally acute manipulation of physics solutions.

A man of critical taste in the realm of belles lettres, he has also contributed to the arts a little bit of his creative ability and aristocratic analyses. He has also presented many immortal luncheon lectures, called the “How Series,” and featuring such subjects as “The social benefits of million-dollar churches,” and “How to get ahead in a behind world.”

One of Mr. Starr’s more hidden talents is his lyric ability. His latest creation is entitled “My Alma Mater” and reads:
“Oh, give me a home
Where the middle class roam,
And the YMCA boys play.
Where seldom is heard
An intelligent word,
And we think about sin once a day.”

Although most of his work is now written, he has aspirations of attaining a place on the shelves of the Davidsonian Room in later years.

GRADUATE FELLOWSHIP HINTS:
Starr Scholarship Committee [Essay Contest Open |At Davidson Soon Gives Advice On Grants
By TOM MORGAN

In the past few months, there have been long lists of graduate scholarship announcements published in the Davidsonian. The fact that most students fail to realize is that these scholarships could be won by Davidson students. According to the Graduate Scholarship Committee, the key to winning such scholarships is to begin preparation early, preferably no later than the sophomore year. The committee, composed of Professors Cumming, Gallent, Labban, Penk, and Watts, with Prof. Abernethy as chairman, would urge the student to begin by writing for a catalog from several graduate schools in which he might be interested. Also, one might plan a short trip to the campus of a school he is considering.

Of primary importance is to take the courses which are required for admission by the school. For instance, Latin, calculus, and statistics are necessary in some far-removed fields of study. This advice cannot be overstressed. Next, you should talk with the faculty member in your major department and with some member of the Graduate Scholarship Committee. If you are interested in particular scholarships such as Rhodes Scholarships, see Prof. Cumming, or Fulbright scholarships, Prof. Watts. For scholarships in science, see Prof. Gallent.

Finally, when you do start filling out the application and getting recommendations, be sure to remember the helps given by Prof. McCutchan in an article in the Davidsonian earlier in the year: notify the professor well in advance that you would like his recommendation, provide him with all the data on your college activities, and get the forms to him as early as possible.

The gratifying record of students in the past who followed the above plan lends support to its validity. Last year, for instance, about 20 awards ranging in stipend from $900 to $2500 for the first year of graduate study were won by Davidson men. In addition, there have been three Rhodes scholarships, three Danforth scholarships, and six Morehead scholarships awarded to Davidson students in the last few years. The prospects for receiving a scholarship are brighter today than ever before. First, because there are more scholarships offered and also because many students go from college directly into the Army.

Also, there is an interesting new feature in the way of graduate scholarships. This is the offering of interdisciplinary studies, which consists of studying several fields related to your major rather than specializing in one field. For instance, taking work in the social sciences and humanities as a whole rather than just history or sociology alone. Pomona and Stanford offer this type of program. Northwestern, Columbia, and Pennsylvania have introduced area studies. Here history, political science, economics, and related fields are combined to help in the understanding of whole areas like Southeastern Asia, Africa, Japan, Eastern Europe, or the Middle East.

In addition to the usual fields, the committee is interested in seeing students apply for scholarships in less crowded fields such as political science, public administration, social work, group work, and high school teaching. They feel that if Davidson, as the leading men’s college in the South, is to fulfill its obligation to supply the South with well-qualified men in all areas of experience and development that it must also begin to produce men to serve in these areas.

If you are interested in graduate work, there are many possibilities open for scholarships. The important thing is to begin preparing for these very early in your college career.

JERRY SPEAKS:
Last week I was fortunate enough to travel with the indoor track team to Lexington, Va., for the Southern Conference Indoor Track Meet. The outcome of the meet was probably what everyone expected. However, things went well for Davidson. With a team of only seven men—Gramley, Ashcraft, Huffaker, Koonce, Diuguid, Mitchner, and “Mr. 440” (Roswell Mallory), the team did outstanding work, bringing back ten beautiful medals. Two of these were won by Pete Ashcraft in the one mile and two mile runs. The remarkable thing here is that Ashcraft has not run this distance in consecutive laps since cross-country season. With a third place under their belts, the boys were satisfied and looking forward to another outdoor season.

As I have said before, it seems that the Kappa Sigs are the team to beat in the fraternity basketball tourney. They overpowered the Sigma Chis handily last Tuesday night to gain undisputed possession of first place. However, the Pi Kapps almost upset the apple cart Wednesday night with the Kappa Sigs winning by a two-point margin.

Masquers Practice For Next Production
The Red and Black Masquers have begun rehearsals on “Journey's End,” a British play by Robert Sheriff, which will be taken on tour to surrounding colleges the latter part of the spring holidays. After the conclusion of the tour, the Masquers hope to present the play here on the campus. Fred Summers, president of the Red and Black Masquers, says that although the tour schedule is still indefinite, North Carolina State, Queens, Sullins, Converse, and Salem are probable stops.

“Journey’s End” takes place in a British dug-out before an impending battle in World War I. Dunbar Ogden plays the leading character, Captain Stanhope, and Associate Professor R. W. Tyson is the director. Rehearsals were started on February 21 and the first performance should be around March 20.

Your Classification
(ACP) — A letter-to-the-editor writer in a Western University weekly classified college students into five categories: “The proletariat radicals, who would be more at home in a linseed oil factory than in a classroom; (2) the bourgeois socialists; (3) the nouveau riche pseudo-intellectuals; (4) the lip-curling aristocrats; and (5) the esoterics, listening to the depraved mouthings of others in detached silence.”

Babbling
I could tell by the loud silence that our subject had ended his oration on hypocrisy, so I quickly took my friend over for a formal introduction to Wilson C. Starr, man of distinction.

Starr, man of distinction.“Club Cabaret™ informal dance will be presented for the enjoyment and entertainment of the student body. The theme prevailing throughout the dance will be that of a French cabaret complete with checkerboard cloths and candle centerpieces. Jesse Morrow's popular Negro combo from Charlotte has been booked for the evening of Saturday, March 5, and all indications point to a night packed with the spice and flavor of gay Paree. Refreshments will be served by dinner-jacketed waiters and a risqué interlude of Broadway song and dance numbers will be presented in an effort to provide the couples with an evening which is both diversified and unique. The dance will be held in the Union ballroom from 8:30-12:00. Admission will be only $1.00 per couple. The number of reservations will be limited to twenty-five couples in order to keep the atmosphere as close and authentic as possible. Reservations may be obtained from either Mrs. Sellars Drinking Problem {Cecil The Magician (Rotary Wheel Spins Fortune for Fenton The Intercollegiate Association for Study of the Alcohol Problem invited Davidson students this week to enter its nationwide editorial writing contest on the subject “Is There a College Drinking Problem?” Twenty-four hundred dollars will be awarded to students participating, individually and to class groups, including first prize of $250 and group participation prizes of $25 each. The prizes are given out of a trust fund set up by Logan Hall Roberts and his son. Through this fund, the Intercollegiate Association brings to students in North American colleges each year an opportunity to participate in a series of editorial writing awards on a subject that is often closely related to their class work. Rules of the contest are: The contest is open to any full-time undergraduate student registered in a college, university, or junior college in the United States or Canada for any term of the school year 1954-55. No student who has written professionally is eligible. The general theme of the contest is “Drinking in College.” Editorials may deal with any phase of the theme and each writer shall select his own title. The maximum length of each editorial is 800 words and the minimum length is 500 words. Manuscripts must be typewritten (double spaced) or written in ink. The author’s name must not appear on the manuscript. An entry blank must accompany each entry. The deadline is May 1, 1955. To be considered, an editorial must not be postmarked later than this date. Judging will be based on soundness and originality of thought, quality of research, clarity of expression, and accuracy of basic facts. For further information and contest entry blanks, students may contact YMCA Secretary Sam McGill. Library Adds Latest Popular Best Sellers The Davidson College Library has recently acquired five new books, including the top three fiction books in the country according to the New York Herald Tribune of January 30. The other two additions are Good Morning, Miss Dove, rated sixth by the Tribune, and a non-fiction book, The Saturday Evening Post Treasury. View from Pompey’s Head Hamilton Basso’s View from Pompey’s Head, rated first in the fiction books of the nation, is the story of a New York lawyer who returns to his birthplace in the South, Pompey’s Head, for the purpose of investigating a literary claim. The book compares the social distinctions of the small Southern town with the questions of reputation and standing in New York literary circles. Love Is Eternal Rated second is Irving Stone's Love Is Eternal, a warm and stirring novel which deals with Mary Todd and Abraham Lincoln up to the time of Lincoln's assassination. The author takes certain liberties with history in trying to persuade the reader to accept Mary Todd as the one who lifted Lincoln to success. No Time for Sergeants Mac Hyman’s No Time for Sergeants is rated third. It is a light and humorous story of Will Stockdale, who is inducted into the army and tries to help everybody—even the sergeants. But his methods only get him into trouble. Vick Chemical Co. To Interview Juniors The Vicks Chemical Company will have a representative in the College Union on March 7. Excellent positions are available for juniors interested in going into business upon graduation. The program, in the form of a Summer Testing Period, begins in June and continues throughout the entire summer; traveling expenses and a bonus at the end of the season in addition to the regular salary are paid by the company. Interested students should contact the Student Activities Office of the College Union immediately. in the Union office, or by contacting Cam Cridlebaugh or John Fite. It is urged that students act early so as not to be disappointed by being unable to get reservations. Wins Fellowship to Marburg University The Central Mississippi District of Rotary International has designated John Fenton as recipient of the Rotary International Foundation Fellowship for Advanced Study. This fellowship is to be used for one year of graduate work at Phillips University in Marburg, Germany. Fenton, a senior from Rolling Fork, Mississippi, is a member of Kappa Sigma social fraternity, Eumenean Literary Society, and the Male Chorus. He has earned his major in philosophy and plans to extend his study into theology during the 1955-56 term at Marburg, then to return to this country for further study leading to his doctorate. Whose head shall roll? Your roommate's, your professor’s, or maybe your own? This is the question posed by the Special Features Committee as it reveals the forthcoming appearance of one of the country’s most versatile magicians, Coke Cecil, who will publicly decapitate some unoffending Davidsonian. Tickets for Mr. Cecil's performance, to be presented March 4 in the College Union Ballroom, are available in advance for a quarter in Mr. Smith's office. Cecil, who has recently returned from a professional tour of the Near East, appears regularly on college campuses, at conventions, and before executive clubs and business associations. He is a past president of the Southeastern Magicians’ Association and has performed in each state of the nation during his 25 years of experience. Accompanying Mr. Cecil will be one of America’s most complete and costly collections of equipment, including accouterments for such specialty acts as the Ethereal Bird, the epochal Floating Lady, and the appalling Chinese Guillotine. Besides his feats of magic, Cecil is proficient as a ventriloquist and hypnotist.

(I.P.)—A study of the factors which are associated with persistence in college is being conducted here for each of the more than 1,350 freshmen enrolled at the University of Kansas. The new students have been asked to complete a questionnaire: travel throughout Europe. Rotary International annually awards more than 150 similar fellowships to graduate students for a year’s study abroad with the belief that the student will gain a better understanding of social and economic life in the country to which the scholarship applies. of writings, interviews, speeches presented by the candidates. While at Marburg Fenton will undertake a regular curriculum and engage in restricted travel. Following the close of the term will be a summer of extensive travel within a 300-mile radius of the campus at Marburg. Varsity Outlook... (Continued from Page Five) Harry Peterson is the only tackle lost by graduation. Such stalwarts as Harold Davis, also a guard, Tom Lee, Adsir Hatcher, Ken Lawing, and Dick Jones are returning. JV players who should step up next season are Brown Hamer and Little Howard. The guard position will suffer greatly, with the loss by graduation of first-stringers Dickie Davis and Jim Fasul meaning a lot. (Fasul doesn’t graduate, but he has used up all his eligibility.) However, the places they have vacated are being ably filled by Lyle Llewellyn, Dave McLain, Bob Stansill, Tom Owen, Bob Talbert, and Dale Gramley. The center position does not lose a man by graduation, so returning will be “Bo” Abernathy, Bill Price, Tal Broughton, Gene Reid, and Don Moore. These five men give the Cats perhaps the best crew of centers in the conference, so the middle of the line won't be lacking in depth or experience. Though this is, at best, only a brief run-down from next year's prospects, it does give the average fan an idea of what to expect from the Cats when the season rolls around. Considering the quality and quantity of boys returning, the Cats should at least maintain last season’s record, this time against a tougher schedule. With a good crop of freshmen to supplement the squad we now have, these boys could make next season the one folks will remember when discussing football at Davidson. For a first-hand view of what the Wildcats will look like next season, drop down to the Alumni-Varsity game next Saturday. You won't be disappointed. Drink ‘M O O R’ Mooresville Creamery, Inc.
