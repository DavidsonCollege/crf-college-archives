Computer Center: stop software piracy
By Jenny Schroeter

The Computer Services Center (CSC) sponsored a Software Honesty Awareness Day in Chambers Lobby on Wednesday, February 9 to educate
both Davidson students and faculty members about the legal use of computer software.

The illegal copying of computer software was the main focus of the event. The CSC showed individuals how to distinguish
between the three types of software. The staff also recommended keeping items that could prove ownership of software in case
an accusation of illegally copying software was brought up.

One-on-one discussions were held on the importance of reading the Software License Agreement that accompanies each computer program that is
purchased. Individuals learned that most commercial programs allow the purchaser to load software onto one machine and to make one
copy for backup purposes. In most cases, anything beyond these two steps is illegal and punishable with fines up to
$100,000 per infraction.

As a college with public computer labs, Davidson takes on a tremendous risk. If an individual is caught illegally copying
a computer program (known as software piracy), both the individual and the school are liable. The University of Oregon is
all too aware of this liability after paying $120,000 in fines for software piracy. By sponsoring the Software Honesty Awareness
Day, the CSC is attempting to safeguard Davidson College in case a software crime occurs. Lydia Lorenzin, the Coordinator of
Academic Facilities and Services, said, “We want to take the initiative before the problem occurs. Many people illegally copy software
out of ignorance.” The CSC hopes to stop this ignorance and make people aware.

With many software companies losing money because of illegal copying, local software companies strongly supported Davidson’s efforts in educating the
campus. Students who attended the event were able to enter a drawing to be eligible to win one of 35
software programs donated by local companies to show their support for the program. Students were also able to pick up
a copy of SP Audit for Apple and IBM computer systems. This program creates an inventory of the commercial software
programs installed on the computer. Most of those who attended the event agreed that they were able to learn more
about the legalities behind copying software. For those who were not able to attend and are interested in learning more
about software piracy, information is available at the CSC.

College Republicans await rivals
By Mary Laura Moretz

The SGA approved the charter for the College Republicans two weeks ago, but the Republicans have no official party rivals
on campus. The College Democrats have not sought a charter or shown signs of electing officers.

At their last meeting, the College Republicans elected Bill Gullan and Chad Lloyd co-chairs. The club’s constitution states their purpose
as “to develop political skills and leadership abilities among Republican students as preparation for future service by them to the
party and the community.” They plan for some members to attend the state Republican convention later this month. Currently, they
are working

students being exposed to STDs through unprotected sex may also be being exposed to AIDS. The staff wants to decrease
that risk as much as possible by having condoms available. Because cabinets are stocked irregularly, some students hoard condoms and
leave the cabinet empty for the next person. Ringle says that the cabinet supplies are intended for emergency situations only
and hopes that the decreased number of packets being prepared is a sign that students are buying their own condoms.
Terry insists that the memo was “trying to get RAs to stock the cabinets, not trying to imply that there
is anything more scary than usual out there.”On scheduling some speakers as well, Gullan says they will also “help out
in local elections in the fall.” Among their goals, Gullan adds, is “to debate the Young Democrats if they are
ever formed.” The Democrats, however, have not elected officers since last year. Dan Nechemias, the last active president of the
College Democrats, says students have shown low interest in meetings over the past year. As for debates: “I don’t know
if we will or not.” They have not seen a pressing need for a charter, although Nechemias surmises “we may
get one next year.” Last year the Democrats received a significant amount of money from the Democratic National Committee. Most
likely, Nechemias says, the group will become more active during the Congressional races later this year.
