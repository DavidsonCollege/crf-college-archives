### African National Congress members show the truth behind a myth

By JEFF DEMPSEY ’83

Apartheid. Does this word mean anything to you? Last Thursday, five members of the African National Congress, all exiles living in the U.S., came to Davidson to talk about what apartheid means to South African blacks. Throughout the day, the group spoke with students in various meetings about the issues of the situation in South Africa and then presented in the 900 Room a play entitled “For Better Not For Worse,” written by one of the actors.

Founded in 1912, the African National Congress (A.N.C.) is the only South African liberation organization that accepts members of all races. Banned inside South Africa, the A.N.C. has offices and representatives in 28 countries worldwide as well as observer status in the United Nations and recognition from the Organization of African Unity.

Tandi Gcabashe headed the group on campus last week. Aside from coordinating the ANC in the southern U.S., she organizes Southern African Programs for the American Friends Service Committee, a Quaker organization, in Atlanta where junior Debby Williams met her this summer. Tandi’s father, Albert John Luthuli, won the 1961 Nobel Peace Prize for his leadership of non-violent protests against the South African government in the late '50s and early ’60s.

The group’s other members included: a professor in psychology at State University, Stony Brook, N.Y.; Themba Ntinga, a member of the ANC Observer Mission to the U.N. and a student of journalism; and Selaelo Maredi and Seth Sibanda who have toured all over the U.S. and Canada presenting plays which Selaelo, a prize-winning playwright, has written.

In South Africa, 72 percent of the population is black Africans, 16 percent whites, 9 percent coloureds, and 3 percent Indians. Under the Land Acts of 1912 and 1936, 87 percent of the country’s land has been reserved for whites, 13 percent for the blacks (the Bantustan). Africans may not own land in white areas nor remain in white areas without a permit. Indians and Coloureds must live in segregated areas in the territory reserved for whites. The Bantustan offers little possibility for employment, so the vast majority of black men must leave their families to go to white South Africa to find work.

While white living standards are among the world’s highest, blacks live a difficult existence. Black labor is forbidden to have labor unions; the average white worker makes 10 to 18 times more than the average black worker performing the same job; no black worker by law can hold a position higher than any white worker in a company. By way of example, Tandi cited the gold miners' strike in Johannesburg this past year in which some gold miners refused to return to the mines in a non-violent strike. The government reacted by sending police who forced the miners back to work at gunpoint, with 13 people being killed and 200 injured in the struggle. This action, however, led to a widening of the strike at which the company then fired all the strikers, being able to do so because of the availability of surplus labor among blacks. Having lost their work permits, the strikers could only return to the Bantustan without much hope for employment there.

This incident illustrates all too well the efficiency of the South African government. Since blacks must have a passbook even to enter white South Africa, the security police are able to keep a close watch on any black who might try to become an organizer of resistance. A particularly effective method against the outspoken, moreover, has been banning orders, an order by which a person becomes confined to his residence during certain periods of the day, cannot speak with more than one other person at a time, and lives under general surveillance for 5 years. Such a banning order was imposed on Tandi’s father at one time.

The educational system of South Africa reflects the situation as...a whole in the country. If one is black, secondary education is optional and the student bears the expense, while for whites secondary education is compulsory and free. In addition, the government allots on the order of $12 for every white student to $1 for every black student in education. Indeed, one of the primary objectives of the current speaking/drama tour by these members of the ANC is to raise money for a school in Tanzania where Bantu children have been brought since 1977 to be educated. Thus, the fee put up by the coalition of campus groups — the Black Student Coalition, the Speakers Committee, and the Chapel Committee — to bring these people to campus went directly to the fund for the Solomon Mahlangu College in Tanzania. A major sponsor was Amnesty International which brought the ANC to campus as part of their program to educate the student body and community about human rights violations.

In the face of such obvious oppression, one must ask, why does the United States support the South African regime? South Africa is tremendously important economically and strategically, controlling an immense amount of mineral reserves as well as the sea lanes around the tip of Africa. A government of leftist leanings has always been the fear of the U.S., and most officials would consider that situation simply unacceptable. The U.S. also has invested heavily in South Africa with more than 300 U.S. companies having operations there. Thus, the policy of administrations has consistently been an emphasis on maintaining the status quo.

Acknowledging the importance of South Africa to the West, the question becomes what to do about the presence of U.S. corporations there: whether to work through them for internal reforms or to pressure them through boycotts to pull out of South Africa. The ANC supports the latter technique, which is called divestment because internal reforms by American corporations are severely limited by the apartheid legal system. Through the American Friends Service Committee, Tandi is currently working on divestment campaigns directed toward getting institutions, local governments, and even state governments in the U.S. to boycott corporations that do business in South Africa. Frustrated with attempts to work through corporations, Tandi feels that people should be made aware that they are indeed supporting injustice in South Africa through these businesses. She points out that many companies go to South Africa because the oppressive system means cheap labor and thus bigger profits.

Within South Africa, the ANC carries on underground operations, including the practice of sabotage bombings. Violence has been a part of their philosophy since the early 1960s, though when Tandi’s father won the Peace Prize, the Nobel Committee praised him specifically for his strict adherence to non-violent protest. The words of Dr. Dube reflect an attitude that leaves many people feeling uneasy, but an attitude that is nonetheless reality: “We always wish to use non-violent measures, and we always do use non-violent measures first. But, in a violent situation, non-violent measures are sometimes not enough.”

Apartheid finally exists not as a system but as an attitude. The division between black and white in South Africa is taken to extremes well beyond the level necessary for purely economic manipulation. When a black American visits South Africa, he must be declared an Honorary White to move freely in the country. A black man can be imprisoned for eating with a white at the white man’s house. It is as if there must be no chinks in the facade for fear that whites might discover the truth behind the myth of racial superiority. Perhaps Selaelo’s story about his own experiences in theatre illustrates the thinking behind apartheid. He led experimental theatre groups that became increasingly political until he had to leave the country. The reason, he said, that the government allowed the theatre to be uncensored for so long is that they felt blacks were incapable of using drama for anything more than entertainment.
