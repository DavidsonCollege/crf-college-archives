Bookstore work-study students take initiative

By JOANNA JOHNSON

Students get mad at the bookstore each semester for escalating book prices. Professors dislike the bookstore nagging them too early for next semester’s book orders. Yet many professors didn’t understand that their timeliness helps the bookstore stock the shelves on time, and keep book prices lower.

Matthew Hobbie, a sophomore employee at the bookstore, told professors what they could do to help students receive and afford books. Hobbie sent out a letter on October 11 to every faculty member that described how they affected the processes of ordering and pricing books.

This semester, the bookstore witnessed a 70 percent increase over last year of professors turning their book orders in by the deadline. Well over half of them requested next semester’s books by the October 20 deadline.

In Hobbie’s letter, he detailed how the prompt or tardy return of a professor’s book orders determines if a book arrives on time for classes, the buy-back value of the book, and how many used books the bookstore receives.

Availability: As Hobbie explains, the sooner a professor turns in his or her book order, the more time bookstore employees have to research and obtain books. More time is also needed to obtain books from overseas.

Buy-Back Value: Many students wonder why they receive so little money when they sell back their books. Hobbie also explains that students can sell back their books for half of their original price if professors give the bookstore their orders early. If the book orders are late, students receive one-third of the original value of the book at most.

Used Books: Lastly, Hobbie details that wholesalers sell used books on a first come-first serve basis. Therefore, earlier book orders increase the chance of receiving more used books. When students buy used books, they save 25 percent of the book’s original value.

Hobbie explains that his letter targeted “those who wait simply because it does not seem important.” He explains that some factors keep professors from turning their requests on time, but many other professors do not realize the urgency of their early book selection.

Some professors admit the letter clarified why the bookstore asked for requests so early. Associate Professor of Political Science Dr. Brian Shaw says, “It was helpful because it reminds us why we have to get [the order] in as early as we do. The insistence of the bookstore seems arbitrary, but now we know it’s not arbitrary. It’s helpful to bookstore employees, which is important, but students are also adversely affected by professors turning them in late.”

Department Chairman and Professor of Art Dr. Larry Ligo stated that though he probably would have turned his request on time, he would have waited longer if he had not read Hobbie’s letter. “Human nature being what it is, I probably would have waited until the last day; but when I read it and saw the argument, I did it right away,” he states.

Hobbie thinks that the excellent response to his letter shows that professors are concerned about students. Hobbie states that he was “very heartened” by the results and is “just really happy that people did pay attention to [the letter] and it shows that they really care about students.”

The illegal bonfire of Saturday night. File photo

Fire from page I

After the officers asked him three times to do so. After the third refusal Officer Ramsey arrested Matthews, charging him for obstructing operations of the fire department. Ramsey says Matthews was arrested for “resisting and delaying” fire-fighting procedure. Police handcuffed Matthews and escorted him downtown to the Mecklenburg County Intake Center of Charlotte. According to Matthews, he hadn't said anything to the police but that he was "singled out." Matthews, only the second Davidson student to get arrested by campus police, spent five hours in jail, leaving at seven a.m. after friends got together the $250 bond. According to Ramsey, Matthews later admitted he was acting disobediently. Ramsey says, “He just had a little too much to drink.” Matthews, however, says he was not drunk at the time. Says Matthews, "I think the situation was blown out of proportion." Campus police also gave out two alcohol violations to students Saturday night as a result of drunken behavior during the fire fiasco. Though campus police have already received complaints about how things were handled Saturday night, Officer Ramsey says he would take the same actions again. He says, “There were probably others who needed to be arrested,” and realizes that “everyone has a different opinion about what happened last night.” According to SGA President Bill Gullan, Matthews just wanted to know why. Disappointed with the actions taken by campus police in arresting a Davidson student and with putting out the fire, Gullan says: “It’s not often that something spontaneous happens around here, and it is certainly not often that students have such a bonding experience. Unfortunately, in this instance, all that was positive and harmless about the bonfire was hosed down by campus police and the fire department along with the fire itself.” Campus police, including Police Chief Rick Moore, reviewed the situation and compiled an official police report this morning.
