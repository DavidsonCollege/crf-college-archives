**Some Satisfied, Some Not With Faculty Oath Change**

**BY TOM LOFLIN**

As is to be expected after any controversial action, Davidson’s officials and faculty members had different reactions Wednesday after the
Trustee compromise on the faculty oath issue. There were two general attitudes expressed about the compromise: satisfaction, and deep feeling
of disappointment by some that the entire idea of a professorial oath at Davidson was not scrapped entirely.

President D. G. Martin felt that the new oath would strengthen Davidson's Christian commitment. “The new Trustee ruling advances the
date of some professors’ commitment as much as five to twenty years," Martin said. “It will assure the fact that
a large majority rather than a minority of the Faculty will be thus commissioned (will have taken a vow).” Martin
explained that in the past only full professors were required to take an oath and that men often remained on
the faculty as long as twenty years without becoming full professors.

Dr. J. McDowell Richards, Chairman of the Board of Trustees, also expressed satisfaction with the new oath. He felt that
it was an improvement over the old one. “The Trustees by their action made clear that Davidson College is to
remain a Christian institution. At the same time, the Trustees recognized that the method of securing the achievement of this
objective could be improved," Richards said.

Dr. D. D. Rhodes, one of the leaders of a faculty committee set up to recommend abolition of Davidson's oath,
expressed satisfaction at the compromise. Rhodes did not know of the Trustees' action when reached at his home Wednesday night,
but he said upon learning of the new vow ruling, “I think that this is a meaningful change.” Rhodes liked
two things in particular about the new oath: “I think that it is a simple and much more straightforward type
of vow. I like the idea of having it administered during a special religious ceremony before those people who want
to attend. I think the ceremony will be more meaningful than the old ceremony at graduation.” Rhodes said that he
did not anticipate any more action from his committee in the future and said that he thought faculty feelings on
the matter will be improved by the new vow.

Dr. E. F. Patterson did not agree with the new vow ruling. “Any kind of a vow required of professors
at an institution of higher learning is inconsistent with teaching at this level," he said. “I believe that this new
vow hurts worse than the old one simply because it includes more people."

Dr. J. H. Ostwalt, who refused to become a full professor about ten years ago because of his convictions against
any kind of an oath, said that he did not think the situation has been materially improved with the new
vow. “I think any requirement like an oath will prevent the college from getting many outstanding men to teach here.
The expansion of the new oath to include more members of the faculty may even be a larger drawback to
recruiting professors than was the old one," Ostwalt added.

**Trustees Relax Oath But Extend Coverage**

**College Supported On Speakers Stand**

The Board of Trustees in their meeting Wednesday compromised between abolishing the faculty oath entirely and keeping the much-embattled old
one. The result is that the college has a new vow which will be given to all faculty members upon
their acquiring tenure. In addition to changing the form of the vow, the Trustees in their day-long meeting:

- Expressed complete confidence in the college administration in permitting atheist Michael Scriven to speak on campus.
- Approved an official statement of policy for Davidson College (see page two).
- Announced the receipt of an endowment for $1.5 million from the estate of the late Mrs. Walter H. Woodson.
- Approved plans for the remodeling of the downstairs of the College Union.
- Watched President D. G. Martin receive an award from the Department of the Army for “distinguished civilian service.”
- Approved leaves for next year for various faculty members, and
- Approved the hiring of several new faculty members.

The results of the Trustees’ decision on the professorial oath are that the vow will contain two parts instead of
the present three, that the number of faculty members who will have to take the oath will be increased, and
that the time and place for men taking the oath will be changed. The new vow contains the following wording:

“1. Do you acknowledge Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour as revealed in the Holy Scripture and will you endeavor
to live a life consistent with this profession?

“2. Do you dedicate yourself to the vocation of teaching and will you seek faithfully to perform the task of
teacher, to inform the minds of students and to create in them a thirst for knowledge, a love of wisdom,
and a reverence for truth?"

The old oath had three clauses which were considered by many to be open to many different interpretations:

“a. Do you acknowledge Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior and do you believe in the fundamental teachings of evangelical
Christianity?

“b. Do you believe the scriptures of the Old and New Testament to be the word of God, the only
infallible rule of faith and practice?

“c. Do you promise in the humble reliance upon the grace of God, which comes by the Holy Spirit, so
to live and teach as to give expression to the Christian faith?”

Under the Trustee decision, all professors who become eligible for tenure (permanent status as a member of the faculty) will
be required to take the new oath in what the Trustees call “a commissioning service." The service will be held
in the college church during a meeting of the Trustees; and the faculty, students, and friends of the college will
be permitted to attend. Martin said that members of the faculty who now have tenure will not be required to
take the new vow until they become full professors. “Men with tenure will be given the choice of taking the
vow or not," Martin said. “But the vow will not be retroactive. They need not take the new one.”

In the past, only men who became full professors at Davidson were required to take the oath. The oath was
administered to them during graduation ceremonies, a fact which many professors have objected to in the past. In actual fact,
the new oath and procedure for its administration are not yet official college policy. Changes in the By-Laws by the
Trustees must be proposed at one regular meeting so that they can be enacted in the following meeting. The new
oath cannot be put into effect until final approval by the Trustees. President Martin said, however, “The proposal to change
the vow made by the Trustees today is tantamount to their approval at the next meeting. It is possible, of
course, that something could come up so that they might vote not to enact their proposal at the next meeting.”

**Measles Epidemic At Saturation Stage**

**BY BUCK LAWRIMORE**

“Davidson is now experiencing about as much of an epidemic of this kind of measles as it could,” Dr. J.
B. Woods said this week. “Probably as much as four-fifths of the boys have already had them in childhood, and
are therefore immune. As far as I know you can have these German, or three-day, measles (scientific name: rubella) only
once."

Symptoms of the disease, he said, are itching of the skin and possible temperature, accompanied by swollen lymph nodes in
the neck. They are most contagious around the time when they are breaking out in a red rash, but usually
by the time the little bumps are showing, the victim has had contact with a large number of people to
which he could have spread them. From infection to recovery usually takes about three days.

Woods estimated that in the past two weeks there have been some 50-75 cases on campus, some of which have
surely not been reported to the infirmary. That no more cases have occurred despite the contagiousness of the disease is
ample evidence that most students have already had the illness, Woods feels. Only those with irritating symptoms like fever or
sore throats have been kept in the infirmary. All the other itchers have been allowed to run loose, although the
doctor advises the infected ones to be careful.

“Older people have more to fear to contract them now. The older you get the more serious the effects," Dr.
Woods noted. “The disease is especially dangerous to contract during pregnancy. Since they are not so contagious as red measles,
many women do not catch them until adulthood. If contracted during pregnancy, especially the first three months, the child may
be deformed or handicapped, although many babies are born perfectly healthy under such conditions. Measles are not nearly so damaging
as thalidomide," Woods added.

changing the vow today, there was not one dissenting vote." The Trustees, in proposing a new vow, charged the President
of the college or the Dean of Faculty to make sure of the Christian commitment of all prospective members of
the faculty and to discuss the purpose of the college with them, making sure that they are in basic agreement
with the purpose. The Trustee action on the oath came from the recommendation of its Education Committee which has been
studying the matter for the past eight months. The committee worked with several professors appointed by the Faculty, which petitioned
the Trustees last year to review Davidson's oath due to the fact that many favored its abolition. Martin said that
the question of atheist Scriven was raised in the meeting. "The Trustees expressed their confidence in the action of the
administration on this matter." He added, "Their confidence indicates we have a board far beyond the average one in its
understanding of education today."

Mrs. Woodson, formerly of Mocksville, set up a trust fund for the college of $1.5 million, the Trustees learned. Martin
said that income to the college from the fund would be about $60 thousand a year. The award made to
Martin by Arthur T. Port, an assistant secretary of the Army, said in part: "Appreciation is expressed to (Continued On

THE SCARLET LETTER

Slater Slated For Re-inspection

Health Officer Calls For Slater Clean-Up
BY TOM LOFLIN

A State Department of Health inspector looked over the college’s cafeteria Monday and apparently would agree with last week’s DAVIDSONIAN
report on the unsanitary conditions in the kitchen. Inspector Noah Walters removed the health-grade notice and advised Manager H. R.
Bryson to clean up the kitchen by this afternoon, when he was slated to re-inspect the kitchen for a new
grade.

By a phone call to Walters Wednesday night, the details of the inspection were learned. The call was made after
THE DAVIDSONIAN observed that Bryson was not displaying his health-grade notice (an “A” rating). Inspector Walters knew what had happened
to the notice. “I was up there day-before-yesterday (Monday) and checked the place, and it didn't look too good; so
I took the sign down." Walters then went on to tell what he found wrong with the cafeteria and what
he hoped to do about it. "I plan to come back Friday afternoon to look over the kitchen again and
give the place a new rating. I gave the manager quite a checklist of what I found wrong during the
inspection. I am now giving him a chance to clean it up.

"Bryson went around with me during the inspection and saw all that I saw. He said that he was surprised
at some of the things he saw.” Walters said that the worst thing he found during his inspection was the
over-abundance of roaches. The domination of the Slater facilities by these insects was noted in THE DAVIDSONIAN last week. The
inspector said that some of the equipment in the kitchen was old and at times did not perform its functions
adequately. “I also realize that the building in which the cafeteria is operated is quite old,” he added. “However, the
state cannot allow the age of the building and equipment to be an excuse for the filth that I found
during my inspection of the place."

When asked to specify other improper conditions that he found, Walters replied, “Well, the rest of it was just the
lack of cleanliness in general. For instance, there was a lot of grease around that should have been cleaned up.”
Walters indicated that he might talk to several college officials on his visit here today. “I also plan to send
a copy of my next report to the general offices of Slater, if conditions are not improved,” he said.

Walters said that he made his inspection before learning of the DAVIDSONIAN article from a local woman who called him
about conditions at the college's eating facility. “I understand that the paper made the inspection and took some pictures at
night. Well, all I can say is that they didn’t have to wait until night to see roaches on the
walls,” Walters said. “I will guarantee you this,” finished Walters, “I intend to see those conditions of filth in that
cafeteria cleaned up and have it brought up to standard. It may take a while, and I will give a
poor rating if I have to; but I intend to see progress made. That's why I pulled down the rating.”

Both Bryson and Business Manager Robert A. Currie said that they believe the expansion of the eating and dining facilities
programmed for the Union will help Slater provide better service and aid in the sanitation of the kitchen. Currie said,
“By increasing the size and improving the layout of the kitchen, it is hoped that it will be easier to
keep facilities clean and that it will make for more pleasant working conditions. Due to the poor ventilation in certain
areas of the kitchen, on warm days it is almost a sweat-shop.”

Walters, when informed of the college's plans for improving the Union and buying newer equipment for the kitchen said, “I
understand that they plan to do that. But that is no excuse for not keeping their present facilities clean.”

Bryson said that the day before last week's DAVIDSONIAN article, the college had arranged for a pest-control company to spray
the cafeteria once a week instead of once-a-month as it had been doing. He admitted at the time that roaches
were a problem and that the college had not taken successful steps in the past to control them. The inspector
is empowered to close any establishment that constitutes a health menace, and if today's inspection reveals that insufficient progress is
being made toward improving conditions in the Slater cafeteria, either the health rating will be lowered, or a number of
people may be looking for a new place to eat on Saturday.

U. S. Sets Crackdown On Savings Bond Chain

The federal government has ordered a crackdown on the latest series of circulating chain letters that involve US savings bonds.
In an opinion handed down by the Post Office Department at the end of last week, such chain letters were
declared illegal even though they do not pass through the mails. The order for a nation-wide enforcement of the postal
lottery and fraud laws accompanied the above statement by the postal authorities.

Last November and December a number of Davidson students became interested in originating some of the letters; however, the “fad”
has since left the campus. The Post Office Department disclosed the greatest activity in the states east of the Mississippi
River. Their spokesman said that even if letters are transferred by hand, the methods are illegal if the proceeds—that is,
the bonds—are sent through the mail. Also, the Treasury Department has ordered their State directors not to sell savings bonds
when there is suspicion of a chain-letter scheme.
