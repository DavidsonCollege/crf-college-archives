The movie Lewis continued from page 11

the cast as well, particularly Winger. She gives a solid performance as the American poet whose honesty and intelligence come across as too direct and abrasive for English convention. She manages to create a very palpable character, one who is much more than just a catalyst for Lewis’ rebirth. At the same time, Winger does not outshine Hopkins, whose character is the focus of the movie.

Richard Attenborough pulls all the artistic stops to enhance the message of his film. The musical score is beautiful without being ridiculously melodramatic. The cinematography gives us breathtaking scenes of Oxford’s gothic buildings and the sprawling English countryside. Even contrasting light and shadow are carefully manipulated. In one particular scene, Lewis sits in his attic, shrouded in shadow, as he speaks with Grisham’s son, who is seen in the light. Here the viewer sees a visual representation of Lewis’ isolation and of the emotional obscurity he has maintained for so long. This picture contrasts the young and innocent boy who has constructed no such “shadow” for himself yet.

Many will come away from this film depressed. Indeed, Lewis experienced more joyous times in his life. But it is this time which caused him to grow. Even before he actually had experienced it himself, this is the axiom he is showing: pain yields personal growth. Attenborough uses Lewis’s personal story to illustrate the fact that one’s life necessarily will be filled with both suffering and happiness. They come hand in hand. Furthermore, the director makes no apologies for this seeming ambivalence toward life, for it is, after all, the truth. Though harsh, his unabashed truth-telling proves very refreshing. After all, whose life is ever completely free from trouble? Hollywood endings just don’t happen in real life. As Grisham explains to Lewis while she ponders her own mortality, “The pain you feel later is part of the happiness you feel now. It’s part of the deal.”

SPEAKERS

Still Whistlin' Dixie
8 seconds is too long
By Geoff Graham

After the enormous success of the Pure Country soundtrack (due not only to the exceptional music, but also to George Strait’s phenomenal performance), I expected great things from the recently released original motion picture soundtrack 8 Seconds. The album touts such artists as Pam Tillis, McBride & the Ride, Billy Dean, and Mark Chesnutt, but despite the heavyweight backing, still falls far short of my anticipations.

The best songs on the album are admittedly pretty good. McBride & the Ride’s been on CMT for quite a while with “No More Cryin’” and hit the radio a few weeks ago. An incredible bass line and catchy lyrics make this a hit. Pam Tillis hits the mark with her rodeo/relationship analogy “Pull Your Hat Down Tight.” She sings “Bound to be a hard night tonight / Baby pull your hat down tight.” You can interpret that one for yourself. Surprisingly, Brooks & Dunn produced the final good tune on the album. “Ride ‘em High, Ride ‘em Low” is, yes, another rodeo song (have you figured out what the movie’s about, yet?) in the tradition of “Boot Scootin’ Boogie.” Think of a gritty, upbeat “Amarillo By Morning.” As far as the rest of ‘em go, Vince Gill sings a decent remake of “When Will I Be Loved,” but he’s got a long way to go.To match the original:

Reba McEntire sings just another Reba McEntirish song in “If I Had Only Known.” Mark Chesnutt let me down with “Texas ~~ Sxacily—pr thetic songs about Texas. I’m sure such songs do well in the Lone Star State, but when they’re no good, people just cringe and change the station (that’s a message for all those superstars out there who read my article). I can’t really condemn Billy Dean’s “Once in a While.” I’m sure the producers made a mistake. This song had to be written for a Disney movie, and accidentally made it onto a country soundtrack. I have to give John Anderson an honorable mention. I really don’t like most of his music, but if I did, I’d probably like “Burnin’ up the Road.” It’s kind of like “Money in the Bank,” but well written. I know this review doesn’t promote the movie, but don’t let it turn you away. I’ve seen the video for “No More Cryin’” and I’ve seen the preview on television. The movie will be good. I really doubt it could be anything as groundbreaking as Pure Country, but it will certainly make headlines. Luke Perry stars as rodeo legend Lane Frost with Cynthia Geary (from “Northern Exposure”) and Stephen Baldwin. John Avildsen directs (Rocky, Karate Kid) and Michael Shamberg (War of the Roses, A Fish Called Wanda) and Tony Mark (The Fisher King, Nowhere to Run) produce. 8 Seconds (formerly 8 Seconds to Glory) hits theaters in a couple weeks so keep an eye out for Scott’s review and be ready to high-tail it out to Movies at the Lake. I’ve got a big truck, so if you can’t find a ride, give me a call.
