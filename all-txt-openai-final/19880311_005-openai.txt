**ANNOUNCEMENTS OF WRITING COMPETITIONS**

The Department of English is sponsoring three writing awards this spring. All entries should follow general guidelines for submission and
must be the original work of the applicant. Entries must be double-spaced (single spacing for poetry is acceptable), and must
appear on one side of the paper only. The name of the writer must not appear on the manuscript. Name,
address, phone number, and title should be included on a separate piece of paper. Entries must be submitted to a
member of the English Department by 5:00 p.m. on Thursday, March 31, 1988. Awards will be presented at the annual
literary awards ceremony on Thursday, April 21, 7:30 p.m., in the 900 Room of the College Union. All entrants are
expected to attend. Specific guidelines for the individual awards are outlined below.

**The 1988 R. Windley Hall Writing Award**

The R. Windley Hall Award carries a first prize of $50.00 and second prize of $25.00. Manuscripts will be screened
by the Department of English and the final judging done by an outside reader.

The R. Windley Hall competition is open to any regularly enrolled freshman at Davidson College. All entries must be original
work and may fall in any recognized category of creative writing, such as fiction, drama, poetry, or the essay. Essays
written for English 21 classes may be critiqued by faculty members and revised for final submission. Students may submit as
many entries in as many different categories as they wish. Poems should be submitted as groups rather than as individual
entries.

When you fill out your Form W-4 or W-4A, “Employee’s Withholding Allowance Certificate,” remember:

If you can be claimed on your parent’s or another person’s tax return, you generally cannot be exempt from income
tax withholding. To get it right, read the instructions that came with your Form.

**The 1988 Vereen Bell Memorial Award for Creative Writing**

The Vereen Bell Award carries a first prize of $75.00, a second prize of $50.00, and a third prize of
$25.00. The judge this year is the distinguished North Carolina novelist, Lee Smith, author of Black Mountain Breakdown, Oral History,
and Family Linen.

The Vereen Bell competition is open to any regularly enrolled Davidson College student above the freshman class. All entries must
be original work and may consist of fiction, poetry, or drama. Students may submit entries in as many different categories
as they wish. Poems should be submitted as groups rather than as individual entries.

**The 1988 Charles E. Lloyd Writing Award**

The Charles E. Lloyd Award is presented to the sophomore, junior, or senior who submits the best piece of prose
non-fiction. Forms may include academic writing (e.g., term papers, original textual analysis), personal essays (e.g., descriptive, narrative), persuasive essays (e.g.,
argumentative, analytical), and satire/humor. An outside reader will judge the entries on the basis of prose style, originality, clarity, structure,
and substance. Entries are limited to a maximum of 15 typewritten, double-spaced pages, containing one to three essays.

**ACTION, from p. 4**

istic society for those ruthless enough to own it. But along the way to his goal he enjoys his mistress
Ashley (Vanity) and the other miscellaneous fringe benefits of organized crime. Absolute power has left him empty of human emotion.
His only pleasure lies in his perversions. Dellaplane is an easy man to hate.

Vanity also lives up to the audience’s expectations of her. Having played in Prince’s Purple Rain, one would not expect
her to act. But, having appeared in this month’s Playboy, one might expect a peek at her sultry body, which,
in fact, she makes no bones about displaying before the cameras. She has the silliest role, the most absurd lines,
and the talent of a nearly paper-trained Labrador retriever. But who cares?

paraplegic jokes.

“What do you call a man with no arms and no legs in a pile of leaves?”

“Russell.”

“What do you call a man with no arms and no legs on a wall?”

“Art.”

What do you call a man with no arms and no legs on the floor?”

“Mat.”

And so on. But as a film in its genre it comes far short of inspiring any kind of admiration
for it. Action Jackson, as a stereotypical action movie, does not have enough violence or enough car chases, although Vanity
supplies the endeavor with hooters galore. If Vanity is your fantasy, Action Jackson is your movie.

**BABY, from p. 4**

She’s cute as a button and sexy as a kitten. An actress with such interesting features and a lack of
shyness needs no talent.

In all, the movie has some interesting minor characters, which one might anticipate finding in such a place as Detroit:
They bring an air of authenticity and a spark of vivacity in an otherwise trite and hackneyed film. And, in
all honesty, some moments do salvage this film from total perdition. For instance, in one scene the viewer has the
chance to brush up on his

like Grant’s in Arsenic and Old Lace or Hepburn’s in Woman of the Year - then - please see this
film. Howard Hawks was, until his death, one of the premier figures in American film comedy. This film is one
of his best.

Bringing Up Baby. Starring Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant. Directed by Howard Hawks. Shows on March 12 and March 15
in Love Auditorium at 8 p.m.
