THE NORTH CAROLINA GAME

Unquestionably “It wasn't our day,” to use the expression of one who was closely watching the game with North Carolina
last Saturday. A person couldn't point out any reason “why” the game was going as it was and yet—it was
undoubtedly true. We all knew full well that every man on our team was giving the very best that was
in him, but against Davidson was a new Carolina—a team which had been defeated and humbled, brow-beaten and abused, and
now, with the Virginia game scarcely ten days away, they arose in all their power and strength and played as
they have never played before. They played hard, and deserved their victory.

But when the last whistle had blown, every Davidson man, with his faith in the team fully as strong as
ever, formed in line and with the old-time “pep” marched back through town with more spirit than is many times
shown after a victory. This is the evidence of the true Davidson spirit, which shows that Davidson stands behind her
representatives in victory and in defeat.

It has been a good season, and now all eyes are turned toward the Wake Forest game on Thanksgiving. This
game is always full of interest—to see if Davidson will be able to keep unbroken the long line of victories
over that institution, and this year it is looked forward to with special interest on account of the class of
ball that Wake Forest has been playing. We but echo the sentiment of the campus, the faculty, and the alumni
when we say that never has there been a greater feeling of loyalty for the team and our coaches than
is now present on the eve of the final game of the season.

CIVIC LEAGUE FLOWER SHOW

Tuesday, November 9, the ladies of the Civic League held in their hall a flower show. Chrysanthemums and ferns were
much in evidence and exceptionally beautiful. Mesdames Elliott, J. N. Thompson, and Withers had the most beautiful displays. Miss Bonnie
Shelton presided at the lemonade counter. Mesdames Brady, J. W. McConnell, Shelton, and W. R. Grey supervised the attraction, and
many visitors found their way during the hours of 3 to 9 p.m. to the Civic League rooms and enjoyed
the spectacle.

LETTER OF APPRECIATION FROM DR. SHEPHERD

Dr. Henry E. Shepherd, who spoke here on Davidson College Day last year, in appreciation of what Davidson did for
him as a student, and because of the affection he has always felt for her, writes:

“In every stage of her development from her very origin, Davidson has maintained her academic integrity inviolate, and has kept
herself unspotted from the temptations which in no sphere of our contemporary life assume a more malignant form than in
the educational world. In seasons of exigency, in periods of revolution, she has never failed to adhere to her lofty
ideals, in scholarship, as well as in the moral sphere. At no time has she become a worshiper of theSensuous
and of the material, or sacrificed her purity in the absorbing quest of the things which perish with the using.
Blending into harmony faith, reverence, comprehensive and wisely guarded acquirements in literature, science, and philosophy, the college can assuredly claim,
as it assuredly deserves, the support, co-operation, and generous patronage of the church with which it is associated and of
the country in which it serves as an enlightening and inspiring power.

OLD PUBLICATIONS FOUND.

In a recent search in the old library, Miss Shaw discovered several copies of a magazine, and two issues of
a paper, whose publication dates back many years ago. The magazine found was “Davidson Monthly,” “devoted to Science, Literature and
Art.” It first appeared in 1870, sixteen years before Volume I of the Davidson College Magazine. It was a student
publication, which fact makes it the ancestor of THE Davidsonian rather than of the Magazine. “The Davidson Monthly” lived only
two years, and all the copies have been found except those for October 1871, January 1872, and February 1872. The
paper discovered was “The Davidson College Enterprise,” but only two copies of this have been secured, these being for January
18 and February 1, 1884. This is a small four-page weekly, and was published by a student as a money-making
scheme. Hence it was not a regular student body publication. It contains news items and contributions on various subjects from
students.
