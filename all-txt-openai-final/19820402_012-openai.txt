### An Old-Time Rocker Learns a New Trick

The names that come up in conversation read like a well-stocked album library: Ron Wood, George Harrison, Fleetwood, Jimi Hendrix,
Elvis. Mylon LeFevre has played with, toured with, made albums with, and co-written songs for many of the greatest performers
in the history of rock. His career began in 1962 when Elvis recorded a song he had written; the next
year, 126 groups were recording Mylon’s songs. He broke with his gospel-music family in 1968 to form a band called
Holy Smoke, and in 1970, he began cutting his own albums. He later teamed up with Alvin Lee to form
Ten Years After, which included Fleetwood, Harrison, and Ron Wood (who was then still with the Faces but later joined
up with the Rolling Stones). Mylon has done several solo albums since a recording company dispute broke up the band,
played with the Who in the movie Tommy, cut another album with Leon Russell, and continued to write songs for
himself and others. So how did he wind up being slated for a concert at Davidson with a band with
the improbable name Broken Heart?

To LeFevre, the question is answered simply: “When you make the commitment to share God every day of your life,
you gotta expect Him to use you where and when He wants.” He admits, however, that that statement isn’t as
meaningful unless understood in the context of his own life and the personal struggle he has undergone. Like many others
in the music world, he had a severe drug problem; in 1974, while strung out on heroin, his heart stopped
in the middle of a concert and, after being revived, he spent seven months “drying out” in a hospital. After
that experience, he quit heroin but still had an enormous habit in other drugs, particularly cocaine. His music got worse
and worse, he says, because he was constantly muddleheaded.

The decision to drop the whole drug/music scene came after a New Year’s Eve concert in 1978/79 with ARS at
the Fox Theater, where he was loaded “out of his mind” on cocaine.

While LeFevre doesn’t claim to any “road to Damascus” experience, he still knows he had a clear-cut choice. “I was
literally killing myself,” he says, “and I realized after the concert at the Fox that I had really tried every
way of living except one.” The difference for him is marked. “My voice is stronger, my mind clearer, and my
music is better. I’m thirty-seven now, but I feel younger than when I was thirty.”

When pressed about his future, Mylon says: “Well, I’ve already made several million dollars and spent that much in the
past fifteen years, but it was nothing.” It was meaningless to him; he wasn’t buying anything worthwhile or necessary or
helping anyone with that money. Now he wants to “put everything on the line for God,” and he is willing
to “gamble” all that he has for Him. “It’s all very simple,” believes Mylon. “If God is worth serving, then
He’s worth taking chances for,” whether in Mylon’s case that means his music, money, acclaim, or whatever else. His latest
album on MCA/Songbird is part of that commitment to give everything he has for God’s work. It marks a departure
from all of his previous work in its explicit Christian message, but the music itself is still hot (the MCA
people were so excited over the album, Brand New Start, that they pushed back the release date from October until
April in order to give it a bigger push). Already invitations are coming in for appearances ranging from the PTL
Club to TV programs such as Solid Gold. “The possibilities are awesome,” says LeFevre.

### After the Show

Opening their first set with an instrumental number, I was immediately aware that the band had come to play some
serious rock. And with over five and a half tons of sound equipment, it was apparent, too, that they knew
they were good enough to be heard. Lead singer and songwriter Mylon LeFevre, excited despite the small attendance, invited everyone
to come to the front of the auditorium, then explained himself a little. “We don’t apologize at all for the
music we play,” he said. “We’re a rock band.” But the qualification he added was interesting: “We are here to
worship the Lord, and we don’t think that we’re gonna be able to witness to Him best by playing music
we don’t enjoy. Oh, we do some soft stuff, but we like to go at most of our music hard.”

Probably everyone in the audience was aware that the band loved playing their music; they weren’t satisfied, however, just to
play, even though the message in the songs was explicitly Christian. It was very important to the individual members as
they introduced various songs to tell why they believed in what they sang. Bass guitarist Kenny Bentley spent five minutes
explaining why the song “To Be Real” deserved to be heard. “It’s only life in Christ that makes you real,”
he told us, then took off on the upbeat melody (which is one of the nine cuts on their new
album).

After a few minutes break, during which the band adjusted some equipment and informally mixed with the crowd, Broken Heart
opened the second set as well with an instrumental number that featured an incredible back-and-forth guitar lead. “We like to
open our sets with an instrumental number ... just because we like to,” LeFevre laughingly intoned as the song concluded.
Six to eight more numbers transpired in the same manner as the first set (i.e., intermingled with jokes and sharing).
