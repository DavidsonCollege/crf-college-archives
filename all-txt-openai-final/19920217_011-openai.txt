Trees Are the Answer
By Matthew S. Cox

I think trees are the answer,
yet many people don’t even care.
Just stop what you’re doing and stare...
they’re everywhere.

Some big, some small, some round, some fat.
Imagine that, a tree that’s fat and round,
and yet they barely make a sound.

Some will droop and others sway,
they bend back and forth, back and forth, on windy days.
Just lay there... lay there in their shade.

Trees don’t mind the animals that dwell
in their trunks, branches, and leaves.
The little bugs and birds in nests,
none of which are considered pests,
live on and in many trees, even... bees!
Some keep snakes and lions and squirrels,
some have vines that twist and twirl.
I’ve even seen it house a little girl.

If I had a magic wish,
I think I would like to be a tree.
I’d stand majestically tall and see all I could see,
but that’s just me.

I can imagine children swinging from my branches,
doing all sorts of little dances,
or men coming to me for wood.
I’ll give them all I can, it’s important to me.
I should, I could, I would.

If we will all be trees for a while,
giving more so others will smile,
I’ll see in this world of bitterness and strife,
more meaning to our wonderful life.

The Slice of Life
By B.J. Rudell

Along when I was old enough
to venture on my own,
to travel on paths paved and rough
where very few had roamed,
I seized the chance
to enhance
my inexperienced years,
and traded city smog and soot
for a frolic with the deer.

My journey adjourned in a hidden clearing
off a road where no one went by,
where you could lie on your back in the evening
and soak up every star in the sky.
All my gold spent,
I set up my tent
and set out to gather for food,
to celebrate my new-born freedom,
offering all the fruits of their labor.
The gentle breeze
put me at ease.
I followed the light of the moon
back to my fort in the clearing
where birds sang a wondrous tune.

A rabbit nudged my side
so that I wouldn’t oversleep,
and kindly offered his hide
to supply me that day’s meat.
The flowers in bloom
released sweet perfume,
filling my thankful lungs
and purifying the precious air
for a tiger licking her young.

I sprawled out, atop the turf,
to steal the attention of the sun,
extorting the giver of life’s worth,
leaving the rest of nature none.

Then the earth
became a great hearse.
A grave replaced the garden.
All that was beautiful ceased to exist
while the grass began to harden.

The trees disintegrated before my eyes,
the wind tore into my skin.
Circling the dead were ravenous flies
where light-hearted bees had once been.
The flowers burned;
the sun turned
away from a world now bare.
I was left to live the slice of life
of a man who takes more than his share.
