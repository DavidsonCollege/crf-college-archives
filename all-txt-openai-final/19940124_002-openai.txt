**Two returning and four new professors to teach this semester**

By Jeff Kent

This spring semester at Davidson will see the arrival of several professors who will assume both temporary and permanent positions
with the college faculty. In addition to the return of Cherie Clark and Audrey McCulloh, four new faculty members will
be introduced to Davidson this January.

Susan Roberts will teach courses in the Political Science department this spring, filling in for Mary Thornberry while she is
on sabbatical. The native North Carolinian graduated from Wake Forest University and received a Ph.D. from Notre Dame. Roberts brings
an expertise in American politics to her job. She has completed considerable work in the arena of legislative politics and
with the role of women in the political system. Her recent projects include writing a book on the deliberation of
political questions in congress. In addition to teaching classes this semester on “The Presidency” and “Parties and Interest Groups,” Dr.
Roberts will join the faculty in a permanent capacity next fall.

The English department welcomes Stephen Sandy this term as the McGee professor of writing. The Yale University graduate earned his
Ph.D. from Harvard. He has held a position at Bennington College since 1969, as well as visiting appointments at Harvard,
Brown, the University of Rhode Island, and the University of Tokyo. Sandy has published several collections of poetry, 13 chapbooks,
numerous essays, reviews, and a recent book called Thanksgiving Over the Water. Sandy’s translation of Seneca’s play “Hercules Oetaeus” should
be published soon by the Johns Hopkins University Press.

Another visiting professor, Andrew Smith, will join the faculty as an associate professor of biology this spring. Smith graduated from
Dartmouth and received his Ph.D. from the University of North Carolina. Dr. Smith specializes in animal adhesion, the mechanics of
how animals stick to rocks in turbulent intertidal zones. He has researched extensively the mechanics of animals generating negative pressure
in water and has done a post-doctoral fellowship related to that specialty in a French lab.

The chemistry department welcomes visiting assistant professor Elias Ed-Zovinka. Zovinka, a Connecticut native, studied at Roanoke College in Virginia before
receiving his Ph.D. from the University of California-Davis, where he studied heme degradation. Currently, Dr. Zovinka engages in post-doctoral work
at North Carolina State University, where he studies vanadium peptide chemistry. This semester, Zovinka will educate non-chemistry majors in an
introductory course and run an introductory lab for majors.

**Reduced faculty course loads mark final transition from quarter system**

**Will fewer classes taught mean fewer choices for students?**

By Court McBryde

Davidson professors’ yearly teaching load will be reduced to five classes in the fall of 1994. This change completes Davidson’s
transition from the quarter system to the semester system. In 1986, it was proposed that professors’ yearly teaching load should
be reduced from six classes to five classes. Dean of Faculty Dr. Robert Williams explains that this transition has been
gradually worked in over the past year. According to Dean Williams, the decision to implement the final phase of teaching
reduction is an “administrative decision and not a faculty matter entirely.” Williams explains that professors currently teach a five and
a half course load. In turn, the graduation requirement of the class of 1994 is 33 credits. With the reduction
of the teaching load to five courses, the graduation requirement will be reduced to 32 credits for the class of
1995.

A teaching load of five courses is “an industry standard among liberal arts colleges,” and the new policy “brings Davidson
into conformity with other colleges,” Williams remarks. The final implementation of the teaching load will also help recruit new faculty,
Dean Williams added. Williams comments that the five-course teaching load is not a sign...of devalued teaching. Williams stresses that “teaching
is a broad concept,” which encompasses many facets. He explains that “research, advising, and being accessible” create the equivalent of
at least one extra course. Religion professor Dr. Alexander McKelway comments that now, as opposed to 10 or 15 years
ago, a lot more is expected out of college professors. He explains that now professors have a lot of “internal
office work and external scholarship demands” that require more time of faculty. With this new teaching load, professors’ “energy and
time will not be reduced, but thought and quality will increase,” McKelway notes. McKelway expresses his concern about how the
full shift to five courses will be administered in all departments. He comments that the transition is hard for departments
with classes that require specific prerequisites. “You can’t take out the building blocks.” Mathematics department chairman Dr. L.R. King comments
that staffing the upper-level classes in the math department will be difficult because they have to teach lower-level classes. McKelway
explains that even though the number of courses offered to students will be reduced, Davidson will make the effort to
fund more faculty positions. Dean Williams agrees on this matter. He notes the increase in the size of the freshman
and sophomore classes, explaining that Davidson will hire faculty if needed to offer the necessary classes.

Faculty retreats to reflect on spirituality
By Beth Lindsay

Davidson faculty and staff confronted the complexities of teaching in a Presbyterian college at a weekend retreat in Montreat, North
Carolina, January 14-16. College chaplain Rob Spach explains that the retreat, which was sponsored by the chaplain’s office, called staff
members to “reflect on what they’re doing here as a vocation.” It served as an opportunity to reflect on the
role of spirituality in society and on Davidson’s campus. Participants were asked to recognize “the variety of callings among people”
and to seek to discover what they can do within the realms of their chosen vocation. The retreat was led
by John Killinger, a scholar, writer, and pastor of religion and culture at Samford in Birmingham, Alabama. Killinger addressed such
topics as “seeing as the basis of redemption, the feminist factor, and feeding as a metaphor for a vocation.” An
informal gathering began the retreat on Friday evening. Over the weekend participants attended three workshops which included reading, discussion, and
lecture. A morning worship service concluded the retreat on Sunday.

The Montreat retreat was first sponsored by the chaplain’s office seven years ago to address the practical relationship between Christianity
and the mission of the college. The retreat was only intended to be a one-time event for faculty members. Participants,
however, found it so worthwhile that it eventually evolved into an annual event including all staff members. Participation was down
this year, due partly to the extremely cold weather, but those who attended thought the retreat was a fruitful time
of discovery and personal growth.
