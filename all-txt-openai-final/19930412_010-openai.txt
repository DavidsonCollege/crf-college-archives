The Shenandoah Shakespeare Express Brings Play to Life

By Allison Wright

The Shenandoah Shakespeare Express presented Bill at his finest Thursday afternoon in the 900 room. With its fast-paced, contemporary, and often humorous version of Antony and Cleopatra, the company, composed of 12 energetic young actors and actresses, brought the play to life. Performing in authentic Shakespearean style with minimal sets and costumes, a protruding stage, and natural lighting, they added creative touches (such as their trademark hightops) to modernize the drama and make it applicable to young audiences.

The minimalist costumes by Dana Tietje were especially effective. An occasional flash of color in a scarf, a striking white military jacket, or black bikers’ gloves were layered over black shirts and pants to creatively distinguish the characters without distracting from the substance of the play—the action, expressions, and most importantly, the words themselves. The group let Shakespeare’s language speak for itself through their talented delivery. Impeccable diction, perfect timing, and boundless energy established the actors and actresses as truly professional, not to mention versatile, performers, as some played up to four different roles.

Most impressive was the performers’ ability to infuse the tragic story of Antony and Cleopatra’s ill-fated love with so much humor and slapstick, while still delivering the passionate death scenes in Acts IV and V with depth and emotion. Productions that can achieve this blend of tragedy and comedy with as much finesse as the Shenandoah Shakespeare Express are rare.

About five years ago at James Madison University, Ralph Alan Cohen, the director of Antony and Cleopatra, co-founded the Shenandoah Shakespeare Express along with the managing director, Jim Warren. In their program, the SSE says that “replicating the original conditions of Shakespeare’s theater produces the energy, muscularity, and pace that make the plays work like new entertainments.” Operating under this belief, the company now tours all over the country performing and leading classroom workshops on Shakespeare’s language, stage, and acting. Their performance delighted the audience and hopefully they will visit Davidson on their next tour.

Poetry ... Jennifer A. Neale

In His Sanctuary

In a quiet sanctuary he sits with his pen and paper—
with his brown cravat and dark tweed slacks.
In his silent sanctuary he can yet hear the sounds outside of himself—
the taunts, the jeers, and everything that tells him he is false.
A mutant presence.
He is not wanted, though he is a part of it all.
He cannot break the structure though his ties grow weaker—
jolt after jolt—
always in conflict with the heavy heavy body.
His arms stretch out and out, holding...
And will they separate these bindings?
Will they snap under the weight of his beard?
He does not dare ask.
He does not dare move from his precarious position.
Yet still he grows heavier as the food for despair invades his soul,
as the silence wraps itself around him,
And hispen and paper fall to the floor. And his hands cover his eyes, cover his nose, cover his lips, as he again suppresses his cries. Jennifer Neale won the 1993 R. Windley Hall Writing Award.
