Pikas Squeeze Past Spiking SPEs
By HOWARD BOYD
Sports Writer

The SPEs, behind the spiking of Buzz Tarver and Larry Spears, had won the first match 15-12, 15-13, handing the Pikas their first loss in the double elimination tourney.

Thus the Pikas, who had saddled the SPEs with their only loss in a previous match, were forced to play a second match before copping top honors.

The SPEs made it three in a row in the first game of the final match, 15-12, but behind the play of Gary Scibal, John Pecorak, and Gordon Graham the Pikas roared back with a 15-6 romp in the second game.

The third game was nip-and-tuck, and the score was tied 14-all with the SPEs serving, when Graham made a saving scoop shot to give the Pikas the serve. They scored immediately to wrap up the championship.

Questioned about the game, Hudson said, “It was a good comeback, but our defense needs some work.”

The ATOs captured third place in the tournament, while the Sigs garnered fourth.

Meanwhile, IMAC softball got underway with three games on Monday. Centerfielder Jim Hudson lashed a two-run single in the bottom of the seventh, capping a seven-run rally and propelling the Machis to an 11-10 triumph over East Club. Hudson's hit plated Kelly McKee with the winning run. Junkballer Phil Dotts went the distance for the Machis, while Mitch Purvis was tagged with the loss.

The hard-hitting Hudson, a prime candidate for league all-star honors, also smashed a solo homer and another single, while John Saunders, Herb Clegg, and Reif Kessler each collected two hits for the winners.

In other games Monday, the Sigs blasted the KAs 9-0 and the Gamms won over the NUs on a forfeit.

Sponsors Film

The film will be shown at 9 p.m. Sunday and again at 8 p.m. Tuesday in Perkins Auditorium. The film is intended to give students some idea of how soccer is played and an introduction to the strategy of the game.

Pierce Makes Collegiate Track Debut

Though the recent Davidson-Pembroke track meet may have been little short of disastrous with the Cats losing 90-50, it marked the debut of Davidson's newest thinclad Billy Pierce.

Pierce has played as a freshman for Terry Holland's basketball squad for three years, but this is his first effort at collegiate track. Pierce said he had never worked out before last Thursday, as a matter of having nothing else to do.As a point against Pembroke, he placed fifth in a field of six in the 880-yard run with a time of 2:02 in the same event. 

Sports Spotlight

Sherrill’s Jewelry added a third for Davidson with a time of 2:02 in the same event. Davidson gridiron players will play their annual spring game this year against an all-star alumni team. The game will be played on May 22 at Davidson.

According to Tom Scott, director of athletics at Davidson, the Wildcats will meet Appalachian on Oct. 2. This is the first year a varsity-alumni game has been scheduled, the spring game usually being an intra-squad contest.

In high school, Pierce and his brother Don were literally track stars. Pierce participated in the 880-yard run, the mile run, and the broad jump. Don ran the 100-yard dash, the 220-yard dash, and the 440-yard dash. They were also on relay teams. In their one-meet career, they had quite the track record.

Last week, Rick Pipan, a pitcher for the Davidson baseball squad, was named Sportsman of the Week by the “Greensboro News.” Freshman football coach Gene McEver was honored as an all-time All-American by the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity last week. The award was presented by Varsity coach Dave Fagg in a ceremony at Davidson.

The soccer club will host one of the Charlotte amateur clubs for a game on April 17.

Track coach Sterling Martin first became interested in Pierce when he won the 660-yard run in IMAC track. Martin said, “I can’t say what time I got my time down to or not,” Pierce stated. “That’s really one of the reasons I’m running, to see how well I can do. I’ll be able to work more on running,” Pierce said now that basketball is over.
