### April 30, 1931

**Inconsistencies of opinion, arising from changes of circumstances, are often justifiable.** —Webster.

**Sport Page:** McCallie
**Page Six:** Guerrant

#### PARAGRAPHICS

Anyone who particularly enjoyed the hurdle events, which were practically all-Davidson, with George, McCallie, and Little all placing in both
events.

It won't be long before the Seniors will begin studying for their last examinations. Let’s give them an opportunity to
make good on them by keeping as quiet as possible during the period.

The campus is at its most beautiful stage now. We hardly realize the picturesque beauty of our surroundings until we
compare it with that of other places.

Davidson men will be interested to know that Lees-McRae College, in Banner Elk, N. C., has been given full Junior
College rating by the State Department of Education.

Some generous soul was kind enough to send us an article on the use of words. Wish that he would
make himself known so that we may personally thank him, as we realize our dire need for such instruction.

R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. announces that prize winners in its fifty-thousand-dollars contest will be announced next week. Several men
are expecting to receive registered mail in the next few days.

In case someone doesn’t know the meaning of the heading of the new column, we will give you the definition
the columnist gave us. According to him, it is translated “News Paragraphs.”

#### MOTHER’S DAY

Countless volumes have been written on mothers, their love, and things associated with mothers, but it is agreed that even
this is not enough to say in love and reverence of the one to whom everyone owes such a debt.
Mere words cannot express the feeling of a son for his mother. There are many times during each year that
we realize the things that our mothers have done for us, and wish that there was some appropriate way of
showing our gratitude. One day only in each year is set aside as one especially dedicated to mothers. This seems
a small recognition of the enormous obligation that we owe them. That fact alone makes it absolutely necessary that we
give, as much as is possible, that day to them. It is an opportunity for every man to show, in
some way, his devotion to his mother, his thankfulness for all that she has done for him, all that she
has meant to him. At college, especially when distance prevents a great many men from being at home on that
day, the problem is even more acute. Letters, telegrams, gifts are familiar methods of showing one’s love, but they cannot
take the place of personal association on that day. The Y. M. C. A., in its regular program of vesper
service, has secured a Davidson mother.

#### ANOTHER EXPERIMENT

Haverford College has now made its addition to the plethora of reforms which recent criticism has produced in American college
education. The current trend, in fact, would seem to indicate that it is a mean institution which cannot offer some
program of innovation in response to the demand for greater efficiency in our modern educational system. Experiments of a more
or less radical nature are in process in every section of the country (with the possible exception of South Carolina
and Virginia) in an effort to justify the time and money involved in the pursuit of higher education. These sundry
proposals boast all grades of theoretical merit, and time alone can tell which will have permanent influence on American campuses.

The Haverford plan, involving a view which is steadily gaining acceptance, predicates what has been termed a “reasonable inclusive aristocracy”
of college students. Only the fit can be admitted, and their fitness is to be assured through an adequate selective
process and personal interviews. Unable to accommodate the throngs beating a path to their gates, our higher institutions of learning—for
the time, at least—must regard their benefits as a privilege rather than an “inherent right.” And quality rather than quantity,
though a completely un-American principle, is the essence and support of the new Haverford system.

The really unique feature of the project is the adoption of the individual as the unit for instruction instead of
the group. Each upperclassman is to be placed under the supervision of a qualified professor for guidance with recognition of
his particular needs and abilities. The mental, however, is not to be emphasized to the exclusion of the physical. Every
student will take some part in three sports, “one of which he can continue to engage in in mature life.”
With its new methods, Haverford expects to turn out well-balanced, carefully developed personalities instead of the somewhat veneered products ground
from our present educational machines. Aside from the fact that it apparently presents the problem of a choice between small
student bodies or unwieldy faculties, the plan is definitely appealing in its simplicity and promise of effectiveness. There are a
practical theory and purpose behind it which invite confidence, and its principle should receive consideration in the search for tomorrow’s
process of college education. —Duke “Chronicle.”

#### CHANGES

It is with a sense of doubt that we announce that The Davidsonian appears on Wednesday beginning with this issue.
It is at least certain that this edition will be dated Wednesday. We remember the compliment which the past editor
paid to the Shakespearean players, who failed to appear for their performance; and we hesitate to make any such definite
statements. But, unless unforeseen accidents occur, the paper will be in the post office on Wednesday afternoon. The staff is
hopeful that this change of custom will meet with the approval of the student body, as the alteration requires a
great deal more work of the members of the staff.

With the next issue of the paper, an exchange column of about half a column will be run. It will
contain items of interest concerning the various colleges in the South which are familiar to Davidson students. One reason for
the addition of this column to the make-up of The Davidsonian is to give news of interest from other places.
Of course, the Intercollegiate Press fulfills this purpose to a certain extent, but it is centered more on the nation
as a whole rather than on the Southland, as this particular feature purposes to do. Perhaps the more important reason
for this new inclusion is that the editor feels that one column of editorial matter is enough to expect anyone
to read. It is rather disheartening to glance at the editorial page and find two columns of ideas and opinions
of the editor.

In the concluding issue of the year, a pictorial edition is to be run, showing, in addition to the leaders
of the campus for next year, some scenes of the campus. The pictures are to be run in brown ink
which will give an effect at least different from that given with black.To speak Sunday evening, on a special “Mother’s
Day” program. As a tribute to our own mothers, every man who is on the campus at that time should
attend this service and dedicate at least that much time to those who are due so much more.

Socialism Nicaragua Vetoed Advertising

A new wage system has recently been adopted by the Soviet Government whereby each mine, factory, railroad, etc., will have
the duty of fulfilling its own contracts and the right to raise or lower wages in proportion to the output
of that individual industrial unit. This new arrangement has been criticized by a large number of people, and they have
even accused the Russians of making “a compromise with capitalism.” But this accusation is not in any way justified, for
socialism involves planned production for use and not production for profit as in capitalism, and this change of methods does
not in any manner make profit the object of production. It is merely a human device to speed up production
and hasten the development of the socialistic state. It is foolish to even suggest that Russia is turning capitalistic.

“If statistics tell anything, they show that business has turned the corner.”—Roger W. Babson.

Because of the banditry which is taking place on the Atlantic coast of Nicaragua, Secretary Stimson has warned all Americans
in the interior of that country to withdraw, for they “must not expect American forces to be sent inland to
their aid.” We “cannot undertake general protection of American citizens throughout that country with American forces.” To do this, it
seems, “would lead to difficulties and commitments which this government does not propose to undertake.” The United States has had
forces stationed in Nicaragua for the last twenty years because they had a “fatherly” interest in maintaining law and order
in the country on account of its relation to the Panama Canal and because the U.S. has held, since 1916,
a treaty right for the proposed Nicaraguan canal. The government has even encouraged Americans to enter Nicaragua, specifically committing itself
“to ensure the adequate protection of all American interests in Nicaragua, whether they be endangered by internal strife or by
outside interference.” Since Americans have gone into Nicaragua with the above understanding, it is but right that they should expect
the amount of protection which could reasonably be expected that any government would give its citizens under similar circumstances.

The election of a painter of international repute as associate in the Royal Academy has been vetoed by the president,
Sir William Llewellyn, on the grounds that one of the paintings submitted by the artist was merely an enlarged photograph
thickly painted over. The artist admitted the act but denied that he knew there were rules forbidding the use of
the above method.

Great Britain’s “greatest advertisement” is again in London. Upon the arrival of the Prince of Wales in his native country,
Prime Minister MacDonald sent him the following message: “May I express the loyal greetings and welcome home which the whole
nation wishes to offer your Royal Highness and Prince George on your return today.”

“Man is like a tack—useful if he has a good head and is pointed in the right direction—but even though
he is driven he can only go as far as his head will let him.”—The Kodak Magazine.

If Senator Stephen Douglas and President James Buchanan had not quarreled over the slavery question, Douglas would have been the
Democratic nominee for President in 1860. If Douglas had received the solid support of his party, he would have defeated
Lincoln in the election. If Stephen Douglas had been President in 1861, he would not have given the South any
reason to leave the Union, thus the Civil War would have been averted. Therefore, we see that it was really
the hatred of Buchanan for Douglas which caused this four-year war, that is, if we believe what George Milton of
the Chattanooga News tells us.

“Sterilization is not a punishment but a protection. It carries no stigma of humiliation. The imbecile mind is criminal and
you can’t breed it out. The beginning of wrongdoing is hereditary and starts in the secretive actions. By preventing reproduction,
one of the basic causes can be cured.” So declared Governor Murray of Oklahoma as he signed the bill to
sterilize the hopelessly insane. This state is the fifteenth state in the Union to adopt this legislation.

Notwithstanding his right, Alphonso XIII seems to be left—Louisville Courier-Journal.

The saddest story we have heard of lately is of the absent-minded professor who jumped from an aeroplane and didn’t
open the parachute because it was not raining—The De Paula.

A copy of the first edition of “Tom Sawyer” fetched $1,225 at auction in New York last week—just about one
day’s pay, if we may believe the gossip, of the youth who plays the hero’s part in the screen dramatization
of the story.—Boston Evening Transcript.

SPRING

The annual race between weeds and vegetables is now well under way, though still a little underweight. But then there
is always a brighter side. Spring is seldom as slushy as the poetry it inspires. Wow!

“What’s the use of going to school anyway?” sez me. But we should remember that the little red schoolhouse is
better than the little-read citizen. We don’t want to be as ignorant as the schoolboy who thought that “foreign entanglements”
meant “spaghetti.” That reminds us of the guy who went into a highbrow restaurant, pointed to a line on the
French menu card, and told the waiter to bring him some of that, to whom the waiter responded, sorta sweet
and candid, “Sorry, sir, but the orchestra is playing that.” But college has its disadvantages as well. Pipe this conversation
we overheard the other day:

Furst: “I started out, after I graduated from college, on the theory that the world had an opening for me.”
Seccun: “And you found it?”
Furst: “Well, rather! I’m in the hole now!”

OUR BOOK-OF-THE-WEEK SUGGESTIONS

Now, as the automobile instructor said to his pupil, “Let’s run over a few things together.” This is for the
purpose of getting through with this column as soon as possible if not earlier—We could print a lot of jokes,
but you’d only laugh at them—and this is a respectable column—we don’t want anyone to die laughing—(Ed. Note: Don’t worry.)

TRADE MARK TRIOS

“What made Pontiac that way?”
“He asked La Salle for a date and she said it was Willys Knight.”
“That’s twice she’s worked that Dodge on him. Did he reBuick her?”
“Not after she laid her little Auburn head on his chest and—well, you know what a Kissell do.”

RHETORICAL REPARTEE

John Jackson to Bill Smith did say,
Like Samson I my thousands slay.
Yes, cried his partner, ’deed you do,
And with the self-same weapon, too.

IF BILL S. HAD ATTENDED COLLEGE:

Fresh “A Comedy of Errors”
Soph “Much Ado About Nothing”
Junior “As You Like It”
Senior “All’s Well That Ends Well”

QUESTION AND ANSWER DEPARTMENT

Dear Mr. A-SAP:
Here is a note that I received from a friend of mine, a Math Professor. It is entitled, “To A
Lady Who Asked Professor Z_------------ for a Cypher.
You O a O, but I O thee,
OO no O, but O O me.
O let, then, my O my O be,
And give back O O I O thee.”
Please tell me what you make of it. I don’t want to appear dumb.
Yours, Ruth Boaz.

Dear Miss Ruth:
Following is the answer to the cypher:
“You sigh for a cypher, but I sigh for thee,
O sigh for no cypher, but O sigh for me.
O let, then, my sigh for my cypher be,
And give back sigh for sigh—for I sigh for thee!”
(Ed. Note: Ruth, surely, is stranger than fiction).

TODAY’S BEST STORY

A man was walking by a graveyard one evening and heard a strange noise. Being a kind old gentleman, he
sauntered over to find out what the trouble was and saw a poor man, weeping and tearing his hair, prostrate
upon a grave, sobbing, “Oh, why did you die? Oh, why did you die?”
“What’s the matter, my good man?” he asked.
But the poor man just sobbed again and again, “Oh why did you die?”
“Who died?” asked the kind old gentleman.
The poor man raised his head and with tears in his eyes and broken voice answered, “My wife’s first husband.”
