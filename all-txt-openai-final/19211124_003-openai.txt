CHRISTIAN ACTIVITIES

MINISTERIAL BAND HEARS SECRETARY BLANK ROBERTS
Bland Roberts, a graduate of Vanderbilt University and traveling secretary of the Student Volunteer Movement, spoke to the Ministerial Band
Sunday afternoon on the subject “Making Christ Real.” Mr. Roberts emphasized the fact that doing good is an ideal only
to the philanthropist, while the task of making Christ real to others is or should be the ideal of every
Christian and especially of every minister of the Gospel.

In order to make Christ real in one’s life, every stronghold of selfishness must be thrown wide open and one’s
whole life and will surrendered wholly and entirely to God. This is utterly impossible if one is to arbitrarily choose
his own field of work and give himself up to the selfish idea that he would not be able to
serve in any other field. God has a plan for every man or else He would never have made him.
God alone can tell a man just what that plan is. Hence to fill the place which God has made
for an individual, that individual must seek God’s plan for his life without reservation as to the nature of work
which he personally would like to do or as to the field in which he would like to serve.

J. C. WOOL AND ALBERT WILDMAN ON VOLUNTEER DEPUTATION
Last Sunday J. C. Wool and A. C. Wildman were sent on a deputation to the Methodist Church of Cornelius
by the Volunteer Band. They both spoke on the subject “Full Time Christian Service,” especially emphasizing work in the foreign
field. The Epworth League has full charge of one service each month in this church, and it was that service
at which they spoke. F. C. Sherrill, ’24, is doing some excellent work as president of the Epworth League.

TWO MOVING PICTURES ARE ON THIS WEEK’S SCHEDULE
This week two pictures are on the movie bill, “Experience” on Wednesday night, and “After the Show” Friday night. Both
of these pictures are recent releases. “Experience” is based on George V. Hobart’s play. Richard Barthelmess has the star role
as “Youth.” Marjorie Daw takes the part of “Love” and Kate Bruce plays as “Youth’s Mother.” The general opinion of
the critics seems to be that the play might have had a better director than Fitzmaurice.

“After the Show” is the story of two Americans at Oxford. This play is directed by William de Mille, who
is a follower of the “literal” school of directing as opposed to the “impressionistic.” Jack Holt, Lila Lee, and Charles
Ogle are the main actors. Many Davidson students remember Ogle as the cock-fighting farmer in the “Jucklins,” shown here last
spring. The story was written by Rita Weiman, the author of the story of “Footlights.”

T. J. Hutchinson, ’04, is in home missionary work in western North Carolina. Rev. J. M. Williams, ex-'14, has moved
from Palmyra, Mo., to Godwin, N. C.

DR. WRIGHT LECTURES
(Continued from page 1)
Can one convert a man? No, but God converts men only through human agencies, and man’s part lies in putting
himself unreservedly at God’s disposal, to be used as an agency. Has prayer an important part in the winning of
a man? Prayer is the whole thing, not that we must stop there, but through listening in prayer...As well as
speaking, we can learn ways and means of getting a man closer to Christ. At this point, Dr. Wright stressed
forcibly the value of the morning watch. Is all this practical? Who shall be approached? How can one be a
friend and win the lost person to Jesus Christ? If impractical, it would not be worthwhile. Approach the man or
men whom God tells you to approach. He will certainly tell one who prays earnestly in a listening as well
as speaking attitude, and your opportunities and usefulness increase as you go along. Practice alone makes perfect. There are four
ways of winning a man: formal persuasion, direct action, nurture, processes of friendship. The last of these is the most
useful and practical for us, there being four main processes of friendship: gift, self-revelation, wounds of love, vicarious suffering. The
last of these never fails, but needs not to be used often. Wounds of love are sometimes necessary, so one
should not be afraid to lose a man’s friendship in order to be his friend. If one reveals himself, his
friend will most certainly do the same, and he will have the opportunity to tell him of Christ in a
very real way. Forty percent of the non-Christians of America would be touched and won if every Christian were absolutely
generous, not nursing a bit of selfishness and pride. But what must a man do after he is won? He
must do three things: make full retribution for wrongs done in the past, surrender unreservedly to Christ, and witness for
his new Master. It is felt that through his powerful addresses during his visit to Davidson, many have become more
vital powers for Christ. From here he went to the University of North Carolina and from there back to Yale.

MR. BLAND ROBERTS GIVES STRONG CALL FOR SERVICE
(Continued from page 1)

“Find it,” found in Matt. 10:39, was quoted. Mr. Roberts, being so recently a student himself, could speak as a
student to students, and his directness and earnestness in presenting his subject greatly impressed his hearers. In closing, he quoted
the following:

“If Jesus Christ is a man,
And only a man, I say
That of all mankind I cleave to Him,
And to Him will I cleave alway.

“If Jesus Christ is God,
And the only God, I swear
I will follow Him through heaven and hell,
The earth, the sea, and the air.”
