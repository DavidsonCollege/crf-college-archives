**Women’s Tennis Claims Victories On The Road**

By PATRICIA HAHN

Senior Co-captain Eleanor Knobloch’s description of the Davidson women’s tennis team as a “good traveling team” proved an understatement the
weekend of April 14th. Shunning all Spring Frolics festivities, they traveled to Atlanta and to Boone to defeat three schools
in three days.

The longer of these two days was Sunday. Beginning at 9 a.m., the team shut out Emory University with a
9-0 victory. Coach Caroline Brown regarded this match as an excellent win, adding that Emory is considered to be one
of the stronger teams in Davidson’s division. Calling on all possible energy reserves, the team then proceeded to play and
defeat (6-3) Southern Birmingham University the same afternoon. Again, Brown credited the team with an outstanding performance. She cited in
particular the victory at number one doubles for partners Caroline Barclay, a sophomore, and Knobloch. In three sets, 6-3, 6-3,
6-3.

**Greek Week Guys And Gods**

By HUNTER GOURLEY

There has been something big happening at Davidson College every week now for over a month. I get burned out
just thinking about it all. We've had the Twins and the Stoneshow, even an Easter Holiday. The Rusk formal fell
in there somewhere, and finally for all you baggers and groupies there was Greek Week. When to study amidst all
of this hoopla?

The Greek Week frat-frenzy began this past Monday and peaked Wednesday evening behind Vail Commons with the singing of songs.
The brothers of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity felt compelled to turn out for the singing this year: they needed a
fifth place finish to win it all and become (very) mythical Greek gods in their own right for a year.
The SAEs played it safe, crooning out such traditional old favorites as “All Hail! O Davidson!” and then their own
fraternity song. Their strategy proved successful and despite the fact that the Alma Mater sounded more like “Aw Hell! Oh
Davidson,” their efforts were enough to please the judges, especially Chalmers Davidson.

Senior guitar player and songwriter Bobby Silver led the KAs to a first place finish in singing and a second
place overall in the final tally for Greek Week festivities. Their rendition of the Silver original, “I Came to the
Big D With High Hopes of Frat Life” sung to the music of the Hee Haw theme song was matched
in originality and spirit — if not in actual vocal caliber — by a new Mick Smith tune. With less
beer in a few Phi Delta Theta bellies and a little more practice, it might have really challenged Silver and
his merry band of “Milk Drinkers.”

The KAs were a hard act to follow though, especially after singing lines like, “At the end of the court
I found the KA House / Milk and cookies (were) there waiting for me. / True etiquette, mint juleps, and
fine southern ladies / (All) In the tradition of Robert E. Lee.” With this song they got vengeance against those
naughty Phi Delts who had vowed earlier to let no KA group ever win an air band contest.

The SAEs began the week by losing to the KAs in basketball (once again). Reports will attest to the fact
that they played fairly well, considering the absences of their big name IM-AC players and the unfortunate waiving of the
rule that the fouling team must chug beer. The SAEs did finish second in basketball and they won the bowling
to end the day.

In Tuesday’s competitions, renowned KA frisbee enthusiasts, Dave Dendy and Scott Huie, helped their Ultimate frisbee team to victory over
the Pi Kappa Alphas, leaving third place for the SAEs. Later that afternoon, big-throated Phi Delts were busy competing against
a miracle team consisting of Jim Cox, Newton Quantz, Ed Henderson, and Ben Williams, who quickly drank the SAEs to
glory and into first place for the beer chugging contest. Sigma Phi Epsilon finished second in the event.

Again on Wednesday, the SAEs stole the thunder from last year’s Greek Week gods by beating the Delts in their
second clash to clinch first place for the tug-of-war event. Henderson, Cox, Ralph Steding, Roger Gore, and Peter Janneta comprised
the winning tugger’s team against a very light but strong group of Delts featuring Dan Blood, Bob Miller, and Ernie
Andrews.

Headball finished out the afternoon’s activities and dragged on into the early evening. Fortunately, there was sufficient beer and mud
to last the duration. The competition went to the wire between...PiKA and SAE before Wallace Goodman saw fit to end
the match at 15-13 for a PiKA victory. Headball ended about the time the singing began up at the Commons.
Congratulations to guys and gods. 6-7, 6-1, they upset South Birmingham’s prized doubles team. Following these two decisive wins, the
weary athletes packed the van and headed for the hills. They awoke the next day to yet another victory, the
defeat of Appalachian State University, 6-3. Barclay felt this two-day sweep was not enough and added, “Luckily we are in
superior physical condition because we had to push the van up through the mountains to reach Appalachian and then play
the match.” Admittedly, this statement was made after a long, arduous match last Wednesday, and its contents are not yet
fully documented. Just two days after their return home, the lady netters faced an away match against longtime rival Furman
University. Last year Davidson took the match with a close 5-4 victory. This year the numbers reversed positions and Davidson
lost 5-4. Tied 3-3 after singles, Davidson’s number one and number three doubles teams dropped their matches in three sets.
This photo-finish emphasizes that the match could have gone either way. To close out the season, the women met Appalachian
again this past Tuesday and UNC-G the following Wednesday. A more decisive victory (8-1) was the lady netters’ home match
response to A.S.U. Entering the UNC-G match, Brown acknowledged the importance of this match toward a bid for nationals. UNC-G,
Brown knew, was a school with which Davidson would be closely compared by the Nationals Selection Committee. To end the
season as gracefully as they had begun, Davidson won 9-0. Though criticized by other teams for playing home matches on
clay, the Davidson lady racketeers proved their skill on all surfaces under various conditions. Both Brown and junior Tricia Ives
point out this team’s “adaptability, versatility, and ability to overcome obstacles.” Combine these qualities with the team’s obvious talent and
join them in this week’s anticipation of an invitation to the Division III National Tennis Championships, May 7-12 in Kalamazoo,
Michigan. The list of hopefuls reads, in order: Barclay, Knobloch, senior Adelyn Lutz, sophomore Holly Johnson, Ives, and freshman Debby
Podolin.

Wildcats Enter Tourney With Impressive Season Resumé
By KERRY BROWN

The regular season has come to an end for the Davidson men’s tennis team but, as far as the Wildcats
are concerned, the best part of the season has just arrived. Davidson travels to the Southern Conference Tennis Tournament this
week at Johnston City, TN, and the Wildcats bring with them an impressive regular season resumé. The Cats are 15-8,
third in the Southern Conference, after winning five straight conference matches and seven of their last eight of the season.
Davidson also has an attack arsenal that will easily put the Wildcats in contention for a third or fourth place
finish in the tournament. The tournament picture looks real good for the Wildcats. “The guys are confident,” said Coach Jeff
Frank describing his team as they looked toward the tournament. “We played on the courts up there a week ago.
So, we also have confidence on the courts,” Frank added. The Wildcats should have confidence after humiliating East Tennessee at
Johnston City, 8-1. The recent court experience will be a very small advantage for Davidson. After all, East Tennessee played
on their home courts much more than the Wildcats but, in the end, better players overcame court conditions. Davidson’s top
adversaries in the tournament are Furman and the University of Tennessee-Chattanooga. Furman destroyed the Wildcats earlier this year 8-1, but
since then the Paladins have played over 25 matches. Frank believes the Paladins are never up to par in the
tournament. “They're all tennised-out when tournament time comes around. They play so many matches,” Frank said. The University of Tennessee-Chattanooga
defeated Davidson 8-1 also, but the difference between the Mocs and the Paladins is that the Mocs were undefeated going
into the last week of their season. UT-C and Furman, who both have blistering roadrunners on the court, will probably
be battling it out for the Southern Conference Championship, but Davidson is a dark horse which could run away with
a second place finish if Furman or UT-C slip from their pedestals. “Everyone is playing well, and we anticipate a
top three or four finish if we play up to our potential,” Frank said. The Cats are playing well, the
Cats have confidence and, with a lot of luck and good tennis, the Davidson Wildcats might have a chance to
become the 1984 Southern Conference Champions.
