The Class of 2003 has arrived

COLLEGE COMMUNICATIONS

Davidson's Class of 2003 began classes on Monday, August 23, well-prepared for the culture they joined through four days of
orientation activities. Besides meeting each other, the 458 first-year students were introduced in whirlwind fashion to more administrators, faculty members,
extracurricular opportunities, and academic programs than they could ever be expected to remember.

But the orientation overview also gave them grounding in the core values of the college they will share, and gave
them a first common experience on which they can begin to build friendships and trust. Davidson’s orientation is far more
extensive than that offered by most colleges and universities, giving entering students an extended chance to bond as hallmates and
classmates before upperclass students return to campus. It gives parents a full day-and-a-half to learn about what their students will
experience at Davidson, and it gives students ample time to become comfortable in their surroundings before classes begin.

While first-year international and minority students, and student residence life staffers, came together for special orientation sessions up to four
days earlier, Orientation 1999 officially began Thursday, August 19. Coming together from 40 different American states and 21 foreign countries,
members of the Class of 2003 lined up outside the College Union that morning to run an initial gauntlet of
stations both serious and silly. In addition to receiving their “Cat” identification cards, laundry numbers, and student employment assignments, they
donned costumes for a photo, took the freshman juggling test, and received their first Davidson “kiss” (a Hershey’s kiss, that
is!).

A large corps of upperclass “Orientation Team” members was on hand at the residence halls to help them haul their
luggage to their new rooms. Students assigned to the upper floors of the residence halls especially appreciated the assistance!

Dean of Admission and Financial Aid Nancy Cable and Vice President for Student Life Tom Shandley welcomed both students and
parents in Love Auditorium. They learned that they represent 350 different secondary schools, with 50% from public schools and 40%
from independent schools. They were hailed for their academic accomplishment. Nearly 60% who reported class rank were in the top
5% of their class and 96% were in the top 20% of their class. Those enrolled were selected from 2,824
applicants, and were specifically tapped not just for high classroom marks, but for well-developed talents in areas such as art,
music, athletics, leadership or service.

Just over half of them received need-based, merit-based or athletic-based financial assistance. The average need-based financial package was $14,000, the
average grant aid was $12,500 and the average merit-based award was $8,720.
