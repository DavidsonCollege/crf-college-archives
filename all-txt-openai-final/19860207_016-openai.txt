"WHAT’S UP
PLATO?

A FELLOW PHILOSOPHER. HE
WANTS TO PROVE THAT A HARE
MAY NEVER OUT-RUN A TORTOISE.

PROMETHEUS, THIS IS ZENO.

AHEM. YOU SEE — IF THE
TORTOISE STARTS AT POINT
A, AHEAD OF THE HARE, BY
THE TIME THE HARE REACH-
ES POINT A, THE TORTOISE WILL BE AT
POINT B. AND BY THE TIME THE
HARE REACHES POINT B, THE TORTOISE WILL
BE AT POINT C. AND SO ON...

OH, I SEE.
BY THE TIME THE
HARE GETS WHERE THE TORTOISE WAS, THE HARE
CAN NEVER OUT-RUN THE TORTOISE. NOW
ZENO’S ASSISTANT WILL START THE
RACE. YOU AND I WILL BE AT THE
FINISH WITH THE
GREAT MASTER
HIMSELF.

WHAT’S THE
CLUB FOR?

HIS INDIRECT
PROOF AGAINST THE
HARE’S WINNING.
