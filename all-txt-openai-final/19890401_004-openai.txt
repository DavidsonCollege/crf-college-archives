THE DAVIDSONIAN.

At an enthusiastic meeting on Wednesday night, March 18, the Davidson College Student Body voted for the establishment of a weekly newspaper. Later, an editor and business manager were elected and a staff appointed. The present issue is the first fruits of this action. “The Davidsonian” makes its initial bow.

In the inauguration of such a newspaper, many questions no doubt arise. “Why a college weekly? Does it have a real value? What will it stand for?” The newspaper is largely what its name implies, composed of news. It should be in close touch with every phase of College life and the life of the community about it. Even in a small college, life becomes more and more complex, and as the students are broken up into an increasing number of groups, there is a tendency not to look beyond the questions and matters in which one man is directly interested. The college newspaper should give live information about every group and department of college activity, keep them acquainted with each other, and thus promote a feeling of mutual interest and encouragement. In addition, there are the things which vitally concern every student, and yet which are not well known or misunderstood.

But the boundaries of a college are not the limits of its campus. In close contact with it every day is a community which is certain to influence and be influenced by the student. The town column should make every man feel that he has friends in the town, and their interest in the college should be increased by the weekly items and topics about it. The old Davidson spirit which has held sway at Davidson in tradition and fact for years upon years goes with the graduate that leaves her. He scans the daily paper for any stray paragraph of Davidson news, and grips with a loyal clasp the hand of a Davidson man. The Davidsonian should go to the home of every alumnus, let him know what is going on every week at his alma mater, and unite undergraduate and alumnus, alumnus and alumnus in one common purpose—the upbuilding of Davidson.

But the newspaper should not merely report events. It should not be content with gathering news of our teams away and accounts of matters not generally known, for the interest of the readers. This indeed is an important and a large part, but a tremendous factor in student life is what is called student opinion. This must be represented fairly and truly on all vital matters which confront the college and concern college welfare. Yet the paper must not follow blindly. It should lead, not lag. It should mould, not be moulded by the sway of campus opinion. It should stand for the best things in every line. This may necessitate occasionally a firm but kind criticism, which, however, often removes an obstruction and clears the way for more concerted and faithful effort.

The Annual is the yearly mirror of college life as it is, a large edition of “Life” in student language. The Magazine is the monthly expression of the literary talent of the college. The weekly newspaper will not encroach on either of them; rather it will strive to advertise and strengthen them. But it needs exactly what the other publications must rely upon, the support of the students and of the friends of Davidson. With your constant and real help, it can be made newsy and strong. It can bring to you all the latest happenings of interest in the college and town. It can increase the spirit in athletic, literary, social, and religious life here; it can be a link between college and community, alumni and alma mater. The Davidsonian asks for your earnest cooperation.

THE TOWN.

The Davidsonian wishes the town to feel that it has part in the paper, which is interested in its affairs and growth. Every week there will be a column of local happenings, and any notes or suggestions for this will be welcomed. Davidson has had no town newspaper. Will you not give The Davidsonian the glad hand?

CRITICISM.

It would be an abnormal newspaper that did not elicit much comment upon its first appearance. The Davidsonian will suffer the same fate. You will talk about it as soon as you see it, and again when you have read it. But there is criticism and criticism. The criticism that is sinister, careless, and thoughtless will injure the paper; the criticism that is open, helpful, and thoughtful will do more than anything else to build it up. We ask for your criticism, free, candid, and suggestive. Tell us how we can make The Davidsonian better. Give us your constructive, not destructive, criticism.

THE TEAM.

A team with a pitcher who can hold his opponents hitless for nine innings, and with almost errorless fielding through ten innings, is a team which will do big things before the season is over. Now, if ever, the baseball team deserves the hearty backing of every loyal Davidson man. The enthusiasm at last Thursday’s game was the best manifested for a long time, but it reached its climax too late. More organized cheering should be done, and the best practice on it for the big games later will be during this week’s game on the Hill. With every man solidly behind the team, in spirit andIn truth, it promises fair to be well started on a glorious season.

We are grateful for the hearty support and encouragement of the faculty in beginning the newspaper.

There are no persons outside of the college so interested in all its events, activities, and progress as the “home folks.” Fold your “Davidsonian” and slip it in your next letter to them. They will read it as much as you.

The office room of The Davidsonian in 19 South Chambers has been furnished and arranged, and will be open for half an hour after both dinner and supper. You are always welcome—if you can bring some news or subscriptions, give some suggestions, or help in any way.

MANY NAMES SUGGESTED FOR THE NEWSPAPER.

“What is it to be called?” The Davidson Hornet, Topics, Life, Forum, News, Red and Black, Messenger, Weekly Observer, Haka-Raka, Hummer, Electron, Tattler, Echo, Spirit, Oracle, The Davidsonian—these and many other names from serious to near-frivolous were suggested, talked of generally, and discussed. The Transcript and The Blue Stocking were handed in by two members of the faculty. The Davidsonian was finally selected as inclusive of everything at Davidson, every phase of College activity, Davidson spirit, and the Davidson community. It is the name, moreover, of every Davidson student and alumnus, and as namesake should be supported by all. The following submitted the name “The Davidsonian”: W. H. Neal, F. L. Harkey, W. C. Rourke, M. A. Boggs, W. W. McComb, Z. A. McColl, A. R. Howland. W. H. Neal won the free subscription, and the remaining men free tickets to the moving pictures.

MANY ALUMNI EXPECTED COMMENCEMENT.

A large number of Davidson alumni are expected at the coming Commencement. Not only will they have the pleasure of returning to old familiar scenes and reviving old memories, but the two upper floors of Georgia Dormitory are to be vacated by the students for them especially at this time. The College and town will provide conveniences.

J. M. Rogers (’13) was on the Hill for a few days last week. Mr. Rogers is new in the employ of the John A. Hartel Book Company and doing well in his work. While here, he secured nine Davidson men to act as agents for his company this next summer.

NEWS ABOUT TOWN.

The many friends of Mr. Jackson will be glad to hear that he has recovered from a severe attack of mumps which has kept him from his duties for the past two weeks.

The house of Dr. J. M. McConnel is being rapidly constructed, and in the course of a few months Dr. McConnel expects to occupy it.

During the past week, there has been a series of services held at the Presbyterian church twice a day, which have been greatly enjoyed by the community. The services were led by Rev. W. S. Wilson, of Mooresville.

Miss Alice McCullas, of Raleigh, is visiting here for a few days as the guest of Miss Ann Payne.

Several Ford automobiles have been sold here recently, the purchasers being Messrs. A. P. Sweets, John Hovis, and Marshall Potts.

The funeral services of Mr. Lik. Glasgow were conducted here Monday by Rev. Mr. Rolston, pastor of the First Presbyterian church of Charlotte. Mr. Glasgow was pastor of a charge three miles from here for ten years, after which he moved to Davidson while his sons attended college. Mr. Glasgow is survived by five children, Messrs. John Glasgow, H. W. Glasgow, B. W. Glasgow, Mrs. Lloyd Osborne, and Mrs. Irwin.
