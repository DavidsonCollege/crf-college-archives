#### Playing Soccer in the Puddles

**After a St. Andrews tie, 'Cats crush Queens 9-0**

By SPIDER WORMUTH

The women’s soccer team battled the elements and their opponents to gain a tie and a win this week.

On Wednesday, in the middle of the cold downpour and amid huge pools of standing water, the Lady Wildcats fought
to a 1-1 tie with St. Andrews.

In the first half, despite the conditions which generally frustrated all attempts at skilled play, Liz Clarke played a perfect
through ball to the onrushing Maria Tucker who finished nicely past the St. Andrews goalkeeper. For the rest of the
half, the standing water kept the teams battling in the middle of the field and the half ended with the
score at 1-0.

As the teams took the field for the second half, the playing conditions were getting progressively worse as the rain
had continued all of halftime and would continue the entire match. Offenses were generally frustrated due to the now ridiculous
size of the pools of water on the field, but with about 20 minutes remaining in the game, St. Andrews
was able to break away into the Wildcat penalty box. The ensuing melee in the mud slick just in front
of the Wildcat goal ended in the ball trickling into the goal. For the rest of regulation, the ‘Cats put
a great deal of pressure on the St. Andrews goalkeeper who would make some key saves to send the game
into overtime.

The two 15-minute periods of overtime passed with much of the same waterlogged and frustrating battling as had marked the
entire game; and for all they had endured, the Lady Wildcats would only tie.

Maybe it was just that sense of frustration, or maybe the simple disdain for Queenies, but whatever it was, the
Davidson women’s soccer team would crush Queens 9-0 the following Saturday. What more needs to be said? The domination was
complete from start to finish. Queens largely failed to penetrate the halfline, let alone get a shot off in the
first half. By halftime, the score was 5-0. In the second half, they managed to shoot twice, but the ‘Cats
would score four more times. Leading Davidson’s scoring were Maria Tucker with three, and Jenni Stott and Lindsey Forsythe with
two each.

#### Wildcat Dynasty Crumbles; Team Falls 59-13 to Ferrum

**You win some big, and then you lose some big**

By GIGGY MAXWELL

Nero would have loved it. He could have fiddled to his heart’s content as he watched the Wildcat dynasty crumble.
All those in the stands could do was sit in awe as the Ferrum Panthers greeted Saturday’s Parent's Weekend crowd
by demolishing Davidson 59-13.

Ferrum’s offensive output was nothing short of unstoppable. Six hundred yards total of offense. Had it not been for the
fact that the endzones at both ends of the field impede one from rationally progressing any further, several Ferrum running
backs would still be cruising down I-77.

Davidson knew from the outset that it would have problems containing Ferrum’s backfield. Their starting tailback is Chris Warren, a
name you might remember because he was a freshman standout at the University of Virginia two seasons ago. Had Warren
ever been able to find a classroom at UVA, Davidson's defense never would have had to contend with his 119
rushing yards on 9 carries, all in the first half. But they did and they couldn’t stop him.

The one place the Wildcats did contain Warren was on punt returns, largely because Davidson punter Topher Hardin was told
all week to practice kicking the ball out of bounds. Warren had run back a punt for a touchdown on
several occasions this season and the Wildcats didn’t need any other headaches. The strategy paid off. Seven of Hardin's eight
punts were never even fielded and netted a healthy 32 yards a piece.

Of course, those who witnessed the one punt that was returned will never forget it. A 38-yard punt settled into
Warren’s hands at the Ferrum 20-yard line. He then proceeded to run to his right, give one Wildcat a concussion,
leave four others reading the bottom of his shoes imprinted on their chests, and drag another Wildcat ten yards before
shooing him away and scampering 80 yards into the endzone.

Since Warren was no longer in the backfield in the second half, the rushing chores were given to a handful
of his understudies, most notably Fred Stovall and Carl Coles. Stovall carried the ball 8 times for 61 yards and
2 scores and Coles turned his 3 carries for the day into a mere 122 yards rushing. Not bad for
second string.

As the Wildcats were trying to contain Ferrum’s offense, their own offense showed some bright spots. Going away from their
running tendency, QB Peter Hughes threw the ball 26 times Saturday, completing 15 for two touchdowns, one to WR Kearns
Davis and another to TE Tony Lambert.

TB Bryn Robinson was the lone Wildcat rusher who was able to move the ball as he gained 69 yards
on 14 carries.

Coach Gatto also had to be pleased as Mike Rogers recorded 16 tackles from his new linebacker slot.

This week’s opponent is Wofford, the only team the Wildcats had beaten under Coach Gatto prior to this season. However,
Wofford is vastly improved while the Wildcats are vastly depleted.

This week’s injury report:
- Frank Watson (Concussion) is day to day

Record Watch: Freshman kicker James Brown’s Field Goal total remained at seven, two shy of the record, as he did
not attempt one in Saturday’s game.
