YOU DON’T

HAVE TO

The reason is we're not just your average bank. We're C&S, The Citizens and Southern Banks in Georgia. And we're booming. We're working in everything from corporate finance to residential real estate.

And that's where you come in. You see, a bank that’s doing so many different things needs many different skills. So it's not a traditional image we're looking for, it's that certain motivation that marks the leader.

Good grades... yes, they're important, too. But we're also interested in the extra-curricular minded person—the kind who gets into things and makes things happen.

If that’s you, there's a chance you can make it big in a bank that's making it big: C&S. We're number one in Georgia, and in the top forty nationally. Our assets just topped the two billion mark, a 75% increase over the last five years.

Our base is Atlanta and other cities in Georgia.

In the next few days our representative will be on your campus. Call your placement office for an appointment with him now.
