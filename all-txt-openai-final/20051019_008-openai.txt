DAVIDSON'S NEWS FOLLOWER

Davidson College Republicans
and the Environmental Action
Coalition are scheduled to discuss,
among other things, President
Bush’s new energy plan in an
upcoming debate. In order to
increase visibility and interest in
the event, the groups have recently
announced a twist in the format.

Following a traditional back and
forth on current environmental
issues and the implications of the
new energy plan, the two groups
will decide the winner of the
debate with a BattleBots match.
BattleBots matches are held in a
caged arena and are between two
robots that have been constructed
to destroy each other. A winner is

declared when one robot can no

longer function, or until everyone
is tired of watching two robots
fight each other.

The idea was hatched when
roommates and BattleBots enthu-
siasts Ellen Fletcher ’07 and Betsy
Douglas ’07 heard about plans for
the College Republicans/EAC
debate. “I’m a College Republican,
and my best friend Betsy is the vice
president of the Environmental
Action Coalition, so naturally we
were pretty psyched about the
debate anyway,” said Fletcher.
“But when Betsy suggested our two
groups finish off the discussion
with a BattleBots war, I knew we
were on to something special.”

Both groups have been working
on their designs for the past few
weeks, and their warring robots
share a lot of characteristics simi-
lar to the organizations them-
selves. The EAC’s EarthBot is a
hybrid machine that runs on both
solar power and low-grade bio-
mass fuel. Two claws, made of
recycled plastics, shells, and held
together with hemp, are capable of
crushing a small car and protrude
from the body of the robot.

Constructed almost entirely out
of recycled aluminum cans and
baby diapers, the EarthBot trans-
forms discarded items that would
otherwise clog today’s landfills
into fully functional instruments
of destruction. “It’s an incredibly
efficient

While Davidson has certainly
caught BattleBots fever, some stu-
dents wonder what can be learned
about the current energy crisis
from a fight between two robots.
Fletcher says that students who do
not understand the inherent value

Douglas. “We

might explode, or
they both might.”

match just do not
get it. “You see,
it’s two robots,
and they’re in a
ring. One of them
might explode, or
they both might.”

and I think with
a little tweaking, we could surpass
the 100 mark.”

The College Republicans’
BattleBot runs on diesel fuel and
has to frequently refuel during
long matches. Ten gun turrets sit
atop the aptly named
HummerBot, which Fletcher
affectionately refers to as “H4.”

“We have attached two eight-
point deer antlers to the center of
the HummerBot, in order to
pierce the EarthBot’s aluminum
shell,” said Fletcher. “We’re going
to run through that recycled piece
of crap like a Panzer tank.”

EAC president
James Robbins ’06 agrees. “This
energy crisis and the careless
actions of the current administra-
tion must not be allowed to contin-
ue. But if they do continue, and we
can’t do anything about it, then
why not watch the robots fight
each other?”

Following the debate between
Eu and Phi halls, both sides and
any attendants will move to

Richard stadium to watch the

BattleBots match. The Physical
Plant has constructed an octagon
cage to be placed in the center of
the football field.

For almost four glorious years, a
young woman’s vision graced the
pages of The Davidsonian.

Her name was Laura Filosa, and
her social commentary was like the

glue that held this paper together.
Only this paper doesn’t have any
glue. It was more like the crease.
This vision was in the form of a
one-panel comic strip, which was

eloquently termed

A DOSA FILOSA, BY LAURA FILOSA

“A Dosa Filosa.”

Broaching topics
of all sorts, from
the academic to
the athletic to the
social, one panel of
only a few square
inches was able to
sum up the people
and events of
Davidson College
in a way that no
other medium
could.

Then, one day in
the spring of 2004,

from January 28, 2004

it was gone.
Readers scanned

the pages, frantically searching for
that which had made the entire
campus smile, think, and, yes,
sometimes cry.

But it was no more. The author,
artist, creator and genius had
graduated.

Barely half of the current stu-
dent body was around campus to
witness the unthinkable: the end
of “A Dosa Filosa.”

So, we at The Yowl feel it is our
duty, our responsibility, and our
privilege to bring to you some of
the best that “A Dosa Filosa” had
to offer.

We will run one of our favorite
comic strips every week from now
on, so that the brilliant dream that
was “A Dosa Filosa” will not die.
Her musings are still relevant, as
most classics are.

Sit back and enjoy Davidson,
because Dosa is ba-ack.

Best of the Worst

Last week, students were
asked via email to create and
bring posters to the men’s soccer
game against division rival
College of Charleston.

Here are some of the posters
that did not quite make it into
the winner’s circle.
