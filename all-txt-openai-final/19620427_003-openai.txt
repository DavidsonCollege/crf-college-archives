Four Teams Share Lead In I-F Softball Action

The ATO’s, Phi Delts, Kappa Sigs, and Pika’s lead in IMAC Double-Elimination Softball tournament after the first rounds of play. In action this week, the SAE’s clobbered the Sigma Nu’s 27-1, before losing to the Phi Delts 6-0, who received an outstanding performance from Randy Austin. The ATO's, led by Spud Stewart and Paul Duvall, subdued the Phi Gams 11-5 and went on to defeat the Sigma Chi’s, who had previously beaten the SPE’s 11-7. In the first game with the Phi Gams, Stewart hit a grand slam HR and gathered 7 RBI's to pace the ATO hitting attack. The Kappa Sigs, with a first-round bye, trounced the Pi Kapps 24-10 with a well-balanced attack and good pitching from Larry Compton. The Pi Kapps had previously won over the Independents 11-12. The Pikas whipped the KA’s 16-4 Monday and took the Beta’s 14-9, showing a good display of hitting. In other action this week, the Independents eliminated the SPE's from the tournament with an 8-7 victory Wednesday. Games in bracket to finish the second round of play began today (Friday). Volleyball play will resume after the softball tournament, if possible. All intramural play has to be completed by May 11 so the overall trophy can be awarded. At this point, the Phi Delts lead the overall race followed closely by the Beta’s, Phi Gams, and the Kappa Sigs. IMAC standings include Tag Football, wrestling, swimming, track, and basketball. Volleyball and handball have not been completed.

HIGHLIGHTS and SIDELIGHTS BY BILL PRIDGEN

DOLE’S BEEN BUSY RECRUITING TOO

Coach Bill Dole has the ability to make his scholarships go a long way. Next fall will see him bring to this campus some 18 boys with the 9½ full scholarships that he had to offer this year. Dole, under the handicap of having to recruit with less to offer in scholarships than other Southern Conference schools (next lowest gives any 18 full scholarships), has brought in a group of boys who range from Florida to Ohio. Dole seems pleased with the crop of footballers that he has attracted, saying that this group contains many outstanding individual performers. “We have two outstanding ends in Phil Hightower and John Hinsley,” he commented. “Hinsley, on top of being an excellent high school tackle, found time to make straight A’s during his school career. A couple of hen-sized 245-pound tackles will fill out the freshman line well. Dan Barefoot and Thomas Simmons are referred to by Dole as “two of the largest freshman ballplayers I’ve had.”

SPRING GAME LOOKED GOOD

Dole was pleased with the results of the spring game last Saturday. Many individual performances, particularly by the rising sophomores, showed him that he will have something to work with in trying to find replacements to fill the big gaps left in the squad by the graduating seniors. Dole expects much help in the end position from Steve Heckard, who really sparked in Saturday's game, Will Jackson, Sam Bowers, and Steve Davidson. He added that Billy Mills, a rising junior who hasn’t been out for the team before, will “be playing a lot of offense.” For the interior line, he mentioned Bruce Dalton, David Walker (on defense), Jay Rodgers, and Don Hall. Rodgers and Hall will add a lot of weight to the line. In the backfield, Dave Hendrix will be seeing action in the fullback position, and Gene Ferris, Pat Fisher, and Tommy Worrell will add much depth at the fullback slot. According to Dole, Worrell has “more potential because of speed and size than any back around here since Jim Thacker.” All these boys will be getting their share of varsity experience next year because of Dole’s 2½ platoon system. Dole hopes to field two teams which can go both ways, with one being offensive and the other defensive. In addition, he will field a third unit.

Whittlemen Ready For Davidson Relays

BY HANK ACKERMAN Davidsonian Sports Writer

More than eight teams will be participating in the fourth annual Davidson Relays which will be held at Richardson Field tomorrow. Field events will begin at 2 p.m. and the relays will start at 3 p.m. The ’Cat cindermen will be challenged by teams from Elon, Washington and Lee, Campbell College, Lenoir Rhyne, Fredrick College, Catawba College, and Presbyterian. Coach Heath Whittle said that he also expected Pembroke and East Carolina to be there but he had received no confirmation from them as of Wednesday afternoon. Whittle was optimistic about Davidson's chances in defending their three-year crown in the Relays. He said, “We've won it every year and I think we'll win it again Saturday.” W&L will be entering the largest team in the Relays, with 37 men. Whittle expects his biggest opposition from the Colonials, saying that they have had a “very good season.” The ’Cat tracksters hold the most records in the three-year history of the meet, but many of the records will have a good chance to be broken in this year’s strong field of runners. The main difference between a relay meet and a regular track meet is that the normal running events, like the 440 yd. dash and the mile run, have been taken out and all events are run in the form of relays. The field events remain the same. The relay events to be run tomorrow are the 440 relay, 880 relay, mile relay, two-mile relay, and the sprint relay. Whittle is looking for good performances tomorrow from Andy Boggs, Keith Frazer, and John Childes. Whittle will also be expecting a good showing from this year’s freshman team, who will be bringing much-needed depth to the varsity next spring. In commenting on the purpose of the Davidson Relays, Whittle stated, “There aren't too many relays around in which small schools can compete since there is such tough competition in relays like the Furman Relays. The purpose of the Davidson Relays is to provide a chance for small schools who don't subsidize track to compete on an equal basis.” On Tuesday, the thin clads took a trip to Blacksburg and were turned back by the Gobblers, 89 2/3 - 50 1/3. An interesting note on the meet is that the freshmen, who met VPI's freshmen the same afternoon, were defeated by a score almost identical to the varsity match, 89 1/3 - 50 2/3.BREAKS SCHOOL RECORD

John Sharp, running well for Davidson all season, broke the school record for the 440 yd dash with a posted time of 49.1 seconds flat. The old record was 49.5 seconds which was set by Al Elder in 1956. Another college record narrowly missed being broken at the same meet as John Childes passed the old record in the hop-step and jump, but accidentally stepped back when he completed the jump, and it was measured from where he stepped back.

Last Friday afternoon a small band of 'Cat thinclads soundly defeated the Richmond Spiders at Richmond by a score of 88-52. Bob Cordle was high scorer with a total of 20 points and sophomore Billy Mills was second with 11.

Spring game. They hit training session. Last Saturday afternoon the Davidson gridders ended spring practice with an intra-squad game which saw Kent Tucker's White team defeat Earl Cole's Red team, 19-14, at Richardson Field. The Whites scored on a 55-yard off-tackle run by Dave Lopp, a 45-yard pass and run from Tucker to Joe Jones, and a four-yard plunge by fullback Carl Hunt. The Reds scored on two touchdown passes by quarterback Cole. One was a 20-yard flip to sophomore Steve Heckard, the other a 15-yard toss to Rick Smith. Sophomore Barry Story kicked three extra points—two for the Reds, and one for the Whites. Dole looks for Story to strengthen the team next fall in the field goal department.

Dole, commenting on the 20-day spring practice, said that “the idea now is to develop the individual football player. We'll practice teamwork in the fall.” He stated that in the quarterback position Cole was “doing a good job” and that Tucker “looked real good” throughout spring practice. He expressed the hope that Alex Gibbs would quickly recover from a recent knee operation and so be able to help out at the quarterback and halfback slots. Benny Coxton, star quarterback at the beginning of last season, is out due to a nerve separation in his shoulder. He will have it checked in June to see whether the nerve is growing out and regenerating.

“There will be eleven or twelve sophomores playing a lot of football next year,” stated Dole. “They'll make a lot of mistakes, but we expect that of sophomores. They need that varsity game experience.” Asked to comment on Davidson's chances in the Southern Conference race next fall, Dole explained, “Well, it’s the same situation as always at Davidson. The other schools have more scholarships to offer. You know, you get more cream from a gallon of milk than you do from a quart. But as soon as our sophomores gain that experience we should have a pretty good football team.” The 'Cats open the season on September 15, against Catawba College in Charlotte.

Dole has recruited a “fine group” of 18 freshmen, the largest group of scholarship boys since 1953. “We've been lucky to lure boys here with only partial scholarships,” said Dole. He hopes to get some more scholarships next year since now he averages only 9½ full scholarships a year.

G-W AND MERCER ARE VICTIMS

'Cat Nine Snaps Slump, Meet Belmont Abbey Here

BY FORREST ROLES
Davidsonian Sports Writer

Tuesday afternoon, the 'Cats travel to Charleston, S. C., to try to extend their hot streak which began last Saturday when they defeated George Washington 1-0 and continued with a defeat of Mercer by the same score. The 'Cats entertained Belmont Abbey here this afternoon.

The return of Tom Harris to the 'Cat mound gave the team a big boost Saturday, with Harris allowing only two men to reach third base, and mastered the Generals on two hits. Harris has been sidelined with arm trouble all spring. Harris was helped out by a much improved defense. The infield was sharper than it had been all season, and took Harris out of possible trouble with two late inning double plays. Tom Hamilton continued his flawless play in center field.

The Davidson hitting was supplied by the middle of the lineup, second baseman Tom Tuttle and catcher Harry Cline, who both went three for five. Tuttle had a run-scoring double, and a wrong field triple, which drove in two runs among his hits; while Cline, who is in line for another all-conference berth, doubled twice, driving in two runs.

MERCER BOMBED

The 'Cats continued to get good pitching Wednesday as Tom Hamilton threw a three-hitter against Mercer. Cline continued his great hitting with four hits in five at bats, including a double and a triple. Hamilton gave up three hits and five walks, but worked his way out of trouble by striking out nine. The run scored off him was unearned, scoring on two errors in the outfield.

After the two games at the Citadel, the 'Cats journey to West Virginia University for a single game May 5, and then visit George Washington at Washington. West Virginia is the conference favorite, and has lost but one conference game. The Citadel has lost to George Washington 2-1 at Charleston.
