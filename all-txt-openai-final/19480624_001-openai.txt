SOFTBALL SEASON UNDERWAY

It is rather early in the softball competition to draw any conclusions as to who'll cop the "pennant," but here
are the league standings to date:

| Team | Won | Lost | Standing |
|--------|-----|------|----------|
| West | 2 | 0 | 1.000 |
| Town | 1 | 1 | .500 |
| Georgia| 1 | 1 | .500 |
| Watts | 0 | 2 | .000 |

West remains as the only undefeated team. Pitchers Bill Robertson and Gene Bingham form the battery that's apparently dealing mortal
blows to all the competition.

Joe Cooper seems to have found the right infield for his Georgia team since the trouncing by the Town team,
and used this combination to give Watts a defeat. Bill Johnson did Georgia's pitching. Georgia will feel the loss of
Johnson, who left Tuesday for an extended "G.I." vacation.

Occupants of the various dorms are urged to come out and support their teams.

This past year the athletic teams of Davidson proved that we are no longer a bunch of has-beens seeking a
string of moral victories; but this Saturday night the Y has decided to find out if the he-men who bumped
heads with the State Wolfpack and who blazed a trail of glory on the hardwood and on the courts really
have what it takes.

A two-mile grind around the track, or an hour's scrimmage under the tutelage of "Bloody Bill" Storey takes a lot
out of a fellow, or the veterans might even look back upon their basic training days as a nightmare of
physical exertion; but you "ain't" gone through anything yet until you try a few rounds of mountain style square dancing
to the music of that famous Cornelius String Ensemble. After a few swings around the walk in front of Chambers,
a quart of "Kickapoo Joy Juice" couldn't make you any dizzier, but this big event promises to be loads of
fun for everybody, and well worth all of the physical hardships that will be endured.

This is only one of the social events that will be sponsored by the Y this summer, and under the
able leadership of "Social" John Pritchard, arrangements have been made to take care of the acute shortage of women. Around
35 beauties from the Presbyterian Hospital will lay aside their duties as student nurses for the evening and make their
way to "The Hill" so that when the dance gets underway at 8:15 pm, there will be partners available for
everyone. Of course, if you have a special date in mind, bring her along.

HOPE TO SEE YOU THERE!
