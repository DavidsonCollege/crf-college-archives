After overcoming a strong sense of bewilderment, I wield a pen to respond to The Davidsonian’s most recent bovine. I
generally find their weekly drivel (I mean column) quite humorous. I have a little problem with their using “the power
of the pen” more as a weapon than a tool, but I like to laugh as much as the next
person, and if they can do that within even the broadest of journalistic boundaries, fine. The extended circulation of The
Davidsonian should reevaluate its guidelines offense in last week’s issue, however, which is more disconcerting. The image of the KKK
once again perversely graced the pages of The Davidsonian. The hooded figure appeared inexplicably in the “Bob the Carrot” strip
and was conspicuously labeled with Greek letters. Does the cartoonist feel that his truly relevant insights, though somewhat garbled by
a rather avant-garde style, display journalistic ineptitude?

The first, to no one’s surprise, occurred in last week’s MacLads column. The duo, already endeared to most Davidson circles,
referred to the recently selected Homecoming Queen in an apparent blatant, derogatory fashion. Because I, like many other readers of
The Davidsonian, didn’t attend the halftime festivities of the game, I was unaware that the members of Rusk unabashedly refer
to themselves as bovines. Evidently, this is the sole justification for the bovine/moo cow (just to make sure we all
know what one is) comment. Isn’t it rather hypocritical that “(t)he editors reserve the right not to print letters which
contain inside jokes, off-color slurs” (“Letters Policy,” The Davidsonian), but allow one, especially a rude one, in a Features column?

But it is not the writers whom this letter is intended to lambast. We happen to share a fraternal bond,
and it’s now difficult for me to be surprised by their zany antics. Aside from the fact that they occasionally
demonstrate themselves to possess the class of something less than...

I’ve been reading these Opinion pages for two years now. More often than not, they are filled with many types
of complaints about various aspects of life here at Davidson, be it classes, Patterson Court, athletics, or anything else we
can think of. Well, this letter is written to show one of the very good aspects of Davidson: the thoughts
and actions of the administration and, most importantly, the students.

I am currently a junior on medical leave as a result of a near-fatal automobile accident this past summer. Throughout
my recovery period, I have received an incredible amount of cards, letters, and phone calls from Davidson administration, faculty, staff,
and many, many students. The support shown helped me to overcome anyone’s worst nightmare.

Recently, I was fortunate enough to spend a weekend on campus. These were four of the most wonderful days of
my life. The show of love, concern, caring, and most importantly prayers, was overwhelming. Students I had never met before,
students I barely know, and those I know well, went out of their way to assist me and to show
me the best possible time I could have under the circumstances. New friendships were started and old ones rekindled. I
was so happy that I did not want to leave.

Though four months have passed since my accident, visionary problems keep my future unclear. Yet the love and support that
I have received from the Davidson community are very special. It has given me the motivation and determination to work
hard on completing my recovery. I seriously await the day that I will be able to return to school. Davidson
students have a lot to be proud of: our past accomplishments, our future prospects, and our concern for ourselves and
others, to name a few. Perhaps many of the complaints on these pages are legitimate. If we, the student body,
work together, maybe some of them will be solved. In my case, the gratitude I feel towards Davidson, and especially
the students, cannot be expressed in words. Davidson is a very special and unique place, with one of the finest
student bodies around.Thanks for everything, Davidson!

Joe Hoover is a junior from Hanover, Pennsylvania. The appropriateness of the comment. The many faculty, parents, alumni et al
who read the last issue were probably as bewildered as I when they read this and other “jokes.” Unaware of
their great humor, these readers surely questioned the discretion of the editors at least, or the values of the students,
however grossly misrepresented, at worst. It is the problem of discretion I wish to address. Apparently, the editors haven’t defined
their boundaries very well. Admittedly, I know little about the inner workings of journalism, but it seems their basic responsibility
is to make their publication presentable to its readers. Overtly offending anyone would therefore seem perfectly incongruous with this goal.
The fact that the editor consults regularly with a libel attorney regarding potentially damaging remarks (damaging to The Davidsonian, that
is) conveys a belligerent, “let’s see what we can get away with this week” attitude. It conjures up an image
of a child putting one foot in the street just to see if he’ll get slapped by mommy.

Use your voice

Two weeks ago the Davidsonian editorial asked the question, “Why does it seem like students have such a small voice
in the affairs of Davidson College?” Unlike most students, I don’t think the reason is that the administration doesn’t want
to listen to what we have to say; I think we are not saying very much for them to listen
to. The article cited the switch to semesters as an example of the lack of attention paid to student concerns
by saying, “Five years ago there were student-conceived straw polls, petitions and organized protest; this year there was nothing.” Whose
fault is that? Certainly not the administration’s.

Maybe this lack of expression on the part of the students is a result of the general apathy I’ve heard
complaints about. Maybe students are too busy writing Humes papers or preparing for quizzes to notice what’s going on around
them. I don’t know. But there is potential here; if the voice of students could help stop the Vietnam War,
it seems like it should be able to keep new dorms out of Belk parking lot. The administration has shown
it will pay attention to student opinions if they are given. Those students who have spoken up have met with
a lot of success. Last year’s divestment demonstrations are one example. Another is the attention to the mandatory laundry fee.
The fee has been mandatory for a long time, but now that Linda Tatsapaugh has started a petition and her
mother has written to the Davidsonian, the issue is receiving a lot of attention. The Davidsonian ran a front-page article
on it and the SGA formed a committee to look at the problem and possible alternatives.

There are plenty of issues that deserve student attention. If you care about what’s going on at your school, don’t
just complain to your roommate; do something! Circulate a petition, write a letter to the editors, talk to a decision-maker,
protest, start a crusade. The administration will listen to you and you can make a difference.
