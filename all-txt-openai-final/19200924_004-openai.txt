EDITORIAL

“The world is so full of a number of things, I’m sure we should all be as happy as kings.”

Patronize our Advertisers, for they make the paper possible.

The anti-prohibitionists are not the only ones who can claim a loss of their rights of personal liberty. The new
Absence Regulations place us in a similar plight.

The team leaves Friday night for one of the hardest games of the season. Don't fail to be at the
station to give them a rousing send-off. We owe it to them.

The Freshman Class has been duly honored by being given the seat of honor in the new chapel room, as
they now occupy the front rows of this great assembly.

The Varsity-Scrub game Saturday would indicate that the Wildcats are growing wilder every hour.

We are glad to welcome the band back on the job so early in the season. Their music is the
infallible way of rousing the old Davidson spirit. The men composing this organization should have the greatest recognition since their
efforts fill a long felt need on our campus.

It is hard for us to understand how a man can take a pennant or a light that does not
belong to him. Such an act should be put on the same plane as cheating.

THINK TWICE.

It is needless to say that the student body deeply regrets that reports have gone out to the effect that
there is hazing on the campus. The upperclassmen of this institution cannot help feeling that this is an injustice to
them, for we know absolutely that there is no organized or promiscuous hazing on the Hill. The Fresh Parade, a
custom for years at Davidson, was done away with as well as all other signs of rowdyism on the part
of the old men. In view of these things it is quite evident that the reports are entirely false.

As older brothers we would advise the new men that they consider thoughtfully just what they are writing home about
the hazing conditions here. Not a single one of them wants the outside world to cast a letter reflection on
the conduct of Davidson men. Writing home about having received one or two paddlings might create this very result. It
will never do any good to write happenings of this nature to outsiders, for they are so apt to misconstrue
the true meaning of things. If you have any cause of complaint, carry it direct to the Student Council. This
is the duty of that body of students, and they will investigate the matter thoroughly. Any other method of trying
to put down hazing will only cause confusion and false reports.

Then finally we would like to say that this hazing business, as far as Davidson is concerned, is a two-sided
affair anyway. What few paddlings are given here, are you sure that you do not deserve it? When a new
man tries to act pert or sarcastic with an old student, “jibing” to express it in campus vernacular, it is
entirely fitting that he should be reminded of his sphere of life here on the campus. Phrasing the old maxim
somewhat differently we would say “Spare the paddle and spoil the Freshman,” and for a new man guilty of the
above offense we know of no more effective remedy of keeping clearly before him the fact that he does not
enjoy the privileges of an upperclassman than by disregarding this principle. Therefore, it is quite plain this is the only
recourse left when a Freshman is guilty of “chronic jibing.”

In conclusion we repeat that the hazed student should ask himself the question whether the paddling was incurred because of
a contempt for college customs. If so, the less said concerning the matter the better. If not, before writing to
an outsider about it, think twice and even then don’t write. Take the sensible way out by carrying your complaint
to the Student Council, who will see that you get justice.

WHY NOT PLACE THIS IN THE NEW CONSTITUTION?

“No student shall play musical instruments after 8 p.m. This includes banjos, mandolins, ukuleles, bugles, any band instrument, victrolas or
any kind of music producing instrument.”

In 1916 approximately the above quotation was in the student government constitution. It was a very reasonable article and more
beneficial than some of us may think. It was beneficial not only from the standpoint that your neighbor next door
upstairs was relieved from hearing the sweet melodies that carry his mind from his studies to his girl back home—but
it meant that our young music enthusiasts were more able to lay down their pet “uke” or mandolin just because
they were honor bound to do so. In those days we were not disturbed about 10 o’clock by a few
“pep artists” that forgot about the other fellow’s privileges and derailed their trains of thought from the narrow channels that
must be followed in the pursuit of a scholastic education.

There were victrolas in the dormitories which added to the pleasure of quite a few and there was but one
case where reprimand was made. The question has been raised—Why do we have to listen to these sweet toned instruments
when the evening draws nigh and that impulse must be obeyed—to get up those tickets? Shall we tolerate this unnecessary
situation or amend our constitution in order to help each other?

South Carolina Begins New Year in Grand Style—Sol Metzger to Coach Football Squad.

Every phase of college life and college activity was ably set forth at the annual college night held in the
chapel last night when representatives of the various parts of campus life called urgently upon the students for support in
their branches in particular and all others in general. Coach Sol Metzger said that college spirit had been defined as
being an intangible thing, but that it seemed to him to be very tangible—Columbia State. Coach Sol Metzger is the
new coach that the University of South Carolina has secured and alumni and friends of the institution are counting on
his putting out the best football team that Carolina has had in years. Metzger is an authority on football and
is known all over America as a coach of no mean ability.

It may be that England can’t carry out her policy in Ireland because she is kept too busy carrying out
constables.

Many great inventions are accidental discoveries, and some home brew artist may yet discover a substitute for gasoline.

Why not make this proposed world court a tennis court? There would be an abundance of rackets.—Gastonia Gazette.

At a ball game between a South Carolina negro team and a visiting team of similar nationality, a negro preacher
was acting as umpire. The pitcher was somewhat wild and had allowed the bases to be filled. Another man came
to the bat and the nervous pitcher shot one over. “Ball one!” yelled the ump. The pitcher tried again. “Ball
two,” announced the ump. Another effort by the hurler. “Ball three!” greeted his efforts. The pitcher saw his predicament and
made one masterful effort to save the day. “Ball four and the man’s out,” announced the ump. “How come I’se
out?” inquired the enraged batter. “I’se repelled to put you out, nigger. Don’t you see dar’s nowhere else to put
you?” reasoned the ump.—Columbia (S. C.) State.

Photoplay Technique in a College Course.

Announcement is made that a course in the technique of the moving picture will be included in the curriculum of
Columbia University in New York City. The course is a part of the Department of English and was tried out
this summer with signal success—so go the reports received. “The course is still in an experimental state,” said Dr. Hunt,
who is in charge of this department. “What we are attempting is to determine for ourselves the value of the
motion picture as an aid to instruction in biography, history and whatever other studies lend themselves to picturization. The courses
in the writing and construction of the photoplay, given under Mr. Patterson, take up the motion picture from an entirely
different angle. “We are going to try to teach those students who show talent the actual technical points connected with
the writing of photoplays,” said Mr. Patterson. “We have our laboratories for this right in the motion picture theatres of
the city and in our own classrooms, where from time to time we show current films and attempt to analyze
them from all points that could be of interest to writers for the screen. This will include all of the
camera tricks and devices. The student must have a pretty fair knowledge of the limits and possibilities of the camera,
the use of the close-up, the fade-in and fade-out in the development of the story, adaptation of the story and
dramatization of setting.”—Photoplay Magazine.

“Do you mean to say that Peterkin didn’t show you over his new house?” “No; we never got any farther
than the cellar.”—Life.

DELTA PI KAPPA (Continued from page 1)

Technical and literary details of journalism are studied and the different forms and types of newspapers are analyzed and discussed
in detail. The fraternity will be very materially strengthened this year at Davidson by the new journalistic course known as
English Five. Dr. Erwin is the new associate Professor of English and with this course more Davidson men can get
literary training in the study and practice of journalism. The Davidsonian has received quite a bit of publicity in the
past years and has been commended by newspaper men of ability, and many compliments have been paid the publication. The
Delta Pi Kappa men not only wish to attain journalistic careers but to put forth every effort to improve and
develop the Davidson publications. To further the cause of journalism, prominent newspaper men will be brought to Davidson to lecture
on the subject under the Delta Pi Kappa auspices. Mr. J. C. Hutto, Editor of the Charlotte News, is expected
to be the speaker for next week. All men on the publications are urged to attend and all men interested
in journalism would do well to accept the invitation to hear Mr. Hutto. The old men returning this year are
J. M. Richards, M. R. Doubles, D. L. Mahood and W. P. Cumming.
