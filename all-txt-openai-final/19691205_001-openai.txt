**Holland Hopeful As Games Start**

Basketball Coach Terry Holland, at Open End the night before the Furman game, assured assembled students and fans "we'll be a great ball team.” Holland emphasized, however, that the boys would need to play several games to get working together right. Holland said that the Wildcats have a tough schedule this year, and that “Furman has the best team I've ever seen from Furman.” Richmond, William and Mary, South Carolina, VPI, and Saint John’s will be good competition, Holland said, and “George Washington's a definite contender. East Carolina has almost everybody back.”

Asked about the players, Holland said “Adrian’s defense has improved 200 per cent. He's got only 200 per cent to go.” He characterized DeMoisey as “a good shooter.” This year's freshman team, Holland observed, is “a better than average team for Davidson.” It is coached by Bo Brickles. Holland expressed no surprise at the sixth-in-the-nation rating Davidson has received from ‘Sports Illustrated.’ Nonetheless, he conceded, the team lost a great deal when Dave Moser and Wayne Huckel graduated.

In answer to other questions, Holland named Jan Kroll, Ron Stelzer, Lester Strong, and Steve Kirley as good substitutes from the bench. By the end of the season, he added, Lester Strong may be a starter. Asked about recruiting, Holland said that the “subsidy controversy” has had no effect on recruiting. He also recalled the basketball prospect from Cleveland, Ohio, who after visiting the campus, told former basketball coach Lefty Dreisell, “Your campus is beautiful, especially that beautiful little building right next to the girl’s dorm.” This particular rising young athlete is now playing basketball in college in Pennsylvania.

Holland has also kept in touch with Davidson basketball celebrities who have moved on to grander things. David Moser, he said, now sells auto insurance in Charlotte. Wayne Huckel has married Erica of the folk group “Erica, Eros, and Young,” which performed at the Union Coffeehouse last year. He is a law student at NYU. Rocky Crosswhite, famed leader of the “skin team” and former DAVIDSONIAN sports columnist, has written to Holland from Australia, which Crosswhite described as a “skin’s paradise.” He is currently scoring 26 points per game and is engaged to an Australian girl.

When a student asked him about professional basketball scouts coming to the campus, Holland said that some had written him concerning three of his starters, a reference to Kroll, Cook, and Maloy. “Do they want them as a unit?” someone asked. “If they want us to throw in a coach too,” cracked Holland, “They've got a deal.”

**EPC Resigns, Faculty Exams Vote**

By GRAY WILSON
Staff Writer

The Educational Policy Committee, in response to the blunt rejection of its proposals on area exams, has tendered its resignation to the faculty. In a memorandum released last week, the EPC stated its belief that it was not a representative committee of the faculty and was therefore not fulfilling its proper role. One intent of the resignation is to instruct the faculty in its consideration of policy. Reference is made specifically to the meeting on November 11, when the faculty dismissed the EPC proposals with little notice.

The committee asserts that “recommendations on very complex and vital issues, when based upon honest and open discussions, numerous individual contacts, extended periods of thought, informed experience, and conscientious effort, deserve thorough and open hearings rather than total rejection in summary fashion.”

The resignation was also promoted by a parliamentary reason. “If any deliberative body is to function properly through a committee structure, there must be mutual trust, confidence, and respect between that body and its committees. But when a deliberative body disposes of a committee recommendation without so much as a debate on the issues of that recommendation, and does so by a very large majority, it becomes obvious that the necessary trust, confidence, and respect are absent, and the vote is a vote of no confidence,” the EPC resignation stated.

The committee closed its statement with a pledge of support for the new committee. Professor James Fredericksen had some reservations about the resignation, but his doubts were of a technical nature. Richard Cowart is the dissenting member of the Committee, who feels that the reasons for the resignations of the faculty members apply to him as a student, “I was elected by the student senate to represent the student body. I believe I have represented the student body, and I feel no resentment over the faculty’s decision.”

**Day Care Center Gives Aid To Area Children, Students**

“Poorly done day care is worse than none at all,” said Mrs. Betty Cumming. Mrs. Cumming is a member of the North Mecklenburg Child Development Association, a community organization which, with the help of generous contributions from local industry, local families, and national foundations, has just completed a new children’s day care center on Getton Street. The new children’s center is designed to help the families with the most need. Mrs. Cumming noted that the coming of new industry to the area has given more job opportunities to mothers in low-income families, and that therefore, she said, “there has been a growing need for a day care center of this kind for many years.”

Tuition for the center will be on a sliding scale depending on the ability of the family to pay. Families who cannot afford to will not be required to. In addition to looking after the children while their parents are away, Mrs. Cumming said, the center hopes to be a service to the College community as well. The Learning Institute of North Carolina is subsidizing the salary of a director who will help young parents and child psychology students in the care and problems of young children. Davidson senior and Richardson Fellow George Penick is an intern working at the center, she said, and LINC is also subsidizing his salary.

**Vespers Planned**

Nine lessons will be “A Festival of Lessons and Carols” the form of worship for Davidson College's annual Christmas Vespers Sunday with music by the college's Male Chorus and Wind Ensemble. The program will begin at 7:30 in Love Auditorium, rather than the Davidson College Presbyterian Church as in the past. The nine lessons of the service tell the Christmas story beginning with creation and concluding with the birth of Jesus. Besides the group music, there will be special presentations during the program by Wilmer H. Welsh, organist, and Robert E. Jackson, trumpeter, both members of the college music department. Jackson will direct the Wind Ensemble and Donald B. Plott will lead the Male Chorus. College Chaplain Scott Woodmansee will be the presiding minister and sophomore Jack Scott will be the reader. The program will conclude with carols sung by the performers and the congregation.

**Computer Getting Optical Scanner**

An electronic optical scanner, a device which reads pencil marks on paper and converts the information into computer cards, will be added to Davidson College's data processing system this summer. The device, known as an OpScan 100 DC, manufactured by the Optical Scanning Corporation, will feed the college’s new NCR Century 100 System computer. Both will be installed by Aug. 1, 1970.

“The sky is the limit for the uses we can make of this equipment,” commented Dr. Jerry Roberts, head of Davidson's computer operations. “By cutting out much of our time-consuming key-punching operations, it will save us many hours with registration, class rolls, record keeping and other procedures.” The OpScan reads up to 2,400 documents per hour and is said to produce as many computer cards as 20 efficient key-punch operators.

Sample data sheets used by other colleges and universities around the country include records for the admissions office, student information forms, registration forms, school transcripts, grade reports, a wide variety of standardized tests, residence plans, employment records, and even a football scouting report.Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

DECEMBER 5, 1969

By DON HOYT

Tuesday afternoon, only a few hours after the drawing was held for the newly instituted draft lottery, an impromptu "Open End" took place with Colonel Virgil P. Foster, military science, speaking on the lottery and its effects upon Davidson ROTC. Many Davidson ROTC cadets who enrolled in the program—rather than risk being drafted upon graduation—now find that, because their lottery number is in the 200s or 300s, they would escape the draft anyway. Foster said that he wants to sound out opinion, as he wants student as well as the opinions of those at Army headquarters. “I want to see how many (cadets) change their mind or want to change their mind,” he explained. To determine what policy will be, Foster has sent a letter to Third Army Headquarters asking whether or not he “has the authority to disenroll MS III and MS IV students.” In the letter, Foster makes three points: 

1) Several cadets in the advanced program have met with him “to discuss and request possible disenrollment.”
2) Although cadets “believe they acted in good faith under the prior draft law by doing what they then considered the best for their future and their country,” now that a new system has been established, “they hold that on a one-time basis, they should be able to change their decision which caused them to sign a binding contract.”
3) The Davidson ROTC program is currently enrolling a number of students who received low numbers in the drawing; this enrollment will offset some of the disenrollments which would occur should the Army empower Foster to release cadets from their contracts.

At the Open End, Foster explained that he wanted to be fair to everybody. Those lottery numbers so low that they will certainly be drafted upon losing their student deferment can enter the ROTC program provided they pass the physicals and fulfill the other requirements. “I'm making it as painless as possible” to enroll in ROTC, he said. Foster emphasized the uniqueness of the present situation. He referred to the current law's major loophole, of which many college students may take advantage.

ROTC To Conform To New Draft Law

Monday night's drawing assigned priority numbers to all draftable men currently 19 and over. This, obviously, is a much larger group than that of next year, or the groups of following years, which will consist largely of 19-year-olds. A person with a borderline priority, say in the upper 100s, could choose to drop out of school and become eligible for the draft call of 1970, knowing that the quotas will be filled further down in the lottery numbers than usual. After having had 1-A status for a year, he would no longer be eligible.

Visitors Convene To Honor Little

About 50 members of Davidson College's Board of Visitors and their wives will be attending the group's annual meeting on campus Dec. 6, which will conclude with a 6:00 p.m. dinner in Charlotte honoring E. H. Little, a native of Mecklenburg County who became chairman of the board of Colgate-Palmolive Company and a benefactor of the college. The group does not have the power to take legislative action as do the Trustees of Davidson College. The Visitors will have a business meeting at 10:30 a.m. Saturday in the College Union, followed by a discussion of admissions policies and procedures by H. Edmunds White, director of admissions for Davidson. At 2:30 p.m. in the Fine Arts Center College President Samuel R. Spencer Jr., will explain the reports of the five special advisory commissions which were released last month. The meeting will conclude with a dinner at the North Carolina National Bank Building honoring E. H. Little, whose persistence and ability took him from a farm in Mecklenburg County to the chairmanship of the Colgate-Palmolive Company. He was responsible for establishing the firm's foreign sales operations, which now account for half of the total sales volume. His contributions and those of his wife, the late Suzanne Trezevant Little, helped Davidson build the Dana Science Building and the Cunningham Fine Arts Center. A dormitory on the campus is named in his honor.

Student-Run Program Seeks Black Applicants

The office of Admissions and Financial Aid has initiated a largely student-controlled program to encourage black students to apply to Davidson. “It has been mostly an individual thing,” said sophomore Bobby Allen, who was appointed to coordinate the effort two months ago by H. Edmunds White, director of admissions and financial aid. Last spring the admissions office sent letters to the schools throughout the Southeast requesting the names of students who would be qualified for admission to Davidson. In the summer, Calvin Murphy followed up some of the leads provided by the schools. Of the Negroes who have applied thus far this year, six of them were contacted by Murphy on his summer tour. Lester Strong and Reggie Kennedy have also been active in contacting prospects. “We expect a lot more than that because we have not heard from many of those to whom we sent applications,” Allen said. Allen said that the newly formed Black Students Coalition (BSC) was planning a gathering of prospective students January 6-9. “The purpose is primarily for them to see what it is like to be here,” he said. The itinerary for the visit includes classes, visits with faculty, admissions interviews, and Davidson's Thursday night basketball game. Allen said there were no unusual early decision applicants under the plan according to assistant director of admissions and financial aid, Jon W. Regen. With many schools offering attractive recruiting inducements, it is advantageous for blacks to weigh the alternatives, Allen said. In addition, Davidson must overcome the “Yale-Harvard syndrome” and heavily financed efforts of other large universities.

Tufts Will Set Up Alternate Majors

Individual Study Plans, beginning this year, will be available to undergraduates at Tufts University as an alternative to the conventional major. Students will be able to create their own “major” or Plan of Study in areas such as black culture and urban studies until now not possible for Tufts’ 3300 undergraduates. Students are now able to choose the area in which they wish to concentrate and create a major of their own devising not offered by the regular academic departments. Explains one administrator, “What it does, in essence, is allow any undergraduate to select his own course of study.” The student may, for example, major in urban studies or black studies or space programming, or another field of his own choice. With his advisers, he picks a group of courses or seminars which together provide the tools and knowledge necessary for understanding in his chosen field of study. “Two points are important about this approach. First, it differs from what is happening at other schools, where a student must be enrolled in a separate experimental college to choose his own course of study. Second, because of the Experimental College here, he can, with others if necessary, establish new courses at Tufts which will fit into his area of study. This approach makes it possible for a student to major in an area of current interest without concern for freezing this area into the curriculum. At the same time, it continues to demand concentration, rather than abandoning the standards that give the bachelor’s degree meaning.” Outside agencies will also serve the Plans of Study program. For example, if a student wishes to concentrate in “The Human Life Cycle,” he can enlist as a volunteer worker in agencies already set up to deal with humans in various stages of the life cycle from infancy (Children’s Hospital) to old age (the City Infirmary, which provides terminal care for the elderly). Each student working within a Plan of Study consults with the Committee and a designated faculty advisor, particularly concerning questions of academic honors and the satisfaction of degree requirements. The traditional majors will be maintained, according to the Faculty Long-Range Planning Committee, although “students will be encouraged to develop these individual Plans of Study.”
