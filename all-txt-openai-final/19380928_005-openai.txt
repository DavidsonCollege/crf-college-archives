If you want the Pen that ranks No.1 in schools and colleges—that will help you more than any other pen
you can carry—go to any counter today and see and try this in shimmery circlets of Pearl and Jet, exclusive
and original. The Parker Vacumatic won't cramp your style by running dry unexpectedly in classes. For held to the light
it shows how much ink you have to spare—shows when to refill. A quick fill requires filling only 3 or
4 times from one term to the next, due to its copious ink supply. Its Scratch-proof point of Platinum and
14-K Gold is tipped with Osmiridium, twice as hard as ordinary iridium. Go and ask for it by name—Parker Vacumatic.
The smart ARROW clip identifies the genuine. The Parker Pen Co., Janesville, Wisconsin.

Modernizations

Colin Shaw Smith went to his home in Mt. Olive. Dr. and Mrs. McLean came down for the game. Many
improvements which greatly increase the beauty and efficiency of the college buildings have been made to the campus during the
summer, according to Mr. F. L. Jackson, treasurer of the college.

In line with making living conditions better, hot and cold water has been put in all rooms of West dormitory,
and showers have been installed on the third and fourth floors of both East and West. The stadium has been
put into shape, and all its seats have been treated against the weather. The fraternity houses were ready for rush
week with the woodwork painted. The laundry was also painted, and additional equipment for ironing and folding shirts installed.

New steam pipes to carry the condensation from Chambers back to the central heating plant have been put in. The
walls of the coaches’ offices in the gymnasium were painted, and additional tables and chairs were added to the furnishings.
The front room in the gym has been painted and furnished as a reading room. Several of the college-owned residences
have been painted. The president's home is among these.
