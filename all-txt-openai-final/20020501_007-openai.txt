The team faced competition from all over the eastern US. This year, the team was determined to show that even
without hired coaches or the amount of funding that other schools receive, they could succeed. The novice women and the
novice men both came in last in their initial heats, but, because of the way SIRA is organized, the women
automatically progressed to C-finals and the men to C-semifinals. In C-semifinals on Saturday, the novice men rallied and won their
heat by three seconds, qualifying for C-finals. In the C-final, the novice men finished a close third. Chris Hallett remarked,
“Previous regattas felt less like races and more like frustrating, intense practices. This weekend it all came together. Even though
we didn’t exactly walk the whole field, when we finished we had that satisfaction that only comes at the end
of a race, and that was rewarding.”

The novice men’s boat is comprised of freshmen Emily Upchurch, Hallett, Mark Grotjohn, Sean Wentworth, and Jeremy Kenison. The novice
women’s C-final was on Sunday morning and they came in fifth. The women felt their race showed a strong improvement
since the beginning of the season. Kim Newton commented, “Although we didn’t win our heat, actually we came in last,
the competition was tough and we stuck in there.” The novice women’s boat is composed of freshmen Kim Newton, Katie
Bennett, Emily Wilson, Claire Doran, and Virginia Gregory (cox). For the first time, Davidson also fielded a novice women’s lightweight
boat. They came in fifth out of six in their finals-only event and the women felt very positive about their
race. Andy Griffith is joined by freshmen Emily Dolezal.

At first, the results were a little disappointing. Andy Griffith commented, “We should have easily been in position to fight
for a medal in the finals. But at around the 1250 mark, everyone passed us.” The varsity women were thrilled
by making finals for the first time at SIRA. After coming in third in their heat only fourteen seconds behind
first, they proceeded to finals with a great deal of enthusiasm. In finals, the women finished sixth. Rower Diana Chemotti
said, “We all felt great and gave it everything we had. It feels like we came such a long way
this season from having a goal of beating one boat at our first regatta to being in the pack of
boats the entire race and finishing within fifteen strokes of the first place boat.” Chemotti was joined by Monica Siegenthaler,
Kate Giguere, Rebecca Stickel, and Jamie Causey.

After easily coming in second in their heat, the varsity men proceeded to a competitive A/B semifinal. Although their fourth
place finish meant that they were out of medal contention, the men progressed to petite finals on Sunday. As rower
Ryan Auster remarked, “We went out on Sunday morning determined to prove to ourselves and every other crew at the
regatta that not only were we competitive but that we deserved to be in the top finals.” The men hung
with a surprisingly powerful boat from Alabama but were still down until the last 500 meters when they stepped it
up to walk them and finish first by 1.3 seconds. The varsity men’s four is made up of Auster, Luke
O'Hara, Ryan Carvalho, John Franklin, and coxswain Andrea Lytle.

This season, the Davidson...Crew added nine rowers, changed coaches, purchased two new boats, competed in four sprint regattas, and won
two medals. As Giguere commented, “Our results are telling—Davidson Crew is competitive. We are capable of more than simply holding
our own with some of the best crews in the nation; we can beat them.”

**Volleyball’s Darwin resigns after two years at helm**

By Caroline Hauser, Sports Editor

After two seasons with the Wildcats, one of which resulted in an NCAA tournament bid, head volleyball coach Tami Darwin
is calling it quits. Athletic Director Jim Murphy confirmed that Darwin resigned “to pursue other opportunities.” In 2000, Darwin led
Davidson to a Southern Conference championship and the school’s second NCAA appearance. Her follow-up 2001 campaign ended 15-17 overall and
11-9 in the Southern Conference. Last month, Darwin announced the hiring of former Penn State player and student coach Steven
Aird as an assistant coach. Of her career choice, Darwin simply said, “I am grateful for the experience I had
here at Davidson and wish the program continued success in the future. Davidson will always have a special place in
my heart.”
