WHAT’S YOUR HEADING?
AIR FORCE NAVIGATORS are always heading in the right direction...toward sound, prosperous futures and experiencing a great way of life.

PUT YOURSELF ON THE RIGHT HEADING by enrolling in Air Force ROTC. With four, three, and two-year scholarships, Air Force
ROTC can help you through college and into flying while you're still in college. And as soon as you qualify,
you'll be on your way to Air Force navigator training in modern jet aircraft. That's the first step in setting
your heading for an Air Force commission and earning the coveted Air Force navigator wings.

Find out today about Air Force ROTC, about the generous scholarships available, and about the great opportunities open to Air
Force navigators. DO IT NOW. Call or write:
