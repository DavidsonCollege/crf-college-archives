Alexander was chosen Valedictorian of the Phi Society and V. P. D. Sparrow, Respondent. The president also appointed a committee who, after conferring with members of the faculty, will make nominations for the alumni speaker.

The preparation for the Blue Ridge cottage is progressing as well as could be expected. Before Christmas, there was subscribed in total $399.00. Of this amount, there was collected, by January 18, $144, all of which was paid by the students alone. An effort will be made to collect the remainder by the first of February. Dr. Weatherhead writes that if the amount subscribed can be paid by the first of the month, work will begin on the cottage immediately. He promises to do his “dead level-best” to get the cottage ready for use by summer, but if not, there will be another effort.we the members, at the disposal of the Davidson men.

1914 FOOTBALL STATISTICS.

The special features of the entertainment which followed were the splendid funambulistic feats and the danse à la boue.

BIBLE STUDY ATTENDANCE.

The attendance at the Bible Study classes to date has been posted in the Library and attracts much interest. Two classes still show an average attendance to date of 100 percent: those of A. S. Scarborough and P. D. Patrick. Many others follow close behind. As the Bible classes will close at the end of January, every class will try to keep its record immaculate the next two Sundays. In February, the Mission Study classes will start, and it is hoped that their success will be even better than that of the Bible Study.

Four hundred and fifty colleges, 6,990 secondary schools, and 1,500 teams not connected with educational institutions played intercollegiate football; 34,000 games were played, and 152,000 players participated in some form of football; 7,292,000 persons attended the games, the record attendance being 70,000 at the Harvard-Yale game. The largest sum of scores piled up by any one team was made by Rolla 569 to its opponents’ 10. Other leading elevens showed as follows: Washington and Jefferson, 369; Virginia, 752; Dartmouth, 319; Washington and Lee, 313. Georgia Tech, Washington and Jefferson, St. Louis, Notre Dame, and Washington and Lee each scored more than 100 points in one game. Nineteen touchdowns were made during the season by running back kick-offs.

“Doc” Guthrie (14a) writes: “Pat, my boy, what’s the trouble? Have you fellows run out of news, suspended operations, or was there an earthquake? There has been no copy of The Davidsonian this way since stars made her debut.” “Doc.” Here you are.
