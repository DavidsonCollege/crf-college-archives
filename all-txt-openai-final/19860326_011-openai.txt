**Duke to take unpredictable NCAA tourney**

By EDWIN PAGE

Every October when I watch the World Series, I am reassured that it is certainly the most perfect manifestation of sports in the world, and every March I feel the same way about the NCAA tournament. I am not sure that I will ever be able to decide between the two, but now, in March, the case for the NCAA’s seems very strong.

Periodically, I have reservations about the validity of the 64-team field, but when the first round of play begins, those reservations start to fade. It almost makes you feel like the selection committee knows their business when perennial giants like Notre Dame and Indiana get sent packing by underdogs like Arkansas-Little Rock and Cleveland State. Admittedly, there are lots of predictable drubbings like Syracuse’s destruction of Brown 101-52, but as long as there are one or two Cleveland States around, the matchups like Syracuse-Brown don’t seem as ridiculous.

Duke had its most difficult game of the tournament so far against lowly Mississippi Valley State, who, playing with a 6’3” center, gave the Blue Devils all they could handle before foul trouble and fatigue did them in. The first round weeds out the chaff and helps the real contenders to shape up, and in the second round, the fun really begins.

Of the 16 games on tap in the second round this year, only eight of them bothered to conform to the script. Navy ambushed Syracuse in the extremely hostile confines of the Carrier Dome behind a superior effort from 6’11” center David Robinson who scored 35 points and added 11 rebounds and 7 blocks while causing the Orangemen’s front line to become hopelessly mired in foul trouble. DePaul, famous in the past for staging early exits from the tournament, helped erase memories of a disappointing 16-12 season by advancing to the final 16 at the expense of Oklahoma.

Scott Skiles and Michigan State proved how good Pat Ewing really is when they nipped Hoya Paranoia in the bud 80-68. I wouldn’t want my son to grow up like Skiles (who will spend 15 days in jail soon), just play like him. You could see Skiles’ love for the game as clearly as the blood stain on his sock. Rarely have I seen a player with the combination of talent and raw guts that are present in Skiles. If he can get his life straightened out he might even help make pro basketball interesting.

St. John’s, Michigan, Memphis State and Illinois were also unexpectedly dispatched in the second round. Cleveland St. did it again, downing St. Joseph's and Ark.-Little Rock came within a missed free throw of beating N.C. State before succumbing to the Wolfpack.

When all the bodies had been counted, some startling facts emerged. The Big East, which last year seemed on the verge of dominating the college game completely, was gone. The Pac-10 continued in its fine NCAA tradition of late, going home winless once again. The AP pollsters provided another argument for college football playoffs when 11 of these authorities’ Top 20 teams got to resume their studies with only one weekend of interruption.

The third round went a little more according to form, but not by much as Navy barely stayed afloat against Cleveland St., and powerful Kansas needed an extra 5 minutes and 15 seconds (the 15 seconds came courtesy of a malfunction in the clock) before they could get by Michigan State. The Southeastern Conference provided the only upsets, courtesy of LSU and Auburn, as the final eight rounded into shape. Duke and Louisville earned their tickets to Dallas without too much difficulty, and Kansas pulled away from N.C. State in the final minutes to set up a showdown with Duke. Kentucky, on the other hand, had to cancel their reservations as LSU won for the first time in four meetings with the Wildcats this season.

The Bayou Bengals have overcome a lot of hardship this season in earning their shot at the national title. Highly touted at the outset of the year, they won 14 straight before losing in six of their next eight outings. LSU was forced to deal with the disappearance of Tito Horford before the season, the academic ineligibility of starter Nikita Wilson, a disastrous team-wide epidemic of chicken pox in January and a reputation as tournament chokers, and yet here they are, the eleventh seeded team in their region, having upset four quality opponents that include the numbers one, two, and three seeds in the Southeast regional.

The only specter on the tournament this year is the blatant money grabbing being practiced by the NCAA when it allows teams to play at or very close to home. It seems that the aim of the tournament directors is to maximize profits at the expense of fair competition. Placing teams in hometown arenas assures that the game will sell out. It also swings the scales in favor of the home team. Sure, Syracuse and Georgia Tech lost on familiar territory, but that doesn't mean Kansas and Duke weren't helped by hometown crowds. As much as I admire the toughness of the LSU team, I have to wonder if they could have squeaked by Purdue and Memphis St. had they played outside the Deaf Dome at Baton Rouge. It is sad that such a great event should be marred by this type of speculation.

Now for the hard part, predictions. Duke is on a big roll and Kansas has had to scratch and claw for its last two wins, so as much as I hate to say it, Duke will pull away from the Jayhawks and win by eight.LSU is hot, but so is Louisville. On pure talent, I would pick Louisville, but LSU is this year’s Cinderella. They will advance to the finals in a tight game. Duke, however, will not be denied, and an ACC team will once again wear the national crown.

Men's tennis beat James Madison, West Virginia
By SUSAN WILKINS

Junior Hayes Dallas looked at the miss-hit ball and muttered “airball.” “Airball” is not a term usually used at a tennis match. It never means anything good when it is used in basketball. However, at Davidson, the use of this word is a good sign. It typifies the relaxed attitude of Dallas, the second singles player for Davidson’s men’s tennis team. Dallas leads the Cats in victories with a 9-4 singles record and is playing so well that he makes his opponents look bad.

The entire team has made their opponents, no matter how good, look bad this past week. After two tough wins two weeks ago over James Madison University and West Virginia (Davidson won both 5-4) and one easy victory over Elon (7-2), Davidson settled down and began to make tennis look easy. The Cats started off this past week with a convincing 9-0 victory over Amherst. They then traveled to Chapel Hill to play an always strong UNC team. The Wildcats lost 7-2. The only victories at UNC came at the number three singles spot and the number three doubles spot. Sophomore Bill Young won his singles match in three sets (4-6, 6-3, 6-3) and senior Craig Hall teamed with junior Michael Meyer to win 6-3, 6-1 at doubles. Meyer also played well at number five singles, though losing 4-6, 6-4, 1-6.

Friday, the men’s team was back home. Cold, wet weather forced the Cats to play indoors against Wooster. Wooster’s doubles teams played hard and pushed all doubles matches into three sets before losing to the Wildcats and letting them post another 9-0 victory. Davidson played Harvard’s B-team on Saturday. Injuries that hurt the team earlier in the season are healing, and the Cats looked tough against Harvard, winning 7-2. The only Davidson losses against Harvard came in number one singles and number one doubles. Sophomore Jim Thompson (Davidson’s number one player) played exciting tennis, especially in the third set when he held off three match points. In the tiebreaker, Harvard’s Hank Panichabitr's forehand overpowered Thompson, and he won the match for Harvard 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-1 in the tiebreaker). Freshman Sebastian Koch secured the victory for Davidson when he won at number six singles. Koch looked like he had trouble concentrating in the second set but came back in the third set and devastated his opponent, 6-3, 6-7, 6-0.

The men's tennis team's strength is its depth, according to coach Jeff Frank. Among the top three players, there is no one dominant player. The same is true for the fourth, fifth, and sixth seeds. The Cats usually win enough singles matches to win, which is fortunate. The Wildcats’ doubles are not as strong as their singles. Davidson does not have an aggressive serve-and-volley doubles player; their doubles strength lies in aggressive returns and the strong net play of Dallas and junior Trip Caldwell. Davidson will play one home match before Easter, hosting Ohio University Thursday at 2 pm. After Easter, they're at home against Evansville, South Carolina, and Edinboro on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. All matches start at 2 pm.

The women’s tennis team now possesses a 2-4 record, which is right on schedule according to coach Caroline Brown. The team is used to getting off to 6-0 or 9-0 starts, but Brown has shifted philosophies as far as scheduling goes. She put harder teams like Duke, NC State, and Rutgers at the beginning of the schedule instead of the middle or end as in previous seasons. Her reasoning is to challenge her players early on and improve them in preparation for Division III schools and the National Championship. Therefore, the 2-4 record at this point is right on schedule.

Last Saturday, Mar. 15, the Lady Cats fell to Peace Junior College, one of the nation’s top 10 junior college teams, 7-2. Junior Debbie Podolin was a winner in singles play, and the doubles team of senior captain Lolly Johnson and sophomore Emily Berman got the second win. Aside from the fact that Peace is a strong team, Brown schedules them for recruiting purposes, hoping to win some Peace women over to the Davidson program after they graduate.

The following day, Davidson traveled to Eastern Carolina for a decisive 9-0 victory. Brown described the win as ‘an excellent performance overall.” On Wednesday, Davidson lost 7-2 to Rutgers, a large Division I university out of New Jersey. Despite the defeat, Davidson played some of its best tennis this season. Number one singles Amy McNelis, a sophomore, won her match, as did Podolin at number four singles. Unfortunately, the team was not able to pick up another singles point and was thus faced with the task of winning all three doubles matches, no easy feat. They lost all three but performed very well with the number one team of McNelis and freshman Marion Stone, and the number three team of Podolin and freshman Martha Johnson, both splitting sets before losing. Brown is still experimenting with combinations for the number two doubles team since freshman Alice Stubbs is still sick.

Now that Davidson has been whipped into shape by strong Division I teams, the team is ready to face some Division III teams. On Tuesday, Mar. 25, the women will face Hope College at Davidson. On Wednesday, they travel to Clinton, S.C. to meet Presbyterian College, and on Friday afternoon, they host Ohio University. This is the week for Brown’s new philosophy to be put to the test.
