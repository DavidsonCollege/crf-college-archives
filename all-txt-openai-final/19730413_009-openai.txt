Sidelines don't support subsidized football. The faculty and administration don’t support subsidized football, so I guess it’s pretty obvious that it's the trustees and alumni who are supporting it and keeping it here.” — Dave Fagg, Head Football Coach.

From the opinions aired at last Tuesday's Open End, it would appear that Dave Fagg summed up the situation pretty succinctly. The trustees have kept subsidized football at Davidson in the face of continuing criticism, even though they acknowledged as early as 1967 that the football program was costing too much money. Running a non-subsidized football program, it was pointed out, would save the college only $15,000 at most, assuming that all football scholarships were given out to other students and that Davidson competed in a non-subsidized conference.

The one argument for subsidized football that was not contested was that if Davidson drops subsidized football, then Davidson would probably be dropped from the Southern Conference. The Southern Conference enjoys the privilege of a major college conference ranking. The primary sport of major college conferences is football. Although there is no stated rule, if Davidson did withdraw its subsidized football program, the conference would probably have no other choice but to drop Davidson.

What does the Southern Conference offer Davidson and what would it mean to Davidson if we pulled out or were dropped by the other teams in the conference? The Southern Conference is the only major college conference in the nation which has no academic standards or scholarship limitations. The Southern Conference also has no revenue-sharing system among its members to help the schools, such as Davidson, who do not have the financial support that most of the teams enjoy through state aid.

There is one advantage to being a member of the Southern Conference, however. The winner of the Southern Conference Basketball Tournament automatically receives a bid to the NCAA basketball playoffs, which gives that school a substantial deal of money. Thus, it can be said that the trustees are maintaining the football program at least partially for the benefit of the basketball team. It would follow then that the basketball team would have to be responsible for the cost of the football team.

Three years ago this would have been feasible for the simple reason that Davidson was the logical favorite to win the Southern Conference Tournament. In light of the progress made by the other teams in the conference over the past years, however, such reasoning is no longer logical. Last year the football team lost approximately $160,000 and the basketball team $140,000. This year both teams have lost about the same amounts of money. Assuming that football loses another $150,000 next year, a total deficit of $450,000 will have been incurred. If the basketball team were to win the Southern Conference Tournament next year and go on to the NCAA playoffs, there is no way the team could cover those losses after paying their own expenses.

If the trustees are supporting football for the sake of the football team, then perhaps they should take another look. By maintaining a subsidized football program so that the basketball team has a better chance to gain a playoff berth, they are costing the school more money than it can afford. The trustee's committee on athletics is meeting later this year. They will be faced with the issue of subsidized football. Unless they feel the basketball team can play well enough to receive an independent bid to the NCAA playoffs, the football subsidy will probably be retained with its proposed 20 percent cut. In short, there is no logical reason for Davidson to remain in the Southern Conference and when the trustee's committee on athletics meets later this year, maybe they should keep that in mind.

Cat Netters Smash Furman. Duke, State Next On Schedule
By GORDON WIDENHOUSE
Sports Editor

In probably the biggest week of the season, the Davidson tennis team smashed Furman Tuesday by a score of 6-3. TheNetters continue their treacherous path today as they face a strong Blue Devil corps from Duke, while the N.C. State Wolfpack await a Saturday match-up. With Captain David Weaver taking the number one singles contest down to a tiebreaker in the third and deciding set, the torrid Cats copped their 12th victory in a row and their sixteenth win against one lone setback.

“I thought Weaver played real well,” said Head Coach Jeff Frank. “He started real strong and then sort of lost his concentration in the second set. But he put it together in the third set under real pressure to win that tiebreaker. I thought he came through in fine form."

Weaver copped the first set from Furman’s Dave Holley by a score of 6-1, but the Paladin ace came back to turn the tables on Weaver by an identical margin in the following set. Weaver then put it all away in the third set. He led 4-2 and looked as if the match was over. But Holley rallied to force the match into the final point. Weaver then showed his pressure abilities, taking the set 7-4.

Kevin Menton defeated Dudley Reynolds in the second seeding 6-4, 6-3. This, combined with Bill Allen's third position win over Robert Huckfield by a score of 6-1, 6-0, put the Cats on top with a commanding lead. Hy Lankenau copped the win in the number five position to put the Cats within one team point of victory going into the doubles action.

“Menton and Allen also played real well,” praised Frank. “Lankenau had been having some off matches recently. He sure looked like he has regained his confidence and form. We are looking good for the conference tournament.”

Weaver had a hand in putting the match away for the visiting Wildcats as he teamed with Maarten Ruys to win the top doubles position 6-2, 6-1. Gary Bressler and Jim Dorsett gave the Cats the final margin with a 6-2, 6-4 triumph in the third seed of the doubles competition. Perhaps the worries that Frank has had concerning this doubles spot may be coming close to an end.

“Overall I would have to say that I am pleased with the win,” Frank said. “It was a good win away from home against one of our strongest contenders in the conference. That has to be a big plus in our favor.”

The conditions were not the best in the world for tennis by any means. “It was cold and very windy,” explained Frank. “We almost did not play. I thought our guys did very well considering all this.”

Furman has beaten Appalachian already this season by the margin of 6-3. This should be a good indicator for the Wildcats as they approach the clash with the Mountaineers. If the netters can get by the Big Blue, the path would be open for a great seasonal record.
