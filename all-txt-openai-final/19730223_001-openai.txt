**Financial Aid Affected By Budget Cuts**
By TOM BRUCE
Associate Editor

President Richard Nixon has not recommended funding for several educational programs, new and old, that bear on the life of
Davidson College. Although the immediate effects of the President's cuts could not be calculated, it was feared that the college
might lose certain grants for new dormitories, as well as some federal financial aid for students.

“The Higher Education Facilities Act has been frozen,” explained College President Samuel R. Spencer Jr., “and no new funds will
be available if President Nixon's recommendations are approved. We also stand to lose the funding of Educational Opportunity Grants as
well as the National Direct Student Loans, as they are in their present form,” Spencer stated.

Nixon's requests will not affect the college's endowed scholarships, but it will affect students whose federal loans and grants have
already been granted and maintained. The telling effect will be on those who are applying currently for admission in the
fall, since the President's requests will go into effect in the fiscal year that begins July 1, 1973. The money
furnished by the Work-study programs will not be affected since the President recommended that this program be funded at the
present level.

The President's action has prompted criticism and backlash from some educational lobbies in Washington. The American Council on Education, a
rather strong lobby, will work through its Commission on Federal Relations to effect a reversal or at least a compromise.
The commission will work to place highest priority on increases totaling $454 million over the President's budget for higher education
programs of HEW’s Education Division for fiscal year 1974. The commission has proposed $286 million for direct student loans, whereas
the Administration Budget calls for only $5 million.

The administration is trying to counter the loss of the Educational Opportunity Grants by expanding the Basic Opportunity Grants. In
the long run, the object of financial aid will shift from middle-income families to lower-income families. Some Davidson students who
now receive these grants would then probably not qualify because a greater degree of need would have to be demonstrated.
The effect will be that more people will qualify for federal aid.

**Trustees To Consider Budget During Special Session Today**
By BRUCE MALOY
Managing Editor

The Davidson College Board of Trustees is breaking tradition with today's meeting to approve the budget for 1973-74. In recent
years the trustees have met only in October and May. Vice President for Finance and Development C. David Cornell explained
that “the budget has never been ready for approval in October and May was too late.”

A copy of the tentative budget was sent to the trustees on Feb. 14 so that they would have a
full week to examine the budget instead of the single night which they have had in the past. The Finance
and Management Committee met with Cornell and Business Manager Robert Currie yesterday to discuss the budget and to prepare the
presentation which will be given to the full membership of the board later today. At that time, individual trustees will
have an opportunity to question the budget and move that it be changed.

Cornell called the Finance and Management Committee “one of the finest I've ever worked with.” Charles F. Myers Jr., chairman
of the committee, is chairman of the board of Burlington Industries. Vice Chairman Walter L. Lingle is the vice president
of Proctor and Gamble; Julien L. McCall is president of the National City Bank in Cleveland; and Frank Matthews is
general manager of Belk-Matthews in Gastonia, N.C. “I'm glad we've got men with such experience,” added Cornell.

The budget, Buildings and Grounds Committee, which has prepared this tentative budget, held an open meeting earlier this year to
hear requests from students and faculty for special attention to certain areas of the budget. According to Cornell, “The committee
took into account every priority that was brought before it at the open meeting.” He pointed out that once the
budget has been approved, it will be changed only for extraordinary reasons.

There are several other matters...

**Davidson To Accept 51 Men, 13 Women On Early Decision**

Fifty-one men and 13 women have been accepted on ‘early decision’ by Davidson College for admission in the fall of
1973. This is the largest group accepted on early decision by the college, and the first to include women since
Davidson only became coeducational a year ago. On the early decision plan, students must complete applications by Nov. 1 and
indicate that they have not applied to any other colleges and that they will attend Davidson if accepted. Similar plans
are in effect...at many other educational institutions. "Early decision applicants do not need exceptional credentials," said H. Edmunds White, director
of admissions. "We are looking for qualified students who are certain they want to attend Davidson. In addition, there are
a number of prospective students whom we did not accept for early decision but who will be reconsidered after the
regular admissions deadline of March 1." Davidson is aiming for a freshman class of 360 next fall, as one step
in the college's plan to increase enrollment from the present 1100 to 1500 by 1980.

New trustees Graeme Keith, Price Gwynn, and James McFarland will be installed. College President Samuel R. Spencer Jr. will then
give a general report and preview. (See TRUSTEES, Page 12)

The requests the Black Student Coalition (BSC) presented to the administration last October are facing both obstacles and encouragement. The
BSC proposal included requests for an African studies program, the addition of a black professor to the Davidson faculty, implementation
of an exchange program with black colleges, and increasing the enrollment of black students to 150. The only progress in
meeting these proposals so far has been the establishment of an exchange program with Morehouse College in Atlanta. The Administration
is also considering opening up other colleges to the exchange program.

"The Administration doesn't seem as though it's in much of a rush about the African studies program," said Steve Peck,
president of the BSC. "We received a pile of stuff from departments telling us what they offered. Things like parasitology
in the Biology Department. The Sociology Department said they could make a course on criminology on the blacks. A lot
of the departments just seem to be making excuses," said Peck.

According to Vice President for Academic Affairs John M. Bevan, Davidson has no intention of implementing an African studies program.
"We have a transcultural program in the formulative stages, but it's not ready to be presented for approval of the
Educational Policy Committee." As seen by Bevan, the transcultural studies would be courses "on how to study cultures in a
comparative way," concentrating on non-Western cultures, such as Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and including Latin America. "It's a
question of staffing and what courses others around us offer. It takes time and money to do it," said Bevan.
"Black studies around the country are on the way out financially."

As for progress in acquiring a black professor, Davidson currently has one professor from Johnson C. Smith University teaching a
communications course. "We're trying desperately for a black professor," said Bevan, "particularly in the area of political science and sociology
but we have not been successful. Most of the black professors are in the northeast and midwest. They're not likely
to come to rural North Carolina," he explained.

A goal of 30 has been set for black student enrollment for next year. Currently enrolled at Davidson are 21
black students, including two foreign students. According to Admissions Officer Larry Barr, about 26-28 blacks have already applied. "We hope
it will go around to 35-45 applicants. So far, applications from girls have been running pretty evenly with the boys,"
said Barr. "We're glad of the goal," said Peck, "but we're encouraging them to go over to get to the
one-tenth of the student body goal that had been set."

BSC has also presented some programs and has some planned for the future. "We were struck by the lack of
student response for the 'Journey into Blackness' program, and the Martin Luther King Day Memorial had very poor response," Peck
said. A gospel choir from UNCC will perform March 1. Also scheduled are films dealing with black history and black
problems.

CORRECTION
Some confusion has resulted from a story in last week's DAVIDSONIAN concerning faculty compensation, including various benefits, and not merely
salaries of faculty members. The actual median salaries of full-time faculty are $10,800, $11,400, $14,000, and $17,000 for instructors, assistant
professors, associate professors, and professors, respectively.
