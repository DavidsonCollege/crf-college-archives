The coming of winter means winter term, college and pro basketball, and the Winter Drama Workshop season. Student-performed and directed
plays are produced every Thursday and Friday at 7 p.m. in Cunningham Fine Arts Building. The following two plays were
put on last week.

**Dutchman by LeRoi Jones:**
Directed by senior Paul Kosmas, who was assisted by senior Wayne Magruder, the action takes place on a moving train.
Junior Vincent Knight played Clay, a young intellectual who meets with a universal nightmare—a stranger who will not leave you
alone. The stranger is Lula, a hooker played by senior Christi Hayes. Senior Eric McClarty played the conductor, senior Kerry
Brown a young man with a Bible, and junior Bill Madden a drunk. They have about two sentences in the
play. The rest of the play is a dialogue between Clay and Lula.

This play has all the curses of a one-act. With only one hour, the writer is tempted to drop plot
and go for talk about every vast issue of the cosmos. Jones fell for this solution. Clay emerges as an
overblown symbol of the castrated, middle-class black. Lula is the sexually repressed but secretly lustful white. Their delirious encounter on
a train is supposed to symbolize the entire truth about race and sex. The whole play has a delirious unreality.
Lula alternately screams and sexually teases Clay. You wonder why he would put up with such an obnoxious stranger. Clay
is pretty cold and frigid, unable to make up his mind on anything. You wonder why a whore would put
up with such a slow trick. They cavort, argue, and fight on a public train with other passengers. You wonder
why nobody calls the conductor.

The play had a few moments. Kosmas kept the play moving at a rapid clip with the appropriate train sounds.
Knight and Hayes took on their roles with energy and skill. They even got a few laughs out of the
sexual tension between their characters. Knight played the mildness and confusion of Clay in the right key, while Hayes got
all the pyrotechnics as Lula. Good performances and good direction struggled with a bad play.

**Wild Roses by John Marks, '85:**
Directed by senior Laeta Kalogridis, who was helped by sophomore Mac Hardcastle, the play was written by a Davidson alumnus.
It is set in a hospital bedroom. Sophomore Margaret Hancock played Sarah, the repressed and dominated daughter of a Southern
family. Senior Michele Miller played grandma, her tyrannical mother who is recuperating. Sophomore Mibs Raney played Angie, the rebellious granddaughter.
Senior Caroline Vinson played nurse Stipes.

The characters in the play are all Southerners, and this situation has its own temptations. Ever since Faulkner and Tennessee
Williams, morbid and bizarre behavior has become the literary use (and abuse) of the American South. No Southern family can
be normal without some incest. At the same time, Southerners go off into beautiful, poetic flights beyond the range of
Yankees. There is the South, and there is the South of the literary mind. Marks gave in completely to this
temptation. Before long, the rebellious Angie relates her sexual profile. Poor Sarah, her fragile dreams ripped apart in childhood, has
a nervous breakdown. Nurse Stipes is too common to understand. The play comes down to a struggle for power and
freedom between Grandma and Angie. These themes have been done before.

The entire cast did well in their roles. Hancock, Miller, and Raney had the major roles and held up under
the limelight. Vinson kept her country accent without a miss. Kalogridis did some interesting tricks with the spotlights which helped
the play’s themes. There was one problem. Angie, despite being brought up in the South, had no Southern accent.Here is
the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

---

Have to be a Yankee to be liberated? Dead-end position, until he realizes that this promotion will give him the
chance to find the girl of his dreams. Jill (Kim Greist) is a truck driver who looks exactly like the
medieval damsel in distress of Sam’s fantasies. When he does find her, she thinks he’s crazy and he thinks she’s
a terrorist. Needless to say, though a continuous thread of interest, the plot is essentially unimportant to the film as
it gives way to that all-ambiguous term, “atmosphere.”

If you can, see “The Purple Flower” and “Tongues.” Both plays are different from the norm. They are not comedies.
They are not clear-cut tragedies. In fact, at some times it is questionable as to whether there is a legitimate
plot in either of the plays. Why should you see these plays? See these plays because they are explorative, bizarre
(in the case of “Tongues”), and above all else, moving; and that is the purpose of drama.

“The Purple Flower” depicts the struggle of racism, pitting a cast of eight black actors and actresses against two white
characters who are referred to as the Male White Devil and the Female White Devil. The play is written from
the viewpoint of blacks. It deals with their perception of, and reactions to, the two White Devils who parade themselves
in tux and sequined dress, enjoying life, and manipulating the other characters by devilish means. Senior Eric McClarty gives a
stirring performance as an old man who strives for the creation of a third race of godly men to do
away with racism altogether. I feel his role in “The Purple Flower” is a much more demanding role than his
performance in “Sweeney Todd” last fall and he plays it beautifully. Excellent performances were also given by sophomores Melissa Givens,
as an old lady, and Maureen Harris, in the part of Cornerstone.

“Tongues” is a very different sort of play. “Tongues” is an individual exploration of communication and death. The play contains
five members dressed in black and white, who deliver personal messages of life and death to the peculiar sounds of
a one-man rhythm section positioned at center stage. Has this made sense? No? That’s what I thought when I saw
the play. However, this is an unjust crack for the play is clearer than I have made it out to
be. The acting is as consistently good as the characters are interesting. The characters range from a neurotic schizophrenic, played
by sophomore Brett Bakke, to a seeing-blind man played by senior James Pittard. Pittard has a natural innocence on stage
that makes him likable and believable. These certainly aren’t professional presentations, but this is not Broadway. This is Davidson and
admission is only two dollars. See “The Purple Flower” and “Tongues.” The worth of these performances far exceeds the cost.

Running amuck throughout this futuristic land are life-like pipes, ducts, tubes, and numerous electronic gadgets which seem to be the
modus operandi for all enterprises and private life. Ironically, nothing seems to work very well, if at all: Sam’s heating
system breaks down, his coffee-maker soaks his breakfast toast, an old woman’s face-lift falls apart, and Mr. Buttle is killed
instead of Mr. Tuttle. This pile of inefficiency and mistakes is buried beneath more piles of bureaucratic paperwork. No one
seems to mind that terrorists infrequently attack shopping centers, restaurants, and private citizens. A government minister proclaims, “we have it
under control,” and billboards announce “Happiness, we’re all in this together.” Despite its cultural commentaries, Brazil is no 1984, nor
a prediction of life in the near future. This film is a purposely unrealistic mixture of extremes; grotesque, comedy, horror,
and pathos meet in a fantastical dream which often turns into a chaotic nightmare. Unfortunately, it occasionally seems to turn
into a boring late-night video. Isolated and overdone sections cause the film to lag. However, Brazil works from a clever
idea and is sprinkled with interesting characters interpreted by talented actors, such as Robert DeNiro, Katherine Helmond, and Bob Hoskins.
This week’s showing is FREE in the 900 Room Saturday night at 8 p.m.
