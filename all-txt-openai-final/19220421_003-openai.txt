THE DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 21, 1921.

Seimet QUERY FOR APRIL 27.
Resolved, That the U. S. Government should accept the Ford proposal for the purchase of Muscle Shoals, Alabama.

DOCTOR FLEAGLE SPEAKS TO STUDENTS OF WAKE FOREST.
Prof. F. K. Fleagle had a very enjoyable trip to Wake Forest and Raleigh, N. C., on Monday of last
week. He gave two talks while at Wake Forest, and also visited N. C. State, at Raleigh, in order to
observe the work being carried on there. At 7 p.m. Monday evening he spoke to the Wake Forest Y. M.
C. A., the subject of his address being the “Ephebic Oath.” This was the oath that the young men of
Athens were required to take upon beginning their second year of military service. It pertained to the duties of their
state, country, and fellow-man. At 8 p.m. of the same evening Professor Fleagle spoke to the Spanish Club on the
subject of “Porto Rico.” This address covered the history, the present political situation, and the problems found in Porto Rico
at the present time. Professor Fleagle reports that Wake Forest has an enthusiastic Spanish club, the students showing an unusual
amount of interest in the language department. The club is working under the leadership of Professor Goodman. A very enjoyable
part of the trip was a meeting with an old friend, Mr. Frank Parker. Mr. Parker and Professor Fleagle were
associated together at the University of Porto Rico, Mr. Parker having charge of agriculture at that institution. He is now
government statistician for the State of North Carolina.

D. WARREN COX VICTORIOUS IN FRESH-SOPH DECLAMATION
In a spirited Fresh-Soph declamatory test between the members of the two lower classes of the Pandemic Literary Society, the
judges had a difficult time deciding the winner of the medal. However, after about 15 minutes of indecision, the judges
announced W. M. Cox as winner, with H. B. Price and D. B. Walthall close seconds. In the opening declamation
Price set a precedent for his opponents in his masterly delivery of “The Wrestler of Philippi.” Clark Fain followed with
the popular “Wandering Jew.” Cox delivered an extract from Woodrow Wilson’s “War Message to Congress” in a masterful manner. L.
B. Gibbs gave a flowing declamation, “Hannibal on the Alps,” and Walthall finished the quintet with his excellent “Soul of
the Violin.” This was one of the most interesting declamation contests held lately, and it is hoped that those in
the future will be able to measure up to it in every feature, subject matter as well as declamatory abilities.

D. JOE EARNEST IS MEDALIST IN DECLAIMING CONTEST.
Nine contestants struggled hotly for the judges’ decision at the Eumenecan Fresh-Soph declamation contest April 11, with J. R. Earnest
winning out. Each man did exceptionally well, giving the judges a difficult task in picking the medalist. Earnest gave “The
Corsican Boy” with such ease and power that his first place was assured. Elkins and R. G. White received reps.
The other six entrants were R. R. Jones, Briggs, Hopkins, Martin, Moss, and Paul Patterson.

D. PAT GILCHRIST WILL SPEAK AT NEXT SUNDAY’S SERVICE.
C. W. Gilchrist, ex-’22, better known to Davidson students as Pat, will be the “Y” speaker next Sunday evening. His
subject will be “Good Citizenship.” Pat is now representing the Hood Brick Company, of Atlanta, in Charlotte, having spent a
year at the University of Pennsylvania. Pat will make his speech under the auspices of the Civitan Club. It is
hoped that other speakers may be secured, each representing a different profession; but these plans have not matured as yet.

The University of Chicago announces only 600 courses for its summer session. Seems as though a student ought to find
something he'd like to take in that list.

The old-time Wildcat fighting spirit was much in evidence at Wake Forest last Thursday when desperate rallies in the eighth
and ninth innings, in which heavy hitting played a prominent part, enabled Davidson to overcome an eight-run lead and win
14-13. It is the first time in recent years that Davidson has been able to defeat the Baptists twice in
one season and proved that the Wildcats have a fast traveling aggregation.

The Wildcats kept plugging away, making one run in nearly every inning until the eighth. The Baptists confined their activities
mainly to the fourth frame when five hits, two bases on balls, two sacrifices, and about a half dozen errors
produced two runs for them. Davidson got busy in the eighth and scored three runs on three hits, a base
on balls, and an error. It went something like this: Sorrells and Brice walked, M. Erwin singled to center and
Crawford strolled, forcing in Sorrells. Bowden caught Brice off third while he was flirting with some sweetie in the grandstand,
but McLeod again jammed the sacks when Barnes missed his grounder. Pritchett stepped up to the plate next, but his
thoughts were far away. Apparently, they were centered in deep right field, so he sent the ball there to keep
them company. While the pellet was making its trip out and back again, three runs came over the rubber. Freeman
then came through with a single and Pritchett came across with the winning tally. Sorrells held the Baptists safely in
their half, turning three of them back in order.
