**Patterson Court Diaries**

**First-year reactions to First Night Down**

Few people would bother to dispute the fact that the Court is an integral part of the Davidson social scene,
and a lot of emphasis is placed on the freshman experience there. The Davidsonian asked three first-year writers to keep
diaries over the course of the semester, chronicling their experiences on Patterson Court and with the Davidson social scene in
general.

“After countless discussions, lectures, and information sessions concerning alcohol, sexuality, and drugs, the freshmen have finally been deemed fit to
join the Court. I can’t speak for the rest of the student body, but even after all of my ‘training’
I found myself wandering down the hill on Friday more confused than ever.

“You can’t go in the basement, and that’s where the drinks are... except for the beers offered as you walk
in the door.

“Nobody cares if you drink... unless you happen to run into an RA, or, better yet, campus security.”

**Night 1:**

“I felt welcome as soon as I stepped onto the back porch [at the first party], as members of the
frat circulated to introduce themselves as well as to provide the promised beer that we had heard so much about.
It was as though being at the Court made possible a new sort of freedom, away from the watchful eye
of the school. Here, it seemed, the students ruled.

“I spoke with several [house] members, whom I perceived to be the most enthusiastic frat members by far, each of
whom seemed genuinely happy to have me there and to tell me a little about their organization.”

**“First Night Down at Davidson College has become such a big deal to its students that it is more like
a tribal custom than it is a night of parties. With all the mating, drinking, and dancing rituals, one might
think they have, in fact, entered a highly important religious ceremony.

“I think very highly of Davidson students in the classroom, but I have been far less impressed with them on
the Court. What I saw there was pretty much what I had expected, but I was disappointed nonetheless.”

“I can’t help but feel sympathy for the administration, RLO, or whomever it is that continues to wage this pointless
battle to screen The Court with smoke and mirrors. For all of you (myself included) who took advantage of these
excellent special effects, let us remember, the next time that a complaint against double standards escapes our lips, that without
these same incongruities, Friday and Saturday would have proceeded in wholly different directions—towards Scrabble and sober Twister, for example.”

**“The [second] party was much more lively - that is, until the police shut it down because people were fighting
on the back porch. This left me with a pretty bad impression, not only of that particular fraternity, but also
of the Davidson social scene itself. I found myself wondering if Davidson is the kind of place in which drunken
fistfights are common.

“I have to say, though, that the police were...**

**Concert Preview: 106.5 The End Weenie Roast, Sept. 22**

It is a rare occasion to find an event as promising as the 106.5 The End Weenie Roast. On Sept.
22 at the Verizon Wireless Amphitheater in Charlotte, the hottest bands in rock will perform throughout the day. It will
be an international event, with bands from Canada, the U.K., and even Germany (well, not really) present. Nickelback, Filter, Our
Lady Peace, and Default are the headliners, yet the supporting cast of Goldfinger, Andrew W.K., Berlin (that’s right, the 80’s
cult classic!), and Doves could easily be the top draw at any other festival.

Nickelback will play the center stage this year and is returning after a successful set last year at the Weenie
Roast. Nickelback is the current leader in modern rock. Singer Chad Kroeger formed the band in 1995 and one year
later released the LP *Curb*. After forming their own label, Roadrunner Records, Nickelback released the highly successful *The State* featuring
hits like “Breathe” and “Leader of Men” and made waves in Canada that eventually led to their huge success in
the States. A year later, *Silver Side Up* was released. It featured such hits as “How You Remind Me,” “Too
Bad,” and “Never Again.” Nickelback, along with bands like Creed and Days of the New, emerged as grunge was beginning
to dissipate. All of a sudden, the post-grunge sound is just as alive today as it was 10 years ago
due in large part to Nickelback’s contributions. Though Nickelback has been described as a melodramatic band, the intensity and personal
connection Kroeger has with his songs makes them one of the best live performing bands today.

Filter appeared out of nowhere in 1995. Founder Rich Patrick worked extensively with Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails and
helped pave the way for the industrial music invasion of the early 90’s. Then Patrick left Reznor and formed Filter,
hoping to make a name for himself in the business. The first album *Short Bus* was an instant hit. The
second album *Title of Record* met with mixed reviews. By 2000, Rich Patrick was living in the shadow of Reznor
and the critics were especially hard on him and his sound. Filter’s third album, *The Amalgamut*, finds Patrick on top
and Reznor nowhere to be found. No one knows what has become of NIN, yet Filter is at their prime.
The rawness that was missing in *Title of Record* is alive and well in *The Amalgamut*. The first single “Where
Do We Go From Here” has invaded the radio waves and will attract the post-grunge fans into Filter’s electronic/rock sound.

Formed in Toronto in the early 90’s, Our Lady Peace is the dark horse of the music scene today. Hanging
around the alternative scene for...close to a decade, it has not been until recently that their unique pop sound has
received the recognition it deserves. Lead singer Raine Maida’s voice can stretch from a scratchy growl to a soulful serenade
which complements the range of talent his bandmates possess. Their current album ‘Gravity’ contains the hit single of the summer
“Somewhere Out There” and is perhaps their best work to date. Touring has never been too successful for the band,
yet this time around things will be different and the Weenie Roast promises to be a great way to start
off their North American tour. The third Canadian band of the main four, Default, is the surprise band of the
year. Their debut album ‘The Fallout’ has sold millions worldwide and the singles “Wasting My Time” see Concert, page 6
very effective in dealing with the situation. As awkward as it might be to have an officer at every party,
it is worth it when they can stop trouble before it gets out of hand, without having to hand out
citations and arrests all the time.

“Despite the heavy drinking that occurred on the Court, I was very pleased with the number of alternative options. There
were activities at the Union in addition to dry parties on Patterson Court. The Fire and Ice party at the
Outpost was where I had the most fun. There was no alcohol and the music was good. I danced with
my friends and had a great time. My experience with First Night Down was overall a positive one due to
the many activities available to me, but I don’t believe I'll become a member of the Patterson Court tribe any
time soon.”

Night 2: “Second Night Down had almost as much hype to deal with as First Night Down, especially due to
a rumor that it would be even better. Our first stop on this night turned out to be an awkward
and semi-depressing party going on inside and a few people standing in the drizzle on the back porch. I eventually
decided to check out the only other frat party of the evening. There was supposed to be a band, according
to the flyers, so I was confused when I got inside and there were a lot of people dancing to
CD music.”

“I get the impression that most people enjoyed themselves, whether listening to The Clef Hangers or one of the frat
bands. After all, with the ubiquitous Nelly song “Hot in Herre” blasting literally everywhere, how could anyone not have fun?”

One Hour Photo: harrowing suspenseful buildup tainted by anticlimactic end
By Matthew Bandyk, Staff Writer

From very early on in Mark Romanek’s One Hour Photo (Fox Searchlight Pictures), we know that Sy “the Photo Guy”
Parrish (Robin Williams) will do something terrible. The anticipation of that misdeed is what makes the film one of the
most effective thrillers in recent memory. But when the actual revelation finally comes, it’s a bit anticlimactic and ends this
nonetheless remarkable film on a sour note.

Reviewer Matthew Bandyk says Robin Williams’ performance in One Hour Photo is remarkable. Robin Williams dominates the film in his
role as Sy, the seemingly friendly film developer at a one-hour photo lab, the kind you would find at any
Wal-Mart (here called Sav-Mart) in America. Sy takes his job very seriously, as we find out from a series of
coolly detached voiceovers in which he reveals that he treats his customers’ photos as if they were his own. It
turns out that having the photos isn’t quite enough for him. Sy has developed a somewhat unhealthy obsession with his
longtime customers, the Yorkin family. The Yorkins seem to be the perfect family: two sophisticated and beautiful parents (Connie Nielsen
and Tom Cruise-wanna-be Michael Vartan) and a bright 9-year-old son (Dylan Smith), all living a wealthy life in their gorgeous
suburban home. But there’s trouble hidden below the surface at the Yorkin household. This dark underbelly seems to mirror the
violent outbursts that sometimes creep out from Sy’s friendly facade. In turn, Sy’s investigations into the Yorkin family become slowly
more aggressive and bold, building on the feeling of dread that makes this a truly suspenseful film.

Director Mark Romanek, well known for his music videos such as the classic “Closer” by Nine Inch Nails, gives the
film a cold and sterile ambience in the scenes involving Sy’s job at Sav-Mart, and a much warmer tone in
the Yorkin home, which is fitting as Sy’s dream seems to be to escape from his lonely existence and be
a part of this perfect family. But Williams steals the show; his performance as a mad killer in last year’s
Insomnia only hinted at the level of sinister he achieves here. A great example of his chilling work in One
Hour Photo is a scene in which Sy compares photography to the sport of hunting (with the accompanying gun-like noises
as he clicks off snapshots). Perhaps more impressive is his ability to make lonely, sad Sy someone the audience can
sympathize with as well as fear. Williams notwithstanding, this is definitely not a film for the squeamish; it has one
of the most disturbing dream sequences I’ve seen in any movie. Unfortunately, the conclusion is unable to fully live up
to the intensity that preceded it. Another major misstep is an attempt to present psychological motivations behind Sy’s actions at
the end of the film, taking away from the mystery that makes Williams’ character so scary to begin with. Despite
these shortcomings, One Hour Photo is definitely worth the ticket price, as it is probably the most harrowing film experience
you will find this fall.
