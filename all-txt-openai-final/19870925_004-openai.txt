**THE DAVIDSONIAN**

**Davidson welcomes new faculty members from home and abroad**

By MARGARET CARROL and PETE MANGONE

**Dr. Monique Guizard**

Dr. Monique Guizard, a visiting professor from Paul Valery University in Montpellier, joins the French department this year. Dr. Guizard received her doctorate in educational psychology and is a specialist in audiovisual methods of teaching languages. Although she normally teaches at Paul Valery University, she has also taught in Japan over previous summers and hopes to teach one day in Iceland and Norway. Guizard has published two books on methods of teaching French and a book of French verbs and their use with prepositions. Despite a contract offer to teach in China, Guizard chose to come back to Davidson after having taught here before in 1981. While at Davidson, she will teach French 11 and French 100.

Dr. Guizard is very interested in music, theatre, cinema, and dance, in which she participates in an international troupe with some students in France. She also attends aerobics class three times a week at the YMCA, saying that she needs to have exercise in order to be “dynamic” in class. Dr. Guizard brought her 85-year-old mother to Davidson for her first experience traveling abroad, and she left behind her husband, son, and grandson. Guizard will return to France in February, but she loves Davidson and especially Davidson students, who she says, “are marvelous, intelligent, serious, and — at times — humorous.”

**Mrs. Rosemary Raynal**

Mrs. Rosemary Raynal is another new face on the Davidson campus this year, although she taught at Davidson three years ago and at July Experience two years ago. Originally from Elkin, North Carolina, Raynal lives in Davidson now with her husband and two sons. Raynal graduated from UNC-G in 1968, and she received her master's from Southeastern Louisiana University in 1978. She has a one-year appointment at Davidson, where she will be teaching English 21 and writing for international students. Although she never imagined that she would end up teaching writing, she thoroughly enjoys her work. She also loves American and British literature.

Every summer, Mrs. Raynal spends a great deal of time organizing an annual summer trip for the youth in the community. During the past three years, the groups have taken two-week trips to Nova Scotia, Big Bend National Park, and Rocky Mountain National Park. The kids do a service project in addition to their traveling. Mrs. Raynal likes teaching at Davidson, where she enjoys both professional and personal relationships with students.

**Mr. John Haskell**

A Davidson graduate of the class of 1981, Mr. John Haskell has returned to Davidson for a year to be a guest lecturer while he completes his doctoral dissertation at UNC-CH. Although Haskell was born in Cleveland, Ohio, he has lived in North Carolina since his family moved to Chapel Hill. Haskell graduated from Davidson with a political science major and then received his master's from UNC-Chapel Hill in the fall of 1985. He also taught at Chapel Hill for two years as a graduate student. Haskell currently teaches two political science courses, Parties and Interest Groups (POL 120) and the Legislative Process (POL 121). Outside the classroom, Haskell enjoys basketball, tennis, and reading novels. Although somewhat biased toward Davidson students, Haskell notes that they are “extremely perceptive, and they participate a great deal in class.”

To help make up for the loss of the Professor Sutton husband and wife duo to the Montpellier, France JYA program this year, the French department has added the dynamic teaching abilities of Professor Carole Stitt. Originally from New York, she is presently a Ph.D. candidate at Duke University and is working on her dissertation concerning the political speeches of Victor Hugo. Stitt’s interest in French, she says, must be credited to her third-grade teacher, “a real francophile.” Stitt recalls that her teacher used to have French memorabilia everywhere in the classroom. She also used to teach the elementary students to sing French songs and exposed them to bits of French history. As she looks back, Stitt realizes that this teacher’s impression on her helped steer her in the direction of French studies. Eventually, these studies led to her spending a year in Paris as the assistant resident of Duke University’s program in France. In this capacity, she spent time at the University.of Paris, helping to organize American students’ efforts to register for classes (a hectic, confusing, and sometimes physically harmful activity there).

During her first term at Davidson, Stitt is teaching what she feels is the most enjoyable of classes, beginning French. This enjoyment arises from the opportunity these two classes give her to share her knowledge of French with students who are experiencing something totally new in their life. Succinctly, she states it is a process of “group discovery.”

When not teaching or correcting papers, Stitt likes to spend time with her husband, who like herself is an avid sailor. They often spend one day of the weekend on Lake Norman in their sailboat, enjoying the relaxing and yet exciting moments that sailing offers. In addition to recreational sailing, Stitt and her husband compete in regattas and even came home with a couple of trophies this past summer.

Professor Stitt is definitely a welcome addition to the Davidson faculty. As an innovative, fun, and caring professor, she undoubtedly brings with her the qualities of Davidson’s faculty that make Davidson College such a fine school.

SGA discusses new dorms and mandatory parking fees
By ROBERT SMALLEY

Last Tuesday night, the SGA convened its first senate meeting of the new school year. SGA President Conrad Doenges began the meeting by announcing the upcoming senate elections for freshmen and Patterson Court houses. He urged anyone who is interested in running for these seats to sign up in the Dean of Students’ Office before September 22.

The senate discussed the construction site of the new apartment-style dormitories. Because of water drainage problems similar to those which have affected several Patterson Court houses, Director of Facilities Planning Grover Meetze is hesitant to locate the new dorms in the wooded area between the soccer and baseball fields. Instead, Meetze favors putting the dorms where the Belk parking lot is currently located. To make up for lost parking, the satellite lot located near Irwin dormitory would be extended toward Lingle Manor. A final option would be to construct the dorms beyond Akers and Irwin, which would afford them a degree of quiet and seclusion. The senate desires and encourages students to voice their opinions on the site selection as soon as possible. Construction will begin soon so that the dorms should be completed by next fall.

Regarding the new parking fee, the senate discussed how the fee came about and whether it was necessary. Most senators agreed that a small fee was acceptable but were shocked to learn that it was $30. Doenges assured the senate that the receipts of the fee would be earmarked to improve parking.

A larger problem the senate discussed was the apparent lack of communication between the administration and the students on matters such as those discussed at the meeting. The senate hopes to reestablish open lines of communication between the administration and the student body and welcomes student suggestions on the matter.

This past Tuesday, the senate began its second weekly meeting of the year with a reminder that senate elections will be held in the coming week. All upperclassmen are encouraged to vote for house senators, and freshmen are urged to vote for class senators. Voting will be held this Tuesday, September 29, from 9:00 to 3:00 in the lobbies of Chambers and the Union.

The senate again discussed the proposed sites of the new dormitories. The administration is considering two sites: the Belk parking lot and the area behind Irwin and Akers. The SGA has been assured that if the Belk lot is used, more parking areas will be constructed prior to the closing of the present lot in the wooded area behind Lingle Manor. Although a final decision has yet to be made, the college hopes to have the matter settled within the next three weeks. All students are urged to let members of the SGA know their feelings on this matter.

The senate also heard from representatives from the carrier-current radio station project and approved their statement of purpose. The Activities Tax Council has allotted $250 for the project and the senate will be cooperative in any way it can. The group was encouraged to write a constitution and present it for senate approval.

Finally, students are asked to review the proposed academic calendar for next year. Senators would like to gauge student reaction. All opinions should be directed to Conrad Doenges or the faculty executive committee.
