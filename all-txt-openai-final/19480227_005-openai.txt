**Society Plans Varied Summer For Students**

PHILADELPHIA—The American Friends Service Committee will sponsor a variety of projects this summer, Clare Pickett, executive secretary, announced today. They range from aiding war-devastated cities in Europe to studying cooperatives in St. Paul, Minnesota, and from every section of the United States to Mexico, Europe, and Nova Scotia. Mr. Pickett estimated that there will be opportunities for approximately 500 college students to participate in the Service Committee’s college program. 

Unlimited numbers may attend the 12 institutes of International Relations. Helping to rebuild war-devastated areas, building a hostel for African Indians in Cuba City, Atlanta, building community centers in the southern United States and southeast Missouri, and preparing school facilities for small colleges in West Virginia and North Carolina will be some of the jobs which work campers will undertake. They will also help develop recreation programs in Howland, Maine, Detroit, and Chicago. Members of the Quaker International Voluntary Service team will help reconstruct homes and community buildings in Austria, Hungary, Italy, Poland, and the American zone of Germany. European organizations will sponsor similar camps in Finland, Belgium, Holland, France, England, Switzerland, and Germany. Americans wishing to participate in any of these camps should apply through the Service Committee.

Young men and women will aid in clinics and educational programs in six Mexican communities. There will be Spanish study for college credit in one of the Mexican projects. In institutional service units, students work as attendants in mental hospitals or correctional institutions. They receive the regular salary and attend a course of lectures at the same time. Those interested in industrial relations may join the Interne-in-Industry project in Philadelphia. Internes are responsible for finding their own jobs in industry. They live cooperatively together and participate in an educational program of lectures, discussion periods, and field trips. The Interne-in-Cooperatives project will be sponsored in St. Paul, Minn., and Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. As in Interne-in-Industry, actual work is supplemented by an educational program. Income of the internes is pooled to pay living expenses.

Problems of international cooperation and peace will be studied in international service seminars and institutes of international relations. In both these projects, well-known authorities on international affairs are available as faculty members, discussion leaders, and advisers. Institutes, conducted mainly for those whose time is limited, last for about ten days. Seminars last for seven weeks and are held for college students primarily.

**WHEN By KENNETH J. FOREMAN**

The fog is not unequalled for acquaintance before the conversation continues. It descends, it is not necessarily permanent. We cannot go back to that patriarchal society; we Occidentals are romantic individualists. Can we, surrounding and filling the valleys with a dense haze beforehand, do anything to ensure more permanent and happy results?

A simple comparison brings up one or two suggestions. If you are in a season when dense fogs may be expected, and if, when the fog lifts, you do not wish to find yourself stranded on a dead-end, one-way road, or bogged down in a marsh somewhere, you will take two obvious precautions. First, you will provide yourself with a good road map. Second, when the fog starts coming down you will not get into dangerous country at all; you will stick to good solid highways you can depend on.

In the journeys that end in marriage, the same precautions may be taken. Get a good road map and don’t let the fog catch you on a risky road. In plainer English: Get all the good advice you can in advance, and be sure the girls (or boys) you know are of such a sort that after the haze lifts you would not regret being tied up with one of them for life. As for advice, the old folks know more than you think they do. You have no doubt said to yourself, “It’s my life, why should they have anything to say about it?” Yes, but they are not in the haze themselves. And an airplane pilot may have a better idea of direction than a car driver right down in it. It’s his road, and his car; but the plane pilot may know more about it than the driver does. So your elders’ (and especially your parents’) ideas about other young people are worth far more than you are likely to think. If they seem prejudiced, as to some extent they are, there are any number of impartial good books on courtship and marriage; your minister may be able to suggest some to you. And if you are going to college, 

Books could be written about this, and they have been. Just one bit of free advice to Christian young people: Make your friends among other Christians. Never mind if the old people in the congregation look down their noses at the young people's society as a date-factory. So what? There is no better place for dates. If when that haze comes down it finds you with your best friends going to the same church, holding the same ideals, loyal to the same Christ, then when the fog lifts, you will find yourself on a good solid highway.people; there may be a helpful course. When the haze lifts, as lift it will, you will know what a fool I was; but rather—"I didn't realize what a happy choice I was really making.” The choice was made by older members of the family, or even by trusted employees, as in Genesis 24; the marriage in the sociology department somewhere. It is stupid, isn’t it, to go into the most important human relationship of life without ever having glanced at a map beforehand? 

In explaining this wholesale sounding out of youth, Miss Clara Keiser, executive director of the organization, commented, “Whatever foreign ministers or UN settle or leave unsettled, no top-level decisions can alone cure the human sickness that plagues our planet. We have got to allay the fears bred in people who are ignorant of the deepest and best in life. Thousands of letters in which the young plead out of full hearts for intellectual and spiritual contact with contemporaries beyond their national boundaries. They hope for a world that will give them the right to a happy childhood and help them live the rest of their lives in some degree of that human peace.”

Notice to Students and Faculty Members: You are urged by the editorial staff of THE DAVIDSONIAN to turn in any news copy that you think might be of interest to the student body.

THE HAZE LIFTS

Would you like to have letter-friends from foreign countries who are studying in the seminars? Last year, about 45 nationalities were represented. The committee wishes to have six or eight Americans in each seminar. Peace caravans carry the committee’s concern for peace directly to communities through teams of young people, whose activities include writing articles in local newspapers, making radio addresses, and speaking to groups. Their aim is to encourage communities to work more actively for peace. Two caravans will be sponsored on the West Coast.

In addition to the college credit given for Spanish in one of the Mexican projects, credit has also been given by a number of colleges in psychology and sociology. Information on maintenance and other details is available upon request from the Office of the College Program, American Friends Service Committee, 20 South 12th Street, Philadelphia 7, Pa.

A call to earth’s young to tell how they are working for a warless world is being issued by Youth of All Nations, Inc., from its headquarters in New York. Boys and girls, young men and young women, in every accessible country and island on the globe—including the islanded stateless in DP camps—are being asked to speak out on the following questions:
1. What are your own most urgent problems?
2. What do you believe the youth of your country can contribute to the building of a peaceful world?
3. What are you as an individual doing in this respect, and what would you like to do?
4. Do you belong to a youth organization? Exactly how is it helping?

When all groups have been heard from, the whole story will be told.

Youth of All Nations, Inc., begun during the war as a simple effort to help newly arrived refugee children make letter-friends in various states of the U.S.A., has evolved into a sort of correspondence course in humanity. By a unique system of individual exchanging, it helps the young of all nations, races, and religious beliefs to understand—and so to like each other better. “In a brilliant recent speech, heard by far too few,” Miss Leiser added, “Pearl Buck observed that although youth in the U.S. is provided with endless activities, the content of its life is thin. Young people are not enough a part of what is going on in the world. They are being cheated if they aren't made aware that their own town is a part of the world community. The quickest way to develop a feeling of kinship with that community is by learning from human beings themselves.” Youth of All Nations, Inc., now offers that opportunity to young people everywhere, whether they are individuals or groups.
