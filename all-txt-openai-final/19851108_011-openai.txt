Comments on American-Soviet summit

Bruce Sarkisian

In a little under two weeks, President Reagan will have his first summit with a Soviet leader since he took
office. Over the past few months, the Soviet propaganda machine has been expertly molding world opinion to think that Reagan,
with his “Star Wars” program, presents a serious challenge to constructive negotiations, while Gorbachev, the (relatively) young, charismatic leader of
the Soviets, is a benevolent peacemaker, fervently hoping to reduce the threat of nuclear war in our time. Hopefully, most
of us will not fall into the trap of this honey-tongued rhetoric and think our President a merciless war-monger. Rather,
I hope that this propaganda will make us more wary of the tricks the Soviet government can play, and will
make us go into the summit with wider eyes and clearer minds.

Gorbachev is trying to over-stress arms control at the summit, particularly the development of “Star Wars,” in order to avert
the world’s eyes from the “dirty little wars” he is carrying on in countries in which the U.S.S.R. has no
business being involved. According to President Reagan’s speech to the United Nations, at present, there are 118,000 Soviet troops in
Afghanistan, 140,000 Soviet-supported Vietnamese soldiers occupying Cambodia, Cuban troops with Soviet advisors in Ethiopia and Angola and 8,000 Soviet and
Cuban military personnel in Nicaragua. The people of these countries are victims of Marxist-Leninist ideology, which in itself is bad
enough, but when imposed against one’s will, it becomes all the more tyrannical. When the Soviets began their expansionist policies
into Ethiopia and Angola during the mid 70s, they essentially destroyed all the good relations that President Nixon helped establish.
It is now up to Reagan and Gorbachev to reestablish some form of this detente. Admittedly, the U.S. has its
own “dirty little war” going on in Nicaragua as well, but this is only to counteract the Soviet threat. I
am hopeful that the two countries can work out a plan where they both pull out of Nicaragua; however, if
we are going to pull out, we must be sure that the Russians will too, and that they will curb
their expansionist policies elsewhere.

As far as arms control, the only reason the Soviets want to see “Star Wars” scrapped is that they don’t
have the technology to build it. So far, the only proposal that the Russians have made is that they will
reduce their nuclear weapons only if we drop “Star Wars.” The reason the Soviets feel threatened by “Star Wars” is
that they know it will render most of their nuclear weapons useless. The U.S. should not drop “Star Wars” and
should not enter into an arms treaty of any kind unless it is mutually verifiable. As we have recently seen,
the Soviets violated the SALT II arms treaty with respect to nuclear testing, and we have to learn not to
take the Soviets on their word alone.

During the past few weeks, U.S. and Soviet officials have been meeting to lay the groundwork for the upcoming summit.
When asked by the press if there is any hope for the summit, officials from both sides said there are
“seeds” and “nuggets” of hope. To quote George J. Church in Time magazine of November 4, “The challenge of Geneva
will be to nourish, rather than trample upon, (these) seeds that, by even the most optimistic reading, are exceedingly rare
and fragile.” I agree with this statement; I just hope that we are not taken in by the crafty Soviet
propagandists in the process.
