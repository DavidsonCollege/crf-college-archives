versus Division I programs, among them two games against a Southern Conference team, Western Carolina. Next year the ‘Cats will
play all Division I teams and will play every school in the Southern Conference once. Beginning in 1994-95, the Davidson
women’s basketball program will be a full-fledged Division I program and will play a full Southern Conference schedule.

Filar admits it is hard to make expectations for such a young team. “I only tell my players to play
their hearts out... not to have any regrets when they come off the court,” Filar says. “I feel we played
that way last year. People will be surprised... at the level women’s basketball can be played at now. They will
see flashes of brilliance [with this team], and then will see flashes of inexperience. But this team works hard, and
I don’t feel anyone who sees us will go away thinking we didn’t play hard.”

With sophomores likely rounding out the starting lineup, this team appears to be well-situated to contend seriously for the next
two years. Next season, three current juniors who are studying abroad will rejoin the team and should strengthen it considerably.

“I want [the freshmen] to learn to compete on the college level and handle the nervousness,” Oddo said. “I don’t
care who you are, you can beat anybody on any given day and that is the attitude you have to
develop.”

Leading the team will be sophomores Derek Spencer (in the 142 and 150 lbs divisions) and Jared Glick (150 and
158) and freshman Sean Harvey (126 and 134). Other members of the team include Robbie Fierro, Francis Mitchell, and Henry
Neale.

The heavyweights, some of whom just began practice after the conclusion of football season, include Bo Bartholomew, Tommy Greene, James
Cassidy, and Brian Parrish.

After surprising performances in the team’s two preseason invitationals, Oddo is looking forward to this season and also is excited
about next season. “The whole key to the year will be the three things,” he said: “experience, recruiting and the
return of those three starters.”
