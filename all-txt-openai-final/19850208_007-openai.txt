**Davidson Garners Conference Win Over Furman**

**Wildcats Now Ranked Fifth In Nation In Free Throw Shooting**

By ANDY BARRON

Davidson ended its latest week of Southern Conference basketball with a solid 84-70 win over Furman. An 11-2 surge by
the Wildcats late in the first half gave a commanding 36-21 halftime lead that was never threatened in the second
half. The Furman game ended what had been a frustrating week on an optimistic note. Davidson started the week with
a tough 62-52 loss to those fine gentlemen from UT-Chattanooga. Then Appalachian State handed Davidson its third straight loss by
beating Davidson 73-70. The Cats are now 9-14 overall and 5-5 in the conference.

The UTC game was, in a word, tense. The Mocs lead the conference (they are 9-1 currently) and both teams
were obviously ready to play. At first, it was all Davidson. The Cats took an 18-8 lead on a slam
dunk by freshman Jeff Himes with 8:25 left in the half. However, “Gentleman Gerald” Wilkins of UTC had already created
some tension by pushing Davidson freshman Derek Rucker and speaking some words that sophomore Chris Heineman said “weren’t fit to
print.” Whatever the effects of the tension and flying elbows were, UTC crept back into the game and trailed Davidson
only 24-21 at halftime.

Heineman summed up the second half: “They got red hot and we went cold. Turnovers and poor shot selection really
hurt us. But they didn’t miss anything and that killed us.” UTC shot an astronomical 75 percent from the field
in the second half and took the lead for good with 10 1/2 minutes remaining. The Mocs were led by
Wilkins’s 14 points while Davidson was paced by Rucker’s 14 and junior Pepper Bego’s 12.

“I knew it would be a very physical game,” said junior Gerry Born, who had 8 points and led the
team with 8 rebounds. “I didn’t think the physical nature of the game hurt us because I thought it woke
us up.”

“The referees really let the game get out of hand,” sophomore Ace Tanner said. “Late in the game they tried
to make up for it by calling little fouls. I think that hurt us because we couldn’t make any steals
without having a foul called and were thus unable to make any kind of comeback.”

Davidson once again got an early lead against Appalachian State. However, the Mountaineers erased an eight-point deficit with a 17-2
tear midway through the first half. But Davidson came back thanks to some heroics by Tanner. ASU hit a shot
at the buzzer and led by six at the half.

“We didn’t execute during the stretch they outscored us 17-2,” junior Ken Niebuhr said. “They were playing well, but we
didn’t help ourselves the way we were playing offense.”

“We took bad shots and stood around,” Bego said. “They took it to us and we weren’t taking it right
back to them.”

Davidson wasted no time getting back in the game in the second half. Rucker hit a jumper from the top
of the key to knot the score at 45.All with 16 minutes remaining. For the rest of the half, the
game was tight. State grabbed a 65-60 lead with four minutes left and appeared ready to take control of the
game. However, the Cats refused to give up until Ron Fiorini hit two big free throws with 37 seconds remaining;
the outcome was very much in doubt. “We beat ourselves,” said Himes, Davidson's leading scorer with 17. “Our failure to
execute really hurt us.” So did Appalachian State’s balanced attack that had four players in double figures led by Glenn
Clyburn’s 19.

Unlike the UTC and ASU games, Davidson had trouble getting started against Furman. Davidson took the lead for good only
three minutes into the game. But the Cats couldn’t break away from the Paladins until an 11-2 surge that finished
the first half and gave Davidson a 36-21 halftime lead. Davidson maintained a commanding lead throughout the second half. Furman
could never mount a serious comeback due to Davidson’s fine free throw shooting and superior talent. Davidson is currently fifth
in the nation in free throw shooting at 78.1 percent after the Furman game. Davidson was led by Himes’s 19
points and 6 rebounds. Double-figure efforts were also posted by Bego (12), Rucker (11), and Niebuhr (10).

Davidson has a tough four-game road trip that will have a profound effect on Davidson's placing in the conference. A
strong finish is important so that Davidson gets a strong seeding in the Southern Conference Tournament. The next game is
at the friendly confines of UTC, a place where Davidson is sure to be warmly welcomed. After that, Davidson travels
to East Tennessee, Marshall, and The Citadel. If Davidson can win at least two of these games, it will return
with a great shot at a winning record in the conference.
