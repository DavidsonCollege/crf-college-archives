The athletic elite of '41, '91, and every class in between gathered last Saturday evening to induct four new members
into the Davidson College Hall of Fame. With the additions of Harry Fogleman, John Kuykendall '59, James Thacker '55, and
Virginia "Gigi" Cooke Tysinger '91, the Hall now houses 60 portraits commemorating the contributions of outstanding individuals to Davidson athletics.
Present members and the inductees joined friends, family, and other Davidson community members at a reception and induction dinner.

College president Bobby Vagt opened the evening by highlighting the beginnings of Davidson athletics in the nineteenth century, commending those
committed to preserving the school’s strong traditions. After an athlete’s dinner of prime rib and potatoes, Terry Hines '91 acknowledged
the Hall of Fame members or their representatives present. Athletic Director Jim Murphy '78 then introduced the four inductees, unveiling
the black-wrapped and red-ribboned portraits that will hang in the Hall of Fame in Belk Arena.

The Inductees

Harry Fogleman remains one of Davidson’s most successful tennis coaches, evidenced by his 175-69 record over 11 years and six
Southern Conference championships. The only Davidson coach to win two conference championships in the same school year, Fogleman also coached
soccer from 1962 to 1972, earning an 81-33-8 record and two Southern Conference championships. Fogleman’s daughter, too moved by the
sight of his portrait, simply and sincerely thanked the school.

John Kuykendall led the 1958 soccer team to its first winning season. More widely known as the president of Davidson
College from 1984-97, Kuykendall’s tenure was marked by significant athletic advancements, completion of Baker Sports Complex and Belk Arena, the
restart of women’s basketball and three NCAA Soccer Cups. Now a religion professor, Kuykendall’s acceptance speech paid tribute to the
“bumblers, fumblers, and uncoachable screw-ups,” among whom he counts himself, who nevertheless “loved Davidson athletics enough to make occasional fools
of themselves.”

James Thacker, a 1950s football phenom, holds the third highest rushing career total (1,676) and the school record yards per
run average (5.6). He also holds the single run record for a 98-yard touchdown against George Washington (the university, not
the president, as Jim Murphy noted) in 1952. Acknowledging Kuykendall’s entertaining acceptance speech—“How would you like to follow a Davidson
College president?”—Thacker first thanked his wife, calling their engagement his “greatest extracurricular achievement” while at Davidson. After thanking roommates and
teammates, family and friends, Thacker remarked, “This evening’s celebration serves to cap a very wonderful Davidson experience. Thank you, and
go, ’Cats!”

Virginia “Gigi” Cooke Tysinger was a field hockey star in her Davidson career; her 82 points remain the program’s record.
Her 36 goals are the second highest in Davidson history, and, with ten career assists, she holds that record. Team
captain for two years, Tysinger helped lead the team to its best record ever (14-1-2) during her senior year. Tysinger,
the youngest inductee of the evening, confessed to being “deeply humbled” by the honor. She paid tribute to her former
coach and teammates, saying, “I’m still in awe of the women I played with.” Citing the program’s rocky start, she
said the team “knew how to have fun and learned to win.”

Following dinner, the inductees and most others present headed...to Belk Arena for the men’s basketball game against Western Carolina. In
a halftime photo-op and presentation ceremony, the newest members of the Hall of Fame were publicly acknowledged and honored, including
the Davidson College 2002 Hall of Fame inductees (l-r) Harry Fogleman, Bill Giduz, John Kuykendall, James Thacker, and Virginia Cooke
Tysinger.

### Wrestlers continue to struggle with injuries

Constant injuries and athletes quitting continue to plague the Davidson wrestling squad. For the sixth competition in a row, the
Wildcats have not had enough wrestlers to officially count their matches. The NCAA requires that at least seven wrestlers compete
in order for the match to count; Davidson has been wrestling with four.

Much of the debate over Wildcats leaving the squad has come from a demanding workout program. However, for those who
have remained, the competition is far from over. Senior captain Jeff Bender explains, “We’ll be wrestling as individuals, technically, for
the rest of the year, and we still get to go to the conference tournament to wrestle individually there.”

Bender (157 pounds) has proved himself on the individual side of wrestling, improving his conference record to 2-0, and has
not lost a match in the last five competitions. On Jan. 22, the Wildcats opened their Southern Conference season with
competition against Appalachian State. Though the team finished 46-3 overall, Bender managed to pick up his first Southern Conference win,
beating Ryan LaRue in an 8-5 decision. Unfortunately, this was the only win of the day for the Wildcats.

Appalachian’s Steve Fox handled junior Grant Doornbos (149) to win the competition, 6-3. Appalachian’s Mark Fee, the defending Southern Conference
champion at 165 pounds, easily took down sophomore Mark O’Hair, 15-1. Finally, in the 197-pound division, freshman Brandon Zeigler lost
a close decision to Mark Hobbs, 3-1.

The Wildcats were back in action on Saturday, January 26, this time with only three wrestlers—Zeigler was unable to compete
due to injury. Once again, Davidson took a beating, losing 48-3 to conference rival UNC-Greensboro. Bender was the only ’Cat
able to score any points, coming away with a close victory against Nate Parmenter. Parmenter led Bender 2-0 in the
first period before Bender tied the match in the second period, and locked down the match-winning point with only 23
seconds remaining.

In the only other competitions of the day, both O’Hair and Doornbos competed fiercely, but, in the end, could not
manage a win. Ron Williams of UNC-Greensboro snuck by O’Hair with a 3-2 decision, while Doornbos lost a close match
to UNC-Greensboro’s Keith Ritter in a 9-8 riding time decision.

The ’Cats are next in action on Saturday, Feb. 1, when they take on the Duke Blue Devils in Durham,
NC. The first match begins at 7:30 p.m.
