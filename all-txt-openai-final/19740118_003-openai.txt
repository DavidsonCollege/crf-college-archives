Christmas Fund Revives Meaningful Tradition

To all members of the Davidson College community:

On behalf of the Davidson-Cornelius Day Care Center, I thank you for your generosity and concern in designating your Christmas
Gift Fund for use by the Center. As you know, the Center serves 40 children from one-parent families or from
families where both parents work. These families pay a fair share of the cost of care for these children, but
much of the expense of operating the Center must be obtained from individual gifts and grants from foundations and industries.
Your gift of approximately $1500 is a significant part of the $25,000 needed this year. With your help, along with
that of others, we are moving towards the achievement of our goal and the assurance of quality child care for
families in Davidson and Cornelius.

I also want to express my pleasure in seeing the revival of a good tradition. In years past, the Davidson
College Christmas Gift Fund has been a significant force for good in this community and in other places in the
U.S. and abroad. Those individuals and organizations who initiated and implemented this revival are to be congratulated.

Again, thanks!

John D. Kelton, president
North Mecklenburg Child Development Association
Davidson, N.C.

Councils Begin Liaison

By HUGH MOORE
Senior News Editor

The recently-implemented Departmental Advisory Councils are now ready to function as liaisons between students and the faculty members of their
respective departments. Instituted in the fall of 1973 by action of the SGA Senate Executive Committee, the councils are the
product of the planning of Seniors Todd Eades and Bo Phillips who felt the need for increased student input in
the academic departments.

According to its size, each department has been assigned by the Senate an advisory council consisting of one, two, or
three students. It is hoped that the councils will provide a valuable service, informing faculty and students in the departments
of each other’s suggestions and criticism. Specifically, the councils plan to focus their attention on departmental requirements, the addition of
new courses and the dropping of old ones in the curriculum, and the subjects of prospective seminars.

There will be an open meeting in Perkins Auditorium to discuss the 1974-75 operating budget on Monday, Jan. 21, at
10 a.m. Students may pick up a copy of the summary budget, which shows actual income and expenditures for 1972-73,
budgeted figures for 1973-74, and tentative figures for 1974-75, at the Comptroller's Office after 2 p.m. today. Summary budgets also
will be available at the open meeting.

Three Fluent German Helps Kyle Secure Rhodes

By ANNE PELFREY
Staff Writer

Davidson Senior Pete Kyle has won a Rhodes Scholarship, the most prestigious graduate study scholarship award available to American college
students. This week, he discussed the application and interview processes that he completed to win the scholarship.

“I'd always known that the Rhodes Scholarship existed, but until this fall, the thought never occurred to me to apply,”
he said. “In fact, I probably wouldn't have applied if Brown Patterson hadn't encouraged me to do so.”

Kyle said that early in the fall, Professor of History Brown Patterson suggested that he apply, in view of his
particularly high grade-point average and his experiences on the JYA program in Marburg, Germany last year. Kyle had been appointed
assistant to his mathematics professor at Marburg last year.

“I never thought I'd get one, but I felt that if I didn't apply, I would probably kick myself later.
It’s a once-in-a-lifetime shot.”

When asked why he wanted the scholarship, Kyle said that he had so enjoyed his previous year in a European
university that he wanted to return for graduate study. He also mentioned that the prospects of studying for a year
at Oxford especially excited him. “The German university experience was very different from what I had known at Davidson, naturally,
but the English educational system differs from both. I think it will be better than both.”

Whereas his studies at Davidson had been closely supervised by faculty members, at Marburg Kyle found himself completely on his
own. “Students at Marburg get no personal attention. Lectures seem very excited about it.”The students of the Mathematics Advisory Council
have already met and are discussing a possible pre-calculus course or some other alternative to Calculus 25 as the first
required mathematics course. SGA President Blain Rutner expressed optimism regarding the advisory councils, emphasizing their general communicative possibilities. “The only
thing lacking now is the student reaction. We know students have criticism and these councils will serve as a means
to extract it. The same also applies from the faculty side of the picture,” he said. “The idea has a
lot of potential,” he concluded. “Most of the professors I've talked to are on a non-mandatory, non-credit basis and the
only contact with the faculty is through seminars. An Oxford course of study, though, is based on the tutorial concept.
There's a great deal of contact with young professors and that’s what particularly interests me,” he explained.

Kyle plans to study logic at Oxford and eventually return to the United States to complete a doctorate in mathematics.
He hopes to eventually teach on the college level. Applicants for the Rhodes are evaluated on the basis of a
written essay and their performance in two separate interviews, one at the state level and one at the district level.
Kyle explained that the essay was to be quasi-autobiographical, in which the applicant was to state and discuss his interests,
experiences, and career aims. From the information in the essay, the interviewing boards prepared questions pertinent to each individual applicant
and in this sense, customized each interview.

“The state level interview was a fairly low-pressure one. The board inquired further about my interests and future plans. I
suppose they wanted to find out what type of person I am. But the district interview was very pressurized. They
knew I had been in Marburg so they began the interview in German and that took me by complete surprise.
They asked me to discuss the history of the university at Marburg and later to discuss the impact of Napoleon
and Bismarck on German education, all of this in German and they expected me to reply in German,” he said.

Kyle pointed out that the strategy of the district interviewing board was to ask very detailed questions in the applicant's
field to see how much he knew and to see how he would react under that sort of pressure. The
district interviewing board consisted of seven members, each being responsible for the questioning of two applicants. Each board member would
prepare questions from his two applicants' essays and conduct the major portion of their interviews. “In one instance, I was
a bit lucky. During the plane ride to the competition, I was reading about Galileo and one of the questions
asked in the interview concerned Galileo's telescope.” (See KYLE, Page 12)
