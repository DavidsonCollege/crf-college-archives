International studies raises discussion

By DONALD CALDWELL

The amount of money budgeted annually for international scholarships as well as its allocation have exposed a wide divergence of
opinion regarding the International Studies Program. The program’s budget itself has been static at $20,000 since 1974, and some note
that the inflation during the recent four years has significantly eroded the sum in absolute terms. Other factors have reduced
this amount further. Vice President for Academic Affairs T.C. Price Zimmermann commented that spaces at British universities for foreign students
have decreased markedly in the past decade, with an accompanying increase in fees.

Davidson students returning from a year at the Universities of East Anglia and Reading have felt their tuition of $1500
far too high and asked the Administration for a decrease. The administration agreed to reduce the figure to $750 annually.
"That $1500 fee had been used to subsidize an English student’s way here. We had to make up the difference
by using International Education funds," said Zimmermann.

Coordinator of International Studies Tony Boon added, "In order to maintain Davidson's sending students, we had to reciprocate by accepting
British students. Presently, we send six students to East Anglia and four to Reading. We have one student annually from
East Anglia and one on alternating years from Reading. We will have representatives from each in 1978-79."

Zimmermann cited that "the result is we have fewer funds for foreign students." Many professors have voiced concern over the
administration’s action and the resulting drop in available funds. Director of South Asian Studies Tonia Devon felt there would be
a diminishing number of students from third world countries. "We have one non-western student coming and an African from the
University of Nairobi on a $4500 scholarship. The program with Cairo University has been scrapped. I think this is an
indication of our priorities."

Boon countered, "Even though we don’t have a strong relationship to St. Stephen’s in Delhi, Cairo University, and the University
of Nairobi, that does not mean they will be eliminated. We simply need to make what we get go as
far as possible." Zimmermann concurred, "We are trying to apportion money among non-European students, from Africa and Japan in particular."

Yet doubt about the school’s interest in the program and its future remains. Professor of French Lauren Yoder, member of
the International Education Advisory Committee, stated "I realize we are committed to reciprocal arrangements with Britain but I wonder where
the commitment really is." Another professor not in the committee pointed out that many found it difficult to support the
program when many foreign students participating seemed indifferent or disillusioned.

US and world news

Washington—President Carter has overruled the recent Joint Chiefs of Staff’s decision to delay withdrawal of American troops from South Korea
until Congress had agreed to give military supplies to South Korea.

Washington—Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin was in Washington Monday to celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of Israel’s existence. At the reception,
President Carter pledged eternal American support for Israel in what Begin later hailed as "one of the greatest moral statements
ever made."

Washington—President Carter’s proposed arms sales package to Saudi Arabia and Egypt is encountering great opposition, especially among the Jewish forces
in Congress. The proposal requires an approval within 30 days from both the House and the Senate. While most members
of Congress would like to examine arms sales to each country separately, the Carter administration insists that the proposal will
remain a package deal.

Asia—Vice-President Mondale is making a five-nation Southeast Asia tour this week, arriving first in the Philippines where he held talks
with Philippine president Marcos. The talks centered mainly on recent relations between the two nations, and human rights.

Compiled by Mary Booth.the project’s stable budget, Boon commented, “I’d love to see more foreign students here, but money is
tighter than it has been in the past. I do not see a correlation between a fixed budget figure and
a decrease in our funds.” Professor of English Frank Bliss, another member of the advisory committee, added, “I would hope
funds for the international program will increase, and such an increase has been talked of about every year. I think
it is of immense value to the campus to have it continued.” “I am impressed they are continuing to fund
the program in the face of inflation. I realize other colleges and universities have had to hold the line.” Zimmermann
acknowledged, “I think you could argue that there has been a slight deemphasis of the scholarship program. Some of the
needed money has been provided by home governments or private scholarship funds.” Boon concluded by saying, “The administration has decided
that it would be appropriate that international students as educational tools be maintained.”
