### SPORTS SCENE By LEGH SCOTT

#### Renewal of Old Rivalry

When the Wildcats engage Georgia Tech at Grant Field in Atlanta Saturday, it will be a renewal of an old rivalry dating back to 1900. The two schools have met eleven times on the gridiron, the last contest being played in 1922 with the Ramblin’ Wrecks triumphing by 19-0. In all, the Cats defeated the Techs three times (the first three games of the series) and lost the remaining eight games to their more powerful opponents.

In renewing this series with Tech, the ’Cats, unable to break into the winning or scoring columns this season, find themselves up against one of the most formidable foes in the nation. The Engineers are undefeated, boast victories over powerful Auburn and one of Notre Dame’s best teams in years; they were rated fourth in the nation by the Williamson system last week. In short, Bill Alexander’s boys are riding high, and they may not be expected to let up for the little Davidsons, with a homecoming crowd on hand to be impressed.

In view of these hard facts, it might be expected that the Wildcats are taking that long trip just for the ride and a taste of deep-southern municipal hospitality. That is not the case. Davidson teams are not built that way. This year’s team has played some good football and a good bit not so good, but they showed their possibilities against State as well as on other isolated occasions. They are itching for a touchdown, and it could come at Ga. Tech's expense as it has at Duke’s on numerous occasions. Anyway, although you need not look for a victory Saturday or even a close score, you can count on the boys getting in some good licks before the final whistle.

#### Bethea Boots ’Em

A bright spot looms out of the otherwise gloomy scene in the Davidson football picture: Red Bethea’s kicking in the two games in which he has participated. Big Red's play last season was so outstanding that sports writers placed him on the All-American check list for this year, along with Herb Rainey, the ’Cats’ reliable, veteran lineman. Bethea came to us from Dillon, S.C., via Woodberry Forest. After doing yeoman’s service on the yearling team, he moved into the starting lineup on the varsity last year. His kicking for the season averaged 47 yards. Hardly less notable was his performance at backing up the thin red line where he broke through time after time to throw opposing backs for losses. His blocking was vicious.

It was a shame for such a player to be injured before the season started. Red’s tackling and blocking have been missed and probably will be missed for some time because of his weak collarbone. But he is back in there kicking with amazing consistency. Earle averaged better than 41 yards in his initial appearance against Rollins. In the V.P.I. game, he kicked 8 times for an average of 47 yards, including one blocked kick. Two of his boots went for 70 yards. That is kicking! “Bonnie Ben” Washburn added his bit to the average in placing two kicks, a total of 95 yards, down the field.

#### More Odds and Ends

At Blacksburg last Saturday, it was simply a story of too much V.P.I. power in the line. The ’Cat forwards repeatedly held the Gobblers short of the goal line even though they were vulnerable in midfield. But the Davidson line was unable to outcharge the larger opponents on offense, and the backs never had a chance to get started with a running or passing attack. The Frosh had an easy time of it in disposing of P.J.C., but their play left much to be desired. They will definitely have their hands full tomorrow in their game with the Carolina Tar Babies. Reports have it that the U.N.C. frosh line averages 201 pounds... but the bigger they come, etc. So go get ‘em, Kittens.

South Carolina continues the cry for freshman participation in varsity conference games; however, it is unlikely that any action will be taken with the big boys opposed to it (including Davidson). Tech will probably play some frosh against the ’Cats. Bruce and Rainey, both suffering from leg injuries, will probably see only limited action this week. O’Hair complicated his ankle trouble in the game last week, but should be ready for plenty of action. Congrats to the non-frat-men for organizing a touch team to compete with the Greeks. This team will not be eligible for the cup, but their addition to the schedule gives an outlet in intramurals to many formerly left out upon completion of the class games.

#### VETERAN LINEMAN

Herb Rainey has been a steady lineman for three years. Originally a guard, he has been moved over one slot to fill a gaping hole at tackle this year. One of two Davidson players on the sports writers All-America check list, he has continued to play outstanding ball this year. His inaction last week due to injury was sorely felt.

#### Listless ‘Cats Lose To V.P.I. By 16-0 Score

Virginia Gobblers used every scoring device in the books except the point after touchdown to down the Davidson Wildcats 16 to 0 in their clash in Blacksburg last Saturday. The score in the game Saturday was the same which the Gobblers used to spoil the Homecoming Celebrations here at Davidson last year. The kicking of True-Toed Roger McClure, who booted both of Virginia Tech's field goals Saturday, was also a feature of last year's encounter. His first miss of the extra point was this year.

#### Unusual Score

Although the Gobblers were able to push through the hard-fighting Davidson line for only one touchdown, they managed to score in every period. McClure’s kick from the thirty accounted for the score in the initial period, a safety in the second, another of McClure's placements in the third, and both a touchdown and a safety in the final quarter gave the Gobblers their unusual score.

The kicking of big Red Bethea was the outstanding feature of the game from the Wildcat’s standpoint. Bethea and Washburn together kicked eleven times for an average of forty-seven yards, and one of the kicks was blocked.

#### 'Cats Stalled

The ‘Cats were unable to make a single scoring threat when the Gobblers stopped their passing attack. The Davidson Eleven failed to gain a single yard through the air. The entire Wildcat line played good defensive ball, and though Tech gained 214 yards rushing, the only time they got within the Davidson twenty was in the last quarter when they pushed across their lone touchdown. Mac Bruce missed the Tech game because of his injured knee, and it is still doubtful whether or not he will be ready for action against the powerful Georgia Tech Eleven Saturday. The rest of the team came through without serious injury.

#### Soccer Team Opens Season

Wednesday morning at 8:30, the college soccer team embarked on a trip that matches them with two other college teams on consecutive days. The “Cats” contested High Point College Wednesday afternoon in High Point and then proceeded to Charlottesville, Virginia, on Thursday to play the University of Virginia. Returning on Saturday morning, the team carried twelve men on the trip. With the return of only two lettermen, namely Preston and Oliver Rhea, the “booters” were at a loss at first, but with constant practice, the team has shown promising skill.

#### Lineup

The tentative starting lineup included the following men: Crawford Wheeler, Bob Abernathy alternating sides, and Rhea Preston in the fullback spot, Doug Swink, Preston Oliver, and Bob McMullen as halfbacks. At one wing position, we find Murdock McKeithen, with the other wing position still undecided at the time the paper went to print. Gene Linton and Don Holland play insides while Ralph Coonrad holds down the center position. Other members of the squad are the players, and changes in the lineup may be frequent.

#### JUNIOR FLANKMEN

Pat Williams and Dick O'Hair (above) have been consistent starters at the end positions for the Wildcats this year. Williams, whose strong point is pass receiving, has developed into a good defensive man also. O'Hair, who has been slowed up considerably by a sprained ankle recently, is a vicious tackling and blocking machine.

#### Frosh Meet Carolina Tomorrow Afternoon

As the current grid season approaches the halfway mark, Maryland and The Citadel, usually the doormats of the Southern Conference, are the loop’s sole remaining undefeated teams. The Wildkittens will meet what Carolina students claim is their best Tarbaby team in years on Richardson Field at three o'clock tomorrow afternoon.Week, the Varsity line, averaging slightly over 190 pounds, held the Varsity's North Carolina and William and Mary teams, both undefeated and untied aggregations, to a draw. The Frosh fullback was a standout. The Frosh teams boasted clean slates until they journeyed north last Saturday and paired off against Fordham and Harvard respectively. The Tar Heels and the Rams staged a bitterly contested scoreless deadlock, while W. and M. and the Crimson ended up in a 7-7 draw.

Duke, Tigers Slip
For the initial time in years, Duke and Clemson, traditional conference powerhouses, are near the bottom of the victory ladder. The Blue Devils were handed a 26-12 lacing by the Georgia Flight Cadets, their second successive loss. The Tigers likewise suffered their second reversal when Boston College gave them a 14-7 pasting.

Terps Strong
Maryland’s Terrapins, sporting their T-formation, chalked up their third win of the campaign by rolling over Rutgers 27-13. The Citadel was impressive in downing George Washington 14-2 in a loop fray, while Jolting Joe Muha gave a scintillating performance in Charlottesville as he sparked the V.M.I Cadets to a 38-18 triumph over the weak Virginia Cavaliers. The Wolfpack of N. C. State, with only a tie with Davidson’s Wildcats marring an otherwise perfect record, fell to the Pre gridders, 19-7, in Raleigh under the lights of Riddick Stadium. Although State held a 7-6 margin at halftime, the Chapel Hill lads rallied to tally two scores and sew up the game in the last half.

Highlighting Saturday's gridiron docket are the Maryland-V.M.I, Duke-Colgate, V.P.I.-Kentucky, and the Wake Forest-N. C. State tilts.

Another activity impossible to uncover is the top. Tomorrow's game will be the season's opener for the yearlings.

Outstanding Backs
In their opening game of the season last week, the Wildkittens had an easy time downing a listless P.J.C. aggregation. Gaynn Fletcher, last-stepping tailback from Barium, and Roland Paylor, who showed plenty of drive, were standouts in the Davidson backfield. This is the first time in several years that Davidson's Frosh have played a Southern Conference team. The Kittens also have games scheduled with South Carolina and North Carolina State Frosh.

WITH THE STAFF
(Continued from Page 2)
Class officers are elected for a purpose, that is to lead and carry out the activities within and among classes. The intramural program is fine, but those who play are usually fraternity men. A class taking the cellar position in the interclass sport league might be the party in front of Chambers, if the weather permitted. Also, we might have a competitive class stunt night. This column challenges the class officers to take such a step. This might be a hard program to develop, but no one will be blamed for making an honest effort for a good cause.

GET THAT TOUCHDOWN!

Kittens Down P.J.C. 47 to 6
Frosh Roll To Easy Win Over Weak Opponents
Davidson's Wildkittens opened their '42 grid season with an easy win over P.J.C. by the score of 47-6. In the first quarter, Fletcher returned a short P.J.C. punt 12 yards to the P.J.C. 32. The Kittens drove the ball to the 4 with Paylor and Fletcher carrying the ball, then Fletcher went over tackle for the first touchdown. Fletcher set up the second touchdown in the second quarter with a 35-yard run to the P.J.C. 25 where he stepped out of bounds. Fletcher then passed to White for the second touchdown. The Kittens scored again when P.J.C. fumbled the kickoff and Davidson recovered on the 9. Fletcher went over on the next play and the Wildkittens led at the half, 19-0.

Fletcher and Paylor collaborated on the fourth touchdown drive with Fletcher scoring from the seven. Paylor scored the next touchdown on a line buck off tackle for 27 yards. Coach Shepard sent in his second team in the last quarter. Troutman intercepted a pass and ran 45 yards for the sixth score. Troutman placed the ball in scoring position with a beautiful 40-yard run to the P.J.C. 9. Kaw went in for Troutman, who was hurt on the play, and scored the Kittens' last touchdown. Phillips place-kicked the extra point to make five out of seven tries during the game. P.J.C. scored their lone tally in the last quarter.

Wildcats, With New Spirit, Tackle Tech
Davidson Faces Conquerors of Notre Dame in Atlanta Saturday
Wildcats, humbled thrice but determined to salvage all possible glory from their remaining battles, entrain tomorrow to face one of the nation’s mightiest grid aggregations. Atlanta is their destination and Georgia Tech, their foe. Bill Alexander's Engineers hold victories over Notre Dame, Auburn, and more recently a smashing triumph over Chattanooga U. The Wildcats' unimpressive loss last week to V.P.I. coupled with Duke defeats, make the locals decided underdogs.

Few Injuries
However, with the exception of Mac Bruce, whose knee may keep him out for the rest of the year, only minor bumps and bruises will prevent the fighting 'Cats from unleashing that spirit so sadly lacking in their last two tilts. Davidson is in good shape. Tech is powerful this year and has long been noted for its wizardry. Freshman Clint Castleberry and Sophomore Eddie Prokop give them added punch over a massive line. Williamson rates them in the top ten of the country. In the 'Cat camp, Gene McEver has been cooking up a little trickiness of his own, and students who brave the Georgia highways can be assured of a wide-open affair. Last week, before bowing to superior power, Chattanooga held Georgia Tech to a 13-7 lead at the half.

Probable Starters
With a wealth of material to draw from, the 'Cat starters at the flanks are uncertain; O’Hair, Peters, Peterson, and Dunn are fighting it out on even terms. Shaw and Rainey will probably get the nod at tackles, as will Taylor and Moore at guards. Red Burke will start at center. Art Roach, Ben Lacy, Bob Du Kant, and George Peters are the Wildcat hopes for rolling up the first Davidson score of the year. Against V.P.I., their much relied upon passing threat was impotent, garnering only a yard. It will be a different story against Tech, Davidson's hoping.

SOPHS WIN TITLE
The flashy Sophs passed their way to a 12-0 win over the powerful Seniors in the playoff for the interclass touch football championship last week. Wednesday afternoon, Sammy Yarborough at wingback, Charlie Wills in the passing position, and Jim Lowry on the receiving end sparked the underclassmen to their decisive win. Outstanding for the losers were Burkhead Walker, Ed Murray, Welford Hobbie, and Long John Belk. With the Seniors dropped into second place in the final standings, the Freshmen followed up in third place. The Juniors, who have yet to win their first game in this sport, wound up in the cellar. All-class selections have not been made as yet but will be announced in the near future.
