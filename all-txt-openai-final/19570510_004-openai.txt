**EXTRA SEMESTER FOR SICKNESS**

**Required Gym Class Due For Overhaul**

By BOB LATHAN and GEORGE RAMSEY

As Dr. Tom Scott brought out at the athletic banquet Monday night, May 6, Davidson prides itself on its athletic
program, ranging from intercollegiate athletics down through inter-fraternity competition to the physical education program. It is no secret, however, that
students are dissatisfied with several points in the latter. We therefore propose an examination of the present “P.T.” program, and
several changes to be effected therein.

**THE DAVIDSONIAN**

**DMS’S ON PARADE**

Distinguished Military Students shown above are marching during a regular ROTC drill. Earlier, they had received awards from Assistant Secretary
of the Army Hugh Milton II.

**GOOD POINTS**

As it now stands, the program has its good points. The two-year required program insures all students of receiving at
least some directed physical activity while in college, and, in some instances, initiates an interest in sports in which a
student may otherwise have never participated. On the other hand, there are situations which cry out for a change.

One of the major complaints on the part of the students is the required once-a-week swimming period, which was incorporated
into the program last year. The primary factor in making this activity so unpopular is the temperature of the water
in the pool. Particularly during the early morning periods, a dip in the cool waters of Johnston gym is an
uncomfortable experience. If the athletic department decides to include this activity in the schedule, with the intent of benefiting the
student, it should provide means of warming the pool. Granted that swimming is profitable, it seems that to indulge in
it during the autumn and spring days when outdoor recreation is possible is a mistake. Let’s save the pool for
rainy days and the winter months!

**FORCED PARTICIPATION**

Another on the list of grievances in the P.T. program is the forced participation in certain events. Once a student
finishes his push-ups on the parallel bars, running the obstacle course, and other events in the athletic ability test, he
is classified as a wrestler, a soccer player, a gymnast, or a trampolinist, and he has no choice. We would
propose a return to the practices of years past, with attractive presentation of the various sports and the opportunity for
the students to choose their activities.

As stated in the college catalogue, students who fail to pass the athletic achievement test are placed in the fundamentals
class for one term, and then join the normal program. It is the responsibility of the student to pass the
test by the end of his sophomore year, or continue in the program until he has done so.

**GREYHOUND**

We propose that this policy be changed so that students should be placed in a fundamentals class if they fail
the test at the beginning of their freshman year, and continue in this class throughout their freshman year until they
would be placed in the normal program. At the beginning of the sophomore year, students should be placed in the
normal program whether they have passed the test or not. If they have failed the test thus far, it seems
highly improbable that they will pass. This would also eliminate required P.T. for juniors and seniors who have not passed
the test. We also propose that the activities of the students in the fundamentals class be chosen individually so as
to develop the skills in which they proved weakest on the test.

**CUT POLICY**

The new cut policy, enforced last year because students were taking advantage of the infirmary sick list, is unfair to
students in that it calls for another term of P.T. if an excessive number of cuts is taken, regardless of
the reasons. A change should be made here, so that students who are physically incapacitated may be excused from the
class periods during which this condition prevails. Otherwise, the cut policy appears satisfactory.

The proposals made here are:
1. Conditions for swimming periods be improved.
2. Swimming be reserved for “indoor” weather.
3. Students be allowed a choice of sports after passing the ability test.
4. Students remain in fundamentals class during freshman year until test is passed. Required participation beyond this point be nullified
on basis of failure to pass the test.
5. Modification of cut policy to excuse sick students.

Confession! We'd like to admit right here and now that the main reason we run advertisements like this is to
get you, dear reader, to drink Coca-Cola to the virtual exclusion of all other beverages. The sooner you start going
along with us, the sooner we'll both begin to get more out of life.
