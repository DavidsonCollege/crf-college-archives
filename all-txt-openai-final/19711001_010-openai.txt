Committee Begins Study On Danger Of Water Beds
By JOHN KEPCHAR, Staff Writer

For those students who can't keep from tossing and turning all night unless they are sleeping on their water bed, structural weaknesses in the dormitories may prevent their sound sleep.

"No further water beds will be allowed on campus until a special study has been completed," said Mrs. Scotty Nicholls, Director of Student Housing.

Students presently using water beds on campus may continue to use them until a final decision has been reached after the study results are in. "The answer will come in a few weeks," said Mr. Grover Meetz, Director of the Physical Plant. "A committee will investigate the effects of the added weight on the dormitories, and also consider the results of a possible leak," Meetz said.

Many people have pointed out that things could be rather miserable with more than 300 gallons of water dripping through the ceiling. The committee will probably be composed of Meetz, Nicholls, and Dean of Students Will H. Terry, Meetz said.

Changes
By DOUG BROWN, Asst. Managing Editor

The Office of Admissions and Financial Aid has compiled some preliminary statistics on the Class of 1975. College board scores are down from last year’s freshman class. The Class of 1974 had an average verbal score of 600 as opposed to this year’s average of 593. The average math score for last year's freshman class was 644 and this year it is 639.

The Class of 1974 had combined college board scores of 1244, which gave it the highest average college board scores in the history of Davidson. By another criterion, this year's freshman class did as well as last year’s. The per-Percentage of those ranking in the top fifth of their class for both classes is 86. Director of Admissions and Financial Aid H. Edmunds White commented, “The 86% figure for this year's freshman class is a shade more impressive than last year's because of the increase in the enrollment of private school graduates.” These graduates tend to come from schools more competitive than public ones. The number of private school-educated freshmen increased dramatically over last year. Fifty-three are in the Class of 1975, and their percentage is 17%, as opposed to 8% last year, which had been the recent trend. Members of the Office of Admissions will be visiting additional private secondary schools this year. White said, "We will probably see an increasing number of students entering Davidson from private schools. Those parents who have sent their sons to private secondary schools are more likely to send them to private colleges such as Davidson.”

Those scoring a 3, 4, or 5 on the Advanced Placement Examinations showed an increase in this year's freshman class. In the Class of 1975, sixty-eight did this as compared to sixty-five in the Class of 1974. This probably reflects the increased number of preparatory school students, as private schools tend to emphasize the Advanced Placement Exams more than public schools. Ten percent of those accepted for the Class of 1975 and needing financial assistance did not receive financial aid equal to need. In the future, those receiving financial aid will have to rely on substantial self-help in the form of jobs and loans. “We were unable to supply aid equal to need to all members of this year’s freshman class, and those who decided to come despite this fact had to rely entirely on self-help,” said White.

Private institutions such as Davidson are tending more to attract students from the higher and lower income brackets. With rising costs and present financial aid policies, the middle class is finding it more and more difficult to afford a private college education. As in the past, the great majority of freshmen tend to come from North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, and Florida. This trend will probably continue, although certain sections of the country will receive new emphasis by the Office of Admissions. For example, the time spent by a representative of the Office of Admissions in New York City will double this year.

Davidson has instituted a new policy in regard to athletic grants. When a student voluntarily ceases to participate in a sport for which he received a scholarship, Davidson will have the authority to reduce or eliminate his scholarship. For 1971-72, the amount needed to finance the football scholarship program is about $170,000. Also, Davidson is committed to maintaining a superior basketball program, and this is reflected in the fact that the most number of scholarships Coach Driesell had was sixteen. However, Coach Holland now has eighteen. According to the college, more money is being expended for basketball than at any other time.
