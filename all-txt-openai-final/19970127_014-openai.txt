JOHNSON CITY, Tenn. -
Freshman guard Jennifer
O’Brien was a three-time All-
state selection and State Player-

Notebook

of-the-Year last season in Con-

necticut, a women’s basketball

hotbed.
She is used to making good
things happen on the hardcourt
and being able to elevate her game
- and dominate at a game’s most

crucial moments.

And after a very brief transi-
tional period from high school to
college, the 5-5 O’Brien is starting
to assert her
talent at
Davidson.

Since
making her
first career
start two
weeks ago in
the confer-
ence opener at
Western
Carolina, she has averaged 9.5
points, 4.3 assists, 3.7 rebounds, and
24.5 minutes per game.

She hit double figures in points
in three of those six games, including

Hot-shooting Bucs
knock off Wildcats

By AARON DUNHAM

JOHNSON CITY, Tenn.,
Jan. 25 - One major step forward
and two small steps back.

And despite scoring only four
points in the UT-Chattanooga
thriller, she fed Jamie Brown for
the game-tying baseline jumper
with four seconds left and then
stole the ensuing inbounds pass
and again found Brown for an im-
probable buzzer-beating, game-
winning lay-in.

Road Warriors

Tonight’s game against
Marshall in Huntington, W.Va.,
marks the second of three straight
road contests for the Wildcats and
the end of one of their longest road
jaunts of the season.

The team bused to East Tenn.
St. following Friday’s practice,
played the Bucs Saturday after-
noon, spent their second night in
Johnson City, then headed to
Marshall yesterday.

The Wildcats conclude the

grueling stretch Saturday vs.

Furman in Greenville, S.C. They
next play in Belk Arena a week
from tonight in the back end of a
home-and-home with the Paladins.

Coming On Strong

Entering Saturday’s game, the
Wildcats had shot better in the
second half than the first half in all

76-65 loss Saturday at East Tenn.

St.

The Wildcats (11-5, 3-2) were
plagued by miserable shooting (23-
for-82, 28%) and the inability to
convert 19 ETSU turnovers into
points.

The Bucs (9-9, 2-4), in turn,
were able to make the most of
many wide-open scoring opportu-
nities, shooting a season-high 53%
in the first half on their way to a 41-
30 intermission lead.

Davidson came out much
more aggressive in the opening
minutes of the second half, but
could never trim the lead to under
eight.

“The most frustrating part is
that we tried two or three different
defenses and we’re not playing
any of them really well right now,”
said a disappointed and frustrated
coach John Filar.

ETSU stifled Davidson with a
densely-packed zone, almost dar-
ing the struggling Wildcats to fire
from the perimeter.

The plan worked to perfec-
tion, as the Wildcat deep threats hit
only 26% of their three-pointers
and the Bucs held Carolyn Kirsch
to a season-low eight points and
center Jennie Vanlerberghe to just
four.

“We knew one of their weak-
nesses was their outside shooting
and we wanted to keep them out of
the paint,” explained ETSU coach
Karen Kemp, whose squad
bounced back remarkably from an
ugly 31-point loss last week at
App. St.

Both teams were without the
services of key players. The Wild-
cats continue to play without start-
ers Kerry Brown and Jessica
Montrella, both out with mono-
nucleosis. And the Bucs were mi-
nus leading scorer Rachel Glass
(knee) and guard Christina Ervin
(toe).

Adrianna Wilson paced the
Bucs with a season-high 19 points
and Heather Edmondson added 14,
including four threes.

Davidson got strong bench
play from Katy Kamp, who notched
a career-best 14 points. Overall,
Davidson’s subs outscored the
starters, 33-32.
