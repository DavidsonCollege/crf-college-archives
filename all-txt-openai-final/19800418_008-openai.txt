Jerry Rubin at CPCC

Jerry Rubin, one of the leading personalities in the movement against America’s War in Southeast Asia, will speak at Central Piedmont Community College (CPCC) in Charlotte Tuesday, April 22, 1980, at 8:00 p.m.

Rubin, now 41, co-founded the Youth International Party (also known as yippies) and, as a member of the Chicago 7, was on trial for 5 1/2 months in a courtroom performance that attracted national attention, for charges of conspiracy in organizing the demonstrations against the Democratic National Convention during August, 1968.

Currently, Rubin describes himself as a “rank and file” member of the anti-nuclear movement.

Considered one of the most dynamic speakers on the college lecture circuit, Rubin has left audiences spellbound with his descriptions of his adventures during the 1960s, the consciousness-raising movements of the 70s, and his speculative projections into the 80s.

General admission is $3.00, and student admission is $2.50. Call 373-6512 for more information.

The college music department has two student performances planned for this week. On Monday, April 21, Senior Randolph Hutter will give a trumpet recital in Love Auditorium at 8:15 p.m. Then the Davidson College Flute Ensemble will perform in the 900 Room Tuesday, April 22 at 9:00 p.m.
