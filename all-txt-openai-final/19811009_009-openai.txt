### Soccer Splits Pair

**Fans not shy about giving oral encouragement**

by Mark Elmore ‘82

Have you ever wondered why the athletes always get quoted and never the fans? Well, I tried quoting a few
fans this week and it doesn’t work very well; they never seem to say nice things about the other teams,
and I could not verbally bludgeon our opponents in the Davidsonian. So, I decided to be equitable and include a
few select comments made by students.

“How ’bout them dogs!” yelled someone.

Yes, several dogs did interrupt game-play but screw the dogs. “How ’bout them Cats!” We beat the tar out of
Washington & Lee and played the best game of the season.

Davidson was tenacious. After Washington & Lee scored first on a miskicked ball, freshman John Woodmancy quickly countered with a
chip from 25 yards that dipped over their keeper and tied the game 1—1.

This goal frustrated the Generals and the game became very physical and aggressive. “I didn’t like the boy who let
his frustrations out by showing everyone in the crowd his middle finger,” complained a prudish freshman co-ed, “But at least
I couldn’t hear their bad language.”

Though the match remained brutal, Davidson was able to remain patient with their passing and score two more goals. The
team’s strategy was to keep from forcing the ball into the middle; by keeping the wings wide and spreading the
Generals out, they created more open space for give-and-go passes and set up more shots on goal.

Chris Roberts scored the second Davidson goal from about 10 yards out and Todd Lambert followed with a beautiful turn
and volley in the game’s waning minutes.

With each fan shouting his own idea of, “serves you right, Generals, for playing so rough” (of course, nobody shouted
anything close to that), the Cats ended the game by merrily jumping about in the presence of the team they
wanted to beat so badly.

### Loss to Winthrop

On Tuesday Davidson hosted NAIA eleventh-ranked Winthrop, who scored just 30 seconds into the game — I hadn’t arrived there
yet so there will be no description. Other than scoring this goal, Winthrop failed to do anything but get beat
to the ball by the Cats.

Coach Slagle instructed the team to mark men very closely since he anticipated a tight passing game. Davidson covered their
men well, and in fact stole most passes intended for Winthrop players. “With Winthrop playing a sloppy, sloppy game, we
could string together 6 to 8 consecutive passes,” stated goalie Mike Iordanou. “We just couldn’t find the net.”

Agreeably, the offense should have scored and Davidson should have won since they outshot the Eagles 27—10. Also, Winthrop’s second
goal came from a penalty kick when their forward smashed into “The Greek’s” knee and a foul was called. “Greek”
called Milaka. A second Eagle went cage-crashing, but this time the joke was on him as he was given a
red card and ejected from the game. That left Winthrop having to play a man-down for most of the second
half.

The advantage showed for Davidson as it seemed like a rubber wall invisibly stood at half-field, for everything the Eagles
tried to boot into Wildcat territory immediately returned. They must have been enervated by our play because their entire team
was back on defense — something nationally-ranked teams do not usually do against us!

The team’s overall record came to 6—5 (1—2 in the Southern Conference), but that will be put to the test
in the next week as the team plays three games on the road. Tuesday the Cat kickers travel to UT-C,
and Sunday they’ll play Covenant (Lord knows where that is). The final game will be played in Charleston, S.C., as
The Citadel plays host to the Wildcats.
