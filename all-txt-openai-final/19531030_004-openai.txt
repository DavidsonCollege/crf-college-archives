**Cash, 7000 Miles From Homeland, Adjusts Well To Campus Weekends**

Let no sympathetic tear be shed for the Davidsonian pining for the girl back home in far away Mt. Mourne—at
least, not without first considering the case of our amiable South American student, Senor Adolph Caravia Cash of Uruguay. His
thoughts are turning these moonlit nights to a young lass named Rachel—his bride of scarcely a year—whom he left behind
some seven thousand miles! Not wishing to prolong any longer than necessary the application of the weathered adage, “Distance makes
the heart, etc.,” Adolph plans to have his wife join him in this country as soon as she completes her
library technician’s training in Montevideo and can find work in an American school. Until then, however, he is cheerfully occupying
himself with his studies at DC, and is rapidly finding a place for himself in the life of the campus.

The twenty-seven-year-old architectural aspirant comes to our college under the joint sponsorship of the Charlotte Rotary Club and the Boys’
Choir of Charlotte, in a program to bring the youth of our two republics closer together. Although Davidson is hardly
the place to study architecture, he says the mere opportunity of going to school in the United States was too
good to pass up. Moreover, even the casual observer readily sees that our poly-linguistic Spaniard likes education for its own
sake, and will benefit greatly from any field of study to which he sets himself.

Adjusting himself to his new life has been made comparatively easy through his excellent command of the English language and
by virtue of the remarkable similarity between the Carolinas and his native Uruguay. This latter fact should cause no end
of amazement to the average American citizen, who is notoriously ignorant of the way of life of his southern neighbors,
and who, disregarding the tremendous variety in the climate and topography of the South American continent, is prone to think
of her in terms of tropical jungles, uncivilized Indians, coffee beans, craggy mountains, and bi-monthly revolutions.

The American visitor to Uruguay would doubtless be agreeably surprised to find in her broad Atlantic resort beaches, the gently
rolling grasslands, the textile mills and tobacco barns, and her stable, democratic government, a country and people not unlike those
of our own Carolinas. Adolph’s hometown, Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay, is situated on the Atlantic coast almost exactly the
same distance from the equator as Spartanburg, and enjoys a climate similar to that of Wilmington.

Uruguay is the smallest of the South American republics, but it is by no means least in the field of
social legislation and democratic freedom. Her government, one of the most stable in Latin America since the turn of the
century, is organized after the pattern of the United States, with the exception that the executive power is in the
hands of a council rather than one man. Although lying in the shadow of Argentina, she seems in no way
intimidated by the specter of Juan Peron as she leads the fight for a free press and personal liberty. Uruguayans
rank first on the continent in religious toleration, in social rights and privileges, and in free, secular education. Her extremely
low illiteracy rate attests to the success of the latter, through which a student may receive without costs all twenty-two
years necessary for a degree.

In leaving his country to come to Davidson, one of the only real adjustments Adolph has had to make is
in regard to his name. Although he is known on the campus as Adolph Cash, or more often simply as
“Cash,” his last name is merely the family name of his mother, an Englishwoman, and is more comparable to our
middle name. At home he would be referred to as Senor Caravia, the family name inherited from his Spanish father,
a prominent architect in Montevideo. In addition to this change, he is having trouble remembering that October means autumn, since
the countryside of Uruguay is experiencing the colorful return of Spring.

In discussing the various aspects of his new environment, Cash was quick to say that he enjoys our brand of
football, but his smiling eyes were unable to hide his disappointment at not finding a soccer team at Davidson. Uruguayans,
like most South Americans, are avid sports fans, and play their national game with so much zest and fervor that
referees are substituted much more frequently than players. After soccer, basketball ranks highest in popularity, and his tiny country has
always been a fierce opponent of its larger neighbors, Brazil and Argentina, as well as nations the world over, winning
its last International Basketball Championship only three years ago. But whether discussing sports or politics, Adolph displays such courtesy, such
ease and intelligence in conversation, and such a friendly attitude toward his listeners, that he appears to be living proof
of the values of our exchange program.

Dan Leach and Ish Bennett combined efforts to give the Phi Delts a victory over the strong Kappa Sig team.
Eddie Poe’s passing was the main threat as the Kappa Sigs fought vainly to keep their record clean.

**Sigma Chis 39, ATO 13**

The fast Sigma Chi team rolled to another victory as they scraped the ATOs by the score of 39 to
13. Ray Harding, basketball standout, showed his power on the gridiron with his passing and running sparking the team. Charles
Efird led the ATOs.

in class (upper half of the males in the sophomore class or upper three fourths of the males in the
junior class). Students accepted for admission or attending a graduate school prior to July 1, 1951, satisfy the criteria if
their work continues to be satisfactory. Graduate students admitted or attending after July 1, 1951, must have been in the
upper half of their classes during their senior year or make a score of 75 or better on the test.
It is not mandatory for local boards to defer students who meet the criteria. General Hershey has emphasized many times
that the criteria are a flexible yardstick used to guide the local board and that the standards may be raised
any time necessity for manpower demands.

The two forthcoming administrations of the College Qualification Test represent the fourth series of tests in the program. The November
19 test will raise the total number tested since May 26, 1951, to a little more than 500,000 men.

During the second hour of drill next Tuesday, Scabbard and Blade will hold a tapping ceremony. This ceremony is under

**Freshmen Group**

A discussion group for freshmen only will meet in the Student Lounge of the church on Tuesday evening. The theme
will be “Christianity and Davidson,” and Christianity as it relates to the honor system and other Davidson features will be
discussed. Discussions will be led...by Professor Wilson, Professor Baumann, Leighton McCutchen, and Mike York. This is the first time that
such an all-freshman discussion meeting has been held, and it is hoped that it will lead to other freshman discussion
groups in the future. Dr. Docherty will be available for personal conferences at the Guest House from 2 to 3
o'clock Monday and Tuesday afternoons. Students who desire such a conference should make an appointment through the YMCA office.

Docherty Scotch

Dr. Docherty was born in Glasgow, Scotland, and received his early education in the Glasgow public schools. He received his
M.A. from the University of Glasgow in 1935 and his B.D. from Trinity College in 1938. The Doctor of Divinity
degree was conferred by Temple University of Philadelphia in 1950. From 1939 to 1944 he was minister at Sandyhills Church
of Scotland. From 1944 to 1947 he distinguished himself as minister-coadjutor at Barony of Glasgow, where special work was done
among young people under the auspices of the Iona Youth Trust, working along the principles of the Iona community. Dr.
Docherty served as minister at North Church, Aberdeen, during the years 1947-1950. Then he was called to Washington, D.C., where
he has served with distinction as the minister of the New York Avenue Presbyterian Church. This church is known as
the “Church of the Presidents,” and Dr. Docherty is the successor of the late Dr. Peter Marshall. He delivered the
Ashlin White Bible Lectures at the First Presbyterian Church of Mooresville last year, and while he was in North Carolina
he spoke to the Davidson students in chapel.

However, Johnny has been plagued with one injury after another until Saturday's leg injury spelled “finis” for his football career.
He suffered a shoulder separation last year in the Richmond game which ended his 1952 action.

Cool Performer

Gray has proved himself one of the coolest quarterbacks in the business and was really a smooth operator in the
games this year which saw him in top form. He'll be sorely missed in the remaining games. Thus, we offer
this final tribute to one of Davidson's finest—Johnny Gray.

Docket For Court Settles Down: 13 Face Tribunal Last Monday

The docket for the Freshman Court of Control has settled down somewhat since the first session. Thirteen boys were hailed
before the tribunal in the green room of the Student Union Monday night. All were found guilty except two. Warner
Hall was charged with making slighting remarks to upperclassmen, being cocky, and having a superior attitude and a nasty disposition.
Bob Moffett was brought before the court for general obnoxiousness, having a cocky attitude, repeatedly showing disrespect to upperclassmen, and
having a superiority complex, and not wearing his prescribed freshman hat. John Edwards was charged with showing conduct unbecoming a
Davidson gentleman, and especially a freshman. Bill Shuford and Randy Johnston were hailed before the court for failure to wear
their freshman beanies. Bill Gramley was tried for failure to wave his hat at a pep rally, poor spirit, and
little participation in said pep rally. He was found not guilty. Richard James was brought before the court for failure
to adhere to the orders set down by the court in a previous trial, by not wearing placards when told
to do so. He was also said to have a cocky attitude, and was seen without his nametag. Guy Hunt
was charged with getting out of his chapel seat with a contemptuous grin, before all upperclassmen had cleared the room.
He was found to be not guilty. Snyder Garrison, Sonny Kincey, Dan Haley, and Buster Jenkins were brought before the
court for not wearing their nametags during homecoming weekend. Bill Currie was charged with not knowing the freshman rules and
regulations, constant refusal to go to the stud, using language unbecoming a Davidson gentleman, having a high school attitude, and
being generally obnoxious. The penalties dealt out by the court for the various offenses, taking into consideration their severity, had
a wide range. A great number of the offenders were appointed as stud boys for various dorms and fraternity houses;
some were to clean football shoes; newspaper folding was also one of the penalties prescribed. Some of the boys were
to wear a red ribbon attached from their hat to the belt, as a reminder to always keep the hat
on; another punishment issued from the court was the wearing of a placard on the front and the back, as
a reminder to upperclassmen to ask the offender certain questions.
