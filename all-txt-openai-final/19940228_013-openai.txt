THE DAVIDSONIAN ARTS & LIVING MONDAY, FEBRUARY 21, 1994 13

HELLCATS in the 900 Room
By Tom Mew

Anyone not present in the 900 Room Monday night (and judging from the size of the crowd, that was just
about everyone on campus) missed a musical treat. The featured band, the Hellcats, played a strong set of both original
music and cover tunes. The band is from Mt. Holly and was formed in 1991 under the leadership of David
Childers. Childers, who handles vocal and rhythm guitar duties and is the band’s chief songwriter, has an extensive background in
poetry and creative writing and has had several works published.

The band performed a fine set of original and cover tunes, which reflected their eclectic background of influences. They appeared
well-versed in a number of styles including folk, rock, and jazz. Notable covers included a strong rendition of Howlin Wolf’s
“The Killing Floor” and an absolutely stellar version of Richard Thompson’s “Vincent ’52.” Standout originals included “Beatrice in the Bushes,”
a driving rock song in the style of Creedence Clearwater Revival, and “Trailer Park Woman,” in which lead guitarist Irwin
Bostion displayed some nice Chuck Berry-esque licks.

Bostion was the standout of the evening and displayed a mastery of several different styles of playing, including traditional rock
and blues and more country-oriented fingerstyle performance. Also impressive was bassist Tim Conard, a thoroughly professional player whose solid performance
anchored the band’s sound. Flute and saxophone player Aaron Stevenson added some tasteful embellishments, particularly on such numbers as “Vampire
Blues.”

The band was relaxed and friendly and appeared unhampered by the small crowd. Musically, they played a very tight set
with just enough rough edges to keep things fun. Childers, in particular, seemed quite at ease on stage and provided
an enjoyable feeling of spontaneity. The band has already released two tapes and is currently working on a CD which
should be released sometime this summer. Anyone searching for melodic rock and blues with clever and insightful lyrics should definitely
check out the Hellcats.

Will Reality Bites lose its meaning over time?
Reality continued from page 12

much better—and her touching performance here completely redeems her nauseating turn in Bram Stoker’s Dracula. Hawke, who showed us such
beautiful corpses in Dead Poets Society and Alive, gives a performance full of so much energy and feeling that you
probably won’t recognize him. Stiller, as Michael, is charming and attractive, but the true gem in the film is Garofalo,
who presents Vickie as a quick-witted, sarcastic wag, while never fully concealing her heart.

The film boasts pleasing performances from Swoosie Kurtz, Joe Don Baker, and John Mahoney (especially Kurtz, as Lelaina’s out-of-touch mother),
and also cameos by David Pirner of Soul Asylum, Duff from MTV, the Lemonheads’ Evan Dando, and a Cindy Crawford
spoof from The Firm’s Jeanne Tripplehorn.

Near the end of the picture, Michael and Troy are standing in the rain outside of a Houston bar, and
Michael is explaining why he has more to offer Lelaina than Troy could ever hope to offer. He compares Troy
to a court jester (in an obvious reference to Hamlet), and says, “...people will pick up his skull and say,
‘I knew this guy! He was really...funny.’ And that’s it.”

I can’t help imagining Reality Bites as the jester. It is the only thing that worries me about this film—is
it so geared toward our generation that it will lose its significance over time? I hope not. Reality Bites is
a credulous showcase of dilemmas that, despite the references to Peter Frampton and Melrose Place, are universal. But it is
also more than that; it is a remarkably honest portrayal of people our age who must go out and, as
Lelaina’s father says, “show some ingenuity,” while dealing with the evolution of relationships that is part of adulthood.
