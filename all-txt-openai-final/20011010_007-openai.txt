Tue Davidsonian _ Financial aid policy needs revision. The purpose of financial aid, first and foremost, should be to minimize the financial burden of paying for college. Yet today, many schools use financial aid as a tool to increase diversity and attract higher qualified applicants. In theory, there is nothing wrong with using financial aid for these purposes. Only when these ulterior motives get in the way of the primary purpose of financial aid does it become necessary to re-evaluate how we distribute the limited funds we have available. Davidson’s administration believes that financial aid is among the best ways to increase diversity. The current capital campaign, called “Let Learning be Cherished,” states, “To provide opportunity to the most promising students, whatever their financial resources, and to increase ethnic and cultural diversity will require a significant increase in financial aid endowment,” and sets aside a total of $85,000,000 for scholarship funding. The problem with this proposal is not its goal of using aid to increase diversity (a goal which should be commended). The problem is that nearly 25 percent of the total money devoted to aid will be merit-based, rather than need-based. While need-based aid is determined solely by one’s financial need, merit-based aid does not take one’s family financial situation into account. Merit aid could just as easily be awarded to the child of a millionaire as it could to an underprivileged student who truly needs the money. Many colleges have found that merit-based aid is unfair and does not accomplish the true goal of financial aid: allowing anyone, regardless of means, to attend a given college. All of the Ivy League schools, as well as many competitive liberal arts colleges with which Davidson competes for students, such as Williams, Middlebury, and Colgate, award only need-based financial aid. These institutions reason that if they allotted money to merit-based aid, they could be taking away much-needed funds for those students who truly need the money the most. Some might argue that merit-based aid can increase diversity through scholarships specifically designated for minority students. Yet such scholarships present a very narrow view of diversity by only emphasizing very specific factors. Just because an applicant is a minority does not necessarily mean they are financially in need. These minority scholarships fail to recognize that diversity is about much more than just race. If the College wishes to truly accomplish its mission of using financial aid to create a more diverse campus, need-based, not merit-based aid is the solution. Not only does need-based aid provide money only to those who truly need it, but also, statistics show that the minority students Davidson seeks to enroll are more apt to be those who require need-based aid. By switching to an entirely need-based system, Davidson would be reaffirming its commitment to providing an education to any admitted applicant, regardless of financial situation, as well as increasing the racial and economic diversity of the campus.

Do we really need all this brick? The short-term frustration caused by all the current construction projects will certainly lead to long-term benefits for all at Davidson. But at present, it has certainly become a hindrance and an eyesore. Although most students appreciate the hard work of the construction workers, one aspect of the project has become more questioned and joked about over the last few weeks on campus: Why exactly do we need all those brick pathways? When I leave my room in Watts Hall to proceed to my classes in the Chambers Building each morning, I now have the option of taking four different routes along the brick pathways. Now that my side of the center path to Chambers has been divided up into numerous triangles, it appears that work has begun to replicate the design on the left side so that students at Cannon and Duke halls will have as many options as I do. On top of that, has anyone noticed the parallel brick pathways leading to the campus center from the back of Watts and Cannon? I’m still trying to figure out that strategy. Most students will agree that the brick pathways certainly look nicer than the old pavement. Not only will brick create a nicer look for the campus, but also water is less likely to run off into pools from bricks than it is from pavement. Considering these benefits, it only makes sense to replace the pavement with brick. But why create more paths than we had before? The zigzag paths leading to Chambers have almost created a maze of senseless bricking. I’ve seen so many new paths made that I could probably describe to you the entire process of creating one. Again, I do not want to sound ungrateful to the construction workers. Most of these pathways will become beneficial to the campus’ appearance overall. I’m only voicing a commonly held opinion that the number of bricks in front of Chambers and other spots on campus seem rather pointless. Perhaps the administration has made calculations of some sort which prove that the new paths will cut every student's number of steps in a day down by five or six. Or maybe the goal is to create a straight path leading from every building to another. Whatever the reasoning, many students will remain puzzled as the bricklaying continues.

Observations on the music scene For the last few years, many people, including myself, have been complaining about the lack of talent in the music industry. Although the trend seems to be changing with the rising popularity of groups such as Incubus, Lifehouse, and the return of everyone’s favorite band in middle school, Weezer, the music on the radio is still rather poor. To satisfy my appetite for music, I have been doing two things: searching for less well-known bands and looking for older albums of bands that have made it big. Even though I usually write on politics, I figured I would share some thoughts concerning current popular bands. Vertical Horizon: The quintessential sellout band, Vertical started out as two guys playing acoustic guitar and writing intense lyrics, performing in small venues before they decided to amp up and add percussion. Whether youliked their platinum-selling album *Everything You Want*, their albums *Running On Ice* and *There and Back Again* are indie alternative classics that everyone should own.

**Rockwell Church:** A talented duo in their 20s from the same mold as Vertical Horizon and Jackopierce, this group writes amazingly deep and complex lyrics combined with talented guitar and piano playing. The result is both beautiful ballads and soulful grooves. Any song from their first two albums *Through the Fall* or *Inches From the Ground* is a great way to get introduced to their music.

**Guster:** The band’s newest album, *Lost and Gone Forever*, achieved some popularity on college campuses, but most people have only heard a few of their songs. The albums *Parachute* and *Goldfly* sound more like Dispatch or Oar and the band does not sound as produced or polished as it does on its newest release. The result is a bit more of an edge. That edge combines with the strain and emotion that one can readily detect in all its vocals and music, making Guster a joy to listen to any time.

**Ben Folds Five:** Most people heard the group’s single “Brick.” A rather depressing song, “Brick” almost turned me off from Ben Folds Five because the radio stations (at least in my area) beat it to death by playing it once an hour, every hour, for two weeks. However, I managed to wade through that wave of over-popularity and I can still call them one of my favorite groups. If all you’ve heard is “Brick,” then you need to make some purchases (or downloads). Ben Folds’ beautiful piano playing combines with his lyrical talent to produce songs that can be hilariously ironic or that grab your emotions as the lyrics take you to any given emotional state Ben wants you to feel. The group recently split up, but Ben Folds released his new album this past month entitled *Rockin’ the Suburbs*. The title track is getting some deserved airplay, but there are some more somber songs, such as “Fred Jones Part 2” and “Still Fighting It,” that you should definitely check out.

**In response to “Moral leader, not Jackson needed for Taliban talks (Column, Oct. 3):** It seems to me that though I placed the article in the paper myself, and that Zach Williams is entitled to his opinion, his argument was inherently flawed. I tell you all, Jackson made a big mistake. Damaging to his character, I'll give you that. But to say that a mistake, no matter how big, that is not illegal, is unforgivable enough to wipe away a record of service, justice, and love is unbelievable. Jackson is a great choice for mediation. Who else can name someone so accomplished in that field? 

1984 — Jackson returns a US pilot from hostile Syria.  
1998 — Jackson meets with Serb President Milosevic and saves three more servicemen from a tyrannical regime. 

Let’s not forget his civil rights record. He is the leader of the Rainbow Coalition, an organization determined to preserve the rights of oppressed minorities. Is that not moral enough for you? He also served next to Martin Luther King to bring black Americans equal rights and was at his side when King was shot. Jackson is sorry. He knows he let a lot of people down. But I imagine it is not wise to keep a man so good at something so important down forever. But of all people, Jackson will not let any man keep him down.

**Sports show our true colors**

Over the past few years, ethics in American sports have been on the decline. Relations between athletes have exploded into violent confrontations. Officials have had to restrain parents for outbursts at Little League games. Even the average fans at professional games have to be monitored like rioters by police. In the midst of such foolishness, a terrorist attack shocked the nation. Leagues canceled games. Local gyms filled with relief supplies. ESPN broadcasted athletes talking about the tragedy. America stopped. We stopped yelling and cursing; we stopped hating the other team. For a brief moment in time, fans put allegiances aside and treated their opponents as fellow Americans.

Now, as the pace of athletics picks back up, many are asking what role sports should play during a time of national tragedy and war. At first, I thought that we would not lose much by canceling all games and focusing on the combat issues at hand. After all, if American soldiers were risking their lives in enemy territory, while others were screaming at players on a field, America would seem like a very disrespectful and shallow place. But when I turned the television back on, people were not yelling, and players were not fighting. Instead, fans were holding posters that read “God bless America” and athletes were playing with honor. “Hmmm,” I thought, “what a new approach.” When the violence is not our own, America chooses to react with love and dignity. We always knew that the Red Cross, United Way, and American citizens would band together to support the country. We’ve witnessed this phenomenon countless times before during hurricanes and floods. Who would have guessed, though, that an attack on our country could enhance and reveal our sportsmanship?

For now, America has returned to the athletic field, even as soldiers move to the battlefield. Our president encourages such normal activity and our nation needs the solidarity. As we move further away from the day of national tragedy, though, violence is creeping back into our games. If we have to lose one aspect of our culture in this war, we could rid ourselves of the way we are used to playing and participating in sports. Good sportsmanship and healthy competition could help unite a people at war. Regardless of the course of America’s retaliation, as a country we should be able to take pride in both the national anthem we sing and the way we behave after the game begins.
