Last Tuesday, the Davidson men’s soccer team rode onto the fields of The Citadel brandishing a double-edged sword—the dual honors of an eight-match reign over United States military schools and an unblemished record in Southern Conference play. With great skill and a quiet confidence, the Wildcats returned home with both streaks safely intact.

Stepping up once again to lead the ’Cats was senior tri-captain Chris Norbet, who netted two goals to boost his season total to 12. Entering the game, Norbet’s 1.11 goals per game placed him 10th nationally in that category, and his 2.67 points per game ranked him 5th in the nation. Maintaining this “torrid pace,” as head coach Matt Spear describes it, Norbet gave Davidson an early one-goal advantage, finding the back of the net in the 33rd minute off a pass from fellow captain Erik Ozimek.

Fiercely defending their home field, The Citadel responded in the 43rd minute, as Justin Davis notched only the 3rd goal for the Bulldogs all season. Ozimek scored the game-winner in the 72nd minute, when he fired home a pass from senior Paul Watson. Norbet secured the victory over the Bulldogs in the 90th minute, finishing a sharp pass from freshman Dan Ferriter to give Davidson a two-goal lead.

Freshman goalie Bart Creasman, filling in for junior Soren Johnson, who had an academic obligation, played solidly in his first collegiate start, recording two saves and earning the 3-1 victory. “The Citadel game was a big win for us, especially since we were missing three starters,” Spear commented. “Other players had to step up and get the job done. Ozimek played a fantastic game and it was nice to earn our second conference road win.”

The squad returned to friendly Smith Field in Richardson Stadium late Tuesday night to face the Mountaineers of Appalachian State. Davidson topped App State, 2-0. Davidson will now travel to Lexington, Va., Saturday to face Southern Conference foe VMI.

The Davidson men’s cross country team traveled to Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania this weekend to compete in the 28th annual Paul Short Run. Amidst cold, wet, and windy conditions, Penn State took the team championship, while Daniel Wilson from the University of Connecticut took the individual top honors with a time of 24:20. The Davidson men placed 24th of 39 teams in a field of 274 runners. Junior Brad Becken led the Red and Black through the cornfield-ridden course in 26:32 to place 107th on Lehigh’s 8K course.

In a significant Saturday performance, the Davidson women’s cross-country team breezed past the competition in the Citadel Invitational Cross Country Meet at James Island County Park in Charleston, S.C. Displaying the unity greatly responsible for the team’s success, the Wildcats ran as a pack throughout the race and finished together for a sweeping victory. Only eight seconds behind the overall winner, freshman Anna Brew placed second with a time of 19:18. Close behind were teammates Liz Gross (19:25), Laura Puckett, and Jenna Kruppa (19:29), who placed third, fourth, and fifth respectively.

**Women’s soccer fights “ups and downs”**

Penn Graves, senior captain for the Davidson Wildcats women’s soccer team (5-7), summed it up, saying, “It’s a lot of ups and downs.” The fourth-year defender could have just as easily been talking about last weekend as the entire season. After a disappointing end to a four-game winning streak, the Wildcats faced a tough match against Virginia Tech. Graves, reflecting on the game, said, “They were big, fast girls, but we really just didn’t play up to our potential.” The loss dropped the ’Cats to 4-7, improving the Hokies to 4-4-2.With a loss to Virginia Tech on Friday, the Wildcats responded on Sunday by trouncing The Citadel in a laugher, 12-1. After such a lopsided match, the team is more concerned with their 2-0 loss against VA Tech, their toughest competition in a few weeks. In one of the more notable “ups” of Friday’s overall “down” was continued solid play from freshman keeper Sarah Hobart. She faced 24 shots and recorded five saves. Hobart kept it close enough to say later, “It was 0-0 at the half, so it wasn’t really a blowout or anything.” The second-half goals came within a ten-minute window, from the foot of an unassisted Wendy Kotwas and a far-post blast from Carmen Chestnut. Graves, frustrated by an ankle injury in the first half, said resignedly, “We just didn’t come out as strong as we could have.” 

“We hadn’t seen that level of play in awhile,” said Graves. But the team isn’t pinning its loss solely on the sound play of the women from Virginia.

Chris Sally Stanhope finished with a time of 19:33, rounding out the Wildcats’ top five. Freshman Schmader ’04 edged under the 27-minute mark (26:46, 26:55, and 26:59.25, respectively), while Andrew Schoewe ’03 crossed the line at 27:11 to round out the ’Cats’ scoring five. “I can’t even think of the last time we’ve had a split like that—39 seconds [between the team’s first and fifth finishers]; it’s been a long time,” said head coach Gary Andrew of the lead pack of runners. “We continue to have a tight top five split, but we need to move that entire group up.” Sophomore Colby Broadwater and freshman Kevin Bell comprised the remaining competitors for Davidson in the 9:30 a.m. race, while sophomores Ben Gaspar and Greg Scott recorded performances in the ensuing open 8K race. The cross country team returns to action this Saturday in the pre-national meet at Furman University in Greenville, S.C.

The team’s top five scoring runners had a spread of only 15 seconds, owing to their pack mentality. Head coach Jennifer Straub and assistant coach Adam Johnson encouraged the team to run together and motivate one another throughout the race. This strategy proved successful for the 'Cats, who won the meet with the low score of 20 points against three other Division I teams, including the host Citadel (58 points), Georgia Southern (61 points), and South Carolina State (100 points). The women’s cross country team will race this weekend at the North Carolina Intercollegiate Championships in Greenville, N.C. in anticipation of their conference meet back in Charleston on October 27.

I’ve got to believe that those are the qualities that the youth should see and emulate.
