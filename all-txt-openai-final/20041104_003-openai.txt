#### Club baseball team funding leads to heated discussions

Thursday’s SGA meeting developed into a heated discussion over whether to allocate $1000 or more in funding for a new
club baseball team. Previous regulations placed a $250 cap on funding for first-year club teams. Davidson lacks an on-campus playing
field for a club baseball team, which felt it needs greater funding to provide for a field. The issue produced
a vigorous debate among SGA members.

“I feel like the issues at this week’s meeting were the most contentious of the year so far,” said Freshman
Senator Chris Catanese ’08.

According to Activities Tax Council bylaws, first-year organizations are able to receive a maximum allocation of $250. The $250 cap,
however, only applies to organizations that are directly funded by the ATC. “Because club baseball falls under the umbrella organization
of Club Sports they are currently part of a loophole to receive as much funding as the ATC and SGA
deem acceptable,” said ATC chair Adam Gerstenmier ’05.

The club baseball team requested extra funding to compensate for renting field space, league fees, uniforms, and equipment. “The controversy
for this arises out of the newly formed club baseball team’s request for about $3000,” said SGA President Katharine Hubbard
’05. “The amount is so high because there is not enough field space on campus, so they will have to
pay to use space off-campus.”

Supporters of the bill argued that acquiring an off-campus playing field demands extra resources. “Because the school does not have
a place for the club baseball team to play, the ATC should allocate funds up to $1000 to cover the
cost of renting field space elsewhere,” said Sophomore Senator Mac Skelton ’07.

Some SGA members wished to maintain the $250 cap on club sport allocations and feared raising the bar would undermine
current restrictions. “I’m not in favor of establishing a precedent that will promote club teams getting around the $250 limit,”
said Chairman of the Committee of Charter and Bylaws Darryl Ratcliff ’08. Ratcliff points to the club lacrosse team’s request
for excess of $250 last year. “Basically last year, they were in a similar scenario, they needed more than $250,”
he said, “and the senate voted to uphold the $250 limit.” Ratcliff points out that the refusal of extra funds
did not hurt the lacrosse team. “The moral of the story is that club lacrosse survived their first year and
got most of the money that they needed,” he said.

Supporters of extra funding for club baseball argue that the school’s inability to provide a field should allow for increased
financing. “The situation we have on our hands now is very different,” said Skelton. “I think SGA should vote to
grant first-year club sports up to $1000 over the traditional $250 if the school does not provide field space for
that particular sport.”

The Committee on Charter and Bylaws initially proposed that no amendment be made. The resolution, however, was struck down by
a roll-call vote. The Committee will present an amendment that deals with the issue in the upcoming meeting. The amendment
will propose allowing extra funding for club sport teams that lack proper field space.

As an opponent of the increased financing, Ratcliff’s position as chairman of the committee complicates the position. “We’re going to
meet and try to figure out if there is a way around this and see if we can make a
recommendation we can feel good about,” said Ratcliff. “Everyone wants [the Committee of Charter and Bylaws] to propose something because
it would add weight and legitimacy,” he added.

Despite controversy surrounding the baseball initiative, the SGA still managed to charter a chess club and schedule transportation by the
Vamanos Van for Tuesday’s election. “I am continually impressed by the amount that this group can accomplish with everyone taking
an initiative to get things done,” said Catanese.\ GRILLED CHEESE - i \ “Tike Soda itso VEGGIE MELT — -

because it seemed like a lot of intangible factors were favoring Kerry, but in the long term I wasn’t surprised
because people had been calling this a close election all along, and Bush always had a lot of advantages,” he
said. “The election was really Bush’s to lose.”

Perhaps the biggest surprises of the election came from the large number of Senate races that the Republicans won. “The
thing that surprised me most is that the Republicans increased their majority [in the Senate] so much,” said Sellers. “Few
had expected either side to run the table the way the Republicans did.”

Ansley was also taken by the number of Republican wins in the Senate. “I was especially disappointed with the Senate
races. I thought Bowles had a strong chance and I thought Castor would pull it out,” he said, referring to
Erskine Bowles and Betty Castor, both Democratic Senate candidates who lost their races in North Carolina and Florida respectively.

The most significant Senate win of the night for the Republicans was John Thune’s defeat of the Democratic Senate leader
Tom Daschle in South Dakota. Anne Pearlstein ’06, who has followed the South Dakota Senate race closely in one of
her political science courses said, “I was surprised by Thune’s victory. I know that Daschle had been the incumbent for
many years, and that for the most part was well liked.”

Virtually as soon as the final election results were reported, talk turned to what the outcomes would mean for the
future of both parties. “In the next couple of years Bush will push forward with radical programs,” said Ansley. “With
the Democrats I think there will be a lot of shaking up within the party. Our outlook needs to change
in how we look at issues, but in the end we will be stronger.”

Hubbard offered his own advice to the Democrats, saying “The [Democratic] Party needs to ponder its losses across the board
and realize that they need moderate southern leadership similar to Bill Clinton in order to be competitive again.”

Yet even with so many wins Tuesday night, there were some cautious words offered to the Republicans. “While Republicans have
a clear mandate,” said Sellers, “they have to be careful not to overreach since overreaching is what swept Bill Clinton
into a second term in 1996.”
