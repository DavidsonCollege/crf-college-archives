WITH OUR ALUMNI.

CLASS OF 1915.

In accordance with the lately established custom for the reunions of the alumni, there will be a reunion of the class of 1915 at the coming commencement. Since this is the youngest of the alumni classes, a special effort is being made to have all of the men of the class present. W. A. Dumas, '15, Davidson, N. C., is in charge of the arrangements, and the members of the class are requested to write to him for details.

RE-ELECTED TO SUPREME COURT.

Associate Justice T. B. Fraser, of Sumter, S. C., and a graduate of Davidson in the class of 1881, has been re-elected to the Supreme Court of South Carolina for a term of ten years.

EDMUNDS A CONTESTANT.

The National Institution for Moral Instruction is to give a prize of $5,000 for the best compilation of a code of morals for children. There have been designated, from the entire United States, only seventy men to compete for this prize. Superintendent of Schools S. H. Edmunds, of Sumter, S. C., of the class of 1890, has been appointed as one of the men eligible for this contest.

H. A. BANKS APPOINTED EDITOR.

The following item from the Charlotte (N. C.) Observer will be of interest:

“Readers of the Sunday School Times will be interested in the announcement that Mr. H. A. Banks, private secretary to Secretary of the Navy Daniels has succeeded Prof. Harlan P. Beach, of Yale University, as editor of its Missionary Watch Tower department. Mr. Banks was editor of the Evening Chronicle and then held responsible positions with the Observer and other publications. He is one of the best equipped newspaper men in the country.”

Mr. Banks was graduated from Davidson in the class of 1888.

NOTICE.

Both those who now hold positions as teachers and others who know of any vacancies are requested to write to Dr. J. M. McConnell, Davidson, N. C., and let him know of these vacancies so that he may be guided by them in the placing of the men who are looking for positions of this kind for the coming year. Any assistance that can be given along this line will be greatly appreciated.

EXHIBIT OF WAR POSTERS.

Prior to the adoption of conscription in England, the British government used large war posters as a means of procuring recruits. These posters were displayed on bulletin boards, in post offices and in other conspicuous places.

Mr. A. B. Weel, who gave a lecture in the college auditorium last fall on his experiences in the war, has sent a number of these posters to Dr. Fulton. Through the latter's kindness many of these are now on display in the library. They are printed in a variety of colors and designs so as to make a strong appeal to the fidelity and patriotism of English citizens.

HIGH SCHOOL LOSES DEBATE.

Upholding the negative of the query, “Resolved, That the United States should adopt the policy of greatly enlarging her navy,” represented by Howland and Person, defeated the local High School in the debate held in the Davidson school building on last Friday.

For Davidson, the affirmative was taken by Alexander and Johnson. The judges for the debate were Dr. Richards, Dr. J. M. Douglas and Dr. Arbuckle, of the college faculty. W. Y. Sayad presided.
