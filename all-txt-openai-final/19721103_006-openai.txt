**Novel By TOM BRUCE Contributing Editor**

The opportunity to study in a foreign setting while attending Davidson is being planned and packaged in a number of
novel ways. Davidson's standard Junior Year Abroad program was started in the early 1960s. Today, 14 students are studying at
the University of Montpellier in France, while 14 others are working at the University of Marburg in Germany. Besides these
well-known options, there are a number of planning-stage offerings, plus some other programs already in operation at Davidson.

The history and English departments offer courses at Saint Anne's College in Oxford, England under the advisorship of a Davidson
faculty member. The Classics department offers a seminar taught on location in Greece and Italy. Possibilities for the immediate future
include the expansion of the Junior Year Abroad program to include a year in India at the University of Baroda.
According to Paul Fisher, Director of International Education, “We are at a temporary impasse with the Baroda program. Every step
toward final approval of the program has been made. The Vice-Chancellor in India is quite keen on the program. We
don't want to be too traditionally oriented toward Western Europe. We are willing to negotiate programs in Africa, Japan, Latin
America, and in other places. Sometimes we tend to look farthest away when we talk about foreign study. We might
want to look into Mexico or Canada, since they are known to be worthwhile as well as accessible,” Fisher stated.

A study of urban civilizations abroad is also a possibility. This program would emphasize comparative aspects of development in cities
in Europe and the United States. The Religion department is seeking to investigate a short-term seminar in Israel that would
focus on the Christian tradition and cultures. Beyond this, students are planning semesters and years at schools where Davidson does
not offer programs. The African-American Institute in New York currently places students in various universities in Black Africa. It is
a non-profit organization specializing in Africa. African languages, social science, and natural sciences are offered.

At this point, the two programs in Europe, in France and Germany, are at a low point as far as
numbers of student participants. Fisher attributes this to routine changes in attitude from class to class. “Some of the students
seem caught up in isolationism. Many of them are quite career-minded and are trying to compile the best grades that
they can at Davidson, and they don't feel that this is possible through foreign study. Some of them don't feel
that they possess much linguistic ability,” Fisher said.

Certain academic majors are difficult to pursue in European universities. The French and German schools have limited laboratory resources and
they feel obligated to offer first dibs on them to their native students. Next in priority come students from developing
nations. Americans planning majors in pre-medicine, biology, physics, or chemistry probably cannot be accommodated. “Students at Davidson work around this
by planning their sophomore year schedules very carefully and even attending summer school in some cases. They use the credits
they earn in France and Germany to meet area requirements and to enrich their records,” Fisher remarked.

Some veterans of the Junior Year Abroad in past years have suggested that it be made a “sophomore year abroad”
so that students can devote their final two years to very close work with the Davidson faculty in their major
areas of study. “I can think of some good reasons to change it,” Fisher said. “From our point of view
at Davidson, it might be very valuable. The European universities want American transfers to have reached at least the junior
year, though. They feel that this gives them more equivalent experience to compete with French and German students. We are
making exceptions to handle seniors and students who have only one semester to study abroad, in some cases,” Fisher added.
“We want the programs to be flexible and, in some respects, custom-made.”

Davidson has no current plans to establish a Davidson campus permanently in some international setting. Some universities, such as Stanford,
have set up extension campuses in European cities. “The branch-campus format reduces the incentive to integrate into the foreign culture,”
Fisher explains. “Students congregate with other Americans and live...In a style essentially like the one to which they are accustomed
in the United States. "Under our system, the students 'go native,' mixing in with the local inhabitants and observing French
or German customs and lifestyles." Davidson might consider establishing a branch campus if short-term foreign studies became more popular. "This
might be feasible if the whole junior class intended to study abroad. They could go over with a minimum of
language preparation and then make learning the language and culture a main objective," Fisher re-emphasized. "We want to stay with
our current programs and at the same time broaden the various options so that more and more students will be
attracted to studying abroad."

Expense And Course Credit For Foreign Study Explained

By THOM NICOLL
Asst. Managing Editor

Director of International Education Paul Fisher last week explained the details on course credit and finances for the JYA programs
in France and Germany. Fisher said that up to this point, all who have requested credit for their courses taken
under the JYA program have received credit. He explained that all evaluation of the students’ work is now done here
at Davidson after they return in the fall. Fisher admitted, however, that the present system is awkward. "Of course, the
most logical person to evaluate a student's performance is the teacher," he said. However, because of their different structures, French
and German universities are not used to evaluating students on each course, Fisher explained.

According to Fisher, under the present system, after the student enrolls at Montpellier or Marburg, a letter is sent back
to Davidson listing the courses he is taking. The chairmen of the appropriate departments either make suggestions to the student
as to reading lists, papers, etc., which he should complete, or will place the resident advisor in charge of supervising
the student’s work. After the student returns, the departments decide whether or not to grant credit.

Because of educational reforms in France, Davidson students there may now become regular students rather than visitors. Lothar and others
hope that at least part of the evaluation may be done by the French professors.

Fisher broke down the JYA programs as follows: Costs for a comprehensive fee paid to Davidson, including insurance, eastbound travel,
three days in Paris, intensive language study, the advisor's expenses, and so forth, are $1,500 per semester. The cost per
month is $130 to $160, slightly more for the last month to cover return passage. The corresponding figures for Germany
are $130 to $160 per month. The total cost for Germany is higher because students stay there for 10 to
11 months, as opposed to eight and a half to nine months in France. "The amount we've suggested has always
been adequate, usually with some left over for travel," Fisher said. He pointed out that the total cost of either
program is close to the cost of a year at Davidson.

Financial Aid Director William Miller explained that as long as students attend a Davidson-sponsored program, their financial aid is figured
the same as though they were to stay at Davidson. If a student has a work-study job and goes with
the JYA program, we will either increase the loan part of his package to make up for the lost work-hours,
or, if he chooses, he can make up the hours after he returns," Miller said.

Senior Jimmy Edwards, who went to Montpellier last year, said he had complications over full credit. In one case, he
could not carry out his extended studies work successfully because the specified materials were not available. In another case, he
said that he and others had failed to get credit for an art course because the professor did not think
that they had done the proper amount or kind of traveling. Edwards said that he had written to Davidson about
these issues, but had received no satisfactory response.
