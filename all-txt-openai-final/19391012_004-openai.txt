Sideline Sidelines By ANDY DALE

Then came the rain! After a cool morning during which the sun played hide-and-seek with the clouds, the heavens burst wide open just at game time at Bluefield, and water poured down for over half of the game. Uniforms were soaked beyond belief, the ball was like a greased pig, the ground underfoot was covered with water and mud, and a sharp wind blew the rain right through spectators’ clothes. Under very adverse playing conditions, Davidson's light team bogged down, and V. M. I. did almost as bad, although their bigger linemen opened holes for those potting cadets to march through. Each time they got down in pay dirt, though, the ‘Cats dug in and threw them back, holding off any further score at that first safety.

Proclaimed far and wide as a team with a crack passing attack, the ‘Cats were never able to use their most formidable weapon, having to rely on straight football all the way. The few reverses tried failed gloomily. End runs and line plays were just as bad. With slippery footing underneath, Davidson's linemen were not able to move the Cadets with any ease. On the other hand, V. M. I. used her heavier line and backs to advantage on the sloppy field, piling up much more yardage from scrimmage—but never being able to get the oval across the zero stripe.

After the game, Coach Pooley Hubert of V. M. I. declared that the blocked kick which eventually proved the margin came as a complete surprise to him. Saying that no Davidson kicks had been blocked by State or Duke, he was (so he said) totally unprepared for that early score. All through the game, Sharpe had difficulty getting that slippery ball off, being rushed harder than ever after the safety, but did well considering the difficult conditions. Punt returns too were difficult, but V. M. I. safety men had better luck than Davidson. Every time that ball hit someone's arms it bounced up once or twice before being secured, and in several instances slipped out altogether. When punts fell to earth uncaught, they skidded like a rock skipped on water, and the safety men looked like dancers as they gingerly ran back to where the ball lay, stopped, then shoved off again on the slippery ground. When tackled, the runners made five more yards sometimes, if in the open, as they slid forward in the mud.

A big disadvantage to both teams was the fact that during the first half none of the men had on mud cleats, and both managerial staffs worked frantically during the intermission period and second half to change the spikes. Woe to Davidson if it rains another game! Always the lighter team is handicapped, and as Davidson’s main attack is through the air, they are hurt. We hope we've seen the last rainy Saturday for two months or so now, for with dry ground the ‘Cats will get a good chance to taste blood for the first time tomorrow against South Carolina at Sumter. But rain or shine, the ‘Cats made some real pay-dirt stands as they turned the V. M. I. attack again and again deep in their own territory on Saturday last.

UNC, Duke, Clemson In First Place

Duke, North Carolina, and Clemson have established themselves as top contenders for the Southern Conference crown this year by having defeated all conference foes to date and showing much power in outside games. 

For- instance, Wake Forest feels the blows dealt by the Tar Heels. Citadel, Vines, and V.P.I. were defeated in a hotly contested game 13-6. Duke, showing a world of power, has defeated N.C. State, and Virginia. They have four more conference games.

Duke defeated Colgate’s Red Raiders last weekend by the score of 37 to 0, establishing themselves as the conference's best, and also looking for national honors. The Blue Devils have one conference victory, having won over N.C. State in Charlotte last Saturday. Clemson has one victory, 25 to 6.

Above is Davidson’s reliable senior guard, Marvin Pennington. “Penny”, hailing from Jasper, Alabama, scales 187 pounds, and has been a standout in Coach Gene McEver’s forward wall since his sophomore year.

Statistics On VMI-Davidson

The Tigers showed their power the week before last in holding the Tulane Green Wave to a 7-6 victory. The V.M.I. Flying Squadron proved itself undeniably superior to Davidson's Wildcats in all departments of play Saturday as they cornered a lead in every division of the statistics. The Virginians pounded out nine first downs to Davidson's single first and ten.

Soccer Games To Begin Soon

Tommy Harnsberger, Captain-Manager of the Soccer Team, recently announced that the 1939 schedule for this newly recognized major sport is nearing completion. Six games have already been scheduled, while four more prospective contests may yet be added. “Home and home” game arrangements are listed with High Point, Duke, and Clemson.

The incomplete schedule is as follows:
Oct. 24—High Point
Nov. 3—Duke
Nov. 7—Duke
Nov. 17—High Point
Nov. 24—Clemson
Dec. 4—Clemson

Meanwhile, the squad of 24 has been hard at work getting into condition and drilling on the finer points. At present, they are trying to work out a cooperative forward line. Not only has soccer now become a major sport at Davidson, but it is also affiliated with the Intercollegiate Soccer Association.

V.M.I. Beats Cats 2-0 As Rain-Soaked Field Halts Both Offenses

Tipton Blocks Sharpe’s Punt In First Quarter To Pave Way For Flying Squadron’s Victory; Wet Field Stops ’Cats Aerial Show

By DAVID VOSBURGH

A blocked punt which rolled over the goal line and out of the end zone for an automatic safety, early in the first period, gave V.M.I. a 2-0 lead over the Davidson Wildcats last Saturday at Bluefield, West Virginia. Although this is the Freshmen’s first start, it is the third start for Wingate.

Wingate boasts of a heavy team this year, but Coach Little has confidence in his team and thinks they will make a good showing for themselves. The squad is in fine playing condition.

Frederick, a hundred and eighty-five pound tailback, will handle the kicking and passing along with Maloney. Both of these boys are hard runners also. Sprunt, Long, Washburn, and Morehead are capable pass receivers and will undoubtedly see action today. The line is a fast charging one and will put up a stiff defense.

Hard Scrimmage Held

Monday the Wildkittens had a hard scrimmage in which both the starting team and the reserves looked very good. The probable lineup will be: Morehead, right end; Walton, right tackle; Rainey, right guard; Young, center; Crosse, left guard; Brown, left tackle; Washburn, left end; Lacy, quarterback; Frederick and Sprunt, halfbacks; Ehly, blocking back.

Other players likely to see action are: Patterson and Brinson, ends; McIntosh, Carter, McCoy, Pharr, Grey, tackles; Dick and McCreary, guards; Tate, center; Long, Maloney, McGeachy, Beaty, Stevenson, backs.
