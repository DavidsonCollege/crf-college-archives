Life as an Internet junkie

At age ten, I had the world at my hand. My Vic 20, hooked up to a 1977 RCA 9-inch
television with a cracked screen, had the capability for programming (I could flash ‘Tony’ across the screen), could run cool
games (Hangman and Pong), but most importantly, when attached to my 200 baud Hayes modem, my computer put me in
touch with the world, or more importantly, Becky Taylor, my computer bulletin board sweetheart. The beauty of our torrid romance
was the fact that since I only dealt with her through the computer screen, I didn’t have to worry about
my bad penmanship, my ever-changing voice, or my mud-soaked Reeboks. And I could make stuff up (lie). But eventually, her
fifteen-year-old suspicious mind had me figured out:

BECKY: How old are you again?
ME: Eighteen.
BECKY: You said you were sixteen.
ME: You're not so vain as to take age into consideration, are you?
BECKY: Yeah, you’re right. What did you say you looked like again?
ME: Spiderman.
BECKY: Oh boy.

The neighborhood bulletin boards on which my trusty Commodore and I romanced pale in comparison to the mighty Internet, or
the web of networks that make up what we call E-mail. The brilliant minds behind E-mail probably designed E-mail to
be used as a clever network that linked businesses, organizations, and colleges throughout the world. Of course, nobody actually uses
E-mail for anything constructive (unless procrastination has suddenly been considered constructive), except for my friend John, who used it to
find himself a Homecoming date (Through the WOE: Women Of E-mail). John, of course, is the exception, not the rule.

People primarily use E-mail as an inexpensive way to keep in touch with friends at other schools because writing to
people through E-mail is fun and easy. All you need is an address. A network address looks like this: USER@NODE.LOCATION.DOMAIN.
For example, if you’re trying to reach Edward Yardumian at Bovine Technical Institute you would get to the MAIL> and
type, To: in%Edyardumian@Dung.BTech.justoutsideofCamden,Nebraska.pop.74.edu. Of course, you also need something to say. If you’re strapped for words, or just don’t have
the time, the people who frequently use E-mail have developed these clever little symbols to accentuate their feelings. Here are
a few examples, with their respective meanings. This character :) represents a “smile”, i.e. “I’m so darn happy, I’m smiling.”
This character ;) represents a “wink”, “I’m so darn happy, I’m winking.” This :( represents a “frown”, or i.e. “I’m
so darn unhappy because you owe me fifty dollars you buster and if you don’t pay me by next Tuesday
I’ll break your kneecaps with a sledgehammer, :) .” And for those fortunate few who find love on the Internet,
this @>—’-,— represents a “rose”, i.e. “I give you this rose, because I love you and want you to bear
my 17 children.” Use with caution.

The problem with E-mail is that it consumes valuable time. The five-minute break to check mail becomes a two-hour discussion
about the pros and cons of cashmere sweater lint. Some days you don’t want to be trapped in the maze
of the computer center corresponding to all your Internet pals. That’s why there’s one other important character that every E-mail
user needs to know: ctrl-Z i.e. EXIT.

Whose Homecoming?

Sometimes I feel like I’m not really a Davidson College student. You know, that left-out, all-alone kind of feeling. Sure,
most of the time I’m right in the thick of things with everybody else. Like during class, studying in the
library, or eating at the Commons. But not times like Homecoming weekend. Those are the times when I feel like
I’d rather not be here. I guess it’s my own fault for not joining a fraternity. It seemed like everybody
who’s a member of a social house was having fun during all the festivities: putting on their best duds, pre-game
parties, dinner, and dances. Yet somehow I felt lost in the shuffle. With no place to party or socialize or
dance, I guess I kind of felt embarrassed to ask someone for a date. I mean really, who wants to
go to Homecoming with a date that can’t even take them to a party. And it wasn’t just me. It
was a sad sight to see all the lonely souls in the T.V. lounges that Saturday night.

I sincerely believe that it is weekends like Homecoming that do the most damage to the highly prized and much-discussed
“campus unity.” Most of the time, frat parties are open to everyone, but on these special weekends, only members can
attend. But what about the large portion of the student body that doesn’t belong to houses? What about the 50%
of all sophomore males that are independent? What about all the girls that weren’t asked by all those ostracized guys?
Sure, there’s the Union-sponsored dance, but let’s not fool ourselves. Who wants to go to that when they can be
at a fraternity party? Hence, the extremely weak support of Union activities.

There’s got to be some logical solution that caters to the needs of all students and not just those in
social organizations. Maybe we could have an honest-to-God real dance that the whole student body would attend. Each fraternity could
have their own parties before and after the dance, but everybody could come together for a brief two hours, so
that everyone could feel like they were a part of the fun. Everybody could dance, and party, and socialize together.
Homecoming and other big events could truly be unified campus events. How about it? I know it’s sort of radical,
but it might just be worth a try. And then maybe I could feel like a Davidson student again.
