10 THE DAVIDSONIAN, December 4, 1919.

(Continued from page 1)

“completely bewildered their opponents, using a succession of line bucks, end runs, fake plays and forward passes. Their offensive was
decidedly the best which any team has shown in Greenville this year. They scored again in this period when after
completing several forward passes, Black hit the line for a touchdown.

In the final quarter, Davidson added three more touchdowns to her total. The first came as a result of a
series of irresistible line bucks and end runs. Johnston went around left end for the score. Davidson then executed a
kick-off onside to Black and a long forward pass to Douglass which put the ball on Furman’s 12-yard line. Spann
then shot through the line for another touchdown. The last tally came when after blocking a punt, the Presbyterians bucked
the line for the needed distance, Spann taking the oval across.

The game closed with the ball in Davidson’s possession on Furman’s two-yard line.

Relics Held in Library.

Those who happened intoThe book room last week without knowing of the war museum, certainly CHARLOTTE'S BEST CAFE. Some feet
SCHOLTZ the Florist received a severe jolt. Pictures at every turn portrayed ruined cities, charred homesteads, grinning skeletons, mud, slime
and filth unspeakable. Long, cold, slim German rifles, ragged edged bayonets, glittering swords, hungry trench knives, cartridges, shells, grenades and
weapons of all descriptions covered the right-hand table. In his zeal to complete the gruesome collection, Dr. Lingle even added
an army fork. There was also a large collection of odds and ends such as gas masks, various kinds of
helmets, belts (with “Gott mit uns” buckles), foreign coins, cartridge cases, trench shoes, decorations (including two iron crosses), wooden shoes
and other articles. The walls were covered with large maps, panoramic war pictures, officers’ commissions, and individual or group pictures
of soldiers.

In one corner was a large collection of newspapers, including a very interesting one from Siberia. On the whole, it
was a singularly complete “war museum” and reflects credit on those who arranged it.

Furman Suffers Decisive Defeat.
