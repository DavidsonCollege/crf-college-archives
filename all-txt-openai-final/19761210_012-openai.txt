its Honor Code. I would like to serve Davidson by helping to preserve the Code.

Mary Chester Morgan
Sophomore

Two years’ experience on the Student Honor Council in high school gave me an appreciation for the implications of such a position. As a D.C. student, I try to live by and expect the same of others. Judging one’s peers is a difficult task. I’m certainly not perfect, but I shall do the best I can to defend our way of life as honor-bound citizens of this college community.

Jim Crane
Freshman

The function of the Student Hearing Committee is essentially the preservation of the honor system. I firmly believe in the Honor System here at Davidson College. I feel that a working Honor System is the one quality above all others which sets Davidson College apart and above other institutions of higher education. As a member of the Student Hearing Committee, I pledge myself to use the most equitable judgment I can muster and to strive at all times for the continuation of Davidson’s truly precious Honor System.

I think that what separates Davidson from other schools is its Honor Code.

Mark Duckett
Freshman

With two years’ previous experience on hearing committees, I feel that I have enough experience to be fair and do the job well. I believe strongly in the Honor Code and would support it fully. I believe that I can do a good job.

Anne Eglin
Freshman

The purpose of disciplinary action, according to Davidson’s “Philosophy of Discipline,” “should be the maintenance of an atmosphere conducive to the attainment of the purpose of the college.” For this reason, I feel that a seat on the Student Hearing Committee should be approached by one with an attitude of seriousness and sense of responsibility. I would like to talk personally with anyone who would like to know why I feel qualified to fill a seat on this committee.

Beth Goode
Freshman

Last year I had the privilege of helping to draw up an Honor Code at my high school, but graduated before it was actually put into effect. Since coming to Davidson and experiencing such a respected system, I have become sincerely interested in helping to ensure its continued success. I feel our Honor Code is one we should be proud of and strive to follow and support.

Robert McEwen
Freshman

The Honor Code, which in itself speaks for our integrity, is an integral part of Davidson life, and is one of the main principles which separates us from other institutions.Davidson from other colleges. The Hearing Committee is an extension of the Honor Code in that students judge the acts of other students found in violation of the Code. I would appreciate your giving me the privilege of serving on the Hearing Committee, so that together we can carry on the outstanding tradition of Davidson College.

Lisa Ross  
Freshman

I feel that I can make a significant contribution to Davidson’s Honor Code. I will do my best to be totally impartial in any case that I am involved with.

Steve Smith  
Freshman

Davidson’s Hearing Committee is a valuable asset to its students. Without it, no Honor Code could exist, and thus no self-scheduled exams, etc. Consider carefully those whom you choose for such a position. Please vote “Steve Smith” Freshman Hearing Committee Seat.

Scott Thomason  
Freshman

Please do not let the fact that you may not know me deter you from considering me for the Hearing Committee. I plan to meet all freshmen before the election so that we will not be strangers to one another anymore. All I ask is that all of you give me the opportunity to serve in this position by voting for me, Scott Thomason (C108, 1977).

idsonian as a forum.” When asked if she was prepared for the job, Landis said, “Oh yeah, I’m just a martyr by nature.” She added, “Seriously, I’m not going into this blind. I’ve been working on it long enough to know what’s involved. It consequently took me a long time to decide to run, but now that I’ve decided I’m ready for the challenge,” she said.

Keller said, “It’s a huge responsibility, but I think that I’m prepared for it. I’m ready to make a commitment, and I hope that if I’m elected I'll have the energy and resources to accomplish what I’ve set before me.”

Landis chooses to use the adjectives “useful” and “intriguing” to describe the newspaper as she would ideally have it. As an example of what makes The Davidsonian more “useful,” Landis suggested the feature Arts In The Real World, which she originated this fall. “I want students to look to The Davidsonian for practical information; I want them to use it,” said Landis. She added, “I also plan to make it more useful by giving it the role as voice for the students.”

Keller wants to make The Davidsonian a more active part of student life. “We have a commitment to print the truth and to print all of the news, but I also want the paper to be somewhat entertaining,” he said. “I want it to be something people will want to read and which will at the same time educate the student body on the goings-on about campus.”
