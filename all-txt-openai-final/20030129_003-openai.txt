**College & Concerts: A Look Back**

**Road to fame led through Davidson for many musicians**

**Dave isn’t the only big name to play here**

By Matt Garfield, Editor

The year was 1966, the occasion Homecoming Weekend, and inside the now-demolished Love Auditorium, students flocked to hear Dionne Warwick
and the Righteous Brothers give sold-out concerts on Friday and Saturday nights. Among those in the crowd—actually in the last
row—was a young man who would later become Director of the Union. His name was William Brown, and as a
first-year student, he and his date didn’t have access to the good seats. But he had a great time nonetheless.

“I remember the Dionne Warwick show so vividly,” he said. “It was an enchanting night. I felt like I was
on the front row. It was a big party all weekend long. The music was terrific. It was just a
great time.”

More than 30 years later, Brown and the Union staff are preparing to welcome Dave Matthews to Belk Arena in
what may be the school’s biggest concert in decades—maybe ever. But as the 1966 Homecoming shows indicate, Matthews certainly isn’t
the only top performer to stop at Davidson. From Chicago to The Police to Phish, the College has welcomed some
of music’s top acts dating back to the 1960s.

Given its small venues and even smaller student body, Davidson has had surprising success at luring artists to campus. Brown
says the reason is two-fold: the nature of the music industry and the amazing skill of former Union Director Shaw
Smith, who spent countless hours working to make the concerts happen.

“The music world was different back then,” said Brown. “There were concerts at lots of colleges because artists would tour
for three months instead of three weeks. There was no MTV, no Internet. There weren’t as many radio stations. There
was no other way artists could get exposure. They couldn’t sell their albums without touring. Colleges were the major places
where the best music was played, whereas today colleges are almost an afterthought.”

And the second ingredient was Smith, a part-time magician who took great pride in convincing agents to book artists on
campus. “Smith was really quite a master at negotiating,” said Brown. “He had a great love for that. He would
negotiate over a period of years. He was very persistent and very persuasive. He talked about how we were a
little school that had big dreams.”

Added President Bobby Vagt: “He knew everybody in show business. We used to joke that some of his best magic
tricks were the people he used to bring here.”

Brown said the Matthews show is a unique opportunity for Davidson given the artist’s widespread popularity, but he hopes to
duplicate it in the future. “We’re going to look for this kind of opportunity on a regular basis. (But) most
acts, when they get to the point where Dave is, aren’t looking to go back to college campuses. When acts
get to this level, it’s hard to convince them to come to a 4,500-seat venue.”

Vagt said the Matthews show will bring together a wide segment of the community, from teenagers to middle-aged parents and
singles. “We got John Mayer on his way up. Dave Matthews is probably already up there,” he said. “It still
won’t cover the whole spectrum, but it’s as broad a spectrum as we’ve had in a while.”

**Early Semester Inconveniences**

**Long waits, unlisted prices frustrate many**

By Amee Patel, News Editor

Instead of relaxing the first few days back from winter break, most Davidson students endured long lines and cramped aisles
in the college bookstore while buying their textbooks. While the expensive prices of the books were to be expected, the
absence of price tags on the books and shelves were considered by most as unreasonable and unfair. Complaints that “we’re
being ripped off” could be heard throughout the bookstore the weekend before classes began.

Bookstore Manager Gwen Gardner said she regrets that the store could not properly provide for everyone, and she confirms that
the problem was quickly resolved by the beginning of the week. “This store is meant to make life easier for
you, not harder,” Gardner said. “Having shelf tags up earlier would allow students to do comparison shopping, and we do
not discourage comparison shopping and online ordering.”

To solve many of the problems encountered this semester, in the future the bookstore will open the first Saturday after
winter break. Having not anticipated the number of people already back on campus by that time, the bookstore will begin
to offer services to the early arrivers. Another convenient method the bookstore could employ is online book listings for each
course. By providing theISBN and titles on the Bookstore website, students could more easily comparison shop online. However, Gardner claims
this option would be more trouble than it’s worth. She said, “25 percent of ordering happens that weekend or the
first week. Professors order new books or will decide on a better book for one of their classes.” The continuous
changes will outdate online book listings on an almost daily basis, she said. “The bookstore is meant to provide service
so you can come to one place for all you need. You won’t get that experience anywhere else. It’s going
to be as convenient as possible,” she said. However, Whit Lowell ’05 was never won over by this promise and,
just last year, he decided to make a more meaningful one: to provide better service and prices on books to
Davidson students. This promise took shape as Statch.com. He said, “I wrote the site because I was frustrated with the
whole textbook shenanigans. About a year ago I found myself standing in those lines complaining. I knew I wanted to
ameliorate the situation... Statch is my answer because it allows you to save a lot of money on books; [it]
allows you to get stuff really quickly because it’s all local and you don’t have to stand in a line;
and you can sell your stuff to other people on campus and make a lot more money than what the
Bookstore is willing to offer you.” According to Lowell, “the response has been fantastic.” The site now has over 150
users and 205 books, a great improvement to the 24 users it had in early September. In addition to Statch.com’s
service at Davidson, similar sites are promoted at Vassar College and Tufts University. Together, All-Statch has over 520 books and
250 users. Lowell realizes for students to find their books available on the site or to sell more of their
used books, the pool of Statch.com users must increase. He admits, “The only drawback is that it has to have
a really high volume so that people can get what they need.” Whether the Bookstore or Statch.com will better provide
convenience and affordability to students, Lowell is right in saying, “Only time will tell.”

programs, and said that America would not abide those threats. Bush then laid out specific charges against the Iraqi regime,
saying that Saddam Hussein had continued to push for nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons and that the dictator has been
continuing to deceive the world into believing Iraq has disarmed. He accused the nation of wanting to “dominate, intimidate, or
attack,” and added that America “must act before dangers are upon us.” In a veiled affront to the United Nations
and traditional allies opposing military action in Iraq, Bush said “America’s role is more than to follow process... it is
to achieve a result.” Patrick Walsh ’06 observed the speech from the 3rd Cannon lounge. Walsh said, “Bush was concise,
I’ll give him that. A lot of it is very ambitious. It would be cool if he could get it
to work.” The College Republicans had put together the event for the Union and the discussion that followed with the
aid of a Washington, DC-based think tank. Travis Lee ’05, head of the College Republicans, said that because of what
had been discussed in the days leading up to the speech, he had not been surprised. He said, “[The speech]
didn’t go far enough, in certain respects, like what to do with North Korea, and there was no date on
Iraq.” Lee felt like the speech was “a decent address that set a nice tone, optimistic as it always should
be” despite some ambiguity in the proposals and a lack of details. Lee personally supported the President’s economic policies, especially
on the elimination of “double-taxation,” and was happy that Social Security privatization was brought back up, albeit briefly. McLean Quinn
’05, President of the Young Democrats, agreed that “there was a lack of specifics.” Though admitting the President “proposed a
lot of good ideas,” such as the aid policies for Africa, Quinn said he was disappointed by the “warmongering, blatantly
pro-military stance” and a professed lack of patience with the United Nations, calling it a “big failure of the administration.”
Personally, Quinn felt that many of the proposals were “too little, too late,” and he questioned the commitment of the
Bush administration to the environmental and domestic policies set forth in the speech. On Bush’s claim that tax cuts for
2004 and 2006 are already helping the economy, Quinn said, “I’m not going to blame fuzzy math for that, but
I think that it’s wrong. I think he’s cutting taxes for the wrong people.” Quinn also said that the Young
Democrats had recently taken a unanimous anti-war stance against Bush’s bellicose Iraqi policies. He mentioned the organization is selling “patriotic
T-shirts” for an Iraqi Children’s Charity. In addition, the Young Democrats will next week propose an anti-war resolution before the
SGA, and, if passed, will publicize it in the Davidsonian and Charlotte Observer. Dr. Russell Crandall, MacArthur Assistant Professor of
Political Science and consultant to the Office of the Deputy Secretary of Defense, said, “Similar to [Bush’s] speech to the
United Nations last September, President Bush used the State of the Union speech to put the onus back on Iraq
as well as US critics in the United Nations. Bush wanted to define Iraq as unarguably evil and he did
that job well.” Crandall noted that the future weeks will determine the ultimate effect of these comments.
