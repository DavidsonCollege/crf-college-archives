ACTIVE WEEK-END

(Continued from Page 1)

Before the game Saturday afternoon there is to be an Alumni Homecoming barbecue luncheon slated to take place on the lawn behind the South Wing of Chambers.

Dr. James B. Hendrix of the class of ’25, and President Cunningham are to be present at this time. Dr. Hendrix, who is the president of the Alumni Association, is now a member of the faculty of Duke Medical School in Durham.

By Monday, October 8, approximately seven hundred alumni had indicated their intention to attend the activities. It is stated that at least one thousand would probably be present.

Competition between the alumni of the two colleges is also planned for Friday afternoon. It will take the form of a golf tournament which is to be held in Charlotte.

Nobody will go so far as to swoon — but everybody'll fall for the true masculine distinction of Puritan Sportswear — its feel of snug comfort and its promise of grand, hardy wear. Your choice of lively colors, spirited patterns, up-to-the-moment styles.
