**Trump University Course**

By TONS O. DOUGH

Trump University has revised its master course schedule and its graduation requirements. The complete course catalog is available in the
new Registrar’s office on the twenty-ninth floor of the Trump National Tower next to the waterfall.

One change is a new quarterly system calendar. Classes will be held 365 days a year, with the next break
scheduled to be Leap Year’s Day in 1992. All classes, excepting this year’s due to its members’ imminent graduation, will
be required to take at least 7 courses a quarter. Graduation requirements include 120 courses with a 3.9 minimum GPA
for each quarter. Trump says he subscribes to the bigger-is-better school of thought. “I like thinking big. If you’re going
to be thinking anyway, you might as well think big,” he said.

According to Registrar Sue Ross, “All students must major in either Economics, Business Management, Construction Management, or Architecture,” each of
which will require 117 courses to complete. Area requirements include one course in each of these four areas. Now maybe
these kids will stay off that Patterson Court!”

New faculty members have not been announced, but some rumors report that I. M. Pay will chair the architectural department,
Paul Volkswagen will head the economics department, Lee Iapepsi will lead the business management department, and the people to thank
for their prompt construction of the new apartments (scheduled to be demolished for a new casino and hotel) will teach
in the new construction management department.

New courses in architecture include:
- 101 Waterfalls in Atriums and Living Rooms
- 110 Designing the World’s Tallest Building
- 120 Buildings as Phallic Symbols
- 200 New York vs. Davidson: Skyscraper Design

New courses in business management:
- 101 The Art of the Deal
- 105 I Married my Business Partner
- 215 Seminar: Run a Tight Ship and Buy a Yacht
- 220 Versatility: Skyscrapers to Sports Teams to Airlines
- 225 The Name that Screams “Quality”
- 230 Dealing with Jimmy Carter, Ed Koch, “Doonesbury” and Rent Fixers

Construction management courses include:
- 101 Skyscraper Construction
- 102 Hotel Construction
- 103 Castle Construction
- 115 Ice Skating Rink Construction
- 225 Theory: Supporting a Billion-Ton Ego with Hot Air

Economics courses:
- 101 Buying Yachts w/o Sales Tax
- 110 Towers on Nothing Down
- 121 The Economic History of Donald Trump
- 175 How to Become a Billionaire: Starting With Only A Hundred Thousand
- 200 Lawsuits for Money
- 250 Macroeconomics: How To Buy The World
- 260 Theory: The Unequal Distribution of Wealth is a Good Thing
- 300 I’ll Take Manhattan

Physical education courses (following Davidson College’s previous requirements, will continue as before. However, several new options have been added):
- 101 Fencing with City Government
- 105 Sexuality: Mixing Business with Pleasure
- 110 Tour de Trump
- 115 Yachting on the Princess

These changes reflect Trump University’s official attitude towards the liberal arts, which is one of disgust. The revised Statement of
Purpose reads, “Trump University, the university with the name that screams ‘quality,’ is dedicated to the education of future yuppies
and other fine money-grubbing young adults. As an atheist institution, our purpose is to keep all students on the road
to riches, no matter what the consequences or the means by which this wealth is achieved.” Another portion reads, “Think
big. I like thinking big. If you’re going to be thinking anyway, you might as well think big.”

**MEDIA SHOCKER! MEDIA SHOCKER!**

“Hell, yeah, I’m pissed,” yelled Walt as he was packing his bags. “We finally got this stupid station launched after
years of delays and Mr. All-American mama’s boy comes along and takes it over. He’ll probably play lots of Air
Supply and Kenny G. I could kill that asshole!”

At that moment, crack ROTC troops appeared from behind a tree and gunned Walt down. “Think small,” he whispered, then
expired.

Helms disputed the late Walt’s assessment. “No, it will not be all easy listening favorites,” he said. “Bill Carrell will
do Kappa Sig history reports five times daily and we will have live broadcasts of SGA meetings. I’m currently looking
for a nice fireplace to give inspiring chats in front of.

“No, really, I think this station will truly be cutting edge,” Helms said. “Mr. Trump said that we could also
go with a big-band format if we wanted to.”

“I like bands, I like big bands, I like big,” Trump said. “I like thinking big. If you’re going to
be thinking anyway, you might as well think big.”

**TRIPP HELMS TAKES OVER WALT RADIO**

Walt, general manager of Trump University’s WALT radio, has been replaced in one of a series of staff changes wrought
by Donald Trump in his makeover of Davidson College.

Walt’s replacement will be Tripp Helms, who also serves as SGA president.
