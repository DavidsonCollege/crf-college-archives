THE DAVIDSONIAN

Right in the midst of the hilarity at Davidson's annual Mid-Winters dance set last weekend, was the cameraman, who caught
many of the couples entirely unawares. Photos above were snapped at the Armory on Friday night, and at one of
the fraternity banquets, giving a slightly sketchy picture of a major dance at Davidson.

(1) Winston Taylor escorts date Molly Bellamy across the threshold of the Armory while handing Sergeant Burton his ticket to
the hop. (2) The Pan-Hellenic Council dances their special no-break figure on Friday night. Bradley and his orchestra furnish the
background. (3) Vivacious and charming Lyn Gardner gives out on a sentimental ballad. (4) On Friday night at the S.
& W. Kappa Sigma fraternity entertained formally for their dates and guests. Here one end of the banquet table is
seen, with various members grouped about.

(5) Casually surveying the crowd are S. A. E.'s (left to right) Dudley Jennings and George Grantham. Their dates sit
together: Misses Dot Haygood, Monte Nicholson, and Peggy Beatty, along with Hank Bahnson, who seems to see the dark side.
(6) Lyn Gardner warbles into the mike, while wearing her usual broad smile. (7) Miss Martha Bowman was escorted by
Pan-Hellenic prexy Hector McLean, and is shown here standing behind the bar where favors were presented to the girls in
the figure.

(8) Ray McKinley leans down to speak to the three “half-men” and their dates, while Jim Crutchfield smiles at his
joke. (9) Pi Kap Pan-Hellenic representative Louis Hite marches across the vacant floor towards their position in the figure, with
his date, Miss Macky King. (10) The Phi Delt snowman looks out from behind Jack Westall and Miss Ann Huntington,
while other Phi Delts glare at the cameraman. (Photos by Billy Barker. Courtesy Barker and Stuttes & Dunbar's.)

Phi Mu Plans First Annual Banquet Soon

Plans for the first annual banquet of Queen's and Davidson's musical organizations are being made by members of Phi Mu
Alpha since their last meeting on Tuesday, January 28. This banquet, which is to be an annual affair, will be
held during the spring for the members of all Queens’ and Davidson’s musical groups.

After the meeting was opened with the prescribed ritual and songs, the treasurer’s report was received. The members discussed the
proposed plan of founding a music scholarship for some freshman of above-average musical ability. The money for the proposed scholarship
is to be derived from profits from the Concert Series.

Members decided that the rules for the Annual Fraternity Sing should be drawn up by a committee composed of the
president of Phi Mu Alpha and one representative from each of the social fraternities.

Certain regulations which were in effect last year will perhaps be changed by this committee.

All but seven of last year’s 151 education graduates of Winona (Minn.) State Teachers College have obtained positions.

The Rockefeller Foundation has given $25,000 for maintenance in the coming year of the teaching and research program of the
University of Helsinki, Finland.

Of the 1,000 members of the Northwestern University faculty, almost 200 had military experience in the World War.
