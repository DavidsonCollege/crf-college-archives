The men’s and women’s track teams participated in the Charlotte Invitational on Saturday, Apr. 1. Both teams performed admirably, with runners from each team breaking school records.

For the men, Douglas Noreen ’07 won the 800-meter race with a personal best time of 1:52.26, breaking the school record set in 2000 by Dan Gibson ’01 by about 0.6 of a second. “Seeing Douglas Noreen break the school record in winning the 800 was second only to the birth of my little brother in the most exciting moments of my life,” said Lance Harden ’09. “There were so many breakout performances this weekend that it’s hard not to overlook some, but I definitely want to give credit to Justin Song ’09, Douglas Noreen, John Bialas ’07, and Jonathan Baker ’06 for throwing down truly raw exhibitions of heart, toughness, and tenacity.”

The Wildcats also performed well in the 3000 meters, with Harden crossing the line in 8:40.62 for a second-place finish. Co-captain Baker finished with a time of 8:43.24, coming in third. Baker also captured sixth in the 1500 meters, with a time of 4:05.46. Other top-10 finishes for the men came from the relay teams. The 4x100 meter relay, made up of co-captain Bialas, Ryan Hubbard ’08, Kwame Som-Pimpong ’09, and Song, came up with a seventh-place finish in a time of 42.84. The 4x400 team, consisting of Noreen, Bialas, Song, and Cisco Morales ’07, crossed the line in 3:21.87, which was good for a ninth-place finish. “The 4x400m relay team really put a nice exclamation point on the meet by leaving everything on the track and surpassing everyone’s expectations,” said Harden.

In the field events, Jim Walter ’07 and Nick Diluzio ’08 participated in the shot put, earning 16th and 17th places, respectively.

For the women, Megal Atias ’08 broke the school record in the 3000 meters, finishing fourth in a time of 10:09.22. Emily King ’09 scored a 6th place finish in the event behind Atias, coming in with a time of 10:28.16. Katurri Phillips ’08 also broke a school record, which she had previously set herself, crossing the line in the 200-meter dash in a time of 25.61. Her performance earned her 20th place in the dash. Kim Colley ’09 also had a standout performance in the 200-meter dash, finishing in 23rd place with a time of 25.93.

In the women’s 400-meter run, Colleen McKown ’08 came in 11th place, just missing the top-10 with her time of 2:18.78. Co-captain Hilary Leister '06 earned a 15th place finish in the same event. “This Saturday was really the first time outdoors that the whole team has been together for the entirety of a meet,” said Harden. “I thought the fan support from teammates and spectators really contributed to the solid performances.”

The men and women will travel to Durham, N.C., this weekend to compete.

The baseball team was busy this past week, competing in five games, three against SoCon rival Georgia Southern and one each against Wake Forest and Brown. All five games took place at home with a supportive home crowd watching from the stands of Wilson Field. The team went 2-3 on the week, with wins against GSU and Brown by scores of 6-0 and 7-6, respectively. The shutout against GSU was the first by a Davidson baseball team in over two years.

The week began with a loss, however, as the ’Cats hosted Wake Forest on Tuesday. The Demon Deacons came flying out of the gate, quickly scoring two runs in the top half of the first, but Davidson came back with two of their own in the last half of the inning when Blake Osborn ’07 ripped a clutch two-out, bases-loaded single. Wake answered with a run in the top of the second, but the ’Cats continued to put on a show offensively, scoring three runs in the bottom half to take the lead at 5-3. The Demon Deacons tied the score at five in the third and then exploded offensively with five runs in the fifth, finishing the game with 14 to Davidson’s six. Wake scored in every inning but one.

The ’Cats rebounded a day later with a win against Brown. Despite the fact that the Bears had a total of 25 runners on base during the game, they could not take advantage of opportunities, ultimately stranding 15. The ’Cats took advantage, using that and an impressive five-run sixth inning to end their nine-game losing streak with a 7-6 victory. Jay Heafner ’06 earned the save, which put him ahead of previous career leader Brad Wanzenburg ’91 for first all-time. The loss dropped Brown to 0-11 on the year.

The ’Cats continued to build momentum with a win against Georgia Southern on Friday in the opener of a three-game series. Gregory Zage ’07 started the game off right for Davidson, hitting a two-run homer in the bottom of the first. The ’Cats scored two more runs in the second to go up 4-0 and never looked back, winning by a score of 6-0. Blake Osborn ’07 pitched an extremely strong game, holding the Eagles to just three hits and no runs through seven innings. Zach Kayne ’09 finished up the last two innings, although Osborn claimed the win. When asked about his success, Osborn said, “As a pitcher, when you are able to keep the ball down in the strike zone, you give your team a chance to stay in the ball game and win. On Friday night, I was able to do that. [Catcher Alex Entrekin ’06] and I were on the same page all night and were able to keep the Georgia Southern hitters off balance.”

On Saturday, however, Davidson struggled to hold the Eagles’ offense down, allowing 18 hits in a 13-11 loss.
