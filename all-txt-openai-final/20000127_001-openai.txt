**Celebrations, citations mark Self-Selection night**

By MIKE ANDERSON
Editor-in-Chief

Amidst furious pomp and circumstance, the Patterson Court houses welcomed an influx of new members on Friday night. One hundred
eighty first-year women self-selected into eating houses, while 104 first-year men accepted bids to join fraternities. Nearly all those involved
described Self-Selection Night as an overwhelmingly positive experience. But the evening was not without some mishaps--including two hospitalizations, a fire,
and at least four alcohol citations issued by an uninvited outside law enforcement agency.

According to Patterson Court Adviser Craig Rinker, Rusk paced the eating houses with 50 new members. Forty-nine women joined Turner,
while Connor and Warner Hall welcomed 41 and 40 new members, respectively. “I had a great time!” said first-year student
Beth Gardner, who self-selected into Connor. “Self-Selection Night was even better than I expected. There was a lot of excitement
and enthusiasm.”

On the fraternity end, Kappa Sig led with 23 freshmen accepting bids, followed by SigEp and PhiDelt (22), KA (16),
PiKA (12), and FIJI (9). Results from KA and PiKA are tentative and are expected to rise slightly. Describing the
festivities as “nude fun at its greatest,” Phi Delt pledge Daniel Hanks said, “It’s definitely unlike any experience I’ve ever
been through. It was one of the most fun nights I’ve ever had.”

Rinker, who joined Davidson as Patterson Court Adviser this month, said, “From all I’ve seen so far, the Patterson Court
scene is very strong. There are a lot of individuals who are particularly enthusiastic about ‘the Court,’ which plays a
significant role on this campus.” Rinker cites the self-selection process as a particular strength of the eating houses. “By having
eating houses unique to Davidson it brings something special for those who choose to participate. Without a doubt, it brings
a bit more flexibility.”

Gardner agreed. “It did make it harder to choose a house, but it also made it a far more relaxed
and positive experience. I think all the girls were pretty happy with where they ended up.”

**“Over-consumption”**

While the evening was characterized by nearly all involved as an overwhelming success, it was not without some crises. “It
was a safe, positive evening,” said Dean of Students Tom Shandley. “But I don’t want to minimize the fact that
two students required medical attention for over-consumption. Any time a student goes to the hospital because of over-consumption that’s a
serious matter.”

Despite a popular presentation on alcohol-associated risks by Judge Vic Fleming on Thursday evening, a number of students fell ill
on Friday night. Two students were treated and released.

**MLK speakers discuss education and civil rights**

Children’s education and the impact of the Civil Rights movement were issues presented in Davidson’s Martin Luther King Observance 2000,
with the theme “The Dream Realized: A Community in Action.”

The MLK Day celebration began last fall with student support of an SGA petition. After the SGA passed a resolution
to have the celebration, the matter of planning was passed to Dean Ernest Jeffries and the King Day Committee. This
committee, composed of students, faculty, and staff, set out the plan for the day in conjunction with the Public Lectures
Committee.

“It was fantastic,” says SGA President Foster Haselden of student response to the MLK Day celebration. Dean Jeffries agrees. The
King Day Committee...Committee had worried that people wouldn’t come to the events. When asked about the effectiveness of the celebration,
Dean Jeffries replied by saying, “I have no complaints... this was the pinnacle so far for MLK Day celebrations at
Davidson,” says Dean Jeffries.

Davidson’s two-day celebration began on Sunday, January 16, when Dr. Jerry Cannon of C.N. Jenkins Presbyterian Church led a MLK
Worship Service and gospel songfest. Music was also a part of the Unity Prayer breakfast the next morning as the
Davidson Generals sang and Rev. James Howell of the Davidson United Methodist Church spoke. Children were the focus of the
midday activities on campus. Davidson volunteers cleaned up the basement of Ada Jenkins Community Center, which functions as a daycare
and after-school center for many community children. Later in the day, Davidson students Jeremy Campbell and Britta Toleman spoke with
Davidson children about Dr. King. The children also participated in an art project.

A series of seminars filled much of MLK Day. Covering topics from the “Music of the Civil Rights Movement” to
“Why was Dr. King such an Effective Leader?,” these seminars informed interested students. At a candlelight vigil sponsored by Into
the Streets, community members joined with English professor Brenda Flanagan, who read from King’s famous “I Have a Dream” speech.

80 first-year women self-selected on Friday from a local hospital. “It isn’t a big leap from being so intoxicated that
you can’t function to being in a dangerous or fatal situation,” said Shandley. “That's why we don’t hesitate to contact
medical professionals.”

A New Sheriff in Town

A swarm of law enforcement officials descended upon Davidson Friday night in a concerted effort to keep such incidents to
a minimum. According to Director of Public Safety Sam McKelvey, ten campus safety officers were on duty that night. But
they received some unexpected backup in the form of the North Carolina Alcohol Law Enforcement Division (ALE). The ALE was
not summoned to Davidson by campus officials nor officers, according to Shandley. Instead, the Dean of Students explained, the alcohol
agents were summoned to an off-campus party to assist Davidson town police officers. But while at that scene, an ALE
officer monitoring emergency radio frequencies overheard transmission about a student suffering from an acute medical condition brought on by alcohol
consumption. The agent and his team reportedly arrived on Patterson Court shortly thereafter. At least four other students later reported
receiving citations from the ALE officers. One told The Davidsonian that she was wrongfully detained in an agent’s car for
approximately one hour.

In a separate incident, Connor House was closed at approximately 10:00 after a speaker fire disabled the party’s sound system,
according to McKelvey. Connor member Gretchen Hamm described, “Everyone was having so much fun, no one even noticed that the
music stopped and the speaker was smoking.” McKelvey explained that a campus police officer successfully extinguished the fire before Davidson
fire officers arrived on the scene.

Despite the mishaps, most reactions to the night were positive. First-year student Lauren Daniel said, “There was a lot of
hype about self-selection night, but it really lived up to all of it. It was great!” PiKA member Dan Boritt
agreed, “The freshmen said they had the best time they’ve had all year and everyone else had a great time
too.”
