Davidson Places X On Celluloid Line

Byccures in Defense of X-Rated Movies

This policy forbids the showing of any films with the X-rating on our campus. The following essay is an attempt to explain the reasons for my objection and to suggest an alternative to the present rule.

The rating branch of the Motion Picture Association of America has two announced goals. One is to provide a guide for parents to aid them in their selection of films for their children’s viewing, and the other is to satisfy the censorious among us so that they will keep their grubby paws off our precious movies. A film which is rated X is one which is judged, according to standards set by trained psychologists, to be potentially harmful to anyone under the age of 16 to 18. Many members of the rating board would like to do away with the X-rating completely. They feel that parents ought to be able to raise their children in whatever way they prefer. If the child or adolescent is being exposed to the equivalent of X-rated experiences on all sides — through books, magazines, plays, paintings, and the actions and language of those around him — then there is no reason to keep him from seeing X-rated movies. The R-rating (no one under 17 allowed unless accompanied by parent or guardian) would be sufficient to aid those parents who wished to limit their children’s viewing experiences.

The main reason that the highest rating has been preserved is fear of a backlash from conservative elements. The X-rating has been a problem all along. Many people who do not know much about cinema have come to associate all films which receive this rating with those vicious, hardcore things like “Love Therapy Sessions,” “Deep Throat,” “The Healers,” “The Devil In Miss Jones,” and “Animal Lover.” As a result, many people have stopped going to X-rated films and exhibitors have stopped showing them. Some exhibitors did this for moral reasons, some because of the reduced financial benefits to be earned from these films, and some because they were afraid of offending their regular customers. The writers in “Variety,” who have much wisdom in these matters, have often suggested that the MPAA should divide the X-rating into two different ratings, one for the softcore and one for the hardcore.

Whether or not the X-rating fulfills any of its intended duties is suspect. The raters come down hardest upon sex and nudity, but I am far from sure that these things as beautifully presented in certain softcore movies are at all harmful for any viewers above the ages of 13 or 14, when one’s head is fairly full of such matters anyway, with or without the influence of the screen. The dividing line between the R and X-ratings is dishearteningly arbitrary. If a film shows seven instead of six pubic hairs or if a man and a woman are seen naked in the same scene rather than separate scenes, the film can receive an X regardless of the context in which these things are used. Because the difference is so minuscule, many directors have allowed their films to be censored from X to R. Sam Peckinpah did this with “Straw Dogs,” Stanley Kubrick with “A Clockwork Orange,” and Nicolas Roeg with “Don’t Look Now.” According to rumor at least, these films received only minor cuts. Other films received major cuts. Lindsay Anderson (or his American distributor) allowed “If...” to be literally castrated. This is something which shouldn't happen to anyone, man or film. It’s like putting a jockey strap on Michelangelo's “David.” It just doesn’t work.

The reason for all these cuts is the larger profits available to R-rated films. What has happened is that people are applying the rating code in a way that it was never intended to be used. They assume that the difference between an X-rated film and an R-rated one is the difference between pornography and the risqué. Such a formula simply will not work. The following films are all rated X: Luchino Visconti’s “The Damned,” Pier Paolo Pasolini’s “The Decameron,” Ken Russell’s “The Devils,” Aram Avakian’s “End of the Road,” Jim McBride's “Glen and Randa,” Marco Ferreri’s “La Grande Bouffe,” Vilgot Sjöman’s “I Am Curious (Yellow),” Bernardo Bertolucci’s “Last Tango in Paris,” Donald Cammell and Nicolas Roeg’s “Performance,” Paul Morrissey's “Trash,” and “Women in Revolt,” Roman Polanski’s “What?” Dusan Makavejev’s “W.R. — Mysteries of the Organism.” These films have in their casts such illustrious actors as Helmut Berger, David Bogarde, Marlon Brando, Candy Darling, Milena Dravic, James Fox, Helmut Griem, Georgina Hale, Grayson Hall, Mick Jagger, James Earl Jones, Stacy Keach, Marcello Mastroianni, Michel Piccoli, Charlotte Rampling, Vanessa Redgrave, Oliver Reed, Ingrid Thulin, Dorothy Tristan, and Holly Woodlawn. Armando Nannuzzi, Pasquale De Santis, Vittorio Storaro, and David Watkins are among their cinematographers. Piero Tosi’s costume designs for “The Damned” are among the greatest I have ever seen. Needless to say, these are valuable films, and I recommend that they be looked at Davidson. Only a few have ever come to Charlotte. “Last Tango In Paris” and “I Am Curious (Yellow)” were successes de scandale. “The Devils” and “W.R. — Mysteries of the Organism” did fairly well at the box office. These may have gotten as many as four or five bookings each in North Carolina. “The Devils” even showed briefly in South Carolina."Decameron," "Glen and Randa," "Women in Revolt," and "What?" were utter disasters. This I attribute at least in part to the common prejudice against their ratings. Although "La Grande Bouffe" did well in New York, it has not been booked in this state, and this is surely because of its rating. Most of these films are passionate moral (or at least aesthetic) statements made in spite of the box office rather than because of it. This is especially true of the English-language releases. They are films which need the support of every individual who is concerned with art rather than the destructive interference. I have the feeling that if these films meant half as much to President Spencer as they do to me, he could not possibly enforce his policy against them.

A few arguments against X-rated movies need to be dealt with. Some people say that because the directors of a few decades ago were able to make films without nudity and such, today's directors ought to be able to do the same. My response is that times have changed. It is in the temper of our age that artists cannot make prudish movies. Quite often, when they consciously stick to the R-rating, the results seem false. Another argument which is sometimes presented is that films should be censored before literature because their effect is stronger. I do not know if this is true. It is certainly true for me, but perhaps this is because I happen to have fallen fanatically in love with movies instead of books. Anyway, if the effect of visuals is stronger than the effect of the written language, this seems to me a better argument why films should have artistic freedom rather than why they should lack it. If I were to suggest that such books as "Lady Chatterley's Lover" be removed from our library, people would think I was being silly. That President Spencer wants to keep similar films off campus seems just as ridiculous to me.

Hopefully, no one thinks of Davidson College students as darling innocents who would be adversely influenced by X-rated movies. Whatever the Hell we are, we became that way a long time before we were old enough to see these films. They can only be a small influence upon us now. When I spoke with President Spencer over the phone, his explanation of the school’s policy was that a limit had to be set somewhere and that most of the exhibitors seemed to accept the X-rating as a reasonable dividing line. His observation about the majority of exhibitors is correct. However, a good many do show respectable X-rated films. In Charlotte, the Visulite, the Charlottetown Cinema, the Trans Lux Blue and Gold, and the Plaza occasionally show X-rated movies. The Janus Theater complex, the best commercial theater in this state, also occasionally shows these films. The First Avenue Screening Room and the New Yorker Theater, the two most highly regarded theaters in New York, do not hesitate to show them.

Among all the people I have ever talked with or whose columns I have ever read who seem to have a talent for responding to movies, not a single one has ever come out against X-rated movies, and most have specifically defended them. Like all film critics, I am opposed to censorship in any form. I believe that if the college can show something as tasteless as "The Sound of Music," it ought to be able to show an equally tasteless film of the opposite extreme, "The Devil in Miss Jones." But a hard-line position will get us nowhere, so I will suggest a compromise. Let softcore X-rated movies be shown here and hardcore ones be forbidden. This will generally allow for the bawdy, the ribald, the jubilant, and the erotic and will keep out much of the spurious. Anybody who reads movie reviews will have a pretty good idea of which films are softcore and which are hardcore without actually seeing the films, and I am sure that the Popular and the Fine Films Committees can discern the difference. If they need any help, I will be glad to give my advice.
