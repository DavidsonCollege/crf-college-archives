**Poll shows that professors agree on evaluation but not on method**

By JOHN SIMAN
Assistant News Editor

Professors surveyed strongly favor student evaluation of the faculty but oppose the use of a standardized evaluation form, according to a Davidsonian questionnaire completed Tuesday. The questionnaire was distributed in the aftermath of the faculty’s November 6 rejection of the standardized ICES evaluation forms. Professional Affairs Committee (PAC) Chairman Anthony Abbott said the PAC “plans to study the results of the poll” in seeking a new means of evaluation.

**SGA will evaluate if Faculty doesn’t**

The SGA voted 12-8 Monday to buy a faculty evaluation form to be used should the Faculty not select one before the end of winter term. The SGA also voted unanimously to establish a committee to search for an appropriate form, which would then be approved by the SGA Senate. SGA President John Jackson said, “The entire mechanisms of the process are not yet clear, but there definitely will be some type of faculty evaluation form out at the end of winter term.”

The PAC and Academic Vice President Price Zimmermann had selected the ICES forms for college-wide use. Both Abbott and Zimmermann said they didn’t know what sort of evaluation system the faculty will ultimately accept. In Tuesday's faculty meeting, the evaluation issue was not even mentioned. According to the terms of the Code of Faculty Evaluation passed in March of this year, the Faculty must eventually approve some type of systematic faculty evaluation by students.

“We plan to continue to work with the Dean. We are certainly not going to let the matter drop,” Abbott said. He ventured a guess about how the matter might be resolved: “Maybe we'll end up with a system that allows for a variety of forms of evaluation.” McKelway, one of the staunchest opponents of the ICES forms, said whether he or any other professor favors such evaluation is not at issue. “Student evaluation is both inevitable and inescapable,” he said, citing elements of the Code of Faculty Evaluation Procedures.

“The question is how the Administration will get this information,” Abbott said. Zimmermann feels that there ought to be some common form, like the ICES form, for the entire college. Music Professor James Swisher wrote, “I... reject the notion that I, or my work, or any student can be well-represented by a faceless questionnaire.” Thirty-four professors in the poll opposed the use of a uniform questionnaire.

Jackson maintained that students have a right and a duty to participate in faculty evaluation. He maintained that students are more than mature enough to evaluate their professors and added that the administration needs to put stock in student opinion. Jackson stressed that he would prefer that the faculty adopt their own evaluation form but said, “It’s just time to get something moving. The forms have been in committee for over a year and a half with no result.” The forms would be given out by professors willing to do so in their classes. Jackson admitted that many professors will probably refuse to administer the forms, but said the SGA is working on several different ways of getting around this (See SGA, page 11).

**Most offices will be uncontested next Tuesday**

Next week’s student elections will feature only two contested races, those for Union President and Social Vice President. The other elective positions are uncontested. No candidates have declared for the office of Quips and Cranks editor(s). The editor will be appointed after interviews by the Media Board, according to SGA President John Jackson.(Articles about the individual candidates and elections appear on page 2.)

Jackson was upset over the poor response to the elections. He felt that "at a school that takes as much pride in students (See Elections, page 11).

$10,000 goal set for Davidson's Cambodian fund
By ANN TUTWILER
Staff Writer

In Cambodia, "life and death are measured out in truckloads." The Davidson Community is trying to raise $10,000 to send truckloads of life to the millions starving in Cambodia. To reach that goal, a $5 average donation is needed from each student and $10 from each faculty and staff member. Beginning Sunday, members of the Y Student Service Corps will canvas dorms asking for individual contributions. The Freshman Council will be manning collection jars placed throughout the College Community. Eating houses, the Union, DCPC, and other campus groups are also joining the effort. The court’s response has houses eating breakfast for dinner and donating the money saved to the fund. Thursday night, the Union sponsored an alternative giving booth at the Campus Christmas Party. Last Sunday, the College Church raised $1,800 from a CROP lunch. Some off-campus houses are serving non-alcoholic beverages and sending the savings to the fund. The faculty and staff are sharply curtailing expenses for their annual party. The culmination of the Drive will come Wednesday, Dec. 12, after the basketball game when the Union will host a benefit in the 900 Room.

$50,000 in birthday presents help to insure WDAV's classical future
By ELIZABETH KISS
Assistant News Editor

WDAV, the College’s one-year-old classical music station, reached its $25,000 goal in last week’s radiothon pledge drive. In addition, on November 29, station director Ed McIntyre was informed that WDAV will receive a one-time capital grant of $25,000 from the Duke Endowment for the purpose of erecting a new transmitter tower. McIntyre described the $50,000 weekend as an “exhilarating experience.” The radiothon was the second in the station’s history. The first one last May netted $12,600. “We're very pleased—even a little surprised—at the success of the pledge drive,” McIntyre said. Contributions account for half of the station’s annual operating budget of $100,000. The other half is given by the College. McIntyre said that money for capital expenditures such as the purchase of equipment comes from outside the College budget. The Duke grant will cover about half the expected cost of erecting a new tower. A 350-foot tower from Orange, Va., will be given to WDAV by Transcontinental Pipeline Company. At present, WDAV’s antenna is on a 280-foot tower owned by Transco. Since the radio signal occasionally interferes with Transco’s microwave equipment, WDAV has agreed to move their antenna. “We are negotiating with North Meck for a piece of land to erect the new tower,” McIntyre said. “We'd like to increase our power rating when we move," he added. Any change in WDAV’s present 18,500-watt signal strength would be subject to FCC approval. An increase in power, if there is one, would be another step in WDAV’s occasionally turbulent ten-year history. The station began in 1969 as an on-campus carrier current radio. In 1973, the Trustees authorized its expansion to a 10-watt FM station. Then, in 1977, the Trustees decided to make WDAV a high-power station with a signal capable of reaching all of Mecklenburg County. In response to a petition for a classical music radio station signed by 10,000 people in Charlotte, the Trustees voted to have WDAV play “primarily classical music.” At the time, about one-third of WDAV's programming was classical. The students who ran WDAV on the one hand, and the College Administration and Trustees on the other, disagreed about the station’s status. Was it an official college radio station or a student station? (See WDAV, page 11)
