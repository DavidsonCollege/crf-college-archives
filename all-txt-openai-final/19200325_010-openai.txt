“STOVER AT YALE”
HAS LESSONS FOR
EVERY COLLEGE MAN

Any Reader of This Book Will be
Greatly Profited by Its Story.

One of the most popular books in
the library is the old reliable “Stover
at Yale.” Those who have not read
this book should read it now by all
means. There are striking parallels
in its theme and our own college ac-
tivities. Being a football story and
one of college life, one does not sup-
pose that it has any moral to point
to the reader, but it does teach us
some valuable lessons which more
of us should know about.

The spring elections have been
brought to our attention by an edi-
torial several weeks ago. At Yale
the captain of the football team was
in the quadrangle on tapping day for
the Senior Societies. Only one more
tap to be made! Out runs a Senior
and taps a friend beside him. Turn-
ing, the captain smilingly congratu-
lates his friend, although he has just
lost one of the biggest things in col-
lege. What lessons did this teach?
It taught him how to taste defeat
with a smile and magnified his char-
acter a hundred fold more than if
he had gotten the tap. There will be
similar instances here at Davidson.

This is only one item, taking only
half a chapter’s space, and yet see
how aptly it applies to Davidson.
Read this book and profit by its
truths, above all that no matter how
opinion may frown, work will finally
win its reward.

Every Alumni and friend of Davidson College should have a copy of

“O DAVIDSON”

THE COLLEGE FOOTBALL SONG AND ALMA MATER

Words and music original, written by two students of Davidson
College. As a noted orchestra leader said, it will compare favorably
with any popular college song written. It is now being played by
most of the dance orchestras in and around North Carolina. It is of
the same type as the “Washington and Lee Swing,” the “Spirit of
V.M.I.” written in one step, or march time with true loyal Davidson
words. It is the coming college song of the South and no supporter of
this institution should be without a copy.

Price, 35c per copy, or three copies for a dollar.
