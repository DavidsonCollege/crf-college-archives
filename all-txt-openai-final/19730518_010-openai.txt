Trackmen Smash State ‘24’ Marathon Record
By MARK CONNORS
Asst. Sports Editor

(Ed. Note: During a 24-hour period, running from 4 p.m., May 11 until 4 p.m. the following afternoon, 10 insane
Davidson trackmen ran a continuous relay around the Davidson track for a total of 237 miles. The following is an
account of that amazing odyssey as recalled by one of the participants, sprinter Mark Connors.)

It all began on Friday, May 11 at 4 p.m. Although it had been in the semi-planning stages for the
entire track season, plans for a 24-hour marathon relay did not begin to materialize until the last week. During the
first week in May, several of the members of the relay team circulated around Davidson and collected approximately $150-200 to
be donated to the Day-Care Center in Davidson upon the completion of the relay. Although this was the primary objective
of the relay, it was also a unique challenge which 10 members of the track team wanted to accept. Little
did we know then how hard this challenge would become in the wee hours of the morning after running for
13-14 hours.

During the entire marathon, each member of the team ran a mile, and then had approximately 50 minutes to rest
as the others ran their miles. Then the whole cycle started again. Ricky Bell started things off at exactly 4
p.m. as he moved out to the sound of stereo music pumped over the P.A. system. (This music would later
prove to be a veritable lifesaver during the long hours of darkness.) Second man of the Marathoners 10 was Bob
Lautensack. Lautensack would eventually tire, but not before running a 4:55 mile, the fastest of the entire 24 hours. Third
man was Rick “the Lube” Deal, the primary organizer of the event. Lube had run on one other 24-hour relay,
in which the North Carolina record had been set at a cool 193 miles and some odd yardage. By the
time we finished, we would have broken that record by over 44 miles.

Fourth man on the roster and another veteran of 24-hour competition was Bill Cole. Cole deserves a great deal of
credit for he ran his last ten miles on a blister the size of a silver dollar. Fifth man, or
machine I should say, was Jesse Smith. After coming to a general conclusion that Smith does not have a pain
center in his brain, we all watched Jesse run the quickest and most consistent pace. When he finally said that
he hurt about 23½ hours into the relay, we all knew that none of us was going to last very
much longer.

The last five runners were the true masochists. All sprinters at heart, we decided that only one mile at about
every hour wouldn't be that bad. We were wrong. Sixth man Chuck Sudetic, though, was probably the most hellacious runner
next to Smith. Dave Kittrell, running seventh, was the man that kept us all together, as he did the entire
track season. I ran the eighth leg and will say no more. Tim Walker ran the ninth leg and Mark
Postove ran last.

We all went through several different stages in the course of the 24 hours. Starting off with a very optimistic
and excited outlook on the upcoming hours, we moved on to a very serious and determined mood that lasted until
about 4 a.m. It was during this period that most everyone ran his best. About 4 a.m., however, the real
pain began to set in on everyone and some tempers flared. As dawn approached, although sore and very tired, our
spirits picked up and remained until the finish.

Our diet over the 24-hour period was truly unique. LivingOn Gatorade, salt pills, dextotabs, and chocolate for the most part,
the most interesting course in our cuisine was what came to be known as the **Couch Shake**. A concoction dreamed
up by Coach Tom Couch consisting of skimmed milk, raw egg, sugar, and vanilla, it proved to be quite tasty
and was essential to our endurance. If I had not been part of the **Couch Shake for Lunch Bunch**, I
probably would have lost 20 pounds, whereas with it, I only lost 12.

If a player wants to contribute to another sport, he is entitled to. The team will conclude spring practice after
the game Saturday so the players will have time to prepare for exams. “We're a little banged up right now,
but if we can steer clear of any big injuries to any of our starters next fall, we'll be in
good shape,” said Fagg. He is also pleased with the incoming freshman class. So far Davidson has signed 23 players
to grant-in-aids and is still talking to several other prospects. Fagg expects that several of the prospects can help the
team next fall.

Quarterbacks Tim Barr and Gary Overstreet are both good prospects, according to Fagg who was particularly impressed while recruiting and
scouting Overstreet. John Garland is another player who is expected to help the team. Garland is a 6’0” 250 lb.
defensive tackle. Other recruits mentioned by Fagg are tight end Mike Soash and defensive back Phil Mulkey. Fagg again stressed
that all five look “very strong” and can help the team next fall.

The status of the team’s running backs is not certain at this time. Starters Ingold and Webel are both sidelined
with injuries. Webel looked impressive in early practices until he injured his shoulder last week.

Mine was not the only large weight loss, however, with almost everyone losing about the same amount. Although the North
Carolina record was broken and we all proved to ourselves that it could be done, the most satisfying thing to
us was the genuine concern shown us by the college community. When presented with our plan, everyone involved was more
than willing to help in every way they could. We especially appreciated the encouragement from the students, most especially the
members of the football team, who constantly came out to the track to cheer us on. A very special thanks
goes to Mitch Purvis, Pete Celentano, and Dennis Keely who stuck it out with the team the entire night, with
Purvis going the total route.

Saturday at 4 p.m., during the intrasquad football scrimmage, the 10 of us ran the last lap together and finished
a total mileage of 237 miles, 1140 yards. There were no newspaper men, no TV cameras, and no big brass
bands waiting to greet us. We all cleaned up and casually went our way with an air of total self-satisfaction,
along with a deep admiration for the other nine on the team. It seems like a dream now, but at
that time, it was very, very real.
