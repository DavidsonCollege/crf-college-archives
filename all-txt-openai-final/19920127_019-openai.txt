ON THE SPORTS FRONT

By Bruce Balestier

When, with nine seconds left in Davidson’s game Saturday night with Winthrop and the Wildcats trailing by three points, Janko
Narat hit a closely-guarded jump shot from just under 20 feet away, it seemed a script-like conclusion to a gutty
and tenacious comeback. In addition, it seemed perfect redemption for the 40 minutes of generally poor basketball the Wildcats had
perpetrated on the crowd in attendance. Swept up in the emotion of the moment, the five players on the court
for Davidson worked to prevent a desperation game-winning shot by the Eagles, and were no doubt ready to get on
with the business of winning the game in overtime.

Unfortunately, no one noticed until just two seconds remained that the referee had signaled for a two-point basket, and that
Narat’s clutch shot had brought Davidson only to within one point. By the time Detlef Musch was able to foul
Winthrop’s Carlo Wilkins, the Wildcats’ chance for victory had fallen by the wayside. Narat’s heave from beyond halfcourt at the
buzzer bounded harmlessly off the backboard.

Thus spoiled was an otherwise perfect comeback. The ‘Cats had used clutch shooting and defense, along with missed Winthrop free
throws, to bounce back from the seven-point deficit they faced with just over two minutes to play. It seemed possible
that they might escape with a win despite playing two halves of very uninspired basketball.

After the game, Davidson center Detlef Musch lay on a table in the Training Room with an ice-pack strapped to
his calf. Somehow, in the waning moments of the game, a kick to Musch’s shin had burst a blood vessel,
causing a hematoma in his calf which had swelled to the size of a baseball. Through the often intense pain,
Musch said, “I can’t believe we lost by one point.”

Indeed, there was cause for alarm in the loss. Having lost already to three of the top four teams in
the Big South standings (Charleston Southern, Coastal Carolina and Liberty), a win against fifth-place Winthrop was imperative. The narrow loss
(Davidson's fourth by two or less points to the Eagles in the last three years) raised familiar questions about the
team. It seems clear that the ‘Cats are a better team than they are showing themselves to be. A team
that plays competitively with top-20 teams Alabama and UNCC should not lose to Winthrop.

NCAA Compliance Director Ingram Sheds Light On Student Athlete Participation

There has been a great deal of debate surrounding the amount of time required to participate in intercollegiate sports. Last
year the NCAA passed legislation which declared that a maximum of 20 hours per week could be “required” of student-athletes
who are “in-season,” and that 8 hours was the limit on individuals or teams participating in coach-directed activity outside their
traditional playing seasons.

What does the situation at Davidson College look like? The table below shows the average participation time per week for
Davidson’s varsity teams. (During December, for the most part, there was no practice.) The numbers reflect average hours per week
taken from athletically-related activity forms filled out by coaches and/or student-athletes and verified by members of the teams.
