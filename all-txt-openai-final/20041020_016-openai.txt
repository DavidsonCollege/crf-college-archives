**Football Brings Home PFL Victory**

The football team earned an important victory this week, as they improved to 2-4 on the season and 1-1 in the PFL South division. They defeated eighth-ranked Morehead State 14-10 in a defensive struggle and propelled themselves into contention for the PFL South title.

Davidson didn’t shine on offense, as the Wildcats managed only 227 yards of total offense on the day, but did enough to win the game behind 185 yards on the ground from John Leverett ’05 and two touchdowns from wide receiver Brett Dioguardi ’07. Turnovers continued to plague the offense, as the ’Cats gave the ball over twice on the afternoon, including a Damion White ’05 interception on the opening drive of the game after Davidson had moved inside the Morehead State 10. Davidson was also fortunate to have only two turnovers, as the Wildcats recovered two of their own fumbles as well.

Despite the struggles, Davidson was able to put the ball in the end zone twice in the first half, and Leverett’s 185 yards marked his fourth consecutive 100-yard game, and the 12th of his career. The senior tailback is now just 250 yards from the all-time Davidson mark for career rushing yards.

On the other side of the ball, the defense did an excellent job of holding the Eagles to only 237 yards and also forced three takeaways. Defensive captains Brendan Dete ’05 and Kevin Saunders ’05 recorded 14 tackles each. Dete also recorded a sack, and Saunders added a key fumble recovery for Davidson. Meanwhile, Chris Leftwich ’05 recorded four tackles, one sack, a forced fumble, and two fumble recoveries in a very strong performance.

**Verge of Breaking Rushing Record**

Running back John Leverett ’05 has had a phenomenal career. However, there are still challenges to be met and goals to achieve as the season and his career wind to a close. Of course, Leverett holds team goals in the highest regard, such as winning the Pioneer Football League crown this fall. Besides that, however, Leverett has a chance to leave Davidson with some amazing personal achievements as well.

Over the rest of this season, Leverett has the opportunity to set the Davidson football career rushing mark, which is held by Ray Sinclair ’82. Currently, including play Saturday against Morehead State, Leverett has 2,835 career rushing yards, just 250 yards behind Sinclair’s record. Leverett, however, is quick to dismiss this talk. “I didn’t get into this position by focusing on the records every play, so starting to do that now could only cause me to play differently,” he stated.

He hasn’t been playing differently thus far, either. Leverett’s day against Morehead State was a big one, as he rushed for 185 yards on 27 carries to account for more than 75 percent of the Wildcat offense.

Jacksonville, he rushed for 259 yards and three touchdowns on 30 carries, tying a career high for yard rushing in a game. Ironically, the mark was one yard shy of the record held by none other than Sinclair. During the game, Leverett broke the Davidson career record.

Women’s Soccer improves to 6-1 in Southern Conference

Kristen Koehrn ’08 and Heidi Wilbrant ’07 used their heads to lead the women’s soccer team in its afternoon win against Furman this Sunday. Scoreless after more than sixty-five minutes of play, Anne Stevens ’07 began the winning play with a perfectly placed corner kick to the far post. Koehrn found the ball in the air and redirected it across the goal to teammate Wilbrant, who headed it past the opposing goalie for the one and only score of the game. Wilbrant has five goals so far this season. Goalkeeper Sarah Hobart ’05 recorded seven saves, as well as her third shutout this season, in the victory. It was a tough match overall, with both teams’ defenses playing a hard ninety minutes. Despite the final score, Furman out-shot Davidson 12-8. This win added to the Wildcats' already impressive record (9-6, 6-1) and keeps them in first place in the Southern Conference.

Playing the Citadel, who is currently winless in SoCon play, on Oct. 13 was good practice for the Furman game. Davidson blew by the Bulldogs at Alumni Stadium for a final score of 12-0. In the first half, Koehrn had two goals and an assist to Stevens, and Wilbrant scored off of one of two assists from midfielder Nancy Haskell ’08. The domination continued after halftime, as Maggie Womack ’07 and Koehrn each scored a pair of goals in the second half.

Veteran goalkeeper Sarah Nolan ’05 was named Defensive Player of the Week in the NorPac Conference's East Division. Nolan racked up 20 saves against American, bringing her tally over the 477 save mark in her career, a new school record. She has also posted 10 shutouts in her career.

Sarah Hobart ’05 makes one of her seven saves in the victory against Furman. Furman out-shot Davidson 12-8, but Hobart was still able to record her third shutout of the season.

PLAY OF THE WEEK
With 2:06 still on the clock, Davidson was clinging to a tenuous 14-10 lead and faced a critical third and 11 from the Davidson 19. While conventional wisdom would suggest running the ball and forcing Morehead State to use its third and final timeout to stop the clock, head coach Mike Toop called for a pass from quarterback Damion White ’05. White then threaded a 14-yard completion to Brett Dioguardi along the sideline for a first down. With the fresh set of downs, the Wildcats were able to keep the ball on the ground and run out the clock without allowing Morehead State's offense to get back on the field.
