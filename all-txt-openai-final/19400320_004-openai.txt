Cats Meet Clemson; Diamond Dust

Wed., March 20, 1940

This week saw Coach Shepard put his Wildcat diamonders through intense drills. With only three days remaining before the opening
battle against Clemson’s Tigers, the Cats are far behind in training. Besides Clemson, Davidson will engage Presbyterian and Erskine on
their swing through the South. They return here to play Richmond and Colby on Wednesday and Thursday.

Coach Shepard altered his lineup in an effort to add strength to the outfield, shifting Grey Hunter and Frank Niven,
both regular infielders last year, to the outer gardens. Jim Hogg having reported for practice, Rusty Edmundson has been placed
behind the bat. At second base, Tommy Yarborough, a hard hitter, seems to have won his spurs. Jim Owens will
hold down the shortstop position, and Bob Smith has taken over the hot seat and made allies at third base.
The battle for outfield positions has become spirited with the shifting of Hunter and Niven. Hugh Morris apparently is installed
in center, Jay Bolin, Winston Taylor, and Mac Morris are leading candidates for the posts in right and left.

Around The Majors

Having completed our trip through the South and California covering the Major League training camps, we now feel in a
position to make some rash predictions as to pennant winners, cellar-dwellers, etc. Of course, first and foremost are the Yankees.
Presenting the same power-laden lineup that made mince-meat of the Reds last fall, the Bronx Bombers should squeeze their way
into the World Series by the narrow margin of twenty games. Most opposition should come from Boston's slug nutty Red
Sox and Cleveland’s Indians. The Bosox have been strengthened by the addition of the famous Dominic DiMaggio. Lou Boudreau and
Ray Mack have given the Indians the second base combination they have lacked for twenty years. The Tigers and White
Sox are always dangerous, but too many ifs and whens keep them from being real threats. The other teams are
just that—other teams.

Shifting over to the number one minor league, the National, we find the Reds and Cardinals the least worse of
a sorry lot. Brooklyn’s Dodgers, packed with former Major Leaguers from the American, may pull a surprise and give the
favorites a battle. The Cubs and Giants just don’t seem to have it. The Pirates can be counted on to
fold. As for the rest, ’nuf sed.

Inexperienced Baseball Squad Holds Initial Practice Game

Friday For Three-Game Southern Swing; Rookie Sluggers Powerful

In spite of inclement weather last week, Coach “Pete” Whittle’s tracksters are rounding into form and rushing preparations for their
opening meet. He believes that prospects are brighter than they have been in a number of years and expects a
highly successful season.

Linkmen Play Trial Rounds

Davidson’s golf team, which had a very successful season last Spring, has begun qualifying for positions on this year’s edition
of the foursome. Qualifying rounds played so far are as follows: Jimmie Cooper 79-80-81, Charlie Pegram 79-80-81, Granville Sharpe 80-79-80,
George Abels 86-85-83, George Wright 80-79-81, Job Bryant 89-87-84, and George Wright 80-79-81. Davidson’s John Green, Bill Burch, and Bill
Burch have had a few preliminary intersquad matches. Qualifying rounds should have been completed by last Tuesday, as the first
match is this afternoon.

Heavy Schedule

The team has twelve matches scheduled for this season and they may add a few later in the season. The
Wildcats will enter the State, and Southern Conference meets that are to be held over the South during this Spring.

Golf And Tennis

The Wildcat linkmen, who lost but one of their nine matches last year, will be paced by Co-captains Cooper and
Sharpe. The tennis team, which managed to round into fair shape, will be paced by Co-captains Rea Tenney and Loch
Hunter, who will probably alternate with Billy Turner in playing in the number one post. Dick Shore, who was unable
to play last year, strengthens the team. McAlpine won his letter his sophomore year in the 440-yard division.

Sophs Shine

According to Whittle, those candidates showing the most promise in the early drills are Strandwitz in the high jump, Knoeller
in the weights, Taylor and Williamson in the low and high hurdles respectively, Jonas in the 440-yard run, and Captain
Kellogg in the 880-yard run. The return of “Popeye” McAlpine, who was unable to run last year because of a
foot injury, strengthens the team. McAlpine won his letter his sophomore year in the 440-yard division.

With the conclusion of spring football drills, the team was unable to make any predictions as to talent represented by
the yearlings. The weakest department appears to be the field events.

Practice Game Held

A practice game was held Saturday afternoon. Hayseed Thomas hurled for one squad with George Ficklen relieving him, while Dizzy
Dave McLean went the distance for the other outfit. Jim Hoge, Rusty Edmundson, Mack Morris, and Hugh Verner led the
slugging throughout the game.

Sophs Star

Coach Shepard’s probable starting initial will be a rookie outfit with three sophomores in the infield. Hoge is at third;
and either Hunter, Verner, Bolin, Taylor, and Morris are candidates for the outfield posts. The field posts are as follows:
Hunter, Verner, Bolin, Taylor, and Morris.
