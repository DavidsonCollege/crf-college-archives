WALT Radio has plans for SUCCESS

New enthusiasm by Davidson students and an initiative by President Bobby Vagt have resulted in improvements at WALT Radio. WALT Radio, which airs on 1610 AM, is the College’s student-run radio station. Although a membership count for this semester has not been made, last semester’s membership consisted of nearly 100 student DJs. The number of participating students is expected to increase early in the semester.

The radio station, nevertheless, has been steadily losing listeners for the past several months. There are two reasons that account for the disappearance of the WALT radio audience. First, a weakened signal made it impossible to maintain the listener audience WALT Radio had in September of 1998. In fact, the signal became so weak by winter break last year that reception of WALT became fuzz, even close to the station’s studios, located in Johnson Gym. Second, WALT’s broadcasts became erratic. For example, the station might broadcast for a while in the morning and then discontinue any broadcasting until peak listening hours from 8:00 PM to 1:00 AM. The difficulties in broadcasting the station to most places on campus resulted in fewer students being able to enjoy WALT programming.

In the first semester of this academic year, the Executive Board of WALT Radio began looking into possible remedies to the station’s dying signal. Station manager Barrett Mallos approached President Vagt, who located a radio technician and arranged a meeting between him and WALT Radio. The technician will work on improving WALT’s signal. The technical improvements have already begun. Adjustments were recently made to the soundboard at WALT and the station can now be heard as far as Mooresville. In the board’s major review of operations, scheduling changes were also imposed and the station is now broadcasting around the clock seven days a week.

“An expanded promotions budget now enables the station to reward loyal listeners with free giveaways, such as CDs, concert tickets, and posters,” proclaims Mallos. In an interview with the Davidsonian, Mallos expressed his great appreciation for President Vagt’s support of WALT. Vagt’s concern for the radio station marks the end of a long silence on the part of the administration following the hostile takeover of the then student-run WDAV.

Kristen Taylor, a WALT Executive Board member, went on to discuss some of WALT’s long-term goals. Chief among them are switching away from AM to FM, a move that President Vagt has openly discussed for some time. Before the switch can be made, several steps must first be completed. WALT must find a generous benefactor to donate an FM antenna and submit an application to the FCC, as AM and FM antennas are not interchangeable. The station is also trying to find the means to purchase music from the period of time that no student radio

Kells Hetheringtonstation existed. In addition, a “remote feed signal apparatus” has been placed on the list of items that the station would benefit from having. An RFSA would enable the station to make remote broadcasts and allow, for example, student radio coverage of sports events. Finally, the radio board will ask the College Union to play WALT. WDAYV, a classical radio station loosely affiliated with Davidson College, is currently the station to which the College Union tunes its radio.

Coffeehouse. CHEAP LARD! 8:15 - A healthy future for WALT depends heavily on the 1999-2000 budget. Budgets for operations such as the radio station are allocated by the Activities Tax Council. The budget for 1998-1999 initially totaled only five hundred dollars. Later in the year, WALT’s budget was supplemented with fifteen hundred dollars from the College Union surplus and a gift from Jeff Batten. Unfortunately, the small budget continues to restrict WALT operations.
