**Still Whistlin' Dixie**

**Another great one from George Strait and band**

By Geoff Graham

"Easy Come Easy Go" marks George Strait’s eighteenth release into the realm of Country music. That includes a Christmas album,
three greatest hits, and a motion picture soundtrack. In addition, George has ridden the rodeo circuit and starred in last
year’s blockbuster, "Pure Country." What could be next for the superstar? He might just write one of his own songs,
but don’t count on it. George is one of the few popular Country singers who writes none of his own
material. But, before you criticize his authenticity, keep in mind that he is also one of the few popular Country
singers who can rope or ride.

We can view George’s aversion to the pen and pad in two ways: Either he’s just another joker with a
hand-me-down guitar and a decent voice, or the man’s got real talent. His longevity tends to support the latter explanation.
George is a great performer with a fantastic voice. More than likely, he realizes, unlike many in the industry (Brooks
and Dunn, Sawyer Brown, and occasionally Dwight Yoakam, to name a few), that everyone benefits from the exploitation of a
good songwriter’s ability. We not only hear exceptional songs, performed by an extraordinary artist, we avoid a couple of pitfalls.
We don’t have to hear George embarrass himself with a poorly written song, and we don’t have to hear songwriters,
tempted to perform, embarrass themselves with poorly sung, yet well-written tunes.

Teamwork is the moral here. It makes the world go ‘round. George gives the writers a job, the writers give
George a job, we buy the albums, and everybody smiles. "Easy Come, Easy Go" is another testament to teamwork’s success.
George, once again, enlisted the aid of veteran songwriters (Jim Lauderdale, Steve Dorff, Dean Dillon, among others) to produce another
great one. As far as tunes bound for his fourth greatest hits album, "Easy Come Easy Go" is pregnant with
possibility. The title track, which you may have heard on the radio (it’s being overplayed into oblivion), will definitely reappear
sometime. It’s a slow, plucked song, and a good dance tune. “Without Me Around” is suspiciously reminiscent of Garth Brooks’
“What She’s Doin’ Now.” Same subject, same style, same calibre. This might be the next one to hit the airwaves.
“The Man In Love With You” is Everyman’s love song to the woman he knows he doesn’t deserve. If “I
Cross My Heart” gave you chills, expect the same from this one.

With the exception of one song, the rest solidly support the album. “Lovebug” is the only stain on "Easy Come
Easy Go." Happy and bouncy are two adjectives you might associate with this one. If George appears on “Sesame Street”
sometime soon, I’m sure he’ll play it. Expect to hear George Strait for years to come. He won’t burn out
as long as he keeps his resources tapped and flowing. Buy the album. It’s worth it, just like the last
one, and the one before that, and the one before that. Until next time, vaya con dios.

**Strange days: The short career of The Doors**

By Rachel Newcomb

It is difficult to find an excuse to write about a band that is no longer viable—a band that not
only doesn’t rehash old hits at reunion tours, but hasn’t released an album of new material since 1971. The Doors
had a brief but profound impact upon the music scene, but their place in music history is often maligned. “Light
My Fire” is overplayed on classic rock stations, and Jim Morrison has been dismissed by critics as an amateurish lyricist
who wrote nothing better than junior high poetry. Looking beyond the greatest hits, there is a wealth of well-crafted Doors
songs that showcase the band’s uniqueness and distinct sound.

Jim Morrison, the Doors’ charismatic frontman whose life gradually spiraled to destruction, was an extremely enigmatic figure as well. In
1965, Morrison was a drifter who had recently dropped out of U.C.L.A. film school a week before he was to
receive his diploma. A loner by nature, he read voraciously everything from Nietzsche to Dylan Thomas to Jack Kerouac. He
wrote extensively as well, keeping notebooks since his high school years full of poetry, personal reflections, and philosophical musings. When
he met keyboardist Ray Manzarek at U.C.L.A. film school, they formed the nucleus of what was to become The Doors.
Adding John Densmore on the drums and Robby Krieger on guitar, they began to play in small clubs around Los
Angeles. The band’s name was derived from two sources: an Aldous Huxley essay entitled “The Doors of Perception” detailing Huxley’s
experiments with LSD, and a quote from poet William Blake, “If the doors of perception are...

**Chuck Davis aims to preserve African dance traditions.**

By Josh Larned

On Friday, November 5, Davidson College welcomes the African-American Dance Ensemble to Love Auditorium. Performing under the leadership of renowned
director Chuck Davis, the group’s mission is to “preserve and share the finest traditions of African and African-American dance and
music through...Research, education, and entertainment.” Indeed, Chuck Davis and his talented troupe have overwhelmingly achieved these goals, as evident in
the far-reaching reputation they have gathered for themselves in the African-American dance community. Their hodgepodge of rhythmic percussion, song, and
costume (all derived from traditional African settings) provide a unique learning experience for those unfamiliar with this cultural heritage. The
African-American Dance Ensemble originated from Davis’s own visionary mind in 1964, upon witnessing a performance of the Senegalese National Dance
Company at the New York World’s Fair. At this point, a desire was kindled within Davis (who was studying dance
at the time) to devote himself to the study of African dance. He sought to capitalize upon this dream by
forming the much-heralded Chuck Davis Dance Company in 1968. After studying in West Africa during the late 1970s, he and
his company began to collaborate increasingly with the organizers of the American Dance Festival, located in Durham, North Carolina. Out
of this relationship developed the African-American Dance Ensemble in 1984.

Witnessing the AADE is quite an experience, as their energy and ability to interpret with clarity this very complex art
form create a celebratory atmosphere which engulfs the audience. As a result, a mood of spirit and cultural harmony pervades
their performance. For those who are further interested in the AADE, they will be holding a lecture demonstration on Friday,
November 5 at 10:30 a.m. in the 900 Room. The presentation will involve participation from interested members of the audience.
According to Cultural Events Director Suneya Gupta, “it will be an excellent preview of the evening’s performance.” By all means,
go check out the African-American Dance Ensemble if you have the time and inclination to do so. Their performance should
prove to be the best party at Davidson on Friday night. Tickets are $3.00 for students.

Movie Review
Rudy is little more than an attack on the happy button
By Alex Crumbley

Do you get sentimental during long-distance commercials? Do you cry when bugs splat on your windshield? When someone next to
you in class makes a bad grade, do you grab his hand, look him in the eye, and say with
great sincerity, “I can feel your pain?” If you answer “yes” to any of these questions, head straight for Movies
at the Lake and get your front row ticket for Rudy, perhaps the most shamelessly sentimental, tear-jerking movie ever made.

At the risk of giving away the intricate, surprising plot, I’ll go ahead and say that it’s about this guy
who wants to play football for Notre Dame, works for a few years, and finally gets on the team. I
write this because if you couldn’t figure it out for yourself in the first five minutes, you’re probably not old
enough to read, anyway. Rudy is the son of a factory worker who is a big Notre Dame fan, and
he is raised all his life watching them play on television. His dream is to play for Notre Dame, but
it seems that a door closes in his face every time he tries to realize that dream. He overcomes significant
obstacles, and finally finds success. The true story that Rudy relates is impressive, but if you're looking for the nineties
version of Hoosiers or The Natural, this just ain’t it.

The film does have its strengths. It is the story of the power of the human will, the unfairness of
the world, the courage it takes to chase down your dreams. The themes and lessons it presents are valuable, and
I must admit I came out of it really motivated to go try out for the Wildcats. But its problems
are so distracting that it is often laughable. Besides its overt sentimentality, Rudy’s problem is that too much plot is
crammed into too short a time. Each scene includes a major new development in the story, leaving no time for
any of the characters to act naturally, like real people. The dialogue is similarly lacking; the longest sentence to come
out of Rudy’s mouth is, “I can do it, coach, I know I can!” Yes, this is the football version
of “The Little Engine That Could.”

Also, the film achieves minimal characterization, to the point that everyone in it is a stock character. They include the
discouraging father, the meek mother, the supportive best friend, the jealous brother, the unfaithful girlfriend, and, of course, the kind
coach who sees something great in wormy little Rudy. Rudy himself really isn’t believable because he takes years of abuse
and discouragement and only once considers giving up. Because Rudy has no weaknesses save his background and his small size,
the conflicts which develop are almost exclusively external. These problems combine to make Rudy a failure. If you really want
to procrastinate, you’ve already seen Malice, and you wept when Punky Brewster’s dog got run over, you may want to
sit in on Rudy. Otherwise, wait a couple of weeks until it’s out on video.
