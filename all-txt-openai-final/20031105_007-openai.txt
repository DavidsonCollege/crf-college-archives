**SGA hits the right note with spirit effort**

Halfway through this semester, SGA set its goals for the year. A perennial favorite made the list once again: increase school spirit.

Toward that oft-unachieved end, SGA is organizing a spirit bus to the Nov. 24 UNC-Davidson game in Charlotte and recently began a campaign to revive the fight song and the alma mater.

Here in the Davidsonian office, we’ve been singing all night. Badly, to be sure, but singing nonetheless. We wholeheartedly commend SGA’s incentive-based effort to bring a tradition other than drinking back to campus.

Of course, as many have already noted, the fight song is not exactly Grammy-winning material. The Davidsonian, therefore, invites everyone in the community to submit ideas for a new fight song. Send us your lyrics and identify the tune they’re set to.

We’ll print submissions in an upcoming issue, and the author of the best song will get a prize.

In the meantime, keep practicing the original—basketball season is just around the corner.

**Fight Song**

O Davidson! You are the best old College in the east or west;

You play a fair game, you play a square game, and you win in everything—

And when the Red and Black machine is out to fight and looking mean—

Then I am happy as for you I sing.

(Chorus) O’ Davidson! We will down them, down them everyone;

Come Davidson, we will conquer ere the day is done.

Down [opposing team] as through their lines we run;

Win for the honor of old Davidson.

**Alma Mater**

All hail, O Davidson, Our dear old Alma Mater,  
Thy Founders loved thee, gave their best to thee;  
We still today thy loyal sons and daughters,  
Follow them on and pledge our loyalty.

All hail, O Davidson, Thy classic halls are standing,  
Strong as the faith of those who founded thee,  
Casting their spell upon thy sons and daughters,  
Holding their hearts in faith and loyalty.

All hail! O Davidson, Thy storied years behind thee,  
Still pressing on to glories yet to be;  
Thy faithful sons and daughters stand before thee,  
Our voice raise in hymns of loyalty.

**News media focuses on wrong issues**

Dan Troy largely misses the point in his column “Fox News Haters Beware (Oct. 29, Perspectives).”

For some time there has been an intense debate about the bias in the media, from both the right and the left. But the more important question is whether or not the media, especially private for-profit media, are providing the public with educational content and diverse viewpoints. On both counts, they are failing.

Despite the vast array of choices that exist, most Americans get the majority of their news information from TV and radio. Therefore, the programming of those channels must be high. The fact that people choose conservative news outlets (or liberal ones) does not prove that the state of the media is good. Educating and encouraging a critical eye are what the media’s job is, and it is clearly failing to deliver.

The Iraq war provides us with a good example of our media problems.

One can disagree about Saddam Hussein’s precise connections to al-Qaeda or if Iraq possessed large quantities of weapons of mass destruction, but both conclusions are highly in doubt at this point.

Yet two-thirds of the American people believe that Saddam Hussein was personally involved in 9/11 and no one prior to the war dared to suggest that there might be no WMDs.

The fact that so many people held suspect viewpoints shows that the media fails to foster a critical perspective on crucial national issues.

Americans tend to know more about “Survivor” or the newest mass murder in Texas than about either their own communities or foreign affairs.

The reason for this is that our media is increasingly driven by a concern with profit to the detriment of education.

An ever-shrinking clique of large firms (GE, AOL Time Warner, Viacom, the News Corporation, Disney, for example) own the majority of our television and radio stations. In a bid to win larger market share, advertising and cost-cutting become these firms’ first concern.

Already known for poor international coverage, companies have cut their budgets for real investigative journalism in favor of cheaper crime stories. Prime Time hours feature Joe Millionaire or shock jocks in place of educational programming.

The “product” of poor media has sown a large amount of distrust in the media itself.

The outcry provoked by a recent Federal Communications Commission decision to further reduce controls on media ownership shows that many people understand how poor the media is and want things to change.

Our country will be better off if they can figure out a better way of doing things.
