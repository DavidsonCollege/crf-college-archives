Good afternoon. Our lead story this week — In a scene described by Campus Police Chief Jackie “D.D.” Hughes as
“shockingly, disgustingly violent,” the ATO House was brutally murdered last Wednesday night. Hughes has declined to name any suspects, but
ATAGD reporters have learned from Student Security Liaison Jim Mashburn thatthe Commons is “right at the top of the list.”
Our reporters talked to Commons director Carlton Pritchard, who claims that he has “nothing to hide,” and has gone so
far as to offer food and shelter at the Commons to ATO family members during their time of bereavement. “We
don’t want this to be seen as an admission of guilt, but we could certainly accommodate them.” Pritchard declined to
comment further.

In a related story, a cliché was found viciously dismembered on the front page of the 9/23 issue of the
Davidsonian. Jeff Tilbury, the first EMT to arrive at the scene, reported that the cliché “marching to the beat of
a different drummer,” was barely recognizable. “Beating to a different drummer, indeed!” cried Tilbury. “How could somebody butcher such a
beautiful cliché?” Dean Terry has been charged with aggravated assault on a cliché with intent to kill in connection with
the incident, and is being held without bond in the Davidson Town Jail.

News Shorts:
Unforced Sex Rate Lower
While nearly one out of every six male students have admitted to forcing women to have sex with them, the
other five claimed that “we don’t get any [sex] at all.” Moreover, 20 percent of the female students said they
have been forced to have sex even though they objected, whereas the other 80 percent said that their mothers had
told them that sex was dirty, and that the thought of doing “that” with a guy “really, like, ya know,
grosses us out, ya know, like, to the MAX!” A Davidson official who asked not to be named called the
findings “surprising and distressing.”

Staley Lecturer Named
Three people care. Some woman who’s written lots of books about women, God, and homos will lecture here.

Our final story today — freshmen, it’s your last night to drink! Better enjoy it. Be sure and get to
Food Lion before the witching hour.
