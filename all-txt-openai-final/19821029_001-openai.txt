**What Will Change?**

**Faculty Approves Semesters**

By DAVID RESNIK '85

The Davidson faculty approved an amended version of the semester proposal by a 60-33 vote at their 19 October meeting.

The revised proposal maintains the graduation requirement of thirty-six courses, the “normal” teaching load of six courses per year, and
six credits for requiring that the proposal not be implemented before the 1984-85 school year.

The faculty has referred the actual calendar to the Executive Committee and the daily schedule to the Educational Policies Committee
for further adjustments.

According to College President Samuel Spencer, “The proposal is passed, though the date of implementation is still uncertain.”

Semester Planning Committee chairman Sam Maloney is “pleased” with the faculty’s decision. After the meeting, he says he “felt like
a midwife, helping in the birthing of something the faculty was willing to deliver.” Maloney regrets that “it will be
uncomfortable to have a lame duck year [the year before transition]” and would like to see the proposal implemented sooner.

Student Government Association President Tim Johnston is still “not satisfied” with the proposal “as it is now.” According to Johnston,
the proposal would overburden science majors. Courses would not be on a fair parallel with other schools. He recommends that
lab courses above the 021 level count for one-and-a-half credits. “As it [the proposal] is fine-tuned,” says Johnston, “I will
go to bat for science majors.”

Johnston believes that adding a credit-hours system to the Semester Proposal might alleviate the Science Department’s problems.

The SGA appointed a committee to study the addition of a credit-hours system to the Semester proposal at its Executive
Council meeting this Wednesday.

**Humanities Predict Smooth Transition**

BY ROXANNA GUILFORD '85

For most of the disciplines in the humanities, the transition to the semester system will be a smooth one. Although
none of these departments have officially re-evaluated their course offerings, few professors anticipate any major curriculum changes.

One of the areas least affected by the switch is the Humanities program. According to Religion Professor Sam Maloney, “It’s
business as usual, meeting five days a week.” While admitting there is some question about the credit Humanities students will
receive, Dr. Maloney does not see this as a serious drawback.

The only possible disadvantage, concedes Dr. Maloney, is that “under the semester calendar, there will be just 140 class meetings
as opposed to 150.” He does not view this as a major problem, however, for “Humanities at Davidson was born
under the semester system.”

**Sciences Bemoan Physical Inflexibilities**

BY TOM SCHILLING '85

The Biology and Chemistry Departments have expressed conflicting reactions to the semester proposal.

Biology department chairman John Williamson believes that the proposal will require a “complete rethinking of departmental offerings” as far as
“time schedules, material, and major requirements.” Although he sees “real costs” in changing, he also feels that making each department
rethink its program could be good.

Williamson personally thinks that the semester system is “probably a better learning system” and that students, over a semester, can
“have time to mature in the subject.” He adds that the Biology department will not have too much trouble adjusting
to the new system with “not too much constriction of lab space.”

Associate Dean of the Faculty and Chemistry department chairman J.N. Burnett also sees a complete change in his department. He
does not share the same optimism toward adjustment that Professor Williamson has.

“Our physical plant is perfect for the system we have now,” Burnett says. Some courses may have to be cancelled
in order to make more lab space for other courses. Chemistry 021, a course “taken by half the students who
graduate from Davidson,” will have to be eliminated to provide lab space for other courses, according to Burnett.

He adds that this will prevent non-science majors from experiencing a laboratory science.

Burnett says that another problem with adjustment is that “Chemistry majors needing certification by the American Chemical Society will not
be able to get the needed lab time” as well as other requirements.

Dr. Maloney is confident that the return will be easy.

Speaking for his department as a whole, Dr. Maloney asserts, “We won't have a problem as a department.” He anticipates
no changes in either course offerings or major requirements. Philosophy Professor Robert Maydole shares this sentiment. “We won’t need to
make much change.” He predicts that the department will continue to offer the same courses and maintain the same major
requirements. He does, however, see the new system as a “chance to offer more seminar-type courses.”

English Department Chairman Dr. Gil Holland also sees the calendar change as an opportunity for more in-depth study. “I hope
that this [the semester system] will enable us to offer more advanced courses and seminars.” On the whole, Dr. Holland
anticipates no significant adjustments in the English department’s curriculum. He believes, however, that the extra time will strengthen such existing
areas as composition and research.

The semester system is a “real plus” for the political science department, according to Professor Thomas Kazee. He, too, sees
research projects benefitting from the additional time. Dr. Kazee sees an advantage for the student interested in internships, because many
of these programs, like the Washington Center for Learning Alternatives, are more feasible under a semester plan. Otherwise, Dr. Kazee
predicts “very few changes in our department. It is unlikely that any courses will be changed.” Likewise, the department has
made no plans to change the major requirements.

Professor Malcolm Partin has a similar view.
