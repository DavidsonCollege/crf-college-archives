#### Harmon and Engell enlighten with their poetry
By JIM DILLON

William Harmon once wrote a one-line poem about a visit to a rural North Carolina store: "Roses is full of geeks, I feel right at home." Yes, that’s a comma splice, and yes, it’s very indicative of Harmon’s style as a poet. He does not follow the rules, and he does not answer questions.

“People ask me silly questions like, ‘Are you kidding?’” he said. “People who answer questions are like people who floss their teeth too much or wear seatbelts. They're just asking for trouble.”

Harmon is a professor of English and former chair of the department at UNC-Chapel Hill. He received the 1970 Lamont Poetry Award and the 1985 William Carlos Williams Poetry Award. Monday night he gave a reading of his work sponsored by the Union Literary Arts Committee following a reading by Davidson professor John Engell.

Harmon’s style of poetry is very prose-like. Those present at the reading actually heard very little of his work. Harmon insisted that “no one should have to listen to poetry for more than an hour,” following forty minutes of reading by Engell.

Harmon was constantly interrupting his work, saying things like “Someone actually asked me that,” “I wrote this last month,” and “I didn’t read that right.” To one student laughing audibly in the front row he asked, “Can I take you home?”

Harmon is a Southern writer. He was born in Concord, North Carolina and, although he earned degrees from the Universities of Chicago and Cincinnati, he returned to Chapel Hill where he received a master’s degree. His writing exhibits a flair for the South, such as capturing detailed descriptions of the music on radio stations on a trip from North Carolina to Texas. He often seemed extremely sarcastic, but it was sarcasm that generated laughs from the audience. None was meant to offend.

Harmon’s always humorous style contrasted with that of Engell, who read a collection of poems he had dedicated to his son Fredrick, now two years old. Engell said he originally attempted to keep a journal for his son, but that attempt failed.

#### Pianist Jose Feghali
By MARK SWIFT

Jose Feghali, who performed in Love Auditorium last Thursday night as part of the Artist Series, provided a rare treat for the audience. His pianism was exciting and innovative; his style unique, especially considering his youth. The selection of music showed courage on his part. Because of its popularity among recording artists, we have, perhaps, seen a future master of the piano, one who may emerge in the years ahead as an equal to Van Cliburn, Ashkenazy, Rudolph Serkin, or Glenn Gould.

Feghali, who is only twenty-five years old, rose to international fame in 1985 when he won the International Van Cliburn Competition, founded and named after a pianist who won the first Tchaikovsky Piano Competition in 1958. The Tchaikovsky Competition held in Moscow and the Van Cliburn Competition held in Fort Worth, Texas, are usually considered to be the two most prestigious competitions in the world. Feghali, therefore, achieved almost instant fame after winning first prize.

Jose Feghali is a native Brazilian, but has lived and studied in London for over ten years with Maria Curcio, one of the greatest teachers living. His style, as was apparent to the audience, was bold and distinctive. This boldness was evident in his actual technique, which was more wrist-oriented than most pianists. Also, his interpretations of the music were stamped with his personal signature, most evident in his sudden changes in dynamics and tempo.

#### Gospel choir celebrates Martin Luther King Jr.
By MARK CHEN

Perhaps the best cultural event this school year came to Love Auditorium Sunday. It was the Gospel Choir Celebration held to honor Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday. Seven gospel choirs, five performers from Davidson College, both chaplains, President Kuykendall, and people of all races came together for two and a half hours to celebrate Dr. King. The assembly also revealed some of the meaning behind Dr. King’s life.

Though Dr. King had his greatest impact in the political struggle for civil rights, the celebration itself went back to his roots. It was held as a church service of the entire community. Brenda Tapia, the Assistant Chaplain, gave the Call to Worship. Chaplain Summers followed with the Invocation. Both of them emphasized that King’s religious beliefs were integral to his political world. The meaning of his life was in his political fight for the poor and the oppressed.

Of course, this is the most controversial legacy of King’s life. Some today use his mixture of religion and politics to criticize King, while others use him as the justification for their own efforts. On one side exists the liberation theologians, on the other the religious right. Radicals say he did not go far enough in his crusade, while Jesse Helms would say that he went altogether too far. If the meaning of King’s life is in his political involvement, then it is not one to which all people can agree.

The gospel choirs offered another meaning to King’s life. While King had graduate and doctoral degrees in systematic theology, he quoted the New Testament and returned to his most basic beliefs for strength. The call to action of his religious beliefs in a political world was a central theme of the celebration.Decided to write a monthly (with exceptions) poem of 34 lines in “loose pentameter” utilizing Matthew Arnold’s “simplicity of style” for his son. His poetry was written, he said, to his son but also to a wider audience. The speaker in the poem, he says, “is quite definitely me.” His poems recount some quite normal tasks of fatherhood such as “Feeding Him” and “Putting Him to Bed,” but also have somewhat philosophical implications that extend from the stories of his “elegant and difficult child.”

Engell insisted that he is not a poet. He has written “a bunch of critical stuff,” five plays, and “a whole lot of short stories” but relatively few poems. The group of poems dedicated to his son is his first collection.

Feghali gives memorable performance changes from loud to soft and his frequent use of rubato, or freedom with tempo changes not shown in music. Perhaps Feghali’s affinity for providing an entertaining and somewhat unusual interpretation of the music was because of the nature of the performance. The atmosphere of a competition is much more rigid than a recital for a paying audience. The Davidson recital, falling in the latter category, provided Feghali with a more relaxed atmosphere in which he could test fresh, even controversial, interpretations of a more intensely personal, passionate nature.

The program, which consisted of a J. S. Bach Partita, Beethoven’s “Appassionata” Sonata, Debussy’s Suite Bergamesque, and Prokofiev’s Sonata No. 7, as well as an encore by Heitor Villa-Lobos (a Brazilian composer), was not an easy recital to play successfully. The Beethoven and Debussy (which contains “Clair de Lune”) are instantly recognized by almost anyone with classical musical tastes or piano experience of more than five years. Some people in the audience, uninterested in the freshness of a live performance and new interpretations, may have reacted negatively to Feghali’s concert because of this recognizability. Unfortunately, the familiarity of recorded versions of this music can bias an audience towards one unchanging performance. Feghali showed his self-confidence and desire for creative interpretation even when choosing his recital program.

Personally, I found the Bach exciting, the Beethoven captivating, the Debussy relaxing (perhaps too much so), and the Prokofiev on the verge of being spectacular. Regrettably, the Steinway piano in Love Auditorium is shallow and inconsistent in brightness among its “tessituras,” and I have a great deal of respect for any pianist who dares attempt a formal recital on the instrument. Jose Feghali is a gifted pianist who will probably make his mark in the musical world. Despite the large number of pianists found at Davidson College and in the community, surprisingly few pianists are invited to perform in the Artist Series. The last was Claude Frank in early 1984.

Luther King Day

Reeves Temple A.M.E. Zion and Torrence Chapel Spiritualaires. One choir, the W.E. Beeman Angelic Gospel Singers, had made the four-hour drive from Fayetteville to be there. Davidson students also participated in the program. Days before the celebration, a blues singer and activist with Dr. King had died. His place in the program was taken by Jackie Daughtery and Muadi Mukenge. Daughtery gave the last sermon King preached before his death, while Mukenge accompanied her on the clarinet. The sermon, as if he had known beforehand, talked about what King wanted to be remembered about his life. It too, emphasized that he had worked for the poor and the oppressed in the name of Christ. It spoke in a simple yet eloquent language.

Melissa Givens and Mark Swift also took part in the service. While Swift played the piano, Givens sang “A Long Way from Home.” Her voice was beautiful and richly expressive. President Kuykendall had to speak after her and painfully noted the fact. He said that “anyone who follows Melissa Givens is a fool.” But he also spoke of being there in Memphis and the march back to Atlanta after King’s death. Many people had been together with the same grief. Dee Perry accompanied two of the choirs on the piano. Finally came the closing hymn and the benediction. For a few minutes, I talked with Wayne Williams after the service. He had been the first to suggest a gospel choir to Charlie Summers and had organized the event. Though happy with how it had turned out, he wished that more students had come. I agreed, and then thanked him for his suggestion. The rain was still coming down and it was still winter term, but the warmth from the celebration carried over.
