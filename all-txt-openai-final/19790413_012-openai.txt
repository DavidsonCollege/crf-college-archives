Reynolds lecturer Canon Carr to

The Reverend Canon Burgess Carr, Reynolds Lecturer, will be on campus April 18-19, 1979.

Canon Carr serves as the General Secretary of the All Africa Conference of Churches. Born in Liberia, Canon Carr graduated from Cuttington College and Divinity School in Liberia and later received his Masters of Theology at Harvard.

Carr conducted the negotiations ending the seventeen-year civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Sudan, and he has addressed the Security Council of the United Nations three times on African political affairs. He was also a Fellow at the Center for International Affairs at Harvard. His present position at Harvard is Visiting Lecturer in Ecumenical Relations.

Long active in African theological and political affairs, Canon Carr describes himself as a “Pan-Africanist whose political consciousness was shaped in the heyday of the nationalist struggle for African independence and unity.... Consequently, I believe in sparing no effort to help build a humane, just, and united Africa by overcoming all those forces that generate dissension, strife, and human anguish. This is the reason why I have been so forceful in denouncing Human Rights violations in independent African nations.”

While at Davidson, Canon Carr will lecture on five topics as follows:

April 18, 10 am—“Human Rights Violations in Africa,” Chambers Gallery.
April 18, 12:30 p.m.—Open Luncheon with “Race Relations in Africa,” 900 Room.
April 18, 8 pm—“Christianity and Politics in Africa,” 900 Room.
April 19, 10 am—“Disinvestment in South Africa,” Chambers Gallery.
April 19, 8 pm—“The Content and Context of African Theology,” 900 Room.

Doug Soloman to recount China trip

By ANN TUTWILER
Staff Writer

“When we left for China on December 15, we did not know of President Carter’s decision to ‘normalize’ relations with the mainland. We were constantly reminded (and toasted) by our hosts as ‘the first group to visit them since normalization.’” Doug Soloman, leader of that first group, is currently an Academic Advisor at the University of Pittsburgh. He holds a Masters Degree in East Asian Studies and speaks fluent Mandarin Chinese. Professor Soloman will present a short talk and his slides from his trip Friday at 10 am in the Morrison Room. Pastry, juice, and coffee will be served at a cost of 25 cents.

A different and delicious approach to eating today.
