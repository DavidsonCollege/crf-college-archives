Part two will include selections by the K. K. K. and Sophomore quartets with a main feature in a monologue
by the inevitable black-face fun producer, A. M. Martin. Martin's negro sermons have never failed to bring down the house
and his negroid oratory will add a distinctive feature to the program.

for this comedy will be as follows:
- Wilpomoke J. Pashby—C. F. Smith.
- Battlin’ Bimbo—J. A. Joyner.

that Milhous has probably reached the heights. He is a member of the Kappa Alpha Fraternity.

Nick Sappenfield, president-elect of the Davidson Student Body, is perhaps the leading man of the rising Senior class. As quarterback
on the 1924 Wildcat eleven, he directed the attack of the best team in many years. Sappenfield also plays scrub
baseball and basketball and is noted in all athletics as one of the cleanest of the Davidson players. Nick is
a member of the Phi Gamma Delta Fraternity.

He was practically sure of a “D” in track until a case of mumps knocked him out. He is an
honor roll man, a prominent officer in the International Relations Club—being vice-president of the national organization. He is a member
of Alpha Phi Epsilon debating fraternity and a recent electee to Sigma Upsilon.

Frederick Smith is the leading man on the campus along journalistic lines, recently elected editor-in-chief of The Davidsonian. He was
on Quips and Cranks staff and contributor to the Magazine. He has had several plays presented by the Dramatic Club.
D. B. Wharton concluded the “Study of the Unconscious” with the labors of the Sophists.

The selection of each of the students to O. D. K. came as a fitting reward to three years of
prominence at Davidson.

James F. Milhous of Martin Station, Ala., is the most prominent debater in his class, having made teams in the
last two years. It was through his great work that Davidson won out over Washington and Lee last year.
