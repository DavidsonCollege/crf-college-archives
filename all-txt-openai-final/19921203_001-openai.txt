**Homeward Bound ‘Cats Back in Davidson For Final Four**

**Wildcat Victories Electrify Campus**

By Alex Crumbley

The varsity men’s soccer team has advanced to the NCAA Final Four, and the entire college is responding. From students
to professors to administrators, everyone at Davidson has become imbued with school spirit. Strong consistent game attendance throughout the year
indicates that support for the ‘Cats is not merely fair-weather, but recent success has won new soccer fans and bolstered
existing support. The team has also risen to national prominence with articles in the New York Times and a report
to be aired on National Public Radio’s All Things Considered Friday morning. Coach Charlie Slagle was interviewed by an NPR
reporter Wednesday afternoon for the Friday report. Junior soccer player Ben Hayes and Slagle will also be on WRFX’s "John
Boy and Billy" show on Friday morning.

After Sunday’s thrilling 1-0 victory over N.C. State propelled the Cats into the semifinals, Davidson students began to prepare for
an experience they never dreamed they would have: hosting their own team in the soccer championships. Upon their defeat of
the Wolfpack, Davidson received 250 more tickets for the tournament. After giving some to players and coaches, 150 tickets went
on sale Monday morning at 7:30 AM and all sold out within forty-five minutes. About thirty students camped out in
Baker Sports Complex on Sunday night to ensure their chances of getting a seat. Kelly Thompson, one excited student who
spent the night in Baker, said, “The soccer team has given students something to get behind and a chance to
show off how supportive we are [of Davidson athletics].”

The players’ parents have definitely noticed the increased enthusiasm.

**Students Upset Over Exam Changes**

**Self-Scheduled Period Shortened to 5 Days**

By Mandy Curtis

The 1992 fall exam period, a changed schedule from past years, has sparked confusion and concern among many students at
Davidson. This year’s calendar includes new “optional class days” and an exam period shortened to five days. The changes are
results of an evolutionary process that began four years ago.

Davidson switched from trimesters to semesters for the ‘88-‘89 school year. The different semester system necessitated a change in exam
schedules. The Executive Committee of the Faculty, consisting of seven faculty members and three administrators, determined the calendar for that
year as well as years since. In that first year, students were given seven days for exams in the fall
and six and a half days in the spring. In ‘89-‘90 and ‘90-‘91 the exam schedule was changed to six
and a half days for exams in both the fall and spring semesters. After classes ended, there was the traditional
reading day, and exams began the next day. The exam period was reduced again last year to five and a
half days with a reading day. In the current academic year, there are only five days for exams.

According to Dr. Benjamin Klein, the Acting Dean ofHere is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

Faculty and a member of the Executive Committee of the Faculty, the committee “didn’t know what to expect” in the
first year of the semester change. The committee felt that they wanted to give the students “an adequate amount of
time” for exams, but as the years went along the committee had more experience and realized that “less time was
needed.” “It is clear that the feeling [of the committee] is that five days is enough,” stated Klein. Back in
the years when there were seven or six and a half days for exams, there were still seniors around who
needed to fulfill the requirement of 35 courses for graduation. According to Klein, because many of those students still had
five classes a semester, the committee allowed for the extended number of exam days. Now there is “virtually no one
who has five exams,” said Klein. Klein went on to explain that convenience and monetary interests are the two main
concerns in making the calendar and exam schedule. “It is a perceived desire of the students that they want to
get home for Christmas; however, we want them to do well on their exams,” said Klein. Economically, the more days
there are of exams the longer the dorms need to stay open and the meals need to be served, according
to Klein. Optional class days are a new addition to this year’s calendar.

Ukrop's Triple OT Goal Beats N.C. State

By Bruce Balestier

The Davidson soccer team completed what is likely the longest path ever taken to the NCAA Soccer Tournament’s Final Four
Sunday afternoon in Raleigh with a 1-0 win over #3 N.C. State. The win over the Wolfpack took the better
part of three overtime periods, but was a comparative relief after games in the first two rounds of the tournament,
against UNC-Charlotte and Coastal Carolina, in to decide the outcome after 90 minutes of regulation and 60 minutes of overtime
produced a tie score. Davidson (17-4-5) will meet San Diego (18-4) in the second semifinal game Friday afternoon at Richardson
Field. The game-winning goal came at 131:47 and culminated a prolonged assault by the Wildcats on the N.C. State goal
in the first sudden-death overtime period. Matt Spear’s free kick from the right corner of the field deflected off a
couple of players in a clump in front of the goal and bounced to Rob Ukrop, who sent it into
the net with a low shot from five yards out, then took off at a full sprint to meet a
swarm of Davidson fans who vaulted a fence to join the players in an on-field celebration. “The ball just dropped
right there,” said Ukrop, “and I just hit it as hard as I could on the ground.” It was an
improbable conclusion to the game for Ukrop, who eluded a crowd of N.C. State defenders for what seemed like the
first time all afternoon. Wolfpack coach George Tarantini, figuring that Davidson could not win if Ukrop was not a factor,
assigned two, and sometimes three, defenders to mark him constantly, and that strategy held Ukrop, the nation’s leading scorer with
31 goals and 72 points, to just two.
