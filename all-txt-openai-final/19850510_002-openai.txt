#### Student Recognized For Outstanding Contributions

Davidson students are active in many areas of community service and concern. Most people are active within a college organization,
and outstanding contributions to those organizations are recognized by the College community. Recently, a Davidson student was recognized for her
contributions outside of the college campus.

Senior Nancy Rosselot has been named “Brownie Troop Leader of the Year” by the Hornet’s Nest Council of the Girl
Scouts of America. The council covers an eight-county area. Nancy started working with the Davidson Brownie Troop her sophomore year.
Her troop provides much of the campus with Girl Scout cookies each year, and their float won first place in
the Davidson Town Day parade this year.

Judy Redd strengthened the Girl Scouting program in Davidson this year by starting a Junior troop for girls who are
older than the Brownies. Both women were recognized for the impact they have made on the scouting program for girls
in the Davidson community.
