Three Egrets

1.

Three egrets lie in the grass
taking the morning sun,
while nursemaids roll
their strollers by
and babies cry
pointing their fingers
at the snow white birds.

2.

Three egrets huddle in the islandâ€™s shade
behind the willow tree
watching the skipping stones
of schoolboys
sink in the smooth water.

3.

Three egrets fly to the willow tree
craning their necks to the west.
And the lovers
with interlocking fingers
pause
to watch the setting sun.

4.

Three egrets sleep in the willow tree
one above and two below
while the lovers wait
on the damp grass
for darkness to fall.
