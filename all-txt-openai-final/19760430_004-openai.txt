**The Circulating Fear**

"While certain rights are granted to students under law, the law is not always clear in respect to these rights, especially in the case of private institutions."

"Legalism! Legalism!" cries the insulted professor reading the Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities. "Legalism undermines the basic person-to-person trust that Davidson has valued for so long. The students don’t trust us anymore and if this document passes we'll all wind up in the courts arguing about unfair and capricious grading!"

A student passing by this professor's door stops and listens. He hears the professor and begins to wonder where things got so out of control. He reflects on his relationship to the faculty. Frankly, it would never enter his head to take a professor to court. The student curses the Governance Subcommittee that wrote/is re-writing the statement of rights. Apparently, what seemed like a fairly harmless document stating some rights he already thought he had was turning out to be a violation of the ideals Davidson holds most dear. Apparently, it was sending students and faculty to their respective foxholes to do battle, each side frantically dragging with it any artillery it could lay its hands on.

What was happening? Up until this point, the student did not know that there were sides to be taken. He had always thought of professors as over-grown students who got paid for being academicians. Apparently, this was not the case. Professors were different from students, and now that difference caused them to hole up in their offices and worry about what students were going to do to them.

The situation which now exists in some minds, that which has students writing new drafts of Article 12, throwing them at the faculty and then running for cover, is greatly exaggerated. But the fact that any situation exists that can be inflated into this exaggeration is tragic. In a real sense, someone has got to start trusting soon or the inflated problem will blow up in our faces.

We believe that the current draft of Article 12 was presented by students to the faculty in good faith. It was not designed to be something that students continually tested to see if it was true. Rather, it was a statement of something students believed to be true already. Probably, it was an imperfect affirmation of these truths. The new draft will be better. We hope that students and faculty will benefit from the interaction involved with creating the new draft. It is the realization that the Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities cannot create person-to-person trust and that no one intends for it to undermine the already existent trust that must carry us through. Come out. The war is over.

The following passage is taken from a book published by the National Administrative Office of the Kappa Alpha Order, entitled *Pledge Education for Initiation into Kappa Alpha Order* (pp. 62-63):

"Kappa Alpha Order is southern in origin, but it is not sectional..."

Yearly subscription rate: $6.00.a significant sense wherein its essential teachings are for its members to cherish the ideal of character and attributes of the true gentleman... We would remind each (pledge) brother that his actions on the campus and elsewhere reflect on the entire Order and the active chapter which has chosen him.” The Kappa Alpha chapter at Davidson is indeed distinguished from the other fraternities by this emphasis on the South and the southern gentleman, the epitome of which is Robert E. Lee. I understand that in past years the chapter at Davidson has been reputed to have carried certain southern emphases to an extreme; it has been accused of “southern extremism” (I use this term for lack of a more appropriate one) and, to some extent, racial prejudice. I also understand that in the past few years the chapter has become aware of these opinions and accusations and has sought to refute them verbally and by its actions. There may have been such attempts made and some of them may have been successful. But, any successes that may have been made have now, in my opinion, been effaced by Old South 1976. I am referring to the square dance held on the night of the twenty-third where the pledges were required to blacken their faces. The decision in favor of the blackening of the pledges’ faces was reached by a vote taken by the brothers in the house. There was a diversity of opinion on the issue, but those having doubts were reassured that there were no racial connotations—in reenacting the “drama” of the Old South the pledges would merely be playing a role, so to speak. I have talked to a few pledges and some of them did have definitely mixed emotions concerning this decision; a few pledges mentioned their reservations to the brothers, but some didn’t because I gather they felt a certain pressure to conform. This pressure was probably caused by the pledges’ realization that somehow, as pledges, they had to be separated or set apart from the other brothers—the blackening of their faces was supposedly used as this separating factor. I do not understand this pressure for I am not involved in a sorority or any other organization of this sort. But, I think I may understand the feelings of those pledges and brothers who did have doubts on the matter. Undoubtedly, one wants to become initiated with as little harassment as possible. Therefore, I am not writing to promote my moral views. I cannot in complete fairness publicly pass moral judgment on the pledges who blackened their faces or on those who made the ruling for them to do so. But, I can and do accuse the KA’s of a grave mistake in judgment. In their enthusiasm, they probably did not consider the impact of their decision. If, indeed, there are efforts to remove the label of prejudice formerly applied to them, and if there was no prejudice involved in the making of the decision, the decision itself seems to deny these allegations. Upon learning of the decision, my initial reaction was one of dismay. I was assured that there was no prejudice on the part of the brothers so I can only assume that this is true. But, judging from the strength of my own reactions I think it safe to assume that others share my feelings. It must be admitted that Friday night’s events could be interpreted as being racially prejudiced and undignifying. Indeed, similar actions (not necessarily those of KA) have rightly been so judged in the past. Who is to know that this event is different? Again, I am not passing moral judgment. My only comment is that if the KA's are concerned about their reputation, they should be reminded that their actions “on the campus and elsewhere reflect on the entire Order and the active chapter.” In other words, I would seriously urge the KA's to consider the implications of their decisions and to endeavor to employ better, more thoughtful judgment in the future.
