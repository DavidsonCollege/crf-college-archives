**Students Decide** (Continued from page 1)

... to one of these two projects, with the possibility of donating to both also open. A project called CROP has begun the idea of “food for work.” This program helps villagers and farmers complete the projects essential to their community and economic development, while it distributes food essential to their survival not as a dole but as a wage. CROP is neither a foundation nor a government agency. CROP is an organization of people who want to give others a chance for a change. One way of providing that change is through agribusiness: giving seed, fertilizer, tools, and other items. It is possible for donors to ...

**Dorm** (Continued from page 1)

According to Nicholls, there is still another pressing question concerning housing which must be answered. “I just don’t know where we are going to house all of the students.” This situation, coupled with the fact that the attrition rate here at Davidson is quite low, means several students who had planned to live off-campus next year have already decided that such an arrangement is not as desirable as they had once thought. 

... designate how funds they donate are to be used. The Davidson-Cornelius Day Care Center is a non-profit organization that has been serving the community for about five years. Until last year, the center was funded by the Social Services Department of the federal government, but when the Administration cut federal funds, it was decided North Mecklenburg’s poor did not qualify for this type of aid. The center is by no means a babysitting service. A qualified director and qualified teachers work on the staff, and about 40 2-5 year olds are enrolled in the program. Some two-thirds of the children at the center can’t ...

**Dilemma**

“One student told me that with the possibility of gas rationing, he did not want to be located out in Huntersville where he would have to drive.” Currently, there are about 205 students living off-campus. “If this number is reduced, we are going to be in a lot of trouble as far as accommodating students.” The eating houses can support a total of 15 students. Grey House lodges 14 students. Six students reside in the North Main House.

**Coleman To Speak On ‘Life’**

By CHARLIE SHEPHERD, Managing Editor

(Ed. note: the following article was derived from an article by Michael Putney which appeared in the National Observer.)

Many people have wished at one time or another that they could jump into a time machine and travel somewhere besides the mundane reality they are usually exposed to. In a sense, this is what President of Haverford College Jack Coleman has done. Coleman recently completed his sabbatical, which does not seem especially newsworthy, until one considers...siders that he spent the majority of it as a ditch digger in Atlanta, a sandwich-and-salad man at the famous Union Oyster House in Boston, and as a garbage man in the Maryland suburbs of Washington. The Davidson community has been provided with a rare opportunity to hear Coleman speak at 7 p.m. Dec. 9 in Chambers Banquet Hall. As one of a series of lecturers on various ‘life’ topics, he will speak on vocations. Coleman believes that one of the most frightening problems in America today is the widening gap between the country’s intellectual and working communities. He commented that the event which spurred this fright the most was the 1970 clash between hard hats and young people on Wall Street.

After working for a week on a friend's dairy farm in Ontario in order to get in shape, he set out for Atlanta where he secured a job as a ditch digger with hourly pay of $2.75. For the next two weeks, Coleman laid pipes, dug ditches, and kept a daily journal. He concluded that the so-called blue collar blues and the death of the work ethic had been over-emphasized. Next, Coleman traveled to Boston where he was hired as a porter-dishwasher (for $2 per hour) in a restaurant. However, he was promptly fired after an hour’s work, the manager explaining that it “was not his line of work.” The Haverford president finally secured a job after three days as a salad-and-sandwich maker in The Union Oyster House. In those three days of job hunting, he experienced something of the demoralization that takes place when one realizes that no one needs your skills. As his final experiment, Coleman traveled to Calverton, Md. where he worked as a garbage man. The suburbs he worked in were mostly white and middle-class. He experienced some of the problems which anger laborers.

Projects pay the full price of day care and because their family’s income exceeds the government’s poverty level they can get no federal assistance. In order to make up the money that parents can’t afford to pay, about $25,000 from community organizations is needed. Outside sources have been last year, but further monetary assistance is needed to keep the center open. One or both of these projects will be supported by the Christmas project. Solicitations will begin immediately following the S.G.A. elections on Tuesday.

SGA Candidates (Continued from page 3) each of the Classes of '75, '76, and ’77 will be selected. Candidates for the junior class are Jud Cuttino, Denson Hardgrove, Chip Jones, Rick Mullen, Bob Lautensack, Shaul Saddick, Phil Stykes, and John Walters. Candidates for the sophomore class include Bill Reed, Jim Deville, Scott Logan, Joel Tew, Willard Ross, Ken Bumgarner, Martin Eakes, John Doscher, Bruce Corser, Rick McKenzie, and Mark Firth. Candidates for the freshman class are Ernest Barry, Tony Snow, Deborah David, Alan Rockett, Sue Johnston, and Peyton Marshall. In other races, Bruce Corser ran unopposed for Co-Curricular Council Chairman, and DuBose Porter for Student Solicitor. Bob Corlew was unopposed for the office of Defense Advisor.

Davidson College NC PIRG will increase its board membership to ten in the upcoming elections. The new board will take office in the spring. If you have any questions concerning PIRG or its activities, stop by the PIRG desk in the upstairs of the Union in the afternoons from 2 to 4:30, or contact any board member.
