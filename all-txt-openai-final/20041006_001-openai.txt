VOLUME 96, NUMBER 6

Students turn out in large
numbers to watch debate

By BEN WHIGHAM
Senior Staff Writer

Students packed the 900 Room last
Thursday evening to watch the first
of three presidential debates this fall.

After the debate, students attended
a panel discussion in the Duke Fam-
ily Performance Hall.

Professor of Economics Vikram
Kumar, Professor of Philosophy
Lance Stell, and Professor of History
Ralph Levering were among those on
the panel.

The presidential debate was tightly
controlled and did not allow for di-
rect questioning between the candi-
dates.

The regulated debate was the prod-
uct of an agreement between the two
campaigns.

“The format of the debate will rely
on the candidate that wants the great-
est amount of restrictions,” said
Kumar.

Kumar also said that the format
might have practical purposes.

“If you have an open debate, you
might hit a new level of nuance that
the audience likes,” he said, “or you
might get a cat fight.”

Student reaction largely depended
on their political stance entering the
campaign.

College Republicans President
Joseph Adams ’06 credited Kerry
with a stylistic performance but
awarded Bush the overall advantage
in the first debate.

“Style went to Kerry, but substance
went to Bush,” said Adams.

Adams found a potential “fatal
error” in Kerry’s aggressive stances.

College seeks greater
religious diversity

By ZACH KAZIOR
News Editor

This Friday, the Executive Com-
mittee of the Board of Trustees will
present their recommendation to the
entire Board regarding whether or not
to maintain a requirement that all
members of the Board of Trustees be
“active members of a Christian
church.”

As the Trustees begin to deal with
this issue, some Davidson students
have looked to the College’s State-
ment of Purpose to see if we are ful-
filling our stated mission.

According to the College’s State-
ment of Purpose, “The loyalty of the
college thus extends beyond the
Christian community to the whole
human community and necessarily
includes an openness to and respect
for the world’s various religious tra-
ditions.”

Yet the recent scheduling of Home-
coming during the Jewish holiday of
Yom Kippur has called into question
Davidson’s commitment to the vari-
ous religious traditions represented
on campus.

Although many members of the
Davidson community felt this con-
flict was a blow to relations between
the college and religious minorities
on campus, most still believe the
college holds true to its Statement of
Purpose.

“It seems to me accurate to say that
Davidson has sought to encourage
religious diversity on campus, and to
provide support for student groups
of faith traditions other than Chris-
tian,” said College Chaplain Rob
Spach. “We clearly identify that we
are rooted in a particular theological
tradition, and articulate how that tra-
dition leads the college to have a
loyalty that extends beyond the
Christian community and engenders
a respect for and an openness to all
the world’s religious traditions.”

COMA
replaced
by DCC

By AUDRY BRACCO
Staff Writer

The executive board of the newly
formed Diversity Coordination
Council (DCC) held its first meeting
last Thursday.

The group discussed their current
agenda as well as the implementa-
tion of a new constitution.

The DCC, which serves as the
umbrella organization for all minor-
ity organizations on campus, will
replace the Committee on Minority
Affairs (COMA), which was created
in the early 1990s.

According to DCC Chair Hanako
Kawabata ’06, COMA was “created
to oversee and give a voice in the SGA
seat for all minority groups on cam-
pus.”

New York Times columnist and economist Paul
Krugman gave this year’s Wearn Lecture.

Krugman criticizes
Bush administration

By JACKIE MCKEOWN
Staff Writer

Princeton professor of economics
and New York Times columnist Paul
Krugman gave the Davidson College
Wearn Lecture in Duke Family Per-
formance Hall last Wednesday.

Krugman’s speech was a criticism
of the Bush administration’s foreign
and economic policies.

Krugman pointed out in the begin-
ning of his lecture that he did not
originally intend to write about poli-
tics. Krugman said that when the
New York Times approached him in
1999 about writing a column on in-
ternational trade and finance, poli-
tics was not included.

But the column evolved as
Krugman said he “gradually became
radicalized” due to what he believed
were troubling political events.

He argued that the government
exploited the September 11 terrorist
attacks and used it as an excuse to go
to war with Iraq.

Krugman said, “The towers were
still burning and they were saying,
‘How can we use this to go after
Saddam?’”

Krugman was also critical of the
Bush administration’s handling of
the war and its effects.

“The aid projects and post-conflict
efforts are not allowed to have any
input into policy,” he said.

Krugman favored invading Af-
ghanistan and felt “dismayed as they
lost interest.” The Bush
administration’s handling of Af-
ghanistan gave him a “bad feeling of
how they would handle the aftermath
in Iraq.”

Krugman addressed what he called
a lack of expertise in government
today.

“Everything is political,” he said.
“The experts are not allowed to have
input into policy.”
