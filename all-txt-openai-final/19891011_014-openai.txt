**Injuries take toll, Davidson drops three**

By GIGGY MAXWELL

**Fordham 14 - Davidson 12**

This was supposed to be the revenge game. Last year's Fordham-Davidson clash, which found the Wildcats at the short end
of a 9-3 final, was one of three key games that supposedly decided the division change issue in the minds
of Davidson trustees. It was a game in which the Wildcats had dominated statistically, yet couldn’t find the endzone.

One minute into the game Davidson was on its way to avenging this loss. DB Mike Noonan intercepted a Fordham
pass and returned it to the Ram 36-yard line. A penalty gave the Wildcats first and ten on Fordham’s 21.
Two minutes later a James Brown field goal gave Davidson a 3-0 lead. Before the quarter was over, Davidson had
put another field goal on the board behind the running of FB Brian Kelly, who broke free for a 48-yard
run during the drive.

Although leading by six points, the Wildcats’ first few possessions were telling. The offensive line was not opening holes consistently
for Wildcat running backs. Davidson’s defense was dominating the line but the offense continued the scoring drought that has plagued
it all season. Until late in the fourth quarter, Davidson’s offense could get no closer than the Fordham 37-yard line.

Despite these problems, Wildcat rushers still managed to grind out 230 yards on the day, with Brian Kelly’s 79 yards
leading the way. But with the passing attack completing only 4 of 16 passes, none in the first half, the
opposing defense could key on the rushers all day.

The Wildcats still could have emerged victorious had it not been for a key injury to DL Kenny Nazemetz late
in the first half. Up until that point Fordham’s main running back had accumulated only 31 yards on the ground.
In the second half, he scampered through Wildcat defenders for more than 80 yards. Behind this rejuvenated rushing attack, Fordham
scored late in the first half and again early in the fourth quarter. The 14-6 advantage proved too much for
the Wildcat offense to handle. A late score pulled the Wildcats to within two, but a failed two-point conversion and
on-side kick sealed Davidson’s fate.

**JC Smith 18 - Davidson 15**

As I stood on the sidelines on mud-infested Memorial Stadium, with 32 seconds remaining in the Wildcats’ game against the
Golden Bulls from Johnson C. Smith, the gears between my ears started turning. Two years ago the Wildcats had allowed
a last-minute touchdown to Catawba which spoiled their hopes for victory. Last season Davidson led ETSU in the fourth quarter
only to have a long kickoff return and subsequent touchdown ruin the day’s effort. Now leading 15-12, would history repeat
itself? It couldn’t. It wouldn’t dare.

The Wildcats’ own comeback had been too heroic. Two picture-perfect fourth-quarter scoring drives, the last one culminating in a 20-yard
touchdown pass from Peter Hughes to TE Tony Lambert which gave the ‘Cats their three-point lead. Tailback Ralph Isernia had
followed up his MVP performance in the Pride Bowl becoming the first Wildcat to break the century barrier in rushing
yards during a single game this season. Peter Hughes’s return to action after a hand injury saw him complete 8
of 14 water-logged passes for over 100 yards. The Wildcat defense did its part as well bringing J. C. Smith’s
star quarterback, Maurice Flowers, back down to earth as he tasted mud on several occasions. The Wildcats couldn’t lose.

32 seconds later I was engulfed by a silence that could be heard even over the roars of elated Johnson
C. Smith fans. A desperation pass from 20 yards out had bounced off one J.C. Smith receiver, after he had
been hit by DB Mike Noonan, into the hands of one of J.C. Smith’s blocking backs. His dive for the
ball carried him into the endzone. The clock read :00. The scoreboard, 18-15. Charlotte Observer columnist Tom Sorenson called the
game “the best in the Carolinas on Saturday, if not the world”. Somehow that didn’t make the outcome any easier
to swallow.

sey’s Pride Bowl festivities from taking place September 23. Unfortunately, the Wildcats wasted an M.V.P. effort from tailback-by-default Ralph Isernia,
and fell to a 1-2 record as 1987 Division III Champion Wagner College defeated Davidson 35-11 before a crowd of
7,200 in the Cats’ biggest test of the season to date. “When we scheduled the Dayton and Wagner games we
knew they would most likely be losses, but we at least expected to give them both a run for their
money,” said Gatto. Davidson’s next game is against Methodist on Saturday, Oct. 14, at 1:30. The game will be away
at Fayetteville.

Can’t help but notice those peppy ‘Cats...

By ROBERT GRUBB

Davidson’s first football victory in over a year gave fans something to cheer about last month at Richardson Field. But
the football team wasn’t the only thing that the students were yelling about. The much improved cheerleading squad transferred their
enthusiasm to the Davidson crowd.

“Having something to cheer about, like the football win, is important,” said Bob Price, assistant athletic director. “But I think
that the cheerleaders generated some of the excitement from their own enthusiasm.”

The members of this year’s squad are: Meredith Gabel, Tina Smith, LeAnn Simmons, Barbara Defenbaugh, Amy Norwood, Heather Hindsley, and
Michelle Green. Fans weren’t the only ones who got a boost from this enthusiastic cheerleading squad.

“It was fantastic to see the players’ faces when we got the crowd into the game,” said cheerleader Gabel. “The
crowd noise was a big change from last year—crowd noise always helps,” said defensive back Andy Hunt. “The cheerleaders have
put up banners and we've gotten a lot of support, which is a change from last year.”

The students’ excitement reflected improvements in this year’s cheerleading squad. Four of the seven cheerleaders returned from last year’s squad.
“Cheerleading is something that in the past people have participated in for one year and then quit,” said Gabel.

The cheerleaders have a larger group this year and have made changes. One addition is a “mike man.” Freshman Anthony
Fox led the students in cheers at the first game. The squad also implemented new cheers to get the students
involved.

“We have gone around to the Patterson Court houses to teach the fans new cheers, which they will have a
part in,” said Gabel. The cheerleaders have also put up banners before the games and on game day wore tee
shirts encouraging students to attend the game.

The squad has directly involved itself with the team. They passed out candy bags to the players for the trip
to Dayton two weeks ago. They have also made uniformed appearances at players’ breakfasts and alumni functions.

“They have really done things on their own, and with limited resources, which is a credit to the girls,” said
Price. “They have worked together to try different things to make spirit better. They have shown up at several events
where their attendance was not required. That kind of effort shows.”

Although much of the improvement is due to the girls’ own hard work and group effort, they have received guidance
and advice from Dana Leonard. Leonard, a local citizen, has offered her help as an informal advisor to the cheerleaders.
Leonard is a graduate of UNC-Chapel Hill, where she was a cheerleader.

“She has experience as a cheerleader and she can give the girls an objective outside opinion of their progress,” stated
Price. “It means a lot when someone not on the squad says, ‘Good job.’ Dana gives our cheerleaders some confidence
that they really are doing a good job.”

The cheerleaders realize the importance of having everyone enjoy themselves. “I think the fans really had a good time at
the Millsaps game,” said Defenbaugh. “It’s supposed to be fun. Even if we lose, if everyone gets together to support
their school they will have more fun, which is the whole point.”
