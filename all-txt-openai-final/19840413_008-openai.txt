**The Davidson Relays Track Squads Place 14th & 6th, Carter Jumps 6’8”**

By JEAN WEBB

Last Saturday, Davidson hosted the annual Davidson Relays track meet. With 27 teams participating, Davidson fared poorly in the team
standings, the women placing sixth out of seven teams, and the men 14th out of 19. While many Wildcats placed
individually in events, there were simply not enough Cats to spread around.

Junior Sarah Patterson placed fourth in the 5000-meter run with a time of 19:59.5 — a strong finish from a
runner with bronchitis. In the 3000 meters, junior Susie Dresser took fourth place in 11:34.19. The women’s distance-medley relay composed
of senior captain Sharon Bryant, junior Susie Myers, sophomore Judy Dalton, and Patterson finished in third place with a time
of 14:19.27. The 880 relay (Dalton, freshman Laeta Kalogridis, Myers, and Bryant) placed fifth in 2:01.83, and their mile relay
also took fifth with a time of 4:44. Furthermore, with 19 men’s teams competing Saturday, some of the women definitely
appeared to be faster off the track!

Appalachian State’s powerful women’s team won the meet handily, setting new meet records in the 400 intermediate hurdles, 440 relay,
100-meter dash, sprint-medley relay, mile relay, and javelin.

For the men’s team, sophomore Jay Brown placed fourth in the pole vault, jumping 13 feet. Junior Jeff Carter won
third place in the high jump with his most impressive jump of the season, 6’8”. The men of the 440
relay, sophomore Eric McClarty, junior Jim Walker, Brown, and senior Paul Fry, ran a speedy 00:44.34, but it only brought
them a sixth-place finish. The men’s 880 relay finished third (last) with 1:31.93. In the 10,000-meter run, senior David Teer
boasted a personal best time of 36:10, bettering his other runs by over a minute-and-a-half. For Teer, the other 10,000-meter
runners’ competition was too fierce for him to place. Brevard College’s Alphonse Swai, member of his African Olympic team, led
the way with a time of 30:19.57. Western Carolina beat the other men’s teams by a huge margin, setting a
new meet record in the 440 relay.

**Cats Drop Double Header To The Citadel**

By ANDY BARRON

Davidson lost a double header to The Citadel last Saturday but bounced back on Sunday to avoid a sweep. The
series left Davidson 9-12-1 for the season, and 4-8 in the conference.

The first game got off to a poor start for the Cats as The Citadel scored eight runs in the
first inning. Solid hitting by The Citadel and some Davidson errors made these runs possible. The fact that the first
four runs came on a grand slam only made things worse for the Cats. Freshman starter Billy Waitsman pitched only
two-thirds of an inning before being replaced by freshman Steve Condon. Waitsman, who is participating in both spring football and
baseball, had attended football practice the day before, which may have been a contributing factor in his short performance. Condon
gave a finedisplay of relief: pitching expertise. He struck out six of the first seven batters he faced, including the
first four. “Everything felt great,” Condon said. “I wish all my outings went that well.”

While Condon was stifling The Citadel, Davidson was fighting its way back into the game. Singles by sophomore Keith Helfant
and freshman Dave Turgeon, and a walk by sophomore Tim Waters, set up a grand slam by freshman Dave Kirby,
making the score 8-4. The Citadel scored two runs in the top of the fourth to take a 10-4 lead.
However, Turgeon responded with a home run in the bottom half of the inning to pull Davidson within five. Turgeon
leads the team with six homers this year.

The rest of the game consisted of Davidson being nickeled and dimed to death by The Citadel, finally losing 14-6.
Anyone who missed Saturday’s second game missed what was possibly the sloppiest no-hitter in baseball history. Unfortunately, Davidson was the
victim instead of the benefactor. The Citadel scored steadily through the game to win an ugly, though convincing, 9-0.

“I couldn’t believe that was a no-hitter,” said Condon. “Victory maybe, no-hitter, no way.”

“I’ve found no-hitters are more luck than anything, unless the pitcher really sticks it to you,” commented Coach George Greer.
“Since we got seven walks and were struck out only three times, I’d say we didn’t get it stuck to
us. We were hitting the ball. However, we were hitting it right at their fielders.”

The final game started out in an all-too-familiar way. The Citadel scored four runs in the first inning and the
Cats were once again behind before they had a chance to bat. Then sophomore starter Scott Weaver settled down, pitching
well, and Davidson started hitting. The first Davidson runs came in the bottom of the second when freshman catcher Dan
Simonds hit a two-out, bases-loaded single to score two runs. In the next inning, Davidson scored five runs, highlighted by
back-to-back doubles by freshmen Dave Depaul and Mark Thompson. Davidson scored one run in the fourth when Turgeon doubled and
came home on Waters’ single. Thompson provided what would turn out to be the winning runs with a two-run homer
in the fifth. Weaver held off a late Citadel rally to get his fourth win (as well as his fourth
complete game) of the year.

“We started to hit like we can,” said Simonds. “They helped by fielding like we had been.”

The series left Davidson in third place in the division. Since only two teams from each division make the playoffs,
Davidson needs to win at least five of their remaining six conference games to stand a chance of being in
the playoffs. Since all six are road games, that may be more than can be asked. The Cats need some
great pitching down the stretch if post-season play is to become a reality.
