FRIDAY, JANUARY 17, 1958 6 THE DAVIDSONIAN BY GEORGE RAMSEY SCOTT FORESEES IMPROVEMENTS “With the Southern Conference meet to be held here in May, there are several improvements we'll have to make on the track.” And coach Scott went on to enumerate various improvements needed in the local athletic facilities. Conference meet requirements specify that the shot and discus must be hurled from a circle with a concrete base, which base must be added to the throwing area here at Davidson. The runways for the broad jump and pole vault should be black-topped, said Scott, and cinders must be added to the track itself to improve its surface.

INTRAMURAL FIELDS
Outside of the track improvements, Scott cited needs in other areas which should be met as soon as possible. He considered the greatest need to be the betterment of the intramural fields, especially those on the old golf course, which need to be leveled to provide adequate facilities for intramural softball and flickerball. Possible work on the football field would include grading of the field, and erecting a fence around the field. As to the matter of lighting the tennis courts, Scott replied that the primary reason that this has not been done is that there are no electric lines in that vicinity. He indicated that he was strongly in favor of lighting the courts, possibly by a meter system, whereby the students would help pay for the electricity as they played.

SPRING GRID GRIND
Elsewhere around the coaching staff, coach Dole sent out a call for all boys interested in football to report to spring practice on Friday, January 31, the first day after exams. Dole stated that anyone in the student body is welcome to come out. Equipment should be checked out during exams from Doc White in the equipment room of the gym. Practice will continue for five weeks, with sessions being held on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. Likewise, any boy interested in managing the grid squad is urged to contact either coach Dole or manager Sandy Grey.

SCHOLARLY GRIDDERS
Due recognition are three members of the 1957 football team who earned positions on the conference all-scholastic team selected by the staff of American Peoples’ Encyclopedia. Tackle Paul Biggers and fullback Dave Warden received a set of the encyclopedia, and end Harold Westervelt, named to the team for the second year in succession, earned a case for the encyclopedia set which he received in 1956.

Coach Charlie Parker, anxious to get the picture of his boy Westy hung in the gym, is joining with coaches Scott and Whittle in an effort to hang the framed photos of recent Davidson athletic standouts in the trophy room along with pictures of other Wildcat greats. Look for the pictures of recent honorees to be hung soon. The Charlotte Clippers’ Davidson College night, mentioned in this column earlier, is slated for Thursday night, January 30, when the Clips, current pace-setters in the Eastern Hockey League, skate out against the Clinton Comets. Should be a nice icing for the cake — cooked up by the faculty.

Matmen Top State, Host VMI Tomorrow
By BOB GREEN
The Davidson matmen scored a strong 21-13 victory over North Carolina State at Raleigh last Saturday. VMI, Southern Conference champion wrestlers, will test coach Parker’s men here tomorrow afternoon. Davidson’s Bob Schacter took the 123 pound division by a forfeit, while Waller Taylor, 137 pound class, decisioned Troutman of State 7-4. In the 140 pound competition freshman Bob McIntyre outpointed Fields 5-3 for another Cat victory. Milton Gee took the 147 pound class on a default, his opponent being injured during the match. Falls claimed Davidson's Charlie Lampley who was pinned by Malteese in the 150 pound division and Captain Dave Fagg who was pinned by State’s Nelson in the heavyweight bout. Richie King lost a 1-0 decision to Broyhill to complete the scoring column. Coach Parker praised Westervelt’s fine showing against State and his consistent competitive spirit. He stated that Westy really hasn't been pushed this year, but that VMI's Baker would be a very tough opponent if he wrestles in the 167 pound class. Freshmen McIntyre and Taylor, who wrestled his first match of the year against State were also cited for outstanding performances. The lineup for tomorrow's clash with VMI will probably find Lampley in the 137 pound division and Harrison May in the 140 pound slot. The Keydets dropped the Cats 22-10 last season so the hosts will really have to fight to win this one.

Last year for the 2nd time, the local chapter of Sigma Delta Psi National Athletic Fraternity, entered the national championship contest that is held yearly. Previously, D. C., had won it in 1938. Davidson made a very respectable showing both collectively and individually, with each man entering the ten events he had been most skilled at — those events being the ones required for admittance into the fraternity. Springfield College won the championship scoring and the championship for new members, while Davidson placed second.

HOLD 6-6 RECORD
By JIM HAMILTON
Davidsonian Sports Writer
The Davidson courtmen, resting in an unfamiliar second place tie in Southern Conference standings before last night's clash with Furman, will attempt to strengthen or regain their grasp on the number two rung of the conference ladder tomorrow night as they battle The Citadel in Johnston gym. The Citadel presents quite a problem for the ‘Cats, having been tied with Davidson for second place in conference standings before yesterday's action. The sophomore-studded Bulldogs own a 4-2 record, and have twice vanquished William and Mary, the only conference team to defeat Davidson this year. With two starters from Ohio, two from Indiana, and one from South Carolina, the Bulldogs are a manifestation of Mark Clark’s athletic build-up program. Ohioan Dick Wherry at guard and forward Art Musselman, swing man, from Indiana, provide the punch in The Citadel attack.

SAD FINALE
Davidson experienced a disappointing finale to an otherwise successful northern sojourn Monday night as they fell to William and Mary, 75-61 at Williamsburg, in what coach Scott called “not one of our better games.” The score was tied 54-54, with six minutes to play, and at the three minute mark, the Indians held a 61-57 edge. However, they had the ball. Davidson's pressing defense backfired as William and Mary scored one field goal and twelve foul shots to the Wildcats’ four points, to produce the final 75-61 margin. Freshman Bill Shinn led the local hardwooders with a 16 point effort, while Roy Lange led the victors with 22. Previous to Monday night's game, Davidson had dumped M.I. 56-52, and Washington and Lee 84-63 on the Virginia road ahead. Davidson's over-all record now stands at the .500 mark, with 6 wins and 6 losses. Coach Scott feels, however, that it is significant that five of the wins—Wofford, VMI, W. & L., and two over Catawba, were against teams that beat Davidson last year. With 12 games remaining, the Wildcats face a tough opposition.

Typically A Captain,” Fagg Earns Accolades!
Those who know Dave know what that sign means to him and his way of life. Dave's leadership in which football coach Bill Dole and wrestling coach Charlie Parker have so much confidence, is a product of his own personal philosophy.Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

---

how it leaves its mark on ling coach Charlie him. Dave excels. Dave has included himself as one of “those” and has earned high school and college honors by having been “self-made,” working hard for what he gets. From the same motives rise Parker states that Dave has actually made the job of coaching this year’s mat-men easier than ever as their captain. Dole, under whom Fagg served as captain this past football season, added that Dave, along with Bill Price, was greatly responsible for the team’s success and adds that Dave's character is of the highest quality. Being captain is from high school conference and worthy of honorable mention in the state. He captured the state 177 lb. wrestling championship his senior year and had taken third in the 165 class the year before. He will attend North Carolina University next year with a high B average and on a fellowship. Tribute is paid to a great Davidsonian.

INTERFRATERNITY SWIMMING finals were held Wednesday night, with the defending champion Phi Delts again capturing the title. Runners-up SAE waged a down-to-the-wire fight with the champs for the crown, and finished 1½ points back. (Photo by Stevens.)

The Davidson Swimming team stroked out its second win of the season here Wednesday afternoon with a 54 to 28 victory over Wake Forest. Captain Fritz Russell started the afternoon off right by gaining a lead in the first lap of the medley relay which the remainder of the team, Joe Beil, Jim Alexander, and Bob Wynne, lengthened. From then on it was almost all Cats as they collected six firsts, as many seconds, and five thirds for the victory. The locals placed well in all freestyle events with Tom Hudgins and Bill Hellier, respectively, gaining first and third in the 220. Hudgins scored another first in the 440-yard event and George Gable came out ahead in the 50-yard dash with senior Bob Jones right behind him. Johnny Scott won firsts in both the 200 butterfly and breaststroke to add to the Davidson point total; fast-improving divers Jack Rose and Jim Black placed second and third, respectively, in their event; and Herold Westervelt winning first place in the 200-yard freestyle relay, when the winning Sigma Chi team was disqualified. Finishing second in this event were the K.A.’s.
