‘Hobart’s Park’ editors announce department heads

Lyman Collins, Amanda Hall, and Greg Hankins are attempting to establish a new platform for the exchange of new ideas. Collins, Hall, and Hankins are the editors of the new publication which they say has been created to fill a gap in the media structure of Davidson College caused by the demise of Inklings (a freshman literary magazine) and Scripts 'n Pranks.

They say that the magazine is not intended to compete with the Miscellany and point to the fact that they intend to cover a much broader scope on a more informal basis.

According to Collins, “We don’t think we'll be getting rejects from the Miscellany.”

NEW MEDIA Board members (left to right) John Willingham, Ann Garner, and Harry Grey- ard talked about the need for better guidelines.

New appointees voice concerns

(Continued from page 1) pointed to the need for specific guidelines for the media. According to Article XI, Section 6, paragraph B of the College Constitution the Board “promulgates and periodically reviews the standards of responsible journalism by which the media abide; and assures media adherence to them.”

“I would like to see us draw up specifics on good taste, etc. in the Davidson media,” stated Willingham.

Garner asserted, “We need guidelines from the start, rather than afterwards. It would greatly simplify our duties if we had particular, agreed points to refer to.”

He also stated that student response has been good and that 35 to 40 people have shown up for their organizational meetings.

At the last meeting the name, Hobart’s Park, was chosen and department heads were announced. These are: Sue Behoney, Poetry and Fiction; Ann Tutwiler, Politics; Aida Doss, Assigned Reviews and Previews; Andy Miller, Essays; Whit Yelverton, Photography; Cathie Chester, Graphics.

The deadline for submissions to the first issue is October 27, and they should be given to one from Davidson College and it is hoped that students and faculty alike will submit their works. Collins wishes to make it clear that the magazine is open to an extremely broad range of material and asks that anybody who has anything that he would like to see published get in touch with him or one of the staff members.

The magazine does not have a post office box number at the present time. Publication details have not been resolved. The subscription price, number of pages, initial publication date, and type of paper are all tentative. Collins explains, “The magazine will be printed on the highest quality paper that the magazine can afford and we're currently talking with printers in and around Charlotte.”

“The subscription price should be about $6.00 and we expect the first issue to come out in early November.” Hankins backs that up saying, “We're going to make it into print.” The editors are hoping to be able to print two issues a term and have received a $1500 allowance for the purpose.

Students will not have to pay for their subscriptions and the editors are hoping to launch an extensive off-campus subscription drive.

Hall expressed a need for people to help with the subscription drive and the graphics and layout of the magazine, and Collins has made a plea for help in the advertising department saying that people are needed to help contact businesses or individuals who might be interested in advertising in the magazine.

So far, the editors and the staff have shown a lot of enthusiasm for the project and are very optimistic about its chances for success.
