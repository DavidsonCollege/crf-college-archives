**Staff Editorial**

You probably noticed that this week’s front page is pure fiction. It’s our annual end-of-the-year spoof edition, designed to provide
a little humor and entertainment for you as the hellacious exam period draws near. Given the hectic schedules and high
stress levels that we are under these days, it’s unlikely that many of you will have the time or sense
of humor to fully enjoy The Davidsonian’s attempt at comedy.

More importantly, we may neglect to take a moment to step back and recall the year that was. That would
be quite a mistake, because even a quick recollection of the 2001-2002 school year demonstrates what a momentous term it
has been. From the almost-weekly Patterson Court scandals to the Royal Shakespeare Company’s visit to the men’s basketball NCAA Tournament
trip, this has been a year to remember.

To the seniors, we say congratulations on making it to the finish line, and good luck in the future. We’ll
avoid the annual graduation clichés that are used at many graduation ceremonies this time of year, except to offer you
our admiration and best wishes in everything you do. To those who haven’t found jobs just yet, and you know
who you are, we say keep your heads up and stay strong. And if you don’t eventually get hired somewhere,
we might have an opening for a circulation manager in the Fall (Hey, $35 a week isn’t so bad, right?).

To the administrators and faculty, we say thanks for making our lives miserable with all this work, because we know
it will eventually pay big dividends. To the friendly staff members in Vail Commons, the Union, the Library, Chambers Building
and elsewhere, we say thanks for getting us through another semester. To the RLO folks, we say enjoy the time
off. Your office was showered with criticism practically every week, and regardless of whether it was deserved, y’all certainly deserve
a vacation.

To President Bobby Vagt, we appreciate the time and honesty that you give to us each week so that we
can accurately convey the voice of the administration. To those who shared their opinions through thoughtful editorials and letters to
the editor, we express our profound gratitude. Our goal was to use these pages to inform, entertain and provoke readers,
ultimately encouraging them to think about the issues facing our campus and our world. Thanks to the efforts of our
writers, we believe we succeeded.

To all our readers both here on campus and beyond, we say thanks for making our labors worthwhile. Hope you
enjoyed reading our paper. We look forward to the summer, and the promise of a new school year that might
be just as memorable.

WELL... IT LOOKED LIKE GOOD WORK ON PAPER

**Thank you, Dr. Biles**

Davidson College and the students of my introductory Greek class in particular are about to bid goodbye to a professor
whose character inside and outside of the classroom can only be described as singular. Dr. Zachary Biles has been an
integral part of our lives since August, and we will miss him.

Dr. Biles was more than willing to accept the Davidson tradition of camaraderie with students. As a newcomer to Davidson,
Dr. Biles was not consumed by an effort to find a place for himself among faculty. Instead, he emphasized his
responsibility to the students. He made ancient Greek both enjoyable and understandable, and many in our class undoubtedly would not
have stuck with it had he not been the professor. For us, he is not only a devoted educator but
also a friend.

If it were up to the students, Dr. Biles would remain here at Davidson so that others might have the
privilege of studying under him. Yet the students are not involved in such decisions, so we must begrudgingly bid him
farewell as we realize Davidson’s loss. Next year he...is off to the University of Virginia, and the Cavaliers are truly
lucky to have him coming. So thank you, Dr. Biles, and good luck from all of us. It has been
a pleasure.

On the Senior Banquet

Although Davidson College claims to be a school dedicated to promoting diversity in all aspects of campus life, Monday’s senior
banquet did not reflect this goal. Many seniors (and not just minorities) felt that the banquet was geared towards certain
groups of students. Neither the 30 to 45 superlatives given nor the slide show seemed to accurately reflect the diversity
of the graduating class. Following are a few observations made about the banquet:

1. Davidson College provides the Second Family program that pairs minority students with faculty/staff members to provide a home away
from home in the Davidson community. The Second Family dinner was planned weeks in advance for April 29th. The senior
banquet was originally scheduled for April 30th; however, the date was changed to the same night as the Second Family
dinner. Upon receiving this notice, the senior African American females immediately responded to the email about the conflict of date.
The senior banquet committee chairs received numerous emails, which they politely disregarded.

2. The effort that was made to collect pictures from the senior African American community seemed insincere. An email was
sent to the senior African American females on April 25th asking for fun pictures because we were underrepresented. However, the
pictures were not collected until 4 p.m. the day of the banquet. Regardless of the African Americans’ attempt to communicate
earlier in the week, many of the pictures were not collected at all. Our pictures seemed to be a last-minute,
“politically correct” addition.

3. The senior banquet committee did not seem to consist of a diverse group of people. The committee included mixed
gender but excluded various ethnicities. Regardless of how the committee was chosen, there needed to be a more aggressive effort
to include a better representation of the senior class. Overall, it seemed very “cliquish.” The senior committee did an adequate
job of organizing the event, but the banquet did not cater to the entire senior class; it seemed as if
it only targeted a small group of individuals.

Underclassmen, be advised that every class is comprised of many different types of people and the goal of the senior
banquet is to reflect everyone’s Davidson experiences, not just a select few. Better efforts need to be made in order
to increase solidarity amongst Davidson students.

Good luck,

Parties never stopped

In response to “Where have all the parties gone?” (Letter to the Editor, April 17). Unfortunately, Ryan Pagan was so
busy writing off eating houses based on stereotypes that he was oblivious to the parties going on. While he was
writing his letter perpetuating the stereotype that “CoHo is more concerned with saving the whales or ridding the world of
Styrofoam [than having parties],” there was a party going on at CoHo that Friday, the sort of party he says
he misses from years past. I’m sorry that you didn’t come, Ryan, because I think if you had put aside
your incorrect stereotypes of the various eating houses and actually attended our party, you might have been pleasantly surprised.

Beer, which you list as one of the four most important things in planning a party, was certainly available, although
I have to admit that we did not “stock up on the Beast” as you recommended. Instead, we had a
variety of brands to choose from. There were the obligatory and “guy-friendly” nacho chips to go with that beer, as
well as vegetarian sushi, cookies, and a wide variety of sodas. The music was eclectic, and had you come to
our party and requested some music “with which guys can identify,” I think our DJ would have been more than
happy to play your requests.

But as your letter stated, “the year’s not over.” On Saturday from 8 to 11 p.m., CoHo is having Jam
Session III with music “that people actually listen to” performed by members of Deloris Revenge and other Davidson bands and
solo artists. Come down to CoHo (or any other eating house) and get to know what we are really like.
But for our sake, just remember to recycle that Solo cup when you’re finished.
