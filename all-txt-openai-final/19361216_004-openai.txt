CLASH IN CLASSIC RATS AND TEA-HOUNDS

SPORTS AFIELD

CAGERS OPEN SEASON HERE TONIGHT

Game Tonight

Getting back to the factor in Davidson's hard drive now for a Southern Conference crown. Just Dittles. Bad weather and a small crowd helped the pro game in Charlotte to be a sad flop... Dick Jol and Jim Johnston are competing for the post of athletic director at Sweet Briar. The soccer team deserves a hand for its showing. Any resemblance to the meeting of the student body of the South Conference was certainly coincidental. First, Virginia passed new measures to eliminate the red tape in the Graham plan. She turned around and... Jowl classics seem to be in vogue these days, so the great “dormitory tilt” has been dubbed the Water Bowl (dating back to that ancient date when it was customary to christen the rival dormitory with a very adequate fire hose). Whatever became of those All Opponent elevens picked by the Davidson team? ... We hope there is no truth to the rumors that our coaches may be lured elsewhere next year. Tip: Guy Lombardo will not play for Mid-Winters!

CHARLOTTE OBSERVER FETES GRIDIRON ACES

Jake Wade Presides Over Sports Banquet

The first All-Carolina Football Banquet, featuring several celebrities of the sports world, was held last night at seven o'clock in the Hotel Charlotte. Jake Wade, sports editor of the Charlotte Observer, presided and introduced the speakers. Guests of honor were: the South Carolina All-State team, the Tar Heel All-State team, and the head coaches from colleges in both Carolinas. Davidson was well represented at the fete, having two senior linemen (Joe Hunter and Dick Johnson), one back (Teeny Lafferty), and the three varsity coaches (Newton, McEver, and Chapman).

Dukes Lick Team in Heart-Breaker Thursday

The basketball squad is pictured here. From left to right: Al Cumbie, Wade Barrow, Bill Hancock, Dick Cathey, Lawrence Reid, Bill Quick, John Armstrong, Bill Kiesewetter, Ned Iverson, and J. D. Hicks. Every one of these veterans has returned this year, although Cumbie has not yet reported for practice. The team will be reinforced by the graduates of the strong Kitten team that enjoyed such a successful 1936 season. These new players are making strong bids for berths on the first team and are giving good accounts of themselves. They may replace some of the more experienced men before the year is over. With all this splendid talent, Coach Laird is in almost the same predicament as the “old woman who lived in a shoe,” and has solved his problems by deciding to establish a B team which will present an array nearly as strong as that of the varsity. The team is practicing daily now and there is a mad scramble for positions. The 1936 edition of the Wildcats will pry the Davidson gym.

Watts and Georgia Meet In Renewal of Grid Feud

Enthusiasm Runs Riot as Teams Tangle in Water Bowl Classic

SUGG, LUTZ LEAD CHEERS

Kornegay and Allen Sponsor Publicity Drive

By Perry Sloan

Despite the dampers of the administrative and natural elements that the battle could not be covered in the actual Davidsonian, watch for the next issue. Don't tell anyone that there were pre-war machines on our campus, but enthusiasm was running high between the said dormitories. Some of the student store quarterbacks of both flats have ventured their sage predictions on the outcome, notably Colonel Stoop Kornegay and Squire John D. Allen. These alumni secretaries of both tenements, better known as publicity men today, have solicited the moral support of old grads who were unable to attend.

Lutz Confident

An interview on the eve of battle with head cheerleader H. Lutz of the Tea Hounds emphasizes the confidence and assurance in the Watts stronghold. H. and cohorts plan to spice up the game with acrobatics next year. He says, “It’s going to be a great game! We'll take Georgia like Grant took Richmond. Sorry we couldn't christen it All-State teams. This is the first one held to honor both North and South Carolina players and will be an annual affair from now on.

Frosh Cagers**Show Promise First Game Is Scheduled With ’Cat B Team**

The basketball squad has now completed two weeks of hard practice under the direction of Coach Chet Chapman. During this period of time, a great deal of improvement has been shown among the players. The team opens its current season with the Davidson B team next Saturday. The Frosh were scheduled to play the Catawba B's on Wednesday, but because of a mix-up in schedules, the game was canceled.

Harrison and Glenn are working nicely at the forward positions, the latter showing much better form than at the first of the season. Rackley is holding down the center position, showing particular adeptness at taking balls off the backboard. Tenny and Thomas are teaming nicely at the guard positions, and both show exceptional ball-handling ability.

**Reserve Basketballers Play Regular Schedule**

A new feature was added to the Davidson basketball program this year when the authorities decided to organize a “B” team. Athletic Director Norman Shepard announced that due to the large amount of good material on hand for this year’s edition of the Davidson varsity, the squad would have to be cut, and therefore necessitate the forming of a “B” squad. A schedule of about ten games has been arranged, opening with the Davidson freshmen next Saturday, and including strong teams throughout the state. Practically all of the boys that make up this squad have either one or two more years of service, and the advantage of playing in actual competition will aid them greatly when they report to practice in future seasons.

**DAVIDSON GRAPPLERS TIE SPRAY Y.M.C.A. IN HOTLY FOUGHT BOUT**

To Meet Winston-Salem Team Saturday Night

On Saturday night, the Davidson wrestling team tied the Spray Y.M.C.A. wrestling team in a hotly contested match. The final score was 14 to 14. There were eight individual matches. The individual scores are as follows: 118 lb., Hill, Spray, over Blue, Davidson, time advantage, 3:45 min.; 126 lb., Lowrance, Dav., over Pulliam, Spray, time advantage 3:15 min.; 135 lb., Whitt, Spray, over Alexander, Dav., fall, 8:00 min.; 145 lb., Parker, Dav., over Fugerson, Spray, fall, 4:45 min.; 155 lb., Peltendreight, captain of Spray’s team, over Fort, Dav., time advantage, 1:00 min. in an extra period; 165 lb., Ellis, Dav., over Vestal, Spray, time advantage, 1:40 min.; 175 lb., Brown, Dav., over Underwood, Spray, time advantage, 1:55 min.; unlimited, Shields, Spray, over McFadyen, Dav., time advantage, 7:00 min.

Coach Parks Harrison stated that no injuries were sustained and according to him, the team is in fine shape. During this week, the team will have some stiff practice making ready for the match that they are to have with the Winston-Salem Y.M.C.A. on Saturday night of this week.

**All-Star Volleyball Teams Are Selected**

Mokey Faison, known widely as an expert referee of intramural sports and famous prognosticator, has come through with his All-Star class and fraternity volleyball teams. His All-Class selection goes as follows: Kellog, Junior; Tice, Soph; Boyd, Soph; Anders, Senior; Sloan, Soph; Sample, Soph; Hancock (c), Senior; Peters, Senior; Ramsey, Frosh. The Greeks who made the All-Fraternity team are: Reid (c), Phi Gam; Kiesewetter, Phi Gam; Durham, Pika; Dickson, Pika; Lyons, SPE; Branton, Phi Gam; Lee, Phi Delt; Barrow, Kappa Sig; Casali, SPE. Honorable mention goes to Sellars, Moffett, Bones, Harmon, Woodward, Carlson, Graham, Iverson, and Baker. You fellows who were not mentioned, don’t give up all hope and resolve to end it all, but come out and work harder next year for that most coveted of all honors—being chosen on one of Colonel Faison’s All-Star teams.

**WILDCATS MEET CATAWBA QUINT IN GYM TONIGHT**

Alumni gymnasium will resound to the cheers of Davidson fans tonight when the quintet takes the floor against a fast, experienced team from Catawba College. The Wildcats and Catawba split last year with one game apiece; both teams want this game which will break the tie. Under the able tutelage of Coach Blake Laird, the rough edges which have been brought out in practice are rapidly being smoothed over, and by the first conference game, the ‘Cats should be ready to give any team in the league a bang-up game. The excellence of the material has made the competition so keen that no player has a berth on the first team cinched. Numerous combinations have been tried to find the five men who co-ordinate the best on both offense and defense. Several have looked good in practice but that of Captain Bill Quick and Maurice Peabody, guards, J.D. Hicks at center, and Ned Iverson and John Armstrong forwards, has clicked together a little better than any other. It will take plenty of expert playing by these men, however, to keep such stellar players as Bill Hancock, Ken Knorr, Bill Kiesewetter, and Wade Barrow from taking their places.
