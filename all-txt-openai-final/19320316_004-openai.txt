### Alumni Death

**Ernest H. Graham, '13**

Ernest Heap Graham, a 1913 graduate of Davidson, died suddenly of a heart attack in Goldsboro on Monday, March 10th. Mr. Graham was talking to a friend in the Algonquin Club rooms in Goldsboro when, without any warning or indication that he was unwell, his head dropped forward. Physicians were summoned hurriedly from offices in the building, but they pronounced him dead of heart disease when they arrived. He had not previously suffered a heart attack, and there was no indication that he was afflicted with this disease.

After completing his four years at Davidson in 1913, Mr. Graham entered the cotton mill business at Greenville, S.C., and continued there until 1919, when he went to Goldsboro in an executive capacity with the Utility Manufacturing Company, plywood plant operators. Though the concern changed hands, Mr. Graham remained with them until a year ago when he resigned to enter the plywood brokerage business for himself. While on a trip through this section last fall, Mr. Graham visited Davidson for a half-hour, spending most of his time on the football field, a phase of college life in which he was intensely interested. Among the survivors is a brother, Fred W. Graham, ’09, of Greenville, S.C.

**“Tiny” Is Dead**

“Tiny” Graham is dead. To those of the present generation that means little, but to those who played for and against Davidson College athletic teams between 1909-1913, it means many heartaches, for they know that one of the gamest athletes who ever played the game has gone. He came to Davidson in 1909, a mere wisp of a lad but 18 years of age. His nickname was applied immediately, for the young chap weighed about 130 pounds. And it was this tiny boy who made football and baseball history for Davidson, and who is today considered by many as the greatest quarterback who ever played for this institution. There are others who contend that he was the greatest all-around athlete who has been at Davidson, but this might be disputed by others who point to men who made three letters here. But even the mere thought of this is a tribute to the man, for those three-letter men and star performers of later days have weighed much over the bare 130 pounds at which Graham tipped the scales.

Graham had the distinct and unusual honor of captaining both the varsity football and baseball teams at Davidson his Senior year; was vice-president and later president of both the “D” Club and the Athletic Association, in addition to other honors. He broke his leg his Junior year, but this did not deter him from participation the following fall, when he “imbued the fellows with his spirit of fight and determination,” as the college yearbook for 1913 expressed it.

Last fall a year ago, Mr. Graham paid his last official visit to Davidson, and he returned with other members of the famous 1910 football eleven of Davidson to celebrate the 20th anniversary of that team. It was the 1910 aggregation that won the first state championship for Davidson, and it was “Tiny” Graham who called the signals and piloted them to victories. When he was asked on his return what stimulated and keyed his fighting spirit more than anything else, he answered simply, “Being outclassed.”

Staunch friends at Davidson mourn his death, but there are hundreds of other friends in the business and professional world today who remember his name and his exploits, whether they played with him or against him, or whether they read about him in the headlines of sport pages.

**Other Alumni News**

The Peoples National Bank at Rock Hill, S.C., has been made president and treasurer of the Arcade Cotton Mills, of Rock Hill, succeeding the president who died a short time ago.

**Enthusiastic Meeting Attended by 77 at New Bern on March 7—Rev. R. E. McClure, President**

(Editor’s Note: The following account is only part of the column and a half report of the Davidson meeting in New Bern, which appeared in The Sun-Journal March 8th.)

So successful was the Davidson alumni banquet Monday night at the First Presbyterian lecture room, with former college students present from 14 towns of the section, that a permanent Eastern Carolina chapter of Davidson alumni was organized, with Rev. R. F. McClure, ’20, pastor of the local church, as president; Dr. R. S. McGeachy, '94, of Kinston, vice-president, and Gene Booth, '23, of Kinston, secretary-treasurer. These officers were named as an executive committee, to draft definite details of organization and plan for annual meetings in different towns of Eastern Carolina. Approximately 100 alumni reside in the region, it was pointed out.

Dr. Walter L. Lingle, president of Davidson College, who had addressed an afternoon public gathering on “Bible in the Schools,” was the chief banquet speaker and honor guest. He gave an interesting resume of work being accomplished at Davidson College, now with 647 students, and reported that the institution will probably finish the year with a small balance. Though the individual students were said to be hard pressed financially, they were said to be studying more.

Replete with wit and humor and interspersed with many appropriate anecdotes, Dr. Lingle told of efforts at the college for building up a first-class department of physical education in which all forms of athletics would be integrated. He said that the public seemed more interested in the election of a new football coach than in the naming of a new president. In concluding his remarks, he urged in sending to the college the highest types of upstanding young men.

With Prof. R. C. Deal, '01, of East Carolina Teachers College, of Greenville, acting as toastmaster, there was much more wit on the program as handled in his own characteristic and inimitable style displayed in New Bern on other occasions. A high tribute was paid by him to Dr. J. N. H. Summerell, of Greenville, pastor emeritus of the local church, oldest alumnus present, a member of the class of 1873.

While no official report from the New Bern officers has been obtained, it is understood here that 77 people attended the dinner there. Making up this number were alumni of Davidson, parents of the boys now enrolled, trustees of the institution in that section, ministers of Albemarle Presbytery, and prospective students. Many of the latter were sons of Davidson alumni.

**Bluefield, W. Va., Alumni May Meet Next Monday**

When The Davidsonian went to press Monday night, the alumni secretary had not heard from West Virginia authorities about a proposed alumni meeting in Bluefield, W. Va., next Monday night. Dr. Walter L. Lingle, president of Davidson, is to preach in the Presbyterian Church at Welch, W. Va., next Sunday, and consented to remain over an extra day for an alumni meeting in Bluefield.

Rev. S. W. Moore, D.D., '93, of Bluefield, and Rev. Smiley Williams, ’14, of Welch, were written late last week, with a suggestion that a dinner meeting be held at which would be present alumni of Davidson, parents of the boys enrolled, the Presbyterian ministers of that section, and prospective students. A list of alumni was dispatched with the letter.

In the fall golf tournament, McGill was first; Wolfe,Second; Love, third; Martin, fourth, and Mills, fifth. The prospects look very good for a successful season on the links. Don Wharton and Harllee Branch, Jr., were selected to represent Davidson on the northern debating trip. They will debate William and Mary, Gettysburg, and Rutgers. The last issue of the Chameleon will be out sometime in May, according to Mac Austin, the editor-in-chief. The Davidson rifle team will be represented in the national intercollegiate competition by S. W. Vance, Ramsey, Webb, Gudger, and Lennon. The New York Alumni chapter of Davidson held an enthusiastic meeting in that city last Friday night. W. P. Anderson, ’07, was re-elected president; H. A. Johnson, '03, was chosen as vice-president, and Hadley A. Hill, ‘21, was re-elected secretary-treasurer. 

Charlie Paddock, the world’s fastest human, will visit Davidson next fall. He will appear under the auspices of the Y. M. C. A., and will give a talk to the students on the meaning of sports.

March 15, 1922

The Gamma chapter of Phi Beta Kappa was formally installed in Davidson College by the initiation of the following men: R. E. Davidson, Rock Hill, S. C.; W. A. Gamble, Macon, Ga.; W. G. Guille, Athens, Tenn.; D. H. Ogden, Mobile, Ala.; and H. H. Smith, Easley, South Carolina. Coaches Buck Currie and Dutch Hepgeveld are working hard with the candidates for baseball. Captain Pat Crawford, who has just finished a successful basketball season, is fast getting into form for the coming season. Horseshoe pitching is a sure sign of spring and we've noticed that the professionals are fast turning out for practice. “Spec” McConnell, Arbuthnot, Bradley, McComb, Mac Beall, and Black are practicing hard. Coach Aiken declares that prospects are good. Hugh Smith, representing O. D. K., and accompanied by Albert Hillhouse, were present at the annual O. D. K. convention held at the University of Richmond, in Richmond, February 16th and 17th. 

A radius of approximately 75 miles of Bluefield, and there are now 15 students in Davidson from Bluefield and near vicinity. The names of 14 prospective students, obtained from present members of the student body, were passed along to the two ministers. It is believed that if the local men consider it feasible and advisable that a group of approximately 40 people would gather to hear Dr. Lingle.

Dr. John W. MacConnell, Davidson physician, left here Monday night for New York City, where he will meet tonight with the Davidson alumni there. He will also attend alumni dinner meetings in Philadelphia and Baltimore before returning to Davidson. Dr. MacConnell is making this eastern trip at the special invitation of the New York chapter, the other meetings being arranged on his return trip to Davidson. The itinerary of the Davidson physician is New York, March 16th, at the Hotel LaSalle, 30 E. 60th St., 7 p.m.; Philadelphia, March 17th, Hotel Rittenhouse, 22nd and Chestnut Sts., 6:30 p.m.; and Baltimore, March 18th, Warwick Arms, 16 E.

Harris, '17, heads the alumni group in Philadelphia, and Dr. H. C. Davis, '02, is president of the Baltimore alumni. Approximately 200 Davidson alumni are located in these three eastern cities. The largest number is in New York, with 129 former students of Davidson residing in or near the metropolis. There are 37 in Philadelphia and 30 in Baltimore. The annual dinner meetings in these three cities are exceptionally well attended, for approximately 75 percent of the alumni are present at the gatherings.

Walter I. Knox, '22, has been given another excellent promotion, and is now chief clerk to the assistant passenger agent of the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Company. His headquarters will hereafter be in Cincinnati, but he is residing at 3914 Elsmere Ave., Norwood, Ohio. Dr. E. W. Phifer, '01, of Morganton, has retired as president of the Catawba Valley Medical Society, and at the last meeting over which he presided last week he discussed a paper entitled, “Little Things.”

Alumni Personals

The number of alumni visitors to the campus has been materially cut down since the close of the winter football practices. The only alumnus seen here last week was J. Linwood Hall, '31, of Burlington. Friends will regret to learn of the death of Mrs. J. R. Simpson, mother of Dr. W. D. Simpson, ‘98, of Greenville, S. C., and of W. H. Belk, trustee of Davidson, of Charlotte. Rev. James T. Pharr, ‘12, pastor of the Cass (W. Va.) Presbyterian Church, assisted by Rev. M. R. Atkinson, recently conducted a two-week evangelistic service during which there were 52 conversions, 125 reconsecrations, and 1,325 chapters in the Bible read. Mayor Geo. W. Coan, Jr., "11, of Winston-Salem, whom it was announced a short time ago was head of the anti-hoarding committee of his city, has appointed J. Harold McKeithan, '22, as one of his committeemen. James H. Henderlite, Jr., ’31, of Gastonia, has recently accepted a position in the chemical department of the Burlington Dyeing and Process Company. Robert A. Gilliam, also of Gastonia, has been with the Burlington concern for some time. 

Johnston, ’80, for 22 years president of MEAG J. Edwin Stroud, ’31, of Goldsboro, was another Davidson alumnus who successfully passed the physical examination at Langley Field for the Army Air Corps. It was announced two weeks ago that B. R. Lowrance, '31, had passed the examination, which gives Davidson College a very high percentage of the number who were accepted. Mr. Lowrance has already been ordered to report, and Mr. Stroud expects to receive his orders for the July class. Prof. John W. Moore, '12, principal of the R. J. Reynolds High School of Winston-Salem, will attend the three-day session of the 48th annual convention of the North Carolina Educational Association in Charlotte, Thursday-Saturday, and will direct a discussion on special promotions. Kenneth M. Jackson, ‘31, is now doing graduate study in history at Vanderbilt University. The Winston-Salem Community Chest drive for $140,000, which was headed by S. Clay Williams, '05, as chairman, was oversubscribed in three and a half days. In reply to a congratulatory letter written him by the alumni secretary, Mr. Williams wrote: “One of our distinguished alumni said some years ago that there should be only two classes of people in Winston-Salem—those who help the community chest and those who are helped by it. Of course, that statement represented an ideal, but we came nearer attaining that goal this year than ever before.” W. W. Morris, "92, of Concord, recently attended a meeting of the Southern Cotton Growers Co-operative Association when it met in New Orleans. Mr. Morris is a director of the association. A letter from J. W. Brown, ’12, Y. M. C. A. worker in Rumania, corroborated a recent report in Time that he was threatened with recall because of the financial condition of the American Y. M. C. A. Mr. Brown wrote that “it will be a tremendous disappointment if we have to abandon the incompleted projects and give up a worthy cause to which we have devoted years of effort and in which thousands of dollars have been invested.” He stated that the problem to be solved was to secure his own budget, which had been previously provided by the American Association, but gave no intimation that this could be done. R. P. Richardson, ‘18, is one of the three incorporators of The Memorial Hospital, of Reidsville. Stockholders in the Carson Realty Company, of Charlotte, recently incorporated, are James H. Carson, '16, and McAlister Carson, '13.
