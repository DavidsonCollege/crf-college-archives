Chanel No. 5 to Infinity

I follow another concrete walk and catch the odour of a sweet stagnant body which earlier crossed my path.

The scent hangs on a shelf in the air and attracts the vague memory of old girlfriends who also carry
that smell.

I begin to see men on horseback trotting everywhere, faceless yet all with the same name and sized, stylish colors
playing the game today as others have before, mounted and stabled on clothing racks fading out as time creeps by.

In his deepest dream, he saw the woman-child all around, searching for simple seduction in her Sargasso Sea. He offered
an outstretched masculine hand filled with bottles and symbols and dropping acid smells and tastes. She approached with the temerity
of the ginger-fawn, with cautious hoof and trusting eyes, eyes that trusted the unknown and knew nothing of what could
not be trusted. The image fades as I walk on and recall countless times when I was caught by that
smell, standing still at those parties.

A Night Shot

The cock cried in the middle of the night, a mistaken identity; someone thought it was a night-raven. The garbage
had collected in the bin in the backyard next to which some stray bitches slept with cats. The drunk tottered
down the alley mouthing incoherence, suddenly swooned next to the pillar-box post to which someone somewhere far from here had
posted. The chemist was involved, maybe the traducers or the ‘other’ man. Everyone was tranquilized to slumber with a programmed
suddenness, even the birds died during their sleep. The sun arose next morning, maybe that very night; its rays struggling
to clear the debris of the night, and the dreary dread of the deadened nerves.
