**Men’s track finishes ninth in Southern Conference meet**

By ANDY ARMSTRONG
Staff Writer

The men’s track team braved the altitude and elements at the Southern Conference Championships last weekend in Boone, but finished
a disappointing ninth, tallying only four points. Dan Dearing scored Davidson’s only points, placing fourth in the javelin.

The real story of the meet was the arctic conditions in which it was run. The team arrived Friday to
find the meet delayed due to ice on the track and temperatures hovering in the 30s. Strong winds on Friday
dropped the wind chill down into the 20s. Saturday was much of the same.

“There were a lot of solid performances considering the conditions,” said coach Gary Andrew. “With the weather and altitude it
is tough to compare to previous meets.”

Dearing’s longest throw of 169 feet, seven inches was good enough for fourth. “The weather definitely affected most of our
performances, but all the teams ran in the same weather,” said the sophomore, who now owns six of the top
ten javelin throws in school history.

Despite the conditions, the Wildcats were able to muster season-best performances in some other events. Ken Howard ran the best
time all year in the 800 meters, coming in at 1:59.4. In the 100, Steve Hsieh ran a season-best 11.59
seconds. And Eugene Jung had season-best throws in both the shot put and discus, with distances of 40 feet, 2
3/4 inches and 112 feet, 7 inches, respectively.

VMI won the conference championship with 132.33 points, followed by Western Carolina with 103 points and Marshall with 102. VMI’s
win extended the VMI-Appalachian St. dominance of outdoor track, as the teams have split the last 20 outdoor championships.

The track team loses only two seniors next year, Jung and Dave Foss. “We are going to miss Eugene and
Dave, but we return most of our team,” said Dearing. “Next year looks good for us. Hopefully, we’ll get some
people scoring at conference.”

“As we continue to get more experience, we will become more competitive in conference,” added Andrew. “We are a young
team, and we need to build from this experience and continue to get better.”

**Baseball pushes for 20-win season as seniors finish careers**

“Well,” Joyce explained. “They traditionally keep the score low against us. They just did their job on Friday.”

For the Wildcats, the focus shifts to the final two games of the season - Tuesday’s Senior Day game against
Wake Forest at Wildcat Park and Thursday’s season finale versus Wofford in Spartanburg, S.C. give the squad its first 20-win
season since 1994.

“That would be a great way to end our senior season if we could beat them (Wake) on Senior Day,”
said Quattlebaum, speaking for the team’s nine other fourth-year players. “Coach (Dick) Cooke wants to play as many seniors as
possible. Not many coaches would do that.”

“We’re definitely pushing for 20 wins,”and we can get there with our seniors in,” added Joyce. “We’ll have a few
juniors and sophomores helping out, but our seniors can do the job. They won’t be going out there just to
say goodbye.”
