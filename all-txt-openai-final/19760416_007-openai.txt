Confession Machisto

An object of adoration

...ah, an object...

this wonderful thing

claws through the day

to purr soft and still the night
whisper

the rise of bleeding dawn.
Look,

temple, clay and brush

reach and fail

to snare the ruby flame an i
of diffidence

in and out of passion
flicking.
spun from leagues

of promise and desire.
Worship. Despair.
Subjugate,

they claim us in
fertility

tearing out the new.

mad goddess

chastise the old.

Play hard,

soft ones

our heat to layer

the cold

barren fields.

Destroy

in these timeless seconds

know the scent

of lust

in ecstasy.

Veil the wound.

Hours of the sun

cry her
a girl.

Minutes

lost in stars

taste her
a woman.

Moments between

when nothing moves or lingers

is she only,
mine.
Solo mio.
