Carson Talks: Sponsors For Pan-Hellenic Dance Physics Fraternity Bids On Insurance

Six Men to Membership Here Tonight

Commerce Club Listens to Distinguished Guest

Sigma Pi Sigma Initiates Five

Sigma Pi Sigma, honorary physics fraternity, held its initiation of new members Monday at six P.M., in Cham

At its regular weekly meeting tonight, the Commerce Club will have as guest speaker Mr. McAlister Carson, the founder and
builder of a large insurance agency for industrial Charlotte and the surrounding territory. Mr. Carson was a student of Davidson
College during the World War days. Mr. Carson’s talk will consider all branches of insurance other than life insurance, and
it will show their relations to business in general. At the conclusion of the talk there will be an open
forum discussion in which Mr. Carson will clarify any questions in the mind of the club members.

In the last meeting Mr. Eichelberger spoke in the absence of Mr. P. H. Efird, who found it impossible to
be present. Mr. Eichelberger, who is Mr. Efird’s assistant, explained the business principles of the large department stores, made up
of southern universities and a few colleges among which Davidson has a place. In the next meeting it is hoped
that either Mr. Clarence Keuster, Secretary of the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce, or Mr. David Ovens, business manager of Ivey's
Department Store, will be the guest speaker. Both men have expressed a desire to speak in the near future.

Holiday Observed By Scabbard and Blade

A special meeting of Scabbard and Blade, national honorary military fraternity, was held last Wednesday for the purpose of celebrating
the birth of the fraternity. This meeting was held at the same time as the 78 other chapters over the
country. Jim Wilson, Captain of “A” Company of the local battalion, gave a talk on the life of Theodore Roosevelt
as an officer of the army.

Papers Placed On Exhibition

Mr. Chalmers Davidson, director of the library, has placed on exhibition in the library four editions of old Davidsonians that
were published during the World War days. The date of the first edition exhibited is April 1st, 1914. This edition
is concerned mostly with a visit that President Martin, former president of the college, made to President Woodrow Wilson, who
attended school here for a year. President Martin, through the kindness of Senator Overman, secured an interview with President Wilson.
