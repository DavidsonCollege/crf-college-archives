Bond is back and Pop Films has him. Showing this Friday, two of the best Bonds, Dr. No and Diamonds are Forever, are interesting in that they are Sean Connery’s first and last efforts (to date anyway—a new Bond—Never Say Never Again—is scheduled for release in June). They present not only a changing actor but a changing world.

Let me start this review by telling you that I’m a true James Bond fan. Yes, I know—they’re violent, sexist, sadistic, often preposterous epics, but there’s no denying, whether you’re male or female, that it’s great fun watching this English gent go through all of his black and white shenanigans.

**Dr. No**, the first and probably best Bond, is a classic thriller. Set in Jamaica, the story concerns a certain Dr. No and his efforts to thwart a NASA project at “the cape.” But neither he nor his band of hitmen (three blind mice—indeed), spiders, and beautiful femme fatales have counted on our man from London—ultra debonair James Bond. The film moves at a TV-commercial-like clip to a rousing finale, and James ends up in the arms of someone he hadn’t counted on, Ursula Andress, easily the most beautiful victim of Bondage ever.

In his first outing as “Shames,” Connery is quite good. Like the rest of the film, he’s amazingly unpretentious, with his youthful spirit and bushy eyebrows, and it works. Ursula Andress gives the performance of her otherwise dismal career as the childlike beauty Honey Chile Rider. Don’t ask. As Dr. No, Joseph Wiseman is a real standout. Fleming’s book describes the good doctor as a tall, thin Chinese man with artificial limbs and eyes like bullet holes. Wiseman fits this description perfectly and was also at a peak in his short-lived career (easy to see why—how many parts are there for a guy with a mug like that?). He is truly menacing. Maurice Binder’s surrealistic titles pale in comparison to his later efforts, but they must have had an effect on the audience in 1962. The sex and violence must have made an impression as well—Dr. No was a box-office bonanza, starting a Bondmania second in popularity only to Beatlemania.

**Movie Reviews with Morris the Meek**

In defense of the James Bond films, I might say that one never laughs with violence and sex. The audience laughs at it. Which gets right down to a perfect definition of a James Bond Film: mindless, entertaining spoofs—and what’s wrong with that?

Spoof is definitely a word that can apply to Connery’s last Bond film, **Diamonds are Forever**. By 1971, the James Bond films were the most popular series in the world, but when Connery left because of artistic differences, the films started to slide into oblivion. Nothing a little wheeling and dealing couldn’t cure, reasoned producers Albert Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, thus Connery was brought back to the fold one more time to make Diamonds are Forever. By now the Bond movies had become slick, glossy formula thrillers with first-rate talents behind the camera and in front of it, and thanks to these talents, plus some very clever plot twists, Diamonds are Forever remains the most enjoyable James Bond film, even though it is similar to Fleming’s novel in name only.

**North by Northwest**, the stylish Alfred Hitchcock thriller, arrives at Davidson Saturday night.at 8:00. Hitchcock always said this was his favorite film, and I agree. North by Northwest just bubbles over with Hitchcockian touches featuring Alfred at his best and a cast of marvelous performers. The wickedly exciting (and hilarious) plot follows martini-sodden Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) through a series of framings and mixed identities until he finds himself up to his neck in murder, espionage, and Eva Marie Saint. The film proceeds from one startlingly suspenseful sequence to another as Grant seeks to prove his innocence in the face of attacking planes, cars, spies, and sheriffs. The finale, atop Mt. Rushmore of all places, is a Hitchcock tour de force with plenty of vertigo shots and hair-raising camera angles that dance across George Washington’s nose.

North by Northwest's appealing acting ensemble complements the superb direction in every way. Cary Grant’s half-suave, half-pathetic, always uncomfortable Thornhill evokes the Kafkaesque dilemma of the little man trying to figure out the big world. Eva Marie Saint, in her earlier days, was quite a creature (and not a bad actress either) and she does a lot with a character that could have been cardboard. James Mason is even more hideous than Captain Nemo and Leo G. Carroll is effective in his small supporting role. What makes North so special is that it eschews tedious plot development (which would belabor many an Alfred epic later) and instead inserts fun, nonsensical modern satire. The famous sequence where Cary Grant runs from a cropduster is, on one level, exciting, supercharged Hitchcock suspense, and on another, an existentialist’s nightmare. Roger Thornhill—the world-weary ad man—runs from an unknown (and therefore unwanted) evil. Will he survive? Hitchcock pokes not only at the nervous system but at the brain, and North by Northwest really works. Don’t miss this wonderful movie, and R.E.M. fans (myself included) don’t worry—John Munson promises North by Northwest will be over before they hit the scene.

Lolita (1962)
Directed by Stanley Kubrick. Based on the novel by Vladimir Nabokov. Starring James Mason, Peter Sellers, Sue Lyon, Marianne Stone, Diana Decker. Showing: 7:30 at Perkins. Admission is free. Rating: ***

On a first reading, Vladimir Nabokov’s provocative novel Lolita seems unadaptable for the screen, and to a large extent it is. Literally every sentence contains some sort of metaphor to other works and the reader needs almost a complete library of every important author of the last three (or maybe four) centuries to begin to comprehend its meaning. Well, in 1962, the genius director Stanley Kubrick decided to face this challenge, and his movie almost works. Primarily it benefits from some great performances by James Mason, Peter Sellers, and Shelly Winters, and they carry much of this weighty effort.

The plot, at first glance, appears to be some leftover material from a Russ Meyer porno film. Humbert Humbert, a lonely, confused bachelor, falls in love with sexually inviting, 14-year-old Lolita (Sue Lyon), at least 30 years his junior. The plot thickens (and thins) as Lolita’s sex-starved mother, brilliantly played by Shelly Winters, thinks many of Humbert’s affections are directed to her. And Quilty (played expertly by the overlooked dramatic actor Peter Sellers), the other man in Lolita’s life, causes problems for this unusual romance. As with most Kubrick films, a lot is left to the viewer’s imagination and parts of Lolita are just bizarre. This is weak Stanley Kubrick, yet still well worth seeing, although the quintessential Kubrick film premieres next week: Dr. Strangelove.

West Side Story (1961)
Directed by Robert Wise. Starring Natalie Wood, Russ Tamblyn, George Chakiris, Simon Oakland. Rating: ***

Here it is again—the uneven, bloated, occasionally moving Leonard Bernstein musical. Anyway, it made lots of money.
