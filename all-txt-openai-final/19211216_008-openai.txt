EUMENEANS DISCUSS TREATY BETWEEN U. S. AND FRANCE

adopt the treaty of alliance with France negotiated by President Wilson and agreed to by England.” The affirmative was upheld
by McCluer and McJunkin, while Sharpe and Young upheld the negative. America’s duty to France and the world was advanced

“THE LARGEST SERVICE TO THE LARGEST NUMBER”

This Season Make It Something That Will Be An Addition To The Home

The best gift you can possibly give Mother this Christmas, or any other one for that matter, is going to
give her the pleasure and satisfaction as will something for her home.

An attractive home suggests and encourages home entertainment, and she will be proud to have her cultured friends come and
enjoy its comforts and its beauty.

The furniture that you present her with need not be pretentious. In fact, it may be very modest, but if
in good taste, however inexpensive, it will breathe an atmosphere of welcome and cordiality, which after all is the highest
purpose of good furniture.

With these important thoughts in mind regarding what you are going to give Mother, don’t you believe that furniture is
the sensible gift?
