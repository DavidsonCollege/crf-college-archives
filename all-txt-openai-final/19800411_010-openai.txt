Sports Scripts
Individual sailors excel

Davidson's intercollegiate sailing team finished third in the Duke Points Regatta held at Kerr Lake this past Saturday. On Sunday, another Cat sailing contingent could do no better than sixth in an invitational hosted by Clemson University.

In the Kerr Lake competition, Kirk Williams and Don Rose skippered their A and B division vessels to identical third place finishes which understandably left Davidson in third place overall. David Lyons and Bill Bankhead served as crew members for the Cat skippers. Ned Grier and Stuart Baskin guided their crafts to respective sixth and fourth place finishes in the Clemson Invitational. Some sailing score manipulation left Davidson in sixth place overall, however. Crew members for Grier and Baskin included Jeff Harris and Donya Boylston.

Next weekend finds the sailors on Lake Norman for an Invitational; Davidson will serve as the host-team.

Soccer overpowered

The Davidson Women’s Soccer “A” Team journeyed to Duke last week to challenge a strong club team but lost 2-0.

Both teams played hard and well, but Davidson was outnumbered on the bench with only one substitute compared to 7 for Duke. A goal early in the game put Davidson behind 1-0, and though the Cat defense was tight, Duke scored again in the final minutes to wrap the game up 2-0. Davidson put up a good fight, with outstanding performances by striker Joanna Fleming and back Kirsten McDonald. The next two sets of games will be played this weekend at home.

Netters coast to tourney

The men’s tennis team shellacked the 49ers of UNCC 6-0 last Thursday to run its record to 7-5 on the year. The impressive win should provide needed momentum for the Cats as they head into important Southern Conferences matches this weekend.

A quadrangular match hosted by Furman is scheduled for this weekend. On Friday, the Cats take on Furman, the Conference's leading squad. Saturday morning has the Cats challenging University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, currently in third place; and Saturday afternoon Marshall provides the opposition.

Coach Jeff Frank is receiving strong play from Jeff Lyle and Jim Haynes who seem to be getting their respective acts together. Also, the doubles combination of Aller Lazenby and Rick Johnston are coordinating their games better and should pick up some key wins as the season wears on.
