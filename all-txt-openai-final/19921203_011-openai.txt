DAVIDSON WILDCATS

Semifinal Game Two
Davidson Wildcats vs. San Diego Toreros

Coach Slagle:
"It's great to be playing in the Final Four, whether it's at home or not. Being at home, obviously, it
makes it a little more special; it also makes a lot of extra work for us — great work —
no complaints. San Diego's an excellent team. If you look at where they've come from, it's very similar, it's sort
of a mirror of Davidson. Both teams were under .500 last year, but played great schedules. This year things have
clicked. Both teams have played good schedules, have played great teams, and have done well.”

Coach McFadden:
"We're very happy to be here and happy for Davidson too because they're hosting and I know their coach has
done an excellent job. We're really the two Cinderella teams of the tournament. We're pretty comparable because we know our
limitations. I heard that other teams are bringing their bands and things, but we've got our feet on the ground
and we're happy to be here. I expect a hell of a game from Davidson. They're a very talented team
and they've worked hard and deserve what they've gotten. We're the same type of team.”
