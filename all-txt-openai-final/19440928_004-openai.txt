THIS and THAT
FROM THE ASTRP

crease of 200 per cent in the sale
of lipstick throughout the South.
One could easily understand this if
he were to get a close look at some
of the collars and handkerchiefs
which at one time were khaki—of
course there is always the same old
excuse, “She tripped and I caught
her.”

Now to get back to the present,
the boys have settled down to their
second and last term at Davidson.
There is much to be accomplished
and little time to do it in.

On the brighter side of the
ASTRP's life gleams Lois Collier,
our pin-up (Wow!). She is soon to
honor the ASTRP’s by her presence
at Davidson. The boys are looking
forward to this with great eagerness.
The day she arrives will be one of
the most exciting days we have ever
had at Davidson—except the day we
took the national achievement tests.
The ten Jivesters, those hep cats
of the ASTRP’s who are strictly
in the groove, have been making
quite a name for themselves: (?)
So far, they have been asked to play
for Lois Collier, and finally at Con-
cord Hotel October 17. The ten
Jivesters are as follows: D. J. Loar-
mina, L. A. Berretta, Z. A. Jeffords,
“Bird” Sanders, J. Brett, “C S”
Caldwell, W. A. Davis, “B H” Camp,
Joe Johnston, “T D” Chennig, and
last but not least the handy man
Jimmy Junior Mankira.

Well, Dear Readers, this is about
enough tripe for one time. Here's
hoping you digest this by next issue.

body expected for a moment that
here was a man in the making—a
man who was destined to carry the
world in his heart and mind, and
to move the world up toward the
ideal of peace as perhaps no other
human being has ever done. As a
great scholar, and as a Christian
man, through and through, he
wrought out his great convictions
and pled with the world to accept
them. He continues to haunt us.
Very much that he stood for will
ultimately prevail. Is it at all un-
likely that there are here today
students who, because of noble heri-
tage and Christian upbringing, of
native talent, and of strong person-
ality, are destined also to assume
places of large leadership in the days
that are to come. To that end let
us set our faces, dedicate our lives,
and go forward.”

Thirty-four days were spent on the open sea in a rubber boat by three
U. S. Navy men, Harold Dixon, Gene Aldrich, and Anthony
Pastula. After waiting torturous days under the blazing sun, and finally
being rescued, they were true heroes. These rubber boats, so buy as many War Bonds as you
can. You've done your bit; now do your best!
