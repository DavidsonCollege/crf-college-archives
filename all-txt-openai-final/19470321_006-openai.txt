Essential, Jackson grasped the open bomb bay doors with two extended fingers and hauled himself slowly, painfully back into the fuselage of the furiously burning plane. Realizing that quick action was essential to avert tragedy, the young major kicked the cravett cadet out into space and bailed out himself. As he passed down through the open bomb bay doors a horrifying sight was burned upon his brain: a parachute whose straps were inextricably tangled with the struts of the plane.
