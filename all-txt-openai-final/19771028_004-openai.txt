Take Wooden’s message to heart

Ken Wooden’s message was horrible. For most of us who were unaware of the problem of child abuse, his message
snapped us out of our small worries over grades and parties and gave us a new perspective about our world.

What is just as despicable as the child abuse problem itself is the inexcusable inaction of Congress, the FBI, and
the Postal Service.

I know it’s been said about a hundred issues but: we urge you to write your Congressman. It’s been said
so many times the plea has become a cliché. But most clichés are founded in truth.

If every member of the Davidson College community were to write his Congressman urging him to act on legislation to
end child abuse, maybe our voices will be heard.

So many times we feel as though we as individuals are helpless to affect change. We can view Wooden as
a figure of hope.

Despite all the horror Wooden’s message brings, he exemplifies one man affecting change by making every organization he can reach
aware of the horrible problem of child abuse.

Think about how much easier his job would be if we got behind him. I hope we all as individuals
and as a community will be inspired enough to write.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor:

An editorial in last week’s Davidsonian expressed great regret about the reasons the Admissions Office changed the rooming assignments of
two prospective students. Some of our students have expressed concern and I decided I should make two comments:

1) The Admissions Office has no particular policy in regard to this matter but the members of the staff will
be glad to discuss the matter with anyone who would like to discuss it.
2) All things considered, I am sorry we have handled that particular situation as we did.

H.E. White
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid

We reserve the right to edit letters over 300 words in length. Letters received in The Davidsonian offices by Sunday
night will ordinarily be printed that week.

Cabaret is showing tonight. Tomorrow several Davidson students have reviews. Many of those students will not be able to see
the play because they feel they must study.

There was no need for this situation to occur. Cabaret was scheduled in July. If faculty members would look at
the Union calendar before they planned each term, conflicts like these could be avoided. These Friday tests could have been
postponed until Monday without too much difficulty.

Homecoming, Midwinters, and Spring Frolics weekends should be treated with similar consideration. And Monday reviews after these weekends should be
moved to Tuesday.

We know Davidson is not a party school. The main business here is education. But studying is not the only
way to get an education. If studying were not balanced with cultural events such as Cabaret or pleasurable releases such
as the big weekend parties, our education would be seriously lopsided.

Checking the Union calendar would not tax the faculty members so much. Davidson is small enough to allow for a
little consideration.
