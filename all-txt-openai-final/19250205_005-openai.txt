THE DAVIDSONIAN

Davidsonian’s First Cross-Word Puzzle Proves Success---

Bill Story, of shiekish fame, was the first successful solver of the cross-word puzzle that appeared in The Davidsonian of
January 15th. He brought the correct solution into the editor at four bells and for his skill in acrostics and
phrasing, he receives the prize of one subscription to the livest college weekly in the South. Frank Hudson, Bill Mattison,
Arthur Gray, and several others brought their solutions in just a little later. The complete list has been lost, although
the intention was to give each one honorable mention who brought in the correct solution. Almost all the boys sent
the puzzle to their girls, who no doubt ran delicate fingers through their bobbed tresses while trying to unfathom the
mysterious words that wouldn't fit. Among those who solved the puzzle were Misses Po Rudisill, Frank Rudisill, Don Smoot, Virginia
Batte, and Lloyd Merriman, all of N. C. C. W.; Miss Mildred Bushart, of Union City, Tenn.; Miss Mozelle Horton,
of Converse College, and others whose names could not be secured. The puzzler this week was laboriously ground out by
Kenneth “Ding-dong” Bell. It is the plan of the editors to have different fellows make up these puzzles from week
to week. By applying to the editor, or managing editor, blanks for the puzzle can be secured. The puzzle this
week is not so hard but is catchy. Try your skill in filling the little squares. Here goes.

WILDCAT BASEBALL (Continued from page 1)

on April 23rd. Then the Wildcats will start on their big trip of the season which will include games with
Guilford on April 29th, Roanoke College on April 30th, V. P. I. on May 1st, and Washington and Lee on
May 4th. On returning from their trip Coach Monk's men will encounter Wake Forest at Davidson on May 8th, and
Duke at Gastonia on the 9th, thus ending the season. The only changes this year’s schedule makes over last year’s
is the substituting of Elon for Lenoir-Rhyne and the Virginia trip for one in South Carolina, thus playing Roanoke, V.
P. I., and W. and L., instead of P. C., Furman and University of South Carolina. It would be impossible
to predict the outcome of the season at such an early date, but with a good number of letter men
back and last year’s Freshman team to start with, Coach Monk should round out a creditable team. The schedule includes
many games and will call for the best Davidson can put out.

D. Patterson, Sims, L. M. McCutcheon, Crinkley, Forbes, and “Sock” Gibbs are in charge of the Sunday School service at
Shearer Chapel Sunday, February 1st. Each of these boys teaches a class of young people and reports the attendance unusually
good. Gibbs is in charge of the work at Shearer, and during the three years that he has been there,
interest in attendance has been noticed. The other men have been going from one to all and find the work
interesting. After the three years were completed, the Sabbath School service was followed by a stirring address at the regular
church service by Bowie. During his three years of hard work, Bowie has preached in a number of churches in
the territory surrounding Davidson, C.E.T.C. D.C.

“Junior Societies and Their Work” was the topic discussed at the Christian Endeavor Training Class last Sunday. Three talks were
given to show the working of the Junior Society both in the regular meetings and on the outside. This topic
was in line with the preparation program for the deputations which are to be sent out by the Training Class
in the next few months. C.F. McRae, in talking on “The Why and How of Junior Christian Endeavor,” told of
the importance of this work among the children. At this age, impressions are formed, and children are most easily influenced.
If they are taught the principles of Christianity and the practical application of them at this time, no concern need
be felt as to their conduct when older. Taking up the meeting, Wallace Purdy outlined the scope of the meeting
and the methods used in keeping up interest. Suggestions were also given as to variations in the program. Davis discussed
the work of the society outside of regular weekly meetings, which includes work on the outside, such as socials, helping
the pastor of the church, and getting members. One deputation was sent to Cornelius by the class this week. This
is the first deputation since Christmas, and several more are to be sent out in the next few weeks.

The many friends of Miss Clara Smith will be glad to know that her condition is improving steadily. All hope
that she will be restored soon to her large circle of warm friends.

The General Electric Company provides for agriculture little motors that do the farm chores and great ones that operate mammoth
pumps to irrigate vast stretches of arid valleys. If you are interested in learning more about what electricity is doing,
write for Reprint No. AR391 containing a complete set of these advertisements. Irrigation by electrically driven pumps has made hundreds
of thousands of acres of desert land in the Intermountain West blossom like the rose. For a few cents a
month per acre, electricity—the giant worker—brings the life-giving water from distant lakes and rivers to rainless valleys, producing rich harvests
of fruits and vegetables, cereals, and forage. What electricity is doing for the farmer is only a counterpart of what
it is doing for Industry, Transportation, City and Country life, or any of the professions. It is a tool ready
for your use and which, wisely used, will make the impossible of today an accomplished fact tomorrow.
