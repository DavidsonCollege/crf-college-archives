April 3, 1975. The Davidsonian

Five Blatant Propaganda Smears

By THOM NICHOL

The last issue of the Davidson Update claims on page one, "We’re No. 1 in Art." The headline on page four retreats a little: "We’re Number One in Prints and Drawings." In the text, the hyperbole is relieved: we have the largest print and drawing competition in the country.

The point I hope to make concerns the Update, but first I want to digress into the question of Davidson and Art. As far as I can tell, art has always been a stepchild of the Davidson tradition, largely tolerated when not ignored. The art department and art major are relatively quite young. Art has very little to do with the traditional formation of a Davidson man. Art challenges values, it is not systematic or reducible, it can be anarchic, it is non-discursive, it does not improve GRE scores or medical school acceptances. It is painful to think of how far from Number One in art Davidson is. Davidson makes Bob Jones University look like Florence, Italy.

Davidson’s art program is as good as it is because people like Herb Jackson have forced it to be, in spite of the hostile environment. I am sure that Professor Jackson appreciated the administration’s pat on the back for his hard work and for the success of the National, but I imagine that he would prefer that they give him a place to display Davidson’s permanent collection—Chamber’s Banquet Hall, for instance. To my knowledge, the administration has simply allowed that urgent plea to die from neglect.

The Update treatment of art is only one instance of a general tendency to accentuate the positive and to wish the negative out of existence. In other words, to ignore the real. This is not necessarily a failing, because the Update, "The Official Newspaper of Davidson College," is not intended to be an objective reporter.

Diligent Senators Deserve Attention

There are a number of Senators who do not receive headlines, but who work hard and enjoy their present positions. In 1944, one of these senators was a fellow named Harry Truman. Truman felt he had found a satisfying position in the Senate and looked no higher. His obtaining the Vice Presidency and the Presidency was not completed by his desires and efforts.

The quiet senators are not all hardworking, but a hardworking fairly low-profile senator should receive attention. No one is building a campaign base for William Proxmire (D-Wis.), one of the hardest working members of the Senate. Proxmire is an individual who jogs miles to work, foils hold-up men who have tried to rob him on two occasions, gets hair transplants, fights for frugality in government spending, and praises the Pentagon when it does cut costs. He is an alert, intelligent, and energetic person. No one is beating the drum for Proxmire.

On the other hand, Senator Lloyd Bentson (D-Tex.) was being touted for President the first day of his election as a senator. Most of us are uninvolved enough not to consider how a millionaire insurance-real estate man becomes a Presidential contender so quickly. Perhaps the key ingredient is ambition. Lloyd Bentson served in Congress for a while and tired of it. His life does not show an involvement with national or international issues (with the exception of banking). While election laws may regulate the amount of spending in a campaign, they do not control money spent on a recognized campaign. Interviews, television appearances, press conferences, etc., have not served to educate Senator Bentson on our problems, but they have given us exposure to him.

Senator Bentson has never exuded charisma, never appeared committed to any philosophy, and yet after a brief stay in the Senate, he offers himself as a presidential candidate. A man should not be refused office because he is ambitious, but it should not be his main quality. It may be extremely difficult to get into the United States Senate without being ambitious. However, there are levels of ambitiousness.

ARA Ticket System Burdens

Recently the ARA Slater Food Service, prompted by financial reverses due to rising prices, looked for a way to recoup losses. Food Service Director Ron Scott called together a group of students to discuss the problem. Several alternatives were explained by Scott, and the students left with the impression that he planned to close Rusk House for the remainder of spring term.

During the course of the meeting, one issue came up which was of interest to me—the fate of freshmen women under the meal ticket system. Looking at any announcement sheet under the For Sale category you will never fail to notice, "Meal Tickets: Very Cheap. Call Watts 155 and ask for Mary." Freshmen with smaller appetites, many but not all of them women, are forced to pay for many more meal tickets than they could possibly use. This can be quite a financial burden on some parents.

In order to find out what the freshmen inhabitants of Watts really felt about the meal ticket system and the closing of Rusk House, I took a poll last Monday. Forty-two girls, almost half of the number in Watts, responded. The closing of Rusk House would not change their eating habits substantially. They eat an average of 1.3 times per week at Rusk, and more than half virtually never eat there. However, the majority objected to the closing of Rusk House, many citing the overcrowding of the other two houses. When asked if they would prefer the closing of Rusk to a hike in price of 10% at all houses, the vast majority preferred the closing of Rusk.

When asked about the selling of meal tickets, many women expressed discontentment with the current system.have sold an average of eight meal tickets per person this year, but many people said that they would have sold more if they could have gotten a higher price for them. Several people on financial aid felt that the meal tickets placed a hardship on them. All heed one of the women polled.

1.) How many meals per week, on the average, do you eat at Rusk House? An average of 1.3.
2.) Would you object to the closing of Rusk House?
   Yes: 27
   No: 15
3.) Would you prefer the closing of Rusk House to a 10 percent price hike at all of the houses?
   Yes: 37
   No: 5
4.) Would you eat at Rusk, if, for the same price, seconds were eliminated?
   Yes: 4
   No: 38
5.) How many meal tickets have you sold this year? An average of 8, but as high as 10.

Women reacted to ARA Slater Food Service and indicated they would like more salads and dietetic foods. There were many exclamation marks after the responses to this question. They were asked about two alternatives to the meal ticket system. They overwhelmingly rejected the conversion of the food service system to a cash basis. The other suggestion was the option for freshmen to take a mini-plan.

6.) Would you prefer to buy food from ARA on a cash basis?
   Yes: 4
   No: 38
7.) If incoming freshmen were given the option of buying a mini-plan, consisting of fewer meal tickets per year, would you take the mini-plan?
   Yes: 37
   No: 5
8.) Would you benefit from an increase in the diversity and amount of salads and other low-calorie foods?
   Yes: 39
   No: 1
9.) Are you satisfied with the present food service arrangement at ARA?
   Yes: 10
   No: 30
   No Answer: 1

It is hard to get people to give their money to us, a worthy enough end, I suppose, because we undoubtedly need a lot of money. My quarrel is with the means, rather than the end. I shall soon be a Davidson alumnus, God willing. This will make me prey to those PR fellows who will be after my money. Every couple of months I shall receive an Update and read of Davidson’s “position as one of the country’s leading art colleges,” of its brilliant professors and brilliant students. I shall admire the photos of Davidson’s comeliest co-eds, and I shall be invited to Alumni Weekend, Homecoming, etc., “for lots of back-slapping reunions, and a potful of fun and entertainment.” In short, I shall be reassured constantly that Davidson is everything it claims to be, and more.

I do not anticipate having any cash to give Davidson for a number of years, if ever. If I ever do give to Davidson, it will be in spite of their propaganda, not because of it. At least I hope that I shall still have enough critical intelligence left at that time to remember the discrepancy between the Davidson I read about and the one that I know. I genuinely like the real Davidson, with all of its peculiarities and sins, but it has little in common with the image the Alumni Office creates. I can speak only for myself, and perhaps eventually I shall end up romanticizing my experience of Davidson to the point of accepting the Update’s picture of things. I would suggest, however, that a publication which attempted to be more realistic and down-to-earth, and less the journalistic back-slapping variety, would come closer to eliciting my sympathy and funds. Perhaps they could at least be a little more subtle in their promotion.

I concede that I may be entirely wrong on the effectiveness of more or less blatant propaganda. In any case, Davidson is not number one in art, and I resent such a claim by the organ of an administration which will not respond to a desperate need for gallery space.

A large majority of the women said that they would have liked to be able to opt to buy fewer meal tickets. When asked if they approved of the overall performance of the Slater meal system, the majority replied that they did not like it. This survey dealt with the freshman women who are a relatively new phenomenon on the Davidson campus. They felt that the meal services were geared toward the men. They could not pay for only the amount of food they wanted and could not eat the foods they wanted. I believe that Ron Scott could make an accurate approximation of the number of freshmen who would want the mini-plan. Next year, due to the large number of upperclassmen who will be independent, the ARA houses will be crowded anyway, so I doubt that the mini-plan would cause ARA to lose any money. Upperclassmen can go to a cash basis or simply pay more for their meal tickets. It is unfair to force the freshmen to subsidize the upperclassmen. In addition, this system would lead to less waste. Some freshmen buy more food than they really want simply because they have so many extra tickets.

Even if larger, long-range changes are not made, it would be relatively easy to give us some of the food we want. A complete salad bar at a reasonable cost would be a good start. The women at Davidson aren’t asking for preferential treatment, and we don’t want it. What we want is a chance for equal treatment. It is time that ARA realized that this is now a coed school.
