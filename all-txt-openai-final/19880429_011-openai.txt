**Arrogance, not issues, is the problem at Davidson**

**Taylor Mayo**

Alright, here we go. These words flow onto a screen from a keyboard punched by fingers which act upon signals from a (hopefully) rational mind. Attached to the fingers by an arm, the torso wears a shirt adorned with, (or defiled by, depending on your point of view), a peculiar symbol of the Greek type. The symbol virtually explodes with energy and works constantly to crush the individual mind which controls the keyboard. For this reason, the bias of the mind and the intentions of the words must be questioned thoroughly. This condition necessitates your concern and begs your reactions to the opinions which appear hereafter. Please, listen to hear.

The academic environment which we presently create and experience suffers from an intellectually-agitated disease. Its symptoms are commonly noticed: disenchantment and bitterness, drug abuse, vandalism, anger and a general sort of bad feeling among college community members. Not all symptoms show up in all cases, but very few Davidsonians escape some degree of infection. This disease has a cure difficult to swallow. For that reason, I believe, most Davidsonians seek individual comfort by addressing one or two of the symptoms rather than the disease itself. Such a course of action is not necessarily wrong, if one puts faith in a dog-eat-dog societal outlook. As the method of treatment currently progresses, one case gets better at the expense of agitating another. Why this strange relationship? Because, like it or not, we belong to a community—and disease spreads quickly in our environment.

Rather than bore you with the scientifics, I call this disease Compound Arrogance. It comes in many forms, including: a superior attitude among those who do not consume alcohol or other drugs with regard to those who do; the same among fraternity members toward independents; the same among independents toward fraternity members; professors toward students, and vice-versa; in general—people against people. We certainly brag about our diversity, our wonderful student-teacher ratio, and our intellectual environment—but do we use these potential blessings effectively? We give prospectives a reliable picture of Davidson, correct? The answer is in some cases, unfortunately, no.

Truthfully, arrogance infects all communities to varying degrees. It should not make us, as members of this community, overly upset that we have not broken those bonds which make us human. Nevertheless, arrogance demands attention and concern when it takes such powerful forms as those now exhibited at Davidson College. The disease spreads wild here, in other words; it is compounded by our high intellectual capabilities. While teaching and learning how to lecture, write, discuss, experiment and explore, we often lose sight of our obligation to help each other get along. This responsibility is often twisted into something else: namely, a demon called arrogance and its offspring, the blind opinions.

Am I my sister’s keeper? Yes, I am. Am I not then her superior commander? NO! We have an obligation to help one another without seriously infringing on each other’s rights. Acting solely upon one’s opinions does not cut it when dealing with others; rather, one must make a heartfelt effort to listen AND to hear. Many important decisions and changes are currently influencing the life of our community. I sincerely hope open-mindedness takes a firmer hold on the individuals responsible. Anti-fraternity, anti-alcohol, anti-social, anti-independent, anti-student apathy, anti-academic pressure, anti-football, anti-trustee and anti-whatever else sentiments represent important issues in the Davidson “experience.” If we do not alter our tendency to act in limited and opinionated ways, and if we cannot work together a bit more tolerantly, then I am afraid we are all missing the point of a liberal arts education.

There is plenty to work for out in the world: fighting hunger, seeking peace and more advanced international relations, and simply trying to grow as individuals. If we cannot open our minds a bit more while at college, what in God’s name are we doing here? Too many stones have been cast this year; excuse me, but I'd like to check the slates.

**US involvement is appropriate response to Panamanian crisis**

**David Host**

Despite increasing economic pressure from the United States, Panamanian dictator General Manuel Antonio Noriega remains in control. He has managed to break “a Washington-backed general strike” and intimidate “selected opposition leaders and foreign journalists.” Therefore, the effort of the United States to remove Noriega from power through economic means would appear to have failed.

One reason for this failure appears to involve the nature of Noriega’s military control over Panama. In mid-March, a split had seemed to develop in the Panamanian Defense Forces when an unsuccessful uprising occurred against Noriega. Noriega, however, “purged his top officer corps,” resulting in “the Defense Forces... exercising more power than ever.” This military structure has not suffered from the economic sanctions, and it retains its strength from elements which benefit economically from its control. The United States persists, however, in choosing “economic options” while sending “1300 additional troops” in consideration of “military options.” The entrenched nature of Noriega and his military suggests that a movement towards more American force is necessary. American interests in the region require an effort to fundamentally change the power structure of Panamanian society; or intervention.At first glance, the Panamanian crisis appeared as a “major interest” of the United States, as it appeared to harbor “potential serious harm” rather than the “probable serious harm to the security and well-being of the nation” that defines a “vital interest.” Other elements than Noriega exist which contribute to the infiltration of drugs into the United States, as well as other dictatorships in Central America which threaten long-term American security and economic interests in the region. American interests, however, may “shift” to the “vital” category as a result of events. American and Panamanian actions have forced this re-classification. Through its indictment of Noriega on drug charges, the United States has made Noriega an example of how it intends to deal with leaders who support the drug trade which threatens to undermine American society. Therefore, it must treat Noriega in uncompromising fashion. It cannot allow a “deal that would allow him to step down with some assurances of safety,” such as one that would allow his departure to asylum in a foreign country. Such an arrangement would encourage the leaders of other countries to engage in similar activities, expecting the United States to provide lenient terms upon exposing these activities. The “credibility” of the United States in dealing with criminals serves as the vital interest in this case. The United States has also made the ouster of Noriega a vital interest through its destabilization of Panamanian society. This destabilization attempt has led to a threat to American citizens in Panama. In addition, the United States has a critical “economic stake” in the security of the Panama Canal, which Noriega and Panamanian instability jeopardize. The United States must therefore direct its policy towards Panama to the immediate ouster of Noriega. Two options seem available. The first option involves direct, unilateral military intervention. Upon consideration of its costs, however, such an option becomes implausible. The United States would appear “to bully its neighbor.” It would experience great difficulty in obtaining regional support, as current regional censure of American policy indicates. In addition, such an invasion would leave a power vacuum in Panama, as current “opposition to the Noriega regime... is vast and diverse.” Instability would remain, as the United States will have paid no attention to “the shape a post-Noriega Panama will take.” The other option, increased economic sanctions such as a trade embargo even if it results in Noriega’s fall, will not solve the underlying problems of Panama. Without American involvement, the removal of Noriega might simply elevate others who are “far worse.” The same military power structure would elevate another military leader. In addition, it would “alienate those who oppose Noriega,” but also oppose the imposition of long-term suffering on Panamanians. The United States must therefore find an active means of deposing Noriega quickly without any “deals” while gaining the support of regional nations and Panamanians alike. It should require the Panamanians to participate in the military overthrow of Noriega. It should take into account the remaining popularity of the military despite opposition to Noriega. An effective plan would encourage another domestic military uprising. The United States would pledge full military support from its own forces, plus protection for the uprising’s leaders, in exchange for a pledge of democratic, civilian elections which would destroy the military stranglehold on Panamanian society. The United States could avoid “bullying” charges through the removal of its own influence after establishing a regional commission of democratic nations to oversee the transformation of Panamanian society into a democracy. Such a plan would cast the United States in the role of insurer of indigenous change instead of the imposer of change, as its offer of support would simply enable the Panamanians to achieve the popular goal of Noriega’s ouster. A free, stable Panama could then become a reality.
