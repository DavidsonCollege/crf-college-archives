### Land Of Tarzan Challenge

(ED Note: JYA in an African University such as Cape Town provides another alternative for students to travel and study abroad.)

Beginning in January of last year, I spent the last two terms of my junior year at the University of Cape Town in

Cape Town, South Africa. I decided on this University for a number of reasons.

First, the University is one of the finest in both Africa as well as the world. It has world-renowned facilities in Medicine, Anthropology, Engineering, Performing Arts, and African Studies.

Secondly, as in most former British African Countries, a large percentage of the population speaks English. Therefore, I didn’t have to learn a foreign language to study in the University or to travel.

Also, my family had the good fortune to have an American Field Service Student live with us in 1970, and he was attending the University of Cape Town at that time.

Finally, since I felt that any sort of study abroad should include travel, I was looking for a university with many holidays, which the University of Cape Town, like most African Universities, has.

The best way to describe my experience in Africa is to call it a “total education” experience. From the time I boarded the freighter which took me to Cape Town, until I left Cairo in September, I encountered very few things that were familiar.

I was exposed almost daily to a wide variety of different cultural and social activities which have no parallels in American life.

This exposure to a vastly different culture is the most beneficial part of a junior year abroad. It is not the classroom education (which in my case is exceptionally good) that is the most beneficial, but rather the day-to-day education that comes almost immeasurable.

The most exceptional part of any trip to Africa is the travel through nine African countries from barren Botswana in the Kalahari Desert, to Kenya, one of the fastest-growing countries in all of Africa.

A trip through Africa brings one into contact with such natural wonders as great game herds, beautiful mountains and huge plains, and striking rivers and falls. But it also brings one face to face with man's origin in tribal villages and man’s evolution in beautiful modern cities.

Because Africa contrasts these natural wonders with growth, activity, and pure promise, it offers a whole panorama of experience to anyone who truly appreciates the natural beauty and, more importantly, the challenge which Africa has to offer.

It isn’t a resort area ready-made for a vacation, it is rather a continent offering much to those who are willing to work for it.

Davidson has sent several students to various African Universities in the past and there are several there now. They went there seeking this same change and challenge.

If you are seeking an education that has change and challenge then consider a year or term studying in an African University or simply traveling in Africa.

I feel sure that you will agree with all of the students who have been there that it was the most beneficial experience of your life.

### Plain Facts Justify Nixon's Ousting

I have never been a strong supporter of Richard Nixon. It is with some reluctance, then, that I take issue with last week’s front-page editorial written by my distinguished colleague.

But there are several reasons why I find his call for impeachment unsatisfactory.

The editorial was clearly intended to be a work of inflammatory rhetoric and was possibly successful as such. But is this tone now justified? It may have been before the November election, when Nixon was happily hiding behind his army of tests and gulling the silent majority.

“Nixon is a liar and a crook who is presiding over the most corrupt and incompetent Administration in American history,” the editorial says. How easy is it for a person who voted for Nixon to accept this? Not very.

The case against Nixon is better served by an educated discussion of the facts. Ervin’s committee has not disappointed me and I do not think the courts will either. The simple facts of Watergate are relatively little and then to have been able to control by 1) serving a product of lesser quality, 2) removing certain products from the menu, and 3) reducing labor up to 5 percent.

Along with these measures, there has been a 2 percent reduction of direct expenditures in areas such as laundry service.

However, even when these cutbacks have been combined with the 8 percent increase in

There are never any major issues around here,” he said.

Scholer stressed the importance of student participation in the Senate.

“Students have to be more vocal and demand things. I'd personally be scared going against the administration here,” he said.

“I think the highest priority at Davidson in the way of new or improved facilities is for athletic facilities.

“We have poor facilities now.”

Scholer advocates a moratorium on plans for the construction of new dorms. “I don’t want to see financial reasons determining who gets a better room.”

Issues in Scholer’s platform include selling beer on campus, open dorms, continuation of the college union program, getting more students in voting committees, and abolition of parliamentary procedure in Senate meetings.

“Government is a simple thing or at least should be. I'd like to bring it back to that,” Scholer said.
