After dropping a pair of pre-Christmas tussles to Wofford and Duke, Coach Norman Shepard’s cagers have looked stronger in their
outings with McCrary, Maryland, and South Carolina. Since this was written before the State game Tuesday, we can’t include that
acid test.

WILDCATS TOP MARYLAND, S. CAROLINA
By GORDON SCOTT

Freshmen Maintain Last Tuesday night following Davidson's victory over Maryland, Coach Flucie Stewart’s Maryland quintet thought they had seen a
whale of a ball game. However, the Wildcats’ 64-53 thumping of the University of South Carolina Gamecocks Saturday made the
difference in these games. Shepard’s team has shown strength which has come from seemingly nowhere.

INTRODUCIN'
By CHERRY STRIBBLING

This week’s column is about Paul Whitlock Cobb, better known to Davidson students as Whit or “Sparky.” As everybody knows,
Whit is really “hoss” in the athletic life of Davidson. The slender six-footer has been a standout member of the
basketball squad. Last year he sparked the Cats to a berth in the conference tournament. He has consistently led the
floor game for the Cats and has shown amazing accuracy on his long push shots and also at the foul
line. Last year he was third high scorer behind Buddy Cheek and Mike Williams, pumping in 122 points for the
season. In tennis, he was a steady number six man on the once defeated Davidson tennis team. He won his
letter in track last year although he missed many of the meets because of conflicts between tennis and track.

Coach Norman Shepherd will be very grateful that Whit will still be around next year when the other stars are
lost by graduation. Whit is a business major but his main business in his spare time is thinking about Agnes
Scott College and a certain someone named Sara. He's certainly a hard-working fellow; here's a tribute to an all-around athlete
and a Davidson gentleman.

INTERFRAT GAMES
Six games were run off last week in the opening round of the interfraternity basketball tourney. Tuesday saw the frosh
play a good brand of ball as they added two more contests to their growing string of victories. The frosh
continued to show the prowess of Herndon who bucketed 12 points for the winners. Coleman and Osborne had 10 points,
respectively. Cooper Taylor had nine for the losers.

The Phi Delts and SAE clashed on Tuesday night. The Phi Delts nosed out the SAE by a score of
21-20. Hobbs Bennett sank 10 and Dave Erwin seven for the victors, while Lewis had eight for the SAE.

The Kappa Sigs nosed out the Betas in a thrilling 14-13 game. Bill Bird had five points for Kappa Alpha,
while Warlick had eight for the Betas.

On the same night, the KA squeezed by the ATOs to take a 14-13 game. Bill Bird had five points
