#### Reduced faculty workloads?

According to Dean of Faculty Robert Williams, the new policy reducing each professor’s course load to only five per year “brings Davidson into conformity with other colleges.” Fine. However, Davidson students and professors alike have long taken pride in the school’s unwillingness to fit the norm.

The matter seems a tricky one to us. Reducing the course load will no doubt have a ripple effect throughout the college, the foremost of which is the inevitable reduction of courses offered each semester. At a school as small as Davidson, where resources are limited by size and money, a wide range of interesting classes is already hard to come by. Even now it has been our experience that so few courses are being offered this semester, we find ourselves sticking with courses inside our major. Why? Because that is a subject we find interesting. To take something else, the subject matter must be enticing. And for an English major to be convinced to tackle a biology course takes a lot of enticing. And vice versa. The diversity of courses offered will only decrease.

The administration, for its part, has promised to find the money needed to hire more professors, and thus increase the diversity of courses to its original level. We, however, are yet to be convinced that increasing the number of professorships and keeping their required workload at a higher level is not a better option.

We must concede that we are far from well-versed in matters concerning such administrative affairs. But it seems that as students we have a right to understand why we are being forced to suffer the ills this new plan inherently brings with it. Perhaps the answer lies in the increased attention each professor will be able to pay to their respective duties. But who knows. Teachers are people, too, and free time is free time.

But the decision has already been made. And as is Davidson tradition, it takes quite some time to change a decision once it has been carried out, even if it is a bad one. Witness this year’s scheduling debacle. So we can only implore the administration and the professors to hold up their side of the bargain: do find the money to create new professorships, do spend more time with students, and do pay more attention to teaching. Judging by the standards of many of today's colleges and universities, there is no need to fit the norm.

**LETTERS**

**College shouldn't accept tobacco money.**

To the editors,

I am a 1977 graduate and President of the Virginia Group to Alleviate Smoking in Public (GASP). I am disturbed to read in the Davidson Journal that the college is prostituting itself by accepting a $100,000.00 grant from Philip Morris, the world’s largest drug lord. Smoking is now blamed for one out of every five deaths in America. Tobacco companies work aggressively to addict young children to this product both here and abroad, then sell them their drug until it kills them. I have seen giant pictures of the Marlboro man on billboards in squalid third-world villages. In South America, vans with cigarette logos distribute free samples to junior high school students and offer a light on the spot.

The Philip Morris grant serves the same public relations purposes as their sponsorship of sporting events and gifts to such charities as the United Negro College Fund. Such smoke-screens are an attempt to buy legitimacy and divert attention from their deadly drug pushing. Tobacco companies have recently concentrated their efforts on minorities, who statistically smoke at a higher rate than whites and have a far higher death rate from lung cancer. Those minority students at Davidson who accept the Philip Morris funds should know that they are being...Used big time. Sincerely, Hinton Oliver ‘77

Thanks to community for 3rd world help.

To the editors,

The Chaplain’s Office and the Chapel Committee would like to thank the Davidson College community for making our first-ever Alternative Gifts Market a tremendous success. Held as a part of the Campus-Community Christmas Party festivities on December 12, the Alternative Gifts Market raised over $6,500 for people in need in the developing world and in the USA. We extend special thanks to those groups which set up sale booths at the market: Connor House, Davidson United Methodist Church, FCA, IVCF, Inverse, PiKA, Rusk, SigEp, Warner Hall, and Westminster Fellowship.

The project which got the most support was the purchase of water buffalo for families in India; a total of $791 went toward this project. Other projects which received a great deal of support were the purchase of rain forest acreage in Brazil, fruit and fuel trees in Guatemala, and eye surgery for children in Ghana. Through your generosity, people around the world will be helped in a variety of ways in 1994. Thanks again for your great participation. And be on the lookout for the next Alternative Gifts Market when Christmas rolls around again.

Sincerely,
Rob Spach (Chaplain)

McKelway corrects Statement article.

To the editors,

Thank you for an informative article on the Statement of Purpose issue. One correction, however, needs to be made. The much-discussed first two sentences of the second paragraph of the proposed Statement do not represent “an affirmation of all religions,” nor do I believe that “acceptance of other beliefs is a natural result of Davidson’s Christian heritage” as your reporter claims. The proposed Statement says that “the loyalty of the college extends... to the whole human community and includes openness to and respect for the world's various religious traditions.” “Openness” and “respect” are quite different from “affirmation” and “acceptance.”

Because the experience of God is always specific, no particular faith could affirm “all religions,” but in so far as it is God who is known (a God captive neither to church nor creed), any authentic faith would have to be open and respectful toward others.

Sincerely,
A.J. McKelway

The following column is reprinted from the University of Texas at Dallas campus newspaper, The Mercury, October 4, 1993.

I skipped class the other day, well, missed really, but the effect was the same. It occurred to me then that if I hold UTD professors to high account, as I did in this space four weeks ago, I must hold up my end of the bargain. I think that we, as students, enter into a contract with our teachers. In the student/teacher contract, as in all contracts, we have rights and responsibilities. We may rightfully expect accurate information sensibly presented and attention to our work by knowledgeable people who answer questions and address problems related to the subject of the course. In exchange, we are expected to attend class, do the homework, and take examinations. This is the most basic level of our contract. I call it schooling. It is what we agree to when we pay our fees. Turn up the heat a little bit and we may rightly request more of our teachers. I call this learning and it is a little more personal than schooling.
