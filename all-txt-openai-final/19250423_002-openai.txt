Dukes Hit in Pinches and Win Saturday Game
Davidson Shows Superiority in Field But Unable to Hit Well—Score 9-2

The Wildcats broke out of their losing streak in the game with Duke University last Saturday, and lost to that
team 9-2. The Wildcats broke the ice by placing a run in the right column in the second inning. This
was the last scoring they did, however, until the last frame, when three successive hits by Laird, Wells, and Woodham
pushed another tally across the plate.

The game from the standpoint of fielding was by far the best played by Davidson this season, as no one
made an error and most of the throws were good. In hitting, too, the Wildcats were on par with the
victors as they garnered only one less hit than Duke was able to get, but the Dukemen happened to hit
when men were on the paths and when runs were needed. One home run by Smith and four two-baggers, one
each by Pierce, Johnson, and two by Chappell, and the wildness of the Davidson pitchers accounted for the heavy scoring
by Duke.

Three Wildcat pitchers were used by Coach Younger in a vain attempt to stop the rush of Duke runs but
none of them proved to be very effective. Laird worked the first eight innings, but was yanked and placed in
the outfield and Hampton took up the burden. He proved to be unable to stand the pace and was replaced
by Oden, who finished the game.

SPORTOGRAPHS
By Ernest Milton

The Freshman team seems to be a hard-hitting bunch. Nine men are hitting over 300 percent. Three of these, though,
do not play regularly, but it means that six of the regulars are hitting ‘em hard and far. Two of
these are pitchers, too. Poole has an average of .600, having got nine bingles out of 15 trials. Maulden, who
either pitches or plays in the outfield, is hitting .344. Dulin, Arrowood, Johnson, and Kugler are the other regulars, while
C. Cathey, McGeachy, and Wilson are in the bracket above them. By the way, the team’s average is .308. It
must be considered, too, that they have been up against some good opponents. The Raeford boys are the ones that
kept the average from being perhaps 15 points higher.

Doc DeArmon’s lads are a hitting crew, too. They almost defeated the Fresh last Friday. The schedule this week, the
trip that they are on now, will prove a true test of their mettle.

You don't often see two men tagged out at home within a second of each other. But that’s what happened
in the Lowell game. If the Freshmen can continue their record, we ought to have some good varsity material for
next year. However, when you consider that the varsity’s batting average is .247, that really is not so bad. We
just can’t hold them for some reason or other. The Wofford game started off fine, and was a splendid game
until the sixth, when the lads from Spartanburg began touching the offerings of Oden so freely that they had a
telling effect. And Duke won her first varsity victory from Davidson by a good margin in Greensboro Saturday.

This afternoon the tennis boys are playing the University of Virginia. You already know whether they defeated the University of
Maryland and Navy. We still have the Union Seminary team to face, and the Winston-Salem Country Club. This is a
big trip for the tennis team, and we are glad of it. We like to see Davidson’s teams, no matter
what branch of sport, go up against some of the bigger institutions. Meeting Navy in tennis gave us two matches
in the minor sports, to be sure, but we met them just the same. Then Georgia Tech in basketball and
golf, even though they did beat us in the latter one.

Davidson Youngsters in Peppy Finish Over Lowell
McGeachy Makes Unusual Play at Home Plate—Game Decided Only in Last Moments

“Lefty” Hawkins, of Lowell High School, tried to pitch two games in succession, defeating Charlotte High School and then coming
to pitch against the Davidson Fresh.| but the strain was too great, and he weakened in the ninth inning. After
having fanned two men he walked Dulin, hit Arrowood, walked Edgar, and then hit Edwards. He had pitched a great
game, fanning 13 of the Yearlings, who have been hitting hard this season. One of the most unusual plays ever
witnessed on Richardson field, and one which is not likely to occur again, was when Usery, of Lowell High, was
on first, having singled, and with G. Hawkins at the bat. Hawkins nailed out one to left field that looked
good for a homer, and being a fast runner he was on the heels of Usery coming in home. Edwards,
in left field, fielded the ball quickly, relayed it to Kugler, who shot it home in time for McGeachey to
tag Usery out, as well as Hawkins, who was but a few feet behind. But for this bad play on
the part of Lowell they might have had the game. As it was, they proved to be a hard-hitting outfit,
much above the average of high schools.

Within a few years, if the Davidson football team continues to improve proportionately as it has in the past year,
we will be able to handle some of the larger institutions, too.

Goodykoontz is doing his part this year. Winning three first places in two meets, and two first places and second
in another meet is a feat that deserves great commendation.

Another thing which we like is Freshman teams in all of the sports. It is a natural assumption that we
will have them in football, basketball and baseball, but just now we are thinking of the tennis team, who defeated
Charlotte Country Club last Thursday. It gives the boys a greater interest in their sports, gives them a good training,
and helps Davidson athletics in general. Next year the raqueteers are going to need some good men, and it’s up
to the Freshman class to advance some players. Davidson has had the state championship for three years now, Bradley holding
it for two years, with Harry Price copping it last year in Greensboro.
