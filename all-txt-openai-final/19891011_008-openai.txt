**Freshmen on Patterson Court: “It's so big”**

By CURT BICKERS

Although the “crunch” of scholastic endeavors has returned to freshmen, the first weekend (September 14) on Patterson Court will hardly be forgotten. Saturated with mud, sweat, and beer, a good number of freshmen’s clothes contain living proof of the activities that occurred on the Court. Freshmen were given many opportunities to indulge themselves. From barbecues to band parties, hanging out to hooking up, freshmen were dazzled, doused, beer-goggled, and numbed at Patterson Court. Freshmen learned, among other things, how hard it was to balance a cup. Patterson Court became, throughout the weekend, a “hotbed of sin and iniquity” for everyone involved.

Since freshman impressions of Patterson Court interest the readers most, many interviews were conducted to gain a clearer picture of what these impressions were. The halls selected for interviews were Fourth Cannon, First Richardson, and Second East Belk. The first question asked was, “What were your impressions of Patterson Court before your first weekend down?” The general consensus among those interviewed was that the Court was going to be a lot of fun. They thought it was going to be one huge party. One freshman guy went so far as to say, “I thought it was a mystical, haunted place.” It seemed as if excitement had been building from the first moment freshmen had heard of the Court.

The second question was a general polling question: “Do you prefer beer or punch?” The male population polled responded overwhelmingly with the first choice. The women, in direct contrast, voted for the second choice.

The third question evoked a chuckle from each of the freshmen interviewees. In response to “How messed up did you get?,” one freshman male answered, “Friday afternoon I was a little overanxious and consumed great quantities (of alcohol) before 7 p.m. Needless to say, I slept through the rest of the night's activities.” Most freshmen did make it to all of the functions but became “comfortably numb” as the weekend progressed.

When asked what the highlight of their first weekend was, several freshmen had intriguing replies. One girl said, “I loved dancing in the rain outside of KA to the Heebie Jeebies.” Dancing seemed to arouse everyone's interest as several First-Rich girls said, “We

Forty thousand children die every day from hunger-related diseases. Millions more will be undernourished, blinded, and otherwise disabled due to malnutrition and infection. Half the infants born in some developing countries will not survive past their fifth birthday. What can you do to help?

CROP is an answer. CROP is the name given to educational and fundraising events for hunger sponsored by the Church World Service. Davidson College has had a CROP chapter for several years and is presently planning its annual CROP WALK.

The CROP Walk for the hungry will be held Sunday, October 15 at 2 p.m., starting and ending at the Village Green. The six-mile course will include the town of Davidson and parts of Concord. Before the walk, entertainment will be provided at 1:30 p.m. Tie-dyed T-shirts will also be sold.

According to Anjali Sharma, co-chairman of the Davidson CROP Committee, all proceeds of the walk are used for medical, agricultural, and educational projects in developing countries. Last year Davidson raised $4,000. Sharma hopes to match that amount with the hopeful participation of approximately 400 volunteers.

The fifth question asked was, “What are your impressions of Patterson Court now?” One female gave a suspicious reply: “It was sooo big!” A general response was that freshmen were very excited about being able to join houses. An interesting response made by one girl was, “You know, it’s funny. With all of the drinking going on at the Court, there really was no pressure to drink if one did not feel like it.” Another girl said, “It is going to be hard for me not to spend all of my time down there.” The sleep deficits incurred by the freshmen interviewees turned out to be quite small, as napping by day seems to be a common practice among freshmen. One girl said about the nights, “We were all in drunken comas.” Partying until dawn definitely requires rest. In fact, First Rich and Fourth Cannon had a flickerball game Sunday. Consequently, First Rich lost with a score of 27-0. The final, dreaded question was, “How much work did you accomplish?” One freshman male jokingly said, “Not enough to self-select.” The midnight oil definitely burned the next night. There has to be a sacrifice made in order to have unending bliss for two full days and nights. Overall, one might say that freshmen received very favorable impressions of Patterson Court. Although it may not

The Stones still satisfy
BY MATT GOAD

The hype surrounding the Rolling Stones is incredible. The group has been called “the world’s greatest rock n’ roll band.” Stones fans say that “lots of bands have played rock n’ roll, but only one band is rock n’ roll.” This band sells out shows instantly whenever and wherever they play. They are also my favorite rock band of all time. Consequently, I was expecting a lot of lead singer Mick Jagger, guitarists Keith Richards and Ron Wood, bassist Bill Wyman and drummer Charlie Watts when they brought their Steel Wheels tour to Raleigh’s Carter-Finley Stadium. They performed in front of 58,500 fans last Saturday. “Start Me Up” started off the show, and for the most part, the first several songs were relatively new ones, including “Sad, Sad, Sad,” “Between a Rock and a Hard Place” and “Mixed Emotions,” all from their most recent album, Steel Wheels. Slim Whitman could have been on stage for all I could tell from where I was sitting, but with the aid of giant television screens and binoculars I could get an idea of what was going on up there. Jagger did his usual antics—prancing around the stage in tight black pants and an overcoat with tails. He also ‘played’ guitar on a few numbers early in the show. After they got through the newer songs the band turned to some older classics from the ‘67 to '69 era. As Richards nonchalantly strummed the opening chords of “Honky Tonk Women,” two giant inflatable women of the type mentioned in the song’s title were blown up on either side of the stage, and the crowd went wild, clearly showing that they had come to hear such oldies. Other classics followed, including “You Can’t
