Review Tom. bi

The Davidsonian salutes John Brice this week for his long and excellent record at the college. He has been employed
by Davidson for twenty-one years. Starting his work here as a janitor in Georgia Dormitory, he has served as janitor
in East, Watts, and Chambers. During his nine years of work in Georgia, John did not miss a single day.
For the past eleven years, Brice has worked in Chambers as mailman and supervisor of the mimeograph.

Brice is perhaps the most informed on what is going on on the campus, knowing most of the students by
name and activities. There are few things that happen in the town of Davidson which are missed by his keen
perception and not given full benefit of his bright outlook on life. He knows all the routines and schedules of
the various professors and soon learns the students' given writ or routine.

It is Brice who opens Chambers in the early hours of the morning, and he also who is the last
to lock the main door at night. He believes in devoting his life to his work and never doing a
job halfway.

When asked who were some of the students he remembered and why he remembered them, John replies, “I remember Sam
Spencer because he was always hard to get out of bed during the cold winter mornings. I also remember C.
Shaw Smith because he was a good magician and he was always showing me some new ‘tricks’ or I was
helping him with his pigeons.”

Brice is a strong supporter of Davidson's football teams. Some years ago at the big football games one was likely
to see John marching in front of the Davidson Band with a mop and pail yelling his “let's mop ‘em
up, Davidson!”

**Duke Law School Offers Scholarships**

The Duke University Law School is offering five Regional Scholarships worth a maximum of $3,000 each to outstanding students in
North and South Carolina, Dean J. A. McClain announced here today. Underway for the second year, the scholarship program will
provide five $1,000 awards for study in the Duke Law School during the 1956-57 academic year. Each award will be
renewable for the two succeeding years of law study provided the holder maintains a high scholastic average and demonstrates increasing
professional promise.

The scholarships will be awarded on the basis of intellectual ability, character, and potentiality for leadership in the legal profession,
Dean McClain said. Residents of North and South Carolina who will hold bachelors’ degrees from recognized colleges by September, 1956,
and who attain general scholastic averages of “B” or higher are eligible to compete. Deadline for applying is March 1,
1956. Each applicant must take the Law School Admission Test, administered by the Educational Testing Service, Princeton, N. J. It
will be given at the University of North Carolina and the University of South Carolina on November 12, 1955, and
February 18, 1956. The February test will also be given at Duke. Applications for taking this test should be made
at least 10 days in advance. Information concerning the Law School Scholarships may be obtained by writing to the Office
of the Dean, Duke University Law School, Durham, N. C.

**A JANITOR BY JOHN TRASK, JR.**

The debate activities at Davidson are conducted by the Forensic Council. The Forensic Council is a student body organization whose
purpose is to develop the oratorical and analytical abilities of its members. The Forensic program also offers opportunities to participate
in oratory, dramatic readings, and extemporaneous speaking. The main emphasis, however, is on debate. In former years, the debaters developed
their talents through an intramural program here on the campus. In more recent years, however, the debate program has extended
to inter-collegiate tournaments. The present program deals primarily with debates with other colleges. It has become almost a tradition for
the debate team to journey to Atlanta for the Agnes Scott tournament. Not only do the debaters participate in the
dozen or so “extra rounds,” but they also act as good-will ambassadors in the “extra-curricular” sense.

Other usual debate trips in the itinerary include the Tulane University Tournament in New Orleans, the Grand National Tournament at
Mary Washington College in Fredericksburg, Virginia, and a swing through some of the Ivy League schools in the East.

The subject of the debate is the same for all colleges. A national committee chooses the subject. Last year the
topic was: “Resolved: That the United States Should Offer Diplomatic Recognition to Communist China.” This subject was hotly debated across
the campus of major colleges: In fact, it was so controversial, that the teams from West Point and Annapolis were
not allowed to debate it. This year, the topic for discussion is of a more domestic nature. The various teams
across the country will, this year, debate: “Resolved: That the Non-Agricultural Industries of the United States Should Guarantee their Employees
an Annual Wage.”

This subject on the Guaranteed Annual Wage should prove quite provocative, as it has been much discussed in recent months,
particularly since the major automobile industries have accepted this radical change in their labor policy. It will not be difficult
to find speakers for either side.

The Forensic Council is open to any student who has an interest in debate. Within the next few weeks, tryouts
will be held here on the campus. Anyone who is interested should familiarize himself with the debate material which is
on reserve in the library. A notice to the time of the tryout, and the details of the requirements will
be announced at a later date. The size of the Forensic Council is somewhat limited in size because of the
desirability of working with a small group. Professor Raymond Tyson is our debate coach. Besides guiding the debate team, Professor
Tyson also directs the plays here at Davidson, as well as heads the Speech Department. The debate manager, John Trask,
makes arrangements for the trips, as well as participates in the debates. Other members of the Council include David Wood,
Ed Campbell, Tom Warlick, France Jordan, Mac Crouse, Bill Bondurant, and Graham McKinnon. Also connected with the Forensic Council is
the Tau Kappa Alpha honorary fraternity which selects its members from the members of the Forensic Council. While the Forensic
Council is open to anyone who participates in the debate program, membership in TKA is based on two years of
participation in debate here at Davidson. Anyone who is interested in the Forensic Council is asked to contact Professor Tyson,
or some member of the Forensic Council.

**NOTICE!**

There will be an organization meeting of the Forensic Council on Friday, November 11, at 3:30 p.m. in Prof. Tyson's
office. All who are planning to go out for debate this year are requested to attend.

**Dr. Edward L. R. Elson Will Speak at Vespers**

Dr. Edward L. R. Elson, pastor of the National Presbyterian Church in Washington, D. C., will deliver the Vespers message
on November 6. Dr. Elson is pastor of the church of which President Eisenhower is a member. Readers are referred
to the current issue of Colliers for a feature article on Dr. Elson and his ministry.

Dr. Elson was born in Monongahela, Pennsylvania, and received his B.A. degree from Asbury College. He also holds degrees of
Master of Theology from the University of Southern California, Doctor of Divinity from Wheaton and Occidental, and Doctor of Letters
from Centre College. Ordained in 1930 at Santa Monica, California, he began his ministry at First Church there. He served
at the First Presbyterian Church at La Jolla, San Diego, before he came to the National Presbyterian Church in 1946.
Dr. Elson was commissioned a chaplain in the U. S. Army Reserve and rose to the rank of colonel. On
active duty he was with the XXI Corps, which was under General Eisenhower's command.

**Chamber Music Guild To Present First Davidson Concert**

The Intercollege Chamber Music Guild will offer its first Davidson College concert of the season on Friday evening, November 11.
Works to be heard in this concert include Haydn's “String Quartet, Op. 71, No. 1”; Vivaldi’s “Concerto for two violins”;
a solo cantata by Bach, for baritone soloist with strings and oboe; and the “Mother Goose Suite” for two pianos
by Ravel.

Members of this year's Intercollege Quartet are Melvin Sipe of Queens College, violin; William Tritt of Catawba College, violin; Betty
Gehring of Davidson College, viola; and Oliver Godla, of Charlotte, violoncello. Soloists in the Vivaldi “Concerto” will be Betty Gehring
and Doris West, both of Davidson. Thomas Holt, a baritone recently appointed to the faculty of Catawba College, will be
soloist in the Bach cantata, and will be accompanied by the quartet of strings and Frank West, oboist, new member
of the Davidson College music faculty. The Ravel “Suite” will be played by Philip Gehring and John Satterfield, both of
the Davidson faculty.

The concert will begin at 8:15 p.m. in the Ballroom of the David Ovens College Union on the Davidson College
campus. Admission is free. The Intercollege Chamber Music Guild is entering its fourth year with this concert. Its purpose is
to make available to the Queens, Davidson and Catawba College communities the ensemble music of great composers, performed in informal
surroundings by the combined talent of the three colleges.

**LIBERAL ARTS SCHOOLS APPEAL TO ALUMNI FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE**

No student or his family ever pays the full cost of his college education. If he attends a State university,
for example, the taxpayers of the State foot a good part of the bill. If he attends an independent, privately
supported liberal arts college or a university, its friends past and present pay a good part of his expenses, by
way of accumulated gifts for capital.

**FREE CUTS DEPEND UPON WILDCATS WINNING NEXT TWO**

The faculty has announced that the Davidson student body will be granted free class cuts on Saturday, November 19 provided
that the Davidson Wildcats win both the Richmond game tomorrow, and the Wofford game next Saturday. If the team wins,
the schedule of classes will be altered with the following changes: the normal Saturday classes will...

Eumanean Literary Society held...

**Birch Presents Show to Packed Chambers Crowd**

BY BOB LATHAN

A spellbound crowd was on hand Wednesday night when McDonald Birch, Master Magician or “Junior Houdini,” presented his spectacular show
of magic tricks, mysteries, and illusions in Chambers auditorium.be held on Friday in place of the normal Friday morning classes.
However, if a student has a Friday afternoon class, he will be required to go to the regular Friday afternoon
class. The reason for the elimination of the Friday classes is that the Saturday classes were lost during the Homecoming
holiday.

Birch's attractive personality and ready wit added levity to the amazing performance. To open the show, Birch was presented as
the fifth in a series of great magicians. Those other than Birch included Hermann, Kellar, Houdini, and Thurston. Birch then
proceeded to open up his ever-widening bag of tricks. Highlights of the evening were Birch’s slicing of a beautiful girl
into quarters, causing a live Shetland pony to disappear in mid-air, and escaping from a nailed-in wooden box. The Hoke
Lumber Company made the box and issued the challenge to Birch to escape from it.

From the audience's standpoint, however, it was a young lad named James who stole the show. Quite a comedian himself,
James was the first member of the audience to be awarded an honorary membership in the Junior Guild of Helpers
for Birch (serial No. 19403). Many deserving individuals were later conferred this high honor, however. These included Allen Hall, Angus
McBryde, and Ed Flato (who nailed Birch into his wooden box); a little girl named Mimie; a boy who called
himself John McGavock; a young lad named Carl Sherrill; the person in the audience who started the clapping on one
occasion; Sam Smith (although he barely missed out nailing Birch in his “casket” since only three were needed); and possibly
some other Davidson youngsters.

Always ready with an answer, when asked what his name was, Birch quipped, “You'd better not let Shaw Smith hear
that after all his advertising.” When asked how to tell if a guinea pig used in a trick was a
boy or a girl, he replied, “That one has a mustache.” Other common expressions used by Birch were his magic
word “Brrrrrrtose,” and the statement, “This is not funny,” when he drew laughs.

Miss Mabel Sperry’s xylophone solos opened the second half of the show. Her selections ranged from “Hungarian Dance No. 5”
to “Lady of Spain.” Miss Sperry is a brilliant young musical star and Birch’s chief assistant. She was the beautiful
girl already referred to whom Birch supposedly sliced into quarters with “the world’s smallest meat cleaver,” as he called his
giant butcher's instrument. After Miss Sperry was given some yellow roses by the Union, Birch fittingly changed them into American
beauties (roses, that is).

During the latter part of the show “Mysterio,” an ancient Egyptian idol, performed. It counted numbers with a hammer and
selected colors as Birch named them. To make the trick “harder,” Birch blindfolded “Mysterio” for the final color selection. The
show ended with the presentation of a brilliant spectacle known as “The Mirage,” in which Birch pulled beautifully-colored silk handkerchiefs
from an apparently empty basket.

Birch introduced the famous hypnotist, Preston, who was in the audience witnessing the show along with C. Shaw Smith, the
foremost magician of the Davidson College Student Union. All who saw the show agreed that Birch merited his greatness and
that “a show with style and class written all over it” would be a fitting appraisal of it.

The Society initiated eight men as the result of the fall bidding. They are Messrs. Charles Nanney, Leonard Thomas, Nelson
Grice, John Gordon, Gluyas Craven, Jim Zeh, Harrison Wayner, and Glenn Robertson. The initiation ceremony was written by Mr. Fred
Myers in 1954. The program for the evening consisted of original papers by three sophomore members. Mr. Willard Wolfe read
his sensitive short story, Red Fruit on the Dark Ground; Mr. Bob Sloan presented a parody on Chaucer, “Captering to
Canterbury,” and Mr. John Bernhardt read an informal essay on contemporary Germany. The critics for the evening were Mr. Jim
Batten and Mr. Don Carmichael. Both of the critics were impressed with the authenticity of Mr. Wolfe’s short story and
Mr. Bernhardt's essay. After the critics’ reports, the Program Chairman concluded the evening’s entertainment by calling upon Mr. Jim Marshall
and Mr. Andy Hamilton for impromptu speeches.

Eumanean Society will hold its third meeting of the semester on Monday night, November 7. The program will consist of
a group participation debate and a paper by one of the noted members of the Society.

Perhaps the real difference in the outcome of the game was to be found in the line play. Outstanding in
a fine effort were Bill Price, Tom Owen, Dave Fagg, and Harold Davis. When he was relieved from his pass
receiving duties, Tom Newton threw several vicious blocks. Don Campbell and Ken Conger were particularly effective on running plays. A
big tough outfit, Stetson left its mark on several players, and several banged-up limbs will have to be treated with
care this week. However, the Cats should be at near top strength for the Richmond game.

Pharr, a recent recipient of D.M.S. orders, is also a member of Scabbard and Blade. Sigma Pi Sigma, the Honorary
Physics Fraternity elected him president last Spring and in turn he was also elected president of the Honorary Fraternity Council.
Joe Billy is also president of his social fraternity, Pi Kappa Alpha.

HARLEY SMITH
Davidson's football fortunes have been closely linked with Harley Smith for upwards of four years. Last year the sparkplug of
the Davidson backfield was elected co-captain by his teammates for the ensuing year. Smith, a Phi Delt from DeFuniac Springs,
Florida, is a pre-med major. An active member of Scabbard and Blade, Smith serves as a cadet officer in the
Davidson Regiment.

membership during the annual fall ODK tapping program.

Davidsonian Fine Arts Critic

These facts, long known to presidents and boards of trustees responsible for the conduct of colleges and universities, are underscored
by the results of a survey conducted during 1954 by the Council for Financial Aid to Education, an objective, non-profit,
advisory group founded by leading businessmen. In analyzing all data from the survey, including operating costs and student fees, the
Council divided the 753 responding colleges and universities into nine logical categories. During the five-year period 1948-49 to 1953-54, institutions
in all nine of these groups increased their average charges for student tuition and fees. Among 184 non-denominational, independent, liberal
arts colleges the average rise was 24 percent, from $441 to $549. On the other hand, between 1947-48 and 1952-53
the average cost, among this group, of operations per full-time student rose by 46 percent, from $726 to $1,060. The
cost per student to the institution, above his payments, rose by an even steeper 98 percent, from $201 to $397.

Privately supported colleges and universities therefore attach increasing importance to the Annual Giving by alumni. This is a means of
supplying a person’s alma mater with badly needed funds for current operations. It is also a means of repaying what
the supporters of the institution have made available to the graduate. Gifts to the Alumni Fund are a form of
repayment of a loan by society. Support of this kind is urgently needed by all colleges and universities, both independent
and tax-supported. It is a means of ensuring that the institutions will be able to render as good service to
future generations as they render to the present. One of the first tests of a good alumnus is his recognition
of an opportunity to help the college that helped him, and also to make certain it will be able to
serve future generations of students as well as it served him.

Danforth Foundation Announces Awards
The Danforth Foundation is planning to award again this year fifty fellowships to graduating seniors who plan to do graduate
study in preparation for college teaching. Selections are made on the basis of outstanding academic ability, personality congenial to the
classroom, and integrity and character, including faith and commitment in the Christian tradition. The Danforth Foundation offers financial assistance to
its Fellows according to individual need. Among recent Davidson winners of the Danforth Fellowships have been Henry Brockman ‘55, Ed
Stuart, ‘54, and Allen Garrison ‘63. Seniors interested in the Danforth Fellowships should consult with Professor George L. Abernethy.

Grad. Record Exams To Be Given At D.C.
Dr. George L. Abernethy has announced that the Graduate Record Examinations will be given at Davidson College on January 21,
1956 and April 28, 1956. Seniors who are planning to do graduate study are urged to find out whether the
Graduate Record Examination is required for admission to the graduate schools of their choice. Students interested in taking the Graduate
Record Examination should write at once for application blanks to the Educational Testing Service, 20 Nassau Street, Princeton, New Jersey.

Young Republicans Discuss Expansion
The Young Republicans Club met Tuesday night in the Green Room of the college Union. Tom Hall presided and Watt
McCain was elected the new vice president. It was announced at the meeting that Congressman Charles R. Jonas had been
engaged by the Chapel Committee to speak here on November 17. It was believed possible that Mr. Jonas might be
on the campus for some time preceding or following chapel, and many are looking forward to meeting and talking with
him. Plans were discussed for starting Young Republicans Clubs on other campuses and increasing the size and effectiveness of the
local chapter. All interested persons are cordially invited to attend the meetings every other Tuesday night. A movie on the
participation of young Americans, the “amateurs,” in the everyday business of politics was shown, and refreshments were served.
