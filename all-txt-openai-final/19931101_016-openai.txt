Serebrennikov lectures about images of women in art and ads

By Kristin Garris

Before phone directories were even printed this year, the Committee for Women's Issues had planned a lecture to discuss pictorial
images of women. Art History professor Nina Serebrennikov led a discussion of “Images of Women in Art and Advertising” on
Tuesday, October 26. The event, held in the lecture hall of the new Visual Arts center and sponsored by the
Committee for Women’s Issues, attracted 43 students and one professor.

Dr. Serebrennikov began the discussion by juxtaposing an image of a woman photographed by Walker Evans in the 1930s with
an image of model Kate Moss in a well-known Calvin Klein advertisement. She spoke of the underlying messages relayed by
the images, of what these images say about women, and of the control employed by artists in the ways they
choose to convey images of women.

In describing the ways in which women have been portrayed, predominantly by male artists, throughout the history of art, Dr.
Serebrennikov used images of paintings by Raphael, Titian, Caravaggio, Fragonard, Courbet, Renoir, Picasso, de Kooning, and others. She contrasted two
portrayals of the same Biblical scene of Judith and Holofernes; one was painted by the male artist Caravaggio and one
was painted by the female artist Artemisia Gentileschi. The female artist deliberately portrayed a strong female figure, while the male
artist portrayed a seemingly timid and weaker female figure.

Advertisements for products such as men’s cologne, handbags, hair color treatments, and clothing were discussed concerning their portrayals of women
and the messages conveyed to both male and female viewers. Finally, Serebrennikov compared examples of the pop art of Roy
Lichtenstein with the image found on the front of the 1993-94 Davidson telephone directory. Some in the Davidson community have
found the image offensive to females at Davidson; some feel it is inappropriate, but not offensive. Others do not see
any problem with the picture.

A few students noted that they were neither aware of the style of Lichtenstein’s pop art nor of the reference
to Dr. Sam Spencer, who was president of Davidson College in 1973 when the college first admitted full-time female students.
Some students who were both aware of the pop art style and the meaning of “Sam” still found the directory
image offensive because they believe it does not present an acceptable image of women at Davidson and does not connote
respect for the celebration of twenty years of women at Davidson.

Editor's note: The directory issue is discussed in opinions.
