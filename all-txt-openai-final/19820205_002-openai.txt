I certainly was surprised to see what Paul Q. Lazarro/ATO said about Thurston Hatcher’s mother. How does Paul/ATO know that Thurston’s mom works in the kitchen at home? She may not! At my house, my mother does not wash the dishes. My father washes them, and when I’m home, I help. How unfortunate that Paul/ATO, who I assume prides himself/itself on being non-conformist, should fall into the use of such stereotypical delineations. I had such faith in you. Another thing: I thought ATO stood up for individualism. If you do, then why didn’t you sign your letter with a real name? Are you afraid to accept the consequences of your own statements? Furthermore, I have reason to believe that one letter signed “ATO” may not reflect the ideas of the entire ATO organization. Let individuals speak for themselves, and you speak for yourself. Thurston Hatcher had the nerve to sign his real name, and so sign mine,

Elizabeth Brazell told you last week that she broke her elbow at 8:15 on a Saturday morning as a result of physical plant neglect. I think the accusation was unfair, and you ought to agree, unless you think it is a reasonable policy to call in grounds crew members at some ungodly a.m. hour on their day off. The steps in question had been cleared of snowfall several days before and didn’t look ice-covered; rain had coated them that night. The “physical plant” did call in grounds workers to clear the ice, but had the consideration not to call them before 8:15. These details may seem somewhat pedantic, but they are relevant, and Elizabeth seemed to understand the situation of her fall. Nebulous scapegoats are fun to ride, though, and she proceeded with her letter. What really angers me, though, is that she refused to publicly soften her accusation even after I had explained the situation more fully, obligating me to take a hunk out of a busy evening to correct her for you. None of this has any bearing on the argument Elizabeth was supposedly writing to second, that the college should have the ice cleared off all the walks; steps, which are more dangerous, are generally cleared as soon as possible. I felt sorry for people on crutches, too, and I think the proposal ought to be considered. Even if the money and time needed could be made available, however, implementation would not be easy; once the steps are cleared, the walks are likely to be solidly trampled and refrozen. A tractor-snowplow, with my weight on the blade, was unable to penetrate the ice on a walk near Chambers. Gripe, but take some trouble to understand who and what you are attacking. Specific, well-considered suggestions are more useful in this type of situation, though, and, if they are not listened to, you have cause to gripe.

Upon this lush campus with its monuments constructed to praise and encourage our ability to devour—food, drink, books, each other—has this become all we can even imagine doing? There exists today only a mere scar to remind us of how we once carelessly whiled away the time; how we played! How we played at leaving our studies and our analytical minds behind—in a time before the...Video invasion! How we played at romance on moonlit evenings to the singing of the stars without the Band Party Blare! Where have the simple — pant I lament that those who transfer into or visit Davidson, this year’s freshmen and maybe the next will not be able to enjoy the swing that previously hung outside Richardson dorm and that many of the rest do not miss such simple play!

Over the past months, the College Union has sustained serious damage, apparently due to alcohol abuse. The Union Board is not only concerned that there was damage to the building but also that no student has volunteered any information about the cause of the damages. In order to increase student awareness of the seriousness of this vandalism, which is a violation of the Code of Responsibility, the Union Board has decided that from this Wednesday through Saturday the 900 Room will remain open, but no alcohol will be served. We do not intend this as a punishment but as a reminder of students’ responsibility. Members of the Union Board will be available during Coffee and Cokes this Thursday to discuss the issue and will be in the 900 Room every night from Wednesday through Saturday.

In last week’s article regarding the proposal for a new all-women’s eating house, I was quoted as saying that “no one” in Rusk House was happy. I’m afraid my comments were misunderstood. It is true that Rusk House is a diverse group of people (can you imagine any group of 85 that wouldn’t be diverse?) but this is something we take pride in since a great number of Davidson coeds have interest in and enjoy Rusk. I would also agree that in a group of 85 there will always be some who are not always happy with all the activities that are geared toward pleasing the majority. However, I would not go so far as to say that “no one” is happy. If this was the case, I don’t think we’d have over 45 people waiting to join Rusk. Furthermore, I did not say that “the only way to please everyone is to separate the girls into two eating houses, instead of simply placing the girls on the waiting list into the new house.” What I did say, which was apparently misconstrued, was that I was aware that some Rusk members would probably leave Rusk to join the new house since there would now be a choice between two all-female houses, but that this did not threaten the stability of our house due to the number of waiting list members who would prefer to fill the empty spaces at Rusk instead of eating with the new house. My first inclination was to let this matter go unmentioned, but because of encouragement from other students and faculty who seem quite discontented with the frequent distortions printed in The Davidsonian, along with cries from Rusk members of “we aren’t unhappy,” I felt compelled to offer your readers these statements—straight from the horse’s mouth—in hopes of a more accurate statement of my position.

Shannon Walters
President, Rusk House

(Ed. note: I have checked Peter Gulyn’s notes for this article and found that the story corresponds to them. Ms. Walters’ comments may not, however, reflect every Rusk member’s opinion.)
