**An Intimate Evening with the Carolina Chamber Symphony**

By Liz Lockett

Directed by 26-year-old Robert Franz, the small and intimate Carolina Chamber Symphony delighted the audience Monday night in Hodson Hall
with an array of music. Earlier that afternoon, the director, flutist, and composer of the chamber group held an informal
gathering to share their musical backgrounds and experiences with Davidson students.

Franz assembled the ensemble approximately three years ago. More recently, Lawrence Dillon composed a flute concerto specifically for the extremely
talented flutist Elizabeth Holler. This new and exciting piece was featured during the second half of the performance.

First, the chamber group played Symphony No. 71 in B-flat Major by Haydn. This classical piece was rather light in
texture and style. The group phrased and dynamically controlled the piece well to create an appropriate continuity of energy and
sound.

On a different note, the second piece performed was Tchaikovsky’s Serenade for Strings, Op. 48 in C Major. Since the
orchestral group is comprised primarily of strings, this piece was an excellent choice to perform. The unpredictable and deeply romantic
serenade revealed another side of Tchaikovsky’s musical capability to the audience. As a sharp contrast to the Haydn piece, it
exposed the group’s ability to perform the rich, emotionally deep quality of sound characteristic of the Romantic era.

After a brief intermission, Dillon’s Concerto for Flute and Chamber Orchestra was heard by a new and eager audience. Dillon
utilized extended flute techniques, such as over-blowing and flutter-tonguing, to create a distinctive, twentieth-century sound. The piece is based upon
a simple, three-note motif. By altering the character of the flute, this motif expands for 25 minutes through three movements.
The last movement consists of a combination of two polar flute characters to create a tense yet vivacious ending to
a wonderful performance.

With such an atypical program, the performers and Franz displayed immense skill, depth, and diversity. This relatively new and young
chamber ensemble is sure to continue in their success.

**BYOB: Brew Your Own Beer**

By Katharine Laidlaw

Hard to believe, but lately, there’s been more than just coffee brewing at Davidson. As part of the Union-sponsored “Cheers,”
Davidson students and faculty are able to reap the experience of seasoned beer-brewer David Borax and learn just how easy
it is to whip up a case at home.

Borax, an editor for the Charlotte Observer’s “Local” section, began home-brewing two years ago in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He believes that
the advantages to home-brewing begin with saving money, but ultimately he enjoys being able to control how his beer will
taste. Freshness, for example, is a key consideration when it comes to premium beer. There’s no way of knowing just
how long that six-pack has sat on the shelf of the mini-mart.

Most national brands add preservatives and pasteurize their beers, all of which can have dire effects on its flavor. At
home, the beer-brewer is in control of all facets of his beer’s color, taste, and age. Borax recommends that the
first step to begin home-brewing is to buy "The New Complete Joy of Home-Brewing" by Charlie Papazian, a guide which
Borax confirms is the bible of this craft. The materials can be purchased at specific beer-brewing stores, such as Alternative
Beverage in Charlotte, or even through catalogs.

All together, the actual supplies and the ingredients needed to brew your first batch cost about ninety dollars, but once
you’ve invested in the hardware, you’ll be making two cases of premium beer for the price of two dollars a
six-pack. North Carolina law prohibits selling beer which you have brewed at home, but how close you stick to the
recipe is your own business. Variations in the ingredients can change the alcohol content, color, or texture of your beer,
but to brew successfully, Borax stresses the importance of cleanliness.

He is meticulous about washing his materials both before and after using them, using purified spring water, and making sure
his beer is not exposed to air. After all, unwelcome bacteria is a twist on the recipe for which your
beer just might not forgive you.

If you’re ready to take the plunge, call Alternative Beverage in Charlotte and ask when their next free demonstration will
take place. Or if you’re more impressed with the idea of “home-brewed” beer rather than actually having to stew it
up yourself, visit the Dilworth Brewery, where they feature different types of home-brewed beer each week. Who knows — you
may never...drink Budweiser again.

When I first heard that senior Cat Grimmell’s play had advanced in the American College Theatre Festival’s playwriting competition, I
was anxious to talk to her. Directed by senior Scott Lenhart, the cast of The First Time includes Davidson students
Christine Hietzenroder, Amber Sharick, Heather Baldwin, Caroline Ritchie, Amanda Bryan, Jennifer Tracy, Renu Bhatt, and Eleanor Hatcher. The play will
be performed at the Taylor Auditorium in Greensboro on February 2, where it will be judged against four other plays
based on its viability as a production. If the play continues to advance, it could end up as a professional
production at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. Needless to say, I was very pleased to get a chance to
talk with both Cat and Scott about the play.

Could you tell me a little about the plot?
Cat: It’s about SEX, that’s what it’s about!
Scott: [laughing] You don’t have to put that in there...
Cat: It’s about eight women who have been pretty much good friends throughout their college career, and one of them
just had her first-time sexual experience. They all know about it and decide they’re going to have a party for
her, kind of a rite-of-passage—more like a guy’s first time, like ‘way to go, you did it baby, you joined
the club.’ So they plan all this stuff, and it’s kind of a story about how that’s positive and negative
and how some things go wrong. All the women start telling about their first-time sexual experiences, and it’s a mixed
bag. There’s one girl who gets gang raped, and one girl who regrets her experiences; and it moves through like
that. It’s about eight women who are kind of like women you’d meet at Davidson—different personalities obviously, but the same
upbringing.

You mentioned that the musician Tori Amos influenced your play. How?
Cat: I was listening to Tori Amos’s first album, and that’s kind of how I got the images and the
ideas for the play in my head. The song “Silent All These Years” really struck me. There’s a perception that
women don’t talk about sex, and we really do. People talk about sex. But a lot of times the painful
aspects of sex aren’t talked about. It’s not meant to be a play that’s down on men, but there are
mixed reactions to men. It’s about how sex can be dividing and bonding at the same time.

Having a male director is kind of an interesting choice.
Scott: Yeah, it is very interesting. Every day I learn something, and I’m like, ‘Does this really happen?’ But it’s
very exciting, and I’m learning a lot about writing, about directing, and about relationships. I’ve never worked with this many
people before, but everyone’s very energetic and very giving, so there really isn’t a problem. I’m learning a lot, as
Cat is, just about the process. We’re all contributing, and things are changing as we move from day to day.
Cat: It is so collaborative, it feels kind of like a family right now. I think the hardest part is
feeling like, no matter where we get with it, come February 2, it goes on. Like it or hate it,
I’m sitting in that audience. I feel really lucky, especially as a beginning writer, to be working with Scott and
all the actors. I’m very scared about having it done, but I have a lot of faith in them. I
just need to have faith in myself.

Movie Review
Tiska picks Blockbuster’s best
By Tammy Tiska

Breathe a sigh of relief—no angst-laden movie review this week. I’m taking my cue from Rachel and offering my own
list of favorite movies. The only problem I had with Rachel’s choices was Sheltering Sky, the entirety of which went
over my head. Here are some pretty mainstream movies that you may have overlooked while wandering the aisles at Blockbuster.
My apologies to all the anti-Hollywood knee-jerk film liberals who only watch foreign or black-and-white films. That’s a list for
another day.

3. Thelma & Louise. I know, it’s a staple in the diet of Generation X feminists, but don’t let that
scare you away. This drama about waking up to life on a Western highway has something for everyone, including many
moments of comic brilliance. One of the most disturbing and controversial endings in recent movie history is reason enough to
see this film. And for all those new jump-on-the-bandwagon Brad Pitt converts, this is where he got his start. This
is also the only video I own.

2. What’s Eating Gilbert Grape. If you heard of this film, it is probably due to Leonardo DiCaprio’s amazing performance
as a mentally...
