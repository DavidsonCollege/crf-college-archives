A BOY WITH A GREAT DREAM

O Jesus, once a Nazareth boy
And tempted like as we,
All inward foes help us destroy
And spotless all to be.
We trust Thee, for the grace to win
The high victorious goal,
Where purity shall conquer sin
In Christ-like self-control.

The 13th of June, 1948 - through a cloudless sky the sun caused dawn on two fields separated by distance and but united in the spirit of that American tradition, the ALL-Star game. The American League was taking the measurements of their arch-rivals, the Davidson All-Stars. With a promising first inning, they were giving the West team a walloping.

The All-Stars, led by the jet-propelled pitching of John Rose, got off to a big lead in the first inning with a total of eight runs. With this comfortable lead, Rose settled down to a fine game of pitching. However, this margin began to look quite small due to the ability of Blushen to hold them to only one more run, which came in the second inning.

The game was a pitcher's duel from the first till the seventh inning, when Bill Robertson leveled off a pitch that resulted in a home run. Had it occurred at any other time, it probably would have changed the story. At this point, Cameron relieved Rose and took the helm from there on.

The game continued in this fashion, ending in the ninth when Ashmore's attempted bunt was automatically hit when the ball tipped off the bat to hit him. He was followed by Jim who connected for a long fly out to second.

It looked like extra innings were in line when "Riceps" Jackson, the plucky little catcher for West, appeared at the plate. Cameron, undaunted by his adversary, proceeded to slip three called strikes past him - the out, the game, and the day.
