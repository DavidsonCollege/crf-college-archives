By LARRY DAGENHART, JR.

The major-leaguers don’t start the regular season until April, but college baseball is in full swing. Tuesday afternoon, the baseball
Wildcats improved their record to 14-9 with a 10-7 win over Wake Forest. The win was Davidson’s second over an
ACC team this year (Davidson beat N.C. State on March 3).

Roy Dante Vilardi went four for five with one homer, a double, and three RBIs. Vilardi is currently batting .351
and is fourth on the Wildcats’ batting average list. Top sluggers for Davidson include Chris Stuart (.418), Peter Hughes (.407),
and Mike Holland (.364).

In the pitching department, the Cats are led by sophomore Greg Wilcox, who posts a 5-1 record and a 3.12
earned run average. Freshman Brad Wazenberg is also showing strength as an ace reliever with ten game appearances and four
saves. Also, Charley Winborne and Jeff Loser have gotten some quality pitching time and post 3-3 and 2-2 records, respectively.
First-year coach Jim Stoeckel is very pleased with the team’s performance so far.

**Track team builds momentum after successful weekend**

By BILL SMITH

Coach Gary Andrew was pleased with the overall performance of his track teams in this past weekend’s multi-team track meet.
He also mentioned that this meet and the hard practices of late will lay the foundations for “a weekend of
good performances” this at the Emory Invitational, provided the weather is not a hindrance. Furthermore, Emory has a quality track
and with the competition, there should be some excellent races and events.

In the men’s division, Davidson outdistanced J.C. Smith by two points, fifty-eight to fifty-six, to capture first overall. Winston-Salem State
and Eastern Mennonite followed, at nineteen and eighteen points respectively, and never challenged the leaders. In Coach Andrew’s first track
victory since his arrival, strong performances in the distance races and a few field events provided the close win.

John Lantis placed second in the 800-meter run with a 2:01.6 and, says Coach Andrew, “is running well [in this
event]”. Just behind Lantis in third place was Larry Ray with a time of 2:04.46. Another distance runner, Jay Clugston,
performed well in two events, the 1500-meter and 5000-meter runs, taking second (4:15) and first (16:17) respectively. Running close to
Clugston in the 1500 was David Maynard who finished third with a 4:20 time. And in the 5000, Steve Childs
and Chris Fisher placed second and third with times of 16:25 and 16:31. Bob Cornish, a co-captain with Lantis, ran
the steeplechase in 10:44 to place first.

For the field events, Jeff Williamson and Doug Saintsing are Coach Andrew’s strongest competitors. Williamson took first in the discus
with a throw of 111 feet, 10 inches; Saintsing won the javelin event with a toss of 143 feet, 9
inches. The two also competed in the shot put where they took second and third--Williamson put for 39 feet, 2
1/2 inches and Saintsing put for 35 feet, 3 1/4 inches. Also placing in field events were Clay Wright and
Andy Tysz. Wright vaulted ten feet in the pole vault to capture first place. Tysz scored first in the triple
jump with a jump of 37 feet, 5 inches; he scored second in the long jump with a jump of
18 feet, 10 inches. Also, the team of Lantis, Ray, David Petranick, and Maynard picked up second place in the
mile relay with a time of 3:37.3.

The women’s team picked up four wins and one loss in their dual meet battle with Eastern Mennonite, High Point,
J.C. Smith, Western Carolina, and Winston-Salem State. The loss came against Western Carolina. The point leaders for the team this
year according to Coach Andrew are sophomores Missy Willis and Kathy MacDonald and freshman Katie Reynolds. MacDonald, who set the
school record in high jump three weekends ago with a jump of five feet, finished second in the high jump
clearing 4 feet, 8 1/4 inches. Finishing second in the 100-meter hurdles was Missy Meegan with a time of :19.37.
Reynolds placed second in her event, the 5000-meter, with a time of 20:31.53. Willis, the top performer on the team,
captured two events, the 800-meter and the 1500-meter. Her times in winning those two events were 2:29.5 in the 800
and 5:02.78 in the 1500. Also competing in a distance event was Laurie Reams, who finished second in the 3000-meter
with a time of 11:50.29. Davidson’s mile relay team of Willis, Reynolds, Chelley Alexander, and Karen Kemerait took second place
with their time.Time of 4:38.69. Pleased with the team’s performance so far this year and commented that their performances have
exceeded his preseason expectations. “With twelve pitchers we have a lot of balance, and with 59 scheduled games, we need
a lot of people. Our goal this year is to do well in the conference and develop more people who
can play.” After dropping two of three games to the Citadel last weekend, Davidson is 1-2 in the Southern Conference
and has another important series at home with Furman this weekend. The doubleheader Saturday begins at 12:00 noon and the
game Sunday is at 1:00 p.m.

The Davidson women’s tennis team raised its record to 9-6 with three victories last week. The Lady Cats defeated the
University of Kalamazoo, East Tennessee State, and Appalachian State. The victories over ETSU and ASU raised the team’s conference record
to 2-0. Last Sunday, the Lady Cats traveled to Durham to play Kalamazoo. The match proved to be fairly easy,
as Davidson won 8-1. Amy McNelis, Mary Beth Ruth, Virginia Hall, Jane Price, Laura Ross, and Alice Stubbs all won
as the team swept the singles competition. The doubles teams of McNelis-Hall and Stubbs-Angela Rudert also won.

The team returned home Monday to open Southern Conference action against ETSU. The Buccaneers proved to be a surprisingly tough
opponent as the Lady Cats had a hard-fought 6-3 victory. The team dropped the number one and two singles and
the number two doubles. However, the rest of the squad came through with victories. Hall, Price, Rudert, and Stubbs all
won in singles while Ruth-Price and Stubbs-Rudert took their doubles matches. Unfortunately, the Lady Cats’ number one player, McNelis, injured
her knee in the match and is out of action indefinitely.

Tuesday, the Lady Cats continued conference play against ASU. The Mountaineers were weaker than expected as Davidson won 9-0. Stubbs
replaced the injured McNelis in the number one slot to lead the team. The other singles winners were Ruth, Hall,
Price, Rudert, and Ross. In the doubles competition, Melissa Carr and Hall, Ruth-Price, and Stubbs-Rudert all won.

Coach Caroline Brown is fairly happy with her team’s performance so far. She is pleased with the strong singles play
she has been getting; however, she is still concerned with the doubles play. In the next few matches, she plans
to juggle the doubles lineup. Another change is the return of Marion Stone from Kenya. As a result of McNelis’
injury, Stone is being thrown right into the lineup. By Friday, Coach Brown expects to have her conference squad set.
The Lady Cats have away matches against Hope and defending conference champion Furman next week.

Sailing team excels at Charleston, Clemson

This spring a resurrected Davidson Sailing Club has defined new horizons to which student sailors may voyage. In February the
club elected new officials and made plans to follow a clearly understood statement of purpose. The Sailing Team, which once
was supported as a varsity team by the college, now operates within the club. This team, which is made up
of those club members with racing experience, competes in the South Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Association. The northern division of this
association consists of College of Charleston, Citadel, Davidson, Duke, N.C. State, Univ. of Tennessee, Univ. of South Carolina, and Vanderbilt.

The spring season in this division consists of three North Point division regattas and a final inter-divisional regatta. In competition
this spring Davidson has placed third in all three North Point regattas. At the first regatta in Charleston, the team
tied for second place with Citadel, but through the tie-breaking procedure Davidson fell to third. In the second regatta at
Clemson, Davidson placed second behind College of Charleston with several victories in A-division only to drop, once again, to third
place due to a whining protest by the Citadel B-division team. At the third regatta held at Citadel last weekend,
Davidson placed a solid third. With these strong performances behind it, the team, with members Peter Bream, John Engel, John
Freeman, Ingrid Love, Ian Prime, and Bob Pulliam, has qualified for the finals which will be held at Univ. of
Florida early in April. If the team places in the top two at this regional regatta, it will be eligible
for the national finals which will be held at Stanford. However, team captain Ian Prime states that team members who
have already purchased non-refundable super-saver plane tickets to California might have been overly optimistic in their expectations.
