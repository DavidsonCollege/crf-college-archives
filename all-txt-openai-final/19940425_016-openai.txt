THE DAVIDSONIAN ARTS & LIVING MONDAY, APRIL 25, 1994

- Retrospective 1993-94

By Josh Larned & Scott McLean

The 1993-94 year proved to be a phenomenal one for the fine arts at Davidson. During this brief period, numerous
elements collided with such force and display of creative genius that it may well signify the beginnings of a Davidson
Renaissance.

Foremost, 1993-94 saw the establishment of the VAC as a new locale for art education and awareness. With its two
galleries, numerous studios, and spacious lecture halls, the edifice provided many unique opportunities for students to cultivate an appreciation for
the visual arts.

In theater, the campus witnessed superb performances by students and visiting companies alike. Equus, Buried Child, the spring student one-acts,
and the Artistâ€™s Series-sponsored Cabaret all performed.

Furthermore, the year experienced the revival of dance on campus. The Davidson Dance Troupe reconvened to put together a solid
spring show. Moreover, famous acts such as Chuck Davis and the African-American Dance Ensemble and Urban Bush Women thrilled audiences
with their expressive displays.

On the music scene, Davidson hosted talented performers from a wide range of genres. The Samples played to an enthused
student audience in Love Auditorium. Renowned composer Milton Babbitt gave a rare concert, unveiling to Davidson listeners a brand-new composition.
Slovenian pianist Dubravka Tomsic demonstrated her mastery of the piano, as she brilliantly interpreted works by Beethoven and Chopin.

This arts revival also included countless lectures from respected scholars, poetry and book readings, student exhibitions, and on-campus films, involving
students, faculty, and the entire Davidson community.
