Davidson Loses At Elon Wins At Winston

Clarke Pitches Good Game But Carolina Wins 4-3.

In the initial game of the North Carolina trip, the Wildcats lost a 15-inning contest to the University of North Carolina by a score of 4 to 3. This, the annual contest between these ancient rivals, was witnessed by a large assembly of enthusiastic fans. The Wildcats had many opportunities to annex the game. A total of fifteen Davidson men were left on bases, but the batter was always lacking with the needed hit. On several occasions, with men on second and third, with only one man down, the Wildcats were unable to make the hit that would count for runs.

The Wildcats were the first to get in the run column, their one tally resulting from a pass and a single to center which went for a three-bagger when the fielder permitted the ball to get away from him. In the second round, Carolina tied up the score with a home run driven over the left field fence by Robbins. The University scored two more in the fourth on a single and three errors. It was in the eighth round that the Wildcats annexed two more runs, assisted by Carolina errors. In the fifteenth, a single by Younts brought in the tally that proved the winner. Two errors and a walk allowed two Davidson men to perch on second and third, with only one man down, in her half of the fifteenth inning. The much-needed hit was not forthcoming, however.

The pitching of Clarke for Davidson, who went the entire route, and the work of Joyner for Carolina, were the outstanding features of the game. The box score:

FIRST ELON GAME.

April 22—In the most thrilling game of baseball ever seen on the Elon diamond, Elon College defeated Davidson College in a 13-inning game, 7 to 6. The game was witnessed by a large crowd and being void of errors and with plenty of “pep” and exciting plays afforded the close observer of baseball what he likes to see.

The game started off with a swatfest for the visitors, four hits in the first frame, scoring three runs. Doughton was replaced by Sides, who pitched a steady game thereafter. Going to the mound with one man on, he held the Presbyterians to five scattered singles the remainder of the game and was complete master in pinches. The Elon team scored one run in the first frame and four in the second, making a tie score of 5 and 5. Davidson managed to score one in the fourth following a base on balls, a sacrifice, and a beautiful squeeze play. Brawn, Elon’s husky right fielder, caught a fast one square on the nose and drove it for a home run, making the score again tie, 6 to 6. From this until the thirteenth inning neither team was able to get the needed run. King’s bad hop to Davidson's second baseman, followed by singles by Murphy and Johnson brought the winning run.

SECOND ELON GAME.

The Wildcats staged a pretty comeback and evened up the series with Elon by a 6 to 3 victory. The game was staged on last Wednesday, the day of Winston's celebration for her returned heroes, and 2,500 persons witnessed the game. After the first frame when the Wildcats chalked up four of their tallies, the race was neck and neck. A one-handed catch by Simpson, of Elon, of a line drive by Richards to deep center after a forty-yard dash was a feature of the game. Currie for Davidson pitched a pretty game, allowing Elon but four hits. Spann placed the ball over the left field fence, with a man on base, for a home run. Ratchford fielded well and landed on the pill for a pretty three-base hit.

CLASS BASEBALL GAMES.

FRESH-SOPH.

In the second game of the inter-class series, the Sophomores lost to the Freshmen by a score of 5 to 2. The game was fast and well played throughout. Murphy pitched air-tight ball for the Freshmen, allowing a total of only three hits. Murray, too, pitched well but allowed the Freshmen to bunch several of their seven hits for their five runs. The Fresh team got off to a good lead in the early part of the game and held it all the way through. Good fielding on the part of their outfield probably prevented further scoring. The pitching of Murray was the main feature for the Sophs. Miller, for the Freshmen, played high-class ball on third and his home run was one of the main features of the game.

Sophomores 2 3 2

Batteries: Murphy and McFadden; Murray and Poteat. Umpire, Love.

FRESH-SENIOR.

In a rather uninteresting game, the Seniors nosed out a 2 to 1 victory over the Freshmen. Neither team was able to connect effectively with the slants of the opposing pitcher. Davenport let the Freshmen down with only three hits, while Miller yielded only two to the Seniors. The Seniors’ runs came as a result of errors by Hyland in the first two innings. The Freshmen threatened to score several times during the game but were unable to get a man past third except in the sixth inning, when McLeod crossed the plate with their only tally. The pitching of Davenport and the catching of Robson featured for the Seniors. Ratchford played a nice game on first for the Freshmen.

Freshmen 1 3 4

Batteries: Davenport and Robson; Miller and McFadden. Umpire, Sitton.

JUNIOR-SOPH.

Thursday afternoon witnessed an old-fashioned slugging match on Sprunt field when the Juniors stacked arms against the Sophomores. The former team was victorious by a score of 13 to 4. Cathey allowed the Sophs only seven scattered hits and received good support from his teammates, while the Juniors hit Douglass often and hard. The score would have been different, however, if it had not been for the numerous errors credited against the Sophs. Murray played a good game in the field for the Sophomores besides getting three successive hits. The entire Junior team played good ball.

Sophomores 4 7 8

SOPH-SENIOR.

On Friday afternoon the Sophomores came back in good form, after making several changes in their lineup, and defeated the Seniors by a score of 9 to 3. Hammett twirled in great style for the Sophs, holding his opponents safe at all stages of the game. Davenport started in the box for the Seniors but was driven to cover in the seventh. Currie, who relieved him, succeeded in holding the Sophs but little better. Douglass starred for the class of ’21, doing great work both with the bat and in left field. Turner played a nice game at short for the Seniors.
