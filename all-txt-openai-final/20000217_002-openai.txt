### THE DAVIDSONIAN

**New Dorm, from page 1.**

The furniture vendors met with students on the Facility Planning Committee on January 20 to discuss options. The student committee
has completed a list of furniture they want to see in the new building. Next week, RLO will reconvene the
committee to confirm their choices. RLO will then give each of the vendors an RFP (Request for Proposal) which states
what type of furniture it wants in the new building. The vendors will then make bids based upon the RFP.
By mid-March, RLO will have signed a contract with the best bidder.

But whatever the natural market forces, RLO needs approximately 55-70 more students on campus this year in order to help
offset the construction costs of the new dormitory. “They [students living off campus] are outside the RLO bed inventory and
cost us more to operate than the students pay to live there,” explains Holmes. Depending on the number of students
that study abroad next fall, RLO presently expects to give off-campus permission to approximately 60-65 students.

RLO staff expect the new dormitory to have a profound impact on Davidson. “The new dorm will shift perception of
what Davidson’s dorms are like,” says Holmes. Davidson’s dorms were recently ranked 13th in the country by the Princeton Review
as “Dorms like Palaces.” This ranking was based on a survey of student opinion. Holmes believes that the new dorm
will greatly increase the overall quality of student life on campus. With the greater capacity to house students, fewer students
will receive permission to live off campus next year. “Historically, we have had about 120 students living off-campus,” says Holmes.
Typically, off-campus permission is given to approximately 40 seniors, 60 juniors, and 20 sophomores. Holmes cites several reasons for reducing
the number of students living off campus, but he believes that student satisfaction in the new building will go a
long way toward reducing the requests for off-campus living. “We firmly believe that this building [the new dorm] will be
attractive enough to draw some people back to campus housing who have gone off because they couldn’t get a single,”
he says.

**Construction Details**

The new dorm is being built on land once occupied by Lingle Manor. Construction on the new dorm didn’t begin
until October 9, when Lingle Manor was demolished in less than one hour by a demolition team. November 1999 saw
preparations for building being made. It was not until excavations on the land were done that the foundation could be
poured. On December 18, when many Davidson students were at home, asleep in their beds after fall semester, the foundation
was poured at 2 a.m.

**Parking and Traffic**

Because of the restructuring of the roadway and the loss of some parking across from PIKA, there will be 100
new parking spaces created along Patterson Court road and in satellite lots. Dean Holmes acknowledges that the perception is that
parking and traffic flow will be adversely affected by the change, but he says that the effect will most likely
be neutral, and may even be beneficial. At present, the construction has had a significant effect on parking. Construction fences
behind the new dorm and near the Knobloch Campus Center have eliminated approximately 150 spots. This loss has forced a
shift in student parking to the Baker and Satellite lots. During the summer months, the road reconnecting between SigEp and
PIKA will be completed. Another plan has the road reconnecting further down, at the present entrance to Satellite parking.

**New Dorm Features**

- Eight singles per floor
- Two-bedroom suites with common rooms
- One hall-wide lounge per floor
- Elevator to every floor
- Handicap-accessible suite on every flooror needed private/semi-private baths,” says Holmes. “It constitutes the residential area on campus,” says Holmes.
Where Glasgow Street once ran down past Richardson, there will be a courtyard. After the change, the present exit from
Belk Parking Lot will also serve as the entrance. Glasgow will now run between the new residence hall and the
Health Center. Currently, there are two possibilities for the reconnection between Glasgow Street and Patterson Court Road. One plan has
the new dorm available for conferences and camps. The ground floor will include a multi-purpose conference room as well as
the Office of Public Safety.

Lottery
Lottery for single rooms is on April 4. Doubles will be available on April 19. The rooms in the new
dorm will be available on both these dates.

Cader Howard
Residence Life hopes the new dorm, scheduled to be completed in August, will draw students back on campus.

George Gee and His Make-believe Ballroom Orchestra waltzed into Love Auditorium last Wednesday. Their sashay, however, was conspicuously absent from
their performance.

The crowd clapped appreciatively as the orchestra, sans George Gee, came onstage. They remained standing, while three female vocalists began
a beautiful three-part acapella rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner.” About halfway through the song, the crowd, bewildered as to why
the national anthem was being sung at a jazz concert, rose to the occasion.

Then came George. The iconoclastic bandleader sauntered onstage, relaxed, gleeful, and smacking chewing gum between his teeth. Billed as “the
first—and only—Chinese American Bandleader,” Gee’s thick New York accent reinforced his band’s mission to bring the audience a review of
New York-style swing.

The orchestra began with a swing classic, “Take the A-Train,” typified by a searing trumpet solo. The band was sluggish
in tackling the task of backing up such an impassioned solo, implementing scripted growls and wails that are all too
characteristic of jazz. “Ho, get ‘em boys,” yelled Gee, skipping around the stage and snapping his fingers to the beat.
Hey, at least they were having fun.

The next song proved to be a bit disappointing as well. Gee called out a dance troupe, cleverly dubbed the
“Grit Grinders.” For a band as seemingly professional as Gee’s (they were the first swing band to appear on MTV),
the dancers were surprisingly amateur, with limited moves and out-of-synch twists and turns. The audience politely applauded for the Grit
Grinders as they mercifully left the stage.

The orchestra’s attempt to inject some new life into old songs was earnest and praiseworthy, but the endeavor failed to
convince this attendee. Music Director and tenor sax player Lance Bryant (does Gee do anything except snap his fingers?) appeared
behind the mic for “Everyday I Have the Blues.” Unfortunately, in singing this blues classic he sounded more like present-day
crooner Stevie Wonder and less like tortured blues master Robert Johnson. He proved to contain better sax chops than vocal
ones in a riveting and seemingly effortless solo on his original “Buzzing Baby.” The rich baritone of trumpeter/vocalist Walt Szymanski
was truer to jazz singing than Lance’s attempt.

Erroll Garner’s “Misty” was done great justice by featured vocalist June Gardner, but the soulful sultry chanteuse could not apologize
for a muddled, uninspiring, tired, and altogether boring experience. But perhaps I’m becoming a bit of a jazz snob. The
crowd enjoyed themselves, embodied by the bouncing pigtails of a little girl a few rows in front of me. While
it lacked the intensity of a Brian Setzer collaboration and the technical wizardry that has garnered acclaim for Wynton Marsalis’s
latest big band resurrection, George Gee succeeded in entertaining most of the audience for two sets, seeking not to alienate
but to entertain.
