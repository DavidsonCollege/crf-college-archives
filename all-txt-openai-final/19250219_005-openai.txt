‘THE DAVIDSONIAN, FEBRUARY 19, 1925

Puzzle This Week is Teaser From Start to Finish and is Guaranteed to Please

John Russell Talley, who hails from the city of spindles, was the winner of last week's cross-word puzzle contest. For his trouble or pleasure, as it might be, he received a Davidson pennant to hang upon the walls of his boudoir. This puzzle was made by Fred Coffman, who is a civil engineer engaged in construction work in Davidson. The main complaint about the puzzles thus far is that they have been far too easy for the intellectual luminaries of this institution. One fellow said that he worked his puzzle regularly while walking up from the post office. The puzzle this week has been worked with the idea in mind of curing this seeming defect. Fred Smith is the progenitor of the last thing, and it is guaranteed to be a sure cure, a sure-fire antidote for an attack of mental laziness. The words are not especially hard but there are some catchy connections attached to them. To the one who brings the solution to the managing editor, a subscription to The Davidsonian will be given. It's easy, fellows. If you are an optimist, fill in the squares with a fountain pen; if you are dubious of your linguistic powers, work it with a pencil and have an eraser on hand. All members of the fair sex are invited to participate. The way is open—first correct solution here goes!

WILLIAMS IS PRINCIPAL SPEAKER NEXT SUNDAY

The program at “Y” next Sunday promises to be one of the best meetings of the year. Mr. Williams and two students are to be heard, and it is expected that practically the entire student body will turn out. This service is more or less an echo meeting of the North American Missionary Convention which was held in Washington this winter. The student body was represented by Harry Price and Norman Patterson. Mr. Williams, who is to be in charge of the meeting, will make an introductory speech outlining the activities of the conference, bringing out the main thoughts gathered, and telling of the wonderful talks that they heard, starting with the address by President Coolidge and going on to the masterful speech by Dr. R. E. Speer.

Over a thousand people from five continents attended this meeting, and everyone carried to the ones he was representing a real message.
