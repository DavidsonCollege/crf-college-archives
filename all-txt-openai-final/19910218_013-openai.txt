Alumnus Workman Sings Opera At Davidson
By Wes Martin

How many Davidson graduates do you know who become bankers? Lawyers? Doctors? What about famous opera singers? Davidson has produced at least one great opera singer, and he returned Tuesday night to perform in Love Auditorium for many old friends, classmates, professors, and even old high school teachers, as well as present students and faculty.

William Workman began singing as soon as he could talk, and he still remembers when he learned what opera was from his father at age six. He attended the Curtis Institute, which is an all-scholarship school for which he had to audition. If he got in, he would study there; if not, he would return to Davidson to major in English. As things turned out, Workman did both. He was accepted to the Curtis Institute where he studied under Martial Singher, a French musician, and during the summers, he returned to Davidson to squeeze courses in during the summer. (Davidson used to have summer sessions.) During his last year at Curtis, they offered him a three-year contract with the Hamburg State Opera.

Workman says that while he has lived in Germany for most of his adult life, he is an American, and if he had to choose between the two countries, he would probably move back to the United States. He believes that he could never have become the singer he has become if he lived in the States. “I am extremely grateful for what they have allowed me to do,” Workman said of his feelings for Germany and the German people. “Most great educators during my time were Europeans who left during the Nazi years. I have contributed to Germany because I am a bearer of European culture, and at the same time, I have contributed much to the European culture.”

Tuesday night, Workman sang Winterreise (A Winter's Journey), a work of lieder. “When you’re doing lieder, it’s almost like having a date with music... it is very intimate,” Workman said.

Workman always had the idea of becoming an opera singer in the back of his mind. When he was 17, Workman won a contest for a summer scholarship to attend the Transylvania Music Camp (which is now the Brevard Music Camp) on a scholarship from WBT. There, he found out that he had real potential to do something with his voice, and the childhood dreams of becoming a professional singer began to materialize.

Nevertheless, Workman says that he came to Davidson the next fall and had a “normal freshman year,” taking some music classes. After his freshman year, however, Workman had to decide if he wanted to try to study music seriously, which would mean studying at a conservatory where he could develop as a musician, or if he wanted to continue his studies at Davidson.

He decided to apply to the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia, planning to return after the contract ran out, but he still hasn’t moved back after almost 30 years. The Hamburg Opera asked him to stay for four more years, and then Christoph von Dohnanyi offered him a position with the Frankfurt Opera that he could not refuse. He was the leading baritone at Frankfurt, where he says that he had “plenty of free time, good friends, the repertoire that I wanted to sing.” He also did a lot of “guesting”--touring to other opera houses. He felt he had sung almost all of the works that he wanted to sing, and that he wanted to move on to something that he “found [he] was rather good at--teaching.” At that time, he wanted to perform in concerts and to sing in lieder instead of continuing to sing opera. He was offered a professorship in Hamburg, so he and his family recently moved back there.written by Franz Schubert. Lieder, translated literally, means “songs,” but the word refers to a German genre of music that began as early as Mozart. “Opera is a very robust sort of thing—almost athletic. I loved doing it; but when you’re doing lieder, it’s almost like having a date with music... it is very intimate,” Workman said. Winterreise is Schubert’s masterpiece, and it was the last work he wrote before his death. While this piece was not popular at first, Workman explains, people grew to love it. He sang it instead of other songs that people might recognize because he felt that even though all of the 24 songs are in German, the audience can still feel the meaning of the music because of its intensity and beauty.

Comparative Shopping Needed For Student Housing?
By Leigh McKeever

When a prospective homeowner goes “shopping” for accommodation, agents go out of their way to make the buyer the best possible offer for the best money. Renting or buying is a one-shot deal, and most people comparative shop in order to make that decision. With the housing lottery around the corner, it is just as important for students to do a little comparison shopping of their own. So, what exactly are you getting for your money at Davidson College? Estimates for next year break down as follows: A single or a senior apartment can be “rented” for $279.11 a month; a double rents for $228.88/month; a triple, for $167.00/month. These prices are inclusive of all utility bills. However, beginning next year, an additional and non-optional $5 per month will be added so that those living in the Apartments and Smith House can enjoy cable. This brings their bill to $284.11 each month.

According to Richard Terry, rent collected on the senior apartments just breaks even with the outstanding mortgage. Every other dormitory on campus has long since been paid for, thus all surplus monies go to the general college fund. Davidson makes a profit from your rent. Housing is indeed a service, but it too conforms to the capitalistic profit motive. If you choose to live off-campus, what sort of a price range should you be expecting? Sandra Smith and Millicent McKeithen live in a shared apartment with two single bedrooms (that are each about the size of two traditional dorm rooms), a full kitchen, sitting room, and a full bath. With utilities and toilet paper (dormitories get this for “free”), their monthly bill comes to $210.00 a month. They also live within walking distance of the campus, closer to Chambers than the Apartments. Seventy dollars less than it costs to have the same facilities on campus.

Lyndsey Forsyth, who lives in the Oak Hill Apartments across from FIJI, pays $330 each month. This price includes utilities, one bedroom, a full kitchen, and a living room. Living off-campus seems to offer more for the money, as long as you don’t mind being a bit removed from the day-to-day campus life. Being able to sleep in your own room all night long without twenty-eight other people on your hall, all with different living habits, might be worth the three or four minute walk or bike ride to campus. Davidson also reserves the right to require you to live on campus. Given this year’s overcrowding situation, receiving off-campus permission is not a problem. But, if Davidson is ever not able to fill its dormitories, they can refuse to give you permission to live anywhere but in the college’s facilities. In 1989-1990 Davidson had fifty vacancies, and lost $100,000 in revenue. The permission requirement protects the college from losing their profits. Spring housing lottery is including rooms in an unbuilt new apartment. Residence Life does not guarantee that this building will be constructed on time. If the new apartment is not finished, then those students waiting to move in will be forced to live in dorm lounges. Is it worth the money?
