**OPINIONS 8 MONDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 1994**

The recent murder of an abortion doctor by a pro-life activist has been in the news lately. Paul Hill, the
activist in question, is defending himself, though the judge has disallowed a defense based on the morality of abortion. The
idea of how he could defend such an act intrigued me. Its consideration leads to a difficult discussion of legality
versus morality.

The quick assumption made by most upon hearing about this case was disgust at those crazy, Christian zealots. This quick
condemnation will no doubt be borne out in the decision of the jury. Let us consider the matter from Hill’s
perspective. He, like other pro-life supporters, believes that life begins at conception. If life begins at conception, then abortion at
any time would be considered murder. Doctors who perform these procedures would be not just murderers but mass murderers. Hill
passionately believes in these ideas, which by frustration of legal means led him to this extreme remedy.

Is the assumption that life begins at conception illogical or crazy? Not even the most ardent pro-choice supporter could argue
that case. I will not judge which is right, but the time at which Hill believes that life begins is
much clearer and logical than the vague trimester system established in Roe v. Wade. So, we have a man who
believes strongly in, at the very least, a logical assumption. It would be hard to call him crazy for believing
as he does.

Imagine yourself a citizen of Nazi Germany. You come to believe in the rumor — none too popular or logical
to the other citizens at the time — that the government is exterminating the Jews. You journey out to one
of the death camps, and there you see it occurring before your eyes. There is no legal recourse for you
to stop the murders. Would killing one of the men committing these atrocities be a justified murder? Do not the
deaths of many justify the killing of this one? This metaphor, though troubling, is relevant. Hill is willing to sacrifice
his own life — just as the German citizen might have done — because how could he live with himself
if he did nothing? What else is a martyr but someone willing to sacrifice himself for a cause? The cause
that he will probably die for is not a crazy, baseless cult. Should we condemn this man out of hand
for acting to prevent further atrocities? It seems that history is the judge of martyrs; though we may condemn him
perhaps in twenty years, he will be praised as one of the first freedom fighters for the liberty of fetuses.

I neither attempt to persuade the reader of this article to go out and kill abortion doctors, nor do I
advocate an innocent verdict for this “murderer.” I do ask that you consider the paradigm from which you judge him
versus his own paradigm of the world. The case against him is not black versus white or as simple as
it may seem at first glance.

Bring back the meaningful conversations. The singles scene used to be more efficient than it is today. At bars, men
and women could initiate conversations with each other as easily as John Travolta could dance. In the good old days,
the process was straightforward, simple, and known to all. The only requirement was the use of a common ritual: the
lighting of a cigarette. When a woman wanted to meet a member of the opposite sex, all she had to
do was pull out a cigarette and start frantically searching through her purse as if she could not find her
box of matches. A guy would immediately pick up on this signal and swoop to the woman’s rescue by offering
his lighter. The woman then had the perfect opportunity to offer an opening line.

“Thanks for the light. Would you like a cigarette, too?”

“Sure.”

“By the way, what’s your name?”

“John — but my friends call me Meat-Head. What’s yours?”

“I forget.”

“Great. Can I buy you a drink?”

The simple offering of a light enabled such conversations to flourish. These days, however, with the new health craze, asking
a guy for a light is just about as glamorous as asking him to brush your teeth. No common rituals
at bars apply anymore. Women must depend on guys to have random pick-up lines, which usually lead to meaningless...conversations.

“Don’t I know you from somewhere?”
“I don’t think so.”
“Where are you from?”
“Hell.”
“Great. Me too. Can I buy you a drink?”

The conversations simply don’t have as much depth as they used to when people smoked. The lack of a common
ritual favors the man who can make small talk and think fast on his feet. The shy guy, meanwhile, drowns
in his quiet ways by playing Pac-Man in the corner, hoping some female will be intrigued by his phenomenal video-game
talent. This system just isn’t as fair to everyone.

Well, here I am in Somalia, Haiti, the Mid. East. It’s hot, dirty, and full of salt water and sand.
However, I enjoy helping here, and the people are kind. I met a boy whose name is Mubatu Jean-Claude. I
should be home soon, hopefully after Christmas.

The fact is, the singles scene has lost its purity. We need to go back to the roots of pick-up
bars by forming a new common ritual consistent with the times. Let’s face it, cigarettes are out and health food
is in. Why don’t we try something like non-fat, low-salt pretzels? Women could bring in a bag and act like
they can’t open it themselves. Men could then show off their rippling muscles and masculinity by offering help with opening
the troublesome bag. The ritual would lessen the awkwardness of the first line for everyone, and the transition into a
meaningful conversation would be so much more true and natural.

“Hello. Can I help you open that?”
“Sure. I don’t know why they always make these pretzel bags so difficult.”
“I don’t, either. By the way, where are you from?”
“Hell.”
“Great. Me too. Can I buy you a drink?”

The transcript change proposal should remain a proposal. A few weeks ago in The Davidsonian, there appeared an article that
outlined a proposed plan to change Davidson transcripts in an effort to combat the nationwide phenomenon of grade inflation. Under
this system, transcripts will include not simply the grade the student received in each course, but also the average grade
in the class and the number of students enrolled in that class. As if Davidson were not difficult enough already,
some group called the Davidson Efficiency Task Force feels it is their duty to further complicate our lives with this
inane plan.

Students who routinely receive grades in the C or D range will be doubly punished. Not only will their lower
GPA hurt them, but they will seem less capable. Do we really need to penalize students whose passing grades from
this school alone should be considered a significant accomplishment? The only possible advantage of the proposed system would emerge when
a class GPA is very, very low. In this instance, extra credit would be given to all students who received
a passing grade. The problem with this assertion is that if the class GPA was so low to begin with,
then we would no longer be dealing with that evil plague of grade inflation. So there would be no reason
for printing class averages.

Think about it for a minute — Davidson has one of the most difficult workloads in the country, and is
now ranked among the top 10 national liberal arts colleges. Why, then, do we feel the need to justify the
quality of students that graduate from here? This system has no real advantages to the students and will end up
penalizing more than helping. Students who maintain A or B averages are going to look good coming from Davidson anyway,
so showing that their grade is higher than the class average will not help them that much. On the other
hand, if the class median grade is high, these students will be punished because their accomplishments will seem less impressive.

Most Davidson students will tell you that an A or B grade at this school is extremely challenging to attain,
regardless of class averages. On the other end of the spectrum, students who routinely receive grades in the C or
D range will be doubly punished. Not only will their lower GPA hurt them, but when compared to a higher
overall class average, they will seem less capable.

Maybe the reason I feel so strongly about this issue is because I certainly haven’t seen any grade inflation at
Davidson. Perhaps if I suddenly began receiving undeserved A’s and B’s (or C’s for that matter), then I would be
able to see this committee’s stand. However, as I have not, I insist that the newly-proposed system lends no advantages
to anyone and should remain only a “proposed” change.
