**Rosenbach, Sabel to take over SGA**

By Martha Knight

The Student Government Association held elections on Tuesday, February 1. Run-offs, which took place on Wednesday, determined the final results. Eric Rosenbach was elected SGA President, Allison Sabel as SGA Vice-President. Sean Callahan and Jay Jennings will serve the Honor Council as the new Student Solicitors; the new Defense Advisors are Mati Hunoval and Lorie Logan.

Rosenbach feels strongly about several issues. He is concerned about the rapport between students, faculty, and trustees. Rosenbach hopes to promote a better understanding among these groups and to “build a relationship beyond the academic environment.” He also plans to act on the need for a new Student Union and to “push for issues that will unify the school.”

Current SGA president Alden Smith says, "I think Eric and Allison will make an effective team which can continue to encourage the college to stand for its students whether they be white or African-American, Christian or Hindu, straight or homosexual."

More than half of the student body cast their votes.

**February celebrates black history and culture**

By Jay Jennings

Davidson College celebrates Black History Month in hopes of educating students and the community on the accomplishments of African-Americans. The Martin Luther King, Jr. Worship Service and Songfest on January 20 marked the initiation of the activities which will end on March 1 with the Johnson C. Smith Jazz Band Ensemble performance.

Dr. Carter G. Woodson initiated the tradition of celebrating the accomplishments of African-Americans when he organized the first Black History Week on February 12, 1926. Woodson hoped to preserve the long history of African-Americans from around the world and to educate society on this history. Woodson’s commemorative week was expanded to a month in the 1960s when the African-American movement gained more strength.

The Black History Month celebration at Davidson seeks to maintain the ideas of Woodson. John Eaves, Assistant Dean of Students, said that he hopes the events will “inform, enlighten, sensitize students of the accomplishments and achievements of African-Americans.” Eaves wants all students to feel welcome at any of the events which are designed for attendance by all students and community members. At the MLK, Jr. Worship Service and Songfest, a mix of community members and students came together to celebrate the life of a very important man in the history of African-Americans.

Dr. Jawanza Kunjufu will address the issue of negative societal influences on African-American youth.

ABC’s "Good Morning America," President Bill Clinton, and the Charlotte Observer's front page commended Davidson alum Ann Clark as the 1994 National Principal of the Year. Clark accepted the award and $10,000 at a ceremony in Washington D.C. on January 26 from the National Associations of Secondary School Principals, co-sponsored by Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. At age 35, Clark is relatively young in her field.field. After teaching for three years, she became assistant principal at Devonshire Elementary in Charlotte. Then she became principal of Alexander Graham Middle School.

Alum named Principal of the Year

Clark was selected from 150 principals. When she received the award, she gave a “Message to America," focusing on her vision for public education, her belief system, and her teaching credo.

In 1980 Clark graduated from Davidson as an English major. She received her master's of education from the University of Virginia and her Ph.D. in Education Administration from UNC-Chapel Hill. In 1986 she was awarded the First Union Outstanding Educator Award, Teacher of the Year in 1986-87. This year Clark swept Charlotte-Mecklenburg, N.C., and finally the National Principal of the Year.

Baker reopens weight rooms to all students

By Katherine Hash

In the face of strong student opposition, the Athletic Administration reevaluated its decisions regarding them. The downstairs weight room facilities and upstairs weight room will reopen to all students early this week.

Aware of discontent with the current arrangement, Director of Physical Education Ron Morrow accepted SGA president Alden Smith’s invitation to address the SGA last Tuesday night. Morrow maintained that the Athletic Administration’s decisions to close the downstairs weight room to non-varsity athletes and to convert the upstairs racquetball court into a new weight room had been efforts to satisfy student requests for longer Baker hours and to alleviate overcrowding in the weight rooms.

He admitted that the administration might have been hasty in taking a deal which “seemed too good to pass up” without consulting students. Nautilus offered to sell the new equipment now in the upstairs weight room to Davidson at government cost on a five-year payment plan.

Morrow assured the SGA that the administration was willing to work with the students to find a more satisfactory arrangement and presented three alternatives:
1) Remove the new equipment and go back to the old arrangement.
2) Leave the new equipment where it is, move the free weights into the Lapko room and reopen it to all students.
3) Same as option 2, but charge students for the use of Knobloch indoor tennis courts, using the revenues to buy Nautilus to replace the Lapko equipment downstairs.

SGA senator Chris Edmonston cautioned Morrow that charging students to use Knobloch would generate even more opposition. Other Senators showed support for option 2 which seems to get rid of most of the problems students had with the new arrangement—no more separation of students and athletes, access to free weights without having to commit to a schedule, no more team workout times and required coach supervision.

A trained work-study student will supervise the downstairs weight room which will house both free weights and Lapko equipment. Those using free weights will be required to lift with a partner or a spotter. The 3-5 p.m. varsity athlete priority rule will be enforced downstairs—when the room becomes too crowded. During these hours non-varsity athletes will be asked to leave. Otherwise, the room will be open.
