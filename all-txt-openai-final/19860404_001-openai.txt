**Warnke’s speech highlights Nuclear Awareness Week**

By ANDREA GROSS

Paul Warnke, former Director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, gave a keynote address on “The Nuclear Arms Picture” Wednesday night as part of Nuclear Awareness Week. The week, which was sponsored by the YSSC Nuclear Forum and the Dean Rusk Program, also featured Reagan administration spokesman Robert Simmons and Retired Navy Commander William Withrow, speaking on various aspects of arms control and disarmament.

Before an audience of 300, Warnke criticized President Reagan’s proposed Strategic Defense Initiative, calling it “an article of faith,” which “has nothing to do with logic.” He said: “The problem with SDI is that it has to work perfectly the first time. And we know that nothing works perfectly, not even a Volkswagen.” Warnke said he approved of the U.S. intentions at the recent November summit: “The lyrics were indistinct, but at least the mood music was good.” However, he said that Reagan’s actions “since that time have been disappointing.” Concerning the Soviet Union’s January proposal to eliminate all nuclear arms from the planet by the year 2000, Warnke said he “found some seeds of hope” in the plan. He said that total elimination of all arms “can’t be done.” However, he added, “If it’s a bluff, let’s call the bluff.”

Yesterday, Mr. Robert Simmons of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency outlined the progress of the current Geneva arms control negotiations. Simmons, who is Deputy Director of the Theater Affairs Division of the Strategic Programs Bureau in the agency, said that the negotiations are divided into three areas: the Strategic Arms Reductions Talks (START), the Intermediate Range Nuclear Force Talks (INF), and the space weapons talks.

Simmons said the negotiations are taking place under “two contexts,” — summits and SALT II. The summit context includes the series of planned Reagan-Gorbachev meetings, around which the arms negotiations revolve. The first of these meetings took place in Geneva in November. Commenting on the future of summitry, Simmons said: “I don’t think that you'll see Gorbachev coming in May, but I think that he will come some time this year.” The SALT II context involves the SALT II treaty, to which both the U.S. and Soviet Union have claimed to adhere, though the treaty was never actually ratified. This treaty would have expired in Dec. 1985.

Simmons said that Reagan and Gorbachev agreed to two “high priorities” in the negotiations. These include a fifty percent reduction of strategic offensive systems and an “interim INF agreement.” Yet he noted that problems of “effective verification,” “linkage,” “transfer of technology,” and Gorbachev's “apparent lack of seriousness” have impeded a final settlement in the negotiations.

Retired Navy Commander William Withrow also spoke to Davidson students and faculty yesterday about the necessity of nuclear arms control. Withrow said that the present combined tonnage of TNT in the U.S. and Soviet nuclear arsenals is 6,000 times that of the bombs used in all of World War II. Withrow added that if the U.S. continues to build its nuclear arsenal at current rates, the costs of the arms buildup will eventually wreck the U.S. economy.

“Nuclear Awareness Week” also featured films on the arms race and talks by Davidson faculty. On Tuesday, If You Love This Planet and Countdown for America, two films...reflecting opposite views of the nuclear arms race, were shown. On Wednesday, Religion Professor David Kaylor and Physics Professor Allen Wolf spoke on “The Theology and Technology of S.D.I."

Potok discusses polarization of individual, society

By HEIDI HOOKER

Pulitzer Prize winner Chaim Potok spoke as the Reynolds Lecturer Wednesday, March 26 in Love Auditorium on “Authority and Rebellion: The Individual in Modern Literature” and gave a reading of his works corresponding to that lecture Thursday, March 27 in Chambers Gallery. Potok is respected as an author of a series of five best-selling novels: The Chosen, The Promise, In the Beginning, My Name is Asher Lev, and Wanderings. His most recent work was The Book of Lights. Potok is active in conservative Judaism.

Potok lectured on his theories concerning the polarization of the individual and society as revealed in modern literature in terms of various types of value confrontations. He discussed the formation of cultures based on the command attempt to answer “four o’clock in the a.m. questions.” Potok explained that the responses and values that become intrinsic to a culture make it logically open to confrontations of different kinds. Potok discussed literature including his own novels as a portrayal of individuals against different backdrops of culture.

The four different cultural value confrontations he presented were core to core, core to periphery, periphery to core, and periphery to periphery. The core to periphery confrontation involves an absorption of value within a culture periphery by the core value system of a society. While there is no alteration of the core culture in this case, in periphery to core confrontations, the culture’s periphery is changed significantly by the culture’s core. The periphery to periphery confrontation yields great cultural alterations. Potok described that when cultures fuse in these confrontations and change each other, both sides become richer. However, he explained that man is terrified of ideas outside of his cultural systems because he often does not have enough strength to deal with these ideas that threaten his current understanding. Strength of intellectual confrontation may be derived from education, according to Potok.

In terms of culture in America, Potok remarked that colleges and universities play the role of “power plants of Western culture.” He explained that America’s civilization is still in cultural formation, developing around a growing core of values.

In terms of his own writing, Potok commented that as an author he “creates worlds out of words on paper.” He linked his abilities to his Jewish background, perceiving Judaism as a word world and a text world. Through the novel, he believes the author shapes a world of ideas. He commented, “The author’s vision serves as eyeglasses through which the readers see the world.”

In his reading on Thursday, Potok turned to his own novels as models of confrontations in culture which he discussed Wednesday night. Potok’s stories center around the problem of the “human adventure:” how one holds onto the values of his old world when navigating through new worlds. Potok discussed The Chosen as a fundamental core to core confrontation. He interpreted Danny's exposure to Freud and its effects on Danny's faith, revealing how man reinterprets alien systems of thought. In value confrontations, one “operates with a process of selective affinity” which involves the “compartmentalization” of ideas.
