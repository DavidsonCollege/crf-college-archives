**Track team opens new season**

Stepping into the sunlit outdoors for the first meet of the season on Friday afternoon, the Davidson women’s track and field team set its standards for the rest of the year. The Wildcats competed in the Charlotte 49er Classic at UNC-Charlotte’s Irwin Belk track, and posted several reputable marks over the course of the weekend.

Sophomore distance runner Laura Puckett ran a strong 5000-meter race to place third overall with a time of 18:45.27. Trailing Puckett were sophomore Emily Einstein (19:18.89) and senior Caroline Little (20:19.23). The Friday night race was the first of 2002 for Little, who dealt with injuries during 2001.

In the middle-distance, freshman Anna Brew led the way in the 1500-meter run with a 4:53.01. Finishing behind Brew was a Wildcat pack consisting of junior Liz Gross (5:13.12), and freshmen Lindley Swartz (5:14.24), Sarah Baxter (5:15.70), and Genny Hanisek (5:38.10).

The sprint groups performed commendably as well. Junior Jenny DiCosmo finished just over a second off the school record in the 100-meter dash with her time of 13.67. DiCosmo also finished strong in the 200-meter dash. Her 28.88 fell just short of freshman teammate Clarissa Carr (28.40) but right in front of sophomore Kate Wilson (29.33) and junior Jana Yee (29.42).

All in all, noted co-captain Gross, the first outdoor meet ended well for the ’Cats. “It was a great start to our outdoor season,” she said, “and we can only hope to improve with each race.”

Injury and loss in numbers have both plagued the women’s team this year. Junior Shaw Hipsher and sophomores Jenna Kruppa and Elizabeth Trexler have all been out with injuries during 2002, forcing coaches Jennifer Straub and Adam Johnson to scramble for a full roster. However, the current ’Cats will tackle the season regardless of numbers, keeping the conference championships within reach on April 19.

The Wildcats’ next challenge will be at home this weekend. Davidson will host the Third Annual Irwin Belk Invitational, beginning Saturday at noon in Richardson Stadium.

The men’s track and field team took advantage of the weekend’s beautiful weather as they opened the new outdoor season with a solid performance at the Charlotte 49er Classic. With senior standout Dan Gibson unable to run, the rest of the team stepped up and delivered sound results in both the sprinting and distance events.

The weekend’s top performance belonged to senior Jay Jahnes, who led the men’s distance team with a 17th place in the 1500-meter and a 23rd place in the 3000-meter. Jahnes crossed the 1500-meter finish line in 4:02.85 and was closely followed by sophomore teammate Greg Scott, who placed 18th with a time of 4:03.23.

Davidson also had close finishes in the 5000-meter, in which Wildcats Chris Schmader, Dave Bunge, and Brad Becken all finished within two seconds of each other. Schmader led the Wildcat pack with a time of 15:50.31, putting himself in 27th place. Bunge and Becken followed with times of 15:52.15 and 15:52.87, respectively.

Last weekend was also junior Jimmy Swansbrough’s return to action after missing the indoor season due to injury. Swansbrough competed in both the 1500-meter and 3000-meter, contributing strong opening performances in both events.

Freshman John Leverett stepped up this past weekend as he led the men’s sprinting team on the track in the shorter events. Leverett ran an 11.22 in the 100-meter and a 23.51 in the 200-meter, the top Wildcat finisher in both events. He was followed by junior co-captain Greg Schernecke in the 100-meter with a time of 11.28 and sophomore Drew Weber in the 200-meter with a time of 24.21.

Andrew Pratt also gave a strong performance last weekend, as he was Davidson’s top competitor in the 400-meter dash with a time of 52.39. Freshman Paul Wyatt was just behind him with a time of 52.78.

In the 800-meter, Davidson’s top runner was sophomore David Oyler, who finished the race with a time of 2:03.16. Drew Weber was Davidson’s fastest hurdler last weekend, as he finished the 110-meter high hurdles in a time of 16.76 and the 400-meter hurdles with a time of 1:00.05.

The Wildcats displayed their depth as they posted two teams in the 4x400 relay. Davidson’s first team finished in 3:29.17, and the second team followed them in 3:35.34.

Davidson will look for a strong performance before a large home crowd this upcoming weekend, as they return to action in the only home meet of the season, the Irwin Belk Invitational.

**Baseball skids into spring losing streak, falls to 0-6 in SoCon**

In accordance with that age-old saying, March certainly did come in like a lion.for the Davidson baseball team. With most of the campus away on spring break, the Columbia University Lions stormed into town on that first weekend in March and, following the cancellation of Saturday’s games due to rain, downed the Wildcats 14-8 in the opener of the Sunday doubleheader. Senior co-captain Billy Ryan provided the offensive spark for Davidson, knocking in four RBIs off three hits and scoring two runs despite the loss. Tim Frend (1-1) went the distance in the Sunday afternoon match-up, yielding just 7 hits and striking out 6 while hitting his third home run of the season. Freshman Michael Muniz unloaded his first career round-tripper and junior DJ Dailey added an RBI, but Frend was the real star as the Maine native went 2-for-4 with 4 RBIs in leading Davidson to the 7-4 win.

Facing North Carolina A&T only two days later, the Wildcats nearly wasted a strong outing by junior Mark Wells (1-1), who threw 5 solid innings, giving up just four hits and an unearned run, while striking out six against four walks. Frend once again led the offense, going 3-for-5, and Ryan added two runs as the ’Cats held on for the 7-6 win.

In the conference opener for both clubs, The Citadel Bulldogs squeaked by the visiting Wildcats 4-3. Davidson mustered only three hits on the evening and squandered a 3-2 lead in the bottom of the eighth. Ryan led all hitters with 2 RBIs and Frend once again proved himself worthy on the mound, allowing just 2 earned runs off 5 hits. The following day, Davidson tied the ballgame with three runs in the seventh only to watch the Bulldogs’ designated hitter lace a two-run single in the bottom of the eighth for an 8-6 Citadel win. Frend and Ryan each had 2 RBIs and Dailey went 3-for-5 in the losing effort. The Citadel completed the weekend sweep the next day, cruising to a 5-3 victory as Davidson dropped to 0-3 in Southern Conference play and 7-9 overall. Wells went 6 1/3 innings, giving up just 3 earned runs, but a couple of costly errors allowed the Bulldogs to plate two additional runs. Offensively, Ryan led the charge going 3-for-5 with one run, but The Citadel’s All-American closer came on in the eighth to shut the door on the Davidson nine.

Ending their five-game road trip against the University of South Carolina, the Wildcats were shut out 15-0 by the nationally ranked Gamecocks. Five pitchers combined to hold Davidson to just one hit, as #6 South Carolina improved its record to 16-2 on the year. The Gamecocks recorded all of their runs in the first three innings before the ’Cats bullpen could finally combat the offensive barrage. Ryan reached on an infield single and was walked, and a pitch hit freshman Kenny Devenney as Davidson placed only 3 men on base all game.

Looking to end their four-game losing skid, the Diamond ’Cats returned to the friendly confines of Wildcat Park for a weekend home-stand with Georgia Southern, who has won the past two regular season SoCon titles. The Eagles took both games of Saturday’s doubleheader by a combined score of 22-7. In game one, Georgia Southern scored seven runs in the top of the second and never looked back as they cruised to the 17-5 win. For the Wildcats, Benefield had a pair of hits, including a two-run double, and junior Matt Young jacked his first collegiate homer in the ninth as a pinch-hitter. Frend (1-2) suffered the loss after giving up 12 runs, but only five earned, in five innings. The nightcap produced a similar result as three Eagles pitchers held the ’Cats to just 8 hits, striking out ten, and Georgia Southern improved to a perfect 5-0 in SoCon play with the 5-2 win. Wells threw 8 innings, giving up just three earned runs, and Frend went for his fourth round-tripper of the year in the loss. Davidson’s losing streak reached seven games on St. Patrick’s Day despite a four-run first inning when the Eagles, behind eight solid innings from their starting pitcher, held the ’Cats at bay for the remainder of the game. Freshman Andy Carter worked 7 and 1/3 innings on the hill, allowing just four runs while striking out six, but Georgia Southern’s designated hitter crushed a two-run homer in the top of the ninth as Davidson fell 8-6. The Wildcats will host the Spartans of UNC-Greensboro for a weekend home stand.
