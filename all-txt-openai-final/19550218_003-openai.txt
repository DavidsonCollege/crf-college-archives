**NON-SUBSIDIZATION PROGRAM FOR PRESENT TIME**

**FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 18, 1955**

**THE DAVIDSONIAN**

**SOUTHERN CONFERENCE SWIMMING MEET WILL PAGE THREE**

**Tom Scott New Athletic Director**

**Trustees Also Reaffirm Present Athletic Policy**

Last Wednesday, the Davidson College Board of Trustees met in their semi-annual meeting to discuss school policies and make new
appointments. The Board accepted Tom Scott, former basketball coach at North Carolina University, as the new athletic director, replacing Paul
Scott. Mr. Scott will resume his new duties in July.

The Trustees also reaffirmed the present athletic policy at Davidson. This means that the athletic scholarship fund will remain as
it is now and that plans will still continue for a non-subsidization program which will meet the approval of the
Trustees. The Davidsonian has been asked, in connection with this decision, to publish the following letter. It is an open
letter which is signed simply “The Davidson Football Team.”

“Today the resulting effects of inter-collegiate football on the participant seem to be on trial. The sports news are carrying
many articles pro and con in this crucial era of the gridiron sport. There are instances of cheating scandals, vandalism,
and even major crimes committed by football players in colleges and universities across the nation that could well be used
to substantiate the claim that football today has lost its character building and team work qualities. There is no need
of naming these instances specifically, for I am sure that each of us knows of the major scandals and many
others that we have heard or know about that did not reach the national spotlight. By the same token, many
others are claiming attributes that are just as absurd as are the extreme charges.

“However, it seems that we are overlooking one important fact. The boys that come to college and participate in football
have already formed many opinions, attitudes, and habits. It will be largely up to the coaches that they come in
contact with as to whether the bad qualities will be curbed and the good ones encouraged or vice-versa.

“We, of the football team of 1954-55, would like to express our appreciation to Coach Dole and his staff for
their policy which we feel makes football mean what it does to us today by coinciding with the other high
principles of Davidson College.”

**Cat Cagers Set For Home Stretch**

**BUNNY PERKINSON**

This week finds the Cats preparing for their last week of activity in regular season play, having only three more
games remaining. Monday night, February 21, the Cats will engage the Catawba quintet here at Davidson in the only meeting
of these two teams this season. On Friday and Saturday nights, Coach Miller’s improving club takes on Washington & Lee,
and V.M.I., in that order, to wind up the current campaign.

Going into last night's game against Furman, the Cats possessed a won-lost record of 7-10, and they could easily add
at least two more games to the win column before the final whistle blows at V.M.I. Saturday night. Last Thursday,
the Paladins from Furman invaded the campus and handed the Cats a 96 to 67 defeat. Despite the absence of
the fabulous Darrell Floyd, who did not make the trip because of sickness, Coach Lyles Alley’s boys displayed a high-scoring
attack, as four men hit the double figures in scoring. Pivot man Thomas was the leader with 25 points, profiting
by superior height to make numerous tip-ins and several beautiful hook shots. Hobby Cobb paced the Davidson attack by sinking
20 points, the remainder of the scoring honors being evenly divided between Weeks and Bennett, who bucketed 10 and 12,
respectively.

As the season nears a close, it is interesting to look back at the overall picture of the team presented
by its statistics. The totals given below are through the first V.M.I. game only, which was the sixteenth game.

**Kappa Sigs and Sigma Chis Still Pacing Greek Loop**

In the interfraternity basketball competition, the Sigma Chis and the Kappa Sigs are tied up and are still battling for
the league lead as the season reaches the halfway mark. Both teams have spotless records with five wins and no
losses. These two teams will clash in the early part of next week to determine which will fall from the
top spot. With the overall action starting into the sixth of eleven rounds, the Pikas, being the only team with
a single loss, are in second place. Tied for third place are the Phi Gams and the SPEs with 3
victories and 2 defeats. The SAEs are fourth with an even win-loss record, 3-3.

Due to many other school activities, only two nights of court action were held this week. On Tuesday, there were
three very close games and one high-scoring match. The Pi Kapps broke their losing streak by upsetting the SAEs, 43
to 39. Moreau with 17 points sparked the winners. While every member tallied, the SPEs scattered their scoring well as
they beat the KAs, 32-28. The KAs, who used no subs, were paced by Payne's 16 points. In a strictly
low-scoring game, the Pikas edged by the Phi Delts, 28 to 25. Reinhardt collected 8 points for the winners; Andrews
collected 9 for the losers. In the night’s most open game, the Sigma Chis won their fifth victory by outscoring
the Campus Club, 62 to 46.

On Wednesday night, the Kappa Sigs came out safely on top of a game in which both teams burnt up
the baskets. Three men broke 20 points for the winners. Feeney and Clark had 28 and 20, respectively, while the
ATO’s Page had 23. The final score was: the Kappa Sigs 75, the ATOs 51. The Phi Gams edged by
the Betas by the margin of three points, 32-29. Both Jones and Stauber had 13 points for the victors. Every
member of the SAE team scored as they beat the KAs, 45-28. The Pi Kapps hit their peak in defeating
theCampus Club, 74 to 28. Swain turned in a hot performance; he sank 28 of the winners’ points. The unofficial
standings are: (Continued On Page Four)

too, for full flavor enjoyment. Try a pack of Winstons! They taste good — like a cigarette should!

Wildcat Captains Discuss Season
By LEON HOWELL

With sporadic bursts of spring-like days visiting the Davidson College campus, the sports-minded students find their thoughts turning to the
baseball season. The interviews with the three leaders of the Cats aggregation produced various results.

Davidson Wrestlers Prepare for V.P.I. And Conference Meet

Coach Charlie Parker’s wrestlers wind up their regular season next week when the Grapplers move up to Blacksburg, Va., to
tangle with the Gobblers of V.P.I. The Davidson team will wrestle the Gobbler Craw on Saturday and will have a
five-day break before they return to Virginia for the Southern Conference Tournament at Lexington.

The Wildcat wrestlers lost two decisions during the past week. Last Saturday night, the Cats played host to The Citadel
and came out on the short end of a very close match. On Monday, the Davidson team journeyed to Lexington,
Va., only to lose, with Henry Griffin and Dave Regen pinning their men for Davidson's only points.

With Coach Clements involved in spring football drills, Co-Captain John Smith has been working the squad out during the past
few days. Although their work has been mainly with getting into shape and going through some fundamentals, he is of
the opinion that the outlook this year is the best since he has been here. A strong sophomore group will
add that very necessary element, competition, to the Davidson picture.

Another pitcher and co-captain, John “Ish” Bennett, is still tied up with basketball and hasn’t seen the squad work yet,
but he is of the opinion that greater defensive strength and pitching depth will make for the strongest team that
he has played on in his four years.

Captain Bill Rowland is more concerned at present with making the football shift from quarterback to halfback before the March
5 game with the alumni team. Although he was not available for quoting, he has urged everyone interested to come
out for the team. There will also be a J.V. squad for the surplus players this season.

Wildcat Splashers End Season's Card With W.&L. Today
By CHARLES McGIRT

The Davidson Wildcat swimmers, who have completed a busy weekend of three meets, held their last outing before the Southern
Conference Championship Meet today at 3:30 here in Johnston Gym. The foe was Washington and Lee.

Last week the Cats hit the road for a Friday tangle with Clemson, met Emory there Saturday, and took on
VPI here Monday. At Clemson, a new record in the breaststroke was set. Davidson's boy, John Edwards, made the 200-yard
swim with the time of 2:44.6. This broke the Wildcat varsity record as well as the Clemson pool record. Clemson's
top-notch 400-yard relay team edged out the Davidson three and pulled a 46-38 victory over the visitors. At Emory, the
fast 400-yard relay team of Davidson, which lost by a very little to Clemson, broke their school record. Those in
the relay were Rivers, Query, Carrell and Speir. At this meet, the lads from North Carolina again won in a
close contest. In the Monday VPI contest, VPI emerged victorious 59-25. Last year, the Southern Conference champions were VPI. The
championship meet will be held in Davidson this year, February 24-26. This promises to be a good, close meet among
many of the schools in this section. VPI will be trying hard to keep the last year’s title, but there
will be plenty of competition.
