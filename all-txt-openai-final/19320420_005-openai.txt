Annual Initiation Held For Delta Phi Alpha
Five New Members Are Taken Into Honorary German Fraternity

On Thursday evening, April 14, Delta Phi Alpha, honorary German fraternity, was the guest of Dr. and Mrs. G. R.
Vowles at their home for an exceedingly enjoyable "Musikalischer Abend." The program consisted of well-known German songs and ballads which
were sung in German by members of the society, being accompanied at the piano by Mrs. Vowles. This was followed
by phonograph records of selections from German operas which were sung by famous artists.

At the meeting which followed the musical program, the following new members were initiated: W. B. Corbin, F. H. Scott,
W. M. Thompson, W. T. Thompson, and J. W. White. Following their initiation, the neophytes presented a dramatization of the
Elizabethan Period, of a short story, "Der fahrende Schüler in Paradies," by Hans Sachs, the famous German poet and author.
The sketch was presented in German and the actors were Corbin, Scott, and W. M. Thompson. White was the official
prompter and W. T. Thompson gave a short summary of the life and works of Sachs. The entire sketch was
well done and was greatly enjoyed by everyone present.

Mrs. Vowles was elected an honorary member of the society and the following officers were elected for the coming year:
President, P. F. Brown; vice-president, C. M. Wildman; secretary-treasurer, F. H. Scott.
