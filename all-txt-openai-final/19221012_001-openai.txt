**CHAUTAUQUA ENTERTAINERS MAKE ANNUAL APPEARANCE**  
**Students and Townspeople Furnished Educational Entertainment**

The Redpath Chautauqua opened its local three-day program Friday afternoon, in the special tent provided on the vacant lot in front of the post office. The Chautauqua was brought to Davidson largely through the influence of Dr. H. B. Arbuckle, chairman of the local committee.

**FRIDAY AFTERNOON**

Everyone, both young and old, who was at the opening performance was delightfully pleased with the presentations. From the beginning to the ending of the performance, the audience eagerly awaited the development of the program. The performance began with a folk dance by 12 small girls of Davidson, under the direction of the children’s worker, dressed in red, white, and blue dresses. They carried out a patriotic program, Uncle Sam, Miss Columbia, and Liberty were the central figures.

The Clifford Collins Company rendered a splendid musical program. In this company are two exceptionally gifted musicians. Their musical program and the characterization of the modern hick were met with enthusiasm. The Collins Company, composed of Mr. Clifford Collins and his wife, perform under the name of the Collins Dual.

Following the program presented by these capable artists, Milburn, the magician, proved himself to be a sleight-of-hand artist of no mean ability. The manner in which he made the coins and the handkerchiefs vanish, and his Spirit Box are still puzzling those who watched him perform his marvels. His greatest card, however, was the writing on the slate which was not touched by human hands during the whole operation. A fitting climax was added to the program in the lecture—Making Your Dreams Come True—by Dr. W. T. S.

**THE WILDCAT SCREAMS**

Some folks just hang onto a dollar bill so hard that it makes a permanent wave in George Washington's hair.

**DAVIDSON STUDENT BODY BREAKS INTO MOVIELAND.**

Students of Davidson will soon see themselves as others see them. The moving pictures of the Wildcats on parade, taken in Charlotte during the Exposition by the Pathe News Company, is being circulated over the country and will be seen at Davidson in the next few weeks, it is announced. The actions of the college men were recorded on numerous occasions during Davidson Day and interest is being manifested in its local appearance.

**DAVIDSON CAMPAIGN MEETS WITH ENCOURAGING SUCCESS**

**Finances for Rebuilding Chambers Being Pledged Rapidly**

In an interview with Mr. Malcolm Lockhart, director of the Davidson College campaign, he seemed very much pleased with the outlook and progress the campaign is making, and has already made. A characteristic remark of Mr. Lockhart was: “The spirit of the campaign is unusually fine.” By October 15, subscriptions amounting to $100,000 will be in hand, it is expected. The campaign has been practically completed in the Fayetteville and Concord Presbyteries with remarkable results. Rally meetings have been held in Orange Presbytery preparatory to setting up the campaign there. Campaigns for the other four Presbyteries will be started soon with a period of two weeks between each. The Charlotte campaign for $100,000 will be carried on the week of November 6-18. The college campaign will begin at an early date. Mr. Lockhart is delighted with the Wildcat spirit and after going through Georgia Tech, the University of Georgia, and Agnes Scott, he is especially optimistic. A feature of the campaign has been the part taken by the college quartette. It has been a great help in the rally meetings. Last Sunday the quartette was in Greensboro and sang at a number of meetings. It has been of much service to the campaigners.

D. Benjamin Franklin, philosopher-printer, once said that there were only two things in this life that human beings could not get away from. They are death and taxes.

While Red Laird Stars on Offense, His Long Punts Featuring—Tech Fails at Two Attempted Drop Kicks — Wet Field Shows Up Game Considerably.

Battling all the way in a sea of mud, Coach Grey’s scrapping Wildcats held the powerful Golden Tornado to a 19-point margin on Grant Field last Saturday afternoon. The Red and Black warriors took the field with the grim determination to stay in there and fight to the last whistle, and when the timekeeper ended the game the Presbyterian fighters had held the vaunted Jackets to the lowest score since 1916. The game looked like the battles of five years ago when Coach Grey himself was in the game matching the Techmen blow for blow. Last year’s score is but a memory, for the fighting Wildcats have come back and the Davidson supporters in Atlanta have seen a worthy successor to the teams which held the Tornado so well in previous seasons. The Davidson team was handicapped in its offensive work by the sogginess of the field which made forward passing aPractical the execution of sweeping end runs and other open plays. The Wildcats were unable to gain through the line. Captain Spratt and Red Laird were the only backs to gain at all. Red Laird, playing in his hometown, featured the Davidson offensive. He was in on every play and his punting pulled the Wildcats out of many tight holes. He averaged close to 40 yards on his punts. Spratt Moore played his usual game as safety man. Time after time he got his man when a miss meant an open field. Too much credit cannot be given to the line which held so well. Sam Summers, at guard, bore the brunt of two plays on the one-yard line which were stopped without gain. The Tornado opened up with a rush, scoring two touchdowns in the first period. The Wildcats slowed them up in the second period and the Jackets were only able to cross the line once. In the final half, the Davidson team gave the Jackets the tussle of their lives. The ball was in Davidson territory the whole time but the Jackets were forced to punt three times and twice the ball went to Davidson on the 20-yard line after drop kicks failed. The crisis of the game came when in the fourth quarter a forward pass on (Continued on Page Two) impossibility and hindered regularly, lives.

BRADFORD AND McLEOD WIN IN LAST ELECTION

At the meeting of the Athletic Association held Monday morning, October 3rd, an election was held to fill the vacancies of cheerleader and assistant football manager. The candidates for cheerleader were A. V. Gibson and R. L. McLeod, the latter being elected by a small majority. To fill the vacancy left by the resignation of Warren Cox as assistant football manager, W. Z. Bradford was elected over his opposing candidate, D. J. Chipman.

PLAY BY PLAY DETAILS OF GAME SECURED BY STUDENTS

Local Supporters See Game by Wire Service

As the Wildcats plunged into battle on Grant Field Saturday afternoon, over half the Davidson College student body assembled around a large blackboard nailed to the east side of the Davidson depot. The street was filled with the enthusiastic mob surging to and fro in hopeful anticipation of the first kick-off. Through eyes of wire, they were to watch the progress of the game 500 miles away. A great silence fell on them as Galloway rose on the express wagon with the first dispatch. Tech was headed toward the Davidson goal. Then dispatches poured in. As fast as telegrams were sent, Mauze diagramed each play. The blackboard developed into a saw-tooth diagram of end runs and drives. Occasionally Tech was thrown for a loss and the people of Davidson were disturbed by the shout that rent the air. More frequently, however, the steady gains by Tech occasioned sighs and groans, wrung from the lips of the far-away spectators. One, two, three touchdowns sped over the wires and the ardor of the crowd was dampened. But touchdowns require time and before a fourth could be made the first half was ended. As in the grandstand, speculation, eats, and cold drinks were in order and the assembly dispersed to assemble again at the beginning of the last half. Slowly and steadily Tech advanced toward the Wildcats’ goal. In the shadow of their goal post, the Wildcats held them for downs. The crowd (Continued on Page Four)

CHARLOTTE JOURNALIST SPEAKER AT SERMON

Address by Julian Miller Feature at Sunday Vesper Service

Most impressive and uplifting was the Y. M. C. A. service held in Shearer Hall Sunday evening. W. A. Gamble presided over the meeting, while Buck Currie led the singing. Purdy officiated at the piano, with R. G. White accompanying on the violin. The entire gathering joined heartily in the singing of "When the Roll Is Called Up Yonder," "Have Thine Own Way, Lord," and other hymns, after which J. L. McLean and Gamble led in prayer. Gamble introduced Mr. Julian Miller, State News Editor of The Charlotte News, who was the speaker of the evening. In his opening remarks, Mr. Miller assured his hearers of the pleasure of being in Davidson on such an occasion. The interest manifested by the students during his address assured the speaker that his address was highly appreciated. “Impressions are made in our early lives,” said Mr. Miller, “that will never die.” He spoke of his college days, and of one sentence that made a lasting impression on him. This sentence (Continued on Page Five)
