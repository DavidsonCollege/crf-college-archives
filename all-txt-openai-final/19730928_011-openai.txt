**Flickerball Teams Vie**

By CAPTAIN BUCKY

The flickerball season moved into gear last week and the teams are starting to show who is good and who
is rotten. As usual, the rotten teams vastly outnumber the good squads. Last Wednesday saw four teams start on their
way to winning their division.

A solid PAX squad opened their year by beating upon the hand-me-down SAE No. 2. A No. 2 behind a
fraternity team’s name usually stands for success for the opponent, unless the confrontation involves a POT team. SAE No. 1,
meanwhile, showed why there is an SAE No. 2 team as they pounced on a not-too-bad PGO bunch by a
whopping 90-6 score. Back from Germany, veteran Peyton Prospere led the Emanon rout. SAE No. 1 showed talent and depth
at every position, and led by their own inimitable Calvin Allen, trounced the hapless ATO’s 67-13 in a game that
just cannot go by as being overmatched. The ATOs can find solace only in the fact that they did not
choke another close one. Where are you now, Steve Canterbury? SAE No. 1 is one of the top teams around,
however.

To round out Wednesday’s action, the Staten Island Fairies nabbed a close forfeit win over the shorthanded Tennis Bums. “The
Bums will be tough if they can get their players together,” says player-coach Jeff (Golden Wheels) Frank.

**Sailors Expand Team, Initiates Learn Ropes**

In conjunction with the Physical Education directors, the sailing team has expanded its ranks to approximately 50 prospective sailors. This
program will provide an opportunity for the members of the team to teach what they know to the new people
in a practical way. In this manner, everyone learns from experience and from making their own mistakes and may progress
at their own rate. This approach to their education gives the sailor freedom and in turn a great enthusiasm towards
what he is doing.

Sailing is not a sport confined to the fall and spring terms. Galesville, Md. was the site this past August
of the Jet Nationals. This competition, held yearly and in a different location each year, serves as a challenge to
the most proficient skippers in the country. Daryl Douglas proved to be one of the craftiest, most skilled, and most
aggressive of all 104 sailors as he walked away with a first-place trophy in one of the five races. Placing
consistently high, Douglas came out eighth at the end of the last day of races.

Racing this fall looks equally as promising. There has been a great deal of skill shown by the new P.E.
prospects. Freshman Chris Mangelsdorf sailed at Christopher-Newport this past weekend with Dave Francis, a skipper from last year’s team, in
one of the term’s first SAISA regattas. Hervey Froehlich and Gary Lane crewed for Mangelsdorf and Francis. Davidson placed fourth
out of five teams. Francis placed second in the A Division and Mangelsdorf fourth in B.

Phone 892-0569Power, rare in a complex sport such as flickerball, was unleashed. C-I, led by shifty Walter Crouch, dealt the
experienced SPE’s a crushing blow, scoring late in the game to win 12-7. Here’s a team that should get better
game by game. The PKA’s flexed their muscles a little as Jim Boyd and Lester Abberger led a potent offense
to a 30-18 triumph over a young C-IV team. Unfortunately for the PKA’s, they lack the depth this year to
beat the big teams. The oddball crew of Miles Glorius was up just enough to get past R-I 19-17 in
the closest game of the day. The game even had a safety for the MG’s as their defense led the
way.

After insulting the N. Main Gozinyas last week, C.A. must apologize—a little anyways. They can play alright, I guess. With
beer awaiting each unit on the sidelines, the Goz. found it in themselves to soundly thrash C-III 47-0. They have
much class to go with their little talent. Last Monday saw R-I decline to show up and get pummeled by
the jock-full Delts. Fag Tweedy and Tommy Curtis will lead this powerhouse to the championship, yet again. A lot more
teams would be better off by watching “Star Trek” instead of getting kicked in by the Delts.

Meanwhile, in an intra-freshman battle, the male chauvinist pigs, R-III, handed out a 33-0 lashing to the rather inept gathering
of people titled the Wimpettes Plus. Do not let the “Plus” mislead you folks. Other freshman games that day saw
S-IV, behind Marvin Lehr, Jerry Stallworth, and Billy McClean, build up an early lead and coast to a 24-19 victory
over cross-lawn rivals C-IV. These guys could cause trouble for most teams, but inexperience is the key. C-I showed they
were no fluke as they jumped all over the Altoona Aardvarks 28-0. The AAs should stick to building banners as
all their class is in their name.

Tuesday saw a real good blood battle between the SPE’s and PAX. In sudden death, the PAX people made 25
yards in 4 downs while the SPE’s could only get 10 in their allotted time. A real fine game, and
a big win for PAX. The Staten Island Fairies, trying to revamp new faces into their lineup, had some of
the PKA’s before and George Loy showed the way to a 45-21 win.

So after a week of flickerball, it looks like this: League 1 has North Main Gozinyas at 1-0 along with
powerful Em No. 1 also at 1-0. League 2 shows C-I and PAX both tied at 2-0 and this could
be a real scramble. League 3 has the Fairies at 2-0 with S-IV just behind at 1-0. League 4 with
SAEs and R-3 both at 1-0. League 5 shows Miles Glorius at 2-0 while the slumbering Delts await a team
to play at 1-0.
