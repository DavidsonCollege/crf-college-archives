Usually the only thing that can keep his little brother from court parties is probation. He doesn't want to go
to any parties, he's not like that.

Look, I know my brother. Have you asked him?

I don't understand this, Eddie.

Do I have to prove this to you?

Hey, SERGIE!

Are you kidding?

The guy is Freddieâ€™s brother. He's still in high school, man.

At Freddie's Room:
He's gone. I guess he went back to the room.

MEANWHILE @ PATTERSON COURT:
Dude! Who is that guy?

Neat, captain.

What do you mean you're Freddie's brother?! No way! This is too much.

I told him to go down to the courts.

And how does he get so many girls to hang all over him?
