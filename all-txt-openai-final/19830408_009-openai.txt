**In Baseball Cats Give U.S.C. a Run for their Money**

By BOBBY BARNES

The Davidson baseball team came within two feet and two debatable calls of pulling off the biggest upset in college sports since, well, since N.C. State beat Houston. The 18th ranked University of South Carolina pulled out a 9-6 victory over a scrappy Wildcat team Wednesday night in Columbia before some 300 fans.

The Cats wasted no time convincing the Gamecocks that they came to play as catcher Philip Gordon chased home John Mahoney with a first-inning home run to left. U.S.C. battled back with a pair of runs in the bottom half of the inning to tie the game. They then took the lead with a run in the third only to fall behind as David Emery drilled a two-run single to put the Cats ahead 4-3. The see-saw continued with U.S.C. tying the score in the fourth and going ahead in the fifth.

The Cats refused to die. They threatened in the sixth to chase the starting pitcher and then came up with a pair of runs in the seventh off South Carolina’s ace reliever to knot the score. Gamecock third baseman John Sullivan put his team ahead for good with a seventh inning homer that just cleared a short centerfield fence. Scott Weaver (1-3) took the loss despite pitching his best game of the season. Seniors Philip Gordon and David Emery led the Cats — each with two hits and two RBIs in four at bats.

Davidson opened the 1983 conference schedule with a pair of losses to league-leading East Tennessee State. In the opener, the Buccaneers topped the Wildcats 14-1. ETSU broke open a close game with six runs in a wild fifth inning that featured the ejection of Coach George Greer and starting pitcher Bob Barnes. Much of the controversy which sparked the debate centered around a swing that everyone saw except the two umpires (how both of them could miss something so obvious is still a mystery).

The Bucs continued to pound out hits off reliever Doug Wiley while the Cats could offer no threat at the plate. Scott Weaver, leading the team in hitting, drove in the only run with a fourth inning single. ETSU took the second game 11-3 to complete the sweep. Again, the game was close until the Bucs scored six times in the final frame. Back-to-back home runs to lead off the inning sent starter Matt Walker (2-2) to the showers; four more runs marked the end to a string of successful relief performances by Ed Whitesides. In all, the visitors hit seven round-trippers.

The Cats proved more aggressive at the plate, collecting ten hits — half coming from the last two hitters in the lineup, Al Baldwin and Chip Knox. Unfortunately, they managed to strand eleven runners. Characteristic of the day for the Cats was in the second inning when Davidson bunched three singles together with one out, but came up empty on the scoreboard. Baldwin had three hits, including a double, and Knox and Keith Helfant each had two.

The Cats travel to Charleston Monday to play conference power The Citadel. The Bulldogs finished second to South Carolina in the Atlantic Regionals in last year’s NCAA tournament. Barnes and Walker will take the mound for Davidson.

**DC Tennis Defeats Carolina**

By TIM MCGAUGHEY

Davidson’s Men’s Tennis team (8-6) posted a rain-delayed victory over Western Carolina yesterday. The wet weather postponed the final four matches, yet before the rains set in, Davidson’s top five singles won five of nine matches scheduled to assure the rain-shortened victory. Tennis Coach Jeff Frank complained that the weather had “wrecked the team’s practice and play schedule” all season. Earlier this week the Cats postponed their match...against Johnson C. Smith University due to rain. Despite such problems, Frank feels the team "is playing as well as it has all season." The Cats go against conference opponents Marshall and VMI this weekend, and good play will be particularly important. These teams are in Davidson to play several matches in one weekend, thus saving time and money. Davidson needs to establish momentum going into the tough final weeks of the season when they face strong UT-C and Furman teams.

From the Locker Room: The Athletic Complex
By STEVE SOUD

A debate will rage among Davidson folk for years to come: it will concern the proposed athletic complex. Last week’s treatment of the subject in The Davidsonian was unfair; I should like to present a more encompassing view.

Present demands on Johnston Gym eclipse its capacity. It was built for a sub-1000 member all-male student body. Its locker facilities are barely adequate. Office space is cramped. As many as six varsity teams, not to mention intramurals and physical education, compete for gym space in the winter. Quarters were so cramped that intramural games were nearly forced to Saturdays. Anyone who has tried to play pickup basketball on a winter weekday knows how limited gym space really is. Consequently, Davidson needs a new athletic complex.

The preeminent reason for a new gym and arena is the space dilemma. If men’s and women’s varsity basketball had a new practice area, it would open about six hours a day. Secondary uses for the gym would have far greater flexibility. As it is now, there is little open time in the gym. Davidson has committed itself to a strong, Division I basketball program, and this goal cannot be realized without a new facility. The basketball program cannot recruit to its greatest potential with 2600-seat Johnston Gym. When Davidson competes with Richmond for a player, Richmond has a head start because of their new arena. Most schools in the Southern Conference (Marshall, VMI, UT-Chattanooga, East Tennessee, Western Carolina) have either completed new athletic complexes or have plans to do so. It is not a matter of “keeping up with the Joneses.” It is a matter of surviving in the fast-paced world of college basketball. If Davidson is serious about a strong basketball program, it must have something more than rickety, cramped Johnston Gym.

Building a new complex comparable to others does not imply a “Xanadu” nor does it imply some overwhelming commitment to athletics. The plans for the building are neither for a Xanadu nor for a “Spartan” building. To build a no-frill complex requires an enormous monetary commitment. Davidson would cheat itself to put $14 million into a complex and not add a few frills at relatively little extra cost. The immense expenditure does not imply a de-emphasis of academics. Just because the College spent $3.6 million on the Commons does not mean we are to become nationally famous for eating! Notre Dame, Stanford, Michigan, UNC, and UVA are all known for excellence in athletics and academics. A new athletic complex can only enhance Davidson’s reputation.

Davidson is little known outside the Carolinas and Georgia; when people know its name, it is most often because of the basketball program. If the basketball program returns to prominence, it will not only pay for itself (UT-Chattanooga made over $100,000 for their one NCAA tournament game), but it will also bring more applicants, from whom better students may be chosen. It is Davidson's new and revamped facilities — the library, the Commons, the Union, the chemistry building — which attract quality students. Better facilities will bring better students. If Davidson is to become the forward-looking institution it claims to be, it must build the new athletic complex.
