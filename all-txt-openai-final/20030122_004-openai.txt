**Senior housing, from page 1**

Students would then go to the West Hall conference room, just as with residence hall lottery, and line up according to the group’s lottery number. Unlike residence hall lottery, Martin Court lottery would take place on Saturday, Mar. 27. By RLO’s calculation, the process would take at least five hours. There would be no preference given to senior-only groups, and clustering would not be available.

**Having a say**

RLO is actively seeking student input in the decision, and students at last night’s meeting were active in providing it. Of around 50 rising seniors attending, a show of hands indicated concerns, however, remain. Issues for senior-only groups and losing the option of clustering were raised as problems with Process B, while increased student autonomy in choosing specific apartments and neighbors were cited as advantages. Ultimately, RLO will decide which process will be used this year. Students with an opinion on the matter, particularly the most immediately affected rising seniors, are encouraged to email Marsicano. A decision will likely be made sometime next week.

Regardless of the process implemented, applications for five-person apartments will be due at noon on Mar. 18, and applications for four-person apartments will be due at noon on Mar. 25. Lottery numbers should be posted on Feb. 17.

...ship with Mike Jones, a booking agent with More Music who is also a personal friend of Matthews’ manager. Jones helped bring John Mayer to Davidson in September. Second, the school has a good reputation as a concert venue. Matthews has played to 50,000 fans at huge football stadiums, but on this tour, he’s looking to get up close and personal—and Belk Arena, which seats 4,700 for concerts, will allow exactly that.

“This tour is designed to be a small show. It’s the nature of an acoustic tour,” said Bannerman. “The more intimate, the better.” And lastly, Davidson’s offer was...As strong as any of its competitors. “They guided us on how to make the offer,” said Bannerman of More Music. “It’s like having inside information. We had an inside track because we have a relationship with this middle agent. And we also made a very smart business offer to Dave Matthews. All of that combined makes it fall into place.”

Ticket Details

The show, scheduled for Tuesday, March 25 at around 9 p.m., will last three hours and is expected to sell out almost immediately. Bannerman said she received more than 50 emails and phone calls asking for ticket information within days of the show’s announcement. Matthews will likely arrive in Davidson that afternoon and leave after the show. He is not expected to make any other appearances during the stop.

Students, staff, and faculty will get the first crack at the best seats at 10 a.m. on Thursday, Feb. 6, when a reserved block of 1,500 tickets go on sale for $39.50 in the Union. Long lines are expected, and the sale may last well into the afternoon. Bannerman said she wouldn’t be surprised if some students camped out in the Union the night before to get the very best seats. “I’m certainly not encouraging that, but I am anticipating that it’s a possibility,” she said. “It’s first-come, first-serve, so the sooner you’re here, the better.” She pointed out that Belk Arena’s sight lines will allow everyone to get a good view of the stage. “In all honesty, there’s not a bad seat, even if you’re up in the bleachers. (But) if you want to be right up front, you’ve got to get in line,” she said.

Students who have class that morning are encouraged to give their CatCards to friends who can purchase tickets for each CatCard they have. “We strongly discourage skipping class,” she said. “In order to back that up, we’re saying send a friend with your CatCard and let them do it for you.”

Two days later, the general public can purchase tickets at MusicToday.com and through the Union Ticket Office. “I wouldn’t be surprised if the public tickets are gone the day of the sale,” said Bannerman.

Oddly enough, Matthews’ tour will also make stops at Appalachian State’s Holmes Center, as well as Lawrence Joel Memorial Coliseum in Winston-Salem. “I was surprised that he’s doing three in North Carolina,” said Bannerman. Other schools on the tour include Rhode Island, Old Dominion, Miami (Ohio), Purdue, and Carthage College.
