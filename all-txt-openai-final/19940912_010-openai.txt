**Clear and Present Danger: Too Much Story, Too Little Time**
By James Berry

Upon first hearing that another of Tom Clancy’s techno-thrillers was destined for the screen, my heart leapt from my chest.
Both of his previous efforts (The Hunt For Red October, Patriot Games) had proven themselves ideal for the theater while
retaining a significant amount of detail from the novels. In my experience, it is rare for a movie to achieve
this; most end up as grave disappointments.

Even more exciting for me was the fact that Harrison Ford would again take on the role of the idealistic
Jack Ryan. It is his successful portrayal of that character that made Patriot Games an emotional rollercoaster on top of
its action-filled plot.

In Clear and Present Danger, the murder of a man with close connections to the White House by a Colombian
drug lord leads to illegal U.S. intervention amidst political intrigue. Jack Ryan is thrown into the mess when his boss,
Jim Greer (James Earl Jones), falls prey to cancer and Jack must take his place as Director of the CIA.

Unlike the first two films, Clear and Present Danger relies heavily on the interworkings of the White House, including all
that goes on behind closed doors. This approach is probably more realistic but less exciting than the scene—

Across the Atlantic, a new, life-changing experience awaited a group of ten American students in the western African nation of
Ghana last semester. Among the eager, excited, and curious travelers was current Davidson senior Jennifer Tracy.

After the long flight, Tracy was greeted by the first of her two host families in Accra, Ghana’s capital city.
Tracy, an English major at Davidson, decided to travel to Ghana on an arts program through the School for International
Training after leafing through several options, including a semester abroad in Kenya.

As an American student in a foreign country, Tracy had a myriad of obstacles to overcome besides language barriers and
culture shock. She took drumming lessons, studied literature, and received instruction in traditional African dance at the University of Legon.
Although all teaching was done in English, Ghana’s official language, Tracy managed to learn Twi, one of Ghana’s 45 languages
and dialects.

One of the most prominent differences Tracy noticed while abroad was the role of women in Ghanaian society. The major
disparities between American and Ghanaian culture that most affected Tracy were the poverty that plagues the nation and the perception
of women as subordinate. Women work and earn money outside the home; they labor most often in the markets, selling
cloth, vegetables, fish, and other staple items. Though the cities are more westernized than the rest of the country, polygamy
is still a common practice in rural areas of Ghana. Some traditional tribes also perform female circumcision.

Tracy noted that as a Western woman, she was treated with more respect than a Ghanaian woman due to her
white complexion. She received positive attention, and people extended their warmest hospitality to her. Her Ghanaian families served her the
largest portion of food and offered the best bed in the house.

“The Ghanaian conception [of color] is that white is better than black,” Tracy said. She added that as a former
British colony, Ghana has practically been taught that it is “inferior and uncivilized” in comparison to more developed countries, such
as the United States and Great Britain.

When Tracy had the opportunity to relax and have fun, she said she most enjoyed spending free time with her
host families. Thus, they grew very close and remain in contact.Long distances in vans called “trotros” was another interesting venture
in Ghanaian public transportation. Her host sister often took her to dance clubs in Accra. During the last month of
Tracy’s experience abroad, she embarked on her independent study. She chose the topic of traditional Western African religion. Through her
research, Tracy met with university professors and eventually traveled to obscure Ghanaian villages, where she learned firsthand about traditional African
religious practices. After spending sufficient time in Ghana, Tracy admitted, “I learned about my own close-mindedness. My whole perspective changed,
and I learned to appreciate things more.” She learned about the Afrikania Mission, a new religion initiated in Nigeria which
reflects many ancient religions of Africa. After researching the Afrikania Mission in depth, she decided to gain some more firsthand
experiences in the field of traditional religion. Tracy traveled to a remote village where she was given informative instruction by
the high chief and priest of the village. The priest taught her about the practices of female circumcision, polygamy, and
“troksi,” religious practices that are considered demeaning toward women in Western cultures. Troksi takes place when a young female around
the age of eight is taken from her family and sent to the priest of the village for atonement.

Awareness Art Ensemble opens live Monday

Awareness Art Ensemble played in the 900 Room last Monday night.

By Rachel Newcomb

It started out like many nights in the 900 Room. The room slowly filled with people, the room darkened, and
a musical act took the stage. Only this time something was different. Usually, students applaud politely from their chairs, looking
like spectators at a play. But on Monday, September 5, in the 900 Room, a whole crowd of students got
out of their chairs and danced to the mellow rhythms of reggae act Awareness Art Ensemble. Even those still sitting
seemed to be enjoying themselves immensely. As the first performance in the Union-sponsored Live Monday series, Awareness Art Ensemble was
a fine choice to open up the school year. Local to Richmond, Virginia, the reggae band was formed by lead
singer and visual artist Olamina about 13 years ago as a poetry, drum, and dance group. They have opened for
such acts as the Wailers, Third World, Taj Mahal, and Burning Spear. While their music is most definitely reggae, it
also reveals the influences of R & B and jazz. The lyrics are poetic and quite frequently political, and the
band members are committed to the Jamaican religion of Rastafari. In an interview with the Richmond News Leader in 1991,
Olamina said, “To us reggae is more of the people. It’s music for the downtrodden and the oppressed, and they
still need a voice in the world.” As a collective unit, the band seemed very cohesive. Tall and sinewy, with
hollow cheekbones and long dreadlocks, lead singer Olamina commanded the stage with a hauntingly memorable stage presence. The two keyboardists,
Wali Bryant and Ojuleba, both had very distinct sounds—Ojuleba tending more toward space-age noises while Bryant backed guitarist Vinnie Visions
with complementary melodies. In the back, drummer Joe Corbin pulled the band together with tight, steady rhythms, with skillful musician
Chuck X on the bass. The band specializes in traditional, high-energy reggae, and their sound is strident yet accessible. I
have never before seen so many people in the 900 Room this visibly excited about music. Whit Higgins is partly
to blame for this. As the latest to hold the position of Intimate Performance Committee chair, he has tried to
line up acts for this semester that will appeal to a wide range of the campus population. Calling his shows
“Live Mondays,” Higgins has moved away from the blues emphasis to an emphasis on variety. He still plans to have
a blues act later in the semester. In October, hopefully, he will bring an acoustic guitarist to campus.
