---

We went to the store with mother.

Just inside the doors, with fish bowls on their heads—

my store of the store.

And I gazed at them all.

With a dime in his eye—
turn his nose—

and your prize.

I,

6,

was dazzled

by all I saw.

Treasures of every kind:

jewels from Africa, Arabia, and all,
a ruby ring of the king of old England,

black spiders, purple mice, and green scorpions
who, once outside,

come alive at night

and scutter across—

the small girl with dots for eyes—
yes, she was the smallest girl in the world,

trapped
in her transparent sphere,

and only I could set her
free.

Real, live knives and guns

to fight off her mean old miserly uncle
who put her there and charges

folks a fee

to see her...

My small sweaty hands

groped in the bottom

of my pockets,

and they played

with the lint they found there,

rolling it into balls between thumb and pointer.

Then,

elated,

I,

6,

pulled out a coin
and looked at it shine:

a dime.

Mimi said save money,

but

a dime—
that’s just 2 nickels,
that’s just 10 pennies.

A treasure is so much more.

I decided,

filled his eye,
turned his nose,

nothing.
I kicked it.
I jabbed it.

I reached for a second chance

and found only
fuzz balls.
