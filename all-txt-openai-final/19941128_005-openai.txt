Dean Rusk Student Advisory Committee charter approved

By Susan Warren

On Wednesday night the SGA approved the charter for the Dean Rusk Student Advisory Committee. With a charter, the Dean Rusk Committee will receive “official recognition,” according to Appropriations Committee member Chad Lloyd.

The Dean Rusk Program plans lecture series, foreign films, study breaks, and other activities to encourage international awareness on campus. The committee wanted a charter because, in addition to the recognition, the charter will allow the group to petition for funds from the activities council.

Kelly Dixson, Vice Chairman of the committee, speaks about the Dean Rusk Program: “It’s really open to anything the student wants to do.”

The charter states that its purpose is “to advise the administration of the Dean Rusk Program on how best to serve international interest on campus as well as to take an active role in forwarding international awareness.”

leave the Commons open later on days when the team practiced late so that they would have more options than merely sandwiches and chips.

Also, the football team would get to the Commons near the end of dinner when some offerings had run thin. As Metzler says, “I’ve responded to those needs. We’ve cooked something to satisfy those needs.”

My field trip to the Commons confirmed what Wood says about the Commons and its staff: “It’s a process, and we take it very seriously.”

No one can say that the Commons is perfect. But no one can say that Vail Commons is not willing to listen and to respond. It was a very successful field trip indeed.
