**Davidson Downed By Charlotte**

**By Matt Garfield, Managing Editor**

CHARLOTTE—Two things you can count on when Davidson and Charlotte renew their cross-county rivalry: raucous fans and lots of three-point shooting. On Nov. 16 at Halton Arena, most of both belonged to the 49ers. Charlotte’s 65-51 win gave it the Hornets’ Nest Trophy for the sixth straight year and closely resembled last season’s 69-53 victory in Belk Arena on Dec. 9.

Just like last year, the arena was filled nearly to capacity with 8,011 noisy spectators, including about 400 Davidson students who took four charter buses and the Vamanos Van to the game. Just like last year, both teams played aggressively, diving for loose balls and contesting every shot. And just like last year, Jobey Thomas made the difference. The senior guard scored a game-high 18 points, but it wasn’t easy. With Peter Anderer shadowing him early, Thomas missed six of his first nine shots. As the game went on, Thomas heated up, keying an 11-0 second-half spurt that put the Wildcats away for good.

“I was thrilled with how hard we played,” said Bob McKillop. “We just don’t have enough firepower if we don’t cross every T and dot every I. There’s just so little margin for error.”

**Sharpshooting Anderer Steps Up**

In the final seconds of the biggest game of his life, against one of the most storied teams in college basketball, with 14,000 fans rooting against him, Peter Anderer wasn’t the least bit nervous. With his team up 56-54 over North Carolina with 10 seconds left, Anderer calmly sank two free throws to clinch the most memorable victory in recent Davidson history. The 6-1 guard from Manhattan scored a game-high 18 points, hitting four of his seven three-point shots and keeping momentum on the Wildcats’ side right down to the final buzzer.

Three games into the season, Anderer has emerged as one of the top playmakers on the Wildcats’ roster, leading the team with 13.3 points per game. What makes it all so surprising is that three years ago, he couldn’t find Davidson on a map. He thought his playing days would end after he graduated from Regis High School in Manhattan. He had already submitted a deposit to Columbia University, where his father teaches Japanese literature and film, because no college coaches had shown interest.

But in March of his senior year, Anderer caught the eye of then-Hofstra assistant Tom Pecora. Hofstra had already given out all its scholarships for the year, but Pecora figured Anderer was good enough to play somewhere. So he called his friend Bob McKillop, a Hofstra graduate, to give him a heads-up on the sharpshooter from Manhattan. McKillop and Anderer spoke on the phone a few days later, shortly before assistant coach Matt Matheny stopped by Regis to see Anderer play his second-favorite sport, volleyball. After the game, Matheny and Anderer found a gym and Peter put on a shooting display that would ultimately bring him to Davidson.

“I’ll be honest,” Anderer recalls, “I don’t think I’ve ever shot better than I did in that gym that day.”

He wasn’t given a scholarship until after his first year, which turned out to be a challenge. “Coach McKillop challenged him after his first year here as a walk-on,” said assistant coach Jason Zimmerman. “One of those things was getting stronger, getting tougher and more controlled. Peter plays with a tremendous intensity, and sometimes that means he goes too fast, too hard on offense.”

Now in his third year, Anderer has evolved into a well-rounded two-guard with deadly three-point range. Fans have taken notice of his play, and the accolades are starting to pour in. In the days after the North Carolina victory, Anderer received more than...30 e-mails from fans and friends congratulating him on a great game. Observers of Davidson basketball are beginning to realize what Zimmerman has already learned. “Every time he steps on the court, you know what you’re gonna get from him,” Zimmerman said. “Everything he’s got.”

Team: Patriot League

The history: Beat Davidson 67-60 in Annapolis in 1998.

So far: The Mids lost six seniors, including four starters, from last year’s team, so it’s not surprising they lost to Rice and Southern Methodist to open the season. The Mids beat Air Force 71-53 on Nov. 24 to record their first victory.

What to expect: The Mids are somewhat inexperienced, but as with any military academy, they’ll play hard and tough for 40 minutes.

Davidson vs. Elon. Tuesday, 7 p.m., Belk Arena

Last season: 9-20 (4-10, seventh in Big South).

The history: Beat Davidson 75-69 last season and 75-70 in 1999.

So far: Elon’s two losses have come against ACC teams Wake Forest and Florida State, with its two victories against N.C. A&T and Lynchburg. Senior guard Brendon Rowell (18.7 ppg) is dangerous as a spot-up shooter and penetrator. He scored 22 points in last year’s victory. Elon is 3-28 on the road since joining the Division I ranks in 1999.

What to expect: The Wildcats will play angry. After being embarrassed by the Phoenix in each of the past two seasons, they’ll be eager for revenge.

The Saturday before Thanksgiving break, Cannon Natatorium echoed with splashes and cheers as the Wildcats competed against the Tribe of William and Mary. On November 17, Davidson faced incredible competition and fell to the Tribe by a slim margin. The women lost 125-116, and the men fell 121-104. The Wildcats posed a serious threat to the Tribe, with the women dominating four events and the men controlling six.

Kelsey Holmberg ’04 placed first in the 1000 free with a time of 10:44.89. Teammate Jenny Hoekstra ’05 won the 50 and 100 free. Jamie Sasanfar touched the wall only .04 seconds behind Hoekstra in the 50 free. Sophomore Sara Laws secured the 200 back for Davidson, winning the event in 2:08.12.

In men’s competition, Mike Warner won both the 50 and the 100 free, with times of 22.15 and 48.25, respectively. In the 200 back, Charlie Hunter ’04 finished first and co-captain Nick Blackwell placed second. The relay team, composed of co-captain Steven Reece ’02, Blackwell, and Laurent Ropars ’03, secured first place for Davidson in the 400 free relay in 3:23.58. For the dive team, Chris Wrobleski ’05 performed well, winning the one-meter and three-meter events.

Co-captain Nick Blackwell was pleased by the team’s performance at the meet, “I was proud how a lot of our guys stepped it up and really competed and raced against them. There were a lot of swims that were season bests so far for us, and I think that is a good sign of what we are capable of doing in the upcoming meets and ultimately at the end of the season at the conference meet.”

The Wildcats have one more meet this season. November 30 and December 1, they will host a meet against UNC-Wilmington, Gardner-Webb, and South Carolina. The meet begins at 6 pm on Friday and continues at noon on Saturday.
