**It Is Time To Act**

Almost two years ago Davidson's trustees laid down their segregationist admissions policy in one terse sentence: “It is not in the best interest of Davidson College to admit Negroes at this time.” The trustees come to Davidson for a meeting Wednesday. We call their attention again to this racial ban, for it is a moral burden which will not be made lighter by silence or neglect.

The trustee policy contradicts the resolutions of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the South. It would be illegal according to constitutional authority if Davidson were a public institution. It is a dehumanizing policy which sets up color, not capability, as the standard for admission to Davidson. It is a policy which flouts both logic and the Christian ideals to which Davidson is committed.

The trustee policy has been discredited not only by conscience; it has been discredited by time: since the trustees’ decision to bar qualified Negro applicants at Davidson, we have seen the rapid breakdown of Jim Crow barriers in Southern education. State institutions have been the first to open their doors: North Carolina’s public institutions, universities in the border states, and now in Georgia. Private secular institutions are beginning to follow: Last week the trustees of the University of Miami stated that henceforth “all qualified applicants will be admitted to the University without regard to race or color.”

The church colleges of the South—Davidson conspicuous among them—are lagging. They are protected by their standing as “private” institutions before the law, and they are resisting those who remind them of responsibility to a higher Law. The Church, which should be leading, has been left behind.

Davidson’s trustees meet Wednesday in the face of a resolution passed last week by the North Carolina Council of Churches urging church colleges to consider “prayerfully and without delay” opening their doors to persons of all races. “The moral leadership of the Church in the world,” said the Council, “is seriously imperiled by discrimination.” That fact should be plain enough in a world which is seeing the revolutionary rise of black men demanding justice: men who watch America and judge her by her evil as well as by her good. We can ill afford to contribute to that evil—and we fool ourselves to imagine that what we do here has no impact in the world.

It is time to act. THE DAVIDSONIAN urges the formation of a student-faculty-trustee committee to keep alive this issue which few want to face, to formulate recommendations to the Trustees in keeping with the best ideals of liberal education and the Church. It must be the responsibility of the Church and of educated men to fight injustice, not to cling to it; to work against prejudice, not to perpetuate it; to encourage opportunity, not to forestall it. We should not wait for the pressure of law or the pressure of opinion to make us do right; we should do right in response to the pressure of conscience. If we do not have the courage to accomplish this, the value of our education is cast in doubt and our Christianity exposed as a mockery.

**Judicial Board: Harmful Legislation**

Monday, February 20, the Student Council will present its newly revised Student Body Constitution in chapel. The new constitution will include a Judicial Board composed of five members of the Student Council including the president, the two vice-presidents, and the secretary-treasurer. The Judicial Board will replace the Honor Court in trying all violations of Article X of the present constitution. This article includes student body regulations on conduct unbecoming a Davidson gentleman, possession of alcoholic liquors on campus, hazing, gambling, etc.

The council has stated that the purpose of establishing the Judicial Board is to separate the handling of offenses of honor—of which they say there are no intermediate degrees between innocence and guilt—from the handling of violations of student body regulations which do involve degrees and require discretionary judgments. According to one council member, another purpose of the Judicial Board is to unify the definition and enforcement of the student body regulations in the hands of one group.

THE DAVIDSONIAN is opposed to the adoption of the Judicial Board. At present the Honor Court is not overworked enforcing the honor system and the student body regulations. Since September the Honor Court has conducted only three trials. The adoption of the Judicial Board will only transfer jurisdiction from one organ of government to another.

Under the new constitution, a student who pledges one hour in the language laboratory, but stays only 55 minutes, would be tried by the Honor Court for a violation of the honor system. Since there can be no discretionary judgment by the Honor Court, he must either be dismissed from college, or declared innocent. We feel that this would be narrow and illogical. We see no reason why the Honor Court should not have the power, like any civil court, to interpret the law which it is enforcing. Why should only the Student Council have the power of interpretation?

Under the new constitution it may often be necessary to shuttle cases from one court to another. If a student lied under oath to the Judicial Board, he would then have to be tried by the Honor Court for an honor violation. Instead of unifying the judiciary branch of student government, it would confuse it. In some cases there would be much delay and confusion because neither court could be certain who had jurisdiction.

We recognize that many violations of Article X are not being punished, such as the possession of alcoholic liquors on campus and unnecessary noise in the dormitories. But it is not necessary to form a new court to enforce these regulations; a more active role by the Honor Court and more student support can solve this problem. We consider this a harmful piece of legislation. We urge the student body to vote against it.

**CONTACT WITH REAL GREATNESS**

**Reporters Are Awed, Fascinated Interview With Jimmie Byrnes**

By JOE MARTIN and JOHN HARRIS

The sign on the Security Federal Building flashes alternately “33°” and “10:23.” You hurry toward it through the melting snow, thinking that an early arrival for your 10:30 appointment will give you a few minutes to sit down and collect your thoughts. You take the elevator to the fifth floor and knock on the door marked 501. Miss Cassie Connor answers the door—you've read about her—and, without even giving you a chance to take off your overcoat, ushers you into the office of the Honorable James F. Byrnes.

**PUBLIC SERVANT**

To you, he’s “Governor Byrnes;” to other people—older people—he’s known by the titles of a half-century spent in public service: U. S. Congressman, 1911-25; U. S. Senator, 1931-41; U. S. Supreme Court Justice, 1941-42; “Asst. President” with final authority over domestic affairs, 1943-45; U. S. Secretary of State, 1945-46; Governor of South Carolina, 1951-55. You're a little ill at ease in his presence, and you ask about his recent trip to New York. As he talks about hunting in S. C. and Alabama, and about mutual friends (“You know the Boykins down there? Great hunters, all of them”), you begin to understand why he is known simply as “Jimmie” to thousands of people—millworkers in your home town, Presidents of the U. S. from Taft to Truman, colored barbers and Prime Ministers. You realize that you are talking to a man who really walked with kings, yet never lost the common touch.

**RELAXED, PERSONABLE**

In spite of his relaxed, personable manner, though, you know that this is the man whom Harry S. Truman was to have nominated for the second spot on the Democratic ticket of 1944, a position from which he would have ascended to the presidency of the nation in 1945, and you're still awed. You had thought of a hundred questions to ask him—about Stalin and Churchill, about FDR, about his failure to support a Democratic candidate for President since 1944, about Wilson and the League of Nations—but when he suddenly offers you the opportunity to ask questions, your mind goes blank.

**THE LEAGUE FIGHT**

You remember Wilson, and you ask for an impression of the fight between the President and Cabot Lodge over the League. He leans back in his red-leather chair and begins a rambling recitation of the events surrounding that conflict. He gives you character sketches of the men with whom he worked—Cabot Lodge, Woodrow Wilson, Jack Garner, Champ Clark. When he closes his eyes to recall a speech by Sen. Reed of Missouri in the Congress in 1921, you have a sense of history unfolding before you.

So it seems this boy Ervin Duggan writes in their student newspaper—the Davidson Collegian I think the name of it is—that we trustees don’t know enough about the college.

**“WE CHOOSE LOVE”**

Shue Looks For Leadership, Expression ofChristian Ideal
By HENRY SHUE

Our generation has been called, among other names, the “generation without a cause”—the generation which follows no heroes and commits itself to no ideals. Like all other generalizations, this one is an oversimplification, but it is largely true of white American young people. If we white youths have no causes for which we yearn to live, the Trustees of Davidson College should be concerned to give leadership to the 900 for whom they have accepted much responsibility. The Trustees should know that we have not always been disillusioned about principles and unconcerned about responsibility to others. When we entered Davidson, most of us were vigorous idealists who believed that some values are worth sacrificing oneself for. We even believed that statements like “God is love” were more than poetry and that images like the Oneness of the Body of Christ—the Church—were supposed to be put into practice. We were really children then!

We are wiser now—we know that love is an ideal to be praised by professors in the classroom but not to be practiced in the efficient policies of the college. We are glad that we are no longer naive, but we do wish that we had some purpose for which to live as in our younger days we had silly dreams about trying through love to help make the Presbyterian Church, U.S. a part of the One Body of Christ. If the Davidson student body's portion of our generation can see no leaders to follow in great purposes, it is not because we are not looking. In fact, we know that we must find a leader and an ideal somewhere, for without them we cannot justify our existence. We see only two alternatives; life with a purpose is one. We cannot endure a life with no purpose. But the cause to which we give ourselves must be worthy of our all.

The Trustees’ racially discriminatory admission policy is a major cause of our disillusionment with the Christian faith as it is presented to us here as a possible focus for our lives. We used to think Jesus and his teachings were worth living for, but we have been taught by our Trustees’ policy, perhaps, that they are irrelevant. You certainly cannot expect an ethic of self-giving love for all men to be relevant to the admission policy of a Southern college in 1960—you cannot base practice today on naive and soft idealism like this first-century talk about love. Outside the church among humanists, naturalists, agnostics, and atheists, we find courageous stands and love of fellow men. In the decision of the Trustees of this church institution, we see “It is not in the best interests of Davidson College...”

We do not expect an impossible altruism of an organized group, but we cannot believe that where there is no justice, there is nevertheless love. Loving a man necessitates giving him at least justice. If the Trustees’ decision to keep Davidson segregated is an expression of the depth and breadth of the spirit of love which is still alive in the church's institutions, we seem to be forced to choose between the teachings—in the official practice—of the church school and the courageous love of those outside the church who seem genuinely and sacrificially concerned about their fellows. If we must choose between love and the church institutions, we choose love because we need a worthy ideal to justify our existence. The Trustees meet on February 15. We look for a worthy ideal and for leadership. We hope to find them within the church, but we will not give our all to unworthy causes. If the church institutions prove unloving and narrow, we choose love—wherever it is real—and we will follow heroes who are men of love—wherever they lead us.

ARMED MERCHANT SHIPS

He tells a long story about Wilson and the controversy over arming merchant ships in WWI. “... Some of us who were vain enough to consider ourselves the leaders of the Congress went to the White House to tell the President that we would not be able to sustain his position, that we could not defeat the McLemore bill. Wilson listened to each of us and then said, ‘Gentlemen, I know that I have no finer friends in the Congress, and I value your opinions. But I have reached the decision that I must make the fight, and what is more, I must ask you to make it for me. If you persist in your defeatist attitude, I have no hope of success. At Princeton, we always thought we'd lose our football games with Harvard, and I can’t ever remember beating them. But when we played Holy Cross, we always thought we'd win, and we beat them every time.’ By the time the President had finished, he had convinced me and, I guess, the others, that we shouldn't have wasted the damn fellow's time. We went back to the Hill ready to make the fight, and we beat the devil out of our foes in the Congress!”

“TOO DAMN BRILLIANT”

He goes on to talk about President Kennedy (“That young fellow doesn’t know what he's in for”) and presidential advisor Arthur Schlesinger (“He’s too damn brilliant; I’m scared of him.”) When he’s not looking at you, you're studying him closely. You notice that he’s getting old; you think he must be close to 85. His hair is pure white, but he still has the slanted eyebrows and angular features by which he was recognized in cartoons.

SHARED GREATNESS

His speech is deliberate and comes with an effort, but it’s the same patrician accent which explained wartime policy to millions of Americans. The thought strikes you that greatness—shared—never grows old, and your mind wanders off in pursuit of a clever way of saying that. By 11:20 you’re back on the street; laughing about being slapped on the back by the Secretary of State and “shaking the hand that shook the hand...” but the idea of barging in on greatness sticks with you, and you decide to recommend it to others. You know that this hour has given you a contact with real greatness, and you know the memory of it will recur many times.

FOCUS: A Midwinters Fantasy: Love Among The Cools
By ERVIN DUGGAN

“I took a dive in Children’s Lit to come down here,” she said. “Miss Grumb thinks I’m in bed with mono.” She was drinking Scotch and every time she lifted the paper cup her charm bracelet jangled faintly. “What is the name of that combo?” she said, tracing a circle on the floor with her Weejun. And I said, “They are the Dumpers.” And she said, “Oh. They were at Fancy Dress, at the Phi Delt house.” I gazed at her, and I said: “Yeah.” The big room was dim and crowded and the Dumpers were loud.

“Tell me about yourself,” I said.

“Well, there’s nothing to tell, really. I'm majoring in Elementary Ed but I do not want to teach. I like the Masters and the Camden Cup. And I have spent all the summers since my puberty at Ocean Drive.”

“That’s enough for me,” I said, and I thought, she has a soul. For a moment we watched the dancers and the drinkers and the vocal group, which had formed a human pyramid with Mamie, the star, on top. Mamie was beating on the ceiling with a pair of red shoes, and it was rhythmical. I said, “Let’s dance,” and she put down the cup and patted her French twist. “O.K.,” she said. In a minute we were dancing; her stitched-down pleated skirt was swirling. Once, she stepped on my Weejun and she said, “Did I step on your Weejun?” And I smiled and said, “No, it was my fault. I stepped on your Weejun.” And once she brushed close to me and she inhaled and said, “English Leather?” “No, Bay Rum,” I answered and I looked at her through my shades, deep into her shades, and we saw each other. The music slowed and the Dumpers played Watusi Love and we danced close; I knew she was breathing hard beneath the camel's hair cardigan. My temples were throbbing. I held her to me and her gold circle pin touched my Harris Tweed lapel and suddenly I knew that this was it.

“Let’s tip on out,” I whispered.

“Oh, yes,” she said breathlessly, “Let's tip.” I put on my London Fog and helped her into her camel-color polo coat and we left. And in the car, in the close darkness of the back seat, she removed her shades and there her eyes were, and her charm bracelet jangled and we made out. Once, toward dawn, she sat up and said, “What's ‘vacuity’? Do you know what ‘vacuity’ means?”

“No,” I said. “Don’t think about it.” So we made out some more. The Dumpers were still playing but it sounded very distant and I was thinking: This is it.
