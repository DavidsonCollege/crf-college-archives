We're looking for people who look at this glass and say:

“There's gotta be other glasses of water.”

We need people capable of going beyond half-full or half-empty thinking. People who see subtleties. Who are quite frankly bored by easy answers and off-the-shelf solutions.

People who are constantly challenging their own thinking and are thirsty for new ideas and knowledge.

You'll have a degree from a top school. Getting a job won't really be an issue. The question is: which job? Which industry?
