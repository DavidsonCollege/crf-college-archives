ORIENTATION WEEK INDUCTS FROSH INTO CAMPUS LIFE

VOL. XXIV DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N.C.

FACULTY INSTIGATE ‘ORIENTATION WEEK’

Program Started to Accustom Incoming Class to Campus Life

WELCOMED BY GWYNN

Dr. John McSween Gives Inspiring Address

Beginning this year, the faculty of Davidson is instigating what is called “Orientation Week.” The purpose of this program is
to help the Freshmen get accustomed to, and acquainted with, the life and activities of the campus. The class of
1940, one of the largest in the history of the college, arrived on the scene nearly a week before the
upper-classmen did. Thus, by the time the sophomores, juniors, and seniors got here, the freshmen were already beginning to get
used to the campus. This probably saved the freshmen from some of the embarrassing moments through which others have gone.
For the first few days of the Orientation period, the freshmen were all housed in East and West. The main
purpose of this was to let them get well acquainted among men of their own class. Later they moved to
permanent rooms in the other dormitories.

Gwynn Welcomes

Thursday, September 10, was the day on which most of the men came in. That morning there was a formal
meeting of the class at nine o'clock. At this meeting, Dr. P. H. Gwynn, Jr., gave a talk of welcome
and explained the purpose of “Orientation.” On Friday night, Dr. John McSween, of Chester, gave a very inspirational talk entering
college. In his address, Dr. McSween brought out the fact that the “folks back (Continued on Page 6)

MAJOR J. L. BALLARD BEGINS R.O.T.C. DUTIES

Takes Major Cochran’s Place As Freshman Military Instructor

Davidson College has a new instructor this year. Major James L. Ballard, who comes to us from the 26th Infantry,
Plattsburg Barracks, will take the place of Major Cochran. Major Ballard will have charge of freshman instruction. Prior to his
stay at Plattsburg, he had been stationed in Hawaii, the Philippines, and several points in the United States. Major Ballard
is a native North Carolinian, having been born at Burnsville. He is a graduate of the infantry school and the
chemical warfare school. He entered the service in 1911 and has been in active service since that time. Major Ballard
is accompanied by his wife and two sons, James L., Jr., and Robert. James will enter the sophomore class and
Robert will enter High School. Major Ballard states he picked Davidson mainly because he is a native North Carolinian.

FOUR JUNIORS NAMED NEW CHEER LEADERS

Seven Answered Gene Vogler’s First Call Late Last Spring

AIDED IN DUKE GAME

Will Be Trained in Novelty Gymnastics

Seven men answered Senior Cheer Leader Vogler’s call for Junior assistants. Four of these men were elected by the student
body in an election held in chapel Tuesday morning. The call for the Juniors was issued late last night after
which several days of training were given and again at the beginning of school, the juniors, along with Vogler, practiced
along with the incoming freshman class. Those elected to fill the four vacancies were: Elmore Holt, Jerry Harris, and Wade
Barrow, who were elected by majority. A run-off vote to determine the fourth man was held this morning between Sam
Ryburn and Willard Dixon. Bill Rader and Ernest Dooley were eliminated in the first vote. This year, the training schedule
for the cheer leaders is to be probably more strenuous than heretofore due to the novel acrobatic (Continued on Page

FIEDLER OPENS MUSICAL YEAR

Boston Sinfonietta to Play Monday; Is Part of Boston Symphony

FOUR PROGRAMS BOOKED

Wilson Angel and Siberian Singers Coming

The Davidson College Concert series for 1936-37 will begin September 28, the first concert being the Boston Sinfonietta conducted by
Arthur Fiedler. This ensemble of prominent members of the Boston Symphony Orchestra was organized ten years ago by Mr. Arthur
Fiedler who saw a need for such an organization. The object of the Sinfonietta, in the words of Dr. Koussevitzky,
the noted conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra is, “giving many people the opportunity to hear music finely performed.” This
small organization can give concerts in communities where it would be inadvisable to take the larger Symphony. The Sinfonietta has
met with notable success and has received praise from critics and the public. Mr. Fiedler has established for himself an
enviable reputation as a conductor and musician. As a member of the Boston Symphony Orchestra (Continued on Page 6)

Professors Resume Work

Many Faculty Members Study Abroad; Others Relax at Summer Resorts

From ancient ivied towers, the snow-capped Andes to Heidelberg’s professors, Davidson College professors were vacationing and studying this summer in
anticipation of work in the session. Chalmers G. Davidson, formerly of Chester, S.C., a 1928 graduate of Davidson, came here
to be librarian and assistant professor of bibliographical history. He takes the place vacated by Miss Cornelia Shaw, for nearly
30 years college librarian. Professor John Crooks Bailey, of the Greek Department, was recently appointed as assistant to President Walter
L. Lingle and will serve in that capacity next year. F. L. Blythe, professor of Spanish, spent the entire summer
in a tour of Spanish-speaking countries of Central and South America. His trip is taking him to Lima, Peru, and
other places. Dr. G. R. Vowles, professor of German, traveled through Germany with his son, Richard. Dr. Vowles had a
special invitation to attend the 550th anniversary of the University of Heidelberg and will represent Davidson at that occasion. He
will also attend the Olympic games. Henry T. Lilly, professor of English, studied Italian at a well-known university in Italy.
Dr. Kenneth J. Foreman and family vacationed on an island off the coast of Maine. Dr. P. H. Gwynn, Jr.,
Professor of Education, who has been teaching at Duke summer school, retired to (Continued on Page 6)

DAVIDSON APPROACHES CENTENNIAL

Committee Named and Plans For Celebration

NEED NEW BUILDINGS

Formal Program in Connection with Graduation

With the opening of its 100th session, Davidson College is preparing for the celebration of its Centennial. The following statement
was adopted: “That you appoint a joint committee of trustees and faculty to co-operate with the administration in inaugurating and
carrying forward a Centennial movement to raise funds to meet some of the most urgent needs of the college, it
being understood that the committee will have full authority to have sketches of the campus and toremained at that institution
one year, and since that time prepared the necessary literature. After graduation, as coach, he held a position with a
business concern. He then went to China for four years as sales manager for Liggett and Myers Tobacco Company, returning
in 1928 to accept a position at Guilford College. Serving there as athletic director, publicity director, and student body advisor,
he was greatly disappointed to learn of Unger's resignation and reluctantly accepted it.

In accordance with that resolution, the following committee was appointed: (Continued on Page 6)

An Editorial

The appearance of new men who, in turn, will take it up immediately with the President of the Student Body,
and because a number of upperclassmen understand the duty of protecting the Honor System and the operation of the Honor
System, it is imperative that everyone recognize the duty of protecting the Honor System. Any student who sees a principle
of honor being violated must report the matter, or else he himself is guilty of dishonor. Loyalty to the Student
Body demands that one make this report. This can in no wise be construed as spying or tale-bearing. It is
the finest expression of loyalty to a cherished tradition of honor among a community of self-governing students.

The Student Council, duly elected by the students, represents the opinion of the students in this college and is in
no way responsible to the faculty. It is also important that every student should exercise the greatest care to keep
himself free from suspicion of evil. Such practices as leaving the examination room for any length of time, bringing texts
and notebooks into the examination room, or carelessly glancing toward another student's paper—these are heartily condemned by the Student Council.
While they do not of themselves constitute infringements of the Honor System, such practices are highly dangerous both for the
individual and for the continued well-being of the Honor System.

The Honor System has lately been put to very serious tests and in many of our sister institutions has proved
inadequate. The reason is that the work which the student hands in to his professor is his own, which he
himself has done in accordance with the requirements of the course as laid down by the professor. The faculty will
co-operate in establishing a clear understanding of the requirements. In any case of doubt as to the nature or extent
of a pledge, the student should immediately request that the professor in charge make the requirements perfectly clear to the
entire class.

The Honor System requires in the second place that, when a student sees another student in suspicious circumstances, he shall,
as secretly and as speedily as possible, report the charge to the President of the Student Body or to any
member of the Student Council. The Honor System has been put to very serious tests and in many of our
