Clewell predicts energy shortages
By LYMAN COLLINS
Assistant News Editor

This year’s Woodrow Wilson Fellow and Senior Vice-President of Mobil Oil Company, Dr. D. H. Clewell, spoke at Davidson March
15-19. Clewell discussed several topics during his five-day visit, including the world role of multinational corporations, free speech, and the
college press. His main topic, however, was the oil industry and its place in the world today.

"Oil production in the United States peaked out in 1970," said Clewell. "Since then we’ve been importing 40 percent of
our oil. If we don’t start increasing our own supplies, in 10 years we'll be buying 75 percent of our
oil from foreign countries," he predicted.

"For fifteen years the oil industry has been saying that the U.S. was going to be running out of oil
and we should be concerned with this problem," he said. "But I don’t think it’s as much the fault of
the government as it is the American people who don’t believe in an oil shortage."

"How do you get people to look down the road 30 to 40 years instead of just two years to
the next election? I don’t have the answer," continued Clewell. He explained how he felt the government should arrest America’s
decline in oil production, saying that America should increase its use of coal. "We’re sort of like Saudi Arabia and
oil when it comes to coal," he said, adding, "We have a great abundance of it but we use gas
where in many places we should use coal."

Clewell also advocated the increased use of nuclear power. "I think we should go ahead and put more nuclear power
plants here. Europe is doing it," he explained. "The Soviet Union is doing it. This doesn’t mean that we forget
about the environment."

Another way to increase our oil production, he said, was to open up more areas of the U.S. for drilling.
"There are many virgin areas, particularly in off-shore areas where we're now having problems getting permits," said Clewell.

"The oil business has taken a beating in the last two years," said Clewell. "We are the victim of a
public lash-out because we’re the handiest people to blame when the public gets concerned about the rise in prices. We
feel this attitude is expressed an awful lot by the T.V. people; we don’t feel they give a complete picture,"
he continued.

Clewell further explained that JOIN YAF and help in the battle for free enterprise and limited government.

What Is YAF?
YOUNG AMERICANS FOR FREEDOM was founded by young men and women who care about the future of our nation and
our world—young men and women concerned about the problems we face today as individuals and as a nation. Four decades
of giving centralization of power have brought the increasing violation of individual rights, with an enslaving...dependency of more and more
millions of Americans on government. The creation of a welfare class, the growing impersonalization in society, and the disintegration of
a sense of community all threaten to destroy the integrity of the individual. A government-controlled economy has created more problems
and greater instability while the average American faces more and more taxes and inflation. If you are concerned about the
future of America and the world, we invite you to join with us in the national conservative youth organization—Young Americans
for Freedom.

Mobil had tried to buy time on television to present what they felt was their side of the issue. "We
were constantly turned down. It’s controversial and they said they’re the only ones who can talk about it," he said.
Clewell dispelled the myth of huge profits by the oil companies. He said that Mobil made an average of only
1.5 cents on every gallon sold. He declared, "I think this reflects the measure of efficiency of the oil companies
in that we operate on that small a profit. Also, you have to look at our investments in refineries, off-shore
drilling platforms, and so forth."

Clewell also pointed to the $200 million Mobil pours into environmental protection. He said this money was used to remove
sulfur dioxide from smokestacks, clean up tankers to help prevent oil spills, and clean up wastes from refineries. He also
said that Mobil is constantly experimenting to improve its methods of oil exploration. "Only 12 percent of all exploratory wells
yield any oil," he said. "And only two percent find commercial oil." Although exploratory wells represent only 10 percent of
all oil wells, Clewell said that they were the most expensive. "This is a very risky business," he explained.

Clewell also scoffed at the idea of an oil monopoly. "A monopoly causes inefficiency. I don’t think there is a
more competitive industry than the oil industry," he said. "There are 25 major oil companies. Compare that to the TV
industry or the auto industry. I think you’d have a hard time finding another industry today with 25 major companies,"
Clewell continued. "You've got to have big institutions though, because this is a big country. People don't realize just how
big this country is and how big our government is. It has a budget into the trillions of dollars," he
said. "But for all this, we have about the most stable government in the world. America’s resiliency is really something,"
he concluded.
