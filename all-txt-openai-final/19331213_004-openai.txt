**Residents’ Petition to Town Council Granted**

The residents of Sloan Street, on Thursday, December 4, presented a formal list of signatures petitioning the Town Council of
Davidson to change the name of the street, formerly known as Sloan Street, to that of Lorimer Road. The petition
was granted.

The change was effected by citizens living on this street in honor of Professor William Lorimer Porter, who was one
of its first residents. The street, located in the southeast portion of Davidson, obtained its name from J. Lee Sloan,
former mayor and postmaster of Davidson, who died several years ago.Several years ago, a fatal case of Tularemia, commonly known
as “rabbit fever,” was reported. The disease was contracted while the patient was cleaning a wild rabbit he had shot.
Rarely are cases of this kind fatal, with only fourteen having been reported. However, this case showed a rapid invasion
of the lung tissue by the bacillus tularemia, and death came about three weeks after the onset. Dr. Gudger graduated
from Davidson College in 1925, took his medical work at the Medical College of Virginia, and has been on the
staff of the Ford Hospital for three years. He entered Davidson from Mooresville. The report of the case was published
by the American Medical Association in booklet form.

Sinclair Lewis Topic of Eumenian Society Talk

A paper on the life of Sinclair Lewis, a short story, “The Victim,” and a discussion of current events were
the order of the Eumenian Literary Society program which was given at the meeting last Tuesday night. John D. Allen
discussed the life of Sinclair Lewis and showed how it had affected his writing. “The idea of ‘Arrowsmith’,” Allen brought
out, “was due to the fact that Lewis’ brother was a doctor.” “The unorthodox character of the doctor-hero,” he said,
“was a revelation of the real Sinclair Lewis.” Bob Stewart read a short story entitled, “The Victim,” and J. E.
Dillard led the discussion on current events which brought the program to a close.

Union College, Schenectady, won its first radio debate from Hartwick College recently. Pictures of the events will be shown to
the alumni at the meetings next spring. One of the cameras was tried at the Wake Forest game, and worked
all right. It is believed that the showing of the pictures to the alumni will do more toward increasing their
interest in the college than any speeches that could be made. The association desires to purchase a 16 mm. camera,
and would like to get one as cheaply as possible. Any alumni knowing of one that is for sale, please
notify the alumni secretary.

Committee for Rhodes Scholarships Is Named

There will be competition for the Rhodes Scholarships this year in every state. The forty-eight states will be divided into
eight districts and the committee of each state may nominate two men to appear before the district committee. The district
committee will select from the candidates the four best qualified to represent their states at Oxford. An appointment is made
for two years in the first instance, but if the student can present a plan of study for the next
year satisfactory to his college and to the Rhodes Trustees, he may remain for the third year. The candidates from
the various colleges will meet the committee on January 4, probably at Chapel Hill. The following constitute the North Carolina
Committee of Selection for the Rhodes Scholarships: Chairman, John Sprunt Hill, Trust Building, Durham, N. C.; Secretary, Prof. F. K.
Mitchell, Duke University, Durham, N. C.; members, Dr. G. R. Vowles, Davidson College, Davidson, N. C.; Prof. Harvie Branscomb, Duke
University, Durham, N. C.; Prof. R. K. Gooch, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Va.; William J. Cocke, Jr., Jackson Building, Asheville,
N. C.

Many notables attended this convention, including Dr. T. W. Lingle, professor of history at Davidson and vice-president of the society.
It is customary for a prominent speaker from another state to deliver the chief address, and this year Professor Fox
of Columbia University was the featured speaker. Mr. Latham, of Asheville, who spoke on “The Economic Outlook of North Carolina,”
and President Rippey held prominent places on the program. Friday morning Dr. Lingle attended the chapel exercises of Wake Forest
College, which had previously requested him to address the student body. His talk to the students was along historical lines.
While attending this meeting, Dr. Lingle held conferences with various officials of Duke, N. C. State College, and University, but
the nature of these conferences has not yet been divulged.

BLAZERS ARRIVE

Quite a few members of the class of 1934 can now be seen wearing their new blazers which arrived last
week. The blazers this year are two-button, single-breasted sport coats of navy-blue flannel. On the breast pocket of each coat,
there is a large light-gray "D" which contains the class numerals, "34."
