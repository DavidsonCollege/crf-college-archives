NEW MEMBERS RECEIVED BY SIGMA UPSILON.
The wearers of the flaring blue ribbons have at last secured a more modest badge—the scarab of Sigma Upsilon. After the arduous tasks of goatdom, they are now true members of the beetles. Those who attended the first lyceum will remember the two coy maidens who sat on the front bench making eyes with Mr. Bingham, and the stylish young gentleman who escorted them. Those three, J. M. Gaston, C. J. Matthews, and C. G. Long, were officially initiated into the Blue Pencil Chapter on last Wednesday night. After the initiation ceremony, the whole chapter enjoyed a feed prepared to resuscitate the rather worn-out neophytes. Most of the members then took a midnight auto ride to Mooresville.

DAVIDSON AND RANDOLPH-MACON TO DEBATE DECEMBER SEVENTH
Davidson meets Randolph-Macon in Shearer Hall on December 7, in the first inter-collegiate debate of the season. The query has been agreed upon. It is, Resolved: That the Federal Government should for a period of 20 years prohibit the immigration of Japanese laborers into the U.S. or any of its possessions. The Debating Council has elected that Davidson uphold the affirmative. The first preliminaries are scheduled for October 27. At that time a team composed of three men and an alternate will be chosen from each society. These two teams will meet on November 6 for the second discussion of the question. At that time will be chosen the team, composed of two men and an alternate, which will meet Randolph-Macon. Davidson's debating teams were not successful last year in either of the two major debates. This year it is up to the two societies to produce a team that will “romp all over” the visitors. It is planned to debate several colleges in the spring. As yet nothing definite has been decided regarding the proposed debates.

A NEW HEBREW CLUB ON THE SCENE.
The Ministerial and Volunteer bands held a joint meeting in Charlotte last Saturday night. Hearing that a lecture of Toblestky was to be given at the Keith Auditorium, most of the members went there. The meeting was led by P. D. Miller, with the able assistance of R.R. McIlwaine. The front seat, vulgarly called the “baldhead row” had been reserved for this distinguished group of gentlemen by an ardent admirer, R. J. Knight. Others occupying this section with the aforesaid gentlemen were, H. O. McGukin, L. C. Wilkinson, E. H. Tufts, T. M. Lowry, and M. W. Doggett. They were so enthused with the character and life of the eminent Jewish statesman that they immediately decided to form a Toblestky Club. C. J. Matthews was elected the first president. Their motto is, “Toblestky says.” All men wishing to join will please hand their names in to the president at the earliest opportunity as the membership is to be limited to fifty.

POLITY CLUB LAYS FOUNDATIONS FOR YEAR'S WORK.
Dr. Lingle Discusses Purposes of the Organization — Nine Men Elected to Membership.
Dr. T. W. Lingle addressed the Polity Club at its first regular meeting of the year, which was held Tuesday night, October 5, in the history room. Dr. Lingle told of the plans and purposes of the founders of this organization which was established for the purpose of studying and promoting interest in affairs of national and international importance. This organization is nationally known as the International Relations Club, the branch at Davidson being known as the Polity Club. It is being arranged to have speakers who are well versed in national affairs come to Davidson to lecture on vital topics of the day. It is hoped that every student will become interested in topics of national and international importance.and that much benefit will be obtained from these lectures. After a further discussion of plans for the coming year, nine new members were elected to the club, these being A. D. King, H. White, J. R. Soulware, J. M. Gaston, Jr., F. E. Manning, J. R. Jones, A. M. Mitchell, H. Culbreth, and W. R. Booth.

SOMETHING NEW UNDER THE SUN

Beauty Section to Be Run in This Year’s Quips and Cranks.

Fellows! Something new is about to happen! Would you like to see a picture of your girl in the 1921 Quips and Cranks? You would, would you? The Annual management is going to give you that privilege! So get busy and get a picture of “the one and only” and hurry it in to Editor Long, or any member of the Staff. And remember—the picture doesn't have to pass a board of censors. If you haven't a girl, borrow your roommate's for the time being. He'd be glad to have her in twice.

This idea of having a picture of every fellow's girl is another progressive step that will make the 1921 Quips and Cranks the best yet. If you want her picture to adorn the pages of the best Annual in the South, hurry and give that picture to “Dbbie” Long at No. 2 Rumple. Come early and avoid the rush. He who hesitates is lost! No, her picture will not be run alongside yours but in the panels of the Q. and C. Beauty section!
