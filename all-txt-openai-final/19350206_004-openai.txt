Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

---

THE DAVIDSONIAN, FEBRUARY 6, 1935

WRESTLERS ARE UNDEFEATED IN THE FIELD OF SPORTS

WILDCATS TRIUMPH OVER PETRELS BY MARGIN

---

Note: The text "th Fy ld f S t CAE IVE DAY" and "FROM FIVE, DAY" were not clear in
the original OCR and seem to be garbled. If you have more context or additional text, it might help in
providing a more accurate correction.
