Approximately seven hundred girls converged on the Davidson campus today for the first dance weekend of the school year. Another
six to seven hundred alumni and friends of the college will arrive tonight and tomorrow for the 1958 Homecoming festivities.

"Let's give the band a big hand. That was a wonderful half-time show. There go the teams back on the
field. The second half will soon be under way. There goes 'Groveller' Grundy jogging to his place in the backfield."

**PHI DELT BETA**

Students, their dates, and guests may find a full schedule of Homecoming activities this weekend. Tonight's events include an Artist
Series program and a formal dance. This afternoon the Davidson soccer team was host to N.C. State in a contest
that furnished a preliminary beginning of activities.

**472 IN BELK**

Mrs. J. B. Moore, supervisor of dormitories, reported today that Belk dorm, the President's house, faculty homes, local residences, and
nearby motels were all filled by the inflow of girls. Normally 298 boys room in Belk, but this weekend 472
are occupying the President's house.

"Our big problem was that so many places normally used for dates are being used this year by students," commented
Mrs. Moore. She had to work with many boys in finding places for their dates to stay after the college
facilities had been filled.

John B. Horton, acting director of Alumni and Public Relations, expects an excellent representation of alumni for both the special
alumni activities and the Homecoming program in general. The majority of the alumni, however, will only be on campus for
Saturday’s program.

**Trustee Committee Has Normal Session**

The Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees met Thursday, October 23, at two p.m. in the Trustee Room. This
was a regular session of the committee held between the semi-annual Trustee meetings. President Martin stated, "This is a routine
Committee meeting before the Trustees meet on February 18." He added that no new proposals were treated. The meeting was
to report the progress of the administration since the Trustee meeting of May 15.

The major items before the Executive Committee were the building program, committee reports, and introduction of new members of the
administration. Concerning the building program, the Committee discussed the construction of the Dana Science Laboratories, the location of the new
dormitory, and the Dana Challenge Fund. The Challenge Fund is to raise $600,000 necessary to complete the two buildings.

Reports were heard from the following committees: building and grounds, religion and social life, and finances. Consideration of the over-crowded
Vesper services was delayed until the special student-faculty committee has had time to formulate an answer to the problem.

Mr. Martin gave the President’s report on the general condition of the college and introduced two new members of the
administration: Dean ofthe Faculty F. W. Johnson and Director of Alumni and Public Relations J. B. Horton. Both Dr. Johnson
and Mr. Horton filled administration vacancies during the first week of October.

Chapel Speaker

Charles S. Rhyne, immediate past-president of the American Bar Association, will speak during chapel on October 30. Mr. Rhyne, a
native of Mecklenburg County, is a practicing attorney in Washington, D.C. He is also on the faculty of the George
Washington University Law School in Washington and has served as a legal consultant to the office of Civil Defense. A
graduate of the undergraduate and law schools of Duke University, Mr. Rhyne gave the commencement speech at his alma mater
last year, at which time he was awarded an honorary LLD degree. He is the author of numerous legal books,
many of which are devoted to aeronautical law. A man of varied interests, the former president of the National Aeronautical
Association was featured on the cover of Time last spring. No announcement has been made of the text of Mr.
Rhyne’s speech as of yet. After chapel on October 30, a meeting of pre-law students and those who think they
might be interested in law will be held during the third period in the Union Ballroom. At that time, Mr.
Rhyne will discuss legal training and law as a profession.

Sara Wallace Modifies Fraternity Regulations

In view of changes brought about by the opening of the new fraternity court, the faculty, on September 17, under
the direction of Dr. W. G. McGavock, took steps to change certain regulations pertaining to social functions. This concerns Section
II, Social Functions, under Fraternities and Social Clubs in the Davidson College Regulations for Students Handbook. The following modifications have
been instituted:

Social Functions on the Campus: The present regulation reads, “When girls are in a fraternity house, it is necessary that
at least two couples be present at all times with one exception. It is permissible for one couple to be
in the house provided the housemother is on the premises and is notified of their presence.” Formerly, the rule stated,
“When girls are invited to a fraternity house, it is necessary that at least two couples be present at all
times.”

Closing Hours: The present regulation reads, “Fraternity houses and the Court shall be vacated by all girls by midnight, except
for dance weekends and special occasions for which permission has been granted by the Dean of Students. On dance weekends
fraternity houses and the Court shall be vacated by all girls by 5:00 a.m. Saturday morning and 3:00 a.m. Sunday
morning.” Formerly, the rule stated, “Fraternity houses and the Court shall be vacated by all visitors at midnight on Saturdays
and nights of all social functions at which girls are present, except for dance weekends and special occasions when permission
may be obtained from the Dean of Students.”

General: The following statement has been added: “Out of consideration for the housemothers and people in the neighborhood of Fraternity
Court, any student remaining in a fraternity house after midnight is expected to be reasonably quiet.”

The June 1958 issue of “The Journal of the History of Ideas” carried a six-page article by Professor J. Wilson
McCutchan of the English Department. The title of Professor McCutchan’s article was “Justice and Equity in the English Morality Play.”
Material in the article is a condensation of a paper read at the University of Kentucky Language Conference in April
of 1957 before the Medieval section. The paper points out another one of the areas of English society described by
the writers of the morality plays, and it shows that the native drama often reflected in realistic fashion the life
of the period. In essence, the article adduces additional proof that the morality play progressed from its first form of
an abstract dramatization of theological concepts to that of a social commentary in dramatic form.

DYER-BENNET TONIGHT

Richard Dyer-Bennet, renowned minstrel and guitarist, initiates this year’s Artist Series in Chambers Auditorium at 8:00 tonight. His repertoire will
include a rendition of America’s most popular folk songs.

Lester Lanin's Orchestra is supplying the music for both the formal dance tonight and the informal one tomorrow. Planned by
the Interfraternity Council, the dances are being held in Johnston Gymnasium. The various fraternities and the Independents are having after-dance
parties tonight and affairs at the fraternity houses tomorrow. The time limits for the after-dance parties are 5:00 a.m. Saturday
morning and 3:00 a.m. Sunday.

Beta Theta Pi Celebrates Hundred Years on Campus

This weekend marks the one hundredth anniversary of the social fraternity system at Davidson College. In 1858, Beta Theta Pi
became the first Greek letter fraternity on the campus. Within the next five years, the fraternity and almost the college
itself was blotted out by the bloody war between the States. Two decades after the war, a similar band of
brothers was organized as the Sword and Shield Chapter of the Mystic Seven national fraternity. Sword and Shield revived Beta
Theta Pi in 1890.

BANQUET

To culminate a weekend of celebration, the Phi Alpha Chapter of Beta Theta Pi will hold a banquet tomorrow night
at the Barringer Hotel in Charlotte. All alumni and their families have been invited; to date, over fifty alumni are
scheduled to return, representing classes ranging from 1900 to 1958. All day tomorrow, the house will be open to returning
alumni and friends, with a special tea given in the afternoon. At the banquet Saturday night, Laurens Walker, president of
the chapter, will act as master of ceremonies. George Adams, '50, will be on hand to introduce the evening speaker,
A. J. G. Priest, president of the national fraternity from 1951 to 1954. Priest attended the University of Idaho, where
he was president of his Beta chapter, president of his Senior Class, editor of the school newspaper, and a Phi
Beta Kappa graduate. Since that time, Priest has become preeminent in his legal career and well-known through his work in
world government. Throughout his alumni years, he has given himself wholeheartedly to the building of Beta Theta Pi. Priest has
distinguished himself in Beta circles by attending twenty-four conventions, serving as chairman of most of the important convention committees. He
has also been a convention toastmaster and a banquet speaker, delivering a series of addresses upon the great Beta leaders
of the past.

ALUMNI

Prominent alumni who will participate in the centennial celebration include: Dr. John R. Cunningham, former president of Davidson; Dr. D.
D. Phillips, president of the Phi Alpha alumni association; Dr. Frontis Johnston, dean of faculty; and Dr. Chalmers Davidson, librarian
of the college and chapter adviser. Dr. Davidson will introduce various alumni at the banquet.
