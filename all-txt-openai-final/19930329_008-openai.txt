**Reduced Shakespeare Company Delights Love Audience**

By Katherine Salt

The Abridged History of America presented by the Reduced Shakespeare Company was witty, imaginative, crazy, critical and to top it all off, truthful. The company, formed in 1981 in San Francisco, delivered a history lesson unlike any other at Davidson College or any other college and university, for that matter. Spanning a time period of over one thousand years, the company of three raced smoothly around the stage changing props and costumes while relating the American story. From the slaughtering of the Native Indians to the scandals of President Nixon and from the travails of factory women to the antics of female comedian Lucille Ball, the company mixed American pastimes with American politics. In doing so, they delved deep into American souls, ideals, and priorities.

Beginning with the line “It’s not the length of your history, it’s what you’ve done with it,” the players proceeded to show the progression of the American nation as it has destroyed whatever or whomever was in its path in order to gain wealth and power. As one player’s lines went happily: “Christopher Columbus was the first to slaughter the native Indians and become wealthy in the process. Yet that makes him the first, true-blooded American.” The storyline continued in an amazingly interesting and complex fashion as it incorporated the Battles of Lexington and Concord with the Grassy Knoll and the shooting of John F. Kennedy. The bullet used in this skit re-emerged in a skit depicting the death of Lincoln, thus creating a truly hilarious and insightful play. Skits like these re-occurred throughout the two-hour comedy. The wonderful use of audience participation and humor helped to ease over the very political and upsetting ideas that seemed to be the basis and the reason for the play. Such lines as “All men are created equal—Ha, ha, ha!” spoken by the founding fathers were a subtle way of expressing the inequalities that exist in our society. The actors did a terrific job of winging it as various unexpected things happened throughout the play. It became more enjoyable as even the actors themselves could not control their laughter at several of the jokes. Despite the humorous moments, it cannot be denied that the presentation gave a very negative impression of America, its people.

**Marley Reggae**

By Rice Lacey

“You’ll be here after the concert, right?” “No problem, mon,” responded our taxi-cab driver. All eight of us proceeded down the street, a huge target for all the vendors. You could tell we were in a third world country, but it was not until we came up on the crowd that we noticed the tropical breeze and flora of Jamaica. As we entered the hotel compound, I forgot all about our cab driver. We would worry about a ride after seeing Ziggy Marley.

Caught in the crowd following the path, we descended the tree-lined hill overlooking the stage and floor. On the other side of the floor, the ocean sprayed against the cliffs and beach. Still more or less together, we all scattered along the sand, with our backs to the water and wind. The stage was elaborately lit, and before I had a chance to survey the crowd, Julian Marley, Bob’s son, took the stage. When I had bought our tickets earlier that day, I had no idea the magnitude of the event. The Marleys had never previously performed together. Mother and widow Rita Marley energized the people with Bob’s “Lively Up Yourself,” and her classic tune “So High.” As vendors kept us well supplied with Red Stripe, we danced to Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers. I gradually moved closer and closer with the show’s building intensity. After “Tomorrow People” and some tracks off his new album, Ziggy grooved into some of Bob’s hits. The rest of the Marley family shortly joined him to jam to many of our favorites, but the songs were only part of the night. I soon found myself at the front of the stage and speakers; the Rastafarians, all around me, swung their dreadlocks. Before I knew it was over, I was being led up the hill and out to the street again. Luckily, our taxi-cab driver hadn’t forgotten us and took us to our hotel.

**A Chat with Davidson's Resident Rock and Roll Stars, Electro-luxe**

By Thomas Bavis

Electro-luxe is a hard name to avoid these days, especially on the Davidson campus. Hardly a month goes by that this band does not have a show in the area, and hardly a show takes place that is not supported by Davidson students. If you have ever seen them live or heard their tapes, no explanation of their popularity is needed—they are a fun band. When I spoke with them on Thursday night, I found that the band members, like their music, have the same attitude; they were witty and nerdy, and they refused to stay serious for long. I spoke with the band—drummer Michael Glaser, bassist Frank Guzek, and guitarists Randolph Lewis and John Morris—at their...House in Davidson. This is what they had to say.

Davidsonian: Have y'all graduated?

John: Well, Randy and I both graduated in 1991 as English majors. Michael graduated last year as a music major. Frank?

Frank: I'm still in school, as a music major. I guess I’m the spring chicken of the band.

Davidsonian: I hate to shatter the image of a rock and roll lifestyle, but you all have jobs, don’t you?

Michael: Yeah, we all have jobs besides Electro-luxe. We have to pay the bills. But we make a lot of time to do band stuff, especially recording.

Davidsonian: What’s the recording process like?

Randy: We have a “studio” in my bedroom—actually just a lot of recording equipment in a corner of my room. But it's decent equipment, and the recordings are of fairly high quality.

John: Sometimes we play demos for people and they’ll ask where we recorded them. Many are very surprised we did them in our own house, just the four of us.

Davidsonian: I suppose it’s a natural tendency for someone to compare a new band to groups of the past. When I listened to your songs, the Beatles and Big Star came to mind. Who do you think has most influenced your sound?

Randy: I grew up on the Beatles, as did John, and I guess it’s fair to say they were an influence. They did so much with recording techniques, which is something we have toyed with a lot lately. What was the state of art recording equipment for them twenty-five years ago is similar to the setup we have. So I have learned a lot from them about how to craft a song onto tape.

John: Big Star had an influence on me. They knew how to make a good pop song.

Frank: I didn’t listen to much music as a kid. In fact, I didn’t buy any tapes until I was in high school. The first two tapes I bought were by Iron Maiden and The Cure.

John: That explains a lot, Frank.

Michael: We’ve all listened to a lot of different types of music through the years, especially cutting-edge music like the Smiths and R.E.M., and a lot of it inevitably finds its way into our songs.

Davidsonian: What about playing live, do you enjoy that?

John: Oh, yeah. It’s a good way of trying out new material on people, and it’s fun to perform.

Davidsonian: Are there any shows in the near future for Electro-luxe?

Michael: As a matter of fact, we have two shows next week: the first one is on Thursday the first, at the Double Door. The second is at the Milestone on Saturday the third, and that’s a big show for us. We’re headlining there for the first time, a big turnout would bring us inexplicable joy.

And its history. The sad part is that every negative innovation was true to the core of American priorities and actions and everyone in the audience seemed to know it. The brilliant backtracking through the timeline of American history brought a sigh of both relief and disappointment as the audience became aware of how destructive American history has been. To the idealistic historian and the fanatical patriot, the play would have been a disgrace. To those who are not afraid to admit the truth and who have a sense of humor, it was two hours of fun and brilliantly imaginative acting.

It's Oscar Time Again: Our Picks
By Scott McLean

Well folks, it’s Oscar time again. Somehow that doesn’t seem to mean much this year though, partially because it was such a poor year for good cinema, but mainly because the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences always rewards the most politically correct films of the year instead of those pictures and performers who are truly deserving. Sometimes the two coincide, but this is very rare indeed. Every time I think of Oscar’s 1985 snub of “The Color Purple” I must admit that I get a little misty, and that is just one in the long line of Academy disses. The Academy has not made much ground this year, which is particularly ironic considering this year’s theme is “Women in Movies.” Oh well, what are you going to do? All I can do is sort through this year’s nominees and try to pick the best of the crop. May the Force be with me!

Best Actor: Robert Downey, Jr., Chaplin; Clint Eastwood, Unforgiven; Al Pacino, Scent of a Woman; Stephen Rea, The Crying Game; and Denzel Washington, Malcolm X. The three top contenders for this award are Eastwood, Pacino, and Washington, but I suspect the competition will boil down to a face-off between Pacino and Washington. Washington deserves to win this one without a doubt (and anyone who saw Malcolm X would tell you the same), but the Academy will probably go with Pacino since he has been passed over eight times already (for much better roles too). However, the recent revelation about some illicit doings on the part of Scent of a Woman producers in regards to Pacino’s Golden Globe win could provide a backlash against him. This one might actually be an interesting race this year, but who knows for sure?

Best Actress: Catherine Deneuve, Indochine; Mary McDonnell, Passion Fish; Michelle Pfeiffer, Love Field; Susan Sarandon, Lorenzo’s Oil; and
