**Rejoice, Davidson: Jim Murphy Appointed to NCAA Management Council**

By Brian Harbin, Sports Editor

Rejoice, Davidson—the Wildcats are going to the NCAAs. Well, one of them is, at least. The 12 member schools of the Southern Conference have appointed Davidson Athletics Director Jim Murphy to represent the conference on the NCAA Division I Management Council, an esteemed 49-member administrative body comprised of athletics administrators and faculty representatives empowered to formulate policy and make recommendations to the Division I Board of Directors.

“Doing the Council’s work is a very detailed and participative process,” said Murphy. “But it’s one that I’m anxious to get involved in, not only for Davidson but for the entire Southern Conference as this conference continues to establish a strong and respected voice among the NCAA membership.”

Murphy replaces Appalachian State professor Dr. Alan Hauser, who has represented the Southern Conference on the Division I Management Council since the Council’s inception in 1997. “It’s been a very interesting and positive experience,” said Hauser. “The Management Council has a great deal of power and influence within Division I. This body has a lot of responsibilities.”

The Management Council oversees Cabinets responsible for academic affairs, eligibility and compliance, budget and finance, championships and competition, and strategic planning. Those Cabinets report to the Management Council, which comes to process all changes to the Division I manual—in effect, the rulebook that governs all of Division I college athletics. The Council meets three times a year—January, April, and October. Murphy’s term will begin following the conclusion of the January 2001 NCAA Convention. He will attend his first Council meeting in April in Indianapolis.

“I’ll be there to represent the perspective and interests of all 12 Southern Conference schools as we all try to compete in NCAA Division I athletics, which itself is a very diverse mix of schools in terms of enrollment and resources,” said Murphy.

“He’ll do a fine job,” lauded Hauser. “He’s a careful and thorough worker. And he will pay a lot of attention to the Conference’s interests.”

Murphy, a 1978 Davidson graduate, returned to his alma mater in February 1996 as Director of Athletics following a stint as executive associate athletic director and chief financial officer for the Georgia Tech Athletic Association. Since 1996, he has overseen a host of capital projects and scholarship programs, including the Bryan Scholars, one of the most comprehensive student-athlete scholarship programs Davidson has ever offered.

Prior to his appointment to the Management Council, Murphy served a two-year term on the Division I Budget and Finance Cabinet. “I gained a lot of experience during that term,” said Murphy. “With that kind of experience inside the NCAA administration, I’m confident about undertaking this new role and these new responsibilities.”

**What’s in the Hotseat?**

Among the most daunting and immediate issues that Murphy and the Council will face in the coming months is amateur deregulation. According to current NCAA rules, any player who leaves college—or skips it altogether—to play a professional sport forfeits his or her college eligibility in that sport. For example, a high school pitcher who signs with the L.A. Dodgers cannot play collegiate baseball if he ever enrolls in college.

A movement, however, has arisen among the NCAA membership to change those rules so that an athlete can remain eligible to play collegiate athletics even if he or she joins a professional team before going to college. The idea behind the movement is to encourage professional athletes who have never earned a college degree to return to campus and finish their studies. But while Division II administrators have already approved deregulation with a few stipulations, skepticism about the proposal lingers throughout many Division I conferences, which believe that deregulation would only invite unscrupulous deals between professional players and college athletic programs.

“Our Conference will need to take a really careful look at the possible hidden implications of this,” said Hauser. “I’d say there is a good deal of anxiety about this proposal from many other Division I conferences.”

**Stars ’N Bars**

Also on the Council’s radar is the ongoing debate over the Confederate battle flag. As a conference whose membership includes five schools (College of Charleston, The Citadel, Furman, Wofford, and Georgia Southern) located in states where the Confederate flag remains a prominent symbol and an intensely divisive issue, the Southern Conference has become more actively involved in the Confederate flag debate than most conferences in the country.

“I assure you the Southern Conference will continue to be involved as the debate moves into Georgia,” said Murphy. Last year, the conference went on record in support of removing the battle flag from the flagpole atop the South Carolina Statehouse dome. Commissioner Alfred White notified the South Carolina General Assembly that the conference would relocate the 2001 men’s and women’s championship tournaments slated for Greenville, S.C., if the legislature did not remove the Confederate battle flag from atop the capitol building.

In July 2000, after years of wrangling among legislators and the NAACP, the state legislature passed a resolution to remove the flag from atop the capitol and feature it in a Confederate memorial on the Statehouse grounds. The Southern Conference will go ahead with its plans to have Greenville host its 2001 basketball championships and preparations are already underway for championship weekend, but now the focus has shifted to Georgia, whose state flag incorporates the Confederate emblem.Confederate ‘battle flag. FOOTBALL STUDY. A study of Division I football also has a place high on the Council’s immediate agenda as the NCAA launches a multilateral committee to study the current state of college football. The study, due to be completed in 2003, will consider, among other issues, membership classification, escalating costs, and the quality of the postseason experience—but will not include any discussion of a Division I-A playoff. “The NCAA study has been commissioned to evaluate the current ‘arms race’ in intercollegiate football and to develop possible alternatives to slowing it down,” said Murphy. “Division I-AA schools have no chance to compete with the amounts of money being spent at the I-A level.”

An underlying concern among Division I-A programs is the recent increase in migration of programs from I-AA to I-A. Some administrators, including Murphy, favor dropping the “A” and “AA” classifications, leaving simply an inclusive Division I football league. Again, the Southern Conference has a substantial stake in this discussion. The Conference has established itself as a Division I-AA leader since 1981 when the NCAA restructured Division I football and reclassified the Southern Conference’s eight football-playing members to Division I-AA. The Southern Conference boasts the best winning percentage in the history of the I-AA Playoffs (.627) and has won seven championships. “Division I-AA football, I think, is a looming issue right now, especially for Southern Conference members,” said Murphy. “I think the question of where I-AA football fits within the broad scheme of NCAA competition is a question that will be coming up again and again.”

HOOPS RECRUITING. Murphy also will likely spend some of his time helping to untangle the mess that is basketball’s summer recruiting season. The NCAA wants to mitigate the undue influence that agents, shoe companies, and camp directors have come to impose upon the recruiting scene, especially in the form of financial contributions to camps and summer tournaments. Charged by the Division I Board of Directors in the fall to develop a new summer recruiting model, a subcommittee of the Division I Basketball Issues Committee already has developed a four-pronged approach that “strengthens the certification of summer events, maintains a summer evaluation period, enhances the important role of coaches and attempts to restrict what has been called the unseemly influences on the game,” according to Gary Brown of the NCAA News.

But some conferences and administrators question whether the NCAA should even involve itself in the situation. Some argue the Association should remain proactive and work to clean up the glaring problems, while others insist that the NCAA should not impose any kind of oversight. This recent work by the Basketball Issues Committee, however, indicates that the NCAA is, at least for now, opting to get involved and help restructure a recruitment program that Hauser calls “a mess.” Commenting on the Basketball Issues Committee’s proposal, Murphy said, “My guess is that [the Basketball Issues Committee’s proposal] will make the recruiting process more expensive for smaller programs since we will need to cover more ground to see the same number of high school players since the large summer showcase tournaments may be eliminated or reduced.”
