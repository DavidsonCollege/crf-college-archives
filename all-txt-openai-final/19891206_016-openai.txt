Health Professions Scholarship Program

Helping To Reach A Goal

Reaching your professional goal to become a physician or medical specialist can be a difficult task financially.

The Navy can’t make medical school any easier. And it can’t give you more hours in the day. But, if
you qualify for the Navy Health Professions Scholarship Program it will relieve you of the financial burden of your medical
education.

If you're a student in, or have been accepted to a school of medicine or osteopathy, accredited by the American
Medical Association or the American Osteopathic Association, you may be eligible to apply for this scholarship program.

The Navy pays:
- full tuition
- school required fees and expenses except housing and meals
- reimbursement for cost of required books and equipment
- rental fees for microscopes
- a monthly cash payment of more than $700 directly to you (subject to taxation and Social Security withholding) to
use as you please

These Navy physicians enjoy working in a group practice environment with many other outstanding physicians and specialists.

BE THE DOCTOR YOU WANT TO BE. IN THE NAVY.
