CROP gears up to help the hungry

By Carrie ARTHUR
News Editor

On November 8, Davidson students, faculty, staff, and local people will gather for the CROP walk. While 25% of the earnings benefit the local Loaves and Fishes and Senior Nutrition Center, the other 75% will help international hunger relief organizations.

Co-chair of the campus CROP organization, Brooke Wheeler ‘01 anticipates that approximately four hundred people will participate in the walk. Nearly two hundred fifty people have already committed to the 10K walk around the town of Davidson, and Wheeler expects that each walker will raise around $80 each. Among the walkers, local churches from Davidson, Huntersville, and Mooresville will send members. Some freshmen halls will also walk together as a group. Although participants do not need to turn in their forms and money until November 21, they must register before the walk. Wheeler encourages walkers to ask professors, classmates, businesses, and even people door-to-door for small donations, and she stressed, “every little bit counts.” For the walk, Warner Hall is selling t-shirts, and interested people can contact Alicia Shelton at x6110.

The other main campus fund-raiser is the weekly CROP lunch, which occurs every Thursday from 11:30 AM to 1:15 PM in the 900 Room of the College Union. At the lunch, students, faculty, and staff eat rice, beans, and cornbread for a small donation. Normally, CROP earns $30 to $40 from the lunch, and Turner’s sponsorship one week produced the largest earnings at $50. So far this year, the lunch has raised $300. With the “even flow” and relatively “same turnout” for the lunch, Wheeler wants “to see more turnout at the CROP lunch,” and she sees advertising as part of the achievement of the goal. Proceeds from the lunch also go to local and international hunger organizations.

CROP is part of the Church World Services, which works to raise money for hunger awareness and relief as well as to assist communities, facilitate disaster relief, establish a people-to-people network, and aid refugees. The Church World Services itself consists of a council of churches in the US as well as churches in 70 other countries. Wheeler and her co-chair Lacy Garcia ‘01 work with Frances M. Daniel, the head of CROP in the Southeast.

The motto of CROP is “we walk because they walk,” and all of the money CROP raises goes for food. Last year, the Davidson CROP walk raised $2,081, and approximately 400 people participated.

Wheeler encourages anyone who is interested to contact her at x6232 and brwheeler or Garcia at x6110 and lagarcia.
