**Lake Campus drowning**

Yancie Adams, 54, of Charlotte drowned in the Lake Campus swimming area near the floating dock on June 25. Lifeguards Jeff Dillard and Joanne MacConnachie were on duty.

Adams was with a group from the Watkins Trucking Line Company who had reserved the lot. Sheriff’s deputies commented that Adams was a poor swimmer and had a history of heart problems. Red Cross instructor John Martindale, EMT Bill Gupton, and an unidentified woman performed CPR and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation until the ambulance arrived.

Robert Shackleford pleaded guilty on August 28 to the shooting of junior Joe Leman at the 12 March 1981 traditional “Hattie’s Night” party.

**Prof MacCormac receives grant**

Philosophy department chairman Earl MacCormac has received an Interdisciplinary Incentive Award from the National Science Foundation. The award is for developing a measurement system that utilities commissions could use in setting rate increases to various customers.

Dr. MacCormac, who is taking a year’s leave of absence, will be working with NC Utilities Commission chairman Bob Koger. Increasing construction of nuclear power plants such as Duke Power’s McGuire plant makes the study important.
