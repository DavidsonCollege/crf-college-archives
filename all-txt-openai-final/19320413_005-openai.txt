Fresh Tie Charlotte, 2-2, in Hurlers’ Duel

The Davidson Wildkittens played Charlotte High to a 2-2 tie Friday afternoon at Independence Park. The game was called at the end of the ninth because of rain and darkness. Bub Mulligan, of Charlotte, engaged Ashton in a hurlers’ duel in which Mulligan got a little the best of the argument. Ashton held his opponents scoreless until the third when, with two men out, Diehl singled to center and then Captain Morris hit one to deep left field for a home run and Charlotte’s only runs. In the eighth, Bumgarner, Johnny Mackorell, and Shrimp Morris secured singles to give the Wildkittens their two runs. Throughout the contest the Davidson infielders gave their pitcher all they had in way of support.

Wildcat Golfers Suffer Three Defeats on Trip

A battered Wildcat golf team returned from an invasion of Georgia and South Carolina with a lone scalp to their credit, that of Furman’s Purple Hurricane, whom they defeated, 18-0. Georgia, Georgia Tech, and Emory all administered decisive beatings to the local linksmen. In the first match Emory jumped on the Wildcats, and sent them down, 13-5. The match was played over the course of the Druid Hills Country Club in Atlanta. T. P. Caldwell at No. 4 was the only winner for Davidson. The ’Cats next encountered the Golden Tornado from Georgia Tech over the sporty East Lake Club terrain, Bobby Jones’ home course, and came out on the short end of an 11-7 score. The match was featured by Captain Jack Wagner’s victory over Tech’s No. 1. Wagner tallied a medal 77 to take scoring honors for the afternoon. In the closing matches of the trip, Davidson showed a complete reversal of form on successive days, being blanked by Georgia the first day, and taking an 18-0 victory over Furman the next day. Captain Wagner again had the low medal.

Debaters Win

Riley Powell, Leland McKeithan and George Pardington have returned from a debating tour. While away the team met Bucknell University and the University of Virginia. The subject of the debate was Resolved: “That Congress Should Enact Legislation Providing Centralized Control of Industry.” The debate at Bucknell took place April 7th.Before the Lewisburg Rotary Club, the club voted in favor of the Davidson debaters. Out of 18 debates that Bucknell has participated in this year, they have only lost two, both to Davidson. On April 4th, Davidson debated the University of Richmond, and this contest was decided in favor of their opponents. George Pardington acted as an alternate debater.

Darlington Loses to Freshmen on Courts

Davidson's Freshman tennis team defeated the Darlington School netmen here last Saturday by winning every one of the six matches played. All the singles matches except one required three sets to determine a winner. The match between Brown of the Freshmen and Grier of the visitors was the most thrilling. The results:

Singles—Brown defeated Grier 3-6, 6-3, 6-3. Elvery defeated Bell, 6-4, 6-3. Phifer defeated Rumble, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4. Coit defeated Bryson, 5-4, 5-7, 7-5.

Doubles—Brown and Elvery defeated Grier and Bell, 6-1, 6-2. Phifer and Coit defeated Rumble and Bryson, 6-3, 6-3.

Conscience has no more to do with gallantry than it has with politics—Richard B. Sheridan.

INTERCOLLEGIATE ITEMS

Cleveland, Ohio—(IP)—Leaving a chemical mixture in a glass retort while he stepped for a moment from the laboratory in the Western Reserve Medical Building, Dr. Theodore T. Zuch of the medical school faculty returned to find the room in flames. He called the fire department. A “brilliant flash” which set off the fire did damage estimated at $2,500. Firemen wearing gas masks fought the blaze.

Columbus, Ohio—(IP)—Six student members of the Scarlet and Mask, Ohio State University musical comedy club, were suspended last week as the result of an alleged conspiracy to evade the eligibility rules. Rumors were prevalent on the campus that the club would be forced to suspend activities for a year. Dr. George W. Rightmire, president, would neither confirm nor deny the rumors.

Manistique, Mich.—(IP)—When 441,000 pounds of dynamite were set off in a quarry here, a faint record of the explosion was obtained on the seismograph at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. The distance cross-country between the two points is 735 miles. Seven miles of TNT fuse were used to set the blast off all at once for the purpose of aiding scientists to record it. The real purpose, however, was to dislodge 1,250,000 tons of limestone, a year’s supply.

New Haven, Conn.—(IP)—In the future, Yale should pick its athletic coaches without regard to where they graduated, the Yale Daily News declared editorially recently. “There is no reason,” the News said, “why a graduate of Yale should make a better coach than a non-graduate.” The News criticized the university for its alleged attitude in thinking it could prove its football was not over-emphasized merely by pointing to the maintenance of its alumni-coach policy. “There is little or no connection between the Alma Mater of the coach and over-emphasis,” the News said. As a matter of fact, the paper said, the alumnus coach might feel he had to win his game with Harvard at any cost. “A good coach,” the editorial said, “is a coach who can inspire men with ideas of good sportsmanship and who knows that football is not everything in the player’s life, and who develops a moderately successful football team. In other words, a good coach looks at football in a sensible light.”

Mexico City—(IP)—When the entire student body at the government’s Indian agricultural school at Chapingo went on strike as a protest against new methods of study, the university immediately advertised for a new student body. The more than 400 students declared they would not return to their classes unless the reforms were abolished.
