#### Undecided About Whether To Apply For Hall Counselor Or Go Abroad? Well, Here's Some Advice

#### The Chance To Experience A People Hall Counselor Experience Establishes Relationship of Trust And Understanding
By Prem Manjooran

Halfway through the year, I assert that my junior year as a Hall Counselor has been my best year at Davidson. As I skimmed the list of next year’s Hall Counselors posted outside the Dean of Students’ Office, my thoughts flew back to that single searing flash of illumination as, with my dinner sitting heavy in the pit of my stomach, and my pulse threatening to choke my tonsils, I ripped open the envelope in the Post Office. I actually screamed my exultation. (This is probably a good time to apologize to the old gentleman who thought I had won the Sweepstakes, and was ready to put in his bid for a sporty red BMW!)

Indeed, I had won a prize, but it was a prize that I have been unable to put a value on. My experiences this year have made me realize the importance of mediating the conflict between the boundless nature of human aspiration and the limitations of time and space. I have learned the value of stepping back and objectively evaluating personal strengths and weaknesses. The implications, and the repercussions, of a total personal commitment to the individual well-being and welfare of a diverse group has been a revelation. The ability to get along with people and to establish a reciprocal relationship of mutual trust and understanding with little or no background knowledge has been honed. The knack of maintaining one’s equilibrium and retaining a sense of humor at 3:45 am (when inebriated summons rouse you from a dreamless abyss, as a precursor to imminent, violent regurgitation), has almost been elevated to an art form. I have developed variations in negotiation techniques and diplomatic skills as the buffer between irate administration and freshman frolic.

And as I step back again, it is clear that I have not had a single bad experience on my hall. In fact, the hall has invariably been a place of refuge. Secure in the knowledge that you are indeed among friends who wish nothing but the very best for you, the hall is the fold into which any form of retreat is perfectly acceptable. I expected to enjoy this year, but so far, the year has surpassed my every expectation. I am going to come out of this year having made friends that I will be proud to acknowledge for the rest of my life. As much as we seem to have put into our hall, my roommate and I have been repaid—it now seems that we are the ones that are indebted for the gifts of unqualified friendship, unconditional support, affection, trust, and respect. And I do believe that I speak for all the Hall Counselors: Thank You Freshman Halls for a wonderful year. The Class of 1995 is at hand. Enjoy.

#### Inside Charlotte
#### Blowout, The Queen City's New Night Club Spot
By Rob Kelley

What? A new club? I was looking through the latest issue of CREATIVE LOAFING when I saw the ad. THE BLOWOUT...The Only Club Designed for Live Rock ‘N’ Roll!...Thursday, January 24...COLLEGE NIGHT...FREE DRAFT...ALTERNATIVE MUSIC...$3/College ID.

Below was an address I recognized from a former club called WEEKENDS, which was active in the early eighties. Unfortunately, with that club, the typical age of the clientele (14-18) and the seediness of the area (the Cinema Blue X-rated Theatre sat not fifty yards away) eventually killed all success.

I arrived at the club at about 12:15 am Thursday night. Located in the back corner of a dark shopping center, the storefront was dark except for a thin light from the double doors and a neon sign on the roof: BLOWOUT. Looking to my right, I noticed that the Cinema Blue had been boarded up.

Inside I saw all the makings of a nifty alternative club. It was multi-leveled and multi-roomed, with black walls, orange-and-yellow neon strips, and a dance floor surrounded by white columns and chess-board floor patterns. Very, very nifty. The bathrooms were especially interesting, painted all in black, with glow-in-the-dark handprints on the walls and footprints on the floor.

And yet, for all its alternative potential, the club was hampered by one thing: the people there. Though no more than thirty inhabited the large dance floor, all were young and clean-cut, and none were dancing. The guys had delicate white faces, turtlenecks, braided belts, and very clean rugby shirts. I saw one guy, apparently a young businessman, in white broadcloth and a silk tie. The women, their girlfriends, reminded me of two Snow White dwarves: Sleazy and Giggly. I got the impression these kids were from UNCC, but this confused me greatly. I know a number of people at UNCC, and they do not look like these did. The attendants were most like a small minority, I decided, probably a fan club for the equally young band, who were talented, but still seemed to be playing to the converted. (By the way, I’m sure UNCC is going to take this the wrong way. Please understand, I’m complimenting you here!)

I danced for a while, but found that NIKE cross-trainers don’t cross over into choreographic maneuvering. Bo don’t dance. On my way out, I ran into the club manager, Charlie Guiducci. We talked a bit about the club, which he told me had opened four weeks ago.“The whole inside was redone and repainted,” he said proudly. How does he see his club fitting in with the others? “We’re located closer to UNCC... we’re planning to give those students a lot for their money.” Unlike other clubs in Charlotte, Guiducci plans to focus primarily on local, Charlotte bands. “The only live rock ‘n’ roll club in Charlotte. Alternative on Thursdays, rock ‘n’ roll on weekends.” He explained further. Mix tapes, while employed, would only be used to fill gaps within sets. Two bands would play each weekend night. It was unsure whether Thursday would always host bands continually. 

While an interesting idea, I can’t see this strategy to be of much use to Davidson students. We get more than our fill of bands through the Court and the Union, and we’re better off by the filter they provide. Secondly, the type of people frequenting the club that night were not particularly lively. Still, if you recognize a band that’s playing, The Blowout is an ideal place to see them. And the club has definitely not found its final audience. If you find an Alternative Thursday (College Night) without a band playing, you might want to bring along four to six friends and grab the dance floor.

Is Different From Our Own
By John Patton

Some of you thought I was crazy, and some of you understood. When I decided to forego the opportunity to be a hall counselor, it wasn’t an easy decision. It was a personal decision in the sense that each person has his or her own goals and aspirations to guide them. I did it for the chance to see a culture and experience a people that is entirely different from our own. I had spent three years working on the Russian language, and this would provide me the chance to practice. Most importantly, the decision forced me to look at my future, and Russian was in that future. Thus, the more I thought about it, the easier it was for me to decide.

When I decided to apply for hall counselor, I did so because I wasn’t sure whether I would have the opportunity to go to the Soviet Union. When I heard in April that I had such an opportunity, I had already been a future hall counselor for two months. I had been to meetings with other future hall counselors and to the retreat. The more time I spent with these people, the more I became excited. Being a hall counselor is a great way to become an integral part of the Davidson College Community. So why did I go to Moscow? I can tell you it wasn’t for the relaxing atmosphere, the food (mostly potatoes and beets), the warm weather, or the social opportunities. 

Finally, the changes in Europe and especially the Soviet Union were too fascinating for me to forego the opportunity to see them. What it comes down to is what’s right for you. There’s no right or wrong, but only a better or a less better depending on each person’s preference. Being a campus leader and helping freshmen deal with college life versus living in another culture are the issues to be weighed. One creates the occasion to have an immediate impact on freshmen’s lives and the other lays the foundation for future goals. It is not a right/wrong question, but a matter of personal opinion.

Music Review
By Joe Binns

The Hobo’s watch stopped at five o’clock
I fear I’ll never find him
Dear John where are you
I know you're out there somewhere
I’ve got a hurricane in my pocket
But no one will believe me
They poured a bucket of tar on top of a flower
Somehow I knew they'd try it...
-“Let’s Go Dancing”

Turn the garbage above into Dr. Bliss. “F.” No doubt. But rock ‘n’ roll doesn’t have to be poetry or even make sense and these fragments work well enough as lyrics on Drivin’ N’ Cryin’s fourth release. They make little or no sense when read, but, when sung by Kevin Kinney, the band’s frontman and lyricist, certain words and/or lines will receive special emphasis bringing about a mood or emotion that remains until another is brought about (the best example is the last line of Mystery Road’s “Wild Dog Moon” - “they were just some friends of mine...”).

It appears that the group has fallen into a rut, however. They have become a little mechanized, following their own formula for solid alternative songs a little too rigidly. I am not accusing them of pandering to the mainstream or selling out, but it seems that they are playing it a bit conservatively with this disc.

Every song is in the three minute and 30 second range. Solos are minimal and jamming is negligible. Every song has the same straightforward crunch guitar licks stacked atop the same big drum sound (simple variations of a two-four backbeat). The creativity meter picks up nothing. Not that Drivin’ N’ Cryin’ have ever been pioneers or gone way out on the artistic limb in the past, but variations they did incorporate, even successful ones, did not get a call back for this disc.

The country/bluegrass picking sprinkled on Mystery Road and The Whisper Tames the Lion are gone and the acoustic sections which made Scarred but Smarter seem to have been forgotten. Don’t pay money for Courageous.
