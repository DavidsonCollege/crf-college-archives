**Nixon Looks Like Easy Winner, Will Face Democratic Congress**

By CHUCK GREEN
Staff Writer

**ALABAMA:** Wallace will sweep the state, while the Democratic candidate for the Senate, Allen, closely allied with Wallace, will win.
The Democrats will retain 6, add 2. GOP will retain 1.

**ARKANSAS:** Wallace; Gov. Rockefeller (R) will win; Fulbright (D) will retain his Senate seat. House-3 D, 1 R-no change.

**CALIFORNIA:** Nixon has a strong lead; Senate: Democrat Cranston will win over militant conservative Max Rafferty. House-21D, 17R-no change, GOP
will do well to gain one seat.

**DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA:** Humphrey has a safe lead.

**FLORIDA:** Wallace; Senate race — Gurney (R) over Collins (D). House 8D, 4R — GOP gain of one.

**GEORGIA:** Wallace; Sen. Talmadge (D) will win re-election. House 9D, 1R — Democrats gain one with the victory of former
U.S. Rep. Charles Weltner, who did not run in 1966 because he refused to support Lester Maddox.

**ILLINOIS:** Nixon: a new Republican Governor, Ogilvie, over incumbent Shapiro (D). Sen. Dirksen (R) will retain his seat; House 9D,
15R — net gain of 3 for GOP.

**KENTUCKY:** Nixon: Senate: Cook (R) over Peden (D). House 4D, 3R — no change.

**LOUISIANA:** Wallace: Sen. Long (D), unopposed. House 8D — no change. But Boggs, the House Majority Whip, is in the
fight of his life because of his support for the Administration, but will win.

**MISSISSIPPI:** Wallace; House 5D — no change.

**NEW YORK:** Humphrey: Sen. Javits to defeat McCarthyite O’Dwyer (D). House 24D, 17R — net GOP gain of 2.

**NORTH CAROLINA:** A complete toss-up, with Wallace having the edge, but a possible Humphrey victory if Nixon and Wallace split
the conservative vote evenly. Bob Scott will win the governorship; at one time the campaign could have been described as
a toss-up, but it appears that Gardner's over-aggressive campaign and his ineffective two years in the Congress have turned the
campaign into a throw-up.
- 1st District — Jones (D).
- 2nd District — Fountain (D) unopposed.
- 3rd District — Henderson (D).
- 4th District — Galifianakis (D).
- 5th District — Mizell (R).
- 6th District — Preyer (D).
- 7th District — Lennon (D).
- 8th District — Gilmore (D).
- 9th District — Jonas (R) unopposed.
- 10th District — Broyhill (R).
- 11th District — Taylor (D).

**OHIO:** Nixon; Senate — Gilligan and Saxbe (R) are in a very close one, but Saxbe has the edge. House
20R, 4D — net GOP gain of 1.

**PENNSYLVANIA:** Nixon: Sen. Clark, a leading dove, will edge Republican Schweiker. House 14D, 13R — no change.

**SOUTH CAROLINA:** Wallace, but Nixon is close due to the efforts of Sen. Thurmond. Sen. Hollings (D) will keep his
seat. House 5D, 1R — no change.

**TENNESSEE:** Nixon; House 5D, 4R — no change.

**TEXAS:** Humphrey is given a good chance here if the Wallace vote gains; otherwise, Nixon is the winner; Lt. Gov.
Smith will become governor as he beats Republican Egger. House 20D, 3R — no change.

**VIRGINIA:** Nixon; House 5R, 5D — net GOP gain of 1.

**WEST VIRGINIA:** Humphrey; Democrats may win the governorship, but both candidates seem to be incompetent. House 5D — GOP loss
of one.

**TOTALS**
- Nixon — 32 states with 323 electoral votes.
- Humphrey — 10 states with 135 electoral votes.
- Wallace — 8 states with 80 electoral votes.

**THE WINNER:** Richard Milhous Nixon.

**House of Representatives:** Democrats 229, Republicans 206; GOP gain 18.

**Senate:** Democrats 58, Republicans 42; GOP gain 6.

**Governorships:** Democrats 20, Republicans 30; GOP gain 4.

Crisis, confusion, and frustration have marked this election year. Perhaps the most confused and most frustrated are the generation of
‘war babies’ who are just now old enough to vote. With their two favorite candidates eliminated — one by an
assassin's bullet, the other by a convention which closed itself off physically as well as mentally from their wishes —
the youthful voters of the nation face more squarely than anyone else what Walter Lippmann has called “the hard choice”.
The jokes about voting for Pat Paulsen or Pigasus or Louis Abolafia (the nudist candidate with ‘nothing to hide’) are
growing awfully stale. What is left is the unpalatable choice of one of three men, each of whom, for one
reason or another, generates fear of the consequences of his leadership. So with only 11 days until the election, there
are still two unanswered questions for many young Americans. For whom am I going to vote and for what good
reason?

**Reputation**

The first question is one of personalities. Someone is needed to assume the charisma which has been absent from the
American political scene since 1963. But there is no one in sight. There is a “new Nixon” to be sure,
but no one is quite certain if he is the “real” Nixon. The reputation of past political mistakes follows him
despite a truly professional job of covering up. There is an “independent” Humphrey who claims he will not be tied
to the mistakes of the administration.

**ED NOTE:** Because THE DAVIDSONIAN was unable to find a faculty member to write a pro-Wallace piece, the following is
an attempt to present Wallace’s views based on Wallace campaign literature.

George Wallace is the people's candidate. The people who feel they have had nobody. He is a populist candidate who
seeks to offer to the electorate what it has not gotten from the two major middle-of-the-road parties.

**‘Politics Of Joy’**

By WILLIAM E. JACKSON

Obviously, the first test for any new president will be his ability to wind up the Vietnam war. Those who
argue for a Republican victory assume that Nixon will have a better chance of accomplishing this than Humphrey — but
that is no more than an assumption. I would like to put the question bluntly to those who support Mr.
Nixon: What is Nixon’s plan for getting us out of Vietnam? So far he has been “Richard the Silent” on
this question. The answer, of course, is that Nixon has no plan — but he wants you and me to
think he does. Hubert Humphrey has some specific proposals for peace in Vietnam that move beyond Administration policy. He recently
called for the cessation of all bombing of the north, period, as a step toward peace.

What about the claim that Nixon can most effectively govern in 1969? The debts that he owes are almost all
on the conservative side of the Republican party. Just how high a price has been paid to create the facade
of Republican unity that underlies Nixon's claim to effective leadership? In what coin do you pay a demagogue like Strom
Thurmond? But there is another, and more fundamental question, I believe. Though a President in part governs through his party,
he must also — to be effective — rise above it. The capacity for personal leadership that strikes a responsive
chord in the people is independent of party strength or party unity. What this means is that the selection of
a president must rest pre-eminently on the judgment of the man, not of his party.

In conclusion, the important issues in this campaign:
1. I must return to Nixon's choice of a vice-presidential running mate — a man who will be one life
away from the Presidency if Nixon is elected. To put the question bluntly: do we want Spiro Agnew to be
vice president of these United States?
2. Secondly, I invite a comparison between Humphrey’s approach to George Wallace and Nixon’s approach. Mr. Humphrey is attacking Wallace
for what he is — a hate monger feeding on the dark midnight of the American mind. Mr. Nixon, on
the other hand, simply says that Wallace cannot win.
3. Then there is the issue of law and order. Nixon criticizes the Supreme Court and makes proposals that have
already been effected by executive orders or laws. Humphrey, on the other hand, talks about order and justice. He understands
that there cannot be justice without just laws and there cannot be meaningful order without programs to eliminate injustice in
this land.
4. Finally, there is the issue of the peace of the world. One of Mr. Nixon’s most irresponsible acts to
date was his call for postponing Senate ratification of the treaty that would prevent the spread of nuclear weapons to
non-nuclear countries. He said that the Senate should postpone action because of the Czech crisis and the Soviet intervention there.
Humphrey has made it clear that he is for the vigorous pursuit of arms control negotiations to slow down the
arms race and to cut free some of the vast resources now tied up in defense budgets.

If the issues discussed above are considered important, then I suggest that DAVIDSONIAN readers go to the polls on November
5, and vote for Hubert Humphrey and Edmund Muskie. Even in this election year — especially in this election year
— it matters!

**Election — 1968**

**OCTOBER 25, 1968**

**‘Law And Order’**

Liberty is a balance. And the white working man is threatened when that liberty balance is upset. It is he
who must live in the cities. He's the man who takes the loss. You ask for understanding? Live poor white
for a while. Have your children go to inferior schools while the country's lament the state of the Negro in
America and draft blue-collar families’ sons to fight.fight a foolish war? Wallace does not appeal just to the “law and
order” theme as he is so often accused. Does he talk about it any more than either of the other
candidates, or do the news media just make a bigger show of it? He has proposed a 60 percent increase
in Social Security benefits. His platform plank on education recognizes the need for continued federal aid to education. Are these
pigheaded? His policies as governor were liberal — funds for education, mental institutions, and other state services were increased. The
Wallace contention that it is time that government efforts be exerted toward the development of more home-based industry in the
South is one that should be given credit... neither of the other major candidates has spoken up for such a
program. All of these are forward-looking proposals — yet all smothered by the same hysteria that white liberals try to
tag on the Wallace supporters. Some people have confused Wallace's intent with his rhetoric. Knowing that he must appeal to
a certain part of the electorate to win a victory, Wallace has engaged in all manner of hyperbolic, crowd-pleasing rhetoric...
a style not uncommon in the American political experience. But like all good politicians, Wallace knows, unlike the purists of
the Barry Goldwater genre, that politics demands flexibility. He knows that the President must constantly take the nation’s political pulse
if he wishes to exercise any power at all. It is understanding that Wallace has told aides and reporters that
if elected he will quickly move to reassure the Negro population. Wallace admits that his plea for “law and order”
is one which would become only a “moral leadership" of the White House if he were elected. Can the President
do more than that? Is oppressive legislation really a possibility with a Democratic-Republican Congress? Another disturbing misconception regarding Wallace has
arisen among “enlightened” college students and professors and other intellectual groups: the whole character and ignorance attributed to many of
the Wallace supporters has been posited on George Wallace, the man and the candidate. How would Nixon and Humphrey fare
if they were assumed to be men of the same character as some of their supporters?

The only real charismatic personality in the campaign has been George Wallace. His success more than anything else reveals the
widespread frustration which undercuts the entire campaign. He has led almost 20 percent of the nation’s lower and middle-class citizens
to believe that they can have a voice in national affairs, but the other 80 percent remain alienated by his
ugly record of segregation. The selection of vice-presidential candidates is equally unexciting. In order, the Presidential candidates have chosen a
“fourth-rate hack politician” (George Ball's description of Spiro Agnew), a Maine Senator with a liberal voting record guaranteed to smash
the already tottering Solid South, and a retired Air Force general who once advised bombing Vietnam “back to the Stone
Age.” Though Edmund Muskie seems clearly the most qualified man to be vice president, he is so unfortunate as to
be on a ticket which would have been far behind no matter who was chosen.

If none of the personalities of Campaign ‘68 stand out, at least America's young voters should be able to make
their choice on who presented the issues in clearest focus and offered the answers which seemed most likely to lead
to solutions to the sickness of the society within or the weakness of its relations abroad. Everyone has talked about
peace, law and order, and national unity, but no one has convinced the American people that he, and he alone,
can achieve these three goals. These have been the three major issues of the campaign. Unfortunately, they have been posed
in an impossible context. They have been approached in terms of what can be done in the next four years.
One fact, however, has remained hidden, and no candidate has had the courage to reveal it — even if he
realized it. That fact is that there simply are no four-year answers. The issues are those which must be faced
for another generation, not just for another administration. The domestic issue of law and order is just the surface manifestation
of a much deeper and more complex problem. The real issue is how our society can be restructured without disintegrating
in the process. There has been no comprehensive plan for accomplishing such a goal — only suggestions and ideas randomly
inserted here and there.

The Presidency is “the vital place of action” in the American political system. These words of Woodrow Wilson are even
more true today than they were in his own time, and they direct our attention to the central issue of
this campaign year: which of the candidates will be most likely to give us the energetic and effective leadership we
must have? The answer for 1968 seems clear — Nixon's the one! The first order of business for the new
Administration must be Vietnam. Even those who began that unhappy adventure now agree that we cannot go on paying its
high cost. There are too many other important problems which demand our attention and our resources. Humphrey sincerely wants to
end the war, despite his enthusiastic support of it in the past. But his close identification with its errors makes
it virtually impossible for him to accept less than a clear victory. No settlement which will be possible any time
in the near future can be made to look like a victory. Nixon has a clear advantage: he can blame
the unattractive aspects of a settlement on the previous administration. Humphrey would have no one to blame but himself. Any
settlement in Vietnam likely to be available soon would probably destroy Humphrey politically. Yet a failure to get some relief
from this burden would be equally disastrous. Nixon would be free to get us out of Vietnam; Humphrey would not.

Once Vietnam is off our backs, we face a perplexing array of problems here at home — most of them
concerning the crisis in our cities. Humphrey offers compassion, but no new ideas to deal with these needs. Nixon's statements
reflect the most recent insights — citing men like John Gardner and Daniel Moynihan. He recognizes that more money from
Washington, although it will be necessary, will not solve the problem. The involvement of talents outside of government, and campaigns
directed at changing attitudes, are part of Nixon's program. Nixon can draw on the enthusiasm, energy, and ability of a
long list of Republicans, which includes almost all of the men who have attracted favorable notice in Congress and in
state and local government in recent years. Humphrey would have to form his administration from the very group of men
who now sit in Washington, frustrated and exhausted by their labors and failures in the Johnson years. The very success
of Nixon’s campaign in contrast to Humphrey's amazingly poor showing argues for Nixon's probable superiority in the Presidency itself. No
job is comparable to that of the President, but that of a candidate comes closest, and success in the campaign
is a good omen for a successful administration. The country needs a change. The failures of the Johnson-Humphrey administration have
been painfully obvious to all of us. To believe that Humphrey, with the assistance of the same familiar faces from
the cabinet and staff, could provide the new ideas and new energy we need requires a credulity inappropriate to the
serious business of electing a president. But an administration combining the enthusiasm and ability of Rockefeller, Romney, Scranton, Percy, Brooke,
Lindsey, Evans, Dillon — and so many others — would give the country the renewed confidence it needs to face
the serious problems ahead. Who can provide such an administration? Nixon's the one!

The issue of peace is not simply the issue of what to do about Vietnam. Granted that the new administration's
first task will be to extricate itself from the Vietnam quagmire as soon as possible, but the overriding issue, the
one which has been ignored, should be how to avoid other Vietnams. The problem is one of translating national interests
into a system of priorities for foreign policy decision-making rather than being forced, time and again, to crisis decisions in
a policy vacuum. With this overriding issue, no candidate has as yet come to grips. The key to solving the
two problems inherent within the issues of peace and law and order is finding a solution to the third issue
— national unity. The chief task of a new administration will be to gain enough of the people's trust and
confidence so that it can begin the task of organizing a new foreign and domestic policy while at the same
time facing the predicaments certain to arise because of the old policies. For the young voters, the choice is especially
significant for they must choose the leader who will broach the task which only they can bring to a successful
conclusion. It is indeed a hard choice; one can only hope that it will never again be so difficult.
