**Wildcats Bow to Blue Devils in Annual Turkey Day Tilt After Three Wins in as Many Seasons**

Davidson Scores in Second Quarter With Trick Offensive But Powerful Duke Backfield Nets Seven Touchdowns—48-7

The Duke University Blue Devils, laden with salt, pepper, fire and brimstone, journeyed down to the lair of the Wildcats
for the annual Turkey Day party and cooked their Thanksgiving goose under a pile of red-hot coals, 48-7.

Long gains were few, but plays netting four and five yards came with uncanny regularity through the central part of
the Davidson line, and these consistent plays wrought havoc with the Wildcat hopes. Jankoski, heralded as great, was bottled up
well by the linemen of the Presbyterians, but having their eyes focused on this lone Duke man, they let the
remainder of the backfield do all that he could have done in driving the line and gaining laurels by playing
great football. Jan carried the pigskin upon many occasions, but each time the Wildcats pounced upon him as though they
were inspired. A gain of nine yards was the greatest distance that he could cover at any one time.

But there were others in that backfield that proved to be terrors, whether they were heralded widely, or not. Buie
drove through many times for gains that gave him a total far above the other members of the team. Upon
many occasions he carried the ball twice in succession and first downs were registered up on the scoreboard. He was
little more successful in his day’s work than was Hollingsworth, who played a great game for Duke and supplemented the
work of Buie in a great style.

In one point, the Davidson team reached a (Continued on page 8)

**Davidson Team Retires With Records Balanced**

Crippled But Hard Fighting Squad Hibernates After Plowing Thru Heavy Schedule

Thanksgiving saw Captain Dick Grey and his Red and Black teammates make their final bow and the curtain fall on
the 1927 football season. A large crowd packed Richardson Field to capacity to witness the Davidson finale with the Duke
Blue Devils, and although Captain Dick and his boys were outclassed, brilliant plays completed by both teams made the game
very entertaining and exciting. The thing that has made Davidson a big drawing card all season, the fact that the
Wildcats have been an unknown quantity and are liable to do anything on the field, again drew a large crowd
over which a spirit of expectancy hovered the entire game. That the Wildcats were beaten is no disgrace, that they
played hard and clean all the way through is much to their credit.

Looking at the season of 1927 from the standpoint of the championship season of last year, the colors of Davidson
have been lowered, but the 1927 season has brought out enough bright spots to make any Davidson man proud of
their fighting machine. After taking Citadel into camp in the opening game with a 5-0 score, the Wildcats furnished the
first upset of the Southern season by decisively defeating the Florida ’Gators in their back yard. The Florida boys then
dug in to defeat Alabama among others, and make Davidson feel all the more proud of her victory. (Continued on
page 8)

After a fast opening half that left the Wildcats at the little end of a 14-7 score, the Blue Devils
started a terrific brand of line plays that were of the most consistent type.

**Dec. 9 Set as Date for Address Features “Phi Beta Kappa Initiation”**

Initiation of Four Nine Alumni and Five Students to be Received in Public Initiation

Phi Beta Kappa will hold a public initiation at 8:00 p.m., December 9th. The special speaker of the initiation is
Dr. David Robertson, one of the trustees of the National Board of Education, and a man who will prove to
be a speaker capable for the occasion.

October 28th issue of The Davidsonian as having accepted bids to Phi Beta Kappa, the national honorary scholastic fraternity, Prof.
K. J. Foreman, secretary of the North Carolina Gamma Chapter, states that the acceptances of two more men have been
received. These two men are Dr. H. Stokes Monroe, of Charlotte, and Mr. Clifton Murphy, of New York City. Dr.
Monroe, who has a son in the present freshman class, is a graduate of the class of 1899. After his
graduation from Davidson, Dr. Monroe secured his M.A. degree from the Jefferson Medical College. He has been a physician in
Columbus, Ga., and Charlotte, N. C., for several years.

Mr. Murphy, after his graduation from Davidson with the class of 1913, became a student of law at Harvard University.
After graduation from the law school, Mr. Murphy taught for a few years in Asheville, but soon joined a prominent
law firm of New York City. These two men were tendered bids upon the regular bid day, but due to
extenuating circumstances their acceptance has been but lately received. Mr. Murphy has been in Europe and has only just returned.

It will be remembered that of the twelve men who had already accepted their bid only five of them are
students. Among the members of the students are D. H. Howard, H. B. Arbuckle, C. G. Davidson, J. S. Gray,
and J. S. McAlister. Those other than the students who received and accepted bids are, Dr. F. W. Rankin, of
Rochester, Minnesota; (Continued on page 3)

**I. R. C. Convenes**

The International Relations Club held its regular bi-monthly meeting Friday night, November 25th. This was the first initiation meeting of
the year. The following men were taken into the society: Thomas Hill, Fred Ratchford, Lawrence Dumas, and B. W. Dickson.
Dr. McConnell was the speaker of the evening. His subject was the Geneva Conference. He began his discussion with a
review of the Washington Conference called by Coolidge two years ago. Dr. McConnell pointed out the fact that this association
was arranged to offset the unpopularity gained by the Republican party in not joining the League of Nations. The United
States made a serious mistake in agreeing to the 5-5-3 plan of battleship disarmament with no provision for cruisers and
good, of submarines. This was considered the only possible way of breaking up the alliance between Japan and England. However,
with no light naval craft limitation arranged, the agreement did little good. The object of the Geneva Conference was to
remedy this lack. England rejected this proposition because she taught for a few years in Asheville, but soon joined a
prominent law firm of New York City. These two men were tendered bids upon the regular bid day, but due
to extenuating circumstances their acceptance has been but lately received. Mr. Murphy has been in Europe and has only just
returned.

**Reporter Selected as Correspondent**

In compliance with a decision made at the recent semi-annual meeting of the North Carolina Collegiate Press Association the staff
of The Davidsonian has selected Dean Rusk as press correspondent for the paper. In this capacity Rusk, who has had
quite a bit of previous journalistic experience, will take care of Davidson’s part of the newly formed Collegiate Press.

The Collegiate Press, which is modeled after the Associated Press that serves large newspapers in all parts of the United
States, is designed to furnish interesting news to all the college papers that are members of the organization and in
this way to arouse interest and to advertise the schools. This system will consist of a press correspondent from the
staff of each paper; this correspondent will accumulate all the news of interest in his college and will mail it
to the press correspondents of the other college papers in the state. Because of the difference in the dates of
publication of the papers this news must be collected as fast as it accumulates in order that it may be
fresh and interesting.

The originator of the idea of a collegiate press in North Carolina is H. L. Hester, of Duke University, who
is now general manager of the association. This organization is said to be unique in (Continued on page 5)of Cotton

Davidson Names All-State Squadron

The time approached when sporting editors are the butts of frequent invectives and various railings and rantings from supporters of
the teams. The time of year has now come to make that most mythical of all selections, the all-state team.
The present season in North Carolina is probably more muddled and confused than it has ever been before. State has
a clear claim to the title, but aside from this, the situation is rather vague. For instance, Wake defeated Carolina,
Davidson tied Wake Forest and was severely trounced by Carolina. Or another, State defeated Duke by the narrow margin of
two points and then defeated Carolina by a larger score; in turn, Carolina defeated Duke by three touchdowns. And this
has been the general trend of affairs during the entire season. State, as champions, and Duke, as runners-up, carry off
honors in this selection, each placing three of their men on the mythical selection. Carolina and Davidson have two apiece,
and Wake Forest one. Probably some will claim prejudice in the selection from here with two Wildcats on the team,
but this will be explained later. The selection follows: Ends, Childress (State) and Arrowood (Davidson); tackles, Phelps (Wake Forest) and
Thompson (Duke); guards, Nicholson (State) and Ferris (Carolina); center, Schwartz (Carolina); quarter, Due (Duke); halves, McDowell (State) and Grey (Davidson);
full, Jankoskie (Duke). There have been four, possibly five, ends in the state this year worthy of particular mention. Childress
and Arrowood were (Continued on page 2)

Winston-Salem Pastor is Speaker at Vespers

Alumni of Gastonia Hosts to Wildcats at Recent Banquet

The football team of Davidson College won the state title in 1926 and were feted extensively by local Davidson alumni
associations in all parts of the state. Davidson's team finished this season in the cellar position among the Big Five;
but this has in no wise lessened the number of banquets planned for the Wildcat gridders. Instead, it seems to
have increased them. The first banquet for the vanquished Wildcats was arranged by the alumni of Gaston County, and was
given last Saturday evening in Gastonia at the Armington Hotel. The speakers at this banquet were the following: Hugh Query,
Dr. J. P. Matheson, S. A. Robinson, W. R. Sparrow, Coaches Younger and Tilson, F. L. Jackson, Prof. W. W.
Wood, Captain Dick Grey, Dr. Glenn, and Ernest Milton. Davidson alumni residing in Salisbury have planned a second banquet for
the team at 7:00 o'clock Saturday evening, December 10th, at the Dutch Lunch. In addition to the team itself, the
coaches, the college quartet, and those Davidson students from Salisbury and Rowan County have been invited. An attempt is being
made to secure S. C. Williams, of Winston-Salem, an alumnus of Davidson in the class of 1905, as the speaker
of the evening. Mooresville alumni have invited the team to be their guests at an early date. The Charlotte Alumni
Association is also planning to honor the Wildcats, which makes a total of four banquets for them, state champs of
1926 and tail-enders in 1927.

Meaning of a True Christian is Theme of Dr. Foster’s Talk—Dr. Hood Introduces Speaker

“What does it mean to you to be a Christian?” asked Dr. J. S. Foster, pastor of the First Presbyterian
Church of Winston-Salem, in an address delivered before the Y. M. C. A. in Shearer Hall, Sunday night. Dr. Frazer
Hood, in introducing the speaker, declared that he was one of the foremost thinkers in the Southern Presbyterian Church, and
should therefore be especially interesting to college students. Dr. Foster in the opening part of his speech spoke of the
familiarity of the term “Christian,” and then proceeded to show what it meant to the Apostle Peter. “Ye are partakers
of the Divine nature; ye are to be partakers of the Divine suffering and the Divine glory.” The length and
breadth of the Christian life is compassed between partaking of the nature of God and of sharing in His glory.
It is a challenge to every red-blooded man to be a sharer in suffering as well as in reward. Even
as Jesus Christ shared in the suffering for God, so we can share in the suffering for Christ by living
the highest, holiest, and most matchless life rather than one of self-abasement and self-effacement. The speaker then pointed out that
Christ's most severe suffering was not when He was maltreated before Pilate. His hardest trial was spiritual and not physical,
and came on the Mount of Transfiguration. Here Jesus must have been tempted to avoid the cross by ascending into
heaven along with Moses and Elijah. Had He yielded, there would have been no resurrection and no real hope of
salvation in Christianity. (Continued on page 7)

Nine Debates Arranged by Members of Council on Extensive Schedule

Five Teams to Represent Davidson in Nine Clashes

DIFFICULT SCHEDULE

Protection of Capital Invested in Foreign Lands is Subject of Discussion

A debating schedule, believed to be one of the most extensive ever undertaken by a Southern college or university, has
been arranged for the Davidson College debaters and was announced by Henry T. Powell, president of the Davidson Forensic Council.
The schedule embraces two extensive tours for the Davidson orators, one in the East and another through the South. Both
trips are scheduled for the month of March. In addition to the ambitious two tours, the Davidson debaters will engage
in three home encounters with representatives of the leading colleges of the nation. Five members of last year’s debating team
are still at Davidson and will automatically become members of the squad. From a long list of students who have
registered for the preliminary try-outs to be held December 8th, ten other debaters will be selected. Various tests will be
conducted to determine which of the fifteen men shall comprise the varsity team of ten members. All try-outs and assignments
will be under the direction of the forensic council. After consultation with representatives of the colleges included on the Davidson
schedule, the query for the debates has been decided upon as follows: “Resolved, That the United States should cease to
protect by force of arms capital invested in foreign lands except by actual declaration of war.” The schedule as announced
by Mr. Powell includes debates with the following colleges and universities: March 13th, University of Florida, at Gainesville, Fla. March
15th, University of the South, Sewanee, Tenn. (Continued on page 5)

Inspecting Officer to Come Here Soon

Davidson’s R. O. T. C. Unit will be inspected some time before Christmas holidays for the purpose of being recommended
for inspection in the spring for the Distinguished Rating which the unit has held for the past two years. The
inspector will be Maj. Harry J. Malony, commanding officer of the Fourth Corps Area. Major Malony is the temporary commander
of this corps area until Maj. R. C. Holliday, of Camp Lewis, Washington, takes charge in February, 1928. Colonel Rowell,
who has always been a great friend of Davidson, has for the past two years inspected the unit and recommended
it for inspection by the staff from the War Department. He was removed to the Pacific coast during last summer
and will not be in this section this year. Davidson has held the Distinguished Rating for the past two years,
making the highest percentage of efficiency in the Fourth Corps Area including the Southeastern States. The unit shows many improvements
over last year, according to officials. The weekly platoon competition for the best line on parade has so far resulted
in a tie for first place between the first platoon of “A” company and the second platoon of “B” company.
Lieutenant Lowrance is in command of the first platoon of “A” company. Lieut. R. A. Gidnn has charge of the
“B” company platoon.
