Cuba, from page 4

was submersed in a foreign country with relatives he barely knew. Now he is in the middle of a horrible
political battle and is constantly hounded by the media and local Miami leaders. Elian has suffered more in his six

that his mother died to secure for him. He deserves it.

The author is a freshman from Miami, Florida.
