**Cat Nips**

**On becoming true blue**

By Jason Byassee

It was 1984, and I was ten years old. My dad drove my brother and me to the University to see our first college basketball game. The team wasn’t supposed to be very good, but they were local so we felt obliged to go at least once. Their record was something like 11-17 the year before, so maybe we were really hurting for something to do over Christmas break. Dad bought a program and we sat down at midcourt in about the tenth row. After some scrutiny, he said, “Looks like this Dawkins kid is their star. He averaged almost 20 points a game as a freshman last year.”

“Dawkins” was one of the names that the rest of America’s basketball fans and I would be hearing a lot in the next few years. The others were Alarie, Henderson, Bilas, and Krzyzewski. That 1983-84 Duke team was Coach K’s first to enjoy a winning season. Johnny Dawkins and company would go on to knock Michael Jordan and North Carolina out of the tournament, and a few years later would bring Duke to the Final Four in Dallas. You know the rest. Seven Final Fours in nine years, the chance for a third championship in four years tonight, etc.

My fanship of Duke began that night in 1984 and has only been interrupted by my attendance at Davidson. Hoping it’s not sacrilegious, I have tried to wear both Duke blue and Wildcat red for the past two years. Despite my column of a few weeks back, I pray the two will never actually meet in a real game.

I vividly remember watching Duke beat Temple to go to the 1988 Final Four, with Billy King suffocating Mark Macon into a disastrous shooting performance. I recall Phil Henderson dunking over Georgetown’s Alonzo Mourning for a trip to the 1989 Final Four. There was Christian Laettner’s 1990 shot to beat UConn for a trip to Denver, the blowout at the hands of UNLV in the championship game notwithstanding. Actually, the ‘90 loss made the ‘91 rematch and championship all the more sweet. My friends and I drove over to Durham and ran around bonfires that night, savoring such images as Grant Hill’s dunk over Kansas in the Finals. It seems like a lot of my Blue Devil memories consist of Duke guys dunking over other guys.

The 1992 season was supposed to be the greatest of the glory years in Durham. It was. Duke’s two losses that year came when Bobby Hurley had a broken foot, and Laettner’s shot against Kentucky...

**Baseball avoids sweep**

By David Dwyer

Davidson and East Tennessee State staged an offensive war over the weekend, combining for 75 runs over the course of 23 innings. In two games which wouldn’t be classified as “pitching duels,” Davidson batted in 11 and 12 runs and held the lead for much of the second game. Ultimately, however, ETSU swept the Saturday series and left town with a pair of conference victories.

The afternoon’s first game set the tone for the offensive barrage, as ETSU jumped out to a 6-0 lead over the first two innings and held on for a 15-11 win. In the second game, however, it was Davidson that drew first blood, battering ETSU starter Todd Armstrong for four runs in the first inning. Jeff Andrews’ opposite field drive cleared the fence for the first run, and after Armstrong loaded the bases, senior Paul Brannon drove in two runs with a one-out single. Freshman Brad Edwards scored the inning’s final run after an error by the ETSU catcher.

Davidson starter Clay Hall held ETSU scoreless into the third inning until ETSU first baseman nailed the first of his three homers and batted in the first two of his seven RBIs. By the bottom of the...

**Golf has first loss**

By Neil Marks

The golf team lost their first match play of the season to Big South power Winthrop College last Thursday at River Run Country Club. Fighting the wind throughout the day, the team lost an 18-9 decision and dropped to 5-1 on the season.

The Wildcats were led by senior captain Will McDaniel in the number one spot. He was the team’s medalist for the round, shooting an 8-over par 80. The rest of the lineup included Hal Fogleman, Sean Mercer, Kevin Miller, Bob Baily, and Brian Wickendon.

“The match was very competitive and much closer than the score indicated. I was happy with the way we played; we’re improving each time out. Winthrop...has a strong team and will probably win the Big South. We were playing a very good team out there,” said head coach Joe Mark. “We played well, considering the conditions we had to face. The wind made it extremely difficult today,” said McDaniel. The team also competed in the Citadel Invitational over spring break in Charleston, South Carolina. Facing an incredibly strong field from eight states, the Wildcats finished 15th out of 18 teams. Kevin Miller was the team’s medalist with a two-round total of 162. The players will now focus their attention on the conference tournament on April 10-12 in Chattanooga, TN.

In the third inning, Davidson held an 8-2 lead and was looking to slam the door, but ETSU began to chip away at the lead behind Hooks’ second homer. Reliever Brian Heil, who sported a 1.23 ERA through last Thursday's game at Wake Forest, was brought on in the top of the sixth inning, nursing a lead of 8-6. But again it was Hooks, blasting his third homer, this time with two men on, over the right field fence for a 9-8 ETSU lead. But in the bottom of the sixth, ETSU reliever Daniel Ball walked in two more runs, giving Davidson the lead again at 10-9. Again the lead changed hands in the seventh as Davidson surrendered five more runs. Brett Boretti’s solo home run capped a two-run rally effort in the bottom of the seventh, but Davidson couldn’t close the gap. Final score: ETSU 14, Davidson 12. Davidson prevented the sweep with a 13-10 victory on Sunday. Freshman Jon Coulomb made a strong showing on the mound, pitching the final five innings while giving up just two runs for the win. One highlight, however, was pitcher/1B Clay Hall tying the NCAA Division I’s record for putouts in a game (an 8-7 win vs. Appalachian State) with 26. At the beginning of last week, Hall was leading the Southern Conference with a .402 batting average. Davidson finishes its tour of the Southern Conference on April 24 with a series at Marshall and hopes to continue building on a difficult 1994 season.

Women's track and field competes in Wake Forest Invitational tourney
By Jean DeMoss

While many students escaped to sandy beaches and warm weather, the women’s track and field team competed in the Wake Forest Invitational the first weekend of spring break. In the first event of the meet, Stephanie Moses placed fourth in the 10,000 with a time of 39:54. The two-mile relay was the highlight of the meet. Led off by Marie Grisez (2:24), she handed off to a neo-800m runner, Maria Whitehead (2:26). Fresh Legs Sallie Permar ran the third leg (2:30), and sophomore Phuong Nguyen (2:27) brought the relay home. The relay team smashed the old school record.

After two weeks of training, the team competed on Saturday at UNC-Charlotte against Wake Forest, Campbell, Winthrop, and UNC-Charlotte. Perfect weather conditions graced the thinclads and they dominated many events. In the jumping events, Davidson crushed the opposition. Maria Whitehead won the triple jump, Lara Burkholder won the long jump, and Vanessa Sims won the high jump. In the field events, Erika Gromelski competed in the discus, javelin, and the shot put. She put the shot over 30 feet for a personal best.

Davidson had a good day around the track. In the 1500m, Phuong Nguyen finished second place in her heat (5:06), and Marie Grisez followed quickly behind her (5:08). Carolyn Meadows, Stephanie Moses, and Erin Roach rounded out the field. In the sprint events, Vanessa Sims debuted in the 100m and the 200m, and Lara Burkholder continued her assault in the 400m. Maria Whitehead again lowered her time in the 400m hurdles, finishing in third place with a time of 1:08.5. The 800m runners Sallie Permar (2:32), Karen Marshall (2:33), and Annie Parsons (2:46) crushed out two laps around the track.

In the 3000m, Davidson runners dominated the field. Stephanie Moses won the race. She was followed by Erin Roach in third, Jean DeMoss in fourth, Marie Grisez in fifth, Elizabeth Bishop, and Carolyn Meadows also finished for Davidson. The last event on the track was the one-mile relay. Davidson fielded two competitive teams. Smaller than most of the track meets that the athletes usually compete in, Davidson dominated many events and placed well. The team travels next weekend to compete in the Duke Invitational.
