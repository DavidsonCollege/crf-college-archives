feeling to the drums. Adam Clayton finally played with his bass sound, working with distortion and other effects to an
interesting end. Edge’s guitars cover a staggering range of sounds — everything from his classic echo to cutting distortion and
underwater bubble noises. If anything sets the album apart, it’s the atmosphere added through supposedly random noise. It gives the
music a depth most mainstream bands don’t address.

I’m not sure that Pop lives up to Bono’s claim that U2 created a new type of music, but I
do think they have a knack for exploring different sounds and applying them to their style of songwriting. If you’re
married to the idea that a band has to be consistent throughout their career, either sonically or thematically, you probably
won’t like Pop. But if you’ve followed U2 through each of their facelifts and like watching the procedure, buy this
album.

If I’m hyper-critical it’s because I want U2 to earn their place in my heart. I want to be able
to look past the glitz of their new-found, electronic (and arrogant) identity and say, “I don’t care. They make incredible
music.” So far, they’re doing pretty well.
