##### Judith Kalb: Russia’s fascinating culture

By DANIELLE MILES  
Staff Writer

Judith Kalb, Davidson’s new Russian Professor, brings not only new talents but new ideas and new connections to the department. Kalb grew up in Washington, D.C. Before her birth, her father served as a journalist in the Soviet Union, so Kalb’s childhood was characterized by much talk of Soviet culture. Living in an already international area, this parental influence solidified her love of things international, and increasingly, things Russian.

Kalb’s interest in Russia really began to take shape during high school, when her closest friend, who was Hungarian, needed to learn Russian in order to return home. As an undergraduate student at Princeton University, Kalb majored in Russian with a concentration in Russian Area Studies. Last June she completed her joint Ph.D. program in Russian and Humanities at Stanford University. Of her decision to become a professor she says, “I’ve always been interested in teaching... eventually that came together with Russian.”

In 1988 Kalb traveled to the Soviet Union and today says of her trip, “It was a fascinating time to be there when things were changing. People didn’t quite know what was going to happen next. It was a very exciting place to be.” She adds, however, that “there weren’t the opportunities there that there are now... Now we can get.”

##### Suzette Polson: 

By JENNIFER STARR

When reviews and papers loom, many Davidson students can’t wait to get out of college. However, Suzette Polston, Class of ‘91, could not wait to come back. Six years ago, Polston was learning chemistry at Davidson. This year, she is teaching chemistry to the next generation of Davidson students.

Although she is a Davidson graduate, Polston’s college career did not begin here. As the oldest of seven children and the first in her family to go to college, she was initially daunted by the college decision process. She chose to attend the University of Tampa in her hometown. However, she realized that she was not being academically challenged there. After talking with...A friend at Davidson and learning of Davidson’s then-held policy of meeting 100% of financial need, Polston decided to become a Wildcat. As for challenge, “Boy, oh boy, I got challenged at Davidson!” Polston recalls with a laugh. After graduating from Davidson, she began her doctoral work at Emory University in Atlanta. While enrolled at Emory, Polston also pursued her interest in country-western line dancing. She and a few of her friends from Emory were among the 1,500 line dancers who performed in the half-time show of the 1994 Super Bowl. Polston believes her Davidson education prepared her well for graduate school.

Davidson first-hand exposure there [of] an ancient, fascinating culture.” Kalb attempts to share her own experiences in Russia with her students both in and out of class. She started a Russian club that gives students a chance to absorb some of Russian culture through food, discussion, and movies. This club will even take the form of a choir, with the help of Kalb’s husband, Alex Ogden, who directed a Russian chamber choir at Stanford. Of her time here at Davidson, Kalb says, “I’m constantly thrilled by my students... [and] to be in a classroom with that much excitement and intelligence.” She says her door is always open to students and emphasizes that “now is a great time to learn Russian. An American in Russia can always find something exciting to do.”

She says, “After Davidson, the first year of graduate school was a breeze.” She is currently finishing up her Ph.D. in Chemistry and will defend her dissertation this November. Polston decided to pursue a career in chemistry because she sees chemistry as “the marriage of math and how and why things work. I wanted something hands-on and concrete.” She advises students to expect chemistry to be demanding and problem-oriented and explains, “Here [at Davidson] chemistry is a lot harder than at other institutions. Lots of students feel daunted by Chemistry 115... It does require discipline, like any other subject you master it only through practice.”

Polston does not think much has changed at Davidson since she left. The main changes she notes are the new Visual Arts Center and the new Chemistry professors. She finds the change refreshing and believes that youthful professors allow for increased student creativity and input. Her new role as Visiting Professor has given Polston insight into both sides of the Davidson experience. She says, “[As a student], I didn’t realize that the faculty worked so hard. From a student view, I knew I was working hard. I’m impressed to know the general level of excellence.” Polston still feels a close tie to the Davidson student experience. She says, “I still feel like a student. I can’t believe I’m in this office! But it feels so familiar and comfortable. I know this is what I want to do for my career.”
