BOOK REVIEW

Twelve Against the Gods—William Bolitho, Simon and Schuster, New York, 1929.

“Twelve Against the Gods” is the story of adventure. It considers that type of adventure which has produced some of
the greatest characters in the history of mankind. “To us of the white race,” writes William Bolitho, “the adventurer is
the most fascinating of our possibilities. Lucky and accursed, we have the taint of adventure in our blood. . .
. In reality, the whole history of human progress from the flint-jabber to standing room in the subway . .
. is the result of two forms of effort, the guard and the search, made by the homestayer on the
one hand, and by the bold affronter of the new on the other; that is, by the citizen and the
adventurer.”

Bolitho takes the stand that the adventurer is anti-social—that this is a part of his very nature. Perhaps he has
carried this idea too far. However, when we examine the lives of great adventurers, we see that there is some
very definite backing for the idea. In some it is more evident, and in others it is less. It is
upon the all-inclusive side of his statements with which we would argue.

In this study of adventure—and it is essentially a study of adventure—Bolitho discusses twelve great characters. These char-

Cake Race Planned For Frosh Nov. 7th

In order to get more Freshmen interested in track and in athletics in general, the athletic department has decided to
establish here at Davidson a traditional cake race. They feel that a great many boys have the ability to run
and yet don’t realize this ability. Through the cake race, it is hoped that such persons will discover their ability,
or at any rate become interested in some form of athletic sport. These cake races will be held annually for
the Freshmen and a large number of candidates is expected to turn out. Fifteen or more prizes will be awarded,
ranging anywhere from checks, neckties to soda.

The cake race here this year will take place on November 7, and it is hoped that every Freshman not
out for football or not physically disabled will participate. Men are urged to come out now and begin getting their
legs in shape for the two or two and one-half mile course that will start at the stadium, go to
the fourth tee on the golf course, then will follow the road leading to the Concord road, and will take
the Concord road back to the stadium.

A glider club, membership of which will be limited to about24 undergraduates, has been formed on the campus of Carleton
College at Northfield, Minn. Dr. William F. Peirce, president of Kenyon College, has entered a sanitarium at Washington, Pa., to
recuperate from an appendix operation undergone in August. He plans to take a vacation at Hot Springs, Va., before resuming
his duties at Kenyon in December.

What this country needs is more of us with the courage to say “yes” when fools ask: “What's the matter,
are you afraid?”—Collier's editorial.

There are lots of people who committed crimes during the year who would not have done so if they had
been fishing—Herbert Hoover.

Characters are: Alexander the Great—the adventure of youth and how philosophy tamed it; Casanova—he who went furthest into the forbidden
country of extremes; Columbus—who proved that everything is true, if you believe it; Mahomet—the bloody hunt for heaven; Lola Montez—the
only adventure woman of the past could live; Cagliostro (and Seraphina)—the search for a phantom; Charles XII of Sweden—and danger
as an ideal; Napoleon I—the only reason for Waterloo; Cataline—the rich young racketeer of Rome; Napoleon III—the living serial: consequences
of the situation; Isadora Duncan—the dance of life on a tight-rope strung over Europe, and Woodrow Wilson—single combat. Bolitho permeates
his writing with his personality—both brilliant lights on the horizon of a rather dull period. He might easily be called
an adventurer—I hope we may use a different meaning from his. W. S. Lea.

Case-Reserve Merger Not to Be Complete

Cleveland, Ohio—(AP)—Spurning a pointed suggestion of the Reserve Weekly that the Case and Reserve football teams be combined, in keeping
with the spirit of academic co-operation recently announced for the two institutions, whose campuses join here, the Case Tech couched
its reply in the following terms:

“If football is first and last a municipal spectacle, let's merge and be quick about it. If it is a
campus sport, part of a program of ‘every man play his own game,’ why not stay in the Ohio Conference,
where some good friends, Oberlin and Wooster among them, are working with us to advance these ideals? Why not?”

Reserve, a traditional enemy of Case on the football field, has practically deserted the Ohio Conference of late years, in
an effort to bring “big time” football to Cleveland. As a consequence, she has taken terrific wallopings from Carnegie Tech,
Pittsburgh, and similar teams of national strength. Case has continued to keep its schedule mostly in the Ohio Conference, and
looks this year to beat Reserve rather decisively.

MR. RIMMER SPEAKS (Continued from page 1)

...them, the Evangelistic Scriptures.”

Mr. Rimmer also quoted from Tatian’s Diatessaron. Says Tatian, “While I was giving my most earnest attention to this matter,
I happened to meet with certain barbaric writing too old to be compared with the opinions of the Greeks, and
too divine to be compared with their errors. I was led to put faith in these by the unpretending cast
of the language, the inartificial character of the writers, and the foreknowledge displayed of future events, the excellent quality of
the precepts, and the declaration of the government of the universe as centered in one being.”

“The science of archaeology has also found that people living in the early Christian era used in addition to the
papyri, bits of broken pottery for writing material,” said Mr. Rimmer. “Many of these have been unearthed which bear upon
them quotations from the Scripture.”

In closing, Mr. Rimmer made an appeal to Davidson men to keep their faith in the Bible and to believe
in it without reservation.

BETTER TASTE—such as only a cigarette of wholesome purity and better tobaccos can have.
