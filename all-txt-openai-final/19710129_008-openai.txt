That is the issue which Davidson's little-known but highly skilled debate team is prepared to argue from either side. The
debaters sent two teams to the Florida Junior Varsity Tournament, one consisting of sophomore Mark Deininger and freshman John Douglas,
and the other of sophomore Bill Eskridge and freshman Tom Kent. Both teams went 3-3 and Deininger and Kent won
speaker awards. Kent and sophomore Sanford Steelman then went to the Wake Forest Novice Tournament (a prestigious tournament for first-year
debaters) and went 2-4. Eskridge and Steelman went to the University of South Carolina Varsity Tournament and won five out
of eight debates. They went on to the quarter-finals and won a trophy.

**Faculty Ponders Rules Changes**
By RICH WILSON, Asst. Managing Editor

In a special meeting yesterday, the faculty began deliberation on a revised edition of academic regulations reworked and recommended by
the Educational Policy Committee (EPC). For the next two Thursdays, the faculty will continue their discussions on the regulations which
included what one EPC member calls "wide and sweeping changes."

One of the major proposed changes is to abolish the pluses on all grades. This would affect a four-point grade
scale and bring grade points in line with quality points. "The committee seemed to feel that the pluses on grades
were given arbitrarily; there is too fine a division between a B plus and an A," said Danny Clodfelter, student
member of the EPC. Vice President of Academic Affairs John M. Bevan also noted that pluses caused problems in the
use of percentiles.

Another proposed change states that the faculty must announce reviews at least one week in advance. The faculty also would
be responsible for makeup reviews and giving incompletes on grades, whereas previously these functions were held by the Dean of
Students. The EPC proposed that faculty not be compelled to send absences to the Vice President for Academic Affairs at
the end of the term; however, the one-quarter cut policy would still be in effect. "The fact that the cut
policy is not abolished along with the recording of absences is the most irrational thing I have ever seen," said
Clodfelter. "The logic of this policy escapes me."

In the proposed regulations, students may withdraw from the college without parental permission. Previously a letter was needed from the
student’s parents. If these regulations are passed by the faculty, students would also be allowed to choose to take a
course pass-fail without the permission of the faculty member. In other words, the faculty would submit letter grades for each
student and then the registrar would convert any grades into pass-fail. The faculty would not necessarily know who was taking
a pass-fail course and who was not.

Concerning extended studies, the EPC clarified that no faculty member could be responsible for more than two extended study projects
at one time and no more than six per year. Bevan said he hoped the faculty would take final action
on these regulations during the March 2 meeting.

**'Love Story' Evokes Debate On Tearjerkers**
ED. NOTE: The movie 'Love Story' has evoked many different responses so we have elected to run both a pro
and a con review.

By SCOTT DAVIDSON

How does one define sparkling burgundy? Or a rhapsody? They bubble, they soar, and there is something iridescent about their
essence that you can’t quite put your finger on. The long-awaited film version of 'Love Story' carries that iridescent "something."
In its predictable but unpretentious exploitation of romance, 'Love Story' is unabashedly old-fashioned. Boy meets girl. Boy falls in love.Kent
then went to a varsity tournament in Philadelphia hosted by St. Joseph's University. They easily defeated the Princeton University team
and compiled a 4-3 record. The final tournament of 1970 which Davidson debaters attended was the famed Dixie Classic Varsity
Tournament at Wake Forest University. The two teams of Deininger-Kent and Eskridge-Douglas participated. Davidson's first great forensic battle of 1971
will be the Wingate Invitational, where Bill Eskridge and John Douglas will represent the college. The team hopes to be
able to attend at least three tournaments in February; the Harvard Invitational and the Dartmouth Varsity Debate Tournament are possibilities.

Asked what advantage a debate team could be to the college, veteran debater Mark Deininger said, "A well-known debate program
would help Davidson's sagging admissions applications and would, on the average, attract a higher quality student to Davidson." Since the
departure of Marlin R. McMillin, former assistant professor of drama and speech, in 1969, the Davidson debate team has been
without a regular coach. The team officers hope to obtain one someday, but in the meantime, they coach themselves. The
team officers are senior Gray Mason, president; Deininger, first vice-president; and Eskridge, second vice-president. Debaters search each year's topic, drawing
up affirmative and negative cases as they go. Then they try out their evidence and arguments on one another in
sometimes heated practice sessions. Then they sharpen up their arguments and try them out on teams from other colleges, and
reassess their performance after every tournament.

Erich Segal, screenwriter (and author of the novel which, if there’s anyone that still hasn’t heard, came after the movie
version), has lifted this rather Simple Simon formula from the soporific by infusing it with humor, sophistication, contemporaneity, and two
fairy tale-like characters in whose triumphs and woes we can revel. Ali MacGraw plays a snotty Radcliffe music student with
sub-zero social status with a marvelous sense of instinct and timing. It is not so much that she is a
good actress as that she is a completely credible one. She lives a role rather than acting it, existing within
its shell. Ryan O'Neal unveils an acting virtuosity unsuspected in the former darling of "Peyton Place." As the Harvard jock
and scion of a rich Boston family, O'Neal adds a dimension of intensity and sensitivity to Oliver Barrett IV that
was not present in the novel. The music by Francis Lai is occasionally inventive and appropriate and mixed with Handel
and Mozart. Lai staunchly resists an intrusion of rock. Watching "Love Story" is a joyous, exhilarating experience. It is a
treat to see a frankly sentimental, frankly tear-jerking picture that reminds us that life can be admirable and tragic and
that we can still laugh and cower and weep in all its essential humanity.

By DON HAGUE

What can you say about a movie about a twenty-five-year-old girl who died? That it brings back memories of good,
clean, tear-jerking romance to those in the audience over forty? That it gives millions of teeny-boppers a new marriage ritual
(to the dismay, I might add, of bridal boutiques, florists, organists, etc. Did you ever think about the havoc that
is wreaked on the American economy by Hollywood fads?) That it has Erich Segal laughing all the way to the
bank? "Love Story" is not much more than this—while it is always a pleasure to see Ali MacGraw, she does
not really fit her character. Many of her lines are said in such a stilted manner that I felt she,
like me, had read the book too many times. The one exception to this is the scene in the snow
when she said, "I care." For a moment she was Jennifer Cavilleri, in love with Oliver Barrett IV. This passed,
though, and not even her liberal use of the word "bullshit" could make Miss MacGraw credible again. To me, "Love
Story" simply did not portray love. Love is not snow-fights, nor is it neatly tailored tweed coats, nor M.G.s. Love
is more. "Love Story" is not. Can you imagine all the first-dating high school juniors who came out of "Love
Story" in search of their own magic snowdrift?
