1969-70 marked the end of the “glory years”

I have asked many Davidson alums of the 1960s about their experiences in one of the most tumultuous decades of the 20th century. Some have said that small Davidson was often isolated from the decade’s craziness. Others dispute that claim by pointing to several student protests against the Vietnam War. But nearly all of the alumni remembered those days for a completely different reason. Davidson had one of the best basketball programs in the country.

When Dick Snyder and Fred Hetzel packed their bags and headed for the NBA in '65 and '66, Driesell didn’t abandon his goal of making Davidson a national title contender. By 1968, Davidson had not only rebuilt, it had reloaded. That year, the Wildcats had one of their best seasons to date, finishing with 24 wins and advancing to the NCAA Tournament Regional Finals, where they lost their bid for a Final Four appearance to the North Carolina Tarheels. Leading the team was a host of impressive stars like Rodney Knowles, Mike Maloy, Jerry Kroll, and Doug Cook. For the latter three players, this would be the first of three consecutive NCAA tournament appearances. Maloy, Kroll, and Cook still hold prominent places in the Davidson record books.

The story of Maloy might be more interesting than that of Driesell. Maloy was one of the first prominent African-American athletes at Davidson at a time when North Carolina still upheld many Jim Crow laws. Maloy became one of Davidson’s most prolific scorers and rebounders during his three years at the school. In the winter of 1968, Maloy became the first Davidson athlete to grace the cover of “Sports Illustrated.” He was one of three players heralded as “Challengers to UCLA.” By the end of that season, Maloy found himself facing off against the player sitting in front of him for that SI cover shoot: Charlie Scott. At that time, Scott was a star forward for the Tar Heels. He owns the distinction of being UNC’s first black scholarship athlete, yet the history books leave out one important footnote: he wanted to come to Davidson. The legend goes that Scott attended Davidson for a recruiting visit but a local restaurant refused to serve his family because of his skin color. Scott ended up attending Chapel Hill.

On March 15, 1969, Scott left one more indelible mark in the history books of Wildcat basketball. Davidson set a new high water mark in 1969 by recording 27 wins en route to another Southern Conference Championship. After rolling over St. Johns and Villanova in the tournament’s first two rounds, Davidson faced a rematch with North Carolina in a rematch of the Regional Final game from the year before. With under a minute to play and a tie ballgame, Davidson had a chance to use up the clock and hit the game-winning basket. But Kroll was whistled for an untimely charging foul and North Carolina got the ball back. After a timeout, everyone in the arena knew that Scott would be taking the final shot. With the final seconds ticking away, Scott dribbled to the foul circle and put up a jumper. The ball rippled the net as the final buzzer sounded. North Carolina advanced to the Final Four. Davidson’s “glory years” effectively ended.

By the end of that week, Driesell had accepted a new job at the University of Maryland. Although the Wildcats were very successful under replacement Terry Holland over the next two years, they faltered in the 1970 NCAA Tournament’s first round. During that spring, Maloy left school early to enter the NBA but was cut before the season even started. A 1972 “Charlotte Observer” article claimed that nearly all of Holland’s initial success was due to the remnants of Driesell’s recruiting. That same article also noted that many members of Davidson’s faculty were not unhappy to see Driesell leave because they were not pleased by the academic sacrifices that seemed to have accompanied major college basketball. It was time, it seemed, for Davidson basketball to head in a new direction.

Between 1974 and 1991, Davidson had a combined record of 177-301. Davidson briefly dropped out of the Southern Conference in 1988. The program needed a major change. It needed a vision once again. That change came with the hiring of a high school coach from Long Island. The coach’s name was Bob McKillop, and he would go on to become the winningest coach in Davidson basketball history.

Martin, Stegger impressive in early season contests

After strong showings at ECU and Emory, last weekend the women’s swim team, led by a score of freshmen, picked up its first two team wins of the young season against Georgia Southern (166-127) and Wingate (129-86). In the 50 free, Lindsey Martin '11 continued her undefeated season at Wingate, besting her own school record of 23.93 set earlier in the season at Emory witha blazing time of 23.75. Martin’s resumé this year also includes a record-setting performance in the 100 free, a runner-up time of 52.17 at the Emory meet. For her stellar times at ECU and Emory, Martin was named Coastal Collegiate Swimming Association’s Women’s Swimmer of the Week for meets completed Oct. 15-21. Despite her success, it is still easy for Martin to find motivation. “In our meet against Emory, I was out-touched in the 100 freestyle by about a tenth of a second,” Martin said. “Had I beaten her, we would have been 10 points closer to beating Emory. So basically, in practice I focus on not letting that happen again,” she said.

Her fellow underclassman Anna Stringfield '11 won the 1000 free in the Wingate event with a pool record time of 10:35.20. She previously secured wins at Georgia Southern in the 200 free (1:53.85, the second fastest time in team history), 200 backstroke (2:06.47, fourth fastest in team history), and 400 individual medley (4:31.97, fifth best time in team history). At Georgia Southern, Ineke Stegger '11 won all breaststroke events, posting times that rank her eighth in school history for the 200 and ninth for the 100. Madeline Parra '09 won the 200 butterfly and Emily Castle '11 won the 100 butterfly. Kelsey Chisholm '10 also played her part on the diving board, winning both the one and three meter competitions.

“The team is finding its identity...” Merritt Peele '09

At Wingate, Jessica Delgehausen '11 set a pool record in the 200 free with a time of 1:59.94 and touched the wall first in the 100 free with a time of 59.77. On the diving board, Stephannie McKinney '09 won the one meter diving event with a score of 187.82. “The women’s team gained a lot of talent this past year,” Martin said. “With that said, we all work very hard to use what we have to the best of our ability.”

While winless thus far, the men’s team also starts the season strong with multiple individual wins logged in its three events at ECU, Emory, and Wingate. Team captain Fiete Stegger '08 earned Coastal Collegiate Swimming Association’s Men’s Swimmer of the Week for the week of Oct. 15-21 for his fantastic performance in the 100 free; his time of 48.49 ranked second in the CCSA men’s top 16 times. Also at Emory, Stegger anchored the winning 400 relay quartet made up of Merritt Peele '09, Tennant Brastow '11, and Andrew Carlson '09 with a time of 47.62. At Wingate, Scott Frantz '09 won the 100 back in a pool record time of 52.60, adding to two early season wins in the 200 back and one in the 100 back that earned him CCSA Men’s Swimmer of the Week honors for the first week of the season. Peele also continued his winning ways at Wingate, finishing the 1000 free in a meet record of 9:51.33 and adding this victory to his triumphs in the 100 and 200 free at ECU.

“The team is finding its identity,” Peele said. “There are a lot of great freshmen and the team dynamic has definitely changed from last year. As we all learn more about each other and grow together, we’ll only get better and better.” Looking ahead to meets against teams like Duke and Clemson, Peele said, “We’re racing some extremely tough non-conference opponents during the season, but our focus is the conference meet.” Martin echoed Peele’s goal, “My personal goals and my team goals are about the same: work hard to build Davidson’s reputation as a powerhouse despite our size. Oh, and of course, we would really like to win our Conference meet.”
