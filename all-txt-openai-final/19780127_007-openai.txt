Untitled

Morning sun

stretching through window
hits suddenly

my crystal sphere

hanging,
spinning slightly
color marriage is broken
yellows, greens to the corner
reds, blues to the floor
orange hits me in the eyes
purple lingers near blue

reaching up, fingers
spin the color prison
my breath is sucked away
colors chain me
bind me
pin me to the bed
I am motionless, enthralled

time passes

the forever light withdraws its touch,
colors wed again,

the sphere

returns to

stillness but

I am still entombed.
