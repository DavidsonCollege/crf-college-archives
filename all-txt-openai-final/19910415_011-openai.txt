Women's Issues Committee Promotes Equality For All
By Laura Blair

The 1991-92 Committee for Women’s Issues, headed by Bess Murchison and Courtney Nichols, has an informative and innovative year planned.
The main purpose of the committee is to educate the student body about the necessity of recognizing equality for women.
The committee is by no means gender exclusive and strongly anticipates and encourages the participation of men. The committee respects
all degrees of feminism from radical to liberal. They realize that all feminists do not hate men, but many plan
to marry and...Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

have a family. Their main goal is equality for women. Murchison and Nichols stated, “As for the members of the
student body who have expressed such limited tolerance for the concept of feminism, our only response is that people are
most often scared of things they do not understand. We are here to dispel those fears.”

By Caroline Nelson

Each week The Davidsonian spotlights several of the YSSC programs. This week the spotlight is on Davidson Elementary Tutoring and
Habitat for Humanity. Participants in the Davidson Elementary Tutoring program volunteer one day a week to help elementary-aged kids with
their homework. It gives Davidson students the opportunity to interact with children of the community. There will be an end-of-the-year
picnic with the parents and kids on Thursday, April 25th. Get involved! If interested please call: Grey Timberlake at 6024
or Rachel Dunifon at 6299.

Habitat for Humanity needs you! Come help fellow students and the Davidson community build houses for low-income families who could
not otherwise afford homes. We often help with construction, painting, etc. on the weekends and occasionally during the week. If
interested please call: Sarah Egan at 6548, Tara Cox at 6545, or Sharon Cheah at 6297. LEND A HAND!

A recent event sponsored by the committee under the guidance of Sara Carlson was “Take Back the Night.” The main
goal was to promote rape awareness. Over 120 people turned out to hear three Davidson women speak about personal experiences
with rape and sexual abuse. The brother of one of these students also spoke on behalf of his feelings about
his sister’s experience. The speeches were followed by a candlelight walk through the dark areas of campus. After the walk,
the remainder of the group went to hear a speaker from the Shelter for Battered Women. The majority of the
group tied ribbons on a tree symbolizing either their experiences with rape or those of a close acquaintance.

Murchison and Nichols have great plans for the upcoming year. They plan to make “Take Back the Night” an annual
event and to have many prominent speakers visit. Among the speakers they hope to include are the president of the
Charlotte branch of Planned Parenthood and a speaker who will explain how men can become involved in the fight for
sexual equality. There will also be more films and forums. Next week the past leaders of the committee will be
passing out copies of a booklet which will be a handbook of women at Davidson.

In closing, Murchison and Nichols would like to leave you with “an open-ended invitation to participate in any of the
upcoming events sponsored by the Committee for Women’s Issues. Come, talk, and listen. Please come and learn.” The committee has
organizational meetings at 7:00 on Wednesdays and discussion groups from 1:30 to 3:00 Sundays at the Carolina Inn.
