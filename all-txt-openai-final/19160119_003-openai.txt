Y. M. C. A. MEETING. Mr. McCombs, a student of the White Bible School, New York, in his tour to keep in touch with Southern colleges, lectured to the local Association on Thursday, the 6th. His subject was: “Keeping in touch with the world; and keeping in touch with God.” Notwithstanding the fact that the professional course is essential to scholarship, he showed that there was a danger of students growing oftentimes into a sphere quite their own, thereby losing touch with the world. He gave some interesting experiences of how the students of his school kept in touch with the world there. In the second part of his subject he spoke from, “I am the bread of life,” showing that Christ is the only source of spiritual growth. The time to form the habit of getting spiritual strength is in the college days.

The Orchestra has suffered the loss of one of their most promising members, McDuffie, who did not return after the Christmas holidays. The Glee Club has more good material than it can use. The manager of the club is making arrangements for two trips this Spring. Although the details of the trips are not yet known, still it has been definitely decided that one of the trips will be up towards Asheville and the other will be into South Carolina and the eastern part of the State.
