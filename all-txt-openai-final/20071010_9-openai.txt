In last week’s opinion piece, DesPain calls President Ahmadinejad’s Sept 24 appearance at Columbia University’s World Leaders Forum “unacceptable.” What I find unacceptable are his factual inaccuracies. DesPain refers to the Minutemen incident on Columbia’s campus. He is correct in stating that several Columbia students interrupted a speech by Minutemen leader Jim Gilchrist that he gave at the invitation of the Columbia College Republicans. Several protestors went on stage and held up a banner that declared “No human being is illegal” in Spanish, Arabic, and English. As a result, the event had to be shut down.

I was a student at Columbia University for two semesters, including the one during which this incident occurred, and received a campus-wide email from Columbia’s President Lee Bollinger in which he expressed deep concern over the fact that the protestors who had taken the stage had directly violated university policy in the gravest way. Bollinger stated that an investigation into the incident had been started immediately. Eight students were later charged with disciplinary violation. The man who started the physical altercation wasn’t even affiliated with Columbia and has been permanently banned. DesPain mentions none of these consequences; rather, he ends his discussion of the Minutemen incident with: “Columbia is so protective of free speech rights that it does not allow anyone to have them.” How convenient to leave out half the story in order to make such a grandiose assertion.

DesPain claims that the Minutemen do not promote or engage in genocide, racism, or sexism. No one at Columbia ever accused them of doing so. You do not have to promote or engage in genocide, racism, or sexism in order to promote xenophobia. I found on the Minutemen’s website this statement on why they patrol the Mexican-American border: “Future generations will inherit a tangle of rancorous, unassimilated, squabbling cultures with no common bond to hold them together, and a certain guarantee of the death of this nation as a harmonious ‘melting pot’.” This is just one example of the blatant xenophobia the Minutemen perpetuate.

As for Ahmadinejad’s appearance at Columbia, DesPain claims that Columbia legitimized Ahmadinejad by asking him to speak on campus and he leaves out the broader context in which Ahmadinejad’s visit to Columbia occurred. Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA) developed the idea for the World Leaders Forum as the commencement to a year-long examination of 30 years of the Islamic Republic in Iran. Ahmadinejad was far from the only world leader to visit Columbia’s campus in the past several months; he was just the most controversial. As President Bollinger wrote in an email to Columbia students on the day of the event, “[This forum] is an important educational experience for training future leaders to confront the world as it is—a world that includes far too many brutal, anti-democratic, and repressive regimes.” Columbia’s forum enabled future world leaders to confront Ahmadinejad. Had DesPain actually watched the event’s footage, he would have noticed that the questions Columbia students submitted were critical of Ahmadinejad’s practices and beliefs.

DesPain seems to believe that Ahmadinejad should just be ignored; he writes, “It is never necessary to understand a man before condemning him.” Do I think that Ahmadinejad is an abhorrent human being? Yes. Does that mean that I think he should be ignored by the U.S and its institutions? No. I think that mentality is frighteningly close to the mentality that allowed Hitler to do everything that he did. I would much rather see institutions like Columbia force a dialogue.

**Perspectives**

Chinese officials released a joint statement in Beijing this week announcing significant progress in the latest round of the six-party talks with North Korea (DPRK). The deal calls for a full dismantling of the DPRK’s nuclear facility at Yongbyon, disclosure of its secret enrichment sites, and a cessation of all further illicit activities. In return, the North will receive a total of $100 million in fuel aid and other economic concessions, provided it holds up its end of the bargain. North Korea would also find itself off the U.S. list of state supporters of terrorism if North Korea cooperates.

President Bush hailed this agreement as a great success and publicly mused about a similar deal with that other nuclear ne’er-do-well, Iran. Critics, however, have been quick to attack. U.S. conservatives cite Clinton’s 1994 plan as an example of why not to “reward” North Korea for its wrongdoing. That deal gave the DPRK’s Kim Jong Il a special light-water reactor in return for assurances that the North would cease its indigenous weapons program. A decade later, Kim announced that his country had created and tested a nuclear weapon, all thanks to the Clinton bargain. Although holding Kim in good faith doesn’t seem to make sense given his history of deception, this agreement actually makes sense for various reasons. Though Kim may still have some tricks up his sleeve, he is showing more of his hand now than ever before.

First off, far from “rewarding” Kim for his successful test of a nuclear device in 2006, the U.S. and its partners (China, Russia, South Korea, and Japan) are acting out of strategic necessity. Now that the DPRK has formally withdrawn from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and has proven itself a viable nuclear state, the prerogative now is to keep it from acquiring any new weapons. The deal seeks to stop the...10, 2007

Negotiations with North Korea commendable

...bleeding—to find out what’s really going on in Mr. Kim’s backyard before it gets any worse. Though Kim may still have some tricks up his sleeve, he is showing more of his hand now than ever before. This is indeed progress: insight into Kim’s regime is hard to come by, and he may not be in a bargaining mood again any time soon. The North’s possession of the Bomb is a significant deterrent against any future military attack from the global community. Moving on North Korea now would put the 30,000 U.S. troops and 175 million people in South Korea and Japan in grave danger. Engaging the North diplomatically is the smartest, safest, and arguably only option.

The Bush administration’s present focus on diplomatic engagement shows that it has learned a valuable lesson. When coupled with robust contract enforcement, it is the safest, most effective way to deal with intransigent regimes. Military force should never be off the table, but it must always be the last resort in conflict resolution. While keeping Mr. Kim honest will prove difficult, keeping him talking is paramount. Though it may cost a good deal, meeting Iran and North Korea at the table is much better than meeting them on the battlefield.

President Bush is right, for once. This deal sets a good example for a similar one with Iran—but that statement brings both positives and negatives. Iran may have less incentive to open its many enrichment facilities to international oversight since it has yet to attain a weapon. Iran simply has too much to lose. Taking Iran off the state-terror list would, of course, be ludicrous due to the suspected activities of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard in Iraq and Lebanon. Though not all 75 million Iranians are terrorists—as certain Davidsonian columnists have blindly asserted—a small few certainly are. Though it may cost a good deal, meeting Iran and North Korea at the table is much better than meeting them on the battlefield. Military engagement with either would be disastrous. Reaching agreements with both, however flawed, are steps in the right direction.

Ignorance characterizes Columbia article

BRYAN Norris

For the second time in two weeks, Bobby DesPain has written a shallow, offensive, and utterly misinformed article, this time on Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s speech at Columbia University. DesPain makes several interesting observations about the event and the parties involved, utilizing several clever tactics such as gross overgeneralizations and a total disregard for fact-seeking.

First, let’s examine his criticism of Columbia University. DesPain labels Columbia a “left-wing anti-American” institution. This extremely heavy statement makes me wonder whether or not Bobby feels that Columbia graduates Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, Theodore Roosevelt, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt were anti-American as well. What about the university’s former president Dwight D. Eisenhower? I find it hard to believe that the home of the Pulitzer Prize, the birthplace of the Manhattan Project, and an institution that was deeply involved in weapons R&D for the Pentagon is a wholly anti-American body. I do agree with Mr. DesPain regarding the Minutemen protest and think that it reflects very poorly on those who participated. However, to condemn Columbia for the actions of a vocal minority is entirely intolerable.

Speaking of condemnation and intolerance, DesPain’s views on allowing Ahmadinejad to speak are also equally ridiculous. Bobby DesPain believes that Ahmadinejad should not have been allowed to speak at Columbia University, which is a fine opinion. Unfortunately for Mr. DesPain, his reasons for holding this opinion are totally absurd and completely illogical. He writes that “just because Ahmadinejad is the president of a country does not make his words valuable.” A flawed statement at best, although I doubt I can persuade him to change his position on this particular statement. Now, what if we added some more information to his sentence and mixed it up a little. Here goes: “Just because Ahmadinejad is the president of a country [that is actively pursuing nuclear weapons, supporting terrorists in Iraq, and is a threat to American interests, this] does not make his words valuable.” According to this belief, we don’t need intelligence or an understanding of our enemy. We do not need to know how to guard against his strengths or attack his weaknesses. We shouldn’t bother with learning about our enemy’s motivation so that we can discover what his aims are. Hopefully, Mr. DesPain does not want to disregard intelligence gathering; though if he does, I understand, as intelligence has certainly caused the Republican Party a fair bit of trouble lately.

Finally, I would like to discuss Mr. DesPain’s assertion that “It is never necessary to understand a man before condemning him.” Several people have used this declaration as a guiding light in the past. Among them are famous leaders such as Slobodan Milosevic, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, and even Saddam Hussein. Yes, all of these men thought it fit to “condemn” people based solely on their ethnicity. They ignored the potential of and killed thousands of people. It did not matter whether or not the people they were killing were bad, good, or great individuals. They did not care to understand the people they were slaughtering. Mr. DesPain, your statement sounds pretty damn anti-American to me.
