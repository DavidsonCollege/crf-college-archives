OPINIONS MONDAY, OCTOBER 7, 1996 Kristen Richardson

A kiss on the hand would be quite continental...

It is not every day that I am utterly violated by my mail. Of course, there is the aggravation of
receiving stupid mail that you will never read or catalogues whence come no products that you will ever purchase. An
example of this which comes to mind is the weekly Gardener's Eden catalogue. How did they know of my penchant
for topiary and endless free time? Oh well, after almost four years of the same mailbox, I am on every
mailing list I could imagine and some you could not. So brings me to the offending mail: Victoria’s Secret.

Usually, I object to this catalogue on the grounds that their lingerie is manufactured with cheap fabrics, and therefore falls
apart, and that it comes in colors like aqua and lavender. Nonetheless, every woman seems to get this catalogue. Many
order from it. I don’t. Before talking about the specific infraction which provided the impetus for this article, let me
provide some (contextual) crusted brassiere glittered across the cover of the catalogue I just received. That is correct. A diamond
bra. For those of you who have not had the transcendent experience of a bejeweled undergarment, I highly recommend perusing
the Victoria’s Secret catalogue. I forgot to mention that this is also a miracle bra. A miracle bra is the
same as a wonderbra. They push your breasts up so high that you nearly choke. Not to mention that the
level of padding befits football, not l'amour. So what we have really is a pair of diamond football pads.

There are so many ways in which this bra is ridiculous that I won’t go into all of them. I
don’t think that this thing is even worthy of feminist or cultural analysis, so let’s take a voyage into the
mind of the potential buyer. I would say that the target customer is a middle-aged man, newly and conspicuously wealthy,
with nymphomaniacal—possibly megalomaniacal—tendencies. He has a young mistress and a very healthy bank account. He purchases in a flurry of
stereotypically fin-de-siècle decadence and sexual angst. I know that the buyer is not a woman. How am I so sure?
How many women want visibly hard objects to protrude from their chests? If someone gave me a diamond bra, I
would beat him senseless with it. Not to mention what would happen if you lost it or had to clean
it. I can’t imagine you could run it through the gentle cycle or take it to the dry cleaners. Swishing
it in jewelry cleaner isn't really practical either. I guess you could put it on exhibit.

If you can’t afford the bra, don’t be sad. It is not even pretty. Trust Victoria’s Secret to make a
bra for one million dollars and have the damn thing still be ugly. If you do like the look, I
am sure you can achieve the same results with a bra from Target and a Bedazzler™.

Merriam Webster’s New Collegiate Dictionary defines the verb “to haze,” present participle “hazing,” as the following: “to harass by exacting
unnecessary or disagreeable work,” or “to harass by banter, ridicule, or criticism.” The Laws of North Carolina define the term
as “to annoy any student by playing abusive or ridiculous tricks upon him, to frighten, scold, beat, or harass him,
or to subject him to personal indignity” (14-35). Last Monday, each freshwoman was asked to sign a Statement of Consent
Form acknowledging her full awareness of the college Hazing Policy and that she was not to participate in any activity
violating said policy, and even though each freshwoman fully understood that the activities were completely voluntary and would incur absolutely
no consequences or repercussions should she choose not to participate, our well-meaning, group unifying project was don’t hold the same
connotation), but we were told that the grounds for the administration’s displeasure was not the fact that these women were
choosing to participate, but that their participation could cause emotional scarring in laterlife and thus put the college in a
tight legal situation should such a scarred individual decide that their life was permanently marred by a week spent with
goggles on their head and sue for mental anguish. The upperclass women of the Swimming and Diving team were accused
of the above-defined transgression by proposing a week of initiation for the freshwomen of the team. The indicting act had
nothing to do with alcohol, nor did it ask the initiates to perform physical labor of any sort; furthermore, the
perilous request evoked neither ridicule nor criticism of any kind, nor did it place the freshwomen in any conceivable situation
of a compromising nature. No, the Women's Swimming and Diving Team was accused of hazing their freshwomen by posing the
option to them to wear their goggles on their heads around campus. As silly and ridiculous as it might sound,
and as innocent as we intended the activity to be, my co-captain, another team member, and I were told by
quite well-meaning administrators that even though deemed illegal. I am not writing this article to point fingers, extract sympathy, or
vent my anger and frustration with a system whose priorities are severely out of whack. Instead, I’m writing to express
my grave disappointment in a system that refuses to differentiate between healthy situations and harmful ones, and who punishes those
with good intentions for the potential actions of those with detrimental ones. Not only were we forced to retitle our
week of freshwoman initiation “Fun Women’s Swim Team Week” (somehow the two words “initiation” and “hazing” have become synonymous in
the eyes of the administration), but we were also reprimanded for our actions.

I understand the obligation on the part of our friends the administrators to look out for the well-being of each
student, and I, along with my teammates, appreciate them for pointing out our grievous mistake. Furthermore, I would fully understand
the administrative tizzy regarding our little activity if we were actually making fun of the freshwomen, or drawing negative attention
to them, or beating them with their goggles. But since none of these situations are the case, perhaps the administration
should re-evaluate their reactions to innocent, well-intentioned activities and save their energy for those actually deserving it.
