**Student actors deliver in ice-skating comedy Perfect Six**

"I suppose that the most difficult aspect of my character was that I haven’t acted before and learning how to become a character was challenging - especially because my character was such an unhinged ice-princess who was psychotically obsessed with skating." - Elizabeth Sykes

This past weekend, five Davidson students and one professional actress performed Mark Eisman’s new play, Perfect Six. Because the play is a work-in-progress, the actors were given a mere three weeks to prepare their scripts and rehearse as a group; Eisman, in fact, continued to change lines during the final week of rehearsal. The play, presented as a workshop premiere, is a masterpiece in the making that farcically exposes the volatile world of competitive figure skating.

The actors were convincing, passionate, hilarious, and at times scary. Of course, there is the effeminate male skater, Chandlee Caldwell ‘03, who feels that he must prove his masculinity to his unhinged partner, Elizabeth Sykes ‘04, who claims that he ‘throws like a girl’; and the sunny, Southern replacement partner, Rebecca Ragland ‘03, who, unfortunately, is a tad too...

**Final Destination 2 fails to frighten**

Final Destination 2, the sequel to the surprise 2000 horror hit, mistakenly uses excessive violence and gruesome death scenes to extort fear from audiences, and fails miserably. What results is a film that is (literally) laughable.

One year ago, in the events chronicled in the original film, Flight 180 exploded minutes after takeoff, killing all those aboard, including 40 members of a class going to France for vacation. Minutes before the takeoff, Alex Browning envisioned the crash and in a panic, rushed off the plane, taking several friends and one faculty member off the plane as they attempted to secure him. The plane, departing without them, exploded as the students and Alex watched in horror. Subsequently, Death, the Grim Reaper himself, began to attack and kill, one by one, those who were supposed to die in that plane crash and didn’t, thus altering Death’s plan. (If you don’t remember this, the sequel’s opening scene quickly recollects the plot of the original film).

But as the first film offered audiences a unique horror experience as the survivors try unsuccessfully to outrun Death/Fate, a killer they can’t see, the sequel tries to offer a clean and easy solution to avoiding Death’s design.

This time around, Kimberly (AJ Cook), a high school student, begins a road trip with three friends, headed for Daytona Beach for spring break. However, as Kimberly waits on the on-ramp to merge into the oncoming traffic, she envisions a truck causing a major car pileup, in which she, her friends, and several other strangers are going to die tragically. In panic, she blocks the line attempting to merge, saving numerous lives, including her own as she watches the accident happen before her eyes, exactly as she envisioned it. Subsequently, afraid Death will hunt down the survivors of the accident, Kimberly, with the aid of Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), the only remaining survivor of Flight 180, seeks out a plan to overcome Death’s vengeance and protect the fellow survivors of the accident.

Final Destination 2 returns to the trap set by so many bad horror and slasher films of the recent past, relying on on-screen violence in a fleeting attempt to create fear in the audience. The most successful moments of the film occur in the opening sequence as the film depicts the tragic crash and the death of Kimberly and her friends among others, only to blind the audience with a white light, finding us back on the on-ramp, just moments before the car crash. But after an exciting and engrossing opening sequence, the film fails quickly. As the survivors of the accident begin to fall victim to the death they avoided on the road, the deaths become more elaborate, more laughable, and more unbelievable. For example, Evan, a young wild kid, is making some dinner for himself on the stove. On the side of the nearby fridge are the magnetic letters spelling out "Hey E." While distracted, the H falls, leaving E-Y-E, eye. Moments later, a ladder falls upon him, with one leg striking and crushing...his eye. The subsequent death scenes are even more graphic and even more idiotic. But perhaps the fault of the movie isn’t its excess violence and stupid death scenes, but rather the characters themselves. Poorly written, the fellow survivors are annoying, stereotypical characters, the kind that always seem to die in horror films. Besides Kimberly, none of the characters are developed to the point of eliciting sympathy from the audience. If such sympathy had been established, the movie might have been more enjoyable and more frightening.

The director Steve Umberger and a skating consultant successfully transformed ice skating performances onto the theater stage. Ragland and Sykes stunned audiences with their fiery lifts and throws. Skating moves, such as the ‘death spin,’ were difficult to fully understand yet only contributed to the play’s hilarity. According to Sykes, the moves were not terribly difficult. Eisman was impressed with the actors’ ability to learn the ‘skating’ choreography and was especially pleased with Ragland’s strength and proficiency.

Bridged to the skating plot is the intriguing love affair between Annie Wadman (‘06) and James Flieder (‘03). Wadman plays Caldwell’s sister who, while working as a motel housekeeper and junior college pre-med, falls in love with and loses her virginity to a Southern motel transient (Flieder). Flieder’s character is the Phillip Morris heir and is obsessively addicted to cigarettes. His character is especially poignant amid Davidson’s North Carolinian audience. Wadman connects the entire plot through her relationship with Sykes’ mother (professional actress Claudia Covington) and history with ice skating. Wadman, a freshman, is surprisingly confident on stage and succeeds as the play’s center character.

Both Sykes and Wadman were new to Davidson’s acting stage. During an interview, Sykes admitted that she originally thought that she would be an art major; however, after taking a theater 101 course, her decision of major turned to theater. Sykes was the set designer and costume designer for The Memory of Water and will be the assistant stage manager and master electrician for Angels in America, Part I: Millennium Approaches. Although new to the Davidson stage, Wadman acted throughout high school. The other actors starred in performances such as The Memory of Water and Cabaret.

Would I ever wear a unitard again? Sadly, no... if I were asked to wear one for a character in performance, perhaps. But by requests from friends, no.

I still am wondering where Liz Sykes found the courage to dance across a stage, in front of an audience of family, strangers, and friends, while wearing a bright purple unitard. All actresses must be ebullient and self-confident (and, after witnessing many of Liz’s apartment Rent performances, I know that she possesses both characteristics), as well as willing to ‘skate’ across an imaginary ice rink while pretending to be fanatically crazy.

Return of Sardonic Irreverence

Cool
Wacko Jacko interview... King of Pop turned formerly-ethnic villain du jour. Not quite journalism, which made it frightening and exhilarating all at once. Watching MJ feed his baby: worse than eating horse anus on Fear Factor.
Tracy Morgan and Horatio Sanz... Make SNL worth watching. Tracy and Horatio on why we should legalize drugs: “They use hemp for making rope.” Yes, they do.
Glam Rock... Year after year, the Court’s most fun party. Cheers to PiKA, unceiling and all.
Davidson basketball... Kicking butt on live television. WOO-HOO!
Oscar nominations... Best nominations: Selma Hayek (Frida), Diane Lane (Unfaithful), and Julianne Moore (Far from Heaven) for best actress. They’re all great, but I’d go with Lane. Also, Spirited Away for animated feature.

Not Cool
Unprotected sex, jean shorts, your mug shot on the local news... Never have been and probably never will be cool.
J.Lo and LL... He represents Queens; she was raised out in Brooklyn. Nope. She’s still, she’s still Jenny from the Bronx. A cross-borough catastrophe. Poor Jenny, walking down the street in tears, Louis V bags on every limb. Really, really lame.
Dave... At forty bucks a ticket, he better be naked.
Joe Millionaire: NOTHING happened on this week’s episode. Almost makes me want to boycott the finale. Almost.
Oscar nominations... Worst nomination: The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers for best picture. Biggest oversights: Y Tu Mama También, Far from Heaven, 13 Conversations About One Thing for best picture; the supporting performances of Alfred Molina in Frida and Kim Staunton in Changing Lanes; Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets for visual effects.
