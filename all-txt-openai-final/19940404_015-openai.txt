Women's tennis stands 3-1 in So. Con.

By Tracy French
Heading into two weeks of tough Southern Conference play, the women’s tennis team has a 10-5 record overall and a
record of 3-1 in the Southern Conference. Their only conference loss was to Furman, the leader in the conference, but
the team feels they can challenge Furman in the future.
“We are performing well, right where we should be," said head coach Caroline Price, "We feel like we have a
solid lock on the number two position in the conference. Although in our head-to-head competition Furman won 8-1, we felt
we were competitive at six of the nine positions. So we feel that with a few adjustments we can position
ourselves for a run at them at the Southern Conference championships April 15-17."

The team has had great competition this year playing seven schools in the top 100. They have also had significant
wins this season, including wins over Georgia Tech and Connecticut.

Over spring break the team lost to the College of Charleston 6-3. The Wildcats then traveled to Hilton Head, SC,
to play Wichita State, who is ranked number 45 in the country. “Our goal is to be in the top
one hundred at the end of the year, so for us to lose to them by only 5-4 is excellent,”
said Price.

The next match over spring break was against the University of Connecticut, whom the Wildcats beat 8-1. The team then
travelled to Greenville, SC, to face Furman and UNCC before returning home. The Cats lost to conference leader Furman, but
bounced back to take a convincing 7-2 victory over the 49ers to end the break.

Last Friday, Davidson defeated ETSU 7-2 for their third conference win of the season in a match that was supposed
to be tough for the Wildcats.

Five team members only have one singles loss in conference play: Kimberly Nance, Nicole Wilcox, Jennifer Beahm, Natasha Ruth, and
Susannah Cobb. Two doubles teams also only have one conference loss: the teams of Cyndi Hess/Kimberly Nance and Nicole Wilcox/Susannah
Cobb.

Coming up this week, the Wildcats will face Virginia Tech on Tuesday, Appalachian State on Wednesday, and then two more
conference matches this weekend with Georgia Southern on Saturday and Marshall on Sunday. Friday, April 15, the Wildcats begin the
Southern Conference Championship, which Davidson will host for the second year in a row.

Men's tennis wins seventh in a row

By Patrick Jopling

With a 5-1 victory over UNC-Charlotte Thursday, the Davidson men’s tennis team won their seventh match in a row and
improved their overall record to 13-5. Leading the charge has been junior Dan Grinnan in the number four singles position.
He has defeated all of his Southern Conference opponents (6-0) and has won his last eight matches.

With the Wildcats holding a 5-1 conference record, they have found themselves in a tight race for the conference lead
after rebounding from an early season loss to Georgia Southern. Along with Davidson and Georgia Southern, Furman and East Tennessee
State have solid teams and impressive conference records.

The Wildcats will face East Tennessee State this Sunday here at 1:00 p.m. in a critical match for Davidson in
the conference race. Before Sunday’s match, the Wildcats will face Belmont Abbey on Saturday in a match that will be
played exclusively by the eight seniors on the team.
