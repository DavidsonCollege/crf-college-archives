> THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER 25, 1933 SUCCESSFUL HOME- COMING PROGRAM ALUMNI MEETINGS TO BE HELD HUNDREDS OF ALUMNI RETURN Former Students Are Present for Annual Homecoming Program Davidson-Duke Game is High Light of Day’s Schedule ALUMNI LUNCHEON HELD Crowd is Satisfied With Showing of Wildcats (Homecoming Story is on Page One) An estimated crowd of from seven to eight hundred alumni returned to the campus last Saturday for the annual Homecoming program. Groups of former students, some of whom had not been on the campus in many years, started drifting into the town of Davidson Friday, and a steady stream continued until starting time for the game Saturday. Many left immediately after the game, but others stayed in Davidson until Monday. Much of the time was spent visiting familiar spots about the campus, renewing acquaintances in the village, visiting professors, and taking part in the program that was planned for them. Taking defeat with more applause than does victory, the Wildcat football team proved to the old grads that it was a true Davidson team, with the familiar Davidson spirit and merits. No alumnus went away dissatisfied with the showing made by the team against a heavier, more experienced, and more powerful Duke team. The spirit that never says die carried the Red and Black machine to a touchdown after it seemed that there was no chance, and the members of the squad, facing men who were fresh from the unlimited strength of the Methodists, fought until the last whistle. Following is a partial list of the alumni who returned for the game: Albert McClure, ‘31; J. M. Ramsay, ‘01; Ernest A. McKee, ’88; Chas. G. McKee, '95; Watson Falls, '33; A. H. Stone, '33; B. R.

Coaches Interviewed On Varied Broadcast The fifth in an indefinite series of radio programs sponsored by Davidson College was held last Wednesday night under the direction of Alumni Secretary Grier Martin. Mr. Pfohl, of the music department, entertained with two cornet solos, Coaches Newton and McEver were interviewed, and Kenneth Scott rendered a piano selection. Mr. Pfohl opened the program with the cornet solo, “Love Song,” by Victor Herbert, and concluded his part of the broadcast with the number, “Tramp, Tramp, Tramp,” by Goldman. Mr. Martin then interviewed Coaches Doc Newton and Gene McEver with regards to the Homecoming battle with Duke. Newton's remarks consisted mainly in a comparison of the great Alabama team of 1930 with the Duke team of this year. Coach McEver spoke of the great power Duke needed to win from Major Neyland’s potent Tennessee eleven, and the hard game he expected from the Blue Devils when they invaded Wildcat territory on Saturday. After this brief interview, Kenneth Scott of the Freshman class rendered a piano solo entitled “O Davidson,” which is the theme song of this program. The broadcast concluded with the song “Loreley,” played as the Davidson representatives signed off the air. On Wednesday night of this week between 8:35 and 8:50 o'clock the Davidson radio entertainment will again be on the air.came on the air with the concert orchestra under the direction of Professor James C. Pfohl. Mr. Martin says this should be one of the best broadcasts on the schedule, and he hopes many of the students will tune in at 8:35 Wednesday evening and hear the program. It is hoped by those in charge that the time of the broadcasts will remain permanently at the above hour.
