**The Richardson Fellows Program**
By JOHN MCLEAN
Managing Editor

The search for The Unusual Man. This is the avowed purpose of Davidson’s Richardson Fellows Program, which is now beginning to recruit freshmen under the direction of a new director, Dr. R. Bruce Jackson Jr. The Smith Richardson Foundation of Greensboro, N.C. grants to the Davidson program $20,000 each year. This money is used to seek out and develop those students who, in the words of past director Dr. W. G. McGavock, “have potential for leadership and who are anxious to develop that potential.”

The program is also an experiment in psychology for the top brass of the Richardson Foundation. Dr. James Farr and a staff of psychologists have fashioned the program as an experiment to perfect methods of recognizing leadership in men at an early age. But what, exactly, does the Foundation look for? There are certain built-in difficulties in answering this question because while the program looks for leaders it is at the same time searching for a meaning of leadership. But at any rate, the Davidson program, brought out of chaos in late 1967 by Dr. McGavock, spends its $20,000 in search of a promising group.

The selection is quite complicated and time-consuming. The steps are as follows: (1) hall discussions acquaint freshmen with the program, (2) freshmen submit applications to an advisory panel of faculty and Fellows, (3) applicants are interviewed by faculty advisors and Fellows, (4) finalists are selected on the basis of the interviews, and finally (5) Fellows are selected after a weekend retreat to Montreat, N.C.

Yet this selection process is itself under review. A recent outside study conducted by the Richardson Foundation revealed certain inadequacies in the acceptance, or rather rejection, procedure. Changes are planned whereby feelings of rejection in those who are passed over can be cushioned. There is no reason why an applicant who is not selected should have feelings of rejection, say both McGavock and Jackson. Both emphasized that everyone—and especially those who reach the stage of “finalists”—are just as well qualified to be Fellows. But the necessary limitations on the size of the group dictate that arbitrary selections sometimes be made.

Then too, the program seeks a diversity in those finally selected as Fellows. Certainly the most glamorous—and costly—of the program’s features is the summer internship system, highlighted in the other articles on this page. The trick in the internships is that it is easier for an employer to hire students who will be paid by the Richardson Foundation rather than himself, obviously. The usual stipend is $800 per summer, though the sum may be higher if extraordinary expenses are incurred by the Fellow, in living away from home, or the like. But there are indications that the supply is running lower than it has in past years and fewer internships may be subsidized in the future. Not all of them are backed by Richardson money at the present time. Most of the grant of $20,000 is spent.

**BURNEY TAKES PSYCHOLOGY OFF THE COUCH**

Sophomore Fellow Cecil Burney’s summer internship took him to clinical psychology wards and mental health centers in Corpus Christi, Texas. His work entailed intelligence testing, personal counseling, and observing sensitivity training groups.

**‘No, It’s Not $30 An Hour, But...’**

“You might say that I spent this summer learning how to become a good listener. Listening deeply and attentively to others is a difficult skill to learn. But I feel that the acquisition of this skill is vital to the future security of all of us, for listening is an important part of good communication, and good communication is essential if we are to survive,” were the words used by sophomore Cecil Burney to describe his work in clinical psychology, what was for him mainly a coming to terms with the problems of others and his own feelings toward other people.

Burney worked this summer under the supervision and with the guidance of mental health professionals in Corpus Christi, Texas. “My Richardson Fellows internship there provided an opportunity for me to gain some specific insight into the work of clinical psychology, a career which I have been considering for several years,” Burney said, “and general insight into other aspects of behavioral science.”

The bulk of his work was spent in administering psychological tests, learning how to evaluate testing results, writing reports, learning how to counsel patients by observation and some actual work with them on an individual basis and in groups.

On a different level, Burney also observed sensitivity training groups, assisted in psychological research, and surveyed community-wide efforts in mental health by visiting several agencies in the Corpus Christi area.

Burney was associated with Dr. Richard B. Austin Jr., a local clinical psychologist. “He spent much of his valuable time sharing his professional insights with me and listening to some of my newly-found insights,” Burney reported. “I spent most of my time in his office observing the practice of a clinical psychologist, and I especially learned much about dealing with children who have learning difficulties from him and from the other members of his staff.”

One of Burney’s most interesting experiences was being allowed to observe a six-week institute on Mexican-American children in the public school system, held on the campus of the University of Corpus Christi for about thirty elementary and junior high school principals and teachers and college professors. This institute is contributing to a psychological understanding of the cross-cultural differences and similarities between people in South Texas and, by extension, the world.

Burney also began research with Austin this summer which will be published fairly soon in professional psychological journals. “I feel that I gained valuable experience and insights which will help me to make a more rational career choice, and, more important, I feel strengthened as a person by the confidentiality, responsibility, and positive regard which my employers have showed me.”

“This work in psychology has made me feel that I am more aware of others around me, that I feel more sensitive to the needs of others, and am more cognizant of the effects which my actions can have on them.”

“I feel that I have become more accepting of others because of this summer.”on internships, and the Davidson program has complete discretion in the allotment of funds.

Such an experience was significant for me as a person, and I am sure that the effects of this summer will remain with me in a positive way for the rest of my life.”

THE MIDAS TOUCH

The Midas Touch of the Richardson Fellows Program works its wonders as the key to many various opportunities for the Fellows. Summer internships have given Davidson students an inside look at fields as diverse as business, government, social work, television production, banking, and clinical psychology.

Clodfelter Joins Study Of N.C. Slum Housing

Sophomore Richardson Fellow Danny Clodfelter spent this summer preparing a study for the Duke Power Company. Although most studies subsidized by Duke Power involve questions like “How many miles of cable to lay between Charlotte and Greensboro?”, this report was different.

Clodfelter’s job was to explore the feasibility of Duke Power's moving into the field of low-income housing. Most of his time was spent on field trips back and forth between larger cities in Piedmont North and South Carolina, the area which Duke Power serves. Contacts were made with city officials, federal agencies, and private citizens’ groups.

“The most interesting interview of all,” Clodfelter said, “was with an elderly colored lady who has organized the whole program of housing improvements in Durham. There is a white supervisor, but all the people who were working there were Negro, and so she was the real link.”

“This lady was herself in poverty. Her house had just two rooms: a bedroom and her ‘organization room.’”

The people Clodfelter worked with ranged from this ‘home-grown reformer’ variety all the way to the financial magnates who control North Carolina’s banking economy. Indeed, the whole purpose of his summer’s work was to help these businessmen decide whether to undertake the building of low-cost housing.

Clodfelter reports that the role of businessmen as businessmen is with respect to the way they view their changing responsibilities to the local community. “Businessmen must be seen in the context of something other than a profit-motivated system,” he says. “Most corporations are coming to recognize that their futures depend on the futures of the people in their communities. So they begin to feel some sense of abstract corporate responsibility to the community somewhat like the obligations a private citizen feels toward the whole community.”

The failure to provide decent housing, says Clodfelter, is the cause of what racial violence the state has seen. Then too, efforts to remedy the situation are being undercut by poor administration. Clodfelter criticized most governmental agencies and development commissions in the state for being “more interested in publishing flashy brochures than in helping solve the housing problem.” Some, not all, are guilty, however. Salisbury and Winston-Salem in particular have avoided this tendency. Clodfelter also feels that federal agents are more interested in their job security than their effectiveness. The result is that the most constructive efforts in housing have come from private groups and churches.

“In sum, the internship experience, at least in my case, provides exposure of the individual to highly motivated, generally successful (as defined by conventional society) persons. They in turn provide a reference point for the Fellow to evaluate himself, the society which produced those persons, and the direction in which he wishes to grow.”
