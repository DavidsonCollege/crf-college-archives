**Run for Peace**

By Rick Bob and Brandt Leibe

January 20 marked the end of the Clinton-Gore era when Governor George W. Bush was sworn in as the 43rd President of the United States. Though the event was not unusual for our country, no one should underestimate the significance of yet another peaceful transition of power, especially in light of the post-election turmoil and month-long process of recounting to determine a final winner. With many in the international community making light of America’s electoral blundering, no other country in the world can boast such a peaceful electoral history.

After the traditional prayer, delivered by Franklin Graham on behalf of his father Billy, and an inspiring American medley, Governor Bush stepped to the fore with Chief Justice William Rehnquist to take the oath of office with the same Bible that his father used. In his inaugural address, President Bush spoke of many broad themes and overarching American ideals. He began by thanking former President Clinton for his service to the nation and Vice President Gore for a “contest conducted with spirit and ended with grace.”

Acknowledging history throughout, President Bush repeatedly spoke of himself as just another part of a long story, “a story we continue but whose end we do not see.” Bush hit upon four main themes in his speech: civility, courage, compassion, and character. Recalling the bitter election battle, Bush spoke of the need for a new civility in the political dialogue to heal national wounds. Describing the atmosphere he would like to foster, Bush said civility “is the determined choice of trust over cynicism, of community over chaos. And this commitment, if we keep it, is a way to shared accomplishment.”

In discussing courage, President Bush listed some policy objectives that he hopes his Administration will fulfill, including education system improvements, Social Security and Medicare reform, and tax reform. Bush also hopes to reinvigorate a lackluster military “and build our defenses beyond challenge, lest weakness invite challenge.”

Emphasizing the importance of private compassion for solving social ills, Bush returned to the theme of compassionate conservatism that marked his campaign. “Church and charity, synagogue and mosque lend our communities their humanity, and they will have an honored place in our plans and in our laws,” said Bush. Finally, he discussed character by lauding the importance of personal responsibility and acts of decency. “Sometimes in life we are called to do great things. But as a saint of our times has said, every day we are called to do small things with great love. The most important tasks of a democracy are done by everyone.”

Having described his vision for America, President Bush highlighted the role of citizens ahead of the role of government, proclaiming, “When this spirit of citizenship is missing, no government program can replace it. When this spirit is present, no wrong can stand against it.”

After the speech,Many of the shivering onlookers made their way to the parade route to wait for President Bush and Vice President Cheney to drive past. At places, protestors had to be subdued by local authorities. However, the inaugural ceremony and the majority of the parade route were free from any sort of organized protesting.

Davidson alum Duncan offers commentary on Florida fiasco

Florida had a rough year in 2000. There was Elian Gonzalez. FSU lost to Oklahoma. The winter was freezing. And to top it all off, a mess larger than Disney World: the 2000 election. Hoping to untangle the veil of kudzu on this mysterious election, students gathered in the 900 room on January 23rd to hear Philip Duncan ’79 speak. Duncan is the director of the National Conference on Citizenship and former editor of The Congressional Quarterly. Fliers announcing his arrival read: “How the extraordinary events in Florida will influence governance in Washington and the public’s attitude toward participation in politics.”

In actuality, the answers provided to these two questions might be what George W. would call ‘fuzzy’ with not much to pin down. Duncan said that we the people will decide our own attitude toward participation, and that governance in Washington depends on the ability of lawmakers to compromise. Duncan did find a valuable lesson amidst all of the confusion that the election has left our nation with though. According to Duncan, “The Age of the Offered Hand,” a call by former President Bush to bipartisanship in his inaugural address, became instead “The Age of the Rolling Heads” in the nineties. The decade offered divisiveness and what many now call character assassination. The election in Florida was a crescendo of these times. It was a heavyweight title fight, divided sharply along party lines, with the fight promoters Warren Christopher and James Baker protecting their fighters. Democrats and Republicans pointed fingers and called names.

The lesson Duncan found within this mess was a need to revitalize citizen involvement in government and local communities. Duncan explained that polling shows Americans want to leave partisanship behind in politics. In order to do so, and to try and prevent events such as those in Florida, Americans “need more sophisticated national discourse.” The conversation must come from interested and informed citizens. He quoted Theodore Roosevelt as saying, “The first requisite of a good citizen of this Republic of course is that he shall be able and willing to pull his weight.” Dr. Susan Roberts, of the Political Science Department, explained that Duncan “wants us to take the lead” for improvement of our nation. The message was that through a more active citizenry, the public can affect the institutions of government in a way that creates more stable institutions.

The full effects of the election in Florida are still revealing themselves. Duncan pointed out that only personal action will improve the public’s dissatisfaction with federal and local government. The defining legacy of the Florida election may be the importance that it gave to individuals. It was just one citizen that designed the infamous butterfly ballot, and a difference of just a few hundred votes.
