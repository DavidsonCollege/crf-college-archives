### Football Team Favors Sypult As Next Coach
By STEVE MANK

Members of the football team recently expressed their concern over the selection of a new head coach. Since former head coach Ed Farrell’s departure last month, athletic director Kit Morris has been conducting a search for a replacement. Members of the team, however, are dissatisfied with the search’s progress. “Our training is suffering because we don’t have a coach,” junior Russ West said.

Many players said they would prefer to let assistant coach Jim Sypult move into Farrell’s position. Although Sypult is acting as head coach, he has no real authority over the players. “Since Sypult might not even be here next season, a lot of players aren’t even working out,” West said. Some team members feel that the training necessary for a new coach to work in the already small squad would diminish it even further. “If he [the new coach] wants to find out who the best hitters are, he’s going to make everyone hit; that’ll cause injuries,” West said. “Sypult already has a good knowledge of who can do what.”

Morris, however, believes the choosing of a new coach is too important a decision to make hastily. Although he feels that the team needs to have a coach soon, Morris said he should not let the urgency of the situation determine the outcome. “When there’s an absence at the helm, there’s likely to be a certain amount of suffering,” Morris stated. Morris said he may not name a new coach by March 1; he said he will choose Farrell’s successor as close to that date as possible. He outlined four guidelines that the new coach should embody: character and integrity, an imaginative approach to the football program, good leadership qualities, and a desire to work with the unusual program at Davidson.

Both Morris and players agreed that the head coach will have to make some major adjustments in order to fall into the Davidson routine and to make the team competitive—a team that has consistently had losing seasons. Although Morris mentioned no names, he did not rule out the possibility that Sypult might be head coach. Some players believe the decision has already been made. “Sypult is holding the team together. If they bring in a new coach everyone will leave,” junior Louis Krempel said.

Most feel that the ultimate goal of the decision is to improve the team; however, views differ on how this should be done. Morris thinks that the choice should be made cautiously without rushing. Some team members think that Sypult is a natural choice and that no further time should be wasted. Morris says he is listening to players’ opinions and is sympathetic. His long-term goals for the team are definite. “I want the [football] program to be a vital and vibrant part of student and community life,” he said.

### 252 Freshmen Self-Select
By TOM SCHILLING

The Patterson Court Council (PCC) determined the results of freshman self-selection Wednesday. Rusk House received the most interest, accepting 20 women and placing 31 on the waiting list. Ten people chose Emanon, and PAX took in 30 and placed four on its waiting list. The fraternity houses all picked up groups of 13 or more, and Kappa Alpha Order and Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity had waiting lists. Spencer House, the new all-women’s eating house on the Court, signed 47 freshman women.

PCC president Murray Simpson reported that “252 freshmen went through the self-selection system” this year while around 100 did not. He thought the process ran very smoothly and that the results looked “well-distributed throughout the court.” He was glad to see the relative success of PAX and Phi Delta Theta fraternity, which will take in 13 new members. He added that “PAX and Emanon may have to work together to promote co-ed eating on the court in the future.”

Associate Dean of Students Sue Ross agreed that the remaining co-ed houses will have to work harder. “Students seem to be leaning toward single-sex eating houses. I believe in offering a variety to freshmen, and this includes the option of co-ed dining.” When asked about justification for the new, third all-women’s eating house, Ross said...

### Communications Self-Study Committee Collects Student Surveys
By LISA THOMAS

The SGA Self-Study Committee has finished recording data from the surveys which were distributed to students in December. The student questionnaires are part of a broader, campus-wide self-study project which should be complete by November, according to psychology Professor John Kelton, chairman of the faculty self-study steering committee. Kelton is optimistic about the improvements that may result from the self-study project. “This study is especially important in that there is a new president—this is a particularly important time for reassessing.”

Three different surveys were used to gauge student opinion on government and academic concerns, student activities, and student services and physical resources. Two hundred of each survey were distributed to a random sample of students. Of these 600 questionnaires, only about 130 to 150 were returned, according to Elizabeth Brooks who co-chairs the SGA self-study committee with SGA president John Laughlin. According to Brooks, the percentage of the surveys that were returned does not constitute a representative sample of the student body. However, Brooks said the results do “point out problems and areas...Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

"that need to be revamped or questioned.” Brooks was “a little disappointed” at the number of surveys that were completed and returned. She attributed the low response to students who did not fill out the questionnaires and students who did fill them out but forgot to turn them in. She also felt that she was “naive in expecting a 20-member student committee to work so hard and to appreciate the seriousness of the committee’s work.”

According to Kelton, “The students handled the survey themselves. They did all the work.” The data gathered from the student surveys will be presented to the chairmen of 14 committees (including the student committee), who will use the data to compile reports later this spring to offer suggestions for College improvements. During the summer, a composite report will be composed for the whole campus, using information from the student questionnaire, a faculty questionnaire (which is already completed), and a third questionnaire which the Trustees will be asked to complete this weekend. “The committee chairmen are the people who asked the questions in the first place,” Kelton said, with some questions added by the SGA.

According to Kelton, the final self-study report will be presented to the Southern Association of Schools and Colleges as Davidson's request to renew its accreditation as an institution of higher learning. The Commission on College will send representatives to Davidson in November to make a decision regarding the request. Kelton said the accreditation “is not much of a question for us,” but “every major institution in the South is accredited or seeks accreditation and for some of them there is a question.”

The College undergoes a similar self-study project at 10-year intervals. The last of these was in the 1973-74 school year when such improvements as the renovation of the science buildings and the athletic facilities were suggested. Kelton added that the College's current curriculum is a result of the 1963-64 self-study project. “Before that, we had much more stringent requirements that required much more of the students’ time.”

Patterson Court Houses

Junior Gina Triplet, next year’s president at Emanon, was not worried about the house’s low draw in Self-selection. She said, “We picked up a few new members each term last year and hope to again this year.” She acknowledged the need to work harder to recruit members and remains optimistic for next year. Spencer house representative Connie Clark said she was happy with the outcome. “I was very pleased and I know that we have a great group of girls.” The house held a party in celebration Wednesday night and, Clark said, decided to go ahead with officer elections. Overall, Patterson Court houses received an even distribution of new members. Most of them got about what they expected. However, a significant number of freshmen avoided the Court, presumably to stay at the Commons.

Trustees Meet To Approve Budget For Coming Year

By ANDREA DIEDRICH

The Board of Trustees met Thursday and Friday morning with the intention of approving a new budget which would go into effect July 1. Rick Love, assistant to President Kuykendall, said “without a doubt, the Board will have a budget worked out by lunchtime Friday.” The Board also planned to review the report made by the Task Force on Racial and Ethnic Concerns.

According to Love, the first step in the budget-making process involves the President drafting a budget document. The Finance Committee of the Board of Trustees then reviews the President's proposal. The Finance Committee expected to review Kuykendall’s proposal Thursday and present their recommendations Friday morning. Love said the Finance Committee is “normally fairly supportive of the President’s proposed budget, yet they are by no means locked into it. Very often, the committee alters the proposal a little.” The Finance Committee expected to meet with the Personnel Committee Thursday to receive recommendations for the budget. Business Manager Bob Currie and Comptroller Bob Davidson are members of that Committee. The Faculty, Student, and Administrative Committee on Finance, chaired by philosophy Professor Lance Stell, also planned to meet with the Finance Committee Thursday to make suggestions.

According to Love, passage of a budget is not usually difficult. Some tension does arise between the Faculty, Administration, and the Trustees, he said, because “the Trustees have historically been committed to keeping the tuition low compared to other colleges of the same caliber [while] the faculty and staff press for programmatic improvement and increased compensation.” Love said either Kuykendall or Ben Craig, the Chairman of the Board, would probably present the policy statement on racial and ethnic concerns to the Board. He added that Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid John Griffith and mathematics Professor Bruce Jackson, co-chairmen of the Task Force, would likely attend the meeting at which the policy statement was presented.
