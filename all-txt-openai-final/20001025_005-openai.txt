### The Davnsonian - Social Security Modernization Will Empower Citizens

By BRANDT LEIBE

Social Security is one of the most successful programs in U.S. history, providing retirement security for Americans over the past
65 years. Social Security is facing new challenges, however; people are living longer, larger numbers of "Baby Boomers" will begin
to retire in 2008, and the number of workers for every retiree is declining. These demographic changes pose a problem
for Social Security because payroll taxes collected from current workers are used to pay benefits to retirees. By 2015, the
amount of Social Security benefits owed annually to retirees will exceed income into the system, and by 2037, Social Security
will be insolvent.

Despite the fact that the massive Baby Boom generation will begin drawing benefits eight years from now, the Clinton-Gore Administration
has done nothing to save Social Security. When Social Security first started, there were 42 workers to support each retiree;
in a few decades there will be only 2 workers per retiree. As a result, Social Security benefits will exceed
contributions beginning in 2015. Workers already pay 12.4% of their income into Social Security, but without reform, Social Security taxes
will have to be increased by 50% or benefits will have to be cut by 30%. The only alternative is
to increase the rate of return workers receive on their payroll taxes.

There are only a few ways to keep Social Security solvent and to protect the retirement income of all Americans.
Instead of dramatically raising taxes or cutting benefits, Social Security could be financed by permitting individuals to invest some of
their current income in personal retirement accounts. This innovative idea rests at the heart of Governor Bush’s Social Security proposal.

Governor Bush has outlined a list of principles that he will abide by in embarking on the push for reform
of the ailing Social Security system. Governor Bush believes that modernization must not alter existing benefits for retirees or near-retirees.
He also believes that Social Security surplus money should be used only for Social Security. He strongly believes that payroll
taxes must not be increased beyond their already exorbitant levels. Finally, Governor Bush believes that any modernization plan should include
provisions for individually controlled, voluntary personal retirement accounts, which will augment the Social Security safety net. These accounts will earn
higher rates of return, be screened for safety and soundness, and help workers build wealth that can be passed on
to their children.

Governor Bush is by no means the first person to propose personal retirement accounts, for virtually all bipartisan reform proposals
in Congress enable individuals to invest in personal accounts. These accounts would provide workers with higher rates of return on
their money. Social Security beneficiaries currently receive a paltry 1.9% rate of return on the total amount of money that
they paid into the system, and this already meager rate will diminish further as the Social Security system veers toward
insolvency in 2037. By contrast, inflation-adjusted average rates of return on equities and government inflation-indexed bonds are much higher, 7.2%
and 4%, respectively.

Personal retirement accounts will permit younger workers to accumulate wealth by saving and investing their own funds and enjoying the
benefits of compound interest. As an example, if a 22-year-old making $20,000 annually were permitted to invest 2 percentage points
of his or her payroll taxes in a personal account involving a mix of stocks and bonds, that account would
be worth over $100,000 at retirement. (Through all of this, parameters would be established to ensure the safety and soundness
of personal retirement account investments.) Additionally, unlike Social Security, individuals would own the assets in their personal retirement accounts and
could pass them on to their children or relatives.

Personal accounts would also create secure retirement income free from political risk. Under the current system, individuals do not have
any legal right to the money they contribute in payroll taxes. Congress can reduce Social Security benefits or increase taxes
on benefits at any time. Personal accounts would provide people with assets of their own that are not subject to
the whims of politicians.

Governor Bush believes Social Security is a defining American promise that must be kept. He will not change benefits in
any way.For current retirees or those near retirement. But to save Social Security for the next generation, he will lead
a bipartisan effort to reform it by giving individuals the option of voluntarily investing a portion of their Social Security
payroll taxes in personal retirement accounts. Governor Bush will honor and strengthen Social Security. He will protect all benefits for
today’s seniors and ensure that Social Security is available for their grandchildren. Adding the responsibility of personal retirement accounts into
an already shaky Social Security system will be a monumental effort that will require fundamental reform of the system. A
Gore administration would only throw more money at the problem, deferring it for later generations to deal with. Let’s be
absolutely clear: Al Gore has done nothing to fundamentally reform Social Security for the past seven and a half years,
and his current plans likewise offer no solutions for fundamental reform. Governor Bush will reform the system, protect benefits for
today’s seniors, and allow younger payroll taxpayers more control over the money taken from their paychecks.

Gore Social Security plan ensures solvency and offers new options

Social Security is currently collecting more money than it is paying off in benefits, but with the coming retirement of
the Baby Boom generation, the current system will begin to operate with a deficit in 2037. Therefore, Social Security faces
new challenges that threaten its long-term viability. Al Gore’s plan for Social Security includes keeping the system from bankruptcy, or
ensuring solvency, while strengthening the system simultaneously through personal retirement savings. However, these added measures will not siphon vital funds
from Social Security. Instead, Gore’s plan will use the Social Security surplus to save the system while also paying down
the national debt, saving additional money in interest payments which will also be given to Social Security.

Under Al Gore’s proposed balanced budget, the entire Social Security surplus—an estimated $2.3 trillion over ten years—would be transferred to
debt reduction and to the improvement of Social Security. Al Gore promises that he would not permit any other use
for the Social Security surplus other than for direct recirculation into the system. Gore’s plan to reduce the debt by
nearly $2.3 trillion over the next ten years will produce significant interest savings. These interest savings will be transferred to
extend the solvency of Social Security. Gore opposes any attempt to save Social Security through reduction in benefits or raising
the age of eligibility to receive benefits.

Gore proposes to expand the benefits offered under Social Security by eliminating the “Motherhood Penalty” by which current law inhibits
those raising children and out of the workforce to gain Social Security entitlements. Gore would give Social Security credit for
up to five years spent raising children. The increased benefits, while correcting unfair policies, would account for less than five
percent of the Social Security surplus. In addition to Social Security benefits, Gore proposes “Retirement Savings Plus,” which would not
divert funds from Social Security like privatization plans, but would build on the current IRAs and 401(k) plans. Retirement Savings
accounts, like IRAs and 401(k) plans, would be voluntary based in the private sector, not managed by the government; contributions
to these accounts would be tax-deductible and would grow tax-free. These accounts would offer an important new choice for millions
of families and leave them with a sizable nest egg at retirement in addition to their Social Security entitlement, all
without diverting the system’s funds.

Gore explains, “To me, Social Security is more than a government program. It is a solemn compact between the generations.”
Gore wants to ensure this “compact between the generations” indeed is a compact with stability. To account for the increasing
number of seniors in our population, Gore plans to ensure solvency by securing the Social Security surpluses only for the
system, and with the interest saved with the balanced budget. While providing for the continued viability of Social Security, Gore
plans also to add new options for additional retirement savings so that all generations will find their promised benefits at
retirement.
