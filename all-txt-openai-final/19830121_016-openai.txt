Saturday, 22 January

[The editors would like to apologize for the disappearance of Saturday, 15 January from last week’s Campus Calendar. Everyone has
their least favorite days of the week, the editors are no exception. It was just a poor choice to eliminate
an entire day of the week—one seventh of the calendar’s events—just because Saturdays are a drag. As it has turned
out, some people really like Saturday, so here it is in all its glory: Saturday, 22 January.]

MEN’S BASKETBALL: VMI. Johnston Gym. 7:30 p.m. As Steve Soud says, “The Keydets are liable to bear the brunt of
some pent-up Davidson frustrations.” Read the rest of the article too. Wow.

BLOW-OUT IN BELK QUAD: After the game. Come freeze with your friends while you try to drain six squat metal
containers, and several smaller plastic ones. But will there be popcorn?
