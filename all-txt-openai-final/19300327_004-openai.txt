THE DAVIDSONIAN, MARCH 27, 1930

Over Two Hundred Davidson Alumni Attend Enthusiastic Associations

Dr. Walter L. Lingle, President of Davidson, Addressed All Meetings and Received Cordial Response

RICHMOND LARGEST

Philadelphia Decides to Organize—Officers Are Selected at Other Points

Dr. Walter L. Lingle, president of Davidson, and Ernest Milton, alumni secretary, completed on Tuesday night, March 18, one of
the most comprehensive alumni itineraries ever planned and carried to completion by the alumni office. Starting close by, at Greensboro
on March 10, these two Davidson representatives went as far north as Boston, and attended several meetings in cities on
their return from the furthermost point. Slightly over 200 Davidson men attended the sessions.

Dinner-meetings were held at Greensboro, Richmond, Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston. Smaller groups of alumni are located at
Princeton and New Haven, and the schedule was so arranged that a stop could be made at these points for
luncheon engagements and an informal discussion of Davidson and her interests. At every city, Doctor Lingle spoke to an interested
group of men, and the reception accorded him and his remarks was most cordial. He outlined the physical life of
the campus, cited a number of changes which had been made in the curriculum, spoke of the needs of the
campus, and discussed some of the problems confronting the institution. In the open forums conducted after his address, many of
these items were elaborated upon, and at his urgent solicitation, the alumni offered suggestions for the betterment of the college.

The Richmond chapter had the largest representation of any group, the number approaching sixty men. Slightly over 50 alumni met
in New York. With the exception of New Haven and Princeton, the alumni ranged between twenty and twenty-five in attendance.
At New Haven, there were nine men, and at Princeton, five. Davidson alumni in Philadelphia, who have been having annual
meetings for the last three years, decided to perfect an organization, and accordingly, they elected officers. Boston, New Haven, and
Princeton did not organize because of the transiency of the alumni, but all other associations elected officers. Elsewhere on this
page is a list of the new leaders. Other information regarding this extensive trip can also be obtained from several
columns on this page.

Davidson has five alumni studying at Princeton in the graduate school and theological seminary, and every one of them attended
the luncheon there on Thursday, March 13, to have a 100 percent attendance. Ten Davidson men are located at New
Haven, Conn., and nine of these were at the luncheon, giving them a percentage of 90. It is believed that
the Princeton group has made a record.

The class of 1928 had the largest number of representatives at the nine alumni meetings. Thirty-two '28ers attended. The class
of 1929 was second with 22 men, followed by the class of 1927 with 17, and the class of 1926
with 15. In other words, 86 of the total of over two hundred were from the last four classes which
graduated at Davidson. This is indicative of two things: First, that recent graduates have gone north in large numbers, and
second, that the interest of our younger alumni is very keen.

A guest at the New York alumni meeting was S. D. Pelham, of New York, who said that he had
in his possession an adze which was used in the construction of the first Chambers building back in the '60s.
He said that it had been handed down in his family, and that if Davidson had a museum, he would
give it to the college. Doctor Lingle graciously accepted it. Mr. Pelham is going to send it to Doctor Lingle,
and will give data regarding its history.

Bob Kirkpatrick assumed the role of cheerleader at the Richmond meeting, and did a great job of it. Another feature
of that dinner was a quartet composed of Jim Calizan, Stud Cray, Tom Hamilton, and John Cunningham, the latter a
graduate of Hampden-Sydney.

Exactly 41 changes of address have been made on the alumni records as a result of the recent trip. This
is not anything out of the ordinary, for each year this has been done. Alumni have not been educated to
the idea of sending in to the alumni office a notice of their change of address. Alumni meetings always are
a source of information. The approaching engagements of several of the alumni came to light in conversations with individuals, but
no definite announcement has been made, and the names of the men are being withheld until a “release date” is
obtained.

Alumni in Washington and Philadelphia discussed the feasibility of meeting together oftener, and took definite action regarding this. They wanted
a dinner or luncheon at which Davidson would be the principal discussion. Executive committees at both places were empowered to
act.

Such a trip as was recently made always gives the alumni secretary an opportunity to be of service to individual
alumni. Several requests were made of him during the tour, and he has been busy fulfilling them since his return.

What We Told The Alumni
By Dr. Walter L. Lingle

When we visited the nine Alumni Associations, extending from Greensboro, N. C., to Boston, Mass., and they asked us to
talk, we generally gave them a broadside about Davidson. Perhaps, a summary of what we said may be interesting to
our students and to other alumni.

1. Faculty—Davidson now has 45 men in her faculty. They have all done graduate work at great universities, and the
large majority of them hold high degrees from the best universities of America and Europe.

2. Students—During this session, 617 students have registered at Davidson. The registration last year was 611. Of the 617 students
with us this year, 347 are from North Carolina, and the other 270 are from other states and countries.

Impressions
By Dr. Walter L. Lingle

Our journey took us to the annual meetings of nine different Davidson College Alumni Associations, ranging all the way from
Greensboro, North Carolina, to Boston, Mass. Mr. Ernest Milton, our efficient Alumni Secretary, has written concerning the details of these
meetings. I have been requested to give my impressions.

First of all, let me say, that it is a great inspiration to the President of an institution to know
that there are live groups of Alumni in so many important cities and centers, who have an ever-increasing love and
loyalty for the old College. At each place, I felt that the group at the next could not possibly be
so fine or so enthusiastic. But they were. I appreciate with all my heart the cordial and courteous way in
which we were received at every place. The Alumni groups in the different places seem to vie with each other
in their cordiality and hospitality. They warmed our hearts.

It was worth a great deal to us to visit institutions like Johns Hopkins, Princeton, Yale, and Harvard. While those
are great universities, one can gather from them a great many suggestions for the smaller college. In all of those
university centers, we found Davidson graduate students taking high stands. Sometimes people have intimated that Davidson is not sending a
sufficient number of her graduates to the great universities to do graduate work. Maybe so, but I wonder if they
realize how many we are sending. I am sure that I never realized before how many former students we have
in universities doing graduate work.

In every place, our Alumni showed the keenest interest in everything that is going on at Davidson. They asked about
the various members of the faculty, staff workers, students, and janitors. They also asked about new buildings, new courses of
study, and so forth. Our Alumni at the university centers also had many suggestions to make when the meetings were
thrown open for suggestions. No time was spent in reminiscing and rehearsing college boy pranks and faculty foibles.from 25 other
states and countries. Our students are preparing for the following professions: Business, 96; Medicine, 93; Ministry, 79; Law, 63; Teaching,
35; Engineering, 29; eighteen other professions, 53; and 157 are undecided.

3. Finances
The endowment of Davidson in round numbers is $900,000. The buildings and grounds are worth more than $1,500,000. Thus, the
total assets of the College amount to about $2,500,000. Our annual budget of expenditures is about $300,000. Of this amount,
we receive about $53,000 as income from endowment, and about $70,000 from the Duke Foundation. Practically all the remainder of
the budget has to come from student fees. The income of the Duke Endowment is largely dependent upon the success
of the industrial incorporations in which the endowment is invested. It is, therefore, impossible for the endowment to guarantee any
fixed annual amount. It can only pay what it makes. Davidson College, along with other institutions, is deeply indebted to
Mr. Duke. It is sometimes supposed that Davidson is rich and lacks nothing. The expansion of the college has been
so great in recent years that the annual budget of expenses is already equal to the income and sometimes greater.
Before there can be any further expansion, there will have to be a larger income.

4. New Chambers has been completed and will be dedicated at the next Commencement. The total cost was approximately $625,000.
It is almost perfect in every way. There is only one serious defect. The acoustics of the banquet hall are
very bad. Experts have estimated that it can be cured for $3,150.00. We wish that we had that amount. There
is still a debt on the New Chambers Building of about $70,000. There are about $70,000 (Continued on Page 5)

but from our point of view, I feel that this itinerary among our Alumni was well worth all the time
and labor that we put into it. We can visualize the Davidson Alumni out in the world at their life
work as we could not do before. Not only so, but we brought back many valuable suggestions which will be
helpful for years to come.

After we had made short talks, the remainder of the time at each place was spent in asking and answering
questions and in making suggestions which might be helpful to the faculty. We all felt that these meetings should be
used for inspirational and constructive purposes. There was something distinctive about each Alumni group. At Johns Hopkins, one instinctively felt
that he was in an academic atmosphere. In New York, we felt that we were in a business atmosphere. By
the way, a business man who has been in New York for many years and has many business contacts and
attends many business meetings said that the meeting of the Davidson Alumni in New York is composed of the finest
group of men that he ever meets in that great city. I greatly enjoyed the close fellowship with Ernest Milton,
our Alumni Secretary. For those ten days, we traveled together, roomed together, ate together, talked together, and had all things
in common. As a result, I know him better and like him even better than ever. He knows the Alumni.
At Greensboro, each alumnus introduced the man on his right. At the close of the introductions, a trustee laid a
half dollar on the table and said that he had put it there for the man who would arise and
call every man present by his name. At my request, Ernest Milton arose and named every man. He could have
done the same thing at all nine of our meetings. I do not know how Alumni feel about it, but
from our point of view, I feel that this itinerary among our Alumni was well worth all the time and
labor that we put into it. We can visualize the Davidson Alumni out in the world at their life work
as we could not do before. Not only so, but we brought back many valuable suggestions which will be helpful
for years to come.
