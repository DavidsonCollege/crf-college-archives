Charleston, South Carolina, the first week in December, and it is expected that a good number of local members will attend. Officers for the year are: Dick, president; John Mawhinney, vice-president; Dave, secretary; and Gilliam, treasurer. Sophomores at Purdue rode down the Union dumbwaiter in order to gain admittance to the freshman mixer in the Union ballroom. And then were ejected.

Mrs. Louise Nelson Pfohl performed a recital before the Music Club Monday evening, October 11. Mrs. Pfohl and Dr. J.W. McHugh, director of the Glee Club, were the main attractions. Students dancing to swing music generated enough heat to warm a two-story house. Parcell has been running in beautiful form during the last week, and Joe Gammon and Kellog have shown reserve strength.

Three hundred blurry-eyed, unslept Ohio State freshmen congregated on Wednesday morning and waited. They waited half an hour for the rest of their class to arrive for freshman convocation. Then one of them looked at his program card to find the meeting scheduled for the next day.

Student organizations at the University of North Carolina have banned the hectic “big apple.” Some said the floor on which most student dances are held was too frail to withstand the stomping. But the chief reason seemed to be, as one boy expressed it: “The students are just getting fed up on the big apple.”

Professor Scott at the University of Minnesota requested his students to move forward and use up the front seats. All came forward except one lad who kept his remote seat. “Move down to the front,” prompted Professor Scott. The lad replied, “Say, lieutenant, I'm so plum tuckered out I can’t take another step forward.”

Davidson College enrollment has seen a gain of just two students over last year. The college hopes through this plan to render a more complete service to the students and recent graduates than heretofore with respect to helping them with smokers... giving them the kind of a smoke they want... in the way they like it best. Chesterfields are refreshingly milder—they’ve got a taste that smokers like. Chesterfields are different from all the rest... THEY SATISFY.
