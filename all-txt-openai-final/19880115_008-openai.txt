**How Mr. Schultze Entertained Us**

I still forget to thank Mr. Schultze
For showing me reality
When my eyes weren’t ready
For the mess, just yet.

His imagination startled like the color of his hair
A dirty leprechaun auburn
And danced like the flames on his calluses
Which he set on fire after dinner
For the entertainment of me and his daughter,
My bucktoothed best friend.

On Halloween he wore devil’s horns
Sat on top of his roof
Hurling fistfuls of wrapped candy
That mimicked our theatrical mouths.

On random summer nights our bottoms sticking
To the station wagon vinyl
He drove a group of us, giggling
Downtown, and parked outside
Of the city jail.

We listened to the inmates rage
Puzzled at their language.
And I know he couldn’t have planned it, but as he drove towards home
He hesitated and turned around
So we could watch the wet sheet
Being pulled, just up to the neck
Of a chalky, loose-lipped man,
His afro surrounded by a nimbus of blood.

Our brains spun and twirled,
Our heads glowed red, until
We too, were lights on the police car.

“How the cars supposed to know that? Not a one of them stops by our house to say so much
as a Howdy do, Miss Ann, Mr. Charles, Little Mr. Bobby. You can believe me they won’t stop for you
either, Little Miss.”

“Even though you’re a pretty thing,” Charles adds as Betty walks up to the house, much slower than she ran
out to the road.

“Get any mail, honey?” I ask.

“No, Momma.” She waves her empty hands at me like I should've noticed, shouldn’t have asked.

“You hear the way she talks to me,” I mutter to Charles, but he’s walked off from me and moved
up near, looking down at her, “You expecting a letter from Fred?”

“No. Yeah. Well, I don’t know.” She laughs. “No. Yeah.”

Dad smiles, turns to me and says, “Mom, I’m going out to the store. You want anything?”

“I do, honey. Would you get some wire for the chickens? They keep getting out of the little fence we’ve
got for them now, and they’ve got no more sense than Betty here, running out into the road.”

He’s walking out to the car fast now before I have time to think of anything else. “Oh, and would
you go down to the Sew and So and pick me up some thread and milk. Some ham, no not
ham, some beans over at Grier’s.”

“I ain’t going grocery shopping today. Thank you very much Mrs. Landis, but I tell you what I will do.
I'll get that thread so you can do something about this shirt of mine.” He’s already backing out the drive.
I wish he wouldn't go away so fast. I know he can hear me with his window rolled down.

“And some milk, Charles.”

“And some milk.” He’s backed into the highway, and is shifting gears.

“And some wire.” I’m yelling through the passenger side, but the glass window is rolled up on this side. I
smile so the neighbors don’t think I’m a nag or crazy woman, let my arms fall to my side. He
waves at me and drives away. I wonder why he had to leave so fast. I wonder why he isn’t
even driving towards the drug store.

I turn around, walk back towards the house. Betty’s sitting out on a chair. I sit down beside her. “What
you sitting out here for? I didn’t mean no harm what I said to you. I just don’t want you
getting hurt. That’s all, Betty.”

Bob is crying like the end of all creation inside. “You might want to see what’s bothering him so I
can sleep in some quiet tonight.” She’s always rude to me when Charles isn’t there.

“Do you like talking to your mother like that?” I ask her.

“Like what, Momma.” Now she smiles like she doesn’t know what I’m talking about.

“You know exactly what I’m talking about, Betty.” I’m smiling too since the neighbors might start getting...wrong ideas if they
think I’m fighting all the time with my daughter. I’m a peace-loving woman at heart, sing in the choir over
at Oak Grove Methodist, and have ever since I was a child of eight. I had a beautiful voice as
a child, sang solos and all. Sometimes, Charles and I have even sung a duet or two in front of
everybody. I think he’s got the better voice, but he’s never joined the choir, says he likes listening to me
sing too much to get up there and start singing over me. Betty laughed in my face when I suggested
she join the choir when she had reached a suitable age, two or three years ago.

Along the streets of downtown Oak Grove, there’s still a drug store, a department store for the ladies, and the
Town Hotel sign. There’s the Oak Grove Methodist Church just one block off the downtown strip. Oak Grove Baptist is
out on the highway, which isn’t four, six, or eight lanes, but two. The interstate runs through the other side
of Sweet Gum, goes all the way down to Charlotte, but I don’t go that way much. Car barely holds
up as it is. Betty scares me the way she slams the car door and runs towards the road. I’m
afraid she'll get hit one day, the way she dances into its edge sometimes. “Betty, get away from there. You’re
liable to get hit.” “Don’t hurt the cars,” Charles is coming out to hold the car door open, holding me
instead. “Charles, I’m being serious.”

“Isn't it a pretty day?” She looks up at the sky like God might find her here, after she’s skipped
church two Sundays in a row. I want to save my daughter from being hurt, but she doesn’t ever listen
to me. “Bob in his bed?” “He was up crawling around, watching TV when I last saw him.” He knows
he should be sleeping. I go inside and find him crying in front of the TV set. I pick him
up with a firmness that suggests both the spanking he deserves for being out of bed, and the holding that
will make him stop crying. “What’s the matter, Bobby? Why you get out of bed so early? It ain’t five.”
Bobby is crying loud, because he thinks he can’t be heard over the television noise. “I was just saying goodbye
to Daddy. I was just in the front yard. I thought you were in bed, Bobby.” I walk back over
to his bedroom, and set him in his crib. “How'd you get out of bed, Bobby?” Bobby keeps crying. He
can’t talk to point any accusations at anyone, but I have my suspicions. I go back outside, planning to sit
with Betty, and ask her why she'd gotten Bobby out of the crib like I know she’s done, but Bobby
starts crying again, so I have to stay by his crib for an hour or two until it’s dark. Then
I have to start cooking supper as best I can without the beans since Charles hasn’t brought them home yet.

The store isn’t doing so well as it used to. People move away from this town as fast as they
can. It isn’t the kind of town you move to. I don’t like going down to the store with him
much. It makes me sad to see how run down the Sew and So looks, and how the Town Hotel
has closed, but we have to drive by them both every Sunday morning. As if I don’t have sins enough
of my own to pray for, I have to worry how Betty’s going to survive in this town if it
keeps falling apart all around her, and worrying when she might decide it’s time for her to do like the
other young people do, and move away. “Betty, you want to come in here and see that Bobby keeps quiet?
I’m starting supper.” She’s out in the front yard watching the cars go by, most of them aren’t even from
around here, just driving between Sweet Gum and Mockerville. The nuclear power plant’s in Sweet Gum and the mills are
over by Mockerville. Still, Betty seems
