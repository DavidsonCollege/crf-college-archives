Fairies Name All-American Weinies
By THE THREE FAIRIES

College basketball has now struggled through another year and, deferring to tradition, we have selected our All-American All-Weinie team. Head Schnitzel for this year is a unanimous choice, Rutgers' pseudo All-American Phil Sellers, who could be caught in bed with a 15-year-old girl and vehemently deny statutory rape.

Runner-up for Most Valuable Weinie is Jackie Gilloon, another link in a long line of South Carolina sausages, by virtue of his self-effacing modesty. Several special awards have been designated for other members of this year’s farters.

The Harry Krohn Memorial Nerd Award goes to VMI’s Kelly Lombard, a Krohn look-alike. The Memorial Rag Award goes to Notre Dame’s Adrian Dantley for his remarkable ability to stay on the rag for a record three-year period. The Dave Meyers Memorial Ugly Award and an autographed tube of Clearasil from Wolfman Jack go to Stan “Who?” Boskovich, who barely edged out the entire Furman team.

The coveted Sports Illustrated Cover Curse Award goes to Tennessee’s footlongs, “The Bernie and Ernie Show,” who made the cover in order to lose to VMI. Finally, this year’s Corndog Award Committee had to travel to New York to find Cornbread Maxwell and his ostentatious foul shooting style.

Coach of this year’s squad is Dean Smith, who secured his selection by complaining about TV timeouts. Honorary Weinie Sports Information Director is once again Emil Parker. We must not neglect to mention the second team Hot Dogs, the five Davidson freshmen, for their post-season antics.

We now indict eight players, who in our four years of direct contact with college basketball have distinguished themselves with their involvement in the total college experience and the world of crime. Of particular note is Jackie Gilloon, who continued his hot dog antics off the court, off the road, through two cars, through a hedge, and into a tree. Drunk and disorderly, but at least Jackie laid off the dope that night, as others cared to indulge.

Among the most illustrious who have been nailed are Bo Ellis, and our own horticultural buffs Jay Powell and Sheldon Parker. Into less grass, but more of a dope, was Mo Rivers with his brilliantly planned theft of a bottle of Excedrin. The most spectacular effort provided this winter was the virtuoso performance of Richmond’s Tony Marshall, who in one night managed to get nabbed with credit cards stolen from teammates, his own dope, and several other people’s stereos.

Of those who have moved on to the pro ranks, our two big men are Tom “Pinball Wizard” Burleson and Marvin “Tireiron” Barnes. Barnes only moved to the college all-criminal team after a spectacular high school felony. Standing 6’9”, with a mask, wearing his letter jacket, and size 16½ sneakers, Marvin proceeded to hold up a bus for $4.42 before walking directly home in fresh snow.

Coach of this fast-fingered squad is Tates Locke, who committed 9,863 recruiting violations, grabbed a cheerleader, and...Got Clemson three years probation, before seeking asylum as an assistant coach in the NBA. In over four years, it is apparent that no one in college basketball was either horny or capable enough to commit a sex crime, though Tom Verlin will argue the point.

Now moving to less important matters, IMAC softball and volleyball play continued. We were up on Field #3 yesterday and caught the I Felta Thi’s beating Off Again 4-3. With the best wrists in the school, Bob Canning was a natural selection for pivot man. Mark Firth’s football injury did not prevent him from participating in the festivities. The Castrati trounced Etc., 14-4. Elsewhere, give ATO credit for being smart enough not to show up to catch the Clap. In the girls’ action, the Pickles rallied to beat awesome IKL 14-11. Both teams improved on their previous performances, no doubt due to the suggestive comments of the numerous coaches, spectators, and voyeurs on the sidelines. Despite defeat, blond bombshell Shelly Harvey repeatedly yelled, “What a team!”

Recalling last week’s letter to the editor, we have suddenly become weary of their taking crap for writing this column. In the future, we shall adhere to the principle of economy and totally ignore Ockham’s Razor. In their final week of newsprint, we must note that the haughty Razor’s were nicked by Baby Rick 15-10 in softball, and acted like hammers by unmercifully pounding hapless ATO #1 in volleyball 15-0, 16-2. Despite Monday’s Supreme Court ruling, the Three Fairies should return next week to report on more unnatural acts between consenting adults.
