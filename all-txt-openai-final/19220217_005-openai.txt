THE DAVIDSONIAN, FEBRUARY 17, 1922.

INDOOR RIFLE RANGE IS BEING PREPARED AT GYM

THE PEANUT PARCHER

R. O. T. C. ISSUE.

The indoor rifle range in the basement of the gymnasium is now in use every day, and preparation is being made for inter-company and inter-collegiate matches. The remainder of this month will be spent in the development of company teams.

The inter-company matches will be held during the month of March, according to the following schedule:
- Freshmen, A vs. B and C vs. D, March 2, at 4:30 p.m.
- Winners, March 3, at 4:30 p.m.
- Sophomores, A vs. B and C vs. D, on March 4, at 4:30 p.m.
- Any men in Co. A vs. B and C vs. D, on March 9, at 4:30 p.m.

The schedule for the use of the range is posted on the R. O. T. C. bulletin board.

Now that winter’s nearly over, mittens, wool sweaters and socks, helmets, and overcoats will be issued next week. Shoot him in the pants, man, for the coat’s mine.

On the farm: More rain, more rest.
At Davidson: More rain, more mess.

Some Happenings on the Deputation Trip to Concord.
Small Boy (after quartette sang “My Son”)—“Gee, but that fellow sings a wicked sasparilla!”

The members of the R. O. T. C. corps ought to petition the faculty for a correspondence course in Military Science and Tactics.

Seeing a Grand piano for the first time—“Say, Purdy, how do you work this thing?”

The “Run On Tell Colonel” Corps gives a commission as lieutenant in the Reserve Corps but what we want is a clear discharge.

The inter-collegiate matches will be held during the month of April. Davidson will shoot against Ga. Tech, Miss. A. & M., Northwestern Univ. (Freshmen only), Univ. of Fla., and probably other schools. A medal will be awarded to the student earning the highest average score in the inter-collegiate matches.

If Abe Lincoln walked 8 hours to borrow a book, what will Watt McCain get after walking forty-one hours?

Company A Sponsor, to Bitzer—“Rolston, do you receive any pay for your gallant service in the R. O. T. C.?”
Bitzer—“Yes, $12.00 a day once a month.”

Little drops of water,
Little grains of sand.
My! but the R. O. T. C.
Will make you a strong man.

“Not Original.”

One advantage a peg leg man in the R. O. T. C. Corps would have, he could hold up his army socks with thumb tacks.

Ashes to ashes and dust to dust,
If the executive committee don't get you
The R. O. T. C. must.

’Tis rumored that the roof garden of our new dormitory will be used as a drill hall.

“One down seven to go,” said Corp. Abernathy as number four in the rear rank fell out.

—Next we parch the new building—

Balaam Gamble, while making his return to Davidson a few nights ago on aborrowed horse, was found by some of his friends having trouble with said horses. The difficulty was Gamble wanted to go one way and the horse the other, and neither one would give in. The matter was settled by the horse being led in and Gamble sat like Marshal Ney, of old, upon his fiery steed.

Quartette sleeps through nine o’clock engagement, and arrives at school an hour late. Then as an opening number they sang, “Tuck Me To Sleep.”

It took YEARS to develop CAMEL QUALITY. We worked on Camels for years before we put them on the market. Years of testing, blending, experimenting with the world’s choicest tobaccos. And now, EVERY DAY, all our skill, manufacturing experience, and lifelong knowledge of fine tobaccos are concentrated on making Camel the best cigarette that can be produced. There’s nothing else like Camel QUALITY. And there’s nothing else like Camel's wonderful smoothness, fine tobacco flavor, and FREEDOM FROM CIGARETTY AFTERTASTE. That’s why Camel popularity is growing faster than ever. A better cigarette cannot be made. We put the utmost quality into THIS ONE BRAND.
