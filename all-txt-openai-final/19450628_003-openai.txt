Sit back and take one more puff on the dying pipe. Breathe deeply of the satisfaction you have received from reading the first parts of this Davidsonian, for I warn you, you'll disgustedly light that pipe again, put on your slippers, get out of that easy chair, and just, in general, quit after reaching the “three-oh” mark at the end of this column, if you get that far.

This is the time of year most sports writers dream about. Sports haven't really gotten into full swing, and so each writer can beat the bridge about what his team’ll do to the opposition. That just about leaves me out. In the first place, I’m no sports writer. Then, too, I don’t dream about any time of the year except Christmas and September when I'll be eighteen. But Mel insisted that I write and fill up this side of the page until one of you got so sick of it you’d get out of those slippers and that easy chair, crush that pipe, and volunteer for the vacancy I'll leave just as soon as you do volunteer.

One break for sports fans didn’t break last week when Lin O’Briant, of Durham, who played a good bit of basketball for the Wildcats last winter, had a little run-in with the draft board in Durham. It seems that his uncle has been kicked off of it and Lyn is 1-A. He was a fine boy and a good ball player and one who really knows his sports. One might “bull” with him all night and Lyn would never repeat himself. Personally, I had looked forward to a long sports bull session and was genuinely disappointed when he could not make it. I’m sure I wasn’t the only one. Charlie Blackburn, who was also a fine player for us, is army-bound and expects a call anytime. Jack Etheridge is in Midshipman school at Pass Christian, Miss. Jim Lowry spent last semester at Union Seminary and has a church in Rocky Mount for the summer, I understand. Gabby Bryant is at Great Lakes, so they tell me. Thus is the tale of our basketball team. Al Scarborough, Bill Simpson, and John Wall are the only ones still around.

Intramural softball begins this week. It should have hit full stride by the time the paper is out. There are six active teams: the Independents and Betas fielding two each; the Pi Kapps and Pikas fielding one together; and the Sigma, KAs, SAEs, and SPEs fielding one. I'll not make a prediction this week, because all of you know who I would pick and I’d probably be wrong, and everyone would be on my neck and I’d have to be thinking up excuses and so would the team I picked. So-o-o-o, I'll leave it up to you all because one of you is going to get so sick of me that you'll get out of those slippers and that easy chair, crush that pipe, and volunteer for the vacancy I'll leave just as soon as you do volunteer.

P.T. must also get its due recognition. Three days a week we have it, and if everyone really puts out like some choice few have been doing, we'll really have a football team next fall. In case someone is interested or does not know, P.T. is held every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday behind the eastern stands of Richardson Field. The student body is turning out practically 100 percent to reap the benefits of such a chance. And it really seems to be doing some men good, such as Nisbet and Stukes to mention two.

The Davidson Legion team does not seem to be faring so well against its opposition to date. But good ball is being played and it is a spectacle none of us should miss, for we see so little of it on the Hill. There is a good bit of talent on the team and we, the student body of Davidson, should do our part to turn it into a winning outfit. Let’s turn out as one to these games and give them some real Davidson backing.

Intra-Murals Award Made
Independents Win Loving Cup For One Year

W. Heath Whittle, assistant Director of Physical Education, reported a successful season in intramural sports with 86 per cent of total student participation in an aggregate of 113 contests. He awarded first place to the “Independents” who earned a season's total of 762 points. With this honor went the “Davidson Inter-Fraternity Trophy” — a large loving cup on a suitably inscribed base. The cup is kept for the following year by the winning group. It has been previously awarded to the Kappa Alpha fraternity (1941-42), the Phi Delta Theta (1939-40 and 1940-41), and the Kappa Sigmas (1942-43).

Second place was won by the Sigma Phi Epsilons with 736 points. Others in the running were: third place, Beta Theta Pi’s; fourth place, Kappa Sigma’s; fifth place, Pi Kappa Phis; and sixth place, Pi Kappa Alpha’s.
