**Revamped Cat Pack ready to get rowdy**

Men’s basketball opens exhibition play tonight, marking the beginning of what is undoubtedly the most exciting sports season at Davidson.

The school’s most visible team plays on ESPN twice this year (a Preseason NIT game against Texas Tech on Tuesday
and a Dec. 29 match-up at Duke) and on ESPN2 in the regular season opener vs. North Carolina. The team
is two years removed from a near upset of Ohio State in the first round of the 2002 NCAA tourney,
to which it has a legitimate chance to return this spring. With our football team stuck in non-scholarship status, no
other team around here can match this type of hype. All the excitement surrounding the team, coupled with the fact
that basketball is by far the most popular sport at Davidson, should provide for an electric atmosphere at games in
Belk Arena. Fans don’t need to go Cameron Crazy, but this kind of team at this kind of school should
create a huge buzz. Wildcat fans should get a little wild.

Sadly, this was far from the case last year. Aside from the home opener against Charlotte, the only buzz at
home games came from the scoring table. The gym was rarely full, and fans ranged from shy and timid to
apathetic. Those who did make an effort to act like a college crowd stood out (for various reasons). In one
instance, a group of fans who were breaking the mold of mild manners and letting the other team know whose
house they were in were actually lectured by a professor at halftime on the value of positive reinforcement. When the
students protested that they were saying nothing overly inappropriate, the professor threatened to report them to the Dean of Students.
These fans were in the student section behind the opposing team’s bench.

Problems with pompous professors could be avoided altogether by sitting behind the front basket in the seats beside the band.
This section was blocked off last year and reserved for members of the newly formed “Cat Pack,” with the hopes
of providing a haven for students with the desire to stand up and scream during games. Students could join the
Pack by simply paying $5, and they could sit in the section by wearing the red shirt provided as part
of the registration package. The attempt was unsuccessful. Despite high enrollment, the number of people who actually took part in
the Cat Pack waned as the season wore on. Those who did stay confused and frustrated many of their fellow
fans with odd cheers and odder tendencies, such as distracting Davidson players during free throw attempts.

Instead of helping to improve the things they complained about, many students just sat back unhappily in their seats and
did just that: complain.

Things will be different this year. A Cat Pack Committee has been organized, and attempts to acquire a larger and
wider base of people have so far been successful. One member of the committee has promised that the Pack “will
be so rowdy this year that people will be dying to sit behind the goal.” The Pack will sponsor free
pizza and quesadilla dinners before home games to get its members there early, ready to rage on the opposing teams
the minute they step onto the floor in Belk Arena. Members of the committee have already begun working to get
people wearing red on “Red Day” (Tuesday), which will culminate in the broadcast.

**Tradition vs. hazing:**

Some people would say that hazing is a great tradition. Authorities would say that all hazing must be eliminated. The
debate continues in youth and amateur sports and will continue until parents and outsiders gain complete control over all sports.
In a hazing incident practiced by a middle school football team, a 12-year-old had his leg broken in two places
and suffered severe blood loss. Garrett Drogosch was hospitalized for four days after festivities in the team’s annual “Eighth Grade
Hit Day.” Investigations are still being held at Mill Middle School, outside of Detroit, but the three coaches of the
team have been fired from their coaching positions. Apparently, the tradition involved the freedom for eighth graders on the team
to do anything they pleased to the younger players. There will no longer be “Eighth Grade Hit Day.”

**A quarterback’s worst nightmare:**

Being sacked by the opposing team’s mascot, then not being able to catch him. University of North Alabama quarterback Nick
Hall had that nightmare come true, sort of. Although he was tackled as his team ran out the clock in
their 17-10 victory over top-ranked Valdosta St, the tackler was not the opposing team’s mascot. He was a fan dressed
up as a monkey who, upon making the tackle,Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

of the Texas Tech game at 9 p.m. in the 900 Room. They envision a “sea of red” at games
this year, drawing on the energy of a rambunctious Cat Pack. This is a call to every person (myself included)
who complained about the games last year and did nothing about it, as well as every freshman who wants the
level of intensity in the stands to match the level of play on the floor. Swipe $5 on your CatCard
and get your shirt, and stand in the Pack. Get there early, leave late, and go crazy. Do your part
to make going to the games as fun as it can and should be. Do this, and students won’t be
the ones complaining at games.

‘mascots and plenty more outran the QB and was later tracked down by police. Monkey lay, monkey flew... A former
Valparaiso football player, who most likely caught passes at our own Richardson Stadium a few years back, has pleaded guilty
to charges of voyeurism. Christopher Hayen, who removed himself from the football team after facing charges of child pornography, was
caught putting a wireless camera in the women’s volleyball team’s locker room. Enough said...

Any Andy Roddick fans out there? He’s having his own reality show next spring, titled “The Tour.” Cameras will follow
him around as he competes in the ATP tour from May to September. Unfortunately for Mandy Moore fans, she has
said that her personal life will be kept behind closed doors. Bumblebee tuna.

Why is it that men get to ogle what appear to be swimsuit models reporting from the sideline while women
are stuck with John Madden? It’s unfair and annoying. Do you remember the last time you actually listened to what
Lisa Guerrero was saying? It’s usually something along the lines of “Well, Al, I talked to coach about what went
wrong in the first half, and he said that those eight interceptions really hurt them offensively.” Or maybe, “John, we
noticed that Moe Williams has changed his shoes four times in three quarters, here’s why...”

No one cares. After watching women report from the NFL sidelines for years, I’ve noticed that they are getting progressively
dumber. Women sideline commentators weren’t always this stupid. When Pam Oliver started at Fox in the mid-nineties, she wasn’t just
a “sideline reporter;” she was a great sports reporter. She had choice interviews with coaches and players on and off
the field. It was a huge accomplishment for women sports reporters everywhere; women had never before reported NFL games for
a major network. But the story goes downhill from there.

In 1998, ABC decided to add Lesley Visser to their Monday Night Football cast specifically as a “sideline reporter.” Although
she didn’t know much about sports, her husband Dick Stockton was a sports commentator, so she must know something, right?
Wrong. She was the beginning of the female sideline reporter stereotype. Sex appeal has become a more and more important
component in choosing women sideline reporters. Melissa Stark replaced Lesley Visser because of her girl-next-door good looks. She actually knew
about football, and an equal balance between looks and intelligence was achieved. Then she got pregnant, and that definitely was
not sexy to ABC, so out she went.

And now we have Lisa Guerrero. An ex-cheerleader for the Rams, minor soap star, and aspiring choreographer with admittedly no
real knowledge of football, she must be perfect for the job! I am beginning to wonder who’s dumber, the woman
sideline reporter or the network slob who actually hires her.

Now every aspect of sideline reporting is highly regulated by network bigwigs. They decide what questions are acceptable to ask
and often feed questions to the reporters. They also have final say on the wardrobes of the female commentators. That
explains some of the odd outfit choices I have seen on the sideline. Who wears a sweater set to a
football game? More importantly, who wears a sweater set to a football game in Green Bay in early December? I’m
waiting for the day when we just hand a Sports Illustrated swimsuit model a microphone and let her pace the
sidelines wearing her bikini.

The role of female reporters is a reflection of society, or what networks think society wants to see. Sadly, it’s
a damning reflection. When did looks become more important than intelligence for female sports reporters? That doesn’t seem to be
a concern with male commentators. There is a huge double standard between male and female NFL commentators, and women have
been relegated to the sidelines while men report the games from the box. Sadder still, we have regressed. What used
to be an accomplishment for women is now an embarrassment. In effect, networks are “dumbing down” their female sports reporters.
It’s not annoying that these women are such stupid sideline reporters; it’s annoying that this is what we settle for.
