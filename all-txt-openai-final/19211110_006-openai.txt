DAVIDSON IS PROUD OF DR. BEN R. LACY

Dr. B. R. Lacy, ‘06, was born in Raleigh, N.C., in August, 1886. His family is well known in North
Carolina history, his father being state treasurer and his grandfather having been president of Davidson College from 1855-61. His father
married Miss Mary Burwell, of a prominent family, and of this union there have been seven children, two sons and
five daughters. The other son, T. A. Lacy, is a senior in college.

Dr. Lacy graduated from the Morson and Denson Preparatory School of Raleigh and in the fall of 1902 he entered
Davidson College. He made a letter as end on the football team his last year and played on the basketball
team several years and managed it in his Senior year. He was a member of the Eumenean Literary Society and
the Kappa Alpha fraternity.

After graduation in 1906 he taught school in Decatur, Ga., for two years. Then in September, 1908, he went as
a Rhodes Scholar to England. He studied over there three years and then came back and in 1911 entered Union
Theological Seminary of Richmond, Va. He studied there four years, taking the three-year course and then accepting the Hoge Fellowship
for another year’s work. In the early summer of 1914 he took a trip to Palestine and came back through
Europe, being caught in the rush of war preparation.

From 1914 to 1917 he was assistant pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Raleigh, N.C. On July 13, 1917,
he was commissioned chaplain with the rank of captain in the First North Carolina Field Artillery. Then on August 5,
1917, when this regiment was mustered into the Federal Army he was recommissioned by President Wilson. The command became the
113th Field Artillery of Thirtieth Division and trained at Camp Sevier from September 15, 1917, to March 19, 1918. It
served overseas from May 26, 1918, to March 19, 1919. Captain Lacy served in the engagements at St. Mihiel and
the Argonne, and in the defense of the Woerve and Toul sectors. He was cited for bravery in administering first
aid while under shell fire. He was discharged April 15, 1919.

In May, 1919, he married Miss Emma White, daughter of the pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Raleigh. In
the same month at the commencement of Davidson College the degree of D.D. was conferred upon him. He accepted a
call to the pastorate of the Central Presbyterian Church of Atlanta, Ga., which pastorate he still holds. Dr. Lacy will
be the principal speaker here on November 11th for the Armistice Day program.

PROGRESS ON “QUIPS AND CRANKS” IS ENCOURAGING

When the Davidsonian reporter visited the different members of the Quips and Cranks staff, he found them all optimistic over
the prospects for a good annual this year. Of course, it’s a little early to say just what’s what, but
Rod Shaw, the Editor-in-Chief, stated that all the departments were getting well underway with their work. The personal histories are
nearly all in and almost all the senior write-ups have been completed. D. L. Mahood, in charge of the literary
department, stated that some of the class histories and poems had been written. He asks that anyone having any short
poems of campus interest, turn them in to him as soon as possible. Johnnie Curry is hard at work on
the “Wildcat Weekly” which is to be the fun department of the annual. He also requests that anyone having a
good joke or story turn it in to him. This is a very important department of the annual and this
year it is hoped to make it better than ever. McIlwaine reports that the art work is almost complete. There
are a number of good artists in school this year and they have gotten up some clever drawings. Ray Doubles
will have a top-notch Athletic department. The staff decided to dedicate this year’s annual to our mothers and especially our
“College Mother,” Mrs. Robson. The faculty again this year approved the giving of three dollars by each student to help
meet the expenses of publishing the annual. The engraving is to be done by the Bureau of Engraving, Minneapolis. With
the cooperation of all, this year’s Quips and Cranks will be one of the best yet.

Championship Contest Grows More and More Interesting.

Senior-Junior Game.

Wednesday night the Senior quintet, last year’s champions, lost their second game of the season to the tune of 36
to 16 in a vain attempt to down the promising Junior crew. The game was fast and hard-fought throughout but
especially so during the second half. Time and time again Referee Chalmers was forced to call fouls on both sides.
When the first half ended the score stood 12 to 10 in favor of the Juniors. The Seniors came back
with a rush in the second half and tied the score but from then on they were hopelessly outclassed. As
soon as a Senior forward would attempt to shoot, a Junior guard would be on him and invariably would break
up his shot. In all, it was the Junior’s night and cheer leader Crawford kept up the pep of the
Junior supporters throughout the entire game. It would be hard to name the individual stars of the evening but for
the Juniors, Mauze outshone his teammates. He was a wizard at finding the basket, his long shots and uncanny accuracy
in shooting fouls counting for a goodly number of the Junior points. Houghton also played a good game. For the
Seniors, Ormond, Doubles, and Price showed up well. The line-up and score was:

Juniors (36) Seniors (16)
Houghton (10) — — — — Ormond (2)
Brake (4) — — — — Doubles (10)
Mauze (12) — — — — Giese
Freeman (0) — — — — Covington (8)
Price (2)
Neal (2)
Substitutes: Seniors, Tufts for Freeman.
Fouls shot: Juniors, Mauze 6 out of 8. Seniors, Ormond 0 out of 4.
Referee: Chalmers.

Senior-Fresh Game.

The Senior five defeated the Freshmen in a hard-fought game Friday night by the score of 41 to 29. The
upperclassmen went into the fray determined to even up the count, as the Fresh defeated them in their previous encounter
by one point. The victory put the Seniors again in the lead for class basketball honors, but the three other
class teams are still fighting hard, and the present standing may be upset before long. However, the Seniors at present
look like the best bet for carrying away the coveted honor. The first half was fast and hard-fought, but the
guarding was close, and not until the last few minutes were the Seniors able to forge ahead by several baskets.
But from the opening of the last half to the final whistle, Captain Ormond’s men played a classy brand of
ball which kept the Freshmen puzzled and soon the upperclassmen had piled up enough points to put them out of
danger. Here the Scrubs were put in, the Freshmen took on new life and the encounter almost developed into a
“battle royal,” but the time was too short for them to do serious damage. Ormond was the chief point-getter of
the frolic, paving the way with six field goals, besides playing a classy floor game. Neal's shooting was nothing short
of spectacular. For the Freshmen, Beall tossed seven through the hoop from the field with Staley as next high man.

Line-up and summary:
Position. Seniors (41) Freshmen (29)
Ormond (13) Staley (9)
Doubles (6) — — — Beall (14)
Cornelson (2) — — — Anderson (6)
Price (8) — — — Koenig (0)
Neal (12) — — — Morrison (0)
Field goals: Beall (7), Ormond (6), Neal (6), Staley (4), Price (4), Doubles (3), Anderson (3), Cornelson (1).
Fouls: Ormond one out of five. Staley one out of six. Anderson 0 out of three.
Scorer: Bill Mauze.
