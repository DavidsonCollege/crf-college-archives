The DAVIDSONIAN, Sept. 24, 1919

Forceful Address Delivered by “Tim” Pharr

The “Follow Me Life” Subject of Interesting Talk

“Tim” Pharr's heartfelt talk to the Y. M. C. A. Sunday evening was well honored by special music rendered by several of the students. ‘Tim’ himself could not have been better introduced, since Mrs. Lingle had invited the band to conduct the affair at her home; not content with that, Mrs. Lingle and Mrs. Arbuckle added still further to the pleasure of the company by making a very welcome contribution to the refreshments.

After the “feed” the members and guests adjourned to the porch, where they were entertained by speeches and anecdotes by freshmen and others. Many of the freshmen seemed very much embarrassed when called on by President Calhoun, but there was no lack of good examples for them—both Dr. Lingle and Dr. Richards, guests of the band, told some excellent stories. Matthews, of the “Livest Wire,” told one of his “Jew” stories that provoked considerable laughter.

The band met for the first time as a Presbytery last Sunday afternoon. C. A. McGirt presided as moderator. After the opening exercises, the sessions of each dormitory met for short conferences. The moderator then called for a report from each session. R. C. Bitzer represented Rumple, while W. C. Neel spoke for Chambers and F. N. Manning and W. P. Cumming made short talks for Rumple. All the talks dealt with the aims of the Ministerial Band and the best ways to accomplish them.

It was decided that the band should meet hereafter as a Presbytery twice a month and on the alternating Sundays as a regular Ministerial Band. 6:01 p.m. was set as the time for the meetings, and the moderator announced that the meetings would begin at 6:10 sharp, whether anyone else arrived or not. The meeting closed with a general discussion of the aims of the band and the best ways to achieve them.

Rumple expressed the deepest admiration for Quarterback “Tiny” Graham, who always gave his best for Old Davidson, and never more cheerfully than in that hard-fought V. M. I. Thanksgiving game when he was knocked out with a broken leg. The University of Virginia never had a finer man than “Bobby” Gouch, who became a Rhodes scholar at Oxford and there volunteered in a French Ambulance Unit of No Man’s Land to give a dying man Jesus Christ's sacrifice to save us all from sin, from selfishness, from all that drags downward. We owe our lives, our all to Him.N. NEEL, Agents No. 30 and 26 Chambers

Fresh Meats

ONE GRADUATE of our Training School for Life Insurance Salesmen recently produced $308,090 in forty-five days. During the same period twenty-eight Training School men produced $2,594,000, an average of $92,000 per man. When an agent signs a contract with the Southern Life and Trust Company, we don’t pat him on the back, turn him loose and tell him to “go to it.” We give him a preliminary correspondence course, and then a course in our Training School at the Home Office, and then keep in touch with him and help him overcome his weak points and strengthen his strong points. As a result, our Training School men are making good. Drop us a line and ask us to give you full particulars.
