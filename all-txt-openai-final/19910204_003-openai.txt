THE DAVIDSONIAN MONDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 1991

A lot of campus rapes start here.

Whenever there's drinking or drugs, things can get out of hand. So it's no surprise that many campus rapes involve
alcohol.

But you should know that under any circumstances, sex without the other person's consent is considered rape. A felony, punishable
by prison. And drinking is no excuse. That's why, when you party, it's good to know what your limits are.
You see, a little sobering thought now can save you from a big problem later.
