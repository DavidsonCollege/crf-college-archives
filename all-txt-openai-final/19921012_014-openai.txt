Football

yard Fassett field goal kept the Wildcats fairly close, but Davidson simply could not regain enough momentum to pose a
serious threat.

Kevin Holzworth and Howell shared the quarterbacking duties for Davidson, passing for a combined 152 yards and rushing for another
112. Mike Wright rushed fifteen times for a hard-earned forty-three yards, and Dan Lamar caught six passes for 65 yards.
The three turnovers, however, significantly hurt Davidson’s offensive chances.

“Going into today’s game, we felt these two teams were evenly matched, with us at 1-3 and Washington and Lee
at 1-2,” Davidson coach Dave Fagg said. “We found out, however, that we were not. They beat us in every
way possible - offensively, defensively, and on special teams.” Davidson’s record now stands at 1-4, and the Wildcats must regroup
and prepare to meet Methodist next Saturday in Fayetteville.

Soccer

Cougars, like the ‘Cats, try to push the ball up the field in a hurry, and look to a big
gun for scoring. The big gun, junior Clay Smith, had tallied 20 points in his first ten games. Alas, the
offensive fireworks didn’t materialize, especially for Charleston. The Davidson defense, led by Omli and Tommy Suter, held Smith and his
mates in check, and the ‘Cats used second half goals from Lance Kinerk and Ukrop to win 2-0.

After a scoreless first half, CofC put nearly continuous pressure on the Davidson goal for several minutes early in the
second half. But Alex Deegan had all the answers for the ‘Cats in goal, including a marvelous save on Smith
in which he punched the ball over the crossbar to deny him a goal.

With under 30 minutes to play, the momentum changed hands. Davidson nearly scored on a pretty cross from Ukrop to
Ben Hayes, and then found the net in an unlikely manner. Stopper Lance Kinerk blasted the ball from the right
side of the field about 35 yards out, “pretty much,” as he put it, “trying to put it on goal,”
and ended up beating the keeper with it.

Ukrop, after a number of missed scoring opportunities, got the insurance goal (14, 59) on a feed from Sampers with
2:04 to play.

The Cougars (6-4-1) boasted a win over #25 William and Mary (which tied UCLA) and a tie with #12 Furman,
and Slagle was understandably happy to get a quality win. “These are the kind of teams we’ve got to beat
to have a chance for a [NCAA] bid,” he said.

Davidson (6-2-3) hosts Southern Conference cellar-dweller VMI (outscored 38-16 in its first nine games) Wednesday at 7:00 p.m. Over Fall
Break, the team travels to Los Angeles for games with #2 UCLA and Cal State-Fullerton.

Hankins

Hundley believes Hankins’ continued success hinges on adjusting mentally to her early-season point total. “I don’t think she’s really got
a scorer’s mentality, but somebody’s got to be in the right place to score goals, and they keep track of
things like that,” he noted.

Though she has proven to be a dominant force early in her Davidson career, Hankins continues to place the team
ahead of personal glory. “The rankings are nice, but the team winning is more important,” she said.
