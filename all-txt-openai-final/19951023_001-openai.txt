Politicians
to debate at
Davidson

Local candidates will address
town-college relations

By Adam Hickey
Staff Writer

Students won’t have to leave
campus to hear 12 of the 15 candi-
dates for Davidson’s public office
speak about campaign issues on
Monday.

At 7 p.m., students, faculty,
and townspeople will convene in
the 900 Room to listen to short
speeches given by each candidate.

Organizers hope that involv-
ing students in local politics will
narrow the gap between the col-
lege and the town. The SGA and
College Union are cosponsoring
the event, which will include a
reception afterward.

Event organizer Ann Williams
received the idea in August from
Jane Avinger, a current member of
the Board of Commissioners who
is not running for reelection.
Avinger felt that new faculty liv-
ing in the Davidson community
and a full slate of candidates war-
ranted the forum.

Williams presented the idea
to SGA Vice President Warren
Buford. Buford later obtained of-
ficial SGA sanctioning for the com-
mittee through the Senate Execu-
tive Committee.

Buford feels the SGA is the
appropriate organization to spon-
sor the event because of its duty to
“bridge the gap between commu-
nity and students.”

He perceives that “students
are removed from the community,”
and hopes this will involve them
more in local issues.
Buford noted that the Board

International House
offers atmosphere

By KIRSTEN RECKNAGEL
Staff Writer

Davidson’s proposed Interna-
tional House is an idea whose time
has finally arrived, say its support-
ers.

The International House
would not be a residence facility.
It would instead be a place where
all students could go to study or
hang out in an international atmo-
sphere.

Offering spacious rooms, a
back porch, and a lounge in which

OKTOBERFEST

The women of Warner Hall threw a pumpkin-carvin’ bash this past
Saturday night to celebrate the glorious autumn weather and the spirit
of Halloween. Not only did the Wappa Happas have a bluegrass band
playing, pumpkins to carve, and beer to drink—they also roasted two
piglets and a turkey. Look for the jack-o-lanterns smashed round campus.

Knox rated “best landlord”

By JOANNA JOHNSON
Assistant News Editor

Former and current students
who live on Scherer Street are
happy with their landlord. They
say Buster Knox is dependable and
efficient and is not only committed
to his landlord responsibilities, but
dedicated to his tenants, too.

LANDLORD
SERIES

Knox made an early impres-
sion on two of his former tenants
who report that he personally
turned on their water the day they
arrived. Generally, tenants have to
wait two days for the water com-
pany to turn faucets on.

“It wasn’t a big deal,” these
tenants describe, “but he went out
of his way to do it.”

When these same tenants’
house was broken into, Knox re-
sponded immediately. He came
the next morning, fixed the lock,
and didn’t charge them.

According to several renters,
Knox was eager to fix anything
and never expected them to pay,
even though tenants say they often
complained about “anal things”
such as changing light bulbs.

One tenant explained Knox’s
quick response to his request for
extra keys. When other renters
complained that rain turned their
driveway into a “mud slick,” Knox
had the driveway covered with
gravel.

They also recall him person-
ally fixing a sewer problem and
doing other “little things that made
a big difference.” One tenant who
also dealt with Wilson Sadler was
especially happy with Knox’s dedi-
cation. “It was a trauma and a half
to get Sadler to fix anything,” she
said.

Knox trusts Davidson students
especially because of the school’s
reputation for attracting “respon-
sible and mature” people. Resi-
