#### Wildcats Finish Last Against Tough Competition

The Davidson men’s track and field team traveled to UNC Charlotte last Saturday for a small, five-team meet in preparation
for the upcoming conference tournament. The Wildcats competed against Charlotte, Wake Forest University, NC State, and East Carolina, placing fifth
among tough competition.

Senior Jay Jahnes came through with the highest place for the Wildcats last weekend, finishing fifth in the 800-meter run
in a time of 1:54.10. The time puts Jahnes within the top-ten list at Davidson and is fast enough to
place him in the top three in the current conference standings. Jimmy Swansbrough followed Jahnes in the 800-meter with a
season-best time of 1:59.34. Freshman Kevin Bell was the lone Wildcat in the 1500-meter run, placing sixth with a time
of 4:13.25.

It was a Wildcat pack that finished in the 3000-meter run. Sophomore Ben Gaspar led the Davidson runners in a
time of 8:57.94, followed by teammates Dave Bunge, Brad Becken, and Chris Schmader.

Junior Freddie Bowie had Davidson’s top finish in the sprinting events, placing sixth in the 400-meter run with a time
of 53.08. He was followed by teammates Chris Rouisse and David Oyler in times of 53.20 and 53.88, respectively. Bowie
also competed in the 200-meter with a time of 24.77, finishing behind freshman John Leverett with a time of 23.33.

Drew Weber led the Wildcats in the hurdling events, competing in both the 110-meter and 400-meter hurdles. He had a
time of 16.83 in the 110-meter hurdles and 57.76 in the 400-meter hurdles. Teammate Johannes Norling also ran the 400-meter
hurdles, finishing with a time of 59.12.

The Wildcats will look to make a strong impression at next week’s conference tournament, April 18-20 at Eastern Tennessee State
University.

Senior Dan Gibson, recently named the Southern Conference runner of the week, will look to lead the Wildcats on the
track. He is currently the leader in the conference standings in the 1500-meter. With additional strong runners Greg Scott, Greg
Schernecke, and Jahnes, the Wildcats will certainly have a major impact on conference competition.

Davidson had never participated in this regatta, so the members only had a vague idea of how stiff the competition
would be. While there were some extremely strong programs at Occoquan, five out of six of Davidson’s boats managed to
finish in the top three.

Unlike most regattas, Occoquan does not have preliminary heats followed by finals for the boats that place in the top
of their heats. Instead, the regatta coordinators simply divide the boats into heats and then award a gold medal to
the boat that finishes first in each heat.

This lack of finals proved frustrating for some of Davidson’s rowers. For example, even though the varsity men finished solidly
in second place with a time of 7:10.0, there was not a finals event for them to compete against the
top finishers from the other heats.

Despite practicing in conditions they had not prepared for, the novice men finished fourth in their heat. The novice women’s
boats also did remarkably well, coming in second and third in their respective heats. Most of the novice women felt
extremely positive about this race and are happy to see that their dedication is finally paying off. As Katie Bennett
’05 said, “We showed huge improvement over our first regatta. Walking boats finally made me realize why I’ve been [working
so hard] all season.” Freshman Kim Newton agreed, “It makes me realize that with hard work, great people, and a
common goal, anything is possible. Next time, we’ll be even better.”

The men’s pair came in an impressive second place, barely holding off the boat from Carnegie Mellon that finished just
one second behind them. Brian Nickerson ’04 commented that he was very happy with their race, because it proved once
again that the rowers’ dedication and hours of practice are paying off.

“We worked hard over Easter,” said Nickerson, “and we know that if you work hard, you get results.”
