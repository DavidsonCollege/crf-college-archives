"Thus when Pakistan lost the war, the U.S. lost some of her good relations with India," said Gaige. The Indian
government then “cracked down" on American education programs and refused to give its approval for the Davidson program. They also
terminated a number of programs that had already been in operation, such as those conducted by Carleton College and Wooster
College.
