**Tensile-Tailed Creature Joins Union Desk Staff**

By RICK VON UNWERTH
Davidsonian Feature Editor

The staff of the David Ovens Student Union has made a rather unique, though undeniably valuable, addition to its staff.
A bright yellow female squirrel monkey now occupies a position of state on the Union information desk. Her primary function
is, allegedly, to handle the majority of student questions. Only the most difficult will find their way to Mrs. Carol
Cooke.

The monkey was originally rented to act as an organ-grinder’s flunky. She indicated, however, that this was beneath her dignity
by snapping at the fingers of several of her detractors. C. Shaw Smith and the committeemen of the Union have
recently voted to retain the malodorous monster as mascot. The Union employees agree that “She has gotten more attention than
any other single display we've had so far.”

The monkey, so far, has sustained herself admirably on a diet of Purina Monkey Chow, interspersed with cigarette filters, jaw
flies, lettuce, fingernails, and a pencil eraser spotted here and there for spice. When the animal was approached by the
DAVIDSONIAN, she was resting in relative comfort atop her house with one finger in her ear and the other fondling
her tail. Throughout the interview, the monkey remained exasperatingly aloof, changing her position only occasionally to scratch her nether regions.

No plans have been announced for the monkey after the termination of her mascotship. She will take temporary lodging in
the psychology laboratory, and it is rumored that she will participate in some behavior experiments later this year.

125th Year Plans Feature Dedication

Through the coming year, the college will be emphasizing 1-2-5 in its programs and publicity. This is the 125th anniversary
year of the founding of the school. The highlight of the year-long celebration will come during the week of October
23-28, Robert Sailstad, assistant to the president, announced today. At that time, the John R. Cunningham Music and Fine Arts
Building will be dedicated. The occasion will be marked by the first dramatic presentation to be given in the new
auditorium. The Board of Visitors will be on campus the same week, and Charles A. Dana is also expected to
attend the dedication. Other programs, highlighting the 1-2-5 idea, will be sponsored throughout the year. The college has already organized
a 1-2-5 Club in the Charlotte area. Composed of alumni and friends of the college, the club will hold four
luncheons this fall at the Charlottetown Mall. Each meeting will feature a brief program on some aspect of the college.
They are scheduled for Sept. 19, Oct. 9, Nov. 7, and Dec. 4. No reservations are necessary for any of
the luncheons. Membership cards also stress that no dues or fund-raising is involved.

Parking Lots, Buildings Appear

The Fine Arts Building, parking areas, and faculty housing were three areas in which work was done to improve Davidson's
physical facilities this summer. Yesterday, a final inspection of the building was planned to be carried out by Mr. Currie,
Mr. Meetze, and Dr. Martin with the contractors. Since all the equipment for the building will not arrive until after
the 15th, it will not be fully completed until then. The sound and stage equipment is now in the process
of being installed and permanent seating in the auditorium will be put in starting Monday. New parking lots were put
in and are being worked on across from the Pi Kappa Phi house, around and across from the Fine Arts
Building, and at the north end of Chambers. Also, the road opposite the Sigma Chi house was widened. This road
leads to a parking lot for the new golf range to be opened later this month. A new faculty duplex
opposite the north campus entrance was completed this summer and now houses two families. Land was also purchased south of
Concord Rd. for faculty housing. Arrangements will be completed late this month to offer lots for sale to faculty members.

Scott Announces New PE Program Requirements

A new change in requirements of the Davidson College physical education program exempting some 30 juniors and seniors from extended
participation in the program was passed unanimously last Friday by the Davidson Faculty. Dr. Tom Scott, athletic director, requested the
change “to try to get the boys out by the end of their sophomore year” and Dean of the Faculty
Frontis W. Johnston recommended it at Friday’s meeting. Another provision passed by the Faculty expands the quarter-long fundamentals classes for
freshmen who fail to pass the physical test to run the entire first semester. “It seems,” said Dr. Scott, “that
there has been a trend recently to let those boys go when they fail the swimming and fundamentals tests repeatedly.
They become disinterested in the work and tend to overcut.”

PURPOSE

The changes are intended “to help the fundamentals student a little and let juniors and seniors use that extra hour
to study.” However, if a physical education student overcuts his classes, he still is required to attend an extra semester.
Dr. Scott said about 25 juniors and two or three seniors are excused from physical education this year under the
change. Heretofore, a portion of the fundamentals requirement — swimming — has been pursued one day a week. A change
last year extends swimming practice to three days a week.

OLD PROGRAM

Physical education at Davidson is a two-year requirement. Until last week, a student who failed to fulfill the requirement by
the end of his sophomore year was forced to attend classes through his junior and senior years, if necessary. The
previous rule establishing the length of fundamentals training had been in effect for six years. Upon their arrival on campus,
freshmen undergo tests to determine their skills in several fundamental athletic exercises — softball throw, obstacle sprint, 100-yd. dash, football
kick and bar snaps, among others — and those who fail to accumulate the required number of points must retake
the tests until they pass. Some students never manage to pass. The new change is directed to their advantage.
