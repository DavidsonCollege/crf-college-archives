**Smith Gallery exhibits “Dissections”**

By ERIN RAFFETY

Perhaps in all the buzz of the art opening at the Visual Arts Center here at Davidson a few weeks
ago, it is understandable that many people missed stepping inside the Edward M. Smith Gallery, the room across from the
faculty show. Still, the Smith Gallery, which presents Susan Brenner’s recent paintings on paper through October 10th, 2001, is worth
visiting.

Brenner, who holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts from San Francisco Art Institute and a Master of Fine Arts from
the University of Southern California, currently teaches at UNC-Charlotte as an Associate Professor of Art. Ms. Brenner is the recipient
of numerous faculty research grants at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte and has participated in many lectures and
panel discussions with distinguished artists and galleries across the country.

Brenner’s current exhibit here at Davidson is a collection of smaller paintings, which like most of her art, express and
suggest human anatomy though “less directly figurative” than her past work.

The collection is a myriad of cords and coils, cages and curves, intricate, colorful, and symbolic. At times Brenner’s work
is rope-like and rosy; the next, dotted and spotted. Overall this exhibit displays more earthy tones: pinks, reds, and oranges,
suggesting warmth and womb. Ms. Brenner brings as much attention to the background as to the foreground, often fusing the
positive with the negative. “My handling of the paint purposely ranges from loosely ‘realistic,’ to fairly schematic or abstract, to
references to specific historical styles,” says Brenner. “Both image and paint are intended to play with perception and stimulate associations
with physical experience.”

Brenner succeeds in this effort by using “areas of paint that refer to internal organs” as well as cellular structures
or references to the circulatory and nervous systems. A two-by-four grid of small paintings on the south wall of the
gallery contains references to the embryo, the brain, ribs, pelvis, and variations on these. The three-by-four grid on the opposite
wall contains suggestions of brain, vessels, veins, and intestines. Still, the body parts and images are deeply idealized and glorified.
On the opposite side of the door to the gallery, on the north wall, pink, purple, and blue ropes crowd
a dark heart-like indication of body. Brenner overall traverses the boundary of inner and outer structure, at the same time
deeply involving the psychological.

Perhaps the focal point of the exhibit is the large paintings arranged in a two-by-three grid on the east wall
of the gallery. Brenner has repeated the image of a coiled rope yet presented it differently each time, in terms
of coloring, and her separation of the background and foreground. Still, the coil, which she chose for its “flexibility and
fluidity,” is always prominent. Beyond it, like in many of the paintings, Brenner causes the background to “disconnect” at some
point, like photos ill-aligned, spliced, separated. The effect is startling, and the entire exhibit is well worth a second walk
over to the VAC.

**Davidson Concert Series presents: The Ahn Trio**
9/21/01 - Love Auditorium 8:00 pm

The phenomenal success of the new CD on EMI Classics, Ahn Plugged, is no surprise to the many fans of
the Ahn Trio. They launched their latest CD with music composed by Kenji Bunch, Astor Piazzolla, Leonard Bernstein, Eric Ewazen,
Michael Nyman, and David Bowie at Joe’s Pub in New York City on two successive nights. A sold-out crowd on
both nights prompted a second engagement in September. This season, the trio adds South America to its list of concert
tours. When the Ahns are not performing in New York, California, or Europe, they are much sought after by the
press. Appearances in GQ, Vogue, and the national book, Best Friends, are now common.
