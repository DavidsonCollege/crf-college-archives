**Endowment Grows**

The endowment of Davidson College has passed the $30 million mark, according to an announcement by Davidson College President Samuel R. Spencer Jr.

Spencer noted that Davidson’s endowment was just over $1 million in 1941, at the start of World War II. It passed the $2 million mark in 1951, $5 million in 1958, $10 million in 1966, and $20 million in 1978.

A 1981 study by the National Association of College and University Business Officers ranks Davidson 30th among the nation’s liberal arts colleges in terms of the value of endowment. Dartmouth leads the list, with an endowment of $234,055,000, more than $100 million above second-place Wellesley.

**International Food Fest Held**

By MIKE TANTILLO ’85

The International Festival, featuring representative food and music from over a dozen countries, invaded the Union Patio last Saturday.

About 75-100 students sampled the various foods. Sophomore Edwin Evans said, “The food is incredible; it gives my tastebuds a new, international perspective. I would like to see more things along these lines.” Senior Trig Adams said, “It was all wonderful. We try to get foreign students incorporated into our society, but we don’t really do a lot to understand foreign cultures, so things like this are a good idea.”

Geoff Andrews, a dual citizen of the United States and the Bahamas, brought back conchols and conch fritters that his mother made during Thanksgiving break. Maria Nicolaides fixed baklava, a Greek dessert. Shirin Hanafi and Ambreen Fraser served samosas, a Pakistani snack. Fraser said, “The festival was really good, watching all the people was very interesting, and a lot of my friends got involved in helping make the food.”

Laura Terry, who made and served French crêpes, said, “The festival went really well. I’m glad we were able to have it outside—that way a lot of people saw it and just wandered over.”

Andres Sanz, who served a Spanish potato omelette, said, “The International Festival is a good idea, but food is not enough. In the spring festival, we should also try and have dancing and games.”

Yu Chienwen, from China, served egg rolls made with shrimp and vegetables. Chienwen said, “The Festival was a good chance for a cultural exchange and to intermingle with the American students. Things like this help bring us closer to the American students.” David Taylor, who was JYA at St. Andrews last year, added shortcake from Scotland.

**Davidson Receives Computer Grant**

The Jessie Ball duPont Religious, Charitable and Educational Fund of Jacksonville, Fla., has granted Davidson College $103,100 for the purchase of computer equipment.

The duPont grant will allow Davidson to buy 20 additional terminals, three printers, and more memory and software for its Prime 750 academic computer installed last summer. Eventually, the College expects to install 200 terminals around campus.

Established in 1976 with funds from the estate of Mrs. Jessie Ball duPont, the Fund supports colleges, social welfare programs, cultural programs, churches, and health associations.

Davidson has received more than $350,000 from the duPont Fund for scholarships, renovation of the Martin Science building, and furnishings for the Commons. The College named a private dining room in the Vail Commons for Mrs. duPont.

**Class of ’83 Plans Gift**

By ANN MEADOR ’85

The Class of 1983 has decided on a gift for Davidson.

According to Class President Sherburne Laughlin, a pledge of $100,000 to be used for scholarships will be presented to the College at next spring’s graduation ceremonies.

To reach this goal, the class will campaign among its members, asking for individual pledges of one percent of each member’s gross adjusted income for the five years following graduation. Laughlin said they hope to achieve 100 percent participation from the class.

The class will present a check for $100,000 to Davidson at its fifth reunion. The money will be used to augment the financial aid packages of students who have already received some financial aid.

The presentation of the class gift will coincide with the sesquicentennial of the College.

**$78,226 Already Pledged in SGA Phonathon**

Davidson on the line

By THURSTON HATCHER ’85

With one night still remaining, the combined efforts of the SGA, the Development Office, and over 400 Davidson students have led to $78,226 in total pledges from the third annual SGA Phonathon.

Last year the Phonathon produced $127,000 in total pledges and $140,000 in actual donations. Lee McCormick, co-chairman with Ken Krieg and McNair Helm, says that this year’s Phonathon is running about even with last year, in spite of the economy. One major accomplishment is the gaining of 10 percent more donors every night.

For the first time, the Phonathon staff used computers this year to help with the extensive tabulations and cross-references. Problems persisted with the computer programs for the first few days, but, says McCormick, “after a little work we got it running smoothly.”

According to McCormick, the Phonathon was initiated three years ago with a threefold purpose. The major reason is to increase totals of gifts and new donors. A second reason is to help establish rapport between students past and present. Finally, the activity helps volunteering students and the alumni who are phoned realize the importance of giving and keeping the living endowment strong.

McCormick estimates that the 1982 Phonathon will contact over 2,000 alumni and parents of current students before it ends.

The Phonathon Staff wants to thank all students from the various participating houses, fraternities, and organizations. Night totals are as follows:

PiKA: $15,877
PAX/Emanon: $7,095
Rusk/Warner Hall: $10,643
KA: $9,255

Andrew Wilson and John Lyday pretend to phone someone.

ETC/Sig Ep/ATO: $10,613
Fiji/F & M: $16,786
SAE: $7,957

Phi Delt and the BSC will call tonight.
