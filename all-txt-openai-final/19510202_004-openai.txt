North Fulton Choir
To Present Program
At Davidson High

The special choir of North Fulton High School in Atlanta, appearing here under the sponsorship of the P.-T.A. music committee,
will present a varied program of choral works and solo numbers at the Davidson High School auditorium on Wednesday, February
7th at 7:30 p.m. This program will comprise three groups of selections taken from standard classic and semi-classic choral literature,
to be sung by the mixed choir of thirty-eight voices. These groups of choral works will be interspersed with solo
works and novelty numbers representative of the individual talents of the choir members, including violin solos, vocal solos, popular tunes
by the Tune-Timers, solo dances, and comic and humorous sketches done by an artist member to the accompaniment of accordion
music.

This group of thirty-eight boys and girls and their director, Mrs. Robert Lowrance, Jr., come representing a school in which
a fine music department offers opportunity for the student’s development in music appreciation and performance. Students are given credit for
participating in the school orchestra trained by a member of the Atlanta symphony, the band directed by a wind instrument
teacher who holds classes through the entire day, and the choir, as well as for the study of music courses
offered in the curriculum.

High quality of attainment, talent, and character are necessary in the boys and girls belonging to these organizations. Mr. Lowrance
bases qualification for membership in the choir on musicianship, conduct, personality, and scholarship. Students who are chosen to participate must
be passing in all work. Of the personnel of this group a year ago, half were on the school honor
roll.

The choir has this year been invited on an all-expense tour of Germany by the State Department.

Ticket sales for the program will be handled by the Annual staff of the Davidson High School.

Coed: Then let’s go home.

KA: That's not the word.
