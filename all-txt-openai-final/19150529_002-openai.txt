Hours: 7:00 to 7:30 P. M. EDITORIAL BOARD Exegesis at Union. The DAVIDSONIAN. May 29, 1915 DAVIDSON ALUMNI HONORED AT
UNION SEMINARY A recent letter from Dr. W. W. Moore contains a great deal of interest to all Davidson men.
Of first importance is Dr. Edward Mack's ('90 A.B., '87 A.M.) becoming McCormick Professor of Hebrew and Old Testament. For
the past eleven years Dr. Mack has been Professor of Old Testament study at Lane Theological Seminary, Cincinnati. His record
has been a brilliant one, as has that of his brother, Dr. William Mack, of New York. He won the
Hebrew fellowship at Princeton, took equally high rank at the University of Berlin. Since then he has served as pastor
of many of the largest churches of the Southern Presbyterian Church, and as teacher in Lane Seminary he became known
as "the most beloved minister in Cincinnati."

Of the fourteen men who have won the Moses D. Hoge Fellowship for Post-Graduate Study, established in 1901, the highest
distinction within the gift of Union Seminary, eight have been Davidson men: W. T. Thompson, Jr., R. K. Timmons, Robert
King, J. K. Parker, W. C. McLauchlin, B. R. Lacy, Jr., and, this year, L. R. Scott. Eleven of Davidson’s
men were graduated from Union this year: C. F. Arrowood, J. Brady, C. B. Craig, A. P. Dickson, Marion Huske,
H. M. McDiarmid, H. M. Shields, F. D. Thomas, Jr., and W. D. Wolfe.

EDITORIAL.
Commencement has ended. The girls have left, the fellows have gone, and the campus is deserted and quiet as these
words are being pounded out on the typewriter. That this issue may tell those who did not attend Commencement, of
its pleasures, and remind those who were present of their pleasures, that it may be a permanent record of the
days just past, for the Seniors just gone, and the friends who came to see them go, that it may
make you more loyal than ever to Davidson's weekly, to Davidson College and to the plans and ideals set for
her next year—this is the hope of those who have financed this special issue, and of those who have stayed
over to send it out.

ALUMNI FLOCK TO SUPPORT OF DAVIDSONIAN
Nothing is more gratifying to the editors and managers of The Davidsonian than the way in which the alumni are
coming to the support of the paper. Only one man approached on the campus this Commencement refused to subscribe. All
others were hearty in appreciation of the paper and came across at once with the long green. The Davidsonian can
boast of being unique among college weeklies in the support it receives from the alumni.

GIGNILLIAT WINS SIGNAL LITERARY HONOR
The Blue Pencil Club learned last week that one of its members, G. Gignilliat, won first place in the Annual
Prose Fiction Contest conducted by the Sigma Upsilon National Literary Fraternity. Fifteen universities and colleges were represented in this contest,
and so the honor is a signal one. The stories sent in were submitted to three judges, who graded them
carefully according to definite standards. Gignilliat received the highest grade, with Newman of North Carolina, coming second. The prize for
the winner of this contest is a Sigma Upsilon ring. Gignilliat’s prize-winning story was entitled “The Prisoner of Gerada.” It
appeared in practically the same form in the January-February Magazine, under the title “Thoughts.” In the judgment of many competent
critics, it is one of the most perfect short stories that has ever been written at Davidson.

RADICAL CHANGE IN ORDER OF GRYPHON
A complete change in its organization and work has been announced by the Order of the Gryphon. Its aims have
been to draw closer the bonds of friendship between classmates and to stimulate interest in the welfare of the college.
And it has been with a view to accomplishing more good for the college through quiet but purposeful work that
the order announces that hereafter its membership will not be made public and will be based upon merit alone. Work
for the upbuilding of the college and the molding of high ideals will henceforth be its aim, and the order
will be known in the future only in so far as it accomplishes this line.

R. W. Porter has been elected captain of the Gymnasium team for the next year, and R. H. Bennett, manager.

WEDNESDAY PROGRAM (Concluded from page 1)
That Davidson still claims Dr. Smith as her own, although he has moved to another State, was evidenced by the
enthusiastic ovation which he received as he stood to speak. The subject of his address was “A Widespread Campus Fallacy.”fallacious
campus creed which he sought to expose was, that to attain success in the fierce warfare of modern business demands
self-confidence, red-blooded vitality, and a knowledge of men and things rather than “book learning” and abstract scholarship. In fact, it
is generally believed that the students who make the highest marks are not so apt to win promotion and success
in the modern world as the all-round man who strives only after fair grades, and is thereby enabled to participate
more vigorously in the many organized activities of the college.

By means of clear and convincing statistics, Dr. Smith proved that wages are all the better for the educational training
received and increase in direct proportion to it. Holding for a moment the “Who’s Who” edition of 1911 in his
hand, the speaker ridiculed in a few sentences the advertising biographies of some current great men, for which as much
as $150 apiece are paid. Then, referring to “Who’s Who” of “Cold facts, not eulogy,” he presented the following figures:
Of the one million and three-fourths illiterates in the United States, not one has his name in “Who’s Who.” Of
twelve million men of common school training, one in 9,000 is so honored; of 650,000 high school trained, one in
400. College men, finally, have one chance in 40 to enter this roll of distinction. Figures from Yale, Harvard, Princeton,
Amherst, and Brown showed that men who take honors in college take honors in later life. The continued applause at
the close of Dr. Smith’s masterful address indicated that he had proved his point to the satisfaction of the audience.

MEDALS AWARDED.

Dr. Martin presented the debating trophy cup to the Eumenean Society, which won it this year over the Philanthropic. Three
medals were then awarded. Dr. John H. Rose, of Laurinburg, presented the William Banks Biblical medal for highest honors in
the three-year Bible course to W. A. McIlwaine. “There is one man of the six splendid speakers that we wish
to pat on the back—Mr. Patton,” said Rev. T. P. Burgess, in declaring J. G. Patton the winner of the
Junior Oratorical contest. The Faculty Orators’ medal to the winner of the Senior contest was presented to Norman Johnson.

ideals of service. G. W. Gignilliat delivered the Valedictory oration simply but beautifully, paying tribute to the noble influences of
the past year and hopefully of the future. Dr. Walter Lingle, President of the Board of Trustees, spoke encouragingly of
the accomplishments of the past year and hopefully of the future.

President Martin spoke at greater length of the new plans for enlarging and bettering Davidson, of the proposed endowment and
gymnasium. He then declared the year of work closed and announced that the next session would open Thursday, September 2,
1915. Dr. W. L. Lingle then pronounced the benediction, closing the seventy-eighth Commencement of Davidson College.

and Uncle Hiram present, through the marriage of Napoleon and Josephine under the Phi society chandelier, and the making of
the college seal by Marshal Ney, to the commencement of 1919, when Woodrow Wilson presented the new gymnasium, was portrayed.
Many well-known characters appeared under varying circumstances, some of them eliciting great applause.

GENERAL RECEPTION.

while Magazine plans were discussed for the next year. Four issues will be printed instead of the ordinary seven, and
it is hoped to make these much larger and better than ever before. H. Smith was elected editor of the
Magazine for the coming year. J. G. Patton had already been elected manager.
