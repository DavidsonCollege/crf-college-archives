**Martin: ‘Lot About This Place I Don’t Know’**

By CHARLES CHASTAIN
Davidsonian Associate Editor

“There’s an awful lot about this place that I don’t know,” Davidson College President D. Grier Martin told the DAVIDSONIAN
staff in an interview in his office Tuesday morning, before answering their questions on the problems and accomplishments of his
new administration. The following is the text of the interview:

**Question:** What comment would you have to make about the crowded dormitory conditions that are forcing people to live in
the gym? How did this problem arise?

**Answer:** I am unhappy about this. We didn’t plan to have enough students to make housing of that kind necessary
for longer than a very temporary period. We intended to have this year about 890 to 895 students. The way
these things work these days makes it impossible to know what you'll have. We had to go by past experience
and accept a large number of applications. Based on past percentages, we would have had a freshman class of 250
students. Another factor in the number we now have is the number of people who come back out of the
rising classes. In spite of the system of tuition deposits, it is still hard to tell. Apparently, we just had
a situation in which all these factors worked out to a maximum percentage. We will be doing everything we can
to rectify the situation. But there are some things we can’t do. We can’t build another dormitory immediately.

**Question:** Does this have anything to do with the Trustees’ idea of increasing enrollment to one thousand?

**Answer:** Yes.

**Question:** Then we made a bigger jump than intended?

**Answer:** Yes. We planned to increase enrollment this year to 895. Nobody had an idea of going as high as
nine hundred, which would be thirty more than last year. The plan was to go up to 930 next year.
We would then build a new dormitory, and the following year we would have 960 or 970.

**Question:** Are we going to try to even it out next year and take fewer students?

**Answer:** We will still try to follow the pattern and reach 930.

**Question:** Are the Trustees thinking of going up even further, say to 1200 or 1400?

**Answer:** You can’t speak for 54 men. The present limit of one thousand was reached by a joint committee of
Faculty and Trustees, and we might have gone higher without the opposition of some of the Faculty. The policy for
the time being is for one thousand students. We are now planning programs, including the Dana Science Building and the
new dormitory, in that direction. These programs all will be coordinated to take care of one thousand. If we go
beyond one thousand there are so many areas to be changed that I don’t think we would.

**Question:** Is anything going to be done soon about the science building?

**Answer:** We are hopeful to break ground on the science building in the next two weeks.

**Question:** Has the location of the new dormitory been decided?

**Answer:** No. The only ideas seriously proposed are to have it in the lot opposite Belk across the road, in
the area between the Union and Duke, or in the present parking area next to Belk.

**Question:** What about the size of the faculty? If we want to keep the same faculty-student ratio, wouldn’t we have
to hire more professors?

**Answer:** We will have to hire new professors. Whether we would have to have enough to keep the same ratio,
I would feel the areas which would have small classes could absorb some additional students to make up for overcrowded
areas. For example, geography—I assume we would not have to add another professor there. Many people think that the idea
of faculty-student ratio is exaggerated and that some subjects could be taught as well in large classes. That way professors
could be more efficient.

**High Enrollment Fills Classes Past Capacity**

By ERVIN S. DUGGAN

Crowded classrooms and lack of dormitory space plagued college authorities and students as classes opened on Wednesday. With the highest
enrollment in Davidson’s history, officials are faced with housing an overflow 915-man student body. Classrooms are filled beyond capacity. Gymnasium
showers and locker rooms were utilized last week to house over 30 upperclassmen. The college guest house and numerous private
homes are being opened to provide student housing, with 64 members of the student body rooming away from the college
campus. Mrs. Rethal Moore, supervisor of dormitories, expressed concern regarding the lack of campus space. “I feel sure, however, that
rooms will be available by the end of the first semester,” said Mrs. Moore.

Crowded conditions in classrooms brought sharp complaints from students and faculty. Section enrollment in some classes went as high as
90, with some students forced to find seats on radiators and classroom floors. The overflow enrollment, according to college authorities,
was caused by an increase in upperclass enrollment rather than in the size of the incoming freshman class. Freshman class
size is estimated at 257, three higher than last year. The enrollment of exchange students and an influx of returnees
were said to account for the overflow. A 1957 mandate of college trustees called for an increase in enrollment at
Davidson to reach 1000 students by 1960. Proposed new facilities to meet the demand, including a science building and dormitory,
are still in the project stage. Both the science building and proposed dormitory are scheduled for construction beginning in 1959.
Initial funds for construction were contributed by Charles Dana, president of the Dana Foundation.

Meanwhile, faculty members and college administrators attempt to ease campus crowding by shifts and balancings in class enrollments and room
assignments until all students are provided for.

**Davidson’s 915-man enrollment forced over thirty upperclassmen into the gym. These students attempt to study on their floor-level bunks in
a shower room. College officials hope to remedy the situation in the near future.**

**Bands Combine For Better Sounds**

Davidson College will have a new marching band, chiefly through the combined efforts of Mr. Frank West of the Music
Department and of Lt. Col. William L. Adams of the ROTC Department. Initiated, the football and ROTC bands will be
combined as a single unit and will perform in accordance with the activities of both the music and the ROTC
departments.

Previously, for a player to be in the ROTC and concert bands, he was required to play in the football
band. Under the present organization, however, the new band will play both for ROTC drill maneuvers and for football contests.
The band will be dressed in the new Army uniforms recently secured by the ROTC department. The coats are navy
blue with gold braid and buttons. The trousers are royal blue. All band cadets will wear white gloves, hats, scarves,
pistol belts, and leggings. Officers of the band are: Vernon Broyles, commander; Arthur Lawrence, assistant commander; and Perrin Wright, first
sergeant. The drum major will be appointed at a later date.

**Firebug Threatens Davidson Campus**

Charlotte police thwarted a possible arson attempt last Friday night with the arrest of Robert Conklin, a known firebug, who
was reportedly on his way to Davidson.

**YMCA**

Each student will be sent a letter explaining the purposes and program of the YMCA this year, along with a
description of this year’s organization and the activities of the “Y” during 1957-58. This information will also be sent to
the faculty and made available to citizens of Davidson through publication in the local newspaper, the Mecklenburg Gazette, in order
to encourage their participation in such facets of the YMCA as Winter Services, debates and speakers, etc.

**MEETING**

The membership drive will end with the year's first membership meeting on Tuesday, October 7. The “Y” will operate on
the largest budget in its history this year. $1,545 has been allotted for operating expenses and the program budget will
total $2,756, for a total of $4,205. It is expected that much of this will come from student donations, the
deficit to be made up by the college.

**PLEDGE**

During membership solicitation, each student will be given an opportunity to make a financial pledge. On Thursday, September 11, President
D. Grier Martin received a call from the Reverend John Wilson, pastor of the Presbyterian Church in Kannapolis. Rev. Wilson
reported that a student from Wake Forest College who was visiting in his congregation had seen Conklin’s picture.In a newspaper
and remembered meeting him on the Wake Forest campus. Conklin had stopped by the Kappa Alpha house and asked for
directions to Davidson College. Conklin’s question and his subsequent visit to Charlotte gave every indication that he had planned to
visit Davidson in order to set a fire or to engage in other destructive acts. President Martin commented after the
arsonist’s arrest, that the occurrence “might serve as a possible warning to all of us at Davidson regarding strangers who
may be visiting our campus.”

Students will have the choice of giving in weekly offerings, or of making a direct contribution, to be paid in
a lump sum during or after the membership drive. As in past years, the Y.M.C.A. will be governed by a
Board of Directors, which meets monthly to formulate general policy. In addition to the student executive officers—President Vernon Broyles, Vice
President “Smitty” Smith, Secretary Tom Colvin, and Treasurer Bobby Livingston—this year's board membership will consist of: Faculty members Dr. John
M. Bevan, Dr. Charles E. Ratliff, and Dr. Max E. Polley; three permanent members ex-officio, including President D. Grier Martin,
Dean John C. Bailey, and Dr. Samuel W. Newell, Jr., minister of the College Church; and non-voting staff member Dr.
George Staples. Also on the board are two additional student members, Roy Gilbert and George Hart, and Mr. Thomas Sadler,
a resident of the town of Davidson. Dr. Ratliff will be board chairman for 1958-59. Vice chairmen will be Dr.
Newell, and Dr. Staples will serve as secretary.

Fraternity members confer into the small hours of the morning as they decide on the final bids for the 1958
Rush Week. This afternoon pledging took place, after the first Orientation Week for the first time in Davidson history. Most
fraternities planned to follow up the pledging ceremonies with dinners or parties in the evening, followed by attendance at the
Davidson-Catawba game in Charlotte.

“What is your general impression of Rush Week and what, if anything, could be improved?” were questions posed to various
freshmen in the early part of the week. All those interviewed seemed to be having a good time and enjoyed
meeting all the fraternity men, even though they would like to know them better.

One of the more perceptive freshmen interviewed saw “a lot of artificiality,” even though he had “met a lot of
fine boys.” Another freshman failed to see much differentiation in the various fraternities.

Below are typical freshman comments on this year's Rush Week:

Jeff Couch—“Although they have been pretty hectic and a new experience for me, the parties have been a lot of
fun. I find it hard to meet all the members of the larger fraternities and to remember the names that
belong with familiar faces when I see them again on campus.”

Robert Jackson—"I like getting to know the upperclassmen both at the parties and when they come to my room. Their
help on professors and courses makes you feel that you are wanted here.”

John Gaston: “I have really enjoyed the fraternity parties, and the upperclassmen have been nice so far, but I don't
know what to expect after Rush Week.”

Elliott McElroy: “I like having no classes during Rush Week.”

Rush Week ‘58 is now behind us. Its effectiveness is measured by each fraternity in a different way, but the
friendships fostered during this hectic time will last through many a Rush Week to come.
