A LOYAL ALUMNUS.
One of Davidson's old students, W. F. Milburn, of Chattanooga, Tenn., of the class of '10, has chosen to show
his loyalty to the college in a way which is very much appreciated by The Davidsonian. When approached on the
subject of how to best help the paper, he very generously offered to donate an Addressograph, and this has just
been installed in The Davidsonian office. This will practically ensure every subscriber getting the paper every week, and they can
be addressed much more quickly than formerly. This machine has no limit as to the number which it will handle
and it is expected that within a short time the college will also use it for addressing the Bulletins. Mr.
Milburn is now traveling for the Addressograph Company, and although one of the youngest of their many salesmen, he was
among the first five in the number of machines sold this last year. While at Davidson, Mr. Milburn was business
manager of the Annual in his Senior year and in various other lines he secured much of the training which
he is using today.
