**Just Peace is not exactly just peace**

**ROSS WHITE Guest Writer**

In light of some comments I’ve recently seen and heard, I would like to clarify the mission statement of Just Peace. Just Peace is primarily a dialogue and advocacy-based group that aims to provide an open forum for students, faculty, staff, and community members to discuss local, national, and global issues related to peace and social justice. While we are unified by our commitment to finding ways to strive for peace and a more equitable society, we do not all espouse identical visions for how to achieve those goals. Just Peace strives to allow people of differing views to participate in discussion as we move toward a better understanding of today’s issues.

A recent remark on the Free Speech Board states that “Just Peace is a biased, liberal group.” I challenge that notion. Since when has peace or social justice been an exclusively liberal cause? Casual observers may reach this short-sighted conclusion given our recent display of the Eyes Wide Open and Cost of War exhibits, but to write our efforts off as an inherently liberal cry against the War in Iraq misses the point. The point of the exhibit was not to say that the Iraq War was a waste of money or that fallen servicemen and women died for a wrong cause. In fact, the exhibit seeks to remember first and foremost the lives lost in the war, independent of the cause or circumstance. The exhibit also reminds us all of the great sacrifices that every American has, in one form or another, made since we invaded Iraq. Whether the war was justified or addressed a serious national security threat, its course has undoubtedly impacted each of us.

We as Davidson students deserve honest and reflective discussions about how each of us is affected by the events of our time: the Iraq War, the economy, the presidential race, racism, GLBTQ issues, etc. The Free Speech Board (created by Just Peace in the fall of 2007) strives for just this—an opportunity for individuals to have an open dialogue about how we are shaped by the world around us and what we can do to create a better, more understanding community. While we may get a chuckle out of random comments such as, “I’m a helicopter,” this detracts from the reality of the important discussions that we must have. I ask that we all try to be respectful of the topics of discourse, the efforts made to create such a forum, and the disparate views of each other. Only when we can have these meaningful dialogues can we begin to address the greatest questions facing our generation. Never has this been as important as our country faces the possibility of significant change in the policies that our leaders choose to discuss and the paths they forge. Means of pursuing peace and social justice are as varying as the opinions of those who debate them; there is no right answer. Therefore, we must keep the dialogues open.

In conclusion, I would like to extend an open invitation to anyone who is interested in attending a Just Peace meeting (Wednesdays at 4:30 in the Union), helping to generate topics for the Free Speech Board, or simply getting involved in these meaningful discussions that we attempt to facilitate.

**Tech’s role in an Obama administration?**

**ANJAN MUKHERJEE Perspectives Editor**

President-elect Barack Obama is regarded as a transforming figure in American politics for several reasons, one of them being his ability to bring an interest in politics to the current generation of young people. This group, in which we students are certainly included, is the future of the country, and he has correctly recognized that. The most innovative way Obama has brought out this interest among the younger people is through the use of technology. Throughout his presidential campaign, Obama and his campaign staff used cell phone text messaging, email, internet viral videos, and the like in order to reach out to a broader range of people than any recent politician. By texting once to 622-52 (or, “O-B-A-M-A”), supporters signed up to receive updates on the candidates and campaign events, as well as opportunities to help out with the campaign. Although certainly not as mainstream a medium as television, print, or radio, the use of text messages via cell phones provided instant information for those who wished to keep up with the candidate’s campaign.

Just like Franklin Delano Roosevelt was considered an innovator for his weekly fireside chats, Barack Obama, too, must regularly communicate in new, more accessible ways. One great example is the text message sent out the morning of Saturday, August 23; this message, sent out shortly after 3 a.m. EST, named Sen. Joe Biden (D-DE) as Obama’s running mate. Sure, this information was dispersed to the news media immediately. But most people who are awake at 3 a.m. aren’t watching CNN, or listening to news radio; they do, most likely, have their cell phones nearby. Continually, the Obama campaign sent out general messages, urging supporters to help volunteer, canvass, and make phone calls. Based on one’s geographic location, these texts would also alert people about upcoming Obama events, such as rallies and town hall meetings. This level of transparency has not been seen in modern political history and certainly not through a medium like the Internet.

Barack Obama’s campaign also made use of the Internet in ways that no other candidate had done before. Obama had a MySpace page, a Facebook account, as well as his own account on the ever-popular YouTube. On MySpace and Facebook alone, he managed to reach out to several million people who regularly use these networking sites. His YouTube account, barackobamadotcom, was probably the most accessible one of all. On YouTube, Obama’s campaign loaded videos of all kinds. Some had Obama at rallies or speeches, some were interviews with undecided voters, some were clips of campaign offices in various cities, and still others were videos of celebrities encouraging people to get out.the vote as well as vote themselves. These videos were accessible to anyone with an Internet connection, be it in the office, at home, or on a handheld device. Obama needs to keep using the Internet to communicate with as many people as possible, both here and abroad. Needless to say, Obama’s campaign was able to educate voters about their policies and positions in a rather innovative way. The day after he was elected to the highest office, Obama’s team unveiled a new website, www.change.gov. This website is designed to keep people up-to-date about Obama’s transition to the White House, as well as his plan for the coming months. Once again, Obama is using the Internet as a medium to reach out to a wide spectrum of people. Obama has also said that he will place any non-emergency legislation on this website for five days so the American people can weigh in on the issue. This level of transparency has not been seen in modern political history and certainly not through a medium like the Internet. So what does all of this mean? For one thing, it means that the Internet is quickly becoming the medium of choice among younger people, a group that will produce the future leaders of this country. It also means that Barack Obama has figured out the first step to connecting with this generation, one that is technologically savvy and lives in a very fast-paced world. Obama needs to keep using the Internet to communicate with as many people as possible, both here and abroad. He should use YouTube to post videos discussing his proposals for policies in addition to what he does on television and on the radio. He should continue using his website to keep people up to date on the issues that he plans to tackle and how he plans to do so. Just like Franklin Delano Roosevelt was considered an innovator for his weekly fireside chats, Barack Obama, too, must regularly communicate in new, more accessible ways. This must happen for two reasons: to both restore credibility to an executive office that has become overly secretive in the last eight years, as well as create a more direct dialogue between the public and the official that they elected.

Veterans make Election Day a possibility

As an example to both the fledgling democracies and tyrannical autocrats, the U.S. has just completed a transition of power without bloodshed or complete upheaval. The citizens of the United States were not presented with a choice as occurs in certain countries but made a choice. In an election cycle which cost over a billion dollars and which elites claimed everything was at stake, the aftermath was tranquil. It is fitting that after such an earnest show of democracy comes Veteran’s Day, a time when the U.S. thanks her sons and daughters who have served her. Election Day and Veteran’s Day are inextricably linked. How many people, when marking an absentee ballot or entering a voting booth, gave thought to the great privilege they just enjoyed on behalf of the sacrifices of others? Everyone knows the names of Washington, Grant, Sherman, Pershing, Eisenhower, Patton, MacArthur, Westmoreland, Schwarzkopf, and Petraeus. However, no matter how brilliantly these generals drew up battle plans or anticipated attacks, their successes depended on the backs of the common soldier. Whether it was the Continental, the Yankee, the Doughboy, or the GI, those commanders were useless without a formidable force beneath them. Those commanders needed troops who fought not only for the men around them, but also for a country under God, conceived in liberty. 

It is fitting that after such an earnest show of democracy comes Veteran’s Day, a time when the United States thanks her sons and daughters who have served her. They needed men like John Joseph Kelly who sprinted across 100 yards of open ground to single-handedly eliminate an enemy machine gun nest, after which he captured eight enemy soldiers. They needed men like Edward Henry O’Hare who single-handedly held off nine enemy bombers from sinking his aircraft carrier by placing his plane between the two. They needed men like John Ripley who swung girder to girder on a bridge under heavy fire to plant explosives to destroy the bridge. They needed men like the legendary James Bond Stockdale, who spent seven years as a prisoner of war being tortured, all the while continually striking against his captors so to never give any semblance that he would help or cooperate with them. The men above are all Medal of Honor awardees (Kelly, twice). However, those names do not tell the whole story. Their peers singled out these men for extraordinary actions, but for civilians, most of the military is extraordinary. Can you imagine parachuting into France in the dead of night while under fire? Can you imagine storming the cliffs at Omaha Beach? Can you imagine being surrounded by an entire German army and when asked to surrender you say, “Nuts?” Can you imagine pushing through the jungles of Vietnam trying to distinguish between friend and foe while fellow countrymen at home spent their time burning draft cards? Can you imagine freezing in the Tora Bora or sweating in Fallujah to avenge those who had to jump to their deaths after a plane crashed into their office? Can you imagine being 19-years-old and jumping on top of a grenade to save your brothers in arms like Pfc. Ross A. McGinnis? The truth is, most of us cannot. We go to class, laugh with our friends, and gripe about a test, but in the words of Winston Churchill, “We sleep soundly in our beds because rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence on those who would do us harm.”
