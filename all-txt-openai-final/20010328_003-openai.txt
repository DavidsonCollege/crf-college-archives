In 1975, Rohypnol started being manufactured and released throughout Europe and Latin America to treat insomnia and to provide preoperative sedation. At that time, Rohypnol was thought to be not only safe, but also efficacious.

Its popularity and use increased worldwide at an alarming rate, though it was neither marketed nor manufactured in the United States. More recently, Rohypnol has been smuggled into this country and used illicitly.

In the past few years, Rohypnol has been the subject of numerous reports claiming its use in cases of sexual assault and rape. Its fame among criminals is blamed on its low cost, ability to quickly dissolve in a beverage, its fast action, and its odorless, colorless, and tasteless qualities (making it near impossible to detect).

In an assault, the survivor is given a dose of Rohypnol to inhibit his or her ability to ward off attackers.
