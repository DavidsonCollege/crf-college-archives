bus rides with the brightly colored pastboards, most of them perfecting (?) their bridge games. The only complaint heard during the trip was voiced as the buses hove in sight of Davidson once more, when a voice from the back seat moaned pitifully—“Four days of lessons to make up. Ooooh!”

DOWN FRAT COURT
(Continued from Page 2)

two months of hilarious gaiety. Bad news: Brother Ralph Smith received the crushing blow. He not only became engaged to someone else. He is now trying to make a comeback with Stroupe, the droop. Rumor has it that “Lover” Phillips is losing his touch with “Peroxy” De Armon. McConnell finally saw his Salem beauty in daylight—he had to find out sometime, poor boy. In spite of the atmosphere of this weekend, there were some operations worth mentioning. Brothers Owen and Tom Smith went to the dance at Converse. Honeycutt and Shurley gave the girls down at Winthrop a thrill, or vice versa—we haven't gotten any recent communiques. Bill Long hauled out “the little red” and took off for the Queen City Saturday. Goode went home Saturday and built a fire. (Them’s his words, not ours.) Brother Carper hastened to Charlotte. (NOT the Queen City.)

KAPPA ALPHA
After a frenzied two weeks, which saw the Midwinters successful stand and 26 new brothers initiated, life is settling back to normal in Sigma Chapter. Snow was the biggest surprise of the weekend. From the size of his snowballs, brother Schwaemle was nicknamed “ice man.” But activities were not confined to the campus. After another week with “Puritan” Stokes, “Hat” Richardson and “Little Man” Macauley led a safari to Statesville. Completing the usual big four were “Butter” Harris and “Lover” Hardin. Maybe it’s the food down at Thompson's but for some strange reason the usually energetic “suicide table” even looks slightly green around the gills. Brother Scofield has been sporting “a two-tone yo-yo that he didn’t get for Christmas. Brother Sam Erwin has relieved “Sco” of the sports duties on the Davidsonian. Brother Scofield deserves a hand for his fine work.

PI KAPPA ALPHA
After an extended absence from the pages of the Davidsonian, PIKA has quite a report to make on its activities of the past weeks. As did most persons who attended Midwinters, the Pikas enjoyed the occasion to the fullest. Although the end was rather fatiguing, most of the brothers had recovered sufficiently to resume operations this weekend. Brother B. B. Neil hit Charlotte, while Ensign, Anderson, Gibbs, and Lee hit the books. The three Salem Sweethearts Wester, Jackson, and Boyd attended the Valentine dance at Winston and returned praising the Republican party. McNair journeyed to Statesville Saturday, with the usual fanfare.Traveled to while Smoak basketball team. Joy? Dockery Pika is proud to announce the — THE DELUXE ICE CREAM — Is Now Available At STUDENT STORE and the 101.

S. P. E.
Leading the pack in the fast break, Tuesday night was “Toughy” Neill, later seen at the Boar’s Head bemoaning child labor laws. Bringing up the rear was the inimitable C. L., accompanied by the woebegone McLauchlin. Befuddled in-betweeners, seen but not seeing, were the bridge hounds of upper East. Weekend festivities found both of the Lillys’ on the well-beaten trail to Charleston, paralleled in search by Christopher’s jaunt of the fair belles of the Georgia hinterland. The only hint of success was due to the courtesy of the Southern Railroad and Winthrop College.

WILDCAT RIFLEMEN (Continued from Page 3)
Davidson holds a previous win of 3569 to 3519 over The Citadel in a correspondence match fired during the week of February 15. This score is not necessarily representative of the comparative abilities of the two teams, according to Captain Kennedy, the team manager, who pointed out that while shoulder-to-shoulder matches are fired in one day, correspondence matches may be fired over a period of several days.
