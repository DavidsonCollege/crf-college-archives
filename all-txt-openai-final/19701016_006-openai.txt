NEW GROUPS NEED MONEY Demand Surpasses Activity Fund

By BILL ESKRIDGE Staff Writer

The Activities Fund has remained stable and consequently inadequate as requests have become progressively higher each year according to Dean
of Students Richard C. Burts Jr. "When we had $23,000 ten years ago, it was generally adequate for our needs,"
said Burts, "but three years ago, the fund was still $25,000 and was greatly inadequate."

The only organizations which usually receive money are the Quips and Cranks, THE DAVIDSONIAN, the Wildcat Handbook, the Miscellany, the
Artist Series, and the Student Government. This part of the Davidson College budget is generally misunderstood by the student body,
although the activities fee is one of the most important charges exacted by the college from students.

Allocation of money from the Activities Fund is controlled by a committee consisting of Treasurer Robert Currie, Professor of Mathematics
Richard R. Bernard, Union Director C. Shaw Smith, and Burts, the chairman of the committee. According to Burts, the explicit
purpose of the committee is to "seek to place the funds to the best use and to seek the best
judgment it could get."

The committee pursues its job by soliciting student organizations and accepting requests for money submitted by these organizations. "Of course,
the 'askings' always exceeded the amount of money to be granted, but this did not really become a problem until
recent years," said Burts. "Then, we were confronted with major decisions on where the money was to go. It became
a terrific job for the commission to make allocations because of the shortage of money."

Nicholls Housing

By DOUG BROWN Staff Writer

The problems resulting from the change in the housing of dates for homecoming weekend have generally been solved according to
Director of Student Housing, Mrs. Peter Nicholls. Normally rooms for over 600 dates are made available in Belk and Richardson
for homecoming weekend. Mrs. Nicholls estimated this practice has gone on for the last fifteen to twenty years. As a
result of a petition, this practice has been discontinued. Dates will be housed in homes in the local community, and
the Student Housing Office is acting as a clearing house for dates.

"It is difficult to say whether this procedure will be better," Mrs. Nicholls said. "Ordinarily this office, along with the
janitors, would be working quite hard making arrangements," commented Mrs. Nicholls. Students may find that these changes may cause difficulties,
and Mrs. Nicholls felt more responsibility is placed on the students. It is now necessary for students to get out
and find a place for their dates to stay. Mrs. Nicholls has heard no complaints about the new procedure. She
felt it was important to be patient and not to panic.

The housing of dates in town is no financial saving to the college according to Mrs. Nicholls. "The housing of
dates in Belk and Richardson has been a self-supporting thing," she said. Mrs. Nicholls believes students will have to be
more considerate towards the people their dates are staying with.

Denies Problem

There have been complaints that students and their dates often fail to go by the home where she is to
stay until it is time to take her home in the early hours of the morning. Mrs. Nicholls pointed out
that motels cancel rooms if they are not claimed by a designated time. She urges that the same courtesy be
extended to those in the community housing dates.situation eased somewhat last year when the allotment became $31,000, an increase of
$6,000 over the previous years. This year, the situation is even more favorable, since the allocation is for $40,000, which
will be the figure for next year, as well. Unfortunately, the requests for funds this year total $44,000, almost $7,000
more than the committee can allocate. Burts wants to "exercise a tight budget control."

For the reason that the allocation will be the same for two years in a row, Burts explained that the
committee would allocate only $37,300 this year and save the remainder of this year's budget for next year. Thus, there
would be increases of $6,000 for both years from $31,000 to $37,000 this year and from $37,300 to $42,700 next
year.

Another complication this year is the presence of three new requests for funds. These requests are from the campus radio
station, the Black Student Coalition, and the Wildcat Pep Band. Burts expressed confidence that the first two groups would receive
funds, but the third would not because, "The proper monetary support of the pep band is the Athletic Fund since
the band serves the Athletic Department."

Staff Writer

Don M. Wardlaw, professor of homiletics (preaching) at Columbia Theological Seminary in Atlanta, will give a lecture Tuesday at 10
a.m. in the Morrison Room. Wardlaw will speak on "Stained Glass Clown and King," which will deal with some of
