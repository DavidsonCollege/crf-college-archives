Wildcat Trackmen Make Great Records in Meets
Approximately Twelve Men to be Awarded Letters at End of Season

The Wildcats’ 1925 track season came to a close last Saturday with the Wildcats taking third place at the State
Olympic. At least twelve men have earned their letter for merited work on the squad. The team was greatly handicapped
throughout the season by both influenza and the mumps, which put some of the best men out for one meet
and sometimes two. But in spite of all handicaps, Davidson received her share of honors, and in each case presented
a good team against their opponents.

Goodykoontz seems to be the man with the most first places to his credit in the various track events, with
Brand and McConnell running him a close second. The events in which these men starred are the mile run, the
100-yard dash, 880-yard run, 220-yard dash, and the 440-yard dash.

In the javelin throw, Captain Gracey, McComb, and Anderson seemed to be almost equally matched, with “Red” McComb slightly in
the lead. The hurdles and pole vault have all been hotly contested by Anderson, Malloy, and Gracey, with “Red” Anderson
holding a slight lead in this.

Soggs and Gracey have been putting the shot during this season, at which both have made some mighty good distances.
It is hard to find a better high jumper in the state than the wiry man who wears the “D.”
Calhoun has very ably earned his letter. McMillan has been doing the broad jumping for Davidson and he has come
out victor in practically all the meets in which he has been entered. He, too, has creditably won his “D.”

Bohannon is the discus thrower of the squad and in this he is very proficient and has done some fine
work.

Varsity Closes Season Saturday Against Duke
Wake Forest and Duke Last on Wildcat Schedule—Dempster to Pitch

Baseball for the Wildcats comes to an end Friday and Saturday, when the team plays Wake Forest and Duke at
Monroe, respectively. Although the season has been comparatively unsuccessful so far, victories over these two ancient rivals will do much
to help the situation.

John Dempster will probably face the Wildcats in Monroe Saturday. He has carried the burden of the pitching for Duke
throughout the season, gaining for himself the title of one of the two best pitchers in the state. It is
said that the merchants of Monroe have declared a half-holiday so as to enable their employees to attend the game.
They want to make the game an annual affair.

In the V. P. I. game this week, Coach Monk switched Abe Kugler to first, and he came across with
two of Davidson’s seven hits. He and Harry Vance ought to land on a couple of fast ones these last
two games. The two upper classes will remember, two years ago, when Trinity was already claiming the Southern Championship that
they played Davidson at Gastonia.

SPORTOGRAPHS
By Ernest Milton

Saturday afternoon closes the athletic season entirely. The freshmen and the varsity both have games, the Wildkittens meeting Wake Forest
freshmen here, and the Wildcats journeying to Monroe to meet Duke University in the final battle.

This column is sometimes called a “column of bull.” After next week it will be appropriate, more so than just
at present, to call it that, for without any athletic games, it will naturally be bull.

With the exception of the varsity baseball season, as it has been so far, the entire year in athletics has
been rather successful, and can be looked back upon with a certain element of pride. It’s a little too early
to be summarizing. That can be done next week. But in your own mind, just look back over the records
of the football, basketball, wrestling, track, and tennis teams.

Just at present, the tennis team is working away at Chapel Hill in the state meet. The Eastern trip being
so successful, we are naturally expecting the team to go in the state clash. We hope Harry will come through
with first honors as he did last year. We never will forget the whole column that was written in the
Greensboro News about Harry and his comeback in the last match to decide the state championship. They said a few
words about the match in general, and then began to tell about a comeback by Harry that should go down
in Wildcat history as a great demonstration.

Carolina had an easy time in the state track contest, winning it for the fourth time. She seemed to do
it without any trouble, too. Calhoun was perhaps the outstanding man for Davidson that day, since he tied for first
place in the high jump. Goodykoontz must have been stepping.Out to come in second in the 220-yard dash. The Forest
at Davidson. Two more years remain for Calhoun, and in that time we are wondering if he will improve to
the extent that he can beat his brother's record, made in the spring of 1923. Both of them have the
same form, and are hoping that this time he will walk in the footsteps of his brother. The players seemed
to think that Wake Forest had the best team of those that they met, and if that is true, then
it would be a big thing for the yearlings to be victors. Their average as a team has dropped considerably
since they went away on their state trip. Meeting some stronger teams and going before better pitchers rather lowered their
percentage, but even at that they have four regulars hitting .300 or over, and three others over three hundred that
are not regulars. L. Hawkins, of Lowell High School, played a part in that low average, too. The Wildkittens were
able to get only seven safeties off him in nine innings, and he made twelve of them whiff the air.
Hawkins has two more years in high school. If he continues to pitch as he did against Davidson both times,
and improves proportionately, he is going to make some college a good pitcher.

The Wildcats, figured to lose by a big margin, upset the dope-bucket, frocked their opponents decisively, and brought the big
end of a 4-3 score back with them.

Freshmen Make an Even Break With Two Games
Yearling Nine Wins From Lowell—Swamped Saturday by State

The Davidson Fresh trimmed Lowell High last Wednesday by the narrow margin of 6-5. Poole pitched a good game for
the Freshmen, the Lowell boys getting only eight hits. McAulay proved to be Davidson's best hitter, getting three hits out
of five times up, one for three. Hawkins and Bentley showed up well on the opposing team. Box score and

State Game
Saturday afternoon the State Freshmen swamped the Wildkittens 13-3. The Freshman twirlers were decidedly off form and the State men
seemed to hit at will. In the seventh they took three runs from Maulden. Poole was put in but was
unable to pull the team up and after State had run up five more scores Oden was substituted for Poole.
Even then it was a losing fight until the end of the game. McAulay and Arrowood played the best ball
for Davidson while McDowell and Kendall starred for State. Box score and summary:

Lanier of Charlotte High seems to be a pitcher of no mean ability, too. Both Hawkins and Lanier ought to
make good twirlers some day.

CATARRH of nose or throat is made more endurable, sometimes greatly benefited by applying Vicks up nostrils. Also melt some
