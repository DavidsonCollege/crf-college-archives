Akbar, I want to tell you my real feelings. I care for you deeply, I think you're gorgeous. You inspire in me feelings of utmost tenderness. I revel in sensual gratification with you. You are absolutely wonderful. You fill me with the joy of being alive. Being with you is an adventure. I cherish our moments together. What we share is real. We are two souls together.

Continued from page 10

If you smoke, reduce the amount, and you’ve already improved things far more than you would by changing to a “healthier” brand.

One final thought: if you’re planning on having kids, don’t smoke. You’ll have to turn around within the next 15 years and drop a load of money to pay for your children’s doctor bills. Kids of smokers (especially small children) come down with a whole buffet of diseases and ailments resulting from hanging around self-indulgent parents. Women especially should not get into the habit. I’m not even going to touch what smoking does to a forming child. And then there’s the cost factor. If you smoke, you will spend somewhere in the neighborhood of $4,500 in the time here at Davidson if you smoke a pack and a half a day. If you reduce that intake to a pack a day you’re only dropping $2,912. (Pocket change for most of us!) On top of that, there’s all those cigarettes Joe Chewning is always bumming off everybody. I mean, somebody’s gotta pay for them. It gives a whole new meaning to Joe’s Lungs, doesn’t it?!

We can share our dreams. I am glad to be with you.

WHATCHA WRITING, JEFF?
