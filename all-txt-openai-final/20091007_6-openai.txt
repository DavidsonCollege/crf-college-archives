The students of the Davidson College Symphony Orchestra have been busy doing more than just tuning their instruments for their concert tonight. They’ve also been gearing up for their new “Concerts for a Cause” program to collect donations for a charitable organization at each of its four performances.

The idea for “Concerts for a Cause” was born out of orchestra director Tara Villa Chamra’s recognition of student interest in community service. “I knew that many of my students are deeply involved with community service, but have felt that the student orchestra is isolated from other events on campus,” Chamra said. “We wanted a way to connect the two.”

Chamra recalled that a music department marathon concert put on after Hurricane Katrina raised about $8,000 in donations, and she thought something similar could be done for orchestra concerts. Last spring, Chamra sent out an email to her students asking what organizations they would like to support. She received numerous responses and narrowed the list down to Building Tomorrow, Habitat for Humanity, VH1 Save the Music, and the American Stroke Foundation.

The October 7 concert will benefit Hole in the Wall Gang Camps, founded by Paul Newman in 1988 to provide fun camp experiences for children with serious medical conditions. The performance will begin at 7:30 p.m. in Duke Family Performance Hall and feature Dvořák’s Symphony No. 8, Torke’s Ash, and Villa-Lobos’ Choros No. 7.

Violist Amanda Preston ’11 agreed that “Concerts for a Cause” will make the concerts more poignant. “I am particularly proud to raise donations for Davidson’s own chapter of Building Tomorrow, a group that increases awareness about education in Africa and works hard to raise money to build and sponsor a school in Uganda,” Preston said. “I have been very active in the organization during my time at Davidson and cannot wait for more people to join our efforts.”

Chamra and her students are excited to share the “power of music” with the community, and to use its power to benefit others. “Music has always expressed something beyond words,” she said. “It’s organic to humans. In ancient cultures, music was a way of bringing people together not just for entertainment, but also for community. Through music, we can bring people together in support of something very important.”

Preston also believes the connection between music and community is a strong one.

Gluten-free group spreads awareness

The new gluten-free baked goods from the Hippie Kitchen sold in the Union Café have been generating buzz among students this semester, mainly for their prices. Though enticing, goods from the Hippie Kitchen such as $4.50 cupcakes would devastate anyone’s declining balance if purchased habitually. So everyone is asking — who buys gluten-free cupcakes and why?

New food options only comprise the tip of the iceberg of increasing gluten-free action on campus. This year marks the beginning of a gluten-free support group, GSG, founded and led by Jadry Gruen ’12. Gruen, who learned she has Celiac disease during her sophomore year of high school, put an ad in the Crier at the end of last year’s fall semester to see if other gluten-free students could convene and discuss their options.

Doctors recommend gluten-free diets as treatment for a host of disorders but mainly for those with Celiac disease, a disorder that interferes with the small intestine’s ability to absorb nutrients from food. Celiac disease is highly under-diagnosed and, if unrecognized and untreated, can lead to malnutrition, anemia, osteoporosis, lactose intolerance, muscle cramps, fatigue, delayed growth, and defects in the tooth enamel. Consuming gluten-free products is the only effective manner of coping with Celiac disease, but this diet requires a commitment of vast proportions. As wheat, barley, rye, and oats all contain gluten, the diet excludes most breads, cereals, and pasta. Davidson students — forget pizza, quesadillas, granola, ravioli, and beer! Many alcoholic beverages contain gluten, so for those over 21, going gluten-free could put a cramp in your weekend style or require careful discernment at the liquor store.

Gruen admits that her lifestyle change was emotionally difficult at first. “I cried when I first found out,” she said. “Granola was my life!” Although making gluten-free diet choices quickly became second nature, making the transition to a college diet was no simple task. After tiring of salads, Gruen explored other options and learned that Vail Commons can provide students with gluten-free options, but they cost too much to provide for the casual dieter so a doctor’s note is necessary.If you’re willing to pay, following a gluten-free diet can pay off. Doctors recommend the intrinsically healthy meal plan for those suffering from sleep apnea or insomnia as well as athletes. Researchers are currently investigating the positive effects of a gluten-free diet on those suffering from rheumatoid arthritis and autism. No matter the reason, determining where to eat is the next step after deciding to go gluten-free. Brixx in Birkdale Village and Joel’s in Mooresville both offer a variety of gluten-free menu items and those who wish to stock their apartments and dorm rooms with gluten-free snacks can grocery shop at the Home Economist here in Davidson. Though limited gluten-free options exist on campus, Gruen hopes that GSG will help students with Celiac disease and other conditions requiring a gluten-free diet continue to eat right. The support group, with an email list of about 18, meets twice a month and has already served sushi (a naturally gluten-free food) outside Vail Commons and met with a nutritionist. Their next event is a gluten-free lunch tomorrow in Vail Commons. They hope this lunch will raise awareness, bring about an increase in diagnosis of the disease, increase knowledge and lower gluten-free food prices. “In Europe, gluten-free food is covered by your health insurance,” said Gruen. “Awareness here will cause the market to drive down prices.” And, of course, the only thing more delicious than a $4.50 gluten-free cupcake is a $2.50 gluten-free cupcake. For information on GSG, contact Jadry Gruen at jagruen@davidson.edu.

If the “Concerts for a Cause” program is successful, Chamra and her students would love to continue doing it in the future. Chamra hopes that about $1,250 can be raised at each concert. “The ‘Concerts for a Cause’ program may also provide a broader audience for the students,” said Chamra. “It will help people to understand that orchestra is not just about playing Beethoven, it’s about sharing an experience.” The other concert dates, and organizations being supported, are:
- November 19, 2009 — American Stroke Foundation
- February 18, 2010 — VH1 Save the Music
- April 15, 2010 — Building Tomorrow
- May 5, 2010 — Habitat for Humanity

Cook’s Corner: Road Trip Snacks
ELLEN VISER
Staff Writer

No matter where you’re headed for fall break, these delicious and car-friendly snacks will make the drive more enjoyable and cut down on time-consuming pit stops.

**White Bean Spread**
This nutritious recipe is from one of my favorite cookbooks, Claire’s Italian Feast, and is delicious on crackers, fresh veggies, or even in a sandwich.
- 1 can navy beans, drained
- 2 strips bacon, cooked and chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 3 tbsp parsley, chopped
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- Juice of 1 lemon
- Salt and pepper

Combine all ingredients in a blender or food processor and blend until smooth, about 45 seconds. Store in refrigerator for up to 4 days.

**Puppy Chow**
For a more indulgent road trip snack, mix up this classic southern treat. I’ve added nuts and pretzels to the mix, but you can use any combination of dry snacks that you like for the base.
- ½ cup (half stick) butter
- 12 oz bag of chocolate chips
- ½ cup smooth peanut butter
- 6 cups Chex cereal
- 1 ½ cups mini pretzels
- 1 cup peanuts
- 1 cup powdered sugar

Melt the butter, chocolate chips, and peanut butter in a bowl and stir until smooth. Don’t overheat the chocolate, or it will get grainy. Put cereal, pretzels, and peanuts in a large bowl and pour chocolate mixture on top. Using your hands (so the cereal doesn’t break), mix until each piece is well coated. Liberally sprinkle with powdered sugar until covered.
