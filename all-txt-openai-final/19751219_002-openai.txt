**Precinct divides, leaves town force**  
By SCOTT REID AND BRAD SWALWELL  
Senior News Editors

The Davidson College Security Department, known as Precinct Two, is no longer under the supervision of the Davidson Chief of Police. The Davidson Town Commissioners approved a change about a month ago which gives Precinct Two equal status with Precinct One. Town Police Commissioner and Director of the college’s Physical Plant Department Grover C. Meetze reported that the change was made in order to smooth out the operation of Precinct Two.

“This change will allow Captain Jackie Hughes to have better control of his own men at Precinct Two. In any organization, you have personnel problems when you have a diluted chain of authority,” said Meetze. “There were some personnel problems under the old set-up, but I am confident that the new chain of authority will clear up those problems,” he added.

Hughes commented on the separation of the two precincts. “I guess there were some problems with the old system. I didn’t think there was much conflict, but apparently there was.”

Under the system used prior to this month, then-Lieutenant Hughes reported to both (See HUGHES, page 4)

**Renovation discussed**

Plans for an extensive renovation of the Martin Science building are in the final stages. The Office of Development has decided to go ahead with renovation at this time, rather than wait for funds to build new facilities, due to pressing needs for an upgraded building. Dr. Craven Williams, Vice President for Development, noted that his office recognizes the need for new facilities. The funds have not yet become available. “A few years ago, we pursued a remote potential opportunity, but this option proved to be impossible.” This opportunity would have given the school funds for new Chemistry facilities.

Because of the lack of complete funds, the Office of Development opted for renovation of existing facilities. Plans for renovation should be finalized soon. Williams

In the campus-wide elections Tuesday, students overwhelmingly elected Bo Baskin to the position of SGA President. Baskin received 704 of the 858 votes cast. “I appreciate the support and hope I can do a commensurate job in the Senate,” said Baskin.

Baskin’s campaign resulted in his receiving 82.4 percent of the votes. This margin of victory is one of the largest in the history of an SGA election. “82.4...that’s about a B-,” said Baskin jokingly. “I feel good about winning by a big margin. I feel it is a vote of confidence but it is also a big responsibility.”

Baskin believes that his ...Mac (Continued from page 1) who received his tenure notification along with Associate Professor of Economics Cora Nelson and Associate Professor of History William Brown Patterson Jr., was not told of his evaluation. Kemp knew of her evaluation, but not how it progressed. College President Samuel R. Spencer Jr. said that “each year the department chairman is asked to evaluate the people in his department. That is passed onto the academic vice-president, who also makes his evaluation. Student evaluations on SIR forms are also taken into consideration. There is a review every spring which comes up in connection with promotion and salary changes.” The department chairman would talk with the professor, as would the academic vice-president. Spencer, following an outline proposed by ex-Vice President for Academic Affairs John M. Bevan, is “working on a more systematized and formalized set of procedures which spell out the criteria more specifically.” “I think,” said Spencer, “that the tenure system is the only system I’ve seen proposed that protects the basic academic freedom of a teacher. Therefore I think you have to have an evaluation system that is tough-minded and willing to make rough decisions at times.”

College plans to renovate the chemistry facilities now rather than wait for funds. Leon Venable noted that “We have asked Director of Physical Plant, Grover C. Meetze Jr., and Professor of Chemistry, Dr. J.N. Burnette, to update and finalize the planning group for the renovation of the building. So the book should be ready soon. The proposal will then be presented to various corporations and foundations in an attempt to acquire the necessary funds by the summer. If monies are forthcoming, renovation should begin during the summer months. In discussing the proposal, Williams commented that ‘this is the ideal plan as we see it now.’”

Baskin corrals tremendous vote in campus elections. Victory is partially a result of voters recognizing his experience with the Senate. “By virtue of my being on the Senate for the last year and the issues that the Senate has handled during this time, I was probably better known than my opponent. It also helped that I am a hall counselor,” said Baskin. Baskin accepts his new position with the hope that he can make the Senate a more important organization. “I believe the Senate should play a wide role on the Davidson College campus. It is fine to be concerned with little specifics like the laundry, the eating facilities, or the housing. But also important is the Student Bill of Rights and the relationships of students to trustees,” said Baskin. “I expect to be working closely with the college budget, and finding an Academic Vice President who is responsive to student needs; these things are important,” said Baskin. Baskin respects the accomplishments of the person he replaces as president, John Munce. “If Munce had it to do over again he would do it differently. But anyone in his position would say that. I believe that there is a little more excitement, a little more activity, and a little more being done now than when Munce took over. I see opportunities to further these good trends,” said Baskin. Baskin sees a responsibility for the Senate to redefine and make clear the relationships it has with other campus organizations. (See BASKIN, page 4)
