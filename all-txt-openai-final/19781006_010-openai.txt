### The Davidsonian

#### Cats split games

Few Davidson teams challenge other schools who are loaded with scholarship players, some coming from as far as Poland. But Davidson gave highly-touted Chapel Hill more of a challenge than Carolina was initially prepared for.

Davidson’s women were coming back from a victory against Pfeiffer College last Friday. It was a well-played challenge in which Davidson aimed to redeem itself after an unfortunate loss to Pfeiffer last season. The game began quickly with an offensive rush and score by Lisa Ballantyne. A second goal came from co-captain Kirk Cameron. This, however, left the team with a 2-2 tie as the clock ticked quickly through the second half.

Then with 90 seconds remaining, Ballantyne put in the deciding goal—her second of the game—to make it 3-2.

When that final whistle blew there was a real sense of pride beaming through all the players and coaches. Comments like “We came back,” “It’s something you have to learn to do,” and “It feels great!” were reflective of the joy in winning such a close game.

Such was the optimism with which the Wildcats entered the game on Tuesday against Chapel Hill. For two-thirds of the game, it was a true exhibition of beautifully executed hockey.

Judging from comments on the Carolina bench, Davidson’s improvement had been noted—and the Tar Heels knew they were in for a greater challenge from Davidson than anticipated.

A lot of excitement is pent-up for a game against a team like Carolina which is ranked as number one in the Deep South region.

The fine playing, impressive stick work, and awareness of those scholarship challengers, all began to dwindle part way into the second half.

With that letdown from Davidson, the game turned around and Carolina moved in to score four definitive goals from the left side of the field, before the game ended.

So it was a hockey-filled week at Davidson in which the team is proving its improvement over last season. In each game, a few players have stood out.

In the Pfeiffer game, Barbie Ashley and co-captain Ann Clark both boosted the defense and supported the offense effectively. In the Carolina game, Mary Gray Gilchrist and Lisa Ballantyne exerted themselves all the way through.

Yet during a week such as this, special commendation should go to coaches Susie Roberts and Dee-Dee Mayes, whose pride, confidence and positive encouragement unendingly supports the team’s excitement and unity.

There is more hockey forthcoming this Saturday when they face nationally ranked Wake Forest Deacons at Davidson at 3 pm.

#### Cats stun Keydets

By ROB GILLISON

When the Davidson Wildcats take the field Saturday here against Appalachian, they will be carrying a modest one-game winning streak.

Last Friday the team travelled north to the Virginia Military Institute. In what soccer coach Karl Kremser calls, “the best soccer I’ve seen since I’ve been here at Davidson,” the Cats came out with a 1-0 victory.

Better yet, they won a game that was in several observers’ views, the best they had ever seen VMI play. Better still, that long-awaited patience that comes with experience is seemingly beginning to surface.

The game was dominated by Davidson through most of the first half.

With a controlled passing game, they were able to reel off a series of shots on goal.

But as the game wore on VMI was able to mount a comeback. Kremser wears a smile of satisfaction at the thought. Instead of panicking, falling out of patterns and rushing bad passes, the team held together under pressure and continued to play well.

“This could be the turning point,” muses Kremser. But then he sobers when his thoughts turn to Saturday’s game.

Appalachian is ranked 15th nationally and the coach thinks they are better than that. He draws a graphic analogy, “This is like (the football team) playing Ohio State.”

Oh, well... let’s look at it as just so much more expensive.
