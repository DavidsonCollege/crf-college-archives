**The Mail/Dean Terry Responds to Alumnus**

**Letter To The Editor:**

This is an answer to John Cutchin’s, ‘72, complaint about my actions to quiet the student hecklers behind the Notre
Dame bench since I am the administrator with whom he is upset. (His letter was much longer and a copy
was sent to me.)

I was not upset by the quantity of noise but by the quality; that is what prompted my action. The
behavior behind the bench was, in my judgment, bush league and not up to Davidson standards. It is not the
first time it has happened. At the Furman game, a similar thing happened at the end of the game. That
group of students came to me later and apologized for their behavior. They had, on their own, reflected on the
conduct and concluded it was inappropriate. I take pride in that kind of student and believe they will be alumni
who will support Davidson’s best tradition.

There are some other habits students have gotten into which are not first class. One is yelling b--- s--- when
they don’t like a call. The other is waving their hands behind the basket during the opponent’s foul shot. During
a Carolina game at Chapel Hill when arm waving...

**A Reprint of the Alumnus’s Letter To the Editor:**

With great pride I rejoiced in the sweetest basketball victory Davidson College has experienced in many years, being the victory
over Notre Dame on Tuesday, January 4, in overtime, 54-51. Never have I seen the students more involved in a
game; never have I seen enthusiasm for Davidson basketball at a greater peak than at that game; and the scene
after the game on the basketball court was reminiscent of years gone by. This Davidson team is a team of
which the College can be proud, and a team on the upswing.

However, one thing about the game still bothers me after the celebration was over: the actions of one administration official
towards a group of Davidson College students sitting directly behind the Notre Dame bench. Throughout the game, until this administration
official visited that section of the stands, the students in that section were heckling the Notre Dame bench and, particularly,
“Digger” Phelps, head coach. However, the heckling was good-natured, in the form of mainly telling the coach to sit down,
and yelling loudly during any timeouts. Such yelling and interest in the game is what gives a home team a
home court advantage. It is a well-known fact that the University of North Carolina, during the late days of Frank
McGuire and the early days of Dean Smith, gave the football team of U.N.C. tickets behind the opposing coaches’ bench
at all home games at Chapel Hill. To say the least, the football team would do a resounding job of
creating a definite home court advantage. Such has been exercised at the past games at the Charlotte Coliseum, particularly the
Furman and Massachusetts games. Such occurred at the Notre Dame game, until one certain school administration official came and told
the students in that particular section not to do it any more. This was totally disrespectful of students’ rights and
puts a definite damper on school spirit.

I had several people sitting near me at the game the other night state that they had never seen such
good old-fashioned school spirit as the Davidson College students had that evening. I have brought guests with me to the
Wake Forest and Furman games this year. The reaction of those guests was that they were very proud to see
that Davidson College had the kind of school spirit it did, and it gave them a great feeling to see
such school spirit alive again at Davidson. One of these particular guests was a Wake Forest fan. If administration officials
are going to tell students when to yell and when not to yell, then I suggest the...Here is the cleaned

Following arrangements also be made: (1) Ear plugs be provided free of charge to all referees during a game so
that they will not have to listen to the constant badgering and heckling when bad calls are made, said heckling
occurring by not only students, but also alumni, some of whom are actually louder than the students. (2) Students not
be allowed to sit behind either of the goals at the coliseum, in that when a foul shot is being
attempted by the opposing team, the waving hands of the students will no longer cause a distraction to the poor
fellow standing at the line. (3) Cheerleaders be relegated to status in box seats only. To allow them to sit
at one end of the court or the other must have a terribly detrimental effect upon the opposing team, especially
when the cheerleaders do their job, which is yelling. (4) Cordon off an area directly behind the opposing team’s bench
at the Davidson College gym, in that that particular section has been previously reserved for Davidson College students and the
Davidson College band. Such must put an opposing team under terrible stress to try to talk during a timeout when
Davidson College students are there yelling with cheers or the band is playing.

To say the least, any of the suggestions above are ridiculous; and not to allow students, and to tell them,
not to yell at an opposing coach or an opposing team in effect deprives them of their school spirit and
part of what college basketball is all about. How quickly some school officials forget that there were some coaches in
the late sixties and early seventies from opposing schools that actually looked forward to coming to Davidson, in that Davidson
students particularly loved to yell, so much that the coaches would wave to the students when they came into the
gym. In fact, one such coach, when his team played at Davidson on Valentine's Day one year, was given a
Valentine from the Davidson students. Even so, when he ranted and raved during the game, he got his share of
cat-calls, all being in good nature.

The main purpose of writing this letter is to make a plea to the administration of Davidson College and to
the students of Davidson College. Administration, let the students have their fun at the games, and don’t try to take
away that fun by bothering them during the middle of the game, telling them not to yell, when they are
doing nothing but generating good school spirit to start with. Students, scream your loudest at the games, and keep generating
that home court advantage that means so much. Such is all an endearing part of collegiate athletics.

Bad behavior at games by a few students reflects upon all of us and negates students’ influence on other issues.
At the Trustee meeting last Friday, one Trustee commenting on the behavior behind the Notre Dame bench said, Wildcats vent
their spleen. When the cheerleaders do their job, which is yelling.

That is the kind of coaching I admire. It is the kind of coach we have in Bobby Hussey. He
is recruiting quality students and is requiring their best in basketball, academics, and decorum. He and the players deserve the
same from the fans, the students, and the alumni.

“The Davidson student stinks and doesn’t deserve to be consulted in a presidential search.” That's a sweeping generalization, but it
delivers the message, I hope. School spirit is important. Victories like the one over Notre Dame are great to experience,
but there is no substitute for class and good sportsmanship. It is really up to students to police themselves, but
when they renege on that, they ask others to step in. Enough said, I hope.
