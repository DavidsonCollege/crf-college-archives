**After two-year hiatus, Chambers bells toll once again**
By Russ Tarver

“When I was a freshman, I liked listening to the Chambers bell ringing along with the DCPC bells. It was
the neatest sound ... and then one day, the Chambers bell just stopped,” says senior Anna Gray Anderson. “I’m glad
to be hearing it again.”

She is not the only one happy. Administrative Assistant to President Kuykendall, Denise Howard, explains, “One day we received a
letter from a group of students who wanted to know why the bell had stopped ringing.” This letter spawned action.
Howard says the bell broke and no one bothered to repair it “for two and a half years.” The Davidson
Physical Plant finally made repairs to the bell last week.

Sophomore Trey Gilbert expresses a common student opinion: “It’s nice because professors and students definitely know when class is over,
but it’s really annoying when you’re trying to sleep late during the week.” Junior Chris Mann agrees: “If it rang
every hour on the hour, it would be tolerable, but four times an hour is annoying and unnecessary.”

Despite these minor criticisms, members of the Davidson College community are excited to restart a well-liked and, according to some
students, somewhat necessary tradition.

Bulgaria, Perry finished his career with his final post: as Director of Davidson's Dean Rusk Program.
By Beth Lindsey

Jack Perry, the founder and director of the Dean Rusk program, has officially announced his decision to retire at the
end of this year, ending a decade of service to the international studies programs at Davidson. Scheduled to step down
on July 1, 1995, Perry cites several reasons for his retirement. Turning 65 this March, Perry says this is “a
traditional time to think about retirement.” Having come to Davidson in the summer of 1985, Perry will have worked in
this position for ten years. He strongly feels that the Dean Rusk Program needs “new blood” to encourage new ideas
which are appealing to the ever-changing opinions and interests of Davidson students. Perry says, “In order for the program to
move on to a new plateau, the program benefits from a new director.”

**Why Davidson?**
Ten years ago, Atlanta-area alumni of Davidson started a campaign to raise funds for support of Davidson. At the same
time, a search was begun at the college to improve international programs. Perry was then finishing a five-year teaching job
at The Citadel. Political Science Professor Louis Ortmayer says, “The fund-raising efforts were going exceedingly well, and the amount of
money being raised just seemed to fit the international studies program that we wanted to begin.” Thus, the search for
a director of the program was begun and Perry was asked to fill the position.

What facets of the Dean Rusk program would Perry like to see continue? Between $30,000 and $45,000 in any given
year is given to students for international studies programs. Perry feels strongly about the commitment Davidson has made to establishing
a resource where “individual students...Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

can come, express an interest, and go there.” He would like to see the international program “become even more international”
as it continues to grow. He would also like to see the Student Advisory Committee continue to blossom. SAC is
a student-run organization who meet to discuss projects they wish to engage in concerning international issues including the Toilet Paper
newsletters, Africa Week, and International Jeopardy. Perry says that this is one area in which “students visibly decide the content
of the Dean Rusk Program,” and that is the main focus of the program—an organization for the students.

When asked about challenges facing his successor and the Dean Rusk Program as a whole, Perry first notes the progress
that has been made. He’s very happy to be able to say that about fifty percent of any given class
has participated in a study abroad program. What have been some of the difficulties of his position? Perry cannot help
but look back to the goal which he established with President Kuykendall ten years ago—the ambition “to touch every student
with a vision of the world.” In the context of a very inward-looking country, Perry has continually struggled to touch
every graduate with an increased international awareness. Says Perry, “True awareness includes a changed mindset—in effect, the changing of students’
lives which doesn’t necessitate leaving the country” but does necessitate removing oneself from his or her comfort zone to unexplored
territory. Its success ultimately depends on the commitments of both the college and individual students to international studies. Faced with
this challenge, Perry truly hopes the new director will have some great ideas “that really reach out and touch a
greater number of students.”

Faculty opposed to students on trustee committees

By Meg Wolff

“It’s unfortunate that the faculty won’t support us in this endeavor,” says SGA President Eric Rosenbach. According to Rosenbach, the
Vice-President pro tempore of the faculty, Dr. Robert Manning, opposes an SGA resolution to place students on trustee committees. He
refused to comment. In Rosenbach’s view, Manning, as the “speaking voice” of the faculty, opposes the resolution because “he feels
that the influence of the faculty with the trustees would be diluted if students were to be admitted to the
committees.” The faculty have been allowed to sit on the trustee committees for the last three years. Rosenbach has received
positive feedback from the Dean of the Faculty, Dr. Robert Williams, whom Rosenbach believes supports the resolution and considers it
a student/trustee issue. Rosenbach cites Duke, Wesleyan, and Brown as successful examples of schools where students not only sit on
trustee committees, but also are trustees. Rosenbach’s next step will be to speak in favor of the resolution.
