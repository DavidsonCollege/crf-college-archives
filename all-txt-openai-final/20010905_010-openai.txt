Taking the field with confidence and leaving it with pride, the Davidson Wildcats commanded a 24-7 victory over the visiting Valparaiso Crusaders Saturday. Positioning themselves for another dominating season, the ‘Cats extended their Division-I high 18-game winning streak.

Perhaps the key to the Wildcats’ win on Saturday was their tough, unrelenting defense. The Davidson defense, including nine tackles by junior Ryan Tennis, held its opponents to 73 yards of offense, allowing them no offensive points—Valparaiso’s only score came from a pass intercepted at the Davidson 37-yard line. Compare that to the 328 yards posted by the Wildcats’ offense.

Quarterback Paul Nichols ’03 completed 17 of 30 passes, gaining 189 yards. Equally impressive was the running game, including spectacular performances by Mike Tarver ‘02, Chris Costello ’04, and Randall Hardy ’04. Costello’s third-quarter 45-yard field goal was the longest since 1996, and Hardy received 10 passes for 94 of his 151 yards.

The continuing success of the Davidson football team is especially astonishing in light of the fact that the ‘Cats have undergone three head coaching changes in the past three years. Head coach Mike Toop remarked, “Being able to implement a third system in three years and go out and perform to the level [the team] did speaks volumes.” He praised his players and staff, saying, “Our assistants did a terrific job of calling the offense and defense, and our players executed very well. Our offense played really well, especially with a couple freshmen starting in place of injured starters. And the defense was spectacular.”

Junior tackle Ryan Tennis was named PFL Defensive Player-of-the-Week for his efforts in Saturday’s game. Davidson’s next opponent will be Jacksonville on Saturday, Sept. 8. Winning that game would tie Davidson for the fifth-longest winning streak in Division I-AA history. With the skill and confidence of the football team this year, it will certainly be a hard task for any team to successfully oppose them.

The Davidson women’s volleyball team opened their season by hosting the Hampton Inn/Holiday Classic last weekend at Belk Arena. With wins over Miami and Coastal Carolina, the lady ‘Cats showed promise of winning an unprecedented third straight regular season and the Southern Conference championship.

Hopes run high this year, despite the loss of valuable contributors from last season. Seniors Jen Ortega and Erica Schwartz, along with junior Roberta Quis, will lead the way for the Wildcats. Each was selected for the Southern Conference preseason all-conference team.

Complementing these stars are the hard-hitting Jacqueline Ortega ’02 and Rebecca Teichgraeber ’03, with sophomore standout Latisha Chapman in the middle. A deep bench consisting of Kaitlyn Martin ’03, Nicole Tonelli ’04, and first-year students Meredith Lorenz, Tamara Gallen, Kristen Higbee, and Julia Hueckel provide plenty of options in head coach Tami Darwin’s lineup.

In the weekend tournament, Davidson defeated Miami in the Friday opener, 30-27, 12-30, 30-28, 30-32, and 15-10. Jacqueline Ortega led the team with 19 kills, and Schwartz provided 47 assists. After the back-and-forth match, Coach Darwin remarked, “It was an amazing match. To battle like we did in the first game shows a lot of character. The second game was an eye-opening experience, but the girls regained their confidence so well.”

On Saturday afternoon, American University prevailed 30-28, 27-30, 30-13, and 30-13, but Davidson regained its winning form in the evening.Affair, downing Coastal Carolina in an exciting five-game duel, 30-24, 21-30, 30-28, 17-30, and 15-9. Jacqueline Ortega and Erica Schwartz once again led the way with 16 kills and 55 assists, respectively. Both were named to the all-tournament team. Looking back on the tournament, Coach Darwin remarked, “The number one thing is that we were able to see our strengths and weaknesses and what we need to do to get to the top of the Southern Conference—and that’s our goal.”

The Davidson men’s cross-country team began its 2001 season on a very promising note. Scoring 236 points, the men finished seventh in a field of twelve teams at the Mountaineer Open in Boone on Friday, Aug. 31. The Davidson harriers performed well in an event featuring formidable competitors such as Wake Forest, Florida State, and meet-host Appalachian State. Wake Forest emerged from the race victorious, scoring a dominant 23 points, and Wake’s Garrick Hill claimed the individual championship with a time of 24:50.

Running under excellent conditions, Davidson’s men posted a strong showing in this first meet of the year. Wildcats frontrunner Andrew Schoewe, a junior, covered the 8000-meter course in 26 minutes and 34 seconds, finishing 49th out of a field of 135 runners. Also scoring points for Davidson were sophomore Chris Schmader (26:56, 63rd), junior Jimmy Swansbrough (27:03, 68th), sophomore Dave Bunge (27:07, 70th), and sophomore Greg Scott (27:15, 76th). Freshman Jason Blanford (27:23, 81st) and junior Brad Becken (27:47, 88th) rounded out the top seven for the Wildcats.

Coach Gary Andrew was pleased with his team’s performance. “The guys were focused going into the meet, and they stayed focused during the race,” he said. “This is one of the best, if not the best start we’ve had as a team.” The men’s cross-country team competes next at Winthrop on Saturday, September 15.

The Davidson women’s cross-country team is starting out the Fall 2001 season as a young and hopeful team. With only one senior and three juniors, the team has a strong recruiting class and is looking ahead to the future. This future seems bright indeed. The Lady ‘Cats first race at the Mountaineer Open in Boone, N.C. on August 31 proved the freshmen an invaluable asset to the team. Running in a competitive field, the Wildcats gave an impressive first performance of the season. The team finished eighth overall out of twelve teams on the 5,000-meter course. The first-place finisher on the team was freshman Sally Stanhope with a time of 19:20 and placing 33rd overall. Close behind was classmate Anna Brew (19:26, 40th), and junior Liz Gross (20:14, 60th). Emily Einstein ’04, Brooke Kittinger ’03, and Lindley Swartz ’05 rounded out Davidson’s top six finishers with strong races. The overall average time for the Wildcats on the 5K course was 20:06.60—an impressive start to a promising season.

Under the direction of second-year coach Jen Straub and first-year assistant coach Adam Johnson, the ‘Cats hope to gear up after a successful ’01 track season. With more freshmen than seniors, this task will be formidable. However, tri-captains Gross, Kittinger, and sophomore Laura Puckett remain undaunted. The youth of the team only brings more energy to the program, and any inexperience will likely be overcome by the Conference Championship in Charleston, S.C. on Oct. 27. The Wildcats’ next race is Sept. 15 at the Winthrop Invitational in Rock Hill, S.C.
