**Ice-9, Fred Romance and Revitalize Live Music**

*By FRED BROADWELL ’83*

Last Saturday I was headed down to the ATO House for a Halloween Party, and as I negotiated the mud slides, the sounds of “Ninety-six Tears” (a famous ’60s song) wafted my way. When I got nearer I realized that the music wasn’t coming from the SAE House as I had expected but was being produced by a bunch of Davidson guys called “Ice-9.” This is a healthy sign for Davidsonians who listen to live music. Davidson has spawned few rock bands in the past, but now two bands are flourishing: “Ice-9” and “Fred.” In another vein, Davidson student Frank Bright and recent graduate Lisa Brawley have been appearing at Giorgio’s performing “mellow” music.

Ice-9, appropriately named after the destabilizing element in Kurt Vonnegut’s *Cat’s Cradle*, includes Joe Jaworski on drums, Eric Long on bass and guitar, James Funsten on guitar and bass, Brian Butler on keyboards, bass, and guitar, and Jonathan Glance on vocals and saxophone. The band culls their material from recordings of new wave and old rock-and-roll groups—“stuff that you might hear on the WDAV Flipsides show,” comments Jon Glance—and they have penned two original tunes, “Wattford Junction” and “Waking Up in the Shadows.” At their concert on Saturday, they played songs by The Clash, The Jam, X, Talking Heads, Elvis Presley, Eddie Cochran, and The Strangeloves. The group avoids a “copy” sound because their instrumentation is often different from that of the recordings and this necessitates original arrangements, and sometimes original lyrics. Says Glance, “If I can’t understand the lyrics, then I just mimic the sounds.”

So why do they do it? Eric Long says, “We take the music seriously. I don’t really know why I play it, though—I just love it, I guess.” James Funsten likes the performing aspect: “We get off on performing because of the excitement involved.”

The members of Fred are also motivated by their music. Jim Rumley, the drummer, and Mark Whelan, the guitarist, started the band a year ago. The two juniors realized their mutual interest one day when Jim was drumming on his desktop in Calculus class and Mark, a music major, asked him if he played the drums. Jim did, and as a result of their conversation, Jim and Mark got together to do a bit of guitar-drum jamming. They were later joined by Greg Thompson on bass and Dave Hall on vocals.

The band plays mostly cover versions of songs from bands in the sixties like the Stones and the Who. They have also been experimenting with some original songs which “deal with our Davidson experience in a very general way,” says Greg. Future plans for Fred include a possible tour of Florida bars this summer. Such a tour, Jim comments, “would give me a better idea of what performing would be like as a career.”

Mellowing out a bit further, we come to Frank Bright and Lisa Brawley. They had been “picking and singing together” for a few weeks when they heard that Giorgio’s Restaurant was trying to arrange evening entertainment during the week. George Schnaren, the owner of Giorgio’s, hired them to play on Tuesdays and Wednesdays from 8:30 to 11:00. Frank and Lisa have an informal show which consists of acoustic material from songwriters such as Joni Mitchell, James Taylor, and Neil Young. Frank plays guitar and Lisa carries most of the vocal duties with a voice that Frank says, “leaves you mesmerized.” Frank says that the flavor of the music comes out in their vocal harmonies. “We spend a lot of our practice time working on that,” comments Frank. Frank sees their music as providing “a good way to relax; it’s both entertainment and background music.”
