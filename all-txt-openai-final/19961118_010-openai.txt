**FOR THE SAKE OF ART**

**Reichek and Kardestuncer on display in VAC**

By WILL RAGLAND

Last week the Visual Arts Center opened two new exhibitions in the William H. Van Every, Jr. and Edward M.
Smith Galleries, showcasing the work of Elaine Reichek and Sermin Kardestuncer. This past Thursday evening, a public lecture was given
by Reichek in the Seamans Lecture Auditorium on her exhibition *Elaine Reichek: Guests of a Nation* on display in the
Van Every Gallery. Sermin Kardestuncer’s exhibition is entitled *Sermin Kardestuncer: Consuming Time* and can be found in the Smith Gallery.

Elaine Reichek’s work involves a series on Irish culture, *Elaine Reichek: Guests of a Nation*, in which she uses photographs,
fabrics, knitting, and embroidery to convey different messages through her art. Much of her work focuses on the visual image,
represented by collected photographs and knitted objects. An underlying theme that Reichek emphasizes is the problem of identity and how
identity is portrayed and often created through visual images.

Three of her works in particular involve enlarged photographs of scenes claiming to be accurate representations of the Irish culture:
a touristy scene of men carrying a large boat on their shoulders, a “documentary” photo of the Provisional gunmen, and
a thatched cottage. In each piece, Reichek presents the enlarged photograph and a knitted wool reproduction of it. She reveals
the staged nature of the photographic images and how they develop into icons, in this case of the Irish culture.
We are manipulated by them in that they reinforce our fabrications.

Her approach involving juxtaposition and alteration gives an experience to the viewer that is eye-opening. She gives us escape from
the images and a new way of seeing things. We are free to respond to the images in our own
way.

Elaine Reichek is known for dealing with issues of cultural identity, having placed focus in her art on Jewish Americans,
Native Americans, and South Americans. She is based in New York and has exhibited her work both nationally and internationally.
Her selection on display in the Van Every Gallery was exhibited at the Irish Museum of Modern Art in Dublin.

**Supermodel NIGHTMARES**

**Marilyn Manson leaves stage early; crowd not pleased**

By KEITH GORDON & SCOTT ZANNINI

I am so All-American, I'd sell you suicide/I am totalitarian, I’ve got abortions in my eyes/I hate the hater, I
rape the raper/I am the animal who will not be himself. These words raged forth from Rev. Manson’s mouth furiously
as hundreds of purple (or pink, or green, or even red) haired people moshed, yelled, and jumped only two feet
below the stage, singing along to the “Irresponsible Hate Anthem.” Marilyn and Co., known collectively as the group Marilyn Manson,
played at Charlotte’s Grady Cole Center on November 10. They are currently on tour promoting their latest LP, *Antichrist Superstar*
(presently no. 3 on the Billboard charts), along with selections from their previous two albums, *Smells Like Children* (EP) and
*Portrait of an American Family*. Mr. Manson, decked out in full face-paint, proudly displayed his many tattoos and scars to
the crowd, who were ready to rock after a disappointing opening act (NY Loose). After a variety of songs, including
the MTV favorite “Sweet Dreams,” the concert came to an abrupt end and everyone inside was forced to leave only
45 minutes after the headliners took the stage. According to the latest issue of *Creative Loafing*, someone had precariously thrown
a beer bottle during one of the songs and injured one of the band members. Many fans left the building
bewildered and questioning the early departure of the group (although drugs and alcohol probably contributed to the fans’ loss of
faculties). Obviously, Manson’s set was unexpectedly cut short and many fans were disappointed.

Marilyn Manson, originally from Ft. Lauderdale, began in 1989 as Marilyn Manson and the Spooky Kids. Their current members each
possess the first name of a female pop culture icon and the last name of a serial killer (Marilyn Manson,
Ginger Fish, Madonna Wayne Gacy, Twiggy Ramirez, and Zim Zum). Rev. Manson named himself that way as a statement on
society’s interests and the depravity of individual freedom among the young people today. Since signing on to Nothing Records, Trent
Reznor (of Nine Inch Nails fame) has exclusively produced Manson’s last two albums, and with the departure of member Daisy
Berkowitz, Reznor played lead guitar on three songs on *Antichrist* and designed the music for two others. This association with
Nine Inch Nails has cannonballed Marilyn Manson into the public eye, including appearances on *Donahue* and three videos on MTV.
With lyrics that proclaim, “I am the god of f**k,” and shirts that read “Kill your parents, Kill god, Kill
yourself,” it’s hard to imagine such a group so ingrained in the music scene today. Even with this propaganda and
a recent appointment as a Reverend in the Church of Satan, Mr. Manson admits in the August 1996 issue of
*Spin*, “I don’t necessarily believe in the devil; it’s just that using that word ‘Satan’ is the ultimate act of
rebellion.” And that is what Marilyn Manson builds their music on—the stronghold that the band members feel people lack today.
Their music is about rebellion. As of yet, no plans have been made for after the tour, although rumors persist
of Mr. Manson’s possible suicide in the near future.
