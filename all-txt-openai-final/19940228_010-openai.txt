#### Bavis's top three CDs
By Tom Bavis

Last semester, Rachel Newcomb wrote about ten great albums she would take with her to Morocco. I was pleased that many of her choices were obscure albums by famous people. For example, she put R.E.M. on the list for their 1983 release *Murmur*, instead of one of the better-selling albums from the last five years.

When I take stock of my own CDs, I find that name recognition and quality have no relationship. As a matter of fact, I often feel it is my duty to crusade on behalf of a favorite if I feel it has not gotten the credit it deserves. Here are some underdog albums, by famous people, for which I have preached the word.

**Billy Joel—Songs in the Attic.** This collection of live oldies was released in 1981, ostensibly to fulfill a one-album-a-year contract between 1980's *Glass Houses* and 1982's *The Nylon Curtain*. Ironically, the songs on this album spew more energy and genius than those on any of his other releases. The songs, taken from his highly creative and underrated early '70s period, are clever pop nuggets that could even stand beside his idols, the Beatles. Whereas the original studio versions flop along with by-the-numbers playing, the *Songs in the Attic* versions burn themselves into the disc. For both “Say Goodbye to Hollywood” and “She’s Got a Way,” the *Songs in the Attic* versions were so much better than the originals that they were chosen to represent the songs on Billy’s greatest hits album. “The Ballad of Billy the Kid” rises to the highest level of musicianship, even without the string section of the original. For very good reasons, *Songs in the Attic* was the first Billy Joel album I bought on CD.

**Joni Mitchell—The Hissing of Summer Lawns.** Joni Mitchell, a singer who like Billy Joel peaked in the ‘70s, has made an unfathomable number of strong albums. Many of them gained due recognition when they were new. *The Hissing of Summer Lawns*, though, has traditionally been thrown the cold shoulder by fickle fans. As a follow-up to her enormously successful *Court and Spark*, *The Hissing of Summer Lawns*, like its title, is more complex and lyrically confusing. In retrospect, that is why the album is so superlative. It floats along jazz-laced throughout—in a ‘90s comparison, it sounds like a mix of Sting and the Indigo Girls. Acoustic guitars, pianos, and slide guitars paint a rich, dreamy musical landscape as Joni sings about who-knows-what over the top with extended, intricate melodies. Some of the more sensuous lyrics (for example, “Every picture has its shadow/And it has some source of light/Blindness and...

### What's Missing? Why some bands don't play in Charlotte
By Josh Larned

Charlotte. A blossoming metropolis. A symphony, art museums, sports teams. Colleges and universities abound. A cultural focal point in the Carolina region for young America. Given all of these characteristics, it would seem that Charlotte would be a mecca for musicians. Not exactly.

Ok, so Rush played here on Friday night and we always get our share of Judy Collinses and Garth Brookses. However, it’s not the mega-acts that the Queen City terribly lacks. Rather, it's the performers of today (call it alternative, college music, whatever) that seem to take a detour for other cities.

Personally, I can identify with such musicians much more than I can with Luther Vandross or Randy Travis (no offense to my Whistlin’ Dixie colleague). In my opinion, Nirvana, Smashing Pumpkins, Tribe Called Quest, and Big Head Todd and the Monsters more accurately reflect our generation’s definition of music. However, such acts come around only once in a blue moon and when they do it seems a long time before they are ever willing to come back. Why? Charlotte certainly has a large enough audience for such music. You'd think this city would be more accessible than a...

### Livingston: characters in movies
By Matt Smith

The Davidson College Union hosted world-renowned intentionalist Dr. Paisley Livingston on Monday, February 21. Livingston’s lecture, entitled “Characterization in Film,” consisted mainly of reading the latest draft of a lengthy paper he is preparing for publication.In addition, he would occasionally pause to comment on or clarify a comment he made or an idea he was exploring. Dr. Livingston’s approach to literature and film is widely known as “intentionalism.” Those critics and scholars who subscribe to this approach believe that it is possible to discern an artist’s intentions and motivations behind his or her work. This idea strongly conflicts with the presently more popular notion that it is impossible to truly know what an artist intended in creating his or her work. A scholar in his field, Dr. Livingston gave his lecture at a level which might have left those less familiar with film and film theory somewhat confused. However, he remained after the lecture to answer any questions the audience had. Dr. Livingston has studied at several Ivy League universities as well as the University of Paris. He is currently a professor of literature.

Something has gone terribly wrong and many avid listeners, including myself, are frustrated. Foremost, the problem seems to boil down to the lack of publicity for such music. When groups do come, it seems that not enough people actually know about when and where the performances will actually take place. Take Widespread Panic, for example. This group appears to be pretty popular on Davidson’s campus. However, it seems that few students knew that they were performing at the Ritz last Thursday night. I know of one fellow student who was giving tickets away because of a heavy workload and had a difficult time doing so because others weren’t aware of the show themselves and hadn’t oriented their schedules to go see it. I’m not sure of the attendance at Thursday’s show, but it is simple capitalism that if nobody knows about a show, tickets won’t sell, and the performer(s) will be much more reluctant to return in the future. In a worse scenario, people often do not hear enough of a group’s songs to feel inclined to see them in concert. One can always consult a Creative Loafing or even our own Davidsonian for publicity and information. However, without a doubt, the most important medium for musicians is the radio. Although many alternative acts do receive air time in the Charlotte area, such listening time is highly limited. Charlotte’s big stations (such as the Fox) opt to blast Bachman-Turner Overdrive instead of the Lemonheads because of the dangerous risk of losing their hillbilly audience. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing—I’m sure that there are a lot of BTO fans out there in “Metrolina” (I’m glad I don’t know any of them), but there are lots of radio listeners who feel starved for fresher types of music. Senior Ryan Smith, who was briefly involved with the Alternative Radio Coalition (ARC) in an effort to bring an alternative station to Charlotte, feels that the lack of such an outlet is highly detrimental to the area music scene. “There are plenty of good bands out there, but there’s no way that they’re going to get heard without a radio station,” Smith explains. “When kids hear what they like, they want to go to shows and form their own bands and it all contributes to the music scene. However, without a good radio station, the Charlotte scene is pretty much non-existent.” Smith feels that factionalism within ARC has slowed down the process of bringing a new radio station to the area. Michael Ford, manager for Hometown Records in Cornelius, feels that Charlotte’s deprived music scene is the result of inadequate venues. “The one thing that Charlotte lacks is a venue between 1,000 and 3,000 people that can bring in alternative bands,” Ford says. “We don’t have a venue of that size. Ovens Auditorium is the only venue that fits that description. Many good bands, such as Fishbone in their recent show, do come through Charlotte, but other groups would rather go to Chapel Hill and elsewhere. Such a venue would probably benefit Charlotte the most.” Whether a radio station or better clubs would be Charlotte’s solution remains to be seen. Nevertheless, until something is done, the area will remain a wasteland for what is quickly becoming the nation’s most popular music. In the meantime, I'll keep taking road trips to Chapel Hill to see my favorite groups.
