LITERARY SOCIETIES SCHEDULE.

Debate, Saturday night, March 30: Resolved, That the Government of Great Britain is more democratic than that of the United States.

Eumenean—Affirmative: Smith, Allen, Carwile. Negative: G. M. Robson, Turner, J. B. Woods. Declamations: Sullivan, Boulware.

Philanthropic—Affirmative: H. T. Lilly, A. L. Currie. Negative: Peters, J. M. Dunlap. Declamation: G. D. Sample.

Extemporaneous debate—Affirmative, R. H. Stone; negative, M. A. Siske.

The question debated in the Phi Society last Saturday evening, March 23, was: “Resolved, That the National Constitution should be so amended as to allow uniform marriage and divorce laws.” B. N. Morton and R. E. McClure represented the affirmative side, while K. G. Lilly and R. C. Clontz upheld the negative. The affirmative argued that the present system is a failure, and that federal legislation will be the only remedy. The negative met the affirmative argument by showing that the present system is not as bad as the affirmative pictured, and then proposed a new plan of divorce proctor, rather than legislation. The negative side won the decision.

The question for the extemporaneous debate was as follows: “Resolved, That students should be excused from class without having to be seen by the doctor.” The affirmative was represented by R. H. Spence, and the negative was upheld by T. D. W. Roberts, who won the decision.

W. C. Neel and C. Howell gave orations on the subjects of “Camp Greene” and “General Leonard Wood” respectively.

In the Eumenean Society, the debate last Saturday night was very interesting.
