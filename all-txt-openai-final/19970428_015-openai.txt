THE DAVIDSONIAN ARTS & LIVING

Masters have class

By WESLEY GOLDSBERRY

Apart from the series of outstanding concerts showcased as a part of last week’s Vail Music Residency (“Masters at Davidson”), there were several opportunities for music students to both seek the advice of the resident virtuosos and observe as they assisted others in enhancing their musical skills.

Ten of these forums, known as “master classes,” were held in venues across campus last week.

The term “master class” is not an allusion to the “master” musicians involved. Rather, they are essentially music lessons held open to the public, in which present students may elect to perform for the highly proficient instrumentalist.

Many of these classes lasted for up to three hours, and some of them were attended by many community music students and enthusiasts. Students from as far away as Raleigh made the trip to Love Auditorium to participate in Thursday’s violin masterclass, held by Kerry McDermott, concert soloist and member of the New York Philharmonic.

In addition to the two for violin students, master classes were also held for viola, cello, bass, horn, oboe, clarinet, flute, and bassoon.

The classes served an integral part of the residency, a unique event in Davidson’s history, giving students a chance to meet and interact with some of the instrumentalists.

Most participating students were pleased with the advice, coaching, and encouragement that they received, and were grateful for the extraordinary opportunity.
