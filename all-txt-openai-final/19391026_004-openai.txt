### Sideline Highlights
#### By ANDY DALE

**Cats Back in Action**

After a Saturday of rest, the football lineup this week is of Furman. Coach Gene McEver has sent his charges through scrimmage after scrimmage in an effort to develop a running attack. Drills on pass defense have also featured as the Wildcats bounce back into action against the Purple Hurricane. Furman will present such aces as Pepper Martin and Roten Shetley in a backfield which has already shown much promise, especially with deceptive plays. Beating a favored Georgia team has set Furman up as potential dynamite for Davidson, and their showing against the Army line and Erskine mark them as worthy opponents for the Wildcats. A poor game against the fighting Citadel cadets showed that they are still in the fight and that they can be beaten. Davidson has produced similar teams, teams with heads to knock for much small honor. With two weeks of practice to offset defeats, the Wildcats will be in there all the way against the favored Hurricane Saturday and have the potential power to beat Furman.

**Vols Picked Early**

Last Saturday was a mammoth one in football circles. In the south, while Europe huddled in small groups to talk of enemy bombers and infantry, Americans huddled in small groups to discuss football and enemy passes. It is thanks to this that we are engaged in more peaceable rivalry in this country. But there is still the fact that while newspapers carry long accounts of foreign cities and running action, many readers skip this section to look over the sporting world first. A football upset rocks the world of fandom as much as a bomb rocks the other continent. Last week Knoxville saw one of the greatest games of the season take place in its own backyard. In our estimation, Tennessee won a Bowl bid on that game. The Vols still have tough hurdles to go over in L.S.U. and Kentucky, but the team that beat Alabama last week can beat them both. Vanderbilt and Auburn will be no pushovers, but with Tennessee’s team at its height, the Vols should have no trouble there. Last year Tennessee missed out on the Rose Bowl bid as Duke received the coveted honor, and if the Knoxville boys remain undefeated once more, they appear to be standout candidates for the bid this year, especially after missing it last season. Of course, some northern or eastern team can still remain undefeated and untied and win the honors, but we’re on the well-known limb!

**Hard Luck Man**

Hard luck man of the week is Charlie Watt, sophomore cross-country man, who buckled under the strain of the race at Chapel Hill Saturday. At present, he is laid up at Carolina and will be out of action for the rest of the season, but may we add our best wishes to that of the student body to a man who went all the way.

**Phi Delts and Phi Gams Lead In Interfrat Ball**

Duke Dormitory walked off with the inter-dorm race, finishing the season with six wins against no defeats. West followed in the second spot with five wins against one loss. The third place was captured by Watts. Last week saw the inter-dormitory competition come to a close. The fraternity race has to settle a nip and tuck race between the Phi Gams and Kappa Sigs. At present, the Phi Delts and Phi Gams are holding the upper hand.

**Phi Gams Beat Pikas**

In a game on Monday, the 23rd, the Phi Gams defeated the Pikas by the score of 6-0. The winning score came as the result of a long pass from Shores to Martin. In the other game last Monday, the Phi Kappa Phis turned back a strong Beta team. Spectacular running featured the play of the winners. Murray led his team to the first score as he ran twenty yards for the initial touchdown. Later in the game, the Pi Kappa Phis intercepted a pass and ran forty yards for a touchdown.

**Kappa Sigs Win**

Last Friday, the Kappa Sigs defeated the S.A.E. 18-0. Jim Hogg tossed three touchdown passes to Scott, Means, and Sutton. Also last Friday, the Phi Gams defeated the Pi Kappa Phis 3-0. Neither team was able to score.

**Davidson Sports Wildcats Set For Furman After Two Weeks Practice**

**Soph Star**

Stan Yoder, of Bowling Green, Ohio, has been a standout in Davidson football to date. Big Stan, a sophomore, played great defensive ball and is expected to play an outstanding role Saturday. Stan weighs 200 pounds and is the biggest back.

**Race Tightens In Conference**

Carolina, Clemson, and Duke continued to lead the conference race this week despite the fact that of the three teams only the Tigers engaged a conference foe. Carolina's undefeated Tar Heels topped the list with three conference victories. Flashing a brilliant last-quarter passing attack with Jim Lalanne as the main cog, the Tar Heels came from behind to tie favored Tulane 14 to 14. They travel to Philadelphia to engage the University of Pennsylvania Saturday.

**Clemson Whips S.C.**

Clemson trounced its traditional rival South Carolina by a score of 26 to 0 for its sixth straight win and second loop victory. The Tigers meet Navy in an important inter-sectional battle this week. With George McAfee again leading the way, Duke's Blue Devils bounced back from a 14-13 defeat at the hands of Pitt to swamp Syracuse 33 to 6. The Devils meet Wake Forest in the most important conference game this week. The Deacons overwhelmed Western Maryland in another inter-sectional battle by the score of 66 to 0. N.C. State dropped a 21 to 6 decision to the University of Detroit, and Citadel lost a close one to George Washington 13 to 7. Both of these teams are idle this weekend.

**'Cats Meet Furman**

Davidson’s Wildcats play host to the Purple Whirlwind of Furman Saturday in another important conference tilt. Furman has a perfect record in the loop. Washington & Lee downed West Virginia for the first time in 24 years, Richmond knocked Gettysburg from the unbeaten ranks, and V.M.I. defeated Virginia Tech.SOUTHERN 5 & 10c STORE Charlotte, N. C.

Team Loses To Catawba Beesters Hold Early Lead But Tire To Drop 13-6 Verdict To Indians

Last Thursday at Salisbury, the Catawba Indian team downed Davidson to the tune of 13-6 in the initial game of the season for the “All-Americans.” The contest saw the scoring limited to the first half, as the Wildcat “B” team, after chalking up six points in the first quarter, yielded two touchdowns in the next stanza.

Scores Come Early

The scoring opened early in the first period. The Beesters marched 80 yards downfield on a sustained drive to cross Catawba’s goal line. The drive was culminated when Blackdog Hunter took the ball on a slice off tackle and sprinted 15 yards to score standing up for the Wildcats’ only touchdown. An attempt at conversion by Vanlandingham was wide of the goal posts.

Midway in the second period, the Catawbans, using an aerial attack, passed their way from midfield for their first marker. The touchdown came on a freak play when a Catawba pass bounced from the arms of a Wildcat back into the waiting hands of another Indian, who snatched it and stepped into the end zone. Catawba then converted the extra point on a pass to take the lead.

Catawba Tallies Again

Several minutes later, the “B” team again tallied. The final margin of victory came when a Catawban intercepted a pass from Hunter and twisted 40 yards to score. The attempted kick for the extra point failed. The game ended moments later with the ball resting on the Davidson 5-yard stripe.

Although the Beesters had only two days of coaching behind them, the team as a whole showed promise. B. F. Moore stood out in the forward wall and Vanlandingham showed great defensive ability in backing up the line. Shaw, although hampered by a bad leg, did the plunging; Hunter took care of the passing, and Jackie Simonds did the punting.

M. I. Tech nosed out Virginia on a field goal, and Virginia crushed Centre to complete the conference record.

Shifty Back

Little Tubby Hand, from Lowell, has been an outstanding back for the last three years. Tubby, who is one of the 'Cat’s fastest backs, was largely responsible for last year’s victory over Furman and is expected to be ready Saturday.

Wildcats Scrimmage In Preparation For Furman’s Hurricane McEver Stresses Ground Game As Wildcats Hold Lengthy Drills During Off Week; Pass Defense Also Comes In For Much Attention

U. N.C. Defeats Harriers 15-55

North Carolina’s Southern Conference and Big Five championship cross-country team defeated the Davidson Wildcats 15-55, last Saturday, at Chapel Hill. The Tar Heels were able to bring home eight men before a Davidson man finished. The time was exceptionally slow for the course but the blistering sun cut down on the speed of both teams.

Captain Dick Gammon was the first man to finish for the Wildcats and placed ninth in the race. Dick Watts and West Dorms tied all-intramural team by having three men each on the squad. Duke placed two and Georgia one.

The Wildcats came out of the game with South Carolina's Gamecocks intact except for injuries to Jim Cowan, veteran end, and Elmer Knoeller, sophomore tackle. Knoeller will probably be ready for the game with Furman’s Purple Hurricane, but Cowan's injury is more serious and may keep him out for some time.

After working hard for several weeks, the Wildcat Soccer team beat High Point College last Tuesday afternoon at 4 P.M. on the Freshman field. The results of this game were too late to be included in this week's issue of the Davidsonian.

Led by Tommy Harnsberger, captain and coach, the 'Cats have rounded out a strong aggregation to represent Davidson this fall.
