Headlining events for the week Oct. 31-Nov. 6:

**Around the World**

The Islamic Holy War organization Sunday released American hostage David Jacobsen, who had been held in Beirut for nearly 18 months. Arab diplomats said certain Iranian officials favoring improved relations with the U.S. have been putting pressure on Iran-linked Shiite Moslem militants in Lebanon to free American hostages such as Jacobsen. The official Iranian press agency said former White House national security adviser Robert McFarlane and four other Americans had recently gone on a secret trip to Iran and had been arrested, confined to a hotel room, and expelled from the country.

Secretary of State George Shultz sternly criticized the human rights performance of the Soviet Union and said the Soviets would remain a “backward outcast” of world society until their record improves. Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze then met in Vienna to discuss “how to build on the full agenda discussed in Reykjavik.” The General Assembly of the United Nations overwhelmingly approved a resolution calling for the immediate withdrawal of all Soviet troops from Afghanistan.

State Department officials said the Reagan administration has agreed to offer Honduras new American-built F-5E fighters or Israeli-built Kfir fighters as replacements for Honduras’ aging squadron of warplanes. A Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry official called the U.S. plan a “direct slap in the face to the Contadora peace process.” A legal adviser to Eugene Hasenfus, the American captured by Nicaraguan forces after his supply plane was shot down, said the American Reverend Joseph Lowery may be able to play a part in Hasenfus’ release. Hasenfus distanced himself from remarks he made earlier by saying he did not know whether his co-workers were employed by the C.I.A.

Leftist guerrillas fighting in Guatemala said they would be willing to negotiate a peaceful settlement with the new civilian government, which came into power last January under the leadership of President Marco Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo.

Citing Argentina's “aggressive patrolling” of disputed waters, Great Britain announced it would extend its fishing zone around the Falkland Islands from three to 200 miles. The Argentine government called the British action an encroachment on the sovereignty of Argentina and said it had canceled plans to discharge military conscripts.

Philippines President Corazon Aquino set May 11, 1987 as the date for nationwide elections for the creation of a new national legislature. Aquino said she did not feel threatened by the recent attacks from Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile and expressed confidence that she had the backing of the military. The U.S. Justice Department began investigating the possibility that Enrile has diverted U.S. aid funds to his personal use, but Enrile publicly denied the charges.

The South African government closed an additional 40 black high schools in the Eastern Cape and said the schools would not be reopened until students “prove their willingness to return.” The South African government also said the Soviet airliner that crashed two weeks ago, killing Mozambican President Samora Machel, was equipped with obsolete instruments that could not alert the crew that it was flying close to the ground. Foreign Minister Joaquim Chissano was named the new president of Mozambique.

Jean-Bedel Bokassa, the former emperor of the Central African Republic who was exiled in a 1979 coup, returned to his home country last week and was immediately jailed. Bokassa will go on trial later this month to face charges of murder and embezzlement, among others.

Three Navy warships docked in Qingdao, China.became the first U.S. vessels to visit the People’s Republic of China since the Communists took power. The South Korean government said it would prosecute most of the 1,525 student protesters taken into custody last week for participating in the demonstration against President Chun Doo Hwan and the United States.

Across the Nation — In Tuesday’s nationwide elections, the Democrats picked up a net total of eight Senate seats to regain control by a margin of 55-45. The Democrats also made a net gain of five seats in the House to bring their margin of control to 258-174. However, the Republicans gained a net total of eight governors in the nation’s statehouses. Senator Edward Zorinsky (D. Nebraska) said he might be willing to switch parties if the Republicans offer him legislative breaks for Nebraska.

Government documents showed that former Reagan aide Lyn Nofziger may have violated federal ethics laws when he intervened at the White House on behalf of a military contractor four months after leaving his administration post. The Supreme Court refused to resolve a conflict among Federal appellate courts about how they should deal with efforts by local school boards to dismantle court-ordered desegregation plans. The Court also decided that states may not deny family planning grants to private groups merely because they receive funding from other sources to offer counseling and abortions.

A report released by the Environmental Protection Agency said 38.1 million Americans drink water with harmful levels of lead in it. The Agency said it would consider rules to reduce the level of lead in drinking water by half of what is now considered safe. A study released by the National Center for Health Statistics shows that fewer than half of the women engaging in sexual intercourse for the first time use contraceptives. A confidential report by the Department of Health and Human Services proposes the expansion of Medicare to cover more costs of long, severe illnesses. The Forest Service announced a new $20 million a year plan to crack down on the expanding practice of growing marijuana in the National Forests.

The Air Force ignored a Congressional plea for competition among defense industry manufacturers for new fighter planes and instead announced it would modify 270 existing fighters to defend the continental U.S.

In Business News — Hisham Nazer succeeded Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani as Saudi Arabia’s Oil Minister and immediately called for an urgent meeting of OPEC’s three-member price committee to begin the process of raising the price of oil to at least $18 a barrel. The nation’s trade deficit lowered in September, as the amount by which imports exceeded exports shrank by $760 million to $12.56 billion. Construction spending soared 1.4 percent in September. Auto sales fell 10 percent during the last days of October. Mortgage rates also fell during October. Corporate profits increased slightly in the third quarter because of the weaker dollar and lower mortgage rates, economists said. But overall profits were weak because of heavy foreign competition and the sluggish economy. The National Association of Purchasing Management said economic growth slowed in October because manufacturers, expecting lower year-end inventories, are cutting profits.
