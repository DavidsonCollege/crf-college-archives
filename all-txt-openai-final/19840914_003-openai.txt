**College And Town Install New Dispatch System**

By DAVID VAN PELT

The town of Davidson and the College established a joint dispatch system over the summer, reacting to criticism that the previous system did not provide reliable response to emergency calls. According to Davidson Police Chief Jack Warlick, the new system will consist of town police officers sharing duties with four dispatchers. Warlick said police officers will handle all dispatch calls during office hours from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays. Night hours will be divided into two shifts, 5 p.m. to 12 a.m. and 12 a.m. to 7 a.m. Two new dispatchers will share 12-hour shifts on weekends.

Under the previous system, a man living behind the police station took dispatch calls from 5 p.m. to 8 a.m. every weekday, as well as 24 hours a day on weekends. The SGA petitioned the Trustees last February to improve the system. In particular, an incident in which a student called town police from Harding House and the dispatcher failed to give proper location and information to police officers prompted complaints that the dispatcher was overworked and unfamiliar with campus locations.

The College received a $36,000 grant from the Duke Endowment during the...

**Rising Juniors Caught Without P.E. Credits**

By DAVID VAN PELT

Fifty-seven rising juniors last spring failed to complete the four-course Physical Education requirement needed to enter the junior class this year. They had to complete the necessary P.E. courses over the summer, prove they had fulfilled the requirement, or obtain permission to return to school. The Class of ’86 was the first required to complete all P.E. requirements before its junior year. According to P.E. Director Sterling Martin, no students were denied readmittance this year, though some had to appeal to the Executive Committee to return to school.

Martin said the confusion was due to student negligence. “They’re used to people looking out after them, and they just procrastinated,” he said. Martin pointed out that the College informed the students about the new regulations. “It was spelled out very specifically that P.E. requirements for students must be completed by their junior year or the seventh term,” he said.

Martin said he and Registrar Richard Burts sent letters in late May to students lacking their required P.E. credits, notifying them that they must fulfill their credit requirement by August 1st. Of the 57 students the P.E. Department listed as lacking the requirement, Martin said, six were exempted because they had failed to complete six semesters at Davidson, “and had another term coming to them.” Forty-six of the remaining 51 students completed a college P.E. course over the summer, revealed an error in P.E. Department records, or “gave us information that somehow enabled us to go ahead and clear them,” he said.

Five students did not respond to the College’s notification. Three of these, according to Martin, were students not returning to Davidson for other reasons. One student was certified in life-saving but failed to report it to the P.E. Department. The other students appealed to the Executive Committee at the end of August on the grounds that they had not received the College notification sent out in May. Though this excuse had “very little leg to stand on,” according to Martin, “there was a move to decide in this case on leniency.” Those students will be required to take additional P.E. courses this year.

**Storm Damages Computer Center Over Summer**

By SHANE MEEKS

The Computer Center sustained damage July 4 from two thunderstorms in the Davidson area. According to John Casey, Director of Computer Services, the center’s communications equipment that connects terminals on campus to the center received most of the damage, which resulted from atmospheric conditions, not direct lightning. Casey said 33 Gandalf boxes, which link terminals on campus to the center, needed repair in addition to other equipment at the center. Terminals on Jackson Court were out of service until last Tuesday, Casey said, and the center has fully restored service.

The center will soon expand into the old Post Office building and into the Colvin House, located on Depot Street behind the old Post Office. The expansion was suggested by interim-President Frontis Johnston during the Board of Trustees meeting last spring in response to a need foreseen by Casey and his staff for additional space. Casey speculated that since a third of the student body plus faculty use the Center’s two Prime 750 computers, space was needed for a Personal Computer Service Center, which will be housed in the Colvin House, and for the new terminals of the User Service Center, which will be housed in the old Post Office.

According to Casey, the improvements will offer more terminals, a comprehensive personal computer program, additional teaching facilities, and more office space to centralize and handle the administration of the center and the academic computer traffic. The move serves the Center’s commitment to promoting computer literacy, Casey said. While...Casey expects the move into the Colvin House to be finished in a “matter of days,” but the renovations necessary to modify the old Post Office are still in the planning stages. Peggy Pierotti is working this summer to help improve campus security. “I think students are going to see a big difference in the dispatch system this year, in talking to someone who is right here, who is alert and awake and doesn’t have such long hours that they feel like turning around and going to sleep,” campus security chief Jackie Hughes said. “It’s working good so far.”

According to Hughes, the Communications Department is making a detailed map of campus locations for use by dispatchers, and the Administration and police are setting up guidelines for contacting proper campus officials in emergencies. The new dispatch system will soon be housed in a newly renovated police station. The room behind the police station in which the previous dispatcher lived is currently under renovation and will contain the dispatch system and a lobby.

“We went from a 10 by 10 room to using the whole section of the building for the function of the college office,” Chief Warlick said. He said the renovation will be completed in less than a month. Warlick also foresees the purchase of new radio equipment to update the system, but he does not anticipate receiving budget allotments for this for at least a year. The cost of the new dispatch system is to be shared by the College and town, Warlick said.

Chief Hughes said he distributed stickers listing town emergency numbers during sign-ups for phone service last week. “It doesn’t do any good to call Charlotte (police). They just have to call right back,” he said. He also stressed the importance of students giving dispatchers proper information. “If you just call up the police and say, ‘I need a police officer,’ and then hang up, it’s not much good,” he said.

Davidson's Newest Dormitory

New Dorm To Relieve Housing Shortage
By TED WILSON

“The enrollment is not increasing, it’s just that we don’t have space for everyone who wants it,” Housing Director Bill Bolding said about last spring’s housing shortage. A new dorm was constructed this summer to alleviate shortages, and enough on-campus housing became available to those who wanted it. This year Bolding said there is “a fluctuation in the number of people [who want on-campus housing] and we don't know the number until the lottery in the spring.” The number of juniors and seniors wanting to live on-campus varies each year. Bolding said the new dorm adjacent to Irwin and Knox “helps a little.” The name of the new dorm has not been decided yet. The College is “looking to house 90 percent of the student body but now provides rooms for 84 percent,” Bolding said.

The new co-ed dorm, which houses sophomores and transfer students, allowed Davidson “to take care of everyone on our waiting list,” Bolding said. One half of the residents on one hall have singles. There is extra space mainly because some students had already signed leases for off-campus housing last spring and removed themselves from the waiting list. Fred Higgins, a sophomore living off-campus, faced the same problem. “I put down a deposit before leaving school last year. Some people who moved on-campus this fall forfeited their deposits [on their off-campus rooms]. Under the circumstances, I made the right decision last spring because I didn’t know there was going to be a new dorm. I’m not bitter [that there are people with singles on-campus]. You just have to deal with being off-campus now.”

The construction of the new dorm over the summer left many students wondering where they would be living in the fall as the completion date became more uncertain. Sophomore Kim Powell said, “I didn’t know until I arrived that I'd be living in the new dorm.” Like many other students on last spring's waiting list, Powell called the housing office several times about the dorm’s progress. “They told us a week before arriving that they had tentatively scheduled us a room, but we didn’t know for sure until coming to school,” she said. Sophomore Emily Bond said, “We knew we were going to have a room three weeks prior to school’s opening but we didn’t know if we'd get in [the new dorm] right away. We thought we may have had temporary housing for a while.”

There have been minor inconveniences with the new dorm. Residents like transfer student Pauline Rhodes found it hard to move in because “we got the furniture in bits at a time.” Kim Powell found it amusing when “we were all sitting around having a conversation and a man was standing there scraping the windows.” There are currently five freshmen triples. Bolding said many of them didn’t want to be split up even when extra rooms were available. There are more triples on campus this year than last, but Bolding said “many juniors and seniors opt for triples because it's more economical.”
