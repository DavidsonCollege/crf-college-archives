If you wandered past the track last Saturday and wondered whether the scantily clad people running in circles were your imagination or not... rest assured. They weren’t. Their performances, however, were otherworldly.

The men’s track team protected their home turf last Saturday as they defeated all eight invited teams in dual competition during the Irwin Belk Invitational. Led by the outstanding performances of the mid-distance runners, the Wildcats let everyone know exactly whose territory they were on.

“Running at Davidson, in front of your friends and family is always something special, and I know it motivates me to perform at the highest level,” said junior co-captain Greg Schernecke.

The men earned first and second places in both the 800-meter and 1500-meter runs. Senior co-captain Dan Gibson continued his impressive season as he ran away with the 1500-meter, winning the event in 3:53.94 and just missing his own meet record. Junior Jimmy Swansbrough was the next competitor across the line with a time of 4:10.02.

Sophomore Greg Scott and junior Jay Jahnes went nearly stride for stride in the last hundred meters of the 800-meter. Scott won the event in 1:57.98, closely followed by Jahnes with a time of 1:58.68.

In the longer distances, Chris Schmader was Davidson’s top finisher in the 3000-meter, earning third with a time of 9:12.53. Right behind him were teammates Brad Becken and Dave Bunge, who finished in 9:15.74 and 9:16.27, respectively.

In the sprinting events, the Wildcats showed an amazing versatility as many athletes doubled in both running and field/hurdle events. Junior co-captain Greg Schernecke had the fastest Davidson time in the 100-meter (11.44). He also competed in the 400-meter hurdles, placing second with a time of 56.19.

Freshman John Leverett competed in both the 200m and the long jump, placing fifth in the 200-meter with a time of 23.54 and second in the long jump with a distance of 6.15m. He was the top Wildcat finisher in both.

A cool and breezy March Saturday welcomed fast times for the women’s track and field team this past weekend. The women competed at home in the third annual Irwin Belk Invitational, and the day ended with impressive Wildcat results.

Seven other schools from North Carolina competed in the meet, though Wofford College was the only fellow Southern Conference competitor for the Cats. The Wildcat mid-distance and distance corps held its own against their challengers, while individuals stepped up to garner key points in the field events as well.

Sophomore Laura Puckett was the only ’Cat to take home a first place finish. Puckett strutted to victory in the 3000-meter run, and her time of 10:40.74 was some 16 seconds faster than the next finisher. Supporting Puckett in her valiant effort were sophomore Emily Einstein and senior Caroline Little, who placed fourth (11:10.61) and fifth (11:12.51), respectively.Anna Brew nearly took gold in the 1500-meter run but settled for second in a time of 5:00.07. The trio of junior Liz Gross, and freshmen Lindley Swartz and Sarah Baxter tailed close behind in fourth (5:08.72), fifth (5:12.02), and sixth (5:18.56). Brew also led her team in the 800-meter run, finishing fifth in 2:28.55 and followed again by Gross (2:29.08) and Swartz (2:35.41). Kim Pierre battled through the shot put and discus events and chalked up two hard-earned third-place finishes for the Cats. Other notable field event performances came from sophomores Amanda Yeck in the high and long jumps, and McKensy Gruelle, who made her debut as a javelin thrower. Yeck took home third place in the high jump and Gruelle also finished third in the javelin. In the sprints, junior Jenny DiCosmo bolted from the blocks to place sixth in the 100-meter dash in 13.76. In the 400-meter dash, sophomore Kate Wilson led teammates Clarissa Carr and Jana Yee in her sixth-place 1:04.42. Freshman Carr was eighth in 1:04.72 and junior Yee placed ninth in 1:05.25, respectively. The Wildcat women felt happy with the day’s performances. Puckett said, “I think we’re starting to come together. The more races we get behind us, the more comfortable we feel. I think that confidence helps us improve, and the better we prove ourselves through the season.” When asked about her individual standout performance in the 3000-meter run, Puckett modestly replied, “I’m working on running the 5k at that pace, so it felt really good.” She placed a thoughtful spin in her comments as well. “It felt really nice to have so many people out there supporting us,” Puckett said. “I’m glad I got to share part of my own life with other students.” The Wildcats will travel to Raleigh next weekend to compete in the Raleigh Relays, hosted by North Carolina State University.
