### Counseling System Ensured, Preventative Work Proposed

By AMANDA HALL  
Asst. Sports Editor

Davidson College psychological counseling will continue to operate at the same level on which it is operating this year in 1976-77. The college employs three part-time clinical psychologists, Dr. W. Gatewood Workman, Dr. Amelia Dockery, and Dr. Meredith Hall at present. Their combined counseling time equals that of a full-time counselor. 

Workman will be available to counsel only during winter term next year, leaving one day per week without a counselor on campus. “We will be making adjustments for the fall and spring,” said Dean of Students Will H. Terry, “but we don’t have any definite plans. There will be the fifth day, but whether there will be a third psychologist we don’t know.”

Davidson initiated the counseling program several years ago, according to Terry. “A lot of people felt the need for it, but the biggest pressure for it has been from the SGA. Student government has been so convinced of its importance in the past that they put some money in it,” said Terry. 

Workman counseled along with his regular course load originally, but Hall joined him in 1971. Dockery joined the staff in 1974, bringing the counseling program to the present level. Davidson College finances the entire program now. The counseling has good support among the faculty and generally good support among the administration, according to Terry.

The counselors serve the students basically for crisis intervention but according to Dockery, many students drop in just to say, “I’m okay.” Most students meet with the counselors three or four times. “It’s productive to have well-trained people with whom the students can have confidence when the anxiety level gets too high, or just to assure them that they are okay,” said Terry.

The most prevalent problem among the students is a feeling of isolation and inability to relate to others, according to Dockery. “Even students who aren't in counseling can’t relate,” she said. “I'd like to see our counseling experience in Davidson move into a more touching situation. Relating with a person who is trained or who is a good listener is a very enriching experience,” said Dockery.

Both Terry and Dockery want the counseling program to move into preventive work, education, conferences, and lectures, with less emphasis on crisis intervention. The school needs to use the counselors better to help prevent anxiety and problems from arising and to train and to advise the faculty and hall counselors on how to counsel or advise people, according to Terry. “We need these people who are trained to deal with problems that occur that the faculty doesn’t have the training or confidence to deal with. Sometimes these people can prevent problems from [see DOCKERY, page 3]

### WDAV Cans Watts, Sealy Takes Charge

By DANA BEACH  
Staff Writer

WDAV station engineer Jeff Watts was dismissed late last week. His position has been filled by thirty-year veteran of radio Paul Sealy. FCC regulations require that radio stations maintain a station engineer and in compliance WDAV hired Watts in September.

Jack Golden, WDAV station manager, explained that although Watts initially proved adequate, he later became guilty of negligence of his position. “Jeff was a bit overextended,” said Golden. “He has been responsible for four radio stations at once. Since we are not a commercial station we can’t afford for things to go wrong. That is, in his opinion.”

Last seen on December 1, Watts repeatedly forsook his duties to the station. Golden cited a number of incidents demonstrating the actions that led to Watt’s dismissal. Watts removed a small motor for repair early in the academic year and has yet to return it. A promise to procure a subcarrier receiver necessary in the reception of ABC news has, to Golden’s anguish, never been realized. These incidents, combined with Watt’s truancy at the station, convinced Golden that immediate action was necessary.

“I doubt that I will ever see that motor. In fact, we have ordered a new one. Since I have not been able to look Jeff in the face since December, I have no idea what he has done with it,” said Golden.

Paul Sealy, currently employed by WSOC radio in Charlotte, has agreed to take the post. Golden feels that Sealy has already accomplished a great deal in station improvements. He has replaced faulty tubes in the transmitter and repositioned it in the attic of the Union. “He has been on the stick. He’s already been here more times than Jeff.”had, and he’s only been here two weeks,” said Golden. “The first time he came here he decided that we need to put our transmitter in the attic. This has been most helpful. He is also a good source of equipment for us. He has already located a lot of things we can use,” concluded Golden.

Outside Perspectives

Author blasts porno, prostitution

Author Susan Brownmiller recently spoke at Denison University in Granville, Ohio and claimed that “rape can be eradicated from our culture.” Brownmiller is author of Against Our Will, which is a comprehensive study of rape. Brownmiller claimed that rape could be stopped if “two tenacious institutions, pornography and prostitution,” were eliminated from society. Pornography, said Brownmiller, is anti-female propaganda which depicts “rape as an act of eroticism.” Prostitution gives men the idea that if “the right to a woman’s body can be bought then it can also be taken without payment,” said Brownmiller. Brownmiller also said that reform of rape laws is hindered by male fear of false rape charges.

NCAA challenges Title IX

The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) has filed suit against the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) to challenge HEW regulations issued under Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972. Title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex “under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” The NCAA feels that HEW erred in extending the regulations to college athletics, since there are no intercollegiate athletic programs receiving Federal financial assistance. The NCAA also feels that several of the regulations are unreasonable and arbitrary, including an “illegal quota system for determining equality of opportunity.”

Trustees claim no involvement in Brickels firing

[Continued from page 1]

Eppa Rixey indicated that they felt the trustees of the College unanimously passed a resolution which “strongly reaffirms the commitment of the college to a national level of intercollegiate basketball program.” The trustees put forward five points which they believe must be met if Davidson basketball is to return to its former, nationally competitive level.

First, they believe that “a level of coaching must be provided that is experienced, dedicated, and with demonstrated skill in a winning program.”

Secondly, “the budget (for basketball) must be competitive with similar successful programs elsewhere.”

Thirdly, “the College must associate itself with strong level basketball schools in conference alignment.”

Fourthly, “in order to offer facilities which will support a national level basketball program, the development and planning of a recreational athletic facility (field house) must remain a high priority item in the next capital funds drive.” How high a priority the “recreational athletic facility” holds seems as yet undecided.

Lastly, “The cooperation of the Wildcat Club must be obtained to provide supplementary funds to achieve certain of these objectives.”

The creation of a competitive basketball program will begin with a search for a new coach. At the moment, the College has no one in mind, but has apparently received indications that certain coaches at major institutions may be interested.

Brickels deserved another year as head coach. “Coach Brickels was never given a chance to defend himself,” said Rixey. “I can see the trustees getting anxious,” said Dore. “But I can see improvement too, maybe to around .510 or .520 next year. I thought he deserved another year,” he continued. “At least the recruiting year. I’m very disappointed in our progress as individuals and as a team but we really couldn’t put the blame on the coaching staff.” Rixey indicated that there were “no morale problems” on the team, even as late as the second VMI game on February 28.

In an attempt to initiate the reconstruction of Davidson basketball, the trustees will back the Wildcat Club and back the administration,” said Cartmill. “The decision was not that of the trustees,” he continued, “or of the Wildcat Club.” Chairman of the Trustee Athletic Committee Dr. Hugh D. Verner also maintained that no pressure was put on the administration by either trustees or alumni. He categorically denied any attempt to influence the administration. Brickels was not available to comment, having gone to Florida for a vacation. Basketball centers Tom Dore and Eppa Rixey indicated that they felt the decision to fire Brickels was a result of pressure brought upon the administration by a small group of influential trustees and/or alumni.
