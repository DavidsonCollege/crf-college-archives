**Judicial Committee will hear drug cases**  
Krista TIMEUS  
Staff Writer

Davidson recently changed its drug policy to allow charged students to challenge their punishment in a hearing before the Honor Council. Before the reform, a student accused of illegal drug use had to accept his penalty as outlined in Davidson’s Red Book. “It was what it was,” Ernest Jeffries, Assistant Dean of Student Life, said. “There was no hearing, no appeal.”

Now, a guilty student can choose to either accept the standard sanction, or request a hearing before the Judicial Committee, whose members can then decide on a more, less or equally severe sanction. “In my opinion, the previous drug policy was purely punitive, with no mind whatsoever for the student involved,” Honor Council Defense Advisor Anna Marie Smith ’09 said.

Under the previous policy, sanctioned individuals had to either undergo immediate disciplinary probation or leave the campus for a period of time, depending on the degree of their violation. The new policy allows students accused of drug violations the same type of hearing that the school affords other violators of the Honor Code and Code of Responsibility. At these hearings, they can learn the details of their charges and have “their mitigating circumstances be heard,” Jeffries said. “The previous [drug] policy didn’t really line up with how we handled other violations of the Honor and Responsibility Codes. Now we have aligned it with our philosophy.”

It is also the college’s hope that charged students learn from their mistakes. The goal is not simply to punish, but to make the charged student take responsibility for his actions, and through dialogue, become a better individual. Smith said that the previous form of the policy “lacked the things that I think Davidson represents: helping students learn from their mistakes so that they can become better people.”

To be clear though, illegal use of drugs on campus is strictly prohibited. The penalties the college imposes may still range from probation to indefinite suspension. For example, first-time users of what are referred to as “Schedule VI drugs” (e.g. Marijuana, THC, Hashish, Hash Oil) can, at the very least, face a year-long disciplinary probation period, required participation in a drug abuse treatment program and have a letter sent home. On the other end of the spectrum, the sale, distribution or manufacture of unauthorized drugs leads to an immediate suspension. For details, consult Red Book.

What is different is that now accused individuals “may choose to appear before the Judicial Committee to determine an appropriate sanction. And a student charged but not admitting guilt will appear before the Honor Council,” according to the text of the new policy. The benefit for students is that the Judicial Committee will hear “the extenuating circumstances that might exist in each individual case,” outgoing Honor Council Chair Cary Wright ’09 said. “Basically, the change allows a little more flexibility regarding the process by which drug offenses are dealt with so that every case is treated on an individual basis.”

“Though the change may seem small, it can allow for an accused student to have a hearing and be treated as an individual,” Smith said. Davidson students may feel confident that their cases will be heard fairly and considered according to the principles of Davidson’s Honor Code and overall mission.

This cleaned text maintains the original structure, meaning, and punctuation of the provided OCR text.Part of the broader Davidson Comprehensive Plan, which seeks to “discuss ways to achieve a sustainable environment, efficient transportation, economically viable development, enduring citizen participation, diverse community, vibrant public spaces and fiscal health” for Davidson, according to the town’s planning website, www.ci.davidson.nc.us. Town Planner Lauren Blackburn is the project manager for the Comprehensive Plan. She noted that the purpose of the community forums is to involve the public as much as possible in decisions regarding Davidson’s future. “We're very pleased with the level of interested participants, but we’re always looking to expand the public’s role in the plan with cooperative initiatives,” Blackburn said. Her ideal goal would be to have participation from all 9,100 Davidson residents. This figure includes Davidson College students. “I believe wholeheartedly that Davidson College students have a great deal to contribute,” Blackburn said, specifically commenting that Davidson students may have expertise or are majoring in subjects that are applicable to subjects that the forums address, such as economic development or sustainability. “We know that Davidson College students are very educated—we would love to hear what you have to say,” she said. “We don’t discriminate by age.” Currently, one Davidson student participates in one of the study groups. Besides mentioning the town’s desire to hear Davidson College student input regarding the town’s development, Blackburn also said that many graduates wind up returning to the town to visit or even live, making it more important for students to participate. “Alumni are interested in how the town is developing,” Blackburn said. And the community forums are a chance to “put some thoughts on paper for how you want the town to look in 10 to 20 years.” Along with these community forums, the Town has also set up “study groups,” whose jobs are to focus on a more specific set of issues, including sustainability, economic development, and mobility. Elementary and middle school students have also been included in a “student vision committee.”

Town hires lobbyist

Davidson is taking its case for money to the capital of the United States. The town of Davidson, in conjunction with the town of Cornelius, has hired Steve Dye, Director of Federal Affairs at McAllister & Quinn, LLC, to lobby the federal government for money. Dye will “work to secure funding at the federal level for local projects,” Sara-Lynne Levine, Communications Director for the Town of Davidson, said. The board discussed three priorities for Dye to pursue in Washington during their Jan. 13 meeting, Levine said. According to DavidsonNews.net, an informational website run by and for Davidson residents, the board mandated that Dye pursue funding for a community center, a pedestrian crossing over I-77, and a parking deck in town. The town’s portion of funding for the community center, to be located at the Davidson IB Middle School, is four million dollars, and Dye will pursue federal aid for that portion. The town also wants funding for a pedestrian crossing linking the homes on Lake Norman across I-77 to the rest of the town. The final priority is a parking deck to be located near the town hall. “The three million dollar deck would serve commuter bus riders and downtown shoppers and employees and eventually could provide parking for the planned Commuter Rail station,” according to the Jan. 27 article on DavidsonNews.net. There are also other projects that the town would like to pursue. Levine said that the town would like to install roundabouts at the intersections of Beaty and Griffith Streets and Concord Road and Pine Street, but these projects will not take place for a while because of a lack of requisite money. “They’re going to be on hold for now,” she said. The three projects listed above are the main projects Dye plans to pursue. Davidson and Cornelius have jointly hired Dye for a total of $72,000, DavidsonNews.net reported. Davidson will split the cost with Cornelius, bringing the town’s total cost for Dye to $36,000. The proposed contract, available on DavidsonNews.net, stipulates monthly payments of $3,000 over the course of one year.
