**The Davidsonian Vol. VI**

**TWO COMMENCEMENT SPEAKERS SECURED**

The graduating address will be delivered by Mr. John H. MacCracken, president of Lafayette College, Easton, Pa. He is a highly educated man, having studied at Union Seminary, Lehigh University, Pennsylvania College, and in Germany. So we can expect something unusually good from him. Rev. J. Leyton Mauce, pastor of the First Presbyterian Church at Huntington, W. Va., will preach the Baccalaureate Sermon this commencement. The names of the other speakers will come out later, but you may be assured that they also will be prominent and well worth listening to.

**DR. MARTIN'S CONDITION SHOWS IMPROVEMENT**

The report from Dr. W. J. Martin Tuesday morning stated that although he had a bad night Sunday, he spent an easier day Monday. His condition is not so critical now, and hopes for his speedy recovery are strengthened. President Martin was operated on for appendicitis last Friday at the Stokes-Whitehead Sanatorium at Salisbury. The student body and faculty are sincerely hoping for his early recovery.

**St. Cecilia Dance An Enjoyable Affair**

Good Music and Beautiful Dancing Characterize the Occasion.

Doubtless one of the most beautiful and elaborate dances ever given in Charlotte was that given by the St. Cecilia Club Monday night, March 10, in the City Auditorium. The dance was a huge success from every standpoint and reflects much credit to the St. Cecilia committee in charge of arrangements, headed by N.Y. Pharr. The music furnished by Lajoies’ ten-piece orchestra more than came up to expectations. It varied from divine waltzes to the jazziest of jazz pieces. From the time that the orchestra played “Rose of No Man's Land” to “O Sole Mio” and “Home, Sweet Home,” there were wonderful doings in the heart of Charlotte. Just after the intermission, the second part opened up with the grand march, led by the president of the club, A. M. Inman, with Miss Esther Ashe, of York, S.C., and Mr. J. J. Love, with Miss Crosland, of Bennettsville, S.C. At this time the favors were given out, consisting of red, white, and blue caps, and parasols for the ladies, and Japanese caps and serpentines for the men. The biggest feature of the dance was the spot-light effect waltzes. “After You've Gone,” played in one-step time, "O Sole Mio,” “I'll Say She Does,” and “Mary” proved to be the most popular of the numbers, all of which were encored several times. All through the dance, sandwiches and delicious punch were served, the refreshments being prepared by the ladies of the St. Elizabeth Guild. Neatly arranged dance cards, with the (Continued on page 6)

**Under Fire at Verdun Dr. Lingle’s Subject**

Interesting Lecture on Over-Seas Experiences Enjoyed by Students.

Dr. T. W. Lingle was welcomed back to his own last Saturday night. He looked fine in his overseas “Y” uniform, and we can well believe he gave it all the service it required in his overseas activities. He began his account of his experiences by telling of the trip over with darkness as a prominent feature. After arriving “over there,” he said he thought others would be assigned to the fighting line in preference to him, but it was his fortune to be located near Verdun, with the 13th American Engineers, who operated all the trains in that sector. This meant that he was constantly under fire up to the time of the armistice. Dr. Lingle showed a map of the territory near Verdun on which was a sketch of a railroad built by the French in 52 days in order to continue communications with the fortress. This railway was necessitated by the fact that the Germans commanded by their artillery all other means of approach, including a canal and two railroads. The treaty of Frankfort had stated that no railroads or highways could be built in the Verdun territory without German permission. So, by their first drive in 1914, they took positions threatening all lines of communication to Verdun and, though driven back later by the French, they controlled them with the exception of a third-class military road from Bar-le-Duc. For three months, Dr. Lingle stated, this road stood the terrific test of being traveled by 5,000 motor lorries every 24 hours. When the French built the aforementioned railroad, the camp at which Dr. Lingle was located was a forest camp near Verdun. He traveled about among 24 camps, however. He first started a canteen, then religious work and lectures. One time, he said, a candle was burning a little after dark in the “Y” tent and a Boche saw the light, the result being that Dr. Lingle, who was a couple of hundred yards from it, heard and felt a terrific crash, followed by another. He ran for a nearby ditch and found it already full. However, no casualties resulted, but after that no candles were shown. An outstanding feature of the place was the rain. From October 2 to December 9 there were only four days on which it didn't rain. So with hundreds of horses and thousands of men, the mud stayed about knee-deep all the time. His account of the French meals was interesting. They shake hands all around before and after the officers’ mess, and the meal is often an hour and a half long. Dr. Lingle figured that he actually shook hands 300 times a day. They prolong the process of eating by conversation and do not followthe American “barrage method” in consuming food. He said that as a result not even the women would “cut-in” on a conversation. There were two “Y” barracks, one as a rest room with fires, music, and reading matter; the other, Dr. Lingle’s, was the (Continued on page 6)

DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N. C., MARCH 19, 1919.

Glee Club Reports A Successful Trip
Concerts Given and Receptions Received at Queens and Flora Macdonald.

The Glee Club started out on its initial trip last Wednesday morning, playing at Queens College, in Charlotte, on Wednesday night, and at Flora Macdonald College Thursday night. The concert at Queens College was enjoyed by only a fairly good audience. After the concert, a reception was given to the members of the club and their friends. After an uneventful night, the club left the next morning for Red Springs. Arriving at Red Springs in the morning, the members of the club were placed in various homes of the townspeople and were treated royally. A reception was given by the Senior class during the afternoon and proved to be a very enjoyable occasion. After taking dinner at the college, the second concert of the trip was staged. This concert was the best given by the club this year. Playing in a large auditorium before an audience of six or seven hundred people, the Davidson boys acquitted themselves admirably. “I’ll Say She Does” and “O Susie Behave” seemed to make the biggest chorus hits, while the mandolin and guitar trio were brought back several times. Shields’ solo, “Dear Old Pal of Mine” brought down the house and called for several encores. Those making the trip were: H. B. Brown, C. R. Vance, T. A. Freeman, A. M. Inman, S. M. Gilbert, H. B. Dendy, C. J. Matthews, J. H. McKeithan, A. L. McArn, B. L. Shields, J. W. Phillips, G. D. Sample, T. P. McGeachy, M. A. Tremain, Carl Cathey, J. J. Love.

No. 20

TRACK MEET POSTPONED FOR ONE WEEK

It has been previously announced that the annual Field Day meet, which has always proved a feature of the spring athletic program, would be held on March 22. Owing to the inclemency of the weather and other unforeseen causes, the participants have been unable to get in trim due to lack of practice, so for this reason the meet has been postponed to the following Saturday, March 29. Very few letter men of last year’s team have returned to college this spring, which affords an excellent opportunity for those who have not already distinguished themselves in this line of athletics to show what they can really do. The question of a holiday on that date has been put to the faculty, but on account of the extra work which must be accomplished this spring, their decision is still doubtful. Unless further announcement is made to the contrary, the meet will be held on March 29, and as the management is desirous that as many take part as possible, it is urged that anyone who has any ability at all along this line, whether big or little, slow or fast, be out in order that Varsity material may be selected.

Volunteers Delighted With Guilfordians
Conference was Inspiring, Also Socially a Success.

If you could have been one of the 20 Davidson delegates who went to Guilford on Friday morning, you would have been impressed with the hospitality of the Quakers and also the inspiring speeches of the three-day conference. The Student Volunteer Conference in North Carolina was formally opened Friday night by President W. E. Rondthaler, of Winston-Salem, N. C., of the State Union. Among the speakers who forcefully and effectively presented the Call of Christian Service in Foreign Lands were Dr. J. O. Reavis, of Columbia, S. C., who has made several extensive trips in mission fields, especially in Africa and the East; Mr. H. C. Ostrum, a returned missionary of Tokushima, Japan, and Dr. W. E. Browning, of Montevideo, Uruguay, who is in charge of all educational work of the Protestant churches in Latin America. At the regular business meeting on Saturday afternoon, the new officers of the Union were elected. Among them were: Miss Janie Klutz, N. C. College—State Normal, president; D. W. Roberts, Davidson, vice-president, and Miss Sue Erwin, N. C. College, secretary. On Saturday night, the Y. M. C. A. and Y. W. C. A. of the college gave an informal reception for the delegates. The evening was thoroughly enjoyed by all present. Each one vied with the other to see who could fill their name book with the signatures of those present. In this way, everyone came to know practically all at the reception. The conference was closed on Sunday (Continued on page 6)
