BY UNCLE SAM AS CENSUS
SUPERVISOR.

Dr. J. Moore McConnell, Professor of
History and Economics of Davidson
College, has been appointed supervisor
of the 1920 census in the Ninth Congres-
sional District of North Carolina. He
has opened an office on the first floor of
the Library building, and is now pre-
paring for the census, which will be
taken in January.

Dr. McConnell is especially interest-
ed in the census work, because of its
connection with his study of economics.

There are ten counties in his district,
and there will be two hundred enume-
rators appointed. He has selected Prof.
A. Currie as his chief assistant and Miss
Dorothy Finlayson as his secretary and
stenographer.

Dr. McConnell is a very wise choice,
on account of his great interest in the
study of economics, and a better man
for the place would have been hard to
find.

FALL
CLOTHING

Another Fall Is Here

We notice that here and there the leaves
are turning brown---summer is passing away.
But the sure signs of autumn are found inside
our store. The new fall clothing for men is
on the racks. And we are mighty proud of
these new garments. They look good on the
racks. They are going to look still better
when they get where they belong---on the
backs of men. And what’s best of all, we
know the material of which they are made
and that they are tailored as well as clothing
can be tailored. The big surprise is that these
garments are priced unexpectedly low.
