#### Palestinian riots continue; Ortmayer will run for President

By KATHERINE PRICE

Headlining the news January 7-14:

Violence continues in the Israeli-occupied territories, where approximately thirty Palestinians have been killed since December. The Israeli Army has cracked down on the unrest, but political solutions to the problems recently have been suggested. Israeli Prime Minister Shamir insists on retaining Israeli sovereignty over the territories, which Israel has occupied since 1967.

A West German woman, Christina Gabriele Endrigkeit, was arrested on Monday for allegedly planting the bomb in a West Berlin discotheque that led to the U.S. air raid on Libya last April. U.S. officials insist that there was a Libyan connection to the bombing.

Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita will visit Washington this week. Trade issues will be the major focus of discussions between Takeshita and U.S. officials. The U.S. suffers from a severe trade imbalance with Japan, whose imports into the U.S. have raised cries for protection from domestic industries.

The U.S.S.R. has indicated that a withdrawal of its troops from Afghanistan could begin as soon as May 1. The Communist Party newspaper Pravda emphasized that the timetable for withdrawal depended on a significant reduction of U.S. and Pakistani aid for the mujahedin rebel forces in Afghanistan.

In addition, the U.S.S.R. suggested a summit meeting between Soviet leader Gorbachev and Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping. The Chinese have cited the problems of Cambodia as the major obstacle to a Sino-Soviet summit.

In Nicaragua, 10,000 people participated in an anti-government demonstration honoring the tenth anniversary of the death of newspaper publisher Pedro Joaquin Chamorro. Chamorro was a strong critic of Anastasio Somoza.

#### And in Davidson...

In a move that may place our beloved, yet somewhat obscure, Davidson in the national spotlight, Dr. Lou Ortmayer announced his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination. Ortmayer made his announcement at a meeting of the Political Science Senior Colloquium, a required course for Political Science majors. Colloquium students will serve Ortmayer as campaign advisers.

Ortmayer’s campaign platform stresses strong support for the Intermediate Nuclear Forces treaty, as well as for the Arias Central American peace plan. Ortmayer would like to cut the defense budget and reduce the deficit by $30 billion. He supports a national sales tax of 5%, and would like to concentrate on public works and education.

The Democratic campaign, which appeared to have no front-runner until Gary Hart reentered the race, is far from decided. Many observers attribute Hart’s lead to name recognition from his affair with Donna Rice, which led to his earlier withdrawal. While Ortmayer’s attempt to capture the Democratic nomination may be something of a long-shot, stranger things have happened. Of particular importance to the campaign will be candidate performances during the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary.

Campus reaction to Ortmayer’s campaign has been mixed:
- “Ortmayer’s candidacy has my unqualified support.”
- “I hope that he uses his political cartoons to gain an advantage over his campaign opponents.”
- “I want him to ‘fess up about the skeletons in his closet.”
- “Ortmayer’s election to the presidency would, if nothing else, stimulate the cause of feminism, since if he follows his usual patterns, his cabinet will be at least 80% female. Further, the White House tennis courts will be transformed into world-class volleyball courts.”

Those students and/or fans desiring to participate in the campaign are urged to contact Dr. Ortmayer.

#### DORMS, from p. 1

The new housing will replace the perimeter houses, an off-campus housing alternative for seniors. The houses have been slated for renovation and use as administrative offices.

This renovation will not be completed on the same schedule as the three dorms. If for some reason the dorms are not finished by August, the perimeter houses not yet being renovated may be used as temporary housing until the dorms are finished.

When Akers dorm was built in 1984, construction was started after graduation in May and the dorm was ready for occupation by the following September. Although Kuykendall says, “that’s not the way we like to do business,” he plans to do what is necessary to have these new dorms finished.

Meetze is hopeful. “We will work furiously,” he says, “and make every effort to complete the dorms on time.”

#### EISNER, from p. 1

Cornelson Lecturer Robert Eisner emphasized that expenditure cuts are not the right answer. His solution comes with an easy monetary policy. This will reduce interest rates, which will directly decrease the deficit by decreasing future payment on past debt. In addition, it will stimulate investment, increase real GNP, and reduce the dollar’s attractiveness to increase exports.
