Recent Campaigns Were Not Clean

Finally, after three weeks of eight-track grins, computerized balloting, paper posters, an autumn full of fliers under your door, and an Unopened End, the elections are over, at least until next year. As far as my own campaign was concerned, I have no complaints whatsoever. Perhaps more than anyone my opponent is to be thanked for his admirable conduct during the entire campaign. My feelings about some of the other elections, however, are not so satisfactory.

During that first week, I witnessed some of the most childish and disgusting behavior by students since the naughty days of high school. The week of the laurels, one of our former co-editors declared that everyone was to be commended for such a clean campaign. He may have been moved to make this statement because of the outcome, yet even with this slight prejudice, his remark struck me as an abject lie. Fortunately, the elections got rid of him too.

To be specific, I turn my attention to the election for SGA president. Two candidates, diametrically opposed, each backed by his own ideological constituency, sought the office. By Tuesday morning, the campus was polarized by propaganda, and armed with clichés and delusions of moral supremacy, the student body turned out in full wool to vote.

Tuesday evening, two letters to the newspaper arrived in the office of THE DAVIDSONIAN. They were obvious endorsements for Alexander, but there was nothing profane or libelous about their content, which meets the only criteria of the newspaper for accepting a letter. Since anybody with a little journalistic discretion and three years upstairs knows that he should read anything under a “Letters” heading with a measure of doubt, these two items were included in that issue as legitimate student opinion.

Subsequent to this decision, however, one of the co-editors attached a boldfaced little editorial note in which he deplored such letters. His motive for this action was, if anything, more political than that of the letters. Yet the editors decide policy. The other co-editor, however, felt left out of the campaign, so he decided to endorse the other candidate in the top editorial on page 4 that week. This had never been done before. Of course, in the editorial he dissociated himself mildly from the staff, qualifying the uniqueness of his opinion, which was based no doubt on a Pauline vision. This editorial, a precedent, was in direct contradiction to the tone of the editorial note attached to the letters on the next page. On one hand, one editor expressed his contempt for cheap propaganda while the other editor reserved the best space on the editorial page for several inches of biased, political cheesecloth opinion.

Fortunately, the present editor opposed the use of the paper for such an unconscionable purpose, and he has pledged not to revoke such a dangerous precedent in the future. It would seem here that the judgment of all the past editors of THE DAVIDSONIAN and that of the present editor is more competent than the precedent-setting passion of a seminary student.

Leaving the newspaper, there are some other underhanded activities which took place in the dorms. Posters were everywhere, walls, water fountains, and windows which is as it should be. But some did not take them that way. Instead, they took them down, en masse. Second floor Watts serves as a good example. On Sunday night, Alexander supporters went through that dorm slapping up posters and platform sheets. One of the supporters checked by later that night on the hall. From the stairwell, he heard...

“Night of the Iguana” comes to the Little Theatre of Charlotte for seven evening performances Feb. 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, and 12 at 8:30 p.m. and a Sunday matinee Feb. 6 at 2:30. Some consider this psyche-searching drama to be Tennessee Williams' most mature work.

The Charlotte Symphony will play chamber music in Dana Auditorium at Queens on Jan. 30 at 8:15 p.m.

“Company” will be presented in Ovens Auditorium on Feb. 1. Curtain time for this Broadway musical is 8 p.m.

“Museum Without Walls,” a film series of international art works, continues with “Giotto and the Pre-Renaissance Crete and Mycenae” Jan. 30 at 3 p.m.

A book and author luncheon featuring Frank Slaughter, George Garrett, Carolyn Kizer, and Walter Spearman will be held in Morrison Dining Room at Queens College on Feb. 3 at noon. Davidson students may purchase a reservation by calling the Queens library.

Eugene Barban will play Brahms, Barber, Beethoven, and Liapounov in a piano recital in Dana Auditorium at Queens College.At the Mint Museum at 3 p.m. Jan. 30 in the Golden Circle Theatre, special displays at the Mint Museum of Art this week will include sculpture by Thomas Nonn, a UNC-C art professor, in the Dwelle Gallery, and a loan from the Bechtler collection of graphics by modern Swiss sculptors in the Round Gallery.

Something was being ripped from the wall, so he ran through the door to see, not a freshman, but lo and behold, a hall counselor walking away with a poster in his hands. An argument ensued with both of the hall counselors on second Watts, and the following morning one of their names was reported to the office of the dean of students. Will Terry called in this person, a junior at Davidson College, and reprimanded him for such childish conduct. No other punishment was issued. So it goes.

Take another example. Alexander supporters descended on Chambers also Sunday night, putting up 20 thin black posters in odd places throughout the building. There were four left the next morning. The custodian department reported that they had been forced to take down five of them for maintenance reasons. Yet the other 11 posters were torn down, and the rest were gone by that evening.

There were other lamentable incidents. The retiring SGA president, who thinks he is “going places,” also broke precedent to endorse publicly his candidate, another first at Davidson. The Open End was another brawl this year too, a farce to the tune of audience participation. The only consolation was that few people attended anyhow, and most of these had already made up their minds beforehand. Perhaps one way to salvage the purpose of this gathering would be to pick a moderator from the faculty instead of one from the Elections Board. In this manner, one impartial individual could serve as a selective yet objective mediator who might enforce the rule of equal time among the audience as well as the candidates. If this fails, a sergeant-at-arms might be more appropriate.

No, former co-editor, it was not a clean election for SGA president, not to mention the Cooke County senatorial race for rising juniors. It was not all roses, but a sick rose, full of invisible worms. Maybe the Davidson gentleman is now a myth at this campus, but the conduct of a minority of students during the past three weeks would have been offensive to anyone under 30 as well as any child over ten.

### Outside Perspective
By LEX VEAZEY

#### Students To Test “800 Rule”
Two Clemson freshmen will challenge the constitutionality of the Atlantic Coast Conference’s controversial ‘800 rule’ concerning the academic requirement that prospective athletes achieve a combined total of at least 800 on the College Entrance Examination Board. The students, Joey Beach of St. George and James Vickery of Charleston, recently filed a suit requesting a preliminary injunction to prohibit Clemson and the ACC from enforcing the requirement. As of yet, no date has been set for a formal hearing which is to take place in the U.S. District Court in Anderson.

#### NCAA Concerned About Exclusion of Women
According to “The Chronicle of Higher Education,” the National Collegiate Athletic Association recently discovered that in trying to coordinate the nation’s sports, it may have overlooked someone who does not wish to be overlooked—the female. During the past year, Walter Byers, the NCAA’s executive director, learned that women might have a legal case if they claim that the NCAA discriminates against them in its all-male policies.

#### Faculty Council Discusses Department Head Evaluation
In a recent meeting of the Faculty Affairs Committee of Mississippi State University, it was recommended that the department heads be evaluated every four years by full-time faculty members with one year’s service. According to the committee report, a decline in the “influx of fresh ideas” by heads after several years of leadership has made this evaluation necessary. The Faculty Evaluation Committee made a motion that “data collected on each faculty member participating in the faculty evaluation be released to the Student Association for publication purposes, if the Student Association requests these data.” The motion was placed in committee for further study.

#### U.N.C. Okays Limited Drinking for Union
Chancellor Carlyle Sitterson has approved the serving and consumption of beer and wine at specific Student Union functions at UNC. However, the alcoholic content must not be greater than 14 percent, and the consumption of the alcohol must be restricted to persons 18 or over. C. O. Mathey, Dean of Student Affairs, explained that selling of beer on other North Carolina campuses, such as Duke or Davidson, is permitted by state law. State-owned universities, such as UNC, may not apply for an ABC license to sell beer or wine.
