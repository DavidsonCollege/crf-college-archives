ALENDA IRC Discusses Soviet Russia After the War
Bradley, Morton Argue Position of U.S.S.R. in Post-War World

The International Relations Club is planning to resume activities during the second semester. Thursday, March 2, has been set for the first meeting, at 8:15 in the seminar room of the Library. The question under discussion will be, "Is Soviet Russia a menace to the peace of the post-war world?" All men who are interested, whether members of the Club or not, are urged to attend. Some of the arguments which will be more fully discussed are summarized by Bradley and Morton.

T. D. Bradley believes Communist Russia is a danger to the post-war world because strategic and economic considerations force the Soviets to seek the historic objectives of Russian foreign policy: control of Constantinople in the west and Port Arthur in the east. Russia's aims conflict with British and Turkish interests in the Balkans and Chinese interests in the east. Against Russia, these objectives might lead to Russian aggression and threaten peace, but the danger lies in the fact that Russia might not stop there. They might not permit the Allies to establish a communistic sphere of influence and will attempt to communize a broad area which Russia considers the borderland between Capitalism and Communism, including Finland and Sweden in the north, Germany in central Europe, the Danubian states, and Turkey in the south.

BOARD MEETS—At its regular semi-annual meeting Wednesday, February 16, the Board of Trustees decided to dedicate the science building to Col. W. J. Martin, and to allow students to hold social functions on the campus.

Enrollment High

An all-time high of 745 students is training on the Davidson campus. This number includes both civilian students and members of the Air Corps. The smaller enrollment in the civilian student body is due to the calls to military service. Mr. F. H. Hengeveld, registrar, stated that as yet only four applications for deferment at Davidson have been acted on by the commission.

Students and members of the faculty are planning a stunt show to be held Friday from 7:15 to 10 p.m. in Chambers' auditorium. An announcement from the office of President John R. Cunningham has given the speaker list for Sunday night vesper services during the second semester. The speakers, chosen by Dr. Cunningham and the Y Cabinet, have been selected to record my appreciation for the cooperation and service they are rendering.

Marcel R. X. A. Benfield, Jr., Professor in Hebrew and Old Testament, will definitely be the first speaker.Louisville Presbyterian Seminary President recommendation to 1 . . . - .
