‘Friday, October 2, 1987 THE DAVIDSONIAN

THE DEEP ADVENTURES, or We Find Our Hero Bazar and Confused, But Found Himself. However, the Words of His Freshman
Advisor Continue to Haunt Him.

Go out, and become the TRUE DAVIDSON STUDENT.

Unfortunately, Ben wasn't quite sure what the “True Davidson Student” was. Could it be the one with the most computer-generated
T-shirts? They are so plain. Or the one who attended the most parties? Like had the best time Friday night,
if he can remember anything. So it must be the best. Maybe that sine wave watermelon have been great, (News
Berkeley in seed spitting contest with speech and debate team).

Stop submitting to others and start submitting to Inside Art. Drop your stuff by the Davidsonian offices.
