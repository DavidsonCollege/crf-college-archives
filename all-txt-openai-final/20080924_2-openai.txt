2 THE DAVIDSONIAN

### Chi Kelly Beggs, Staff Writer

One Neighborhood, a fair trade store located in Birkdale, hosted speaker and activist Chie Abad Tuesday, Sept. 16th at Summit
Coffee to explain what the price tags do not: the true cost of clothing. Abad’s story illuminates the hidden journey
that a piece of clothing goes through before it sits folded on the shelves of a retail store. Abad says
that “Sweatshop labor is not just an allegation, but actual living and working conditions.”

Abad worked for Sako Corporation, which makes clothes for the Gap and other major US retailers on the Pacific island
of Saipan in the US Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. The labels on the clothes that she made claimed
“made in the USA,” but the wages she received were far below the country’s standard ($3.15 per hour) as were
the working conditions that she endured. These conditions include working over 14 hours a day, seven days a week in
a poorly ventilated factory with no safety equipment. Workers had restricted bathroom and water breaks and lived in squalid barracks
with thirty women squeezed into a room the size of the upstairs of Summit.

Abad, who is originally from the Philippines, paid $2,500 to a recruiting agency to get this job. She and others
were forced to sign a “Shadow Contract” in which a person signs away their basic rights—they relinquish the right to
participate in religious and political activities; they cannot complain about working overtime. In some cases, these contracts prohibit employees from
marrying, and if a woman gets pregnant, she will be fired.

After five years of this “lifestyle,” Abad decided to take action and tried to organize a union, but when the
management discovered her plan, they threatened to shut down the factory. Her coworkers feared losing their jobs, so her attempt
failed. After this event, management refused to renew her employment contract. Abad took her case to the Equal Employment Opportunities
Commission who prohibited Sako from firing her. She left Saipan in 1999 to come to the United States to educate
the American public about the harsh realities of sweatshops. Since then, Abad has advocated the neglected rights of garment workers
in Saipan and around the world.

### Lecture Series Welcomes

Katie Lovett, Staff Writer

The first part of the 2008 Staley Lecture Series, entitled The Melody of Faith: Theology in an Orthodox Key, took
place last Sunday at 7:30 p.m. in the 900 Room. Each year the Staley Lecture Series offers an opportunity for
students and faculty alike to hear distinguished Christian speakers. The topics covered aim to be “both intellectually challenging and spiritually
fulfilling,” stated this year’s speaker Dr. Vigen Guroian, Professor of Eastern Orthodox Christianity at the University of Virginia.

Guroian commented that he enjoyed revisiting Davidson since he considered attending Davidson College before deciding on the University of Virginia.
He received his B.A. from UVA and then went on to earn his Ph.D. from Drew University in New Jersey.
He is the author of over 250 articles and nine books, including “Inheriting Paradise” and “Ethics After Christendom.”

The focal point of Guroian’s lecture was his desire to “enrich the understanding of and ability to communicate” Orthodox theology.
Guroian began “The Melody of Faith” by presenting a late medieval Armenian illuminated manuscript of the Creation and pointing out
that many people are unfamiliar with Orthodox beliefs. However, according to Guroian, “they constitute the second most prominent religion in
the world.”

### Abad Visits Summit, Shares Story

Her advocacy has created positive change—in September 2002, a settlement was reached for a class action lawsuit that investigated the
working conditions of 26 major retailers in Saipan. The $20 million settlement went back to workers to pay for recruitment
fees and unfair wages. Abad avidly encourages students to get involved in advocacy. She recommends that students encourage their universities
to join the Sweat-Free Campus Campaign, an initiative of United Students Against Sweatshops, “in which students organize anti-sweatshop campaigns on
their campuses, mandating that the clothes bearing their collegiate logos be manufactured under fair and ethical conditions.”

It is startling that Davidson’s bookstore could be full of garments constructed by exhausted, ill-treated laborers, but organizations like USAS
are striving to make college sweatshirts sweat-free. Abad’s presentation emphasized that the clothes we wear are the result of someone’s
labor, and it is our social responsibility as consumers to ensure that the conditions of that labor were humane. Advocates
like Abad shed light on the injustices of the global economy to help consumers realize that we need to turn
free trade into fair trade.

### Dr. Guroian

Guroian proceeded to reflect on the distinctive contributions of Orthodox Christianity to the Christian faith with a multi-media approach. He
instituted the playing of several short liturgical hymns and displayed Orthodox icons that exhibited the doctrines of creation and resurrection.Several
probing questions were raised throughout the lecture. Guroian kept his audience actively engaged by drawing parallels not only to well-known
theologians and philosophers, but also to authors such as C.S. Lewis. His comparison of a passage from Lewis’s well-known children’s
book “The Magician’s Nephew” to the Biblical creation story proved to be intriguing and insightful. The professor focused on King
Aslan’s act of singing the Narnian world into existence, portraying the event as a harmonious and musical instance of creation.
Guroian observed that this melodious account of creation embodied a “truth about God and the Creation that was often overlooked
by theologians,” who become too caught up in the strictly literal aspect of the Bible and its text. Guroian views
the Creation as “harmonious and musical, but a sacred kind of music, like a hymnal.” The description of his own
Armenian church’s Sunday hymn highlighted the manner in which the contradictory four elements of fire, earth, air, and water become
harmonious and furthered Guroian’s lecture. He then diverged into an explanation of the “music of the spheres” and depicted how
Saint Gregory viewed the “universe as an established order and a well-arranged musical harmony.” A music clip strengthened his point
and allowed the audience to receive “a sense of the rhythm of the liturgy,” Guroian said. Guroian concluded his lecture
with the assessment that “God is not an art critic or a philosopher.” Guroian further emphasized, “He [God] is instead
like a chanter who chants his order into existence and then rejoices over its beauty and harmony.” The lecture reflected
on the unique contributions of Orthodox Christianity to the Christian faith, offering his audience an enriching opportunity to understand an
important religious tradition.

Town, from page 1

Conflicts that exist between the disparate town plans will be identified and rectified in the process of developing the comprehensive
plan. One part the comprehensive plan will not go into great detail about is how to develop the town. For
example, the plan will not detail the development of a certain intersection. Instead, the plan will outline how to adapt
to the ongoing growth while still maintaining the town’s character and small-town feel. The goal is to prevent “big box
development,” according to Levine. According to the Fall 2008 edition of “The Town Message,” while many comprehensive plans just focus
on land use, “the Davidson Comprehensive Plan will target innovative models for economic development, needs of an aging population, public
art, environmental sustainability, and local governance.” This plan will look at “how government responds to growth,” Blackburn said, and the
strength of the plan will come from how well the town manages future growth. Levine indicated that the town has
been providing for affordable housing for many years. The planning ordinance requires that all developments include such housing in their
plans, and that the town has an Affordable Housing Coordinator on staff. This provision for affordable housing will continue in
the comprehensive plan. A Public Art Task Force made a recommendation to the town about public art, said Levine, and
this recommendation will be taken into account in the development of the comprehensive plan. The definition of public art is
very broad, including sculptures, benches, gardens, public art shows, and rocking chairs. The plan will also look at innovative ways
to tap into new markets in order to provide more inter-city employment, since many people who live in Davidson do
not work here, according to Blackburn. The comprehensive plan will also look at the environmental responsibility of the town. While
the town has been working toward greater environmental responsibility for many years, certain questions will be addressed such as: Should
buildings be “green,” and should town hall be transformed into a green building? Should future housing be constructed from recycled
material? And should merchants be required to recycle more? The process of developing a comprehensive plan will “rely on citizen
input,” Levine said. Research and data collection will be the immediate next step, and many public meetings will be held.
Local leaders and stakeholders like merchants and property holders will be interviewed, and there will be a series of town-wide
meetings about certain issues, like environmental responsibility. Davidson College, as a key property owner and stakeholder in the town, will
be key to the development of the comprehensive plan. Dean Shandley said that any changes that the town makes, especially
to Main Street, will affect the school, because Main Street and quite often Griffith Street act as the entrance to
the school for thousands of visitors every year. Levine said that the town values the students and thus desires their
input in the creation of the plan. Students can contribute by attending the town-wide issue meetings and voicing their opinions
about certain issues. Levine also said that the town’s eCrier, which people are able to sign up for on the
town’s website, www.ci.davidson.nc.us, will provide updates about the comprehensive plan.
