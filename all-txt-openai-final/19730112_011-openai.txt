I recently saw the film “Deliverance.” I was impressed by the situation into which these men were thrust. The life question was not one of success but of survival. Popular Humanities is the closest thing Davidson College comes to a course in survival. The only word for existing through some 3000 years of history and thought is survival. Nevertheless, it does not have the life-or-death flavor that education had in elementary school. This world of wimps needs courses in survival like those offered in the universities in the western states. We can't canoe down the Colorado River. Nor can we climb Mt. Whitney. Davidson, though, has its own peculiar set of natural obstacles. Have you ever wondered what the tower on the baseball field is for? It is for an introductory course in survival. For the first semester’s work, you must climb the tower, with or without the aid of a ladder.

Terry had masterminded a plan for totally controlling Davidson's athletic program. Early basketball scores have indicated that Terry may have already influenced this area as the Wildcat basketball team has repeatedly run up big leads before shaving the scores down to the pre-game point spread. In one case, Terry was crossed up when Lowry sank two free throws that gave the Wildcats a 20-point win instead of an 18-point win over East Carolina. Since then, Lowry has yet to appear in another game, and fear for his life has been said to have driven him to New Zealand. This incident led the agents to draw up a warrant for basketball coaches Terry Holland and Bo Brickels, who both had been earlier questioned due to their involvement in the 3-on-3 tourney. Interesting to note is the athletic department's similar inability to discover the scandal in their own midst. Athletic director Tom Scott, when asked to comment on the situation, said that he knew nothing.
