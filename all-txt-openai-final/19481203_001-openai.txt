Hall Leaders For Student Meeting Gift Fund Named

ND GOES TO GERMAN UNIVERSITY

Y CABINET CHOOSES MARBURG UNIVERSITY

$5,000.00 GOAL SET FOR GERMAN STUDENTS

During a special chapel program, the 1948 Y.M.C.A. was officially launched. This year's goal of $5,000 is to be used
in furnishing Christmas supplies for the students of Marburg University in Marburg, Germany. This donation is managed by Church World
Service. Marburg, located in the heart of the American Zone, was left completely destitute at the end of the war.
The University, working with little more than its willing students and faculty, has been trying to recover. 51 percent of
these students were wounded in the recent war. 5 percent of the total number are blind.

HOUSE RES

The annual Y.M.C.A. Christmas Gift Fund gets underway officially Monday. The campaign to raise funds for one of the world’s
needy universities has received wide enthusiasm among the students. As is customary, the drive will be conducted on the halls
by various members of the student body appointed by the Y. A supper and meeting is planned for Tuesday, December
7, at 7 o'clock, so that these members may become familiar with their duties in the campaign. The over-all success
of the gift fund depends greatly on the cooperation of the whole student body. The Y earnestly requests the cooperation
of the students.

Chief among the needs of the Marburg students is food. There is very little food to be had in or
around the town of Marburg, and the great devaluation of the mark causes this to be out of the reach
of most students. Their only food is provided by the school, for two meals a day. They need eggs, proteins,
and fats badly.

Clothing too is a problem. The deans of faculty distribute shoes and clothing only to the most needy. No clothes
are to be had elsewhere. The military clothes saved from the war are fast wearing out and the need is
thereby increasing.

Medical supplies for the University probably rank second only to food in the matter of needs. The wounded and undernourished
are constantly being forced to leave school because of inadequate supplies provided to help them. The number of pneumonia patients
is increasing.

The University of Marburg was founded in 1527. It has a colorful past and has figured importantly in the history
of Germany and of all Europe. It has a strong Protestant background, being the site of the famous conference between
Luther and Zwingli in 1529. It was a strong anti-Nazi center for years and since the close of the war
has been important in the development of democratic principles. The present student body has been screened against Nazis and represents
the finest young people of all Germany.

Pictured above in character for their parts in the Red and Black Masquers' "Arsenic and Old Lace," are (left to
right): Bill Goodrum as Dr. Einstein, John McNair as Mortimer Brewster, John Crockett as Jonathan Brewster, and Susie Jackson and
Mae Holly as the elder Brewster sisters. Other members of the cast are McNeil Upchurch, Nancy Copeland, Page Jackson, and
Gene Upchurch. The play will be presented Thursday and Friday nights, December 9 and 10.

Beaty Heads Metropolitan Government

BY JOHN HOBART

Although the student mind is prone to think that the only ruling force in these parts is the College Administration
and the austere character referred to as “the Dean,” there is another authority in the form of the local town
government, very ably headed by the Mayor. This is a typically studentish design: a scheme was once concocted whereby the
best of the hall nominated for the mayoralty. However, the townspeople, knowing that a typically student candidate, who was very
unacceptable to the townspeople, might win the mayoralty. At this stage in the game, the townspeople let the hand-picked dark
horse, who has been referred to as “a crazy fellow,” know that he had better leave town. This he did,
causing the plot to be snuffed out.

The general atmosphere of the conference was one of seriousness and intense interest. Many different views were exchanged and many
solutions to various problems were passed among the different representatives. The two main criticisms made of fraternities today are membership
discrimination and drinking. Typical of this attitude was the N.Y. Times’ only comment on the conference: that the discrimination problem
was put off until next year's meeting.

The present student body has been very enthusiastic in its attempt to live up to the ideals set forth in
their rituals and traditions. Membership discrimination and drinking are the two main criticisms made of fraternities today. Typical of this
attitude was the N.Y. Times’ only comment on the conference: that the discrimination problem was put off until next year's
meeting.Out, | Vise the tire! way with | 1st floor: Wen Goodpasture and | were not destroyed during the war,
