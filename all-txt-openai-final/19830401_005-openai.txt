SGA Patterson Court Survey Results

The following results are excerpted from the SGA Survey on Self-Selection conducted in March. 66 male freshmen, 46 on-campus fraternity
members (upperclassmen), 60 off-campus/eating house/commons males, 117 female upperclassmen, and 54 female freshmen responded to the questions.

2. What was your first impression of Davidson's social system upon initial arrival at the College? Circle one.
- A. The system is totally self-selective; any student may join any house he/she wishes: 29
- B. The system operates basically like any Greek fraternity system: 3
- C. The system is two-fold (“two-tier”), basically combining selective fraternities with open, self-selective eating houses: 25

- D: 0

4. Please place a check under the heading which you feel best describes the house in question.
- A. Operates essentially under a bid system (i.e., house selects students): 3

constitute the remainder of the percentages listed)

5. I feel that the self-selection system of Patterson Court (Circle one)
- A. Works well the way it is; no change in the present system is necessary: 0
- B. Is basically good as it is, but the system and the different houses’ rush procedures need to be
more closely monitored: 0
- C. Should be changed to allow the fraternities to extend written bids, but that the eating houses should continue
to operate under the rules of self-selection: 0
- D. Should be changed to allow each house to decide for itself whether or not to extend written bids,
or to continue to operate under the rules of self-selection: 0
- E. Should be changed, but I would make a different proposal: 0
