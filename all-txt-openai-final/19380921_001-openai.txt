Track Men Win Honors In Contest

Local Chapter of Sigma Delta Psi Takes Third in National AAU Meet

The Davidson chapter of Sigma Delta Psi, national honorary athletic fraternity, has received news that it has been awarded the
United States championship in a twelve-event track and field contest open to all sixty-two chapters of the fraternity which are
located throughout this country.

Besides this honor, several men placed in the various events that were held and received medals for this. Ned Iverson,
football, basketball, and track star, placed third in the individual all-round championship.

Two hundred and twenty-five freshman students, who have just started their courses at Davidson, formed a living "D.C." on the
college upon their arrival. The college's initials are complete to the periods in this photograph, made by Conrad Frederick Smith,
publicity man, from the top of Chambers building. This picture was made during orientation period at the one hundred and
second session of the college.—(Courtesy Charlotte Observer).

The first part of the contest was the open championships in individual events, in which any undergraduate student was eligible.
Davidson students carried off eight of the places. Crisp placed third in the shot put, Walker, Fort, and Sprunt tied
for first in the chin vault event, Wickliffe came third in the low hurdles, and Stuart Oglesby won the rope
climb. "Swede" Johnson took two thirds, one in the javelin throw and the other in the baseball throw.

The second part of the contest was the individual all-round championships. These were made up of the best records for
individuals in ten events. Iverson's total points added up to place him third in the nation.
