In the past week, a poll has been taken among a cross-section of the student body which relates to very important political matters. Yet those who were taking the poll were impressed with the indifference, the lack of thought, and the sheer laziness in political thought of a number of the students.

This is a good time to consider our political indifference. Surely it is not advocated that everyone should be equally interested in these matters, but it is emphatically advocated that we should all be interested and aware of what's going on politically.

No one can deny that Hitler had a pretty conception of American politics, for when he thought of our politics he did not think of Jefferson or of Woodrow Wilson. He knew that Mayor Hague of Jersey City made a local joke of American democracy. He knew that Mayor Kelly of Chicago made a local racket out of the New Deal. And we cannot be naive, for above all, Joe Stalin knows that when American politicians meet to conduct the affairs of a great people, the level of their discussion would not tax the imagination of a horseshoe crab. The times demand that we can no longer indulge our taste for third-rate politics, laziness, and venality, tempered by our characteristically democratic good humor. By our indifference, we abandon a large part of our power to the professionals, and then fall into apathy and cynicism when faced with the results.

A man who argues with his roommate about Truman, or listens to the convention proceedings, is taking part in politics. The man who refuses to listen or discuss politics is, in a sense, taking part in politics. But this is a purely negative and unhelpful part. Politics in a democracy are healthy in proportion to the number who participate positively and creatively. The more the public, yes, the Davidson student, thinks for itself on political issues, the less it will be swayed by its political leaders. We cannot afford to ask less of ourselves than a reform of our political behavior. We all must devote more of our spare time to politics.

### WEDNESDAY NIGHT HALL MEETINGS

Every Wednesday night at ten o'clock in your dormitory are held hall prayer meetings. These are led by various members of the student body or by members of the faculty. You will find in the hall prayer meetings a good opportunity for real fellowship, and for many enlightening and interesting bull sessions, as well as quiet meditation and a prayerful pause in the middle of a busy week. Go to the devotional held on your hall or in your dormitory next week and support these meetings.

The leaders in the various dormitories are as follows: for Watts, Amos Hardy; Georgia, Harry McLean; First floor and basement of West, Julian Hodges; second floor, Cree Hutchinson; third and fourth floors, Auny Perrin.
