RESERVE OFFICERSâ€™ TRAINING CORPS

BELIEVE IT OR NOT THIS GUY IS IN CLASS.

Excitement and adventure is the course description, and Army ROTC is the name. It's the one college elective that builds your self-confidence, develops your leadership potential, and helps you take on the challenges of command.

There's no obligation until your junior year, and that means there's no reason not to try it out right now.

ARMY ROTC
THE SMARTEST COLLEGE COURSE YOU CAN TAKE.
