THE DAVIDSONIAN

**Beyond Davidson**

Headlining the news for the week of Jan. 30-Feb. 5:

**Middle East News**
— Libya reported that it sent arms and supplies to Uganda’s new president, Yoweri Museveni, to help his guerilla forces
topple the government of Milton Obote. Haider Abu Bakr Al-Attas, the new provisional president of South Yemen, said last week
that he will seek to improve relations with the “more conservative” Arab states of North Yemen and the Gulf Cooperation
Council comprised of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates.

— a weekly news summary by JANE AURELL

The Reagan administration is delaying a proposed $1.5 billion arms sale to Jordan; administration sources report that “reviving” the arms
sale seems unlikely unless there is dramatic movement toward peace talks between Jordan and Israel. To counter a growing drug
problem, the Egyptian government is making the death penalty the mandatory sentence for convicted drug dealers. Following the breakup of
an inconclusive OPEC meeting, oil prices fell to near $15 a barrel; this is the lowest level since the late
1970s.

**African News**
— The Reagan administration told Congress that it plans to give up to $15 million in covert CIA aid to
Jonas Savimbi’s guerilla forces who are fighting the Marxist government of Angola; currently, Savimbi receives most of his aid from
South Africa. In a speech opening the annual session of the South African Parliament, President Botha offered to release black
nationalist leader Nelson Mandela in exchange for the release of Andrei Sakharov, Anatoly Shcharansky, and a South African commando captured
by Angola; an unidentified senior official reported Monday that Mandela may be released before Easter. Following his speech, Botha took
out a two-page ad committing himself to power sharing, also saying that the “wheel of reform is turning”; among the
pledges made were equal education, the abolition of the “pass laws” by July 1, and a call for blacks to
sit on a “national statutory council” under Botha’s chairmanship.

**In Other International News**
— A prisoner exchange is being negotiated between the governments of the U.S. and U.S.S.R. for the exchange of spies
being held by both sides; Anatoly Shcharansky is among the agents being considered in this exchange. Poland’s communist government is
becoming increasingly concerned with the rise of a new unofficial peace movement protesting against the Polish army; Poland does not
recognize conscientious objectors to the draft. Last weekend, France expelled four Soviet diplomats; the U.S.S.R. retaliated with the expulsion of
four French envoys. U.S. State Department officials report that the U.S. has decided to reduce aid to the government of
Haiti because of reported human rights abuses; food and humanitarian aid to the Haitian people will continue. Earlier this week
in Haiti, in reaction to increasing political violence, president-for-life Jean-Claude Duvalier declared a state of siege. Also earlier this week,
31 House Democrats signed a letter urging President Reagan to delay his expected request for military aid to the Nicaraguan
“contras” and to “unequivocally” support Central American peace talks. On Sunday, Costa Rica elected Oscar Arias as its new president.
Pope John Paul II is on a 10-day trip to India; so far he has met with the Dalai Lama
and Mother Teresa. Last week, the largest fossil find ever made in North America was uncovered in Nova Scotia; the
100,000 pieces of fossilized rock date back to “the emergence of the modern world of animals.” Finally, Sunday marks the
beginning of a new 12-year cycle inaugurating the Chinese Year of the Tiger.

**National News**
— NASA investigators believe that a malfunction in one of the solid rocket boosters was responsible for last week’s shuttle
explosion. President Reagan has appointed a presidential commission to investigate last Tuesday’s explosion which killed seven astronauts. On Friday, because
of costs stemming from lawsuits, the Searle Company withdrew from the market the TATUM-T and the CU7 (Copper 7), the
intrauterine birth-control devices most often prescribed in the U.S. On Monday, the House passed a bill calling for warnings to
be placed on all smokeless tobacco products; the Senate passed a similar bill last week.State of the Union address on
Tuesday, President Reagan urged the American people to “race for the future and reach for the stars.” Eldridge Cleaver, former
leader of the Black Panther party, announced that he will seek the Republican nomination for the California U.S. Senate seat
currently held by Alan Cranston. Clint Eastwood is running for mayor of Carmel, California. President Reagan celebrated his 75th birthday
on Thursday. Thought for the Week — “Our life is frittered away by detail... Simplify, simplify.” — Henry David Thoreau

SGA grants dance troupe charter
By THOMAS NICHOLSON

The three-year-old Davidson Dance Troupe will be getting an SGA charter this term. Given by SGA Charter and Bylaws committee,
the charter will make the dance troupe an officially established organization on campus. The Davidson Dance Troupe was established by
junior Paulette Kurani to provide students opportunities to keep up their dancing skills and provide Davidson “with another form of
art and culture, one that has been neglected in the past.” It is a non-profit organization currently with 25 members.
The troupe will begin receiving money from the college to use on costumes and equipment. Kurani said, “The funds will
give us opportunities to have more elaborate performances.” The money may also expand the troupe’s horizons: “We might be able
to travel to other communities,” said Kurani, as well as other colleges.

The troupe has expressed the need for more room. “We have been using the racquetball courts for practice, and they
don’t do so well,” said Kurani. She hopes the troupe will find some dancing space in the proposed new athletic
complex, to be built next to the Knobloch Tennis Center. Athletic Director Kit Morris said, “We hope to eliminate this
sort of problem with the new facilities.” Morris said the new facilities are scheduled for completion by Sept. 1988. There
are many organizations on campus that would like to use the new facilities. “We want to be able to respond
affirmatively to requests for space and equipment,” said Morris, “and the building won’t fully serve the community if we don’t
have space for dance.” Even though he would like to see mirrors and bars installed for the dancers, he said,
“There won’t be any large open spaces dedicated to dancing only.”

This year the Dance Troupe has danced in Davidson for Amnesty International, the town of Davidson, CROP, and the literary
arts society. There will be a full-length production of their whole repertoire on March 20, at 8:15 p.m. in Hodson
Hall. Kurani, who has been dancing for 16 years, started the troupe in order to keep up her skills. “Many
of the students used to be quite active in dancing before they came here. Some were even in dancing companies,
so it was a big letdown when they got here and found no dance organization. That’s why I started the
troupe.” Kurani stresses that there is no experience necessary to join the troupe. “We have people who have danced for
17 years, and beginners. Because we do our own choreography and choose our own numbers, we can do whatever we
want to, and we dance everything from ballet to jazz and rock and roll.”
