From the Sideline Surf & Turf

Now that it’s April, or as the New York Times describes it, “the season of fat and thin envelopes,” I recall my own college selection process, now two years past. Granted, I’ve never been approached to be the poster child for admissions here at Davidson, but I had two reasons for coming here: sailing and golf.

My fascination with sailing (along with my water credit) has been satisfied by a great class and a better club. I’ve learned how to wakeboard with the water-ski club. And, since nothing about practice at the crack of dawn appeals to me, I’ve bought Krispy Kreme doughnuts from the crew club. Frankly, though, it seems that, for a school with an entire lake campus, the students would be a little more aquatically inclined. I have no idea what the process of creating a varsity team at a Division I school entails, but I suspect it is both detailed and demanding. Nevertheless, it’s a shame that Davidson doesn’t compete in water sports at the conference level.

As far as golf goes, I was slightly disappointed to learn that the “golf course” is just three holes. Spending last summer on campus, though, was made bearable because of that modest triangle of tees. This semester, I (yes, to get my lifetime credit) signed up for the golf class. I played a little in high school, so I had the clubs, gloves, and polos—because, as we all know, sports are nothing without style. There are six of us in the class—two girls, four guys, five sophomores, one senior—and we have a blast. The PGA isn’t scouting our sessions, but we’ve definitely improved. Despite the dramatic hooks and slices that have come dangerously close to reducing our class size, some shots are indeed going straight. Not many, mind you. As we began working with driving woods last week, my first question was “Am I liable for damages to that building?” Note that the building in question would not be a problem for anyone with any skill whatsoever. Overall, though, contact with the ball is becoming fairly consistent. One kid, who will remain unnamed, is even “close to good.” With just a week left in class, we’re gearing up for our three-hole tournament, hitting the range (maybe) and talking trash.

My point is this: the PE requirements aren’t bad. I sat in an education class last year and listened to future teachers proclaim the most unnecessary core requirement at Davidson is physical education. They’re wrong. I have some great memories and hilarious pictures from my freshman flickerball team. Through sailing and skiing, I’ve met a bunch of people that I never would have seen, probably because they hang out at the lake. And golf class, despite robbing me of another hour of sleep and sending me to class with mud on the back of my jeans, has made this spring a little less stressful and a little more fun. Both of which are completely welcomed by this Wildcat.Staff Writer

This season keeps getting better and better for the men’s track and field team. The Wildcats competed at the prestigious Raleigh Relays over Easter Break, where the 4x800 relay pulled out an amazing performance. The Davidson team of Dan Gibson, Jay Jahnes, Greg Scott, and Paul Wyatt ran a blistering 7:39.33, which earned them fifth place in a highly competitive field of thirty-five schools. Not only was the time good enough to establish a new school record, but it also qualified the Wildcats for a berth in the upcoming Penn Relays.

Another outstanding performance belonged to the 4x400 team, which recorded a season’s best for the Wildcats. Junior Greg Schernecke joined Gibson, Jahnes, and Wyatt to run a 3:25.63.

The Wildcats turned around from their great performance at Raleigh to compete in the Duke Invitational this past weekend. This time around it was the individuals who shone. Gibson continued his record-breaking season as he broke his own school record in the 1500 meters. Gibson placed 6th in the seeded heat with a time of 3:49.90, a mere three seconds behind the winning runner. His time was fast enough to qualify him for the IC4A Championships at Princeton this May. Junior Jay Jahnes also ran well in the 1500, crossing the line with a time of 3:59.52.

Freshman John Leverett continued an impressive season as he led the Wildcats in the sprinting events. He was Davidson’s top finisher in both the 100-meter dash and 200-meter dash, finishing with times of 11.50 and 23.21 respectively. His time in the 200 was a season’s best. Junior Freddie Bowie had the fastest Davidson time in the 400-meter dash, running an impressive 53.76.

In the longer events, sophomore Greg Scott finished the 800 with a time of 2:00.30, while junior Jimmy Swansbrough ran the fastest time of the year for the Wildcats in the 5000-meter run, finishing in 15:34.88. The DMR relay team of Jahnes, Scott, Wyatt, and Nick Lehman also entered the record books, their time of 10:29.93 one of the ten fastest ever run by a Davidson team.

The Wildcats will compete next weekend in the Charlotte Invitational in preparation for the upcoming conference tournament.
