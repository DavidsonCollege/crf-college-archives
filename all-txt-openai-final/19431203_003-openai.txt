Frat’ Cagers
Get Underway

K A’s and Beta’s Take First
Victory

The Inter-fraternity basketball
has gotten off to a flying start with
five games scheduled to be played
this week. Interest is high as the
race for the Fraternity athletic cup
is exceedingly close at the present
time. All the participating teams
will see action this week and Coach
Pete Whittle intends to have the
round-robin tournament completed
by Christmas.

K A’s Win

In the opening game of the season
the K A’s defeated the Pi Kap’s
20-13. Freshman McAden, leading
the K A’s with 14 of their 20 points,
showed up exceedingly well and put
himself high in the race for indi-
vidual scoring honors.

In one of the closest games that
has been seen in fraternity basket-
ball in some years, the Beta’s defeat-
ed the Pika’s 10-8. The outcome of
the unpredictable contest was in
doubt until the final whistle. Alphin
was top man in the low scoring con-
test with five points.

The remaining games, which are
to be played every night, Monday
through Friday, at 7:45, are sched-
uled in the following order:

Dec. 1, Sigma-SPE;

Dec. 2, Pika-KA;

Dec. 3, Beta-Sigma;

Dec. 9, Pika-SPE;

Dec. 10, KA-Sigma;

Dec. 13, Pi Kap-Pika;

Dec. 6, Pi Kap-SPE;

Dec. 7, Beta-KA;
Dec. 8, Pi Kap-Sigma;
Dec. 14, Beta-SPE;
Dec. 15, Pika-Sigma;
Dec. 16, Beta-Pi Kap;

and KA-SPE.

’Cat Five Opens Season On Friday

Meets Morris Field in First

Hardwood Battle
The 1943-44 Wildcat basketball

squad officially opens its season
Friday night at 8:15 in the Davidson
gym against the airmen of Morris
Field. This game will be important
in that it will give some indication
of the power of the war-weakened
Cat squad.

In spite of the loss of nine letter-
men to the armed forces from last
year's crack cage team, Coach Nor-
man Shepard is rapidly building a
fighting court aggregation to send
into the wartime Southern Confer-
ence race. With Jim Lowry, the only
returning letterman, and Ed White,
of last year’s frosh team, as a
nucleus, the Cat coach has been
building a polished quintet, filling

the remaining slots with standout

frosh cagers.
Lowry is expected to head the
attack from the center position in-

stead of his usual guard slot. White
and freshman Bob Flowers will pro-
bably fill the guard positions, with
freshmen Mike Williams and Free-
man Jones in the forward slots.

A hard blow to the cagers is the
loss of Lennox Turnbull, a member
of last year’s freshman team, who
suffered an injury to his shoulder in
practice early this week. It is hoped
that he will be back in the run
after the Christmas vacation.

Closely pressing the first stringers,
whose jobs are by no means clinched,
are Sammy Hay, football captain
and ex-intramural star; J. D. Ash-
more, freshman football standout,
and Dick Chessen.

According to Coach Shepard, the
squad has shown much improve-
ment since practice started. Al-
though the team is composed mainly
of young and inexperienced players,
a good performance is expected
from them Friday night.
