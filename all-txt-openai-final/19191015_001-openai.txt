Junior-Senior Debate to be Held This Month

The Junior-Senior debate will be held this fall instead of in the spring, as formerly. Upon investigation, it was found that nearly all the society contests were scheduled for the spring term, so to equalize these contests it was decided to change the date of the Junior-Senior debate to November 1. The question for debate this year is: “Resolved, That the Labor Unions Are Beneficial to the Laboring Class.” The preliminary debate is to be held October 28 and all members of the societies who are Juniors or Seniors are urged to enter.

Watch the Feathers Fly Next Saturday

Wildcats With Blood in Their Eyes to Meet Gamecocks on Latter’s Own Roost

On next Saturday afternoon, the Wildcats will temporarily move to Columbia to declare war on the Gamecocks of the University of South Carolina. This game will be of especial interest to all Davidson and South Carolina followers, as it is the first time that the teams of these institutions have met since 1915. In that year, the Wildcats were victorious by a score of 13 to 7. Little is known as to the comparative strength of the two teams, as they have not played any games with the same opponents thus far. The Gamecocks lost their first game to the Presbyterian College of South Carolina by a single touchdown. Since that time, however, they have shown a marked increase in strength, both on the offensive and defensive. In last Saturday's struggle with the University of Georgia, they showed up particularly well, holding the Crackers to a 14 to 0 score. The Georgians scored in the first quarter and again in the last few minutes of play. In the second, third, and early part of the fourth periods, the Gamecocks worked forward passes and end runs almost at will. They several times carried the ball to Georgia's 10-yard line but lacked the punch to take it across. The whole team showed up to good advantage against their heavier opponents. The Wildcats, after winning from Guilford and Wake Forest, have lost games to Clemson and Washington and Lee by 7 to 0 scores, and will be out for blood next Saturday. A hard-fought game is expected. The probable line-up of the two teams is as follows:

Davidson, U. of S.C.
Miley......... L. E....... Moorman
Hammett...... L. T.....-.Goodman
Romefelt....... L. G........ Thomas
Brady.........2 Co vs..aee E. Smith

Seniors Show Superiority in Securing Shekels

Last to Go, but First in Average in Cotton-Picking Contest

The Seniors proved that although they were last, they were not least among the cotton pickers. They tore down the records of the other classes and put the class of '20 on top both in average and individual record. On the morning of Friday, October 10, the Seniors stepped down from their throne of accustomed dignity and launched out into the cotton fields with the determination to show up the other classes, their results being close to their determination. Thirty-two men were stationed at the Puser place and twelve at Cathey’s. When 5:30 came, 39 tanned and red-faced Seniors plodded their weary way back to school, bringing with them both the class and individual record. The results of the 39 men being 3541.5 pounds, averaging 85.6 pounds per man, which averaged over 12 pounds more per man than the other classes. This brought the contest to a close and it might well be added, it was a howling success. All credit is due Col. Mueller for his most untiring efforts in carrying the plans out. The student body wishes to extend their most hearty thanks to the ladies of the faculty for the bountiful and delicious donations of beverages, cakes, doughnuts, and sandwiches which they sent to the cotton pickers. As prizes in the individual contest, the White Drug Store and Jetton Drug Store gave two soda tickets each. Those winning from each class are: W. C. Neal, of the Senior class, with a total of 212 pounds; N. P. Baber, of the Junior class, with 126 pounds; G. N. Neal, of the Sophomore class, with 260 pounds.

W. & L. Wins From Wildcats, 7 to 0 ---Generals Good Ground Gainers

Plucky Fight Made Against Heavier Opponents—Black, Spann, and Hammett Individual Stars for Davidson

Washington and Lee wiped out last year’s defeat at the hands of Davidson by trimming the Wildcats 7 to 0. The game was hard-fought on both sides from start to finish. Davidson's defense gave way in the final quarter, however, and the Generals by straight line bucking scored the only touchdown of the game, Matson carrying the ball over. After the first half, the Generals had their “Tar Heel” opponents outclassed in every stage of the game. The Wildcat backfield was unable to gain through the heavier line of W. & L. and was forced to resort to end runs. Forward passes were completely smothered by the Generals, who would simply cut Douglas and Miley off their feet by their terrific defensive. Only one pass in eight tries was completed by the Red and Black aggregation. On the other hand, Washington & Lee pulled off six or seven aerial attacks, the ends getting around their opponents’ line in quick fashion. The White and Blue machine gained most of its ground through the line. The lighter line of Davidson could not hold up under the constant hammering of the Generals’ offensive and although it did not at any time except once break, holes were opened up into it on nearly every line play. Washington and Lee did very little gaining around the ends. Silverstien, the big Washington and Lee fullback, did most of the ground gaining for the winners. He tore through the line by his spectacular line plunging, gaining from three to eight yards on nearly every play. In the last quarter, Davidson attempted to punt. The punt was blocked, Davidson recovering. The Generals’ line held and the ball went over. The Blue and White machine opened up a series of line plunges and carried the ball right down within five yards of the goal. Here they were penalized 10 yards for holding. Silverstien attempted a drop kick from the 15-yard line and missed by inches. Davidson secured the ball on their own 20-yard line.

Spann, Leader of the Wildcats, Gridiron Is Recognized as One of the South’s Best Quarters

Henry Spann, captain of this year's football team, has shown himself to be one ofthe best quarterbacks the South has seen for many seasons. His reputation was established in 1917 when the yards, D. Lee successfully went over the line, and advanced the ball to midfield. The half ended with the ball in Washington and Lee’s possession in midfield. Davidson received the kick-off and ran the ball back to the 30-yard line. They failed to gain and were forced to punt. Washington and Lee ran the punt back to midfield and began an aerial attack which netted them 25 yards. Davidson's line held and the ball went over. Davidson gained a few yards but failed to make first down. Washington and Lee completed two successful forward passes and advanced the ball to Davidson's three-yard line. Matson carried the ball over for the only touchdown on an off-guard play. Goal was kicked. Washington and Lee 7: Davidson 0. The ball remained in midfield during the remainder of the quarter. At the beginning of the fourth quarter, Davidson played hard for a spurt and then the line began to weaken. Silverstein tore off five and six yards at a time and finally advanced the ball to Davidson's 10-yard line. Washington and Lee fumbled and recovered. Silverstein carried the ball to the two-yard line and the whistle blew ending the game. Final score: Washington and Lee 7: Davidson 0.

Washington and Lee received the ball in the first quarter and advanced the ball to Davidson's 30-yard line. Here the Wildcat defense stiffened and the ball went over on downs. Davidson was playing her best during the entire game and by a series of end runs and over tackle plays succeeded in advancing the ball to Washington and Lee's 10-yard line. The necessary punch was lacking and Davidson lost her only chance to score. The ball went over and Washington and Lee, being unable to advance, punted to midfield. Davidson advanced the ball to the 30-yard line, and here lost it on downs. The quarter ended with the ball in Washington and Lee’s possession on their own 35-yard line. Davidson held the Generals for downs and the ball went over. Unable to gain, Davidson punted and Washington and Lee ran the punt back to midfield and began an aerial attack which netted them 25 yards. Davidson's line held and the ball went over.
