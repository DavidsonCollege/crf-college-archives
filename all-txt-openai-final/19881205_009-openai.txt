**Basketball Cats 1-3: after San Juan Shootout, loss to Wake Forest**
**Freshman guard Elder out for six weeks**

By LARRY DAGENHART

The 1988-89 edition of Davidson basketball opened its first season as an independent with a 57-55 win over Southwest Texas
State in the first round of the San Juan Shootout. The Cats were lucky to win as they committed 25
turnovers and made only 19 of 42 free throw attempts. Nine of those misses were front ends of one-and-one opportunities.

“That’s probably a national record for missed free throws,” said Coach Bobby Hussey. “But I’m happy to win,” he added.

Davidson led by eight at halftime, 31-23, and in the second half by as many as 14 after Dick Seidel
made two free throws to put the Cats up 49-35, topping an 11-4 Davidson run. Southwest Texas State cut Davidson’s
lead to two at 55-53 with 1:07 to play, but Bruce Elder, who led the Cats with twenty, hit two
free throws to extend the lead to four. Southwest Texas State missed a field goal attempt on its next possession
and Magic Gaines, who was fouled as he snagged the rebound, missed the one-and-one. The Bobcats rebounded and got a
basket from Torgeir Bryn to pull back within two with 15 seconds remaining. Although the Bobcats rebounded yet another missed
Davidson foul shot, they ran out of time and never got a shot off, sealing a Wildcat victory.

Saturday’s semifinal game was another story. Davidson shot a disappointing 18-39 from the floor and was out-rebounded 30-15 in a
67-44 loss to South Carolina State.

“We were just a bad basketball team tonight,” said Hussey. “We didn’t do anything well.”

The big blow Saturday was the injury of Elder, who led all scorers in his first college game the previous
night. Elder broke his hand during an afternoon practice, putting him out of action for what could be six weeks.

Sunday, in the consolation game, Davidson got the privilege of playing nationally-ranked (#11) Villanova and fell 63-47. Villanova was led
by Doug West, who scored 18 points, 12 of which came on three-point field goals. Alan Hunter led Davidson with
fifteen and was the only Davidson player in double figures.

“They simply have too much talent and ability,” said Hussey. “We were doing a good job defensively in the first
half then West got those quick three-pointers.”

Villanova led 36-21 at halftime and later in the second half by as much as 28 (55-27). Davidson did not
get a field goal in the second half until the eleven-minute mark but eventually trimmed the final margin to sixteen.

On Wednesday, the Cats made their first appearance in the new Charlotte Coliseum against ACC foe Wake Forest. The scene
was different, but the story was the same: Davidson scored only 47 points in a poor offensive performance. Wake Forest
prevailed by nine, 56-47. The Deacons jumped out to a 20-8 lead in the first half, as the Wildcats struggled
offensively, shooting only 31% from the field. At the half, Wake Forest led 30-20. The Wildcats made a run early
in the second half and closed the gap to four at 36-32. Instrumental in this assault were juniors Jay Schmitt
and Alan Hunter. Schmitt led all Davidson scorers with fourteen points, and Hunter made several key plays in the run.
Davidson again pulled within four at 44-40 with seven minutes to go, but the offensive woes resurfaced, and Wake Forest
scored 12 points to Davidson’s seven over the final minutes. Sam Ivy led the Deacons in scoring with fifteen.

The Cats returned to the cozy confines of Johnston Gym Saturday only to be whipped by Wofford 71-49 in a
late game. Eckerd College visits tonight.

The football decisionexamined By HAP BRYANT

In an issue wrought with so much emotion, I hesitate to walk where angels may fear to tread. The decision
to change the status of the football program from Division I-AA to Division III so intimately affects many members of
the college community that a columnist is in a no-win situation when addressing the issue. However, the question and the
apparent answer are both important to life here at Davidson, so it is necessary to examine the decision to lower
the football program.

First, there is the personal side. Many football players could not receive a Davidson education without the help they get
from the Wildcat Club. In Division III, this aid must end. The Admissions and Financial Aid Office will take up
some of the slack in its packages, but certainly, this will not be enough for many football players. The recent
decision basically, without any prior warning, told these students that they will have to fend for themselves financially. This is
unfair and a travesty.

Furthermore, most, if not all, current football players and coaches came to Davidson under the assumption that they would have
a five-year period to right the program. Apparently, after four years, the Trustees have decided not to honor this commitment.
Was it a gentleman’s agreement or a contract? In either case, it seems grossly wrong for the Trustees to renege
on their commitment to the football players and coaches. Why? Because honor is the Davidson way.

Then there is the public side. The issue gets very tricky here. On a personal level, it does not take
a genius to figure out that the decision was wrong. However, the public perceptions cloud such an inherently simple issue.
In the last four football seasons, Davidson has won two games, both against Wofford College, which competes in NCAA Division
II. Not since 1982 has Davidson beaten a Division I foe. Now, like it or not, in a futile situation
like this, people are going to start asking questions. The failure of the football program to give any signs of
improvement on the scoreboard has caused Davidson public embarrassment. Every school wants to have successful athletic programs. It is not
enough to say, “We are the smallest Division I school by far, and we uphold high academic standards.” People want
to see wins on the scoreboard, not moral victories that still go down as losses. No matter what the official
statement says, the lack of success on the gridiron caused the move to Division III. Had the team won two
or three games this year, the Trustees would have probably decided to wait another year. Unfortunately, the football program seemed
to continue its past tradition, and the Trustee Athletic Committee could not stand it any longer.

What second-guessing this produces! Apparently, had the ball bounced Davidson’s way on one or two occasions, had the East Tennessee
field goal kicker lost his balance in the waning moments of the game against Davidson, etc., the football program would
have continued in Division I. If a bullfrog had wings...

Why all the rhetoric about finances? In talking to President John Kuykendall, Athletic Director Kit Morris, and football coach Vic
Gatto, I got the impression that Division III is not a cheaper prospect than Division I, at least for football.
So, it seems that someone is trying to pull the wool over our eyes. Once again, we find honor at
the bottom of the issue. The administration and Trustees owe every member of the Davidson community an honest explanation for
the decision. Was the decision the right one to make? In the long run, probably so. But that does not
make it any easier for the players or coaches who are immediately affected. Nor does it mean that the issue
has been handled in the right way. Because it hasn’t.
