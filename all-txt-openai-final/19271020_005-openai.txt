THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER 20, 1927

Dr. Martin Participates in Log College Program

President of Davidson College Delivers Interesting Sermon From Germantown Pulpit

Dr. Martin has returned from his trip North to the celebration of the two hundredth anniversary of the founding of
Log College in Germantown, Penn. On the first Sunday of his trip, Dr. Martin filled the pulpit of Dr. John
C. Calhoun in that city. Dr. Calhoun is the father of J. C. Calhoun, class of ’27.

On the following Tuesday, Dr. Martin attended the exercises at Mishaminy Church, about 20 miles from Philadelphia. The pastor of
this church many years ago was Rev. William Tennent, who was the founder of Log College. A group of Christians,
led by Rev. Mr. Tennent, founded the college in 1727 and thus were the pioneers in Christian education in the
United States. The college did not flourish in its early days but was eventually the beginning of a great institution,
Princeton University and Seminary.

During the morning session, “The Work of Women in Education” was discussed. The afternoon was spent in a rehearsal of
the history of Log College and a visit to the site of the old school, which consisted of one very
rough log cabin. Here a tablet was unveiled to the memory of William Tennent.

On Tuesday night at the Bellview-Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia, a banquet was held, at which there were some 300 guests
present. Four speakers, one of which was Dr. Martin, entertained the group. Mr. Martin spoke on the subject, “The Common
Aims of a Christian College.” Dr. Martin spent the following two days in New York City on business, coming down
to Baltimore on the 8th, where he spent the weekend and then returned to Davidson.

Students to Hear Inspiring Speakers

The local Y. M. C. A., through Howard Arbuckle, chairman of the committee making arrangements for speakers, has prepared a
very interesting schedule for the remainder of the fall. The programs will be headed by unusually outstanding men representative of
their own walk of life, and whose interests vary from journalism and business to preaching. The “Y” is striving to
bring to the men on the Hill a series of practical, helpful, and inspiring messages through men who are vitally
interested in college men, and who have their interests, problems, and desires at heart.

On October 23rd, the speaker at the “Y” service will be Mr. Tom Glasgow, a man already well known to
the Davidson student body, and a man who never fails to stir and thrill a fellow’s thinking and interest. In
addition to Mr. Glasgow, the “Y” is making in some cases, and already has in others, definite arrangements to bring
to Davidson such men as Dr. E. G. Gammon, of Charlotte; Dr. Vander Meulen, of Louisville, who will conduct the
fall services; Mr. Douglas Rights, of Winston-Salem, N. C.; Mr. Morgan Blake, sports editor for the “Atlanta Journal;” Bishop Penick,
of this Diocese, and Dr. J. S. Foster, of Winston-Salem. This outline can be supplemented by the regular Christmas service,
which, this year, will be the object of especial thought and planning in order to make it a real, worthwhile,
and helpful student service.

All in all, the “Y” this year is effecting a work that merits the keenest interest and cooperation on the
part of the student body, whose wishes formulate the purposes of the “Y’s” work. If you are not, start today
to be a loyal supporter of this organization, which, traditionally speaking, has been an essential part of every Davidson man’s
college life.

SOUTHERN POWER COMPANY

The will of God, ye will know the will of God.” A conscience enlightened by the Word of God will
hold its course despite the gloom of intellectual doubts. Experimentation is doing, and action makes the battle more real and
you have a better chance of winning. Faith in God and His Word does not mean that one must know
all the details of Biblical authorship which puzzles scholars. We need a picture of the living Christ and the details
of construction are not of vital importance. The ideals of the Kingdom of God must be made the ideals of
this world. The Golden Rule must be made the rule of conduct among nations and individuals of the earth, and
youth must assume the leadership in this movement of facing squarely the issues of

Sophomore Colors Selected Recently

At a recent meeting of the Sophomore class, the class voted to have the colors of Blue and White. Several
combinations were submitted by a committee and the final vote was between the two combinations of Red and White, and
Blue and White, the color Blue and White winning out in the end. The committee appointed to submit the colors
was composed of E. E. Marsh, chairman, A. T. Edleman, and J. A. Moore. The class pennant will be selected
within a short time.

The plans for “Stunt Night” have not yet been completed, but a committee composed of J. Mathews, E. C. Close,
H. R. Mobley, A. Frew, and S. C. Coker, under the direction of John Foster, are working on it. The
committee has asked all members of the class to turn in ideas for a stunt to some member of the
committee. The committee has no definite idea in mind, but is trying to work up a play in which members
of the class will have an opportunity to show their dramatic ability and also do their part in helping the
Glee Club put over “Stunt Night” in grand style. The committee is anxious to have as good a stunt as
is possible for all the alumni and student body will be there to witness the show.

FEW CHANGES MARK STUNT

The entire supervision of the Stunt Night performance is in the hands of the Glee Club and particularly directed by
Professors Cullum and Erwin. One of the feature numbers which has been announced is a vocal solo by Mrs. Cullum,
who is a noted musician, having appeared in many outstanding programs in leading musical circles. Complete details will be arranged
shortly and announcements will be forthcoming from the directors of the program as to additional features and attractions. One statement,
however, is made at present, and that is that all numbers will be of the highest type and that the
entire program will be of strictly first-class degree.

SPIRIT OF MIRTH OF JOY

Immediately after, there will be an alumni luncheon where there will be a get-together of all the men and enjoyable
discussions will be heard. The afternoon will be well supplied with excitement when the Davidson College Wildcats meet the Cadets
of V. M. I in what promises to be one of the best football battles of the season. The Red
and Black team will be seen staging a great fight to keep uncrossed a goal line which has never been
shadowed by an opponent, that of Richardson Field. This will be the feature of the program. The evening will be
taken up with stunts given by the classes and various student organizations on the annual Stunt Night. This is one
of the most enjoyable of the activities of the students during the year and this will prove no exception with
much humor and mirth. Plans are to make this the greatest day for the alumni that has ever been staged
here and from the present sale of seats for the football game, it looks as though there will be a
record-breaking crowd on hand.
