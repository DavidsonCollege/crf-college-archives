From page 5:

And I said yes. After preaching there, I decided that I would like to become a pastor rather than return to counseling. The church asked me back for sixteen Sundays. At this point, my father told me that I had a good chance to become pastor of the church, but that I needed a part-time job in the meantime. With my father’s encouragement, I put in an application for a job here at the college. Having grown up in Davidson, I had seen blacks employed at the college only in domestic-type jobs, so I didn’t really expect that I would be hired. And I didn’t really want the job because of the small-town atmosphere; I had seen the world and I liked it better than Davidson. To say the least, I was surprised when I got the job. I took it because I felt that it was God’s will and I was committed to do His will. The job gave me the opportunity to do something I had vowed to do as a child. As a child, the major...Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

Intellectual stimulation I felt came from Davidson, its programs and faculty. Ever since then I wanted to give to Davidson some of what it gave to me.

Q. What was it like to grow up in Davidson and then return to work after so many years?

A. Growing up was not easy, because Davidson is a small town. I always felt that the railroad tracks were a wall. Coming back was quite a shock because in Atlanta many of my friends were white and we never thought of each other as being black or white—we were just friends. I had “forgotten” what it meant to be black in Davidson.

Q. Has being black or being a woman hindered you in any way?

A. No—I have always been my own worst enemy. I define myself from the inside out, rather than from the outside in, so I need only to depend on my own feelings and ideas concerning myself, instead of on what others think. I never gave society enough credit or power to let it define my being, and I always felt that whatever I received would be by God’s will.

Q. How do you feel about the way the college is celebrating Black History Month?

A. I would prefer that the college be more inclusive of black history and culture. We do not celebrate White History Month. The college needs to integrate black history and culture with white history instead of celebrating it once a year.

Q. What are your goals for the future?

A. I don’t really have any long-term goals because I prefer to set goals according to where I am at the moment. I do hope that before I leave Davidson I will see a Vice-President of Minority Affairs established. I feel that Davidson can be a better college because I see it as it can be and as God wants it to be. Right now, it is better than most other schools because it will not enroll black students just because of their race and because it will not lower its standards for any reason. I hope for a time when the campus will have a racial and cultural diversity that is natural and without prejudice.
