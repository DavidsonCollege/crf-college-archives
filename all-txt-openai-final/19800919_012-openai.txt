Union Art Gallery

Interested in owning original animation cel paintings? The Union will be hosting an exhibit and sale of more than 250
individual cels—one-of-a-kind, cartoon paintings that have been actually filmed. The cartoon characters include Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Raggedy
Ann and Andy, Betty Boop, and Krazy Kat among others.

The exhibit and sale will be Thursday and Friday, September 18 and 19, from 9 a.m. until 6 p.m. According
to a recent article in Family Circle magazine, animation art is now the hottest collecting area within the field of
comic art. On hand to answer questions will be a representative of Gallery Lainzberg, the nation’s best-known specialists in this
art form.

900 Room

All day Saturday will be a children’s Art Fair Show sponsored by the Davidson-Cornelius Day Care Center.

Marty Bear, singer and guitarist, will be performing Friday and Saturday nights at 9:30 and 11:00. A native of New
York City, he has entertained throughout the East Coast. Critics call him "the voice of the '80s." He gives his
show an unrestricted tone with his spontaneous, witty humor, and his repertoire includes a variety of today’s music along with
his original cuts from his upcoming album.

For anyone who wants to practice speaking Spanish without the structured lines of a class, a group will be meeting
on Wednesday nights. Navarro will also be at the meetings, so come and share cultural ideas.
