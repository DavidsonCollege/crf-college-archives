- There were no Spring Frolics for the baseball team Friday night in Chapel Hill. Instead, there was a cloud of dust and a questionable call at home plate in a 1-0 loss to the Tar Heels.

Sophomore southpaw Doug Wiley twirled a masterful five-hitter, his second consecutive impressive losing performance. Wiley walked the leadoff batter but rode a no-hitter through four innings and into the fifth when he finally surrendered a single.

The Carolina starter didn’t tire from the pace, either. He had a perfect game through three innings, a no-hitter through four, but in the crucial fifth, he yielded two singles to a win-starved and vengeful Wildcat team.

In the top of the fifth, Scott Redding stood at second with two out. Pinch hitter Mick Smith stepped to the plate and hit a ground shot to the shortstop. Redding crossed the ball’s path right in front of the shortstop, who subsequently misplayed an otherwise easy play. Redding rounded third as the shortstop fired to first, but his throw was in the dirt. The first baseman had to come off the bag for the play, and he threw to home to prevent Redding from scoring. Redding beat the throw, but the umpire claimed he never tagged the plate. Final and standing verdict—out.

The ump didn’t have a say when the Tar Heels scored the next inning. A leadoff single set the Heels in motion, and the runner moved into scoring position with a steal. The next batter lined a single to right, but Earl Ransom couldn’t make the throw to the plate. Wiley ended a sparkling complete game with seven hits and a walk, but a loss despite his mound heroics.

The other scheduled games were rained out, but they play tomorrow at Johnson City, Tennessee, and then return home Wednesday for a rematch against UNCC.

### All Lanes Lead to Furman

For the men’s track team, last Saturday’s Furman Invitational was a succession of “almosts” as time after time, Davidson tracksters gave good efforts only to finish in seventh place.

The fastest of these near misses came as Franklin Ivey ran a seventh-place 4:02.9 in the 1500 meter. This was his best time by 4 seconds as he ran a tough race from start to finish but still came up short. Danny Armistead began this trend with a gutsy 10:12.8 in the steeplechase. Although it looked like his strong, steady pace and good kick would haul down the last rivals standing between himself and a scoring position, his effort wasn’t quite enough. Alec Driskill placed seventh in the triple jump, watching as Brevard’s Major Tallent beat his best jump by half an inch.

Lance Sisco, however, managed to salvage a fourth place despite almost missing his start in the 110m High Hurdles. Caught by surprise, he flubbed his pre-race preparations and ran a flustered 14.5 in that event. This time appeared to be Lance’s fastest effort thus far this season, but since it was a hand time, it probably represented a slightly slower race than his 14.6 at the Davidson Relays. Nonetheless, Lance approaches the Southern Conference meet with sharpened form for a rematch with James Orr of Appalachian State, who has narrowly defeated him twice this spring.

Another place-getter for the track team was high-jumper Jeff Carter, who’s been sidelined for three weeks with a twisted ankle. Jeff placed sixth with a leap of 6’6”, an excellent first-time-back performance, and had a very close miss at a school-record 6’8¼”. Randy McManus also gave a good performance, finishing third in the 5000m run with an almost-PR of 15:10 despite running the first part of the race boxed in by two Citadel runners and the last part of the race with no competitors close at hand either in front or behind him.

The other major highlight for the team was its 800m runners. Dave Stosur and James Gelly ran close to the front in the first heat, both recording 57 seconds in their first laps. James moved hard down the back straight but was passed again by Dave around the final curve and down home as he ran a 2:00.5 to Dave’s 1:59.3. In the second heat, John Hoots ran a strong race against a classy field. His 1:59.6, however, was almost 10 seconds behind the winner, a Kenyan running unattached, who powered down the home stretch and, not knowing where the finish line was, ran 20 yards beyond before realizing the win was his. An impressive run by both competitors. Coach Sterling Martin is now lamenting the fact that there is no 4x800m relay in the conference meet as those three and Frank Ivey would make a fine relay team.

Davidson will leave for the Southern Conference meet Friday morning. Most of the finals will be on Saturday, however, and our track team is going into that day’s races with high hopes for some better luck than their just-out-of-the-money finishes at the Furman Invitational.
