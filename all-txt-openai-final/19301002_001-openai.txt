Will Fill Dr. Moffett’s Pulpit Sunday Morning for First Service

**IS OUTSTANDING MAN**  
Second Visit Dr. Lacy Has Paid Davidson for Services

Next week Davidson will have the extreme honor and pleasure of having Dr. B. R. Lacy, Jr., president of Union Theological Seminary and one of the ablest ministers in the Southern Presbyterian Church today. He will be Davidson’s guest from Sunday, October 5, through Tuesday, October 7. All of his services, with one exception, will be held in the auditorium of Chambers. The first will be held Sunday morning at the regular church service at the Davidson Presbyterian Church. Dr. Lacy will fill Dr. Moffett's pulpit on that day. The next service will be held in Chambers Auditorium in which the “Y” vespers and the Presbyterian Church will be combined into one service. There will be no services held in the church that night. He will hold a service at each of the chapel services Monday and Tuesday, the classes will be cut five minutes short so that the services will be longer and so that Dr. Lacy will have all the time that he wants to speak. He will also hold a service on Monday and Tuesday nights at 7:30. While he is here he will meet with the various fraternity groups and also with various organizations on the campus. While here he was a member of the Richmond. Dr. Lacy is also expected to give a talk to the Ministerial Band when they hold their regular meeting on Sunday afternoon. He will meet with the other groups at other times. He will also hold conferences with the boys in the college who desire to meet with him and talk with him. There will be slips of paper distributed to the students in chapel Monday and Tuesday and anyone desiring to meet with him may fill out one of these slips. These services and conferences are similar to those conducted by Dr. Will Anderson and Dr. Sam Glasgow, who were here last year to hold revivals. Albert McClure will have charge of the interviews of Dr. Lacy. The song leader will (Continued on page 5)

#### Rifle Team To Have Many Veterans Back
Matches Are Being Sought With Various Teams

A veteran team of sharpshooters will represent Davidson College on the Rifle Team this year, as almost every man from last year’s team returns for competition in the gallery this year. Those returning are: Brock, J. L., Russell, R. D., Wiley, S. S., Gregory, R. K., Graham, H. W., Brohard, M. L., Curtis, F. Burgess. These men are those who shot in a shoulder-to-shoulder match with Gastonia last spring. The regular competitive season will not open until after Christmas, but a call will be made soon for Freshmen and additional upperclassmen interested in trying out for the Rifle Team. After which practices will be held in the afternoon several times a week, but not much shooting will be done until after Christmas. Shoulder-to-shoulder matches are being sought with V. P. I., V. M. I., Clemson, N. C. State, Gastonia, and possibly a few others. Together with these, an average of five correspondence matches a week make up the routine of all the Rifle Team’s conquests. Davidson was successful last year in both shoulder-to-shoulder matches and winning her share of the matches. The Wildcat Rifle Team was ranked ninth among teams in the Fourth Corps Area, which is a creditable showing considering the stamp of teams in this section.

#### Kuykendall and Gorman Chosen to Lead Cheers
Assistant Cheer Leaders Chosen From Junior Class After Four Ballots

At the election held recently by the student body, E. D. Kuykendall and E. R. Gorham were elected Junior cheerleaders to assist the varsity cheerleaders George McClenaghan, this year. A series of elections were held to eliminate all but two of the candidates. The following men were eliminated before the two victors were elected: Bob Davis, Sam Wiley, Henry McKinnon, Norman Raies, Riley Powell, Alex St. Clair, Bob Torrence, J. T. Welch, Ben Mosely, and J. E. Clue. Kuykendall is a member of the Kappa Sigma social fraternity and a member of the Forensic Council. He was the first one elected in this election. He won a numeral in track in his freshman year and was one of the stars of this team. He was also on the squad of last year, and although he did not win his letter, he showed up well in the tryouts. Gorham is a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon social fraternity and the Beaver Club. Last year he won his letter as a member of the wrestling team. He, like Kuykendall, won a numeral in track in his freshman year and was on the 1929 squad. Next year one of the two Junior cheerleaders will be elected varsity cheerleader to replace the present cheerleader, George McClenaghan.

#### Work on Humor Magazine is Started

Work has been started on the new humor magazine, which came into being this year, replacing the literary “Chameleon.” By a vote of the student body, W. C. Ragin was elected to complete editorship of the new quarterly, and it was also decided that the magazine should be entirely humorous. It will be remembered that the first move to give Davidson College a humor magazine was started last year. However, it was to be divided with the literary portion of the “Chameleon.” Bob Witt was elected literary editor and W. C. Ragin was made head of the humor portion. When Bob Witt failed to return to school this fall, the student body voted to make Ragin sole editor. Over 28 candidates have applied for work on the new publication, and many of them are already at work on the first issue, which will appear about November 1. The editorial staff will be chosen after the first issue appears. Many capable artists are already out, and it is hoped that the new periodical will be freely illustrated, perhaps in colors. No name has yet been assigned to the new magazine. According to present plans, it will not be called the “Chameleon.”

#### Professors Discuss Educational Values
High Schools of Western Carolina Hear Davidson Faculty Members

In accordance with a request of the State College Association, Davidson recently sent several of its faculty members to a number of high schools to speak on the “Value of a College Education.” Every two years the College Association, in laying plans for these talks, assigns the various counties to the different association members. This year Davidson was assigned the counties of Rowan, Montgomery, Stanly, and Transylvania. Dr. Vowles spoke at Albemarle and Landis; Prof. Beatty at China Grove; Ernest Milton and Carl Pritchett at Norwood, New London and Granite Quarry; and Prof. Fleagle at Walhalla. Only about half of the high schools were included on the list for this year, since a visit to every high school would be almost impossible. However, the omitted schools will form the list to be visited next season.

#### Fraternity Averages

The Kappa Alpha social fraternity has been awarded the James C. Harper loving cup for the coming year, having made the highest average of any of the ten national fraternities. Members of this chapter averaged 86.97 for the scholastic session of 1929-1930, according to figures released by the registrar of the college. Last year the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity had the cup in their possession. Other national fraternities and their scholastic averages are Sigma Phi Epsilon, 86.80; Kappa Sigma, 85.08; Phi Delta Theta, 85.04; Pi Kappa Alpha, 84.94; Phi Gamma Delta, 84.52; Sigma Alpha Epsilon, 83.48; Theta Upsilon Omega, 83.30; Beta Theta Pi, 83.29; and Pi Kappa Phi, 80.67. The James C. Harper loving cup was given by James C. Harper, of the class of 1915, in honor of his father and grandfather, and is annually presented to the fraternity which has the highest average. If won three times successively, it automatically becomes that fraternity’s property, but no fraternity group has been able to accomplish this since the cup was offered.

#### Social Fraternities End Rushing Season

September 26 brought to a close three weeks of intensive rushing by the social fraternities at Davidson. One hundred and ten men, almost one-half of the Freshman Class, were reported Saturday morning to have aligned themselves with one of the ten social fraternities on the campus. Of the 110 pledges,100 are of the freshman class. Nine upperclassmen also became affiliated with various organizations, and one member of the faculty, Prof. H. F. Fulcher, became a pledge to the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity. The percentage of men receiving bids this year was slightly larger than in years past. According to the rules of the college, the men will not be initiated until after the mid-year examinations. The names of the new pledges with upperclassmen and faculty member specified are as follows:

Beta Theta Pi: Atlanta, Ga.; Frank Holt, N. C.; James H. McClintock, Harold T. McMillan, Charlotte; Rufus C. Morrow, Jr., Zitacuaro, Michoacan, Mexico; Rawling Pratt-Thomas, Wedgefield, S.

DISTRICT RED CROSS GATHERS FOR MEET

Cornelius-Davidson Chapter Will Be Hosts on October 9

The annual meeting of the Western North Carolina District of the American Red Cross Society will be held at Davidson on October 9, according to an announcement made here following a meeting of the committee during the past several days. Eighty-three chapters will be represented in the gathering, which will be addressed by Miss Mabel T. Boardman, of Washington, D. C. Mr. A. D. Cornelius, chairman of the local Cornelius-Davidson chapter, presided over the meeting which made plans for the gathering. Mrs. J. H. Frye, of Charlotte; Miss Beard, Cornelius; Miss Cornelia Cashion, of Cornelius; Dr. Shaw, librarian of Davidson College; W. L. Lingle, president of Davidson College, and M. Richards, professor in the college, were among those present.

The principal speaker, Miss Boardman, is secretary of the National Red Cross Society. For a long time she has been connected with the Red Cross work in America, and has received numerous decorations from the governments of the world for her services in this cause. She will be introduced by Mrs. Edwin Gregory, of Salisbury. The program will start at 10 a.m. and conclude at 3 o'clock. A luncheon will be served to the delegates at noon in the banquet hall of the new Chambers Building of Davidson College. Dr. H. B. Arbuckle, member of the Davidson faculty, will preside over the morning session, and a greeting to the guests will be extended by Dr. Lingle.

Local townspeople will be invited to attend the luncheon and afternoon sessions, while the morning session will be reserved for a business meeting, during which time the affairs of the Western District will be discussed.

President Hoover is Unable to Visit Here

Dr. Lingle Is Notified By President of Previous Engagements

President Herbert Hoover has notified Dr. Lingle that owing to previous engagements he would be unable to visit Davidson College when he comes to North Carolina to speak on October 7 at the celebration of the Battle of Kings Mountain. A letter was despatched to him on September 25 by Dr. Walter Lingle, president of the college, who wrote on behalf of the faculty and students of Davidson, earnestly requesting him to accept this invitation. Dr. Lingle reminded President Hoover that the late President Woodrow Wilson “took part of his college course here, and honored us with a visit while he was President.” He went on to say that “the college was founded by the sons of the Scotch-Irish Presbyterians who fought and won the Battle of Kings Mountain.”

If President Hoover had been able to accept the invitation of the Davidson College faculty and student body, it was hoped that he would be able to make a few brief remarks while on the campus. In his letter, Dr. Lingle expressed this wish when he said, “we do want you to know that we earnestly hope that you can pause long enough to pay Davidson College a visit and say at least a few words to our students and faculty.”

The latest busts to be placed in the Hall of Fame include those of James Fenimore Cooper, Elias Howe, George Bancroft, Horace Mann, Joseph Story, Patrick Henry, John Lothrop Motley, James Russell Lowell, and John Quincy Adams.

CATS DEFEAT STATE 12-0 AT GREENSBORO IN FIRST NIGHT GAME

Seven Thousand Fans Watch Two Teams Engage in Hard-fought Contest

DEFENSE FEATURE OF GAME

McCall and King Are Stars for Victors

The Davidson Wildcats had their first taste of night football in the Memorial Stadium at Greensboro last Saturday, but the novelty of the thing did not hamper them in their 12 to 0 victory over N. C. State's touted Sophomores. An overflow crowd of 7,000 people saw the two elevens engage in a contest marked by the scarcity of ground gained, Davidson making six first downs to State’s two. Joe McCall, fleet halfback of the Wildcats, gave the fans their first offensive thrill of the game. Towards the end of the first quarter, the fans were becoming reconciled to seeing a punting duel, when McCall slipped out of the Wildcat haven and sprinted 37 yards for the first tally of the game. It was an off-tackle play, and once in the open ground he evaded and outsprinted the State secondary defense, crossing the goal line before the bewildered State eleven realized what had happened.

After this break, the two teams seemed to settle down to defensive ball, for only one first down was registered in the next two quarters, that by the Wildcats. The punting of Thad Brock was outstanding in these two periods, some of his boots being over 50 yards. The only gains of any consequence whatever were a 12-yard pass, Fraley to King, and a 20-yard run by King. The latter gain was offset on the following play when the Wildcats were thrown for a 15-yard loss. The punting duel was renewed in the final period with Thad Brock having the decided advantage. However, it looked for a moment as if the Wolves would get started, for “Sparky” Adams, Wolfpack field general, brought the ball up to his own 40-yard line on a beautiful 20-yard run. But his work was for naught, for a moment later Gardner, Davidson center, intercepted a Wolfpack pass, and another Wildcat drive was on. This time they were not to be denied as (Continued on page 5)
