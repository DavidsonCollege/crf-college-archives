WELCOME, ALUMNI.

In a few days the campus will be full of alumni, gathering at Commencement for the Alumni Reunion, which is to be this year's feature. They will come to make the halls and dormitories and walks ring with glad meetings and old-time shouts. Many an old familiar spot will be visited, many a familiar inscription on wood-work and cupola will be seen again with a strange feeling, many an old memory of pranks, friends, games, girls, parades, good and bad times will be recalled as the scenes suggest them. To the Alumni, all welcome. We hope these few days will be to you as a dip into the fabled fountain of youth, and that the vivid recollections of your college days here will cause Father Time to turn backward in his flight and make you a college boy again; full of spirit and enthusiasm for the great Davidson that was and is, and the greater that is to be. You have been out into the world now, you have kicked against the pricks, you have observed and been observed, and you can tell us what we need most, what Davidson needs to make it bigger and stronger and better. Once a Davidson man, always a Davidson man, is trite but true. It will be proved at Commencement. It is being proved all over the South. Davidson is at a crisis now, and now if ever, she needs the firm, united, loyal support of her alumni. Davidson ought to have an Alumni Athletic Association. Davidson needs an Alumni Association. She needs a good Freshman class next year, full of literary and athletic talent. She needs more equipment. But with the loyal alumni Davidson has, we need not fear for the coming of these.

RESPONSE.

Despite the gay and merry festivities of Commencement, the charming presence of sweet, pretty, laughing Southern lassies, there will be a tug at the heart of many a man during the coming week, as he turns his face backward on his college days at Davidson. It is hard to make a valedictory happy, it is just as hard to make a gay response. But to the Seniors who are leaving us this year, we wish every good fortune and the smile of Heaven. You will miss Davidson; certainly will we miss you when we gather again next September. The Class of 1914 has left an enviable record, and with their motto: "Loyal En-tout," they will work for Davidson loyally after their departure. Twenty years hence we expect to find the name of many a member in "Who's Who" and the annals of success and service in the South and America.

The DAVIDSONIAN. May 13, 1914

REUNIONS COMMENCEMENT FEATURE.
(Continued from page 1)

But they will probably be H. L. Elliot, W. T. Bitzer, and H. M. Marvin. On Tuesday afternoon the Senior stunt will be pulled off in Shearer Hall. A great mystery surrounds this annual Senior event. Commencement is to be closed on Tuesday by a number of receptions given by the two literary societies and the different fraternities. This is the first year that the literary societies have attempted to give an entertainment. The help of the ladies of the town has been solicited, and they have very kindly consented to help in the entertaining. The ladies who are to entertain in the Eumenean hall are Mrs. B. Arbuckle, Mrs. J. M. Douglas, Mrs. J. M. McConnell, Mrs. W. R. Grey, and Mrs. T. McConnell. Mrs. M. G. Fulton, Mrs. A. Currie, Mrs. T. W. Lingle, and Mrs. W. J. Martin are to assist in the Philanthropic hall. With the help of these ladies and the hearty co-operation of the society members, the reception must be a success, and it will become one of the established customs at Davidson.
