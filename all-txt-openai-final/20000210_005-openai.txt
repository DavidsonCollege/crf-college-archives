“Skeptical, wacky, and charming,” said Professor Allan Michael Parker in his introduction to Jill Ciment’s reading on Tuesday, January 5,
in the 900 Room.

Jill Ciment, Davidson’s McGee Professor of Creative Writing, read from her work. Ciment selected a chapter from her first novel
The Law of Falling Bodies, a story of the relationship between a mother and daughter. Ciment dazzled the audience with
clever humor and charming characters.

She began her artistic career as a conceptual artist, but she turned to writing. Influenced by Nabokov and Kafka among
others, Ciment considers herself a novelist, though she has written screenplays. Novels, she believes, truly belong to the writer, whereas
screenplays undergo many changes during the production process.

The author of three novels and a memoir, Ciment explains the difference between the novel and the memoir in terms
of visual art. She describes writing a novel as working with a blank canvas while writing a memoir is more
akin to sculpting a block of marble. When writing memoir, the artist has to work in accord with the grain
of the stone. Hence a novel has endless possibilities, while a memoir revolves around life’s experiences.

Ciment believes that a bit of biography is always present in an author’s writing. Gloria, Ciment’s mother’s name, is the
name of the mother in The Law of Falling Bodies. Ironically, the mother in Half a Life, Ciment’s memoir, has
a different name.

Ciment comes to Davidson after having lived in Los Angeles and New York City for most of her life. Ciment
doesn’t think she has had a truly American experience. She explains that Los Angeles and New York are actually international
cities, and she looks forward to experiences in Davidson, primarily its warmer temperatures. Thus far Davidson’s tranquil surroundings and the
Wal-Mart Supercenter in Mooresville have impressed her the most.

She comes to Davidson to teach. Teaching, she believes, molds a better writer and person. She explains that teaching makes
a person more analytical, which in turn helps the writing process.

Ciment sets aside time every day to write. She believes that discipline is one of the most important aspects of
writing, a point that she conveys to her students.

When she is not teaching or writing, Ciment enjoys swimming and walking Sadie, a pint-sized Dachshund.

Ciment is confident that Davidson will make a good home for the next three months.
