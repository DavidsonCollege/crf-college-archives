*By TONI CASALI*

Davidson's spring sports program got underway with a fine start last Saturday when the Tennis Club blanked the Hickory team
4-0. The golf team played a match on the course and handed Catawba a setback. In the past, it seems
that the most successful program has been the spring sports. We have always boasted good golf, tennis, and track teams,
and this year will not be an exception. The tennis team, not to be overshadowed by the tracksters, finished a
good season by ranking well among the leaders in the Southern Conference.

**Baseball Outlook**

This year, the baseball nine will make a comeback and rank with other sports mentioned above. Coach Laird has eight
veterans on the team: Hicks, Ficklin, Jim McLeod, Dick Leary, and others. The bright spot of the track team is
three veterans, John Clark and Tubby Hand, who are waging a merry battle for a spot.

**Track Meet**

The annual fraternity track meet, which was run off last week, blossomed forth with much track material. The Phi Delts,
led by lanky Jim Cowan, ran off with top honors after they had amassed a total of 42 points. Cowan
copped first place in individual scoring honors. He set new records in the 660-yard run and broad jump, along with
Ned Iverson who broke the former discus mark, Henry Baker who broke the 220-yard dash record, Nick Schiltz who set
a new record in the three-quarter mile, and Frank Harrison, who set a new record in the 120-yard low hurdles.
With all this record-breaking material on hand, the varsity and frosh coaches seem well pleased with prospects for the coming
season.

**Intramural Program**

The intramural program, along with the annual track meet, is one of the bright spots of the sports happenings on
the campus. It affords pleasure for students who are not capable of making the varsity team and certainly plenty of
good exercise. The biggest part of the program will take place after the holidays, at which time tennis, volleyball, softball,
and horseshoes will be run off, and it will be a good time for members of the student body to
get much-needed exercise. The fact that the junior class won top honors in almost every tourney so far this year
should make some of you hidden talent come out and help your class bring in a first or second place
win.

**CONCERT IS GIVEN** (Continued from Page 3)

The concert included a number of secular selections with Harper Beall as soloist. In this group were spirituals, folk tunes,
sea chanties, and the ever-popular song “Beneath the Red and Black.” The club offered as encores a novelty number entitled
“Johnnie Schmoker” and the college song “O, Davidson.” After the concert, a reception was held in the banquet hall of
Chambers, at which Mrs. Thane McDonald acted as hostess. Present were a number of girls from Agnes Scott and the
college alumni.

**Golfers Whip Catawba In Initial Appearance**

Davidson Sports Varsity Baseballers Play Practice Game; Hicks, Ficklen, Stars Regulars Register 7-0 Win Over Yannigans in First Nine-Inning Practice
Contest of 1938 Season; Pitchers Keep Good

The Davidson baseball squad held their first official practice game of the year Saturday afternoon, with the Regulars winning, 7-0.
D. Hicks and George Ficklen pitched scoreless ball for the Regulars as they led their team to a 7-0 win
over the second stringers. For seven innings, Hicks’ slants baffled the Yannigans and then Ficklen took over the job with
equal success. Hicks was touched for four hits, Ficklen two.

Pegram and Ray Pitman, Grey Hunter at short for the second stringers, led the hitting for both teams as he
banged out three for three. Fielding Clark, also of the Yannigans, got the only extra-base blow of the contest, a
two-bagger. For the regulars, Hicks was the batting hero, also getting two hits in four times up. “Tubby” Hand, leadoff
man, got one hit in all trips besides scoring two runs.

**Phi Delts Capture Third Cat Racketeers in Pre-Season Practice Runs**

Johnston Injures Arm in Javelin Throw — Crisp, Williams Look Good

Pete Whittle ran his 1938 squad of tracksters through their first intersquad meet last Saturday. The various men showed up
well and the outlook for a successful track season is good. Milton Crisp took first in the shot put contest
with a heave of 42 feet 2 inches. Bailey Williams also looked good as he tossed the discus over 131
feet. Johnson's longest javelin throw was 163 feet but in the course of the afternoon, he injured his elbow.

**Distance Runs**

Dave Woodward ran the two-mile in 10 minutes 17 seconds.

**Tennis Team In Decisive Victory Over Hickory**

Six Cat Netters Lick Hickory Tennis Club in Pre-Season Meet

Netters Take All Singles Matches, Two Doubles, in 8-1 Win; Rea Tenney Defeats Bronston Kenney For Number One Berth on
Team

Davidson's tennis team overwhelmed the Hickory Tennis Club by an 8-1 score in a pre-season meet held here last Saturday,
March 19. The Cats started off with a bang and took every singles match by decisive scores, and continued thus
until the final doubles battle in which Kennedy and Hahn of Hickory eked out a 9-7, 8-6 win over Frampton
and Reinhardt in an overdrawn affair to give the Hickory boys their only score of the day.

The best match of the day, however, was also a doubles battle. Tenney and Kenney, ranking one and two for
Davidson, came back to take the last two sets, 6-1, after Lawrence and Friday of Hickory had taken the first
set, 6-4.

The definite ranking of the Cat players for the rest of the season, even though they have played this match,
is not known, according to Manager Lloyd Feuchtenberger. Bronston Kenney, who played the number one position last year, played the
same position in this meet, but Rea Tenney, winner of the fall tournament, is expected to fill that place during
the coming meets. Kenney will then take over the number two position as he was ranked in both of the
tournaments. George Jones will round out the team’s first three points while Jim Reinhardt or Harry Frampton will have the
inside chance of filling the fourth place.

**Intramural Volleyball**

The Phi Delts captured the volleyball championship, defeating the Kappa Sigs in the finals. The team’s first meet will be
with South Carolina on Richardson Field, April 2. Last year the Cats lost only one of seven meets and are
shooting to better even this record. The next match that will be played is undecided, but either Emory University, University
of Georgia, or Florida will be the opponent.Fourth place with eight points each, hands of Joe NAL ah: high in
the race for top honors in Big Five Muehicl SiTline played with Nubia rans. The SAE's were fifth with five
tallies, and the Pi Kappa Phi’s sixth with four, and have the chance to meet the number one seeded man
Dick Shore who drew a first-round bye. Gene Vereen beat Bill Cobb and will meet Bill Hamilton next. Ted Leinbach
conquered Ray McDaniel but was beaten by Paul Bumbarger in the second round. Tyson Betty won over Bud Williamson and
will next meet Miller Sproull, who is seeded number two. Jim Ewart will meet Bob Eller next, as he won
his first-round match over Eldridge Brown. Chase Brenizer licked George McDonald and will next meet Pat Hobson, who drew a
bye. Billy Turner, seeded number three, will meet Bill Eagan in the only other match.

In last week’s matches, Fred Little beat Frank Barker to advance. In intramural volleyball, the seniors continued their coveted lead
by defeating the sophomores Monday afternoon in two decisive games. The scores were 21-6 and 21-7. Also on Monday afternoon,
the juniors defeated the frosh 21-6, 21-6. Both games were fast and full of action. In the senior game, “Beanpole
Bull” Durham starred with Tony Casali putting up a good fight for the sophs. The strong and undefeated senior team
claims at least a 10-point margin in each of its victories.

As this paper goes to press, the seniors are leading in the tournament with the juniors second, the sophomores third,
and the freshmen bringing up the rear. The intramural tourney will probably be finished within a few days, and the
inter-fraternity competition will get underway.

The Phi Delts led in the record-breaking with Cowan taking the 600-yard run and the broad jump. Schiltz placed in
six different events and made a total of 26 points. Donaldson of the Greens looked good in the javelin and
pole vault. White's time of 24.5 seconds in the 220-yard dash was good. Louis Garrou also ran well to cop
the mile in 5 minutes and 2 seconds. Donaldson threw the javelin 158 feet 10 inches to win that event.
He also took honors in the pole vault with a leap of 10 feet and 6 inches and placed in
the high hurdles, low hurdles, and high jump.

Captain Green of the Greens led the field in the 440-yard dash and tied Donaldson for honors in the high
hurdles. Arnold won the shot put as he heaved the iron ball to a distance of 36 feet 8 inches.
Nick Schiltz showed himself a stellar all-around man with wins in the 880, low hurdles, and the high jump. He
also tied Saltsman at 17 feet and 8 inches on the broad jump.

Coach Shepard brought the first two weeks of freshman baseball practice to a close with an inter-squad practice game Saturday.
A tentative first and second team was picked and numerous substitutions were made during the game. Each team took three
innings at bat at a time to save the usual time lost in changing from field to bat. The game
lasted 15 innings. Reinhardt was the starting pitcher for the first string and continued to throw for six innings after
which Coach Shepard took over the mound duties. The infield and outfield backed these men up well and held the
Yannigans to only a few runs. Horton and Craver were pitchers for the second string. Both looked good although they
did not receive the support afield that the other team gave their pitchers. Jay Bolin appeared to have the catching
position well in hand throughout the six innings that he received.

The infield looked good with Royster on first, Hogg at short, and Edmundson on third. Hitting appeared to be rather
weak although the pitchers were not bearing down. Edmundson hit best, having two homers in his collection. Royster planted a
homer in left field and Barnwell also hit well. The Yannigans’ loss was mainly due to sloppy fielding.

The backbone of the team throughout the year has been the steady, consistent shooting of the older men. Theiling, Captain
Pharr, Kunz, Woodward, and McLean have risen to the occasion in many matches and their steadying influence and consistent scores
have gone a long way in helping the team. The Davidson rifle team closes its activities and looks back with
a feeling of considerable satisfaction over a season marked throughout with earnest effort and continued improvement.
