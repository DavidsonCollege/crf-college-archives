The vanishing dollar at Davidson

Scott rejects changes in ARA services following proposal to close Rusk House

Director of ARA Food Services Ron Scott, in conference with administrators, ARA Slater executives, and Davidson students, decided not to
change the food service at Davidson drastically during the remainder of the present academic year.

The decision came after Scott had suggested that he would close Rusk House immediately to fight his existing revenue deficit
of $10,000.

“It’s a bite the bullet situation,” said Scott.

Scott had suggested Monday that he would be forced to resort to one of three alternatives if he were to
meet his budget for the 1974-75 school year.

He had suggested one of the following three proposals:

1.) An across the board 10 percent price increase on all food.

2.) An elimination of unlimited portions at Rusk House, with a simultaneous price range increase from 25 to 30 cents
a meal.

3.) An immediate closing of Rusk House as a dining facility.

Scott indicated that he favored the third proposal, the closing of Rusk House, as the best alternative.

“The expected savings for closing Rusk House are $700 a week. We would maintain the help that has been with
us the longest, but the more recent workers would be laid off. This would affect three people. The same plan
applies to student help. We would lay off two students,” Scott explained.

The duplication of facilities and labor in running three individual dining houses are the basis of Scott’s financial problems.

In addition, the all-you-can-eat plan at Rusk House, with costs estimated at one-and-one-half portions per person, has been operating at
a 90 percent food cost rather than the projected 50 percent.

“Bailey and Richards Houses are having to subsidize Rusk,” Scott said. “By offering longer hours at the other two houses,
we could accommodate the people who now eat at Rusk.”

Following college administration objection to Scott’s proposals and student disfavor, Scott abandoned his ideas for meeting his budget.

“After talking with my bosses at ARA, the college and students, we’ve decided not to do anything now.

“We'll continue as we are through this year and do the best we can to operate. We’ll just try to
come out ahead next year,” Scott said.
