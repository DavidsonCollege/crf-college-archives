Sports All That By JIM HAMILTON

Now that the Walker regime has moved in to take over this newspaper and consequently our friend, George Ramsey, has
moved up the ladder of success to associate editor, the editorship of this page has been turned over to yours
truly. But before you go, George, your readers and I just want to say that we’ll sure miss you and
all those letters home to your folks.

This column will continue last year's policy of giving the side lights on sports around the campus. Also this year
we want this space to be a sounding board for student opinion on the athletic life of the college. If
you have any legitimate, printable gripes about anything in the way of sports just send it in and we'll include
it, with your name, in this column.

Memos From Spring Tennis Trip

Members of the tennis team returned from Florida sufficiently impressed with their little mentor, Dick McKee. McKee, hearing that Bill
Talbert, former Davis Cup captain and four times national doubles champ, was playing at the exclusive Ponte Vedra Racquet Club,
promptly piled his boys into the cars and set off for Ponte Vedra. Upon arrival he walked up and slapped
his old friend, Billy, on the back, introduced him to the awed members of his squad, and then led his
dirty tee shirt and tennis short clad warriors through the rows of millionaires ready to watch the match to choice
seats on the spectator lawn.

Talbert, in a brief speech before the match, commented that the reason Australia is dominating the tennis world today is
because of the nationwide interest in the sport. In Sydney, Australia alone there are eleven thousand lighted courts, more than
all the lighted courts in the United States.

Odds And Ends

Congratulations to Semi Mintz on being the nation’s free-throw leader. Sports spectacle of the month is George Hart’s towering home
run against William and Mary that easily cleared the first row of trees behind the right field fence and is
believed to have joined the Explorer in orbit.

Brightest new spot on the tennis court is Greensboro’s Doug C... The lean freshman, nicknamed “The Greyhound” by Coach McKee,
is beginning to put fear in the hearts of the upperclassmen in the upper regions of the varsity tennis ladder.

A welcomed improvement on campus is Coach Whittle’s renovated track, complete with cement installments for the discus, shot put, broad
jump, high jump, and pole vault. However, plagued by a flood of injuries, Whittle is having trouble finding men to
use them. Ailing with varying amounts of severity are Frank Cenegy, Angus McBride, Graham George, John Huie, Marvin Bently, and
Al McKay.

The other spring sport, golf, also has a promising future with freshman Verner Stanley shaping into one of the finest
golfers to represent Davidson in years.

DAVIDSON NET CAPTAIN

Tom McCutchen is shown delivering his American twist serve that has helped him achieve a 7-1 record so far this
season.

The Lizard Leads Lethal Net Squad

Leading the Cat netters into the fray this season is their amiable captain, Tom McCutchen. Boasting a good forehand and
a slashing net game, Tom has been a mainstay in the Wildcat attack so far this year. Tom, a member
of Kappa Sigma social fraternity, hails from Florence, S.C., where he has won the town championship for the last two
years in a row. Before graduation from Florence High, he led the local netters at the number one slot. Currently,
Tom is holding down fourth position for the Cats, although he has played as high as number two. His season
record of seven wins and only one loss, a close three-set match against Toledo, is one of the best on
the squad.

DOUBLES BEST

Even though Tom is proficient in singles, it is probably in doubles where his main talents lie. Teaming with Harry
Broome, the duo alternate between one and two doubles, and have compiled an enviable 7-1 record. The only loss was
a tough three-setter in the Jacksonville Naval Base match, where Davidson suffered its only loss of the season.

Tom, nicknamed both Mickey (for his deep admiration of Mickey Mouse) and the Lizard (for his quickness on the court),
excels not only on the court but also in the academic realm where he holds a B-plus average. The Lizard
plans to enter med-school upon graduation from Davidson.

“We just made too many errors,” commentedThe Cats will journey to Greenville to engage Furman, and Friday they travel north
for a doubleheader with V.M.I. at Lexington.

N.C. State Friday

Fresh from a tough three-golfers will meet N.C. State. Scott is optimistic about his squad’s chances against State and commented
that it should be an easy win. In a 16½-10½ loss to Carolina last Monday, Verner Stanley was Davidson's top
man, carding a two-under-par 70 which was just nipped by a fine 69 scored by U.N.C. medalist Bill Thornton. Matches
with Duke yesterday and a return tilt with the Tarheels today made up a full week.

CONFERENCE CHAMPS?

Scott stated that his men, who have done well against rough ACC rivals, were a good bet to take the
Southern Conference championship. Davidson will face Wake Forest in a return engagement at Winston-Salem on Monday. The Demons beat the
Wildcats earlier this season.

Bi-Way Sports

Cats Fall To Furman

Hampered by their practice all season, Davidson’s cindermen were plagued with an all-afternoon rain when they fell to Furman here
in a close meet last Tuesday. The Purple Hurricane from Greenville edged out the Wildcats 66½-63½ by winning the final
relay. Only two points separated the teams up to the last event in a nip and tuck battle which saw
the Wildcats dominating the field events and Furman taking the edge on the track.

FIELD EVENTS

Dale Gramley, Stuart Nickles, and Dave Warden took top honors on the field, each taking one first place. Warden's toss
of 42 ft. earned a tie for first in the shot put. Nickles collected his first in the javelin and
Gramley won in the discus.

In the jumping events, the ‘Cats were led by Jim Bownes, Hugh Murray, and Chris Bremer. Murray and Bremer won
firsts in the broad jump and high hurdles, and Bownes tied with Bremer for first in the high jump. In
the two-mile race, Ray Antley paced the field with a winning time of 10:36.4 and was closely followed by Angus
McBride in second place. Brownie Thurman covered the single lap of the 440 in :54.2 seconds which was good for
a first.

In contrast to the poor weather of the Furman meet, Saturday afternoon produced some rare sunshine for a triangular contest
between Davidson, N.C. State, and Clemson.

TALENTED TIGERS

Both depth and talent were at the disposal of the Clemson Tigers who literally walked off with the win. Davidson
edged State for second place mainly on the strength of weight man Gramley, who handily won both the discus and
shot put.

For their last meet of the season, the Wildcat track squad travels to Lexington to face W. and L. Coach
Whittle is hoping his boys can bring their present two wins and four losses to a 3-4 record before the
Conference Meet.

Golfers Tangle With Miami's Unbeaten Netters

Invade Catland Tomorrow

Hurricane Match Ends Hectic Tennis Week

By “B” MILLNER

The Davidson netters face their toughest opponent of the season when they play powerful Miami University here tomorrow. Miami, the
perennial juggernaut of Southern scholastic tennis, is the finest team in the East and possibly the best in the nation.
Although loaded with strength all the way down the line, Miami lists as its top players two Davis Cup prospects,
Jerry Moss and Allen Quay, who alternate at the number one position.

The Floridians will be out to add another victory to their 29-game winning streak, and Coach Dick McKee doesn’t think
they will have much trouble. “We may win one or two matches at the most,” he said. “Their top three
men are almost unbeatable.” McKee added, however, that this contest was just what his team needed, and that it would
provide much-needed experience. “We're just coming into the part of our schedule where the boys have something to work for.
We’ve had a pretty easy time with teams like Wofford and Furman, and we need some hard matches.” He went
on to predict a “hard match” against Duke here this afternoon. The ‘Cats have not beaten Duke in five years.

Davidson enters its weekend activity riding a very creditable 7-1 record. They have lost only to the Jacksonville Naval Air
Station, a team composed of former college players. Although lacking a “sure-win” big man in the initial slot, the ‘Cats
accord their success to good overall power and depth. The probable line-up against Miami in the singles will be as
follows: No. 1—Dave Pearsall, No. 2—Semi Mintz, No. 3—John Poindexter, No. 4—Tom McCutchan, No. 5—Harry Broome, and either Doug Orr
or Dick Hodel playing number six. McKee lists his top doubles combination as Mintz-Poindexter, with Broome-McCutchan and Pearsall-Orr in the
second and third positions.

In two other matches this week, Davidson defeated Wofford yesterday and soundly walloped South Carolina 9-0 on Wednesday without the
loss of a set.

HENRY BROWN AND JIM ALEXANDER give hot pursuit to Furman’s Phillips in the mile Tuesday as the rains descended. Brown
managed to tie Phillips for first place.
