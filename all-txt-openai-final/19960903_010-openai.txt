#### Movie Review
**Not really a fan**
By Emily Simmons, Arts & Living Editor

When I got back from Germany in August, I was really looking forward to seeing all the movies I missed while I was away, plus all the hot summer flicks still playing. I was a little disappointed, though, when I found out that everything was just a rehash of all the old jingoistic action/adventure, stupid comedy, adult-becomes-kid crap that it always was (with of course two Disneys to choose from as well).

I thought that the one exception might be *The Fan* with the usually decent Robert DeNiro. Well, it wasn’t any good. I mean, how many times can DeNiro play the psycho-who-doesn’t-at-first-appear-to-be-psycho-but-really-is-psycho psycho? He just didn’t perform up to par, besides the fact that I heard that Wesley Snipes wanted to be the psycho and probably would have done a better job given the fact that once you’ve done something a few times it becomes blasé and clichéd.

Snipes plays baseball player Bobby Rayburn—a really good player making the big bucks who hits a slump—and Robert DeNiro is his die-hard fan who supports him through it all. DeNiro is a down-on-his-luck salesman who in the same day loses his job and the right to see his son after leaving the child at a baseball game. DeNiro also used to play baseball as a child, and it seems he is a bit bitter about never making the big leagues. DeNiro ends up in Snipes’ house with Snipes’ clothes on and then steals Snipes’ car and child. Of course, his son is the most important thing in the world to Snipes, so it’s a big ordeal, and of course, all DeNiro wants is for Snipes to hit a homerun FOR HIM—otherwise the kid’s dead. Pretty exciting so far, huh?

Well, of course, there’s a twist in the end where DeNiro proves his true psychoness and he gets terminated, and the kid lives, and justice prevails, and good old non-psycho American baseball wins. You know, DeNiro needs to get a new line and America needs to get a new deal. Seriously.

### A Fresh Perspective
**A first-year student assesses her orientation experience**
By Jenny Corke, Staff Writer

Freshman orientation has been a rather bittersweet experience. I have longed to leave home and go to college ever since I got into Davidson, and yet I cried when I actually did leave. I arrived here with expectations of freedom and a new beginning, and then realized that this combination can be somewhat overwhelming. I suppose it is easier to enjoy a major life change when it exists as only an abstract moment in the future, rather than right now and right here.

But aside from my own quickly diminishing feelings of uncertainty, I think that Freshman Orientation has been a very exciting welcome for the Class of 2000. From the Olympics to the Freshman Cake Race, we have had a whirlwind of fun activities. Some freshmen have admitted that they could really use a week of vacation after such a hectic week, while others have said that they are only ready for more adventure. One thing I think that we can probably all agree on, however, is that we have loved being treated like incoming royalty. The warmth of the reception from Davidson staff and upper-class students has truly been incredible. As my roommate says, “the people here make me feel right at home.”

At this point, it is hard to create a big picture out of what I have experienced so far. At first, I almost felt as though I was placed in a foreign land without a map, and told to find my way around, and to meet new people. People would introduce...themselves to me, and I would try to register their names and faces in my long-term memory, but eventually, my mind would become a jumble. Eventually, however, even this feeling of social disorganization began to improve. After several social events, including hall mixers, concerts, and ice skating, I finally feel as though I am in a familiar place with people that I can say "hi" to by name. What a relief! 

Right now, as I look forward to classes, to homework, and to various other aspects of college life, I still feel a little nervous. The initial butterflies have disappeared, but a fear of the unknown still remains. But then I suppose college is supposed to be a strengthening experience—a time to discover who you are and what you can achieve as an independent. The great writer Ralph Waldo Emerson once said that “What lies behind us and what lies before us are small matters compared to what lies within us.” Being a Freshman is all about discovering who you are and how you will develop when left to your own devices. And I guess it is also about realizing that there is a world beyond your hometown and outside of your comfort zone.

Getting loopy at Lupie’s Restaurant in Charlotte feeds hungry faces with success
By Dax Cross

On Friday after class, I returned home only to be whisked away to Charlotte to eat by three of my friends. As my stomach knotted up in the car, begging for food and emitting various and sundry grumbles and groans, I began to curse my decision to drive for half an hour before satisfying its craving. I, however, was on my way to Lupie’s, a trendy burger and chili joint to which I had never been. Therefore, I slowly cast away thoughts of the turmoil in my stomach and began to grow excited about the prospect of dining at a new restaurant outside of Davidson and Cornelius, two towns not revered for their cuisine.

I realized that Lupie’s was my kind of place at first sight. It is a small brick building with a mural painted on one wall and fancy wrought-iron burglar bars over its small and dusty windows. It resembled the typical unpublicized greasy spoon with little atmosphere but fantastic food. Upon entering the restaurant, I was surprised to note that my original assessment was way off base. This bar and grill had a nice laid-back atmosphere which was pleasant and comfortable yet not overbearing. The high ceilings and exposed ventilation (a popular style at many new and trendy restaurants) allowed for a spacious feel that often eludes small restaurants. This place was indeed much classier than a greasy spoon, but I could sense where its true roots were.

Our sweet tea came out to us in Po Folks style jars, which I took to be another good sign about the place. The menu was not expansive, but certainly would satisfy most customers. Lupie’s specialty is chili, served three styles, but the only one that called me was a spicy Texas chili, homemade with all the right ingredients. The burgers, too, looked appetizing, and Lupie’s also had a wide assortment of sandwiches, salads, and vegetables. The language of the menu led me to believe that I would not leave the place hungry.

After a large order of hot wings that lived up to their name, I quickly downed a couple of jars of tea which were promptly refilled by our server, who was efficient, professional, and ready to please us, even though she was currently attending to eight tables. All of us were impressed by the quality of the service as a whole. We were especially grateful when she brought out our food. As I stared at an enormous hamburger on a plate piled high with chips and accompanied by a heaping dish of mac and cheese, I knew that I would
