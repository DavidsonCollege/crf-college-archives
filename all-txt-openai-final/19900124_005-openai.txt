THE DAVIDSONIAN

Children of the malt, part II: Sampling some more unusual American brews
By JOHN HUTCHINSON

This week’s guest drinkers were Russell Snapp, assistant professor of history, Julie Gibert, visiting assistant professor of history and Humanities, and David Devereux, English historian and Gibert’s spouse. I extend many thanks to them for their input. I also thank Charles Houck, the Domino’s Pizza Guy, who wandered in off the streets and joined us halfway through the evening, and Michele Miller, campaign communications specialist in the College Relations office, who provided moral support.

After a long discussion about whether or not to use minuses when grading the beers, my guest drinkers and I got down to business.

**Dixie Beer (New Orleans, LA):** Standard, main-line beer with a little more body. Weak, tinny aftertaste. “I like it less the more I drink it” - Devereux and Snapp. “Tastes like it was cut with soda water” - Gibert.

**Anchor Steam (San Francisco, CA):** Heavy, acrid flavor smoothed out by the aftertaste. Would go well with heavier food that is not too hot. “Good beer to nurse along—definitely not a toss-it-down kind of beer” - Gibert.

**Genesee 12 Horse Ale:** No aftertaste whatsoever, no aesthetic qualities. Smells vaguely like a skunk or “a Patterson court party” - Gibert. “It is drinkable. You could sit around and get totally blasted on this. It was meant to be consumed in a large plastic cup.” - Devereux.

**Sun Valley (Helena, MT):** [This was Sun Valley’s special winter beer]. Smells like English ale. A good food beer not made for drinking in quantity. Made to sip, not gulp. Rich, smooth taste. “Wonderful beer” - Snapp. “Good for a drink and a chat with a friend.” - Gibert.

**Mickey’s Big Mouth Malt Liquor (LaCrosse, WI):** The smell makes you not want to drink it. No aesthetic qualities. “You can taste the sharpness of alcohol” - Snapp. “Smells like the really musty room in your house that you don’t want to open. I couldn’t drink any more than two tablespoons full.” - Gibert. “I’m upgrading this from an ‘F’ to a ‘D-’ on the off chance that there may be something worse” - Devereux.

**Anchor Liberty Ale (San Francisco, CA):** Taste begins as grapefruit and resolves itself into lead. Unpleasant, sweet smell. “I think this really is gross. It is the ‘F’ I was thinking of when I gave Mickey a ‘D-’” - Devereux. “If you like beer that tastes like grapefruit, buy this beer” - Houck. “Tastes like a beer that sat in a can for five years” - Hutchinson. “Oh my God. This is the beer that parents should give to their children when they are in 9th grade so they will think that all beer is bad” - Gibert.

**August Schell Weiss (New Ulm, MN):** Tastes like wine and smells like glue. “Grows on you” - Devereux. “I wouldn’t choose it, but it is drinkable. It would go well with cheese” - Snapp. “It would go better with fruit loops” - Houck. “If I want wine, I’m going to pay for wine, not beer” - Hutchinson.

**August Schell Pilsner (New Ulm, MN):** Yeasty smell, cloudy appearance. Descriptions of taste range from “smooth” to “sweet” to “sharp.” “As far as a good beer is concerned, it is ordinary” - Houck. “It tastes like bread.”

We judged the quality of 12 American brews over the evening. Another five, including Lone Star and Samuel Adams, remain refrigerated until the group can reconvene. To keep my guest drinkers on their toes during the blind tasting session, I threw in Mickey’s Big Mouth Malt Liquor, the worst malt liquor I have ever tasted.could find. They were not fooled. 

Significant Comments:

Maui Lager (Wailuku Maui, HI): Not heavily carbonated (note that it is not pasteurized), would go easily with food.

A (Rochester, NY): Not distinct, and I think it needs butter” - Gibert.

Augsburger Dark (Monroe, WI): Nice smell. No body, which is very disappointing, given the dark color. Very ordinary. Smoky, metallic taste. “Tastes like someone tried to convert a foundry into a brewery” - Houck.

St. Stan’s Alt: Amber (Modesto, CA): Smells like strawberry jello. Distinctive taste is there, but it goes away quickly. “Better than average by a little bit. The taste doesn’t grab me. It’s too bubbly, almost like champagne” - Snapp.

Anchor Steam Porter (San Francisco, CA): Chocolaty smell, tastes similar.

As I came out of the 7 p.m. show of Driving Miss Daisy, I noticed a jam-packed lobby with crowds of people streaming out the door. These 9 p.m. theater-goers all had the same look on their faces: “Is this movie worth waiting in line for an hour?” The answer to that question is a resounding “YES.”

Driving Miss Daisy is set in a wealthy suburb of Atlanta in the 1940s. “Miss Daisy” Werthan, played by Jessica Tandy, is a Jewish widow in her late sixties. She emerges from her huge red-brick home one summer morning and accidentally drives her car over her garden wall. The accident turns the neighborhood into a garden party. Her neighbors all turn out (complete with maids serving lemonade) to gossip and speculate about Miss Daisy’s driving ability. Miss Daisy’s son, Boolie, played by Dan Ackroyd, decides to hire a chauffeur to do her driving. Thus begins a battle royal between Hoke (Morgan Freeman), a black chauffeur, and the petulant and ever-stubborn Miss Daisy. The gentle ways and common sense of Hoke gradually win over the tart-tongued Daisy. The trust and sense of companionship that eventually springs up between the two characters sustains them through both good and bad times. They both experience discrimination due to their minority status, and this provides an unspoken but common bond between the two. Hoke and Miss Daisy are also bound together by the loss of Adela, Daisy’s maid. When Adela dies unexpectedly, both Hoke and Miss Daisy are confronted with their own mortality. The aging process then starts to diminish Miss Daisy’s mental capacities. Hoke helps to bring Miss Daisy back to reality, and he gives her the strength to continue her life. “Hoke,” she declares, “you are my best friend.”

Excellent supporting performances are given by both Dan Ackroyd as Boolie and Esther Rollins as Adela. However, center stage belongs to Morgan Freeman as Hoke and to Jessica Tandy as Miss Daisy. The chemistry between the cantankerous Daisy and the laid-back, optimistic Hoke is perfect. Both Freeman and Tandy manage to shine in their own roles without upstaging each other in the least. All of the actors and actresses in this film display credible Southern accents, and the Atlanta setting is rendered to perfection. The changing times which Hoke and Miss Daisy live through are reflected through small but important details such as old advertisements, vintage cars, newsreels, and radio programs. All these little touches lend an authentic flavor to the decades in which the story is played out.

Driving Miss Daisy originally began as an off-Broadway play. The play is still attracting large groups of theater buffs in New York. However, if you want to see the stage version of the play a little closer to home, Ovens Auditorium in Charlotte still has tickets available for its own production.
