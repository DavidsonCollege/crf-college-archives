Seminars Experiment in Liberal Education

Wednesday at 3:45 p.m. a group of students and faculty met for the last regular session of the “Interdepartmental Seminar.” During the past year this group has been meeting every other week in order to explore the possibility of tying together a liberal arts education more effectually. The basic assumption of the group was that Davidson provides a good set of basic courses, but that the student needs help in bringing all of this experience and material together into some sort of meaningful whole.

During the fall the focus of attention was upon the social sciences, set against the background of the humanities. In October psychology and sociology were used to answer the question: “What do the social sciences provide as a basic view of human nature?” In November economics and political science were used to “answer the question: What do the social sciences have to say about the present situation of modern man?” In December history and philosophy were brought in to begin asking the question: “In what ways is modern man coping with his situation?” Professors Bevan, McAfee, Ratliff, Morton, Marrotte, and Ford led the sessions in the fall.

During the spring the focus has been upon the humanities, set against the background of the social sciences. In the successive months of February, March, and April the question was asked: “How do literature, music, and liturgy and art contribute to a recovery of meaning for modern man?” Professors Bevan, Satterfield, Gehring, Houchens, and McAfee, together with Dr. Marshall Fisher, Dr. E. L. Stoffel, Dr. Samuel Newell, and other visitors, have led the spring sessions.

LaFar, Council Installed: No. 23 Anderson Cites Progress — New President Promises Quick Action on Projects

The final meeting of the 1955-56 Student Council was held on last Monday night. The final actions of the Council centered around the winding up of old business and the approval of a letter to the members of the Board of Trustees on the enrollment question.

Bill Bondurant gave the council a report on recent efforts to obtain an inter-semester break. He said that Mr. Hengeveld intimated that the Council should reconsider their most recent proposal which would have gained two days, one by shortening Christmas holidays and the other by rearranging the exam schedule. However, the matter will have to wait until the May meeting of the faculty. President Perrin Anderson said that, as he saw the problem, the only alternative was to extend school for an extra week if there is going to be any inter-semester holiday. A couple of Councilmen suggested the whole matter be dropped.

Extension of local telephone service from Charlotte was again discussed. Dan LaFar, next year's Student Body President, said that the petitions have been presented to the Southern Bell Telephone Company. He noted the tremendous amount of work that President Anderson and Mr. Broyles, of the Davidson Gazette, have contributed to the project.

A letter from Dr. Chalmers Davidson was presented to the Council. Dr. Davidson...stated that many books are being taken from the library without being checked out. He asked the Council for their advice in remedying this situation. The Council rejected the idea of a Student Council room check and suggested that the matter be left up to the library staff. A letter to the Trustees of the college was approved by the Council. The letter urged the Trustees to reconsider their recent decision to increase the enrollment of the college. Many facts and figures were presented which showed that the main problem facing the college was not to increase the size of the college, but rather to improve what already exists.

Nominations for the Athletic Council and for the Head Cheerleader were made by the Council. Bunny Perkinson then noted the fine work that Archie Joyner has done on the Election Board this Spring.

Fine Arts Festival Has Full Schedule

The Ninth Annual Fine Arts Festival continued through a full schedule at Davidson this past week. A concert of contemporary music sponsored by Gamma Kappa Chapter of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, national honorary music fraternity, was presented by the student-faculty orchestra in Chambers Auditorium last Monday evening. On Wednesday evening the Davidson College Chamber Orchestra, directed by Franklin West, Assistant Professor of Music at Davidson, presented a concert featuring solo pianist, Louise Nelson Pfohl. Prof. and Mrs. Howard Thomas have been presenting a series of lectures which began yesterday, including demonstrations, slides, and a film. At the program yesterday afternoon, the use of the gouache medium was demonstrated. Last night in the Blue Room, problems of painting were discussed, slides being used. Tonight in the ballroom, Prof. Thomas is to speak on the topic, “Enrichment Through Art,” and the film “From Renoir to Picasso” is to be shown.

Dan LaFar talks things over with his freshly inaugurated Student Council after taking over the reins of Student Government in Chapel ceremonies this morning. Not shown are Councilmen Bill.
