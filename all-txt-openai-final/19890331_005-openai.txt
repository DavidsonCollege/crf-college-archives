the village and makes for a lighthearted and funny two and a half hours.

*Wonderful Town* is one of the drama department’s biggest challenges ever, but director Alex Pinkston is confident he and his cast will pull off an outstanding performance. “It is a complicated integration of the arts,” says Pinkston, who is collaborating with the music department but doing the choreography himself. Organizing the music, choreography, costumes, and sets has been a big job.

The production requires an ensemble and an orchestra, both of which will be on stage with the actors. The scenes of Greenwich Village require ten scene changes. The show has 120 costumes for the 30 actors. Most costumes have been gathered from the area, but close to a third of them are being made by Katie Schiee. The ensemble is responsible for populating the village; most members change characters at least four times.

The score is not typical of Bernstein, said Pinkston, in that it is a variety of styles, not just jazz. The musical includes a Latin conga, ballads, traditional love songs, jazz, and some swing. “The differentiation in the score,” Pinkston said, “attracts a wider audience and provides a more interesting program.”

Nevertheless, Bernstein is always complicated and will be a challenge for the singers and the orchestra. For most of the orchestra, comments one member, this is a first experience with this kind of music.

Pinkston is very pleased with the cast. Most of the major roles are covered by experienced performers, but even the novices have come a long way. Donna Peters, Trina Janiec, and Mac Hardcastle have had experience on the Davidson stage and add a sense of professionalism invaluable to college drama. Sophomore Scott Spies plays the major male role in his first Davidson production.

It’s a special acting experience for Dipankar Mukherjee, an Indian student at the college who plays a Greek landlord. Mukherjee has directed and played in productions in India during his college and graduate years and has come to the United States seeking a degree in communications.

Mukherjee is currently directing an Indian play also to play April 24 and 25. He wants to direct in America. Mukherjee said his first play here and his first musical (*Wonderful Town*) has been “most educational.”

Alex Pinkston is a professional actor with experience in directing in Florida and California. His first musical was *West Side Story* at Lakeland High School in Florida. He directed *She Loves Me* and the symphonic drama *John Brown’s Body* at Florida’s School of the Arts. A symphonic drama includes dance, orchestra, chorus, acting, and reader’s theatre.

Pinkston originally aspired to be an actor, but he finds that he enjoys directing more. *Wonderful Town* is a difficult musical, but he feels that the work will more than pay off. “The happy mixture of music and storyline make this evening one to enjoy,” he said. “So ‘come along’ as the tour guide requests at the opening of the show, and experience life in Greenwich Village, New York, in 1935.”
