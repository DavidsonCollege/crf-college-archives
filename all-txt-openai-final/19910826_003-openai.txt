ROTC Awards Scholarships

By Tom Price

A record sixteen Davidson students have received merit scholarships from the United States Army. The scholarship will provide $12,000 per
year to be used for tuition, books, and other fees. Each recipient will also receive a personal expense stipend of
$100 per month.

Major Mike Hawkins noted, “Davidson students normally do quite well in the national competition for Army scholarships.” This year students
were particularly successful and Hawkins added, “There are more Army scholarship winners on campus this year than any year since
1919 when ROTC was established at Davidson College.”

The scholarships are awarded to outstanding students and are based solely on merit, without regard to financial need. The national
competition is open annually to high school seniors and college freshmen.

The nine freshman recipients of four-year scholarships were Benjamin Balsley, Joseph Beach, George Hiatt, Dennis Malcor, Jonathan Peters, Eric Rosenbach,
Telisha Ruddick, Thomas Shelburne, and Patrick White.

In addition, freshmen Eric Hall, Glen McClung, and Brian McGinnis received three-year advanced designee scholarships which will begin their sophomore
years.

Four sophomores also won scholarships. They are Jeffrey Crain, Jason Morris, William Pomeroy, and Richard Rivera.

Davidson students interested in applying for these Army merit scholarships can contact Major Mike Hawkins in the Department of Military
Studies. Major Hawkins can be reached at 896-2165 or 896-2336. His office is in Belk Hall, Room 2.
