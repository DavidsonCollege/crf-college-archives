---

THOUGH I MAY NOT BE THE DAUGHTER OF YOUR FLESH, I AM THE OFFSPRING OF YOUR EVIL.

MY MOTHER WAS VISITING DURING THAT NIGHT OF MOCK LOVE, AND SEDUCED BY AN EVIL, I WAS CONCEIVED.

WRISTS WHICH STILL LAY IN THE HOSPITAL.

AND I SWORE THAT I WOULD AVENGE HER USELESS DEATH.

I WAS BORN HUMAN, BUT A PART OF ME RETAINED THE ABILITY TO WIELD THE POWER OF MY DEMON FATHER. THE STRAIN OF BEARING EVEN A SPLINTER OF DEMONIC CHILD MY MOTHER HAD.

YOU ARE, TOO, AS YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN WITHOUT POWER. WEAK.

THE CERVICUS, WACEYRIS. YOUR WIFE'S POWER STEMS FROM HER. SHE HAS DISPATCHED ALEYTIS. ALEYTIS WILL HAVE NO MEMORY OF THIS. BUT MY MARK IS UPON HER. WHEN NEEDED.

DAVIDSONIAN / Friday 11 December 1981 | 19
