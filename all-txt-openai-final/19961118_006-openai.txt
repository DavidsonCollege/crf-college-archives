Other Campuses

EVANSTON, IL — A $20 bill now can cost $21, or even more. Six months ago, Cirrus and other automated-teller
machine owners lifted their ban on surcharging ATM customers, opening the door to extra costs for ATM users. Under the
new policy, banks still can charge ATM users for using someone else’s ATM. But ATM users now also may be
charged by the bank that owns the machine. That means ATM users can be charged twice by two different banks
for one transaction.

In a survey of 20 states released in October, the U.S. Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) disclosed that 23% of
the 458 ATMs surveyed already are assessing surcharges to non-account holders — just six months after the ban was lifted
on April 1. The machine must notify the user of the charge, which ranged from 25 cents to $3.90, but
averaged $1, according to the survey. In Illinois, only 11% of the machines assessed charges, the survey stated. But the
Illinois branch of the PIRG says that doesn’t mean some state residents aren’t losing money.

“If you’re going to one of those machines that charges all the time, then you’re getting charged 100% of the
time, not just 11% of the time,” said Gloria Beach of the PIRG’s Illinois branch.

At Northwestern University, First Chicago owns most of the ATMs on or near campus, including the ones in Norris University
Center, outside Allison Hall, in the Sports Pavilion and Aquatic Center, and in Burger King. Even students using ATM cards
from other financial institutions are not charged at these machines, as First Chicago has yet to begin levying a surcharge
for machine use.

“[Using a WildCard at ATMs] is much more convenient than my credit union at home as far as getting charged
goes,” said NU senior Jason Morris. “I must have lost at least $15 or $20 on charges at home.”

The banks that do charge are facing the wrath of consumer groups and national legislation to halt the practice of
surcharging. “It’s just greed,” U.S. PIRG representative Rick Trilsch said. “They’re saying, ‘We just want to line our pockets with
consumers’ money.’”

Sen. Alfonse D’Amato (R-NY) and other legislators have introduced bills to stop the practice, but Congress adjourned before any action
was taken. Until the government takes action, Ruth Susswein of Bankcard Holders of America said consumers, especially students, should take
action.

“Always try to use your bank’s ATM,” she said. “Also try to figure exactly how much [cash] you’re going to
need so you don’t have to keep going back.” The more you go back, the more the banks make. The
banking industry could generate an extra $847 million in revenue if 23% of ATMs assessed non-account holders a $1 fee,
according to PIRG calculations.

“Banks are not hurting,” Trilsch said. “Consumers are hurting. They’re paying $21 for a $20 bill.”

Chicago’s Cardinal Bernardin dies of cancer

Cardinal Joseph Bernardin died of pancreatic cancer last Thursday at the age of 68. Bernardin is known for having made
significant contributions to Chicago's Archdiocese. He was a native of Columbia, S.C., and moved to Chicago in 1982 after living
in Cincinnati for ten years. Bernardin was first diagnosed with cancer in June 1996. He focused on reconciling a divided
church and dared to broach formerly taboo topics in the church, such as the role of women and homosexuality. Bernardin’s
successor will be chosen by the Vatican.

Texas high school bars 15-year-old girl from cheerleading squad

A 15-year-old girl from Andrews, Texas, was informed by school officials that the school will not make exceptions to allow
her to participate in her high school's cheerleading squad, although she is wheelchair-bound. Callie Smartt was born with cerebral palsy.
Last year, Smartt was allowed to participate in the cheerleading program as an unofficial team member. However, this year school
officials cited safety reasons in their decision to bar students from participating in an unofficial capacity as Smartt had done.
Smartt’s mother has vowed to explore legal options in an attempt to reinstate her daughter on the squad.
