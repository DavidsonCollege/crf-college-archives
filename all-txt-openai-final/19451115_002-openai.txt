Courtesy Means Much...

In this new world in which we find ourselves adjusting to more progressive ways and thoughts and ideals, we yet find many old ideas and customs worthy of inclusion. The Atomic Age can only be the better era in which to live if it adapts some of the principles of the Age of Chivalry. In other words, no period of time can be a good period if it fails to uphold good fellowship, loyalty, and courtesy, for these things are the foundation of citizenship. And citizenship is the scale upon which we are weighed and judged.

The seed of these principles is sown in early childhood and grows through the school years. When a man reaches college he also reaches the period of testing and growth. To a large degree, it depends upon his fellow students as to whether or not his future harvest will be large or small—a success or a failure. Good fellowship develops rapidly at college and is a great force for good.

Because the spirit of comradeship is strong at Davidson College, the newly arrived student is received with a cordial greeting and is made to feel at home. He needs this feeling to combat the homesickness and loneliness that is sure to shadow his first few weeks away from home and to make him wonder if being a “man on his own” is worth the price. There is no snobbery at Davidson and no waiting around to be introduced to the new arrivals. No “rat” is a stranger to an old student. If he thought enough of Davidson College to enroll here, then he is a right guy and worth knowing, and no man passes him without an upflung hand and a “Hi ya, pal.” It is this friendly spirit and unfailing courtesy that makes a freshman feel that he isn’t a newcomer at all but a “Davidson gentleman” with all the loyalties and pride that the senior feels.

Every Davidson student accepts the responsibility of extending a welcome to incoming men, of showing them the fine principles of democracy upon which the college operates, of giving them the personal touch and individual contact so necessary for real comradeship. The finest school spirit in the world starts with courtesy and keeps growing. It is said of Harvard that they always keep the speech and manners of a gentleman. At Davidson, we always remember to be courteous. That is why Davidson College is noted for its good sportsmanship and exceptionally fine student body. It is a thing we can be proud of. Something we know is not synthetic, not an imitation, not a lot of high-sounding words. Davidson’s fraternal spirit, Davidson’s unfailing welcome, Davidson’s “one-for-all-ness,” respect for others, and natural courtesy, is not a bunch of editorial phrases. It’s a habit! It’s a good old Davidson custom.

Thanksgiving...

Yes, there seems to be more gulls around the big gray ships. The church steeples rise with greater pride to touch the heavens; the earth has a sweeter smell, and the fall leaves appear to have died with a little more hope and grace this blessed year. Even the weather has a brighter look... warm and pleasant, cold and miserable, there is still a touch of light in the sky that wind-blown clouds cannot obscure. The laughter of children rings truer, the turkey-day classic is better football, the turkey itself has a finer tang; and even the familiar scene of American homes is more still and peaceful than it has been for some time now.

THANKSGIVING, 1945. That's a lot to remember, much room for prayer, a great many to thank, all these, the dead with the white crosses marking endless glory; and the living, their eyes smiling, with a final place in the morning sun. We thank them all, the men who died, were wounded, lived, worked, fought, believed... always believed. And once again, with honest faith and clear hearts, that might perhaps have caught and doubted—once again we murmur thank you... thank you, thank you, God.

Thought for the Day...

One of the greatest temptations that young people of today face is the temptation to deny Christ. Not that we use his name in vain, tell unkind jokes about His work, or make fun of the people who are busy in this great enterprise. But figuratively we “hold the clothes” of those who do. Passively denying Christ is just as bad as actively denying Him, for he said: “Come out from among them and be ye separate.” Surely it is not asking much of us to say, “Yes, I am a Christian,” instead of saying, “I go to church and Sunday school because someone makes me.” “But he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels.”of God.” —Luke 12:9—

**Entrez Nous**

Now that the war is over, there are many things returning to the campus. For instance, fraternities are opening up. Some of them, closed because of the war, are now sweeping off the door mats and dusting the chairs and tables. The ending of the war has brought many new additions to the Davidson campus, and one of them is the introduction of a new fraternity. So far, it has only two brothers, the founders themselves, but it is busily gaining popularity among the student body. The founders, brother Joe and brother Flash, have been unorthodox in choosing a name by not using Greek letters. They simply call it the San-A-Nap-A-Pak Society and let it go at that. They won't say what it stands for—only members have the secret revealed to them. Because of the housing shortage, the Society has been forced to hold its meetings in the basement of West dormitory, but brother Flash told me the other day that they hoped to open a house in the court in the near future. Meanwhile, he said, “We are keeping our spirits up.”

A bunch of us were strutting down the street the other night in Charlotte, feeling all alone, when some very attractive girls came up and introduced themselves. One thing led to another and soon we were carrying on a very interesting conversation. They told us that they were opening a recreation hall on the order of the USO, only for civilians. That night happened to be the opening night and they invited us down for the celebration. Who were we to refuse? The house itself was a large structure and looked as if it belonged to a very prominent citizen—fifty years ago. The porch was all screened in and when we asked about the kind of illumination, they replied that the porch light burned out and all they could find in the way of lights were some colored ones. Over the door was a huge sign “Youth Center No. 69.” And then under it was another one, “Honk Horn for Curb Service.” We went inside and found many people already there, enjoying themselves. They explained the absence of the rugs as being useless when people would be dancing all the time. We danced to Clyde McCoy's version of “Turkey in the Straw” several times and by that time everyone was up to his neck in good spirits.

At that moment, I discovered that I was by myself with one of these girls. She probably noticed my quizzical expression, for she told me that the rest of them had gone for a drink of water. We conversed for several minutes, but I began to feel uncomfortable for the whole house was quiet except for an occasional squeaking of a mouse. I didn’t quite know what to say, so we danced a few more times to the record until we became exhausted. It was then I knew that she loved me and I likewise. I sat down on the sofa and patted the place next to me. She sat down gracefully and while licking the ends of a cigarette she had just rolled, she confessed her love for me. Ah yes, I think I shall never forget that rapturous moment as we sat there with locked pinkies, staring into each other's eyes. But, alas, as all good things do, that came to an end also. She told me that her mother wanted her to come home early and help with her business. We pledged our love for each other and I went on my way, leaving her standing under the porch light which formed a rosy halo about her. Oh, for the life of a vagabond.

**Poetry Corner**

I dreamed last night of joys I’ve never dreamed before,
Of dear and treasured memories I'll cherish evermore.
And though my dreams went swiftly and passed on all too fast,
They are precious joys and visions all come true at last.

I dreamed I saw a ship that was putting out to sea;
I dreamed the ship was strong enough to face whatever might be.
The ship was christened Davidson and it stood out from the rest,
The words Alenda Lux Ubi Orta Libertas stood bold upon her chest.

They hoisted up the colors, a pure red and black,
And the men—they worked together, a one united crew,
And their determined voices sang clear against the sky,
“We are the crew, the ship is you, Oh Davidson riding high.”

The pilot was their leader, he stood above the crowd
His eyes were so determined, his shouts rang firm and loud
He spoke with voice courageous, his every word their creed,
The crew stood in awe to follow the man they chose to lead.

The winds are our ideals and the challenge of the sea.
They urge us ever onward, a goal for you and me.
Their gale propels our Davidson and fills her mighty sails,
And guides us ever over the restless rough sea trails.

Our mast so firm and sturdy, the mainstay of our trip,
It represents our honor, the glory of our ship.
It towers toward the heaven, a solid invincible mast,
It guides us in the straightest course, though skies be overcast.

Though winds may lash our mast and threaten strongest sail,
Though dangers may befall us and faint-heartedness prevail,
Our words Alenda Lux Ubi Orta Libertas, so bold and ever fast,
“Let Learning be Cherished Where Liberty Has Arisen,” will bring us through at last.

—CHAUCER.

**Cookie’s Corn**

In the parlor, there were three,
He, the parlor lamp, and she.
Two is company no doubt,
And so the parlor lamp went out.

Mrs. Johnson opened her refrigerator door. To her surprise, she saw a rabbit inside.
“What are you doing there?” she asked.
“Isn't this a Westinghouse?” said the rabbit.
“Yes,” replied Mrs. J.
“Well, I’m just westing.”

Garage Mechanic: There’s a short circuit in your car battery.
Pat: Can you lengthen it while I wait?

Jack: Liz, will you marry me?
Liz: Have you seen my father?
Jack: Yes, but I still love you.
