Gas prices around Davidson are edging past one dollar a gallon according to a recent Davidson survey.

Prices range from 92.9 cents per gallon for regular at the 7-11 on the edge of Cornelius to 104 cents for premium at Archer’s Texaco.

Procedure provides for sanctions for honor code violations ranging from a warning to indefinite suspension. It can only be amended by the Student Conduct Council (SCC). Terry said he does plan to submit a proposal to SCC to codify the new policy.

Both Terry and McEwen said they were confident that the decision would not have negative effects such as making students reluctant to report violations or the Honor Council.

“The honor system becomes such a part of people around here.” McEwen also said that, since the Honor Council determines guilt or innocence independently of sanction, there would be “no impact on members’ ability to make an equitable decision.”

Though most station operators predict that prices will continue to rise in coming months, they say gas shortages are unlikely. An employee at Cashion’s Gulf station on Main Street said there had been no problems getting gas shipments for over two months. In fact, he said he could get a shipment within two days if needed.

The Dean of Students still has the authority to decide not to press charges if there is insufficient evidence of a violation. “We don’t want a ‘big brother-is-watching-you’ atmosphere,” Terry said.

“When there are open, unlocked rooms with wallets laying out in the open or in pants pockets on the bed, it is hard to prevent theft,” Bolding said.

“It is no great insult to the honor code to lock a door when there is no one around,” he added.

Bolding also asked students to “be aware of strangers on the halls. Ask someone what he needs if he looks like he doesn’t belong.”
