**Wildcats defeat Charleston, Citadel**

Ray Francis, Staff Writer

The Davidson men’s basketball team played some of their best ball of the season last week, knocking off the league-leading College of Charleston Cougars 86-71 on Thursday night (Blackout Belk) before fighting their way to a gritty overtime victory Saturday night against The Citadel. The Wildcats broke open a close second half against the Cougars by ending the game on an 18-4 run. The run was keyed by Will Archambault’s ’10 two-handed dunk on a backdoor cut that gave Davidson a 78-71 lead with three minutes remaining. Charleston did not score the rest of the way. Archambault added a three-pointer with 1:22 to play to make the score 82-71 and ice the victory. The dominating finish was a far cry from the effort produced by the Wildcats to begin the game. Charleston hit four of their first five three-pointers and jumped out to a 23-9 lead to begin the game. The Wildcats eventually settled down, though, and fought their way back to a 36-36 tie at halftime. See Wildcats, page 10.

**SGA Presidential debate sets stage for elections**

Caroline Woop, News Editor

On Monday night, students gathered in the Union to hear Student Government Association (SGA) Presidential candidates Rayna McKenzie ’11, Kayla McCann ’11, and Kevin Hubbard ’11 discuss their views and ambitions. Although only around 40 students attended the debate proper, the union was filled with students casually listening in, and the candidates’ performances during the debate reflected their established positions. The debate was moderated by Meikaela Zwieryznski ’10, current SGA President, and Brett Willis ’10, current Editor-in-Chief of The Davidsonian. The debate, which began with opening statements from each candidate, consisted of seven questions chosen by the moderators. Each candidate was allotted two minutes to respond to each question, after which the moderators asked questions submitted by the audience. The debate ended with closing statements from each candidate and a farewell from Zwieryznski.

The candidates used the opening statements as a platform to enumerate their intentions for a possible term as SGA president. Hubbard began by assuring students, “I want to bring improvements you can actually see.” He stated that these improvements might include providing CatCard payment options at Harris Teeter, installing water fountains at outdoor activity courts, replacing vacuum cleaners in dormitories, and encouraging more campus-wide events. McCann stressed campus relationships, saying, “I would like to facilitate greater interaction with faculty outside the classroom” in order “to make us more of a Davidson community.” She also mentioned the importance of improving campus facilities, especially creating more...Study spaces. McCann mentioned soliciting student input about curriculum changes and the need “to look at Activities Tax Council propositions closely so that we don’t feel like we’re wasting our money.” McCann concluded by stressing campus safety efforts, from emergency phones to icy sidewalks, on which she broke her own arm this week.

McKenzie departed from the other candidates in stating that she would not make empty promises to students, but that she would continue ongoing SGA initiatives, including the student website and the SGA Voices Project. “I am more concerned with what you, as a Davidson student, need,” she said.

The first question Willis posed springboarded off of January’s Winterfest. “What is your opinion of Davidson’s current drinking culture?” he asked, questioning candidates on how they would work to improve social life. McCann answered, “I do know these issues exist,” citing her membership in a Patterson Court organization. But, she said, “I think we’re all middle-of-the-hill people.” She suggested more campus events, including speakers and concerts. Recognizing the cost of more large-scale activities, she concluded, “We can continue to have big events, but also have smaller events.”

McKenzie emphasized the importance of deferring to student input, suggesting the creation of a “constituency-based group where senior senators do things for seniors.” Regarding student input, Hubbard stated, “I definitely think it’s feasible and we can create programs that will bring people together.”

The next question addressed the candidates' leadership styles, probing them on how they “plan to assert initiatives and agendas” to faculty, alumni, and decision-making boards. McKenzie again stressed

$10 million gift creates new scholars program

Friday afternoon at the Board of Trustees meeting, Tom Ross '72 delivered big news. Davidson trustee Carlos Alvarez and his wife Malu donated $10 million to Davidson to establish the Alvarez Scholars Program. Cited as a supplement to Davidson’s commitment to “global education,” the Alvarez Scholars program will provide financial support and scholarships to international students, akin to the groundbreaking Davidson Trust, announced in March 2007.

Alvarez was born in Mexico, but has lived in San Antonio, Texas since the ’80s, where he founded the Gambrinus Company in 1986, of which he is currently the President and CEO. Despite beginning as a small beer importer, the company has since grown to have branches and partners across the U.S., as well as in Italy. In addition, Corona Extra, whose sales and marketing fall under the command of Alvarez, is the top imported beer in the U.S.

Alvarez and his wife Malu were introduced to Davidson when their daughter, who graduated in 2002, was a student. While their daughter attended Davidson, the Alvarezes served on the Parents Council. The Alvarezes also have one niece who graduated from Davidson in 2007 and another who currently attends Davidson.

The Alvarezes have also been generous supporters of Davidson initiatives in the past. They are the donors of the student union, which was dedicated in their name in 2001, as well as supporters of various scholarships and renovations throughout the years. In 2003, Alvarez became a trustee, serving on the Admission and Financial Aid Committee. As part of this committee, Alvarez worked on creating the Davidson Trust, which ended the provision of loans in students’ financial aid packages, replacing them instead with grants. This move allowed the college to meet the full demonstrated financial needs of all
