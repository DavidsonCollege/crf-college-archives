Past her prime: Joni Mitchell's Turbulent Indigo
By Tom Bavis
Staff writer

Joni Mitchell's latest album, Turbulent Indigo, is a highly respectable but tiring set of songs. The relatively brief “Sunny Sunday” opens the album and reveals most of its secrets. Over a slow acoustic groove, a saxophone lets out an occasional flurry of notes as Joni begins a vague story of a lonely woman: “She pulls the shade, it’s just another sunny Sunday / She dodges the light like Blanche DuBois.” Noticeably worn from age and cigarettes, her voice still quivers beautifully. Despite the bright promise implicit in the title “Sunny Sunday,” most songs on Turbulent Indigo exude a chilling attitude of intense dread. Ostensibly speaking of the O.J. Simpson case, “Not to Blame” begins, “The story hit the news from coast to coast / They said you beat the girl you loved the most.” “The Sire of Sorrow (Job’s Sad Song),” the album’s final track, serves as a kind of anti-anthem. Joni reasserts the album’s heavy-minded themes of death and suffering while playing a complicated acoustic guitar rhythm. In the background, an icy keyboard sound drifts through the song like a winter breeze. Unlike most summations, “The Sire of Sorrow” does little to rouse the listener: “I’ve lost all taste for life / I’m all complaints.” Despite the bluntness of some of the lyrics, Joni cannot hide the fact that her heart is not into the music like it used to be. The instrumentation recalls but does not capture the experimental spirit of her late 70s albums. Though the lyrics display undeniable talent and thorough writing, one can tell they are forced. In a few songs, “How Do You Stop” among them, Joni subtly admits that she knows her best and most passionate work is behind her: “One day you’re too young / Then you’re in your prime / Then you’re looking back / At the hands of time.”

Debut from page 11
The two men in Heidi's life, Scoop and Peter, were played by freshmen Benjamin Summers and Ben Lukey, respectively. Summers, who was so radiant in The Learned Ladies, grew a beard and lost his radiance, but found a focus and personality that filled the void. Lukey joked his way through the script like an adorable puppy, searching admirably for some substance; he never found it.it, although he came close. His energy and his face were the pillars of the "Hello, New York" scene. Jennifer Neale, playing Heidi’s friend Susan, created the most interesting female character. Early in the play, Susan constantly talked about changing the system—she seemed to me a potential revolutionary. Yet, she accepted jobs within the “male power structure,” saying that once inside, she would change the system. She did not, of course, and after separating herself from society for a time, came to revel in the system she used to abhor. Neale played Susan honestly—as a woman who really didn’t know what she was doing, what she believed in, or who her friends were.

The supporting cast was exceptionally strong. As Fran, a foul-mouthed militant lesbian, Sarah Hankins was "f—ing" great. Carrie Van Deest played Lisa, Scoop’s unfortunate and spurned wife, with sweet naivete, but with an edge that made you suspect how wise she really was. Sarah Zogby was sexy and idealistic as Denise, although no one could ever believe Zogby and Van Deest were sisters. Kay Walraven hammed it up effectively as Jill, a women’s support group member, and Valerie Whitlock brought her nervous grace to two substantial roles. Another standout was Laura Seib who, with her saccharine flirtations and bubbly voice, added to the humor of the “Hello, New York” scene.

If I were to complain about anything in The Heidi Chronicles, it would be its inaccessibility. Wasserstein won a Pulitzer for her handling of late-80s angst among American adults, especially women, and now some of the play’s themes are outdated. This is almost the late 90s, and we have a whole new set of problems. However, the play contains a great deal that is universal. The script teaches that “all people deserve to fulfill their potential,” and that, as Scoop points out, “We are all awaiting the rebirth of wonder.” It is Scoop, in fact, who discovers what this play is really about. At his wedding, he tells Heidi that when you aim for a six and get a six, you can be secure. By the end of the play, he has changed, as they all have, and he says, “If you aim for a six and get a six, then that’s the ball game, so you might as well go for a ten.” By the look on Heidi’s face, you know she agrees.

Shafted - from page 10

avoids being preachy or condescending. It is not meant to be a social critique. The goals of the film are much broader than that. Director Steve James breathes new life into the old “follow your dreams” cliche. Hoop Dreams carries an unexpected and universal appeal. I found myself both frustrated and amazed by William Gates and Arthur Agee. In short, they are human. But I guess that’s why documentaries are not always artistically pleasing; real people don’t always make sense. I started wondering what my life would look like if someone made a documentary about it. Would people be able to sit through three hours of it? I don’t know. But by chronicling the lives of two ordinary boys grasping for greatness, Steve James reminds us that life, every life, is worth paying attention to.

William puts it this way: “Everybody always said, ‘Don’t forget about me when you get to the NBA.’ And I said, ‘But if I don’t make it to the NBA, are you going to forget about me?’” It is in the midst of the everyday dreariness of two kids, in the place where failure and hope intersect, that Hoop Dreams reveals a little of the mystery of what it means to be human, of what it means to be remembered.
