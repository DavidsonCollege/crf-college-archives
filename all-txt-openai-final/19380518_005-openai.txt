Sunday morning, May 15

Dr. Williamson, in dealing with his topic sketched briefly his own personal religious background. He showed how he was not born a Presbyterian, but is such by choice. There are two leading characteristics of Presbyterianism which influenced his choice, Dr. Williamson stated. These characteristics are: Presbyterianism’s strictly scriptural basis, and its ability to meet the acid test of experience. In connection with the latter, Dr. Williamson pointed out how the Presbyterian form of doctrine and government meets the tests of social, historical, psychological, and personal experience.

Taking care to clarify his position in regard to other churches, Dr. Williamson added that he does not hold that Presbyterianism is the only scriptural form of Christianity. He holds a tolerant view for all forms and recognizes that different types of persons are suited by different forms of government and worship.

The cardinal teaching is the depravity of human nature. Its natural characteristics are in direct opposition to the teachings of the Sermon on the Mount. The West Point is the need for a standard and a source of authority, which is neither too authoritarian nor too individualistic. This authority is the Bible.

The Good Life, under the law, is then contrasted with the More Perfect Life, under grace.

Enrollment Quota for Next Year Is Reached

Plans Discussed For Religious Activities During the Coming Year

Last Wednesday night, the new student cabinet held its first meeting, at which plans for next year were discussed. According to Sherrard Rice, new president, particular emphasis will be placed on the Department of Student Life in an effort to have active hall prayer group meetings on all the halls and to deepen the Christian life of the students.

An effort will be made to use as many positions as possible and to give jobs to every person who wants one. The Y next year will expand its work in deputations, colored work, boy work (Hi-Y and Boy Scouts), the student Sunday School, and social life. In addition to the concerted drive at Christmas, they will encourage tithing through the entire year.

Under a recent regulation of the faculty, new students must present credentials which rank them scholastically in the upper third of their class. Mr. Hengeveld stated, “To date, there are at present 650 students registered for next year. It will be possible to accept only about 200 new men. We will again have a waiting list, and vacancies will be filled as they occur.”
