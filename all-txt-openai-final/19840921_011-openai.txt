**Soccer Team 1-3-1 After Victory Over Pfeiffer**

By BOYD BLACKBURN

Davidson soccer scored their first goals of the season against Pfeiffer in a 4-0 victory on Wednesday after being shut
out against UNCC and USC-Spartanburg over the weekend. The Cats are off to their poorest start in recent history with
a 1-3-1 record. Coach Charley Slagle commented, “We would have liked to have another win, at least. But we’ve never
started a season with competition this tough. The teams we have lost to have a combined record of 14-2-1.”

In Saturday’s game, Davidson managed to hold UNCC scoreless through two tense overtimes to preserve a 0-0 tie. Throughout the
game, Davidson fans were treated to the exciting play of sophomore Steve Stith. Although he’s not starting, Slagle said, “Stith
is my first sub anywhere. He’s playing great these days.” He worked particularly well with senior midfielder Mike Lufkin, who
had one of two excellent scoring chances for Davidson this game. After some fancy footwork caught his defender off balance,
Lufkin hit a shot into the side netting from about 15 yards. Besides that shot, Davidson’s best chance came two
minutes into the game when junior Sean Austin battled his way past the sweeper and hit the ball by a
charging goalie.

In the first overtime, Davidson’s fullbacks seemed tired or just plain exasperated and UNCC forwards were frequently beating them to
create dangerous situations. Twice UNCC took open shots which could have easily gone in but sliced off goal. Davidson was
able to manage almost no offense of their own. The table turned for the second overtime as Davidson maintained considerable
pressure on the UNCC goal. A header by senior co-captain Jim Wright sailed high over the crossbar after the goalie
had misjudged a cross. It was simply another lost opportunity. The game ended in a 0-0 tie.

Sunday’s opponent was USC-Spartanburg who last year finished second in the nation in NAIA competition. This year they are ranked
number one in the South (NAIA). The small traveling squad was made up mostly of foreigners. For Davidson, the starting
lineup looked significantly different from the day before. Senior Steve Bernhardt and sophomore goalie Jim Kelly were injured and did
not play. Senior Mike Lufkin replaced Kelly, junior Wallis Goodman filled the midfielder role, and senior Mike Mauzé came in.

**Field Hockey: For Those**

By ANDY BARRON

While watching a recent field hockey game, I realized I was watching a sport I knew practically nothing about. Why
didn’t anyone check anybody? How come nobody just shoots forty-yard shots? And why were there so darn many whistles? I
asked my fellow spectators what was going on and got some great answers like “Your feet have to point toward
your own goal” and “You can’t raise your stick above your waist.” Nobody seemed to know any more than I
did. I decided that someone needed to find out exactly what the rules to this game were. So as to
benefit myself and the uninformed masses who attend field hockey games, I decided I would.

Coach Pat Daley invited me to scrimmage with the team so I could find out about the game. Pushed by
curiosity, and a demand from my editor, I entered the world of field hockey. The first thing I discovered was
that the sticks are really short and controlling the ball with this instrument is hard. I always seemed to hit
the ball too hard or too soft. Also, since playing the ball with any part of your body is illegal,
I couldn't just kick the ball around. I also discovered field hockey was like golf. As in golf, I always
either hit the top of the ball, resulting in a pitiful, bouncing pass or I took out about half a
foot of grass and missed the ball entirely. Now I know why nobody shoots slapshots.

Field hockey and soccer have many things in common. They both have the same offsides rule. As soccer has dangerous
play, field hockey has dangerous hits and dangerous sticks. The former occurs by hitting the ball higher than the waist
when other players are nearby and the latter happens when a player swings a stick at another player, as in
the follow-through on a slap shot. The cause of the great number of fouls is the infamous obstruction call. Obstruction
can occur in three ways. The most common way is for a player to place himself between the ball and
an opponent. It doesn’t matter which way the player’s feet are facing, but both players must have clean play on
the ball. This is why players try to place the ball behind an opponent so as to force the player
to turn around, thereby obstructing.

Davidson player fends off UNCC defender Saturday.to play center forward. Although the substitutes were made because of injuries, Slagle was
also looking for a new chemistry. The other forms of obstruction are not as common. One is third man obstruction.
This occurs when a player obstructs an opponent to allow a teammate to get the ball. The final form of
obstruction is stick obstruction. A player must play the ball, not an opponent’s stick. No stick-checking allowed. The final peculiarity
of field hockey is the free corner. This is similar to a corner kick in soccer except that while the
goal face is packed with players in soccer, a marked semi-circle in front of the goal is off-limits until the
ball is played. After the ball is played, a free-for-all of attackers attempting to shoot and defenders trying to get
the ball out occurs.

Rocky Kmeicik of Spartanburg scored late in the game on a confused play where a header in front of the
goal was lofted over Lufkin’s head and just inside the goal. Spartanburg now led 2-0. The Wildcats never threatened after
that. When asked if he foresaw the inability to score goals as a long-term problem, Slagle responded, “No, I don’t
think so. We've got the best scoring trio up front that we've ever had.” However, he conceded that “scorers are
a recruited athlete’s position” and that players who are proficient at it are going to be able to get the
scholarships that Davidson can’t offer.

At Pfeiffer on Wednesday, Davidson scored four times in the second half to run away with the game. In the
first half, the Cats had played “down to their opponent” as Slagle put it, meaning that although Davidson was by
far the stronger team, they hadn’t asserted themselves as they could. Goodman starred with three goals as he moved back
to center forward. Senior Tony Cabrales got the fourth on a penalty kick when sophomore Brian Shockley was taken down
in the box. According to Slagle, Shockley played an excellent game in his season debut after a serious knee operation
over the summer. This game exhibited the potential of Davidson’s offense. Davidson's next game is at N.C. State on Saturday.
State is currently ranked fourth in the South.

I found out Heather McKee has a heck of a shot and luckily lived to tell about it. My experience
taught me field hockey is a tough game that requires a great deal of skill to play well. The rules
are not difficult to understand, just hard to figure out for yourself. Yet now that the student body is armed
with passable knowledge of the rules, I'm sure it will be no time before field hockey referees meet the same
boisterous jeers of the fans that soccer and basketball referees have come to love when performing at Davidson.

Cats Defeat Catawba And Sewanee
By ANDY BARRON

Davidson’s field hockey team is learning fast. After being shut out in its first two games, the Cats responded with
consecutive wins over Catawba and the University of the South to even their record at 2-2. Before the Catawba game,
Davidson fell to 0-2 in a 5-0 loss to Duke. Duke put a tremendous amount of pressure on the defense
the entire game, thus preventing the Cats from mounting much of an attack. Davidson’s enthusiasm was not enough to counter
the experience and skill of the Duke team.

Davidson won its first game in impressive style by beating Catawba 5-1. The offense was led by freshman Janet Bitter’s
three-goal effort. The rest of the scoring was provided by sophomores Heather McKee and Shannon Stowe, who each contributed a
goal. “The Catawba game was just a solid team effort,” said coach Daley. “Our passing and catching improved and that
in turn made scoring goals easier.”

The day after beating Catawba, Davidson hosted the University of the South. The team was tired and it showed. However,
the Cats were able to survive several first-half scores and attack more frequently in the second half. The difference in
the game was junior Suzie Klineman. Klineman made a beautiful run of about 30 yards down the right side of
the field and followed the run with a superb shot that resulted in the game's only goal as Davidson was
able to shut out Sewanee. “The great thing about beating Sewanee was that the team didn’t panic late in the
game,” said coach Daley. “Our goal for the season is to improve with every game. After a great game like
the Catawba game, it’s really difficult to improve even a little bit in the next game, yet we did. The
new players are learning quickly and putting what they learn to good use. I'm really optimistic about the rest of
the season.”
