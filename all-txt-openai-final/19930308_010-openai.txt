**‘Cats Edge Marshall, Fall to UTC in Tournament Semis**

**Men’s Basketball Team Holds First Seeded Moccasins Until Last Moment**

By Bruce Balestier

During a roughly eight-minute span late in the second half of Davidson’s Southern Conference Tournament semifinal game with UT-Chattanooga Saturday, as the Wildcats all but erased a 16-point deficit, they began to seem like a team of destiny. The comeback began at the 8:52 mark, when Janko Narat hit a three-pointer to make it 55-42. Jason Zimmerman’s three-pointer with 5:17 left made it 59-52. Narat cut it to 68-63 with a basket in the paint, then to 68-66 with a three-pointer from the right baseline with 1:00 to play.

The Moccasins called timeout at :49, then naturally looked to point guard Tim Brooks, their leading scorer and the conference player of the year. His teammates cleared out and Brooks went one on one, guarded by freshman Jeff Anderson. Brooks drove to the right baseline and threw up an awkward shot with 19 seconds left, but Anderson was called for the foul on a controversial call. Brooks, who finished with 23 points and made all the big plays down the stretch, made both free throws to give the Mocs a 70-66 lead. Chris Alpert, attempting to find Zimmerman, threw the ball out of bounds on the ensuing possession. After UTC’s Gary Robb made one free throw, Brandon Williams’ tip-in at :04 made it 71-68. But the Mocs’ Chad Copeland made the second of two foul shots with :03 left to clinch the 72-68 victory.

**Indoor Track Ends with Confidence**

The men’s track and field team wound up its indoor campaign with several solid efforts at the Southern Conference Championships at VMI. Although Davidson could not improve on last year’s seven-point performance, the squad feels confident entering the outdoor season.

The most impressive effort of the weekend came from senior David Kerns, whose strong mile run of 4:29.4 ranks him fourth ever at Davidson. Tan Stewart ran a gutsy 9:02.1 in the 3000m run on Friday night. Stewart came back on Saturday to run a 5000m of 15:40.2 to become Davidson’s third fastest ever. Duncan Spears’ solid effort in the 400m was marred by a controversial wipe-out in the first turn. Spears was slowed by the mishap, but no disqualification followed and Spears failed to make the final with his 53.1 clocking. Peter Hurtado also failed in his effort to make the finals in the 800m run, although his 2:00.8 was the fourth fastest ever by a Davidson athlete. Lee Sutton fell short of breaking the school record he currently holds in the shot put with a put of 44' 8". Erik McMichael led the way for the Wildcats in the 4x800m relay with a strong 2:00.1 split. The squad of Spears, McMichael, Kerns, and Hurtado finished seventh. Also finishing seventh was the men’s 4x400m squad of Spears, Hurtado, Joe Beach, and Mike Grant.

Coach Andrew feels his team is poised for an outstanding outdoor season after the many near-records the squad posted this winter. The outdoor season begins in two weeks at UNC-Wilmington.

Hampered by injury and sickness, the women’s track and field team managed several fine performances at the Southern Conference Championships at VMI.

**IMAC Participants Engage in Playoffs**

By Robert Lloyd-Still

As the college basketball season winds down and teams prepare for the NCAA tournament, Davidson students have been participating in a tournament of their own. During the tournament, over thirty teams will battle for three elusive championships: A-League, B-League, and Women’s League.

The All-Stars, led by Mike Freeman and Chuck Brooks, will attempt to defend their A-League championship. The All-Stars, consisting of players from the BSC, had an extraordinary season. A repeat, however, will be awfully difficult. The All-Stars will face tough competition from Kappa Alpha and Kappa Sigma, both having former Davidson basketball players on their teams.

While the A-League showcases the best basketball that Davidson intramurals has to offer, over twenty-five teams will vie for the B-League championship. B-League participants deemphasize the winning aspect; most participate because they enjoy the camaraderie and exercise. There are four undefeated teams in B-League, and all have legitimate chances at winning. The early favorite would have to be Getting Stupid, which has looked tough all year with the dynamic inside-outside combo of Paul and Brett Hayford. A possible dark horse, however, is Lloyd’s Team which has come on strongly of late.

In the women’s league, The Fab Seniors would have to be the favorites.Favorites, because they went undefeated in the regular season. They are led by twin towers, Carla Davis and Jenny Wagner, who make up the bulk of their scoring. They will face some stiff competition, however, from the Old Women who finished the regular season at 5-1. 

UTC used a 16-2 run early in the first half to take a 20-8 lead before Davidson launched its first comeback of the game. Narat scored seven points in a span of 2:17 just before halftime, and the ‘Cats took a 27-26 lead on Anderson’s layup with 13 seconds left in the half. The Mocs led 28-27 at the half. But Chattanooga began the second half with a 15-0 run, as Davidson went scoreless for nearly five minutes, and took a 43-27 lead. The Moccasins (25-6), the number one seed in the tournament after a 16-2 regular season, advanced to meet East Tennessee State, winners of the last four SC Tournaments, in Sunday night’s final. 

“I’m extremely proud of what Davidson College accomplished this year,” Davidson coach Bob McKillop said. 

Freshman Hooff Helps Swimming Program
By Jimmy Jackson

With season’s end approaching, Davidson was looking for a strong performance in last weekend’s Southern States Swimming and Diving Championships at Davidson. Since the competition included mainstays such as Louisville, Washington & Lee, and College of Charleston, Davidson needed strong individual performances to inspire a strong weekend performance. That impetus was provided by newcomer Churchill Hooff. 

Hooff (pronounced “Huff”), a freshman, had proven through his season performances that he was capable of becoming, according to coach Ron Morrow, “one of the finest swimmers Davidson has known.” In fact, Hooff won around eighty percent of the events he swam, most commonly in the dual events, the 500 and 1000 freestyle. He seldom wins, however, in his favorite event, the 200-yard freestyle. 

“We have a lot of good young swimmers who like the 200, so I usually didn’t swim it. The longer events suit my swimming style better,” Hooff said. 

The Southern States was the peak of this year’s swimming and diving season. Hooff added, “We had primed ourselves for it. The dual meets were not that big. We were always thinking of the Southern States first.” 

Friday’s trials brought Hooff into position to attain the goals he set for himself at the season’s commencement: three medals in this tournament. Hooff’s quest began on Friday with good qualifying times in each of his events. He continued this ascendance with a victory in the 500 freestyle. In an exciting 500 freestyle final, the swimmer ahead of Hooff had a body length lead 200 yards into the race. Hooff employed his background of distance work to overtake his adversary in the last hundred yards. Hooff remembers, “I was dead and I thought he was, too. I managed to slip by him.” When all was finished, Hooff had set the Southern States record with 4:40.19. 

Though the 500 is Churchill’s strongest event, he came on strong in the 1650 freestyle as well. In a tight race with two other swimmers, Hooff managed second place while breaking the previous pool record. Later Hooff also teamed with Dan Ream, Dan Bahmiller, and Corey Bean for an impressive sixth place finish in the 4x50 freestyle. 

Perhaps the most impressive feat of Hooff’s weekend came in the 200 freestyle on Saturday. After qualifying a dismal seventh in the preliminary races, he overcame a bad initial performance with an exciting second place finish. With this rousing final, Hooff had added his third medal to his growing stockpile. His time of 1:43.39 was also his third personal best of the weekend. 

“Hooff’s impressive weekend is only a glimpse of what is to come for Davidson swimming. With our second recruiting class coming next year, we have a lot to look forward to,” said Coach Morrow. 

Hooff added, “Athletics at Davidson really seem to be on the rise. Based on how the soccer team did and the impressive basketball performances by freshmen, we have an exciting future. I hope that carries over to swimming and diving as well. Our team feels this is a good start.” 

Based on the leaps made by Hooff, strong performances by other freshmen such as Boler, Corey Beam, and a host of other talented swimmers, the future of Davidson aquatics seems to be one of the brightest in Davidson sports. 

“I still have a lot of improvement to go,” said Hooff. With that attitude, another recruiting class, and successes such as Churchill Hooff had last weekend, we can expect big things from Davidson swimming and diving in the future.
