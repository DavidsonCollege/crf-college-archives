"Two Suns" Leads Davidson Senior Alan Jones To Jazz Fame

By Andy Hackett
Senior Alan Jones, best known in a musical capacity as pianist in Davidson’s Jazz Ensemble, may soon become known to the Charlotte area jazz/new age radio audience as a top new talent, due to recent exposure of his original material on the airwaves of the contemporary jazz station WFAE.

Jones attended the North Carolina School of the Arts intending to concentrate on the cello, but fledgling interests in jazz and experimental electronic music led him back to the piano, his first instrument. Within a short time, he earned the spot as pianist in the school’s big band.

Jones’ further forays into the electronic arena continued when he arrived at Davidson. Early last year, an independent study in electronic music yielded the original pieces compiled as “Electric Journey,” his self-produced demo tape.

This past fall, Jones began correspondence with WFAE. Reproducing some of his songs on digital audio tape, he submitted his choice compositions to the station’s program directors.

Jones’ tenacity and good material has recently paid off; his piece entitled “Two Suns” has been selected to enter the regular rotation of the FAE program “Lights Out” (Sunday-Friday, 10 p.m. to 12 a.m.).

“Two Suns” imparts an extraterrestrial mood; Jones himself envisioned “cold, dark space between desolate planets...and out of the void, a piano enters and develops the theme.” His influence can be subtly detected in his work--the dramatic flair of Vangelis, the understated melodicisms of Pink Floyd’s Rick Wright, and the atmospheres of synthesist Kitaro are evident. Jones also cites keyboardist Lyle Mays and Peter Gabriel as influences.

Jones would like to pursue his musical interest in the future; and, given his ideas and experimental tendencies, he could one day offer something new to the musical scene. Jones concludes, “I think that, to be truly creative, one must be aware of today’s technology, yet transcend it and concentrate on one’s art.”
