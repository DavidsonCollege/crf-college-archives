be used for anyone except especially invited girl guests. The new ruling will not apply to any girl guests. The
clock will of course be synchronized with the clock in Chambers, and other wires will be extended for this purpose.
At night the clock will be illuminated—during certain hours. Thus light is controlled by a time switch.

Davidson Girl
Gaye Nimmons, who entered Davidson this year from Woodbury Forest Prep School, captured the lead from the second man, L.
P. Land, of Virginia Beach, Va., and crossed the final line several seconds ahead of his nearest rival, John Belk,
of Charlotte, who placed third. Approximately eighty freshmen covered the muddy course in a drizzling rain, competing for the prizes
donated by boarding houses and local merchants. The course was shortened about two-tenths of a mile because of the new
dormitory.

Omicron Delta Kappa, honorary leadership fraternity, held its first meeting of the year last Tuesday night at nine P.M. in
the Wranglers room. Gales McClintock, who was elected president of the local chapter last spring, presided. The meeting was held
for the purpose of re-organizing the fraternity for the activities of the coming year. A number of social functions were
contemplated, though no definite action was taken in this direction. Numerous other items of business were brought up for the
consideration of the members.

The present members of the organization were tapped by the retiring members at the close of last year. In their
ranks are to be found many of the most prominent leaders among the students on the campus. Other officers chosen
were: Reb Rummel, vice-president; Francis Magill, secretary; and Louis Hite, treasurer.

Harper Beall, Jr., was elected President of the Music Club at its first meeting of the new year in Chambers
building last Tuesday night. Business for this meeting consisted chiefly of the election of officers and matters relating to their
present place on the honorary Fraternity Council. Other officers of the Club were elected at this meeting.

Masquers Present One-Act Plays
Casts for the three one-act plays were announced by President Ken McIntyre of the Red and Black Masquers. The plays
are written by members of the college faculty. The production for these plays has been tentatively set for the middle
of October. Rehearsals began on Friday. They are being produced by Prof. E. J. Erwin, assisted by Ken McIntyre.

In “Veterans” by Prof. E. J. Erwin, the cast will be: Uncle Sid, Civil war veteran, Wallace Scherer; Lon, a
middle-aged farmer, Bill Summers; Plato, a Spanish war veteran, Dick Coppedge; Finley, a young soldier just home from the front
in the World War, Ed Taylor; Mary Belle, a country school teacher, Miss Polly Price. This play is directed by
David Colvine.

In “Uncle Tommy's Harem” by Galloway, the cast will be: Professor, a middle-aged college professor, J. G. Barnwell; Terry Withers;
Ed, the professor’s nephew, Frank Mebane; Agamemnon, a negro servant, Dean Crawford; Hal, a supposed wife from the harem of
a Turkish sultan, W. C. Plunkett. This play is directed by Harry Hendricks.

New Field Named
Davidson's new intramural field, built during the past summer, will be named in honor of Mr. William H. Sprunt of
Wilmington, N.C. As far back as 1903-04 Mr. Sprunt made liberal donations to Davidson College in order to provide for
its first real athletic field. This field originally occupied a part of the space that is now taken up by
Richardson Field and provided for football, baseball, and track events. It may be noted that the first baseball game was
played two years prior to the erection of this field.

In 1926 the Richardson brothers, H. S. Richardson, '06, and Lunsford Richardson, '14, became interested in Davidson and made plans
for a new athletic field together with a commodious concrete stadium for Davidson. Very soon the field came to occupy
the space that is now familiarly known as Freshman Field.

Now that the new intramural field has been completed, the administration deems it appropriate and opportune to christen it the
“William H. Sprunt Field” in appreciation of the early interest shown by Mr. Sprunt in providing so generously for physical
education at Davidson.

Claude Hackney Scores
Claude Hackney, Sophomore backfield star and President of the Sophomore Class, gained the singular honor of being the first Davidson
player to cross the Duke goal line in regular season play since the 1937 season. Hackney made this score in
Saturday’s game with Duke on Richardson Field on a long pass from Van Wilkins in the second quarter of the
game. Hackney also scored on State College by means of a similar pass one week previous to this game.

Benny Harrison, Judge of the Court of Control, has been very busy during the past few weeks in seeing that
members of the Freshman class obey the regulations set upon them by the upperclassmen. Many cases of “criminal conduct” have
been reported to him, and the court has recently seen fit to sentence four Freshmen to a strict campus. The
court meets once a week in the Eumenean Hall to consider such matters.

Dr. H. S. Agar
Dr. Herbert S. Agar, Ph.D., Litt.D., will deliver the second in this year’s lecture series on Monday evening, November fifth,
according to Dr. C. K. Brown, chairman of the lecture committee. Dr. Agar has not disclosed the topic of his
talk, but the address should be a very interesting one. Dr. Brown said:

Dr. Agar has been Associate Editor of the Louisville Courier-Journal since 1934, when he returned from his post as London
Correspondent for the same paper. His syndicated column “Time and Tide” appears in the Charlotte News and many papers throughout
the country.

Author
Dr. Agar has written six books, the most outstanding being The People’s Choice, which won the Pulitzer prize for American
history in 1933. The college library has this book, Land of the Free, and Who Owns America.

The first lecture of the year was delivered by Professor Edwin Mims, Ph.D., of Nashville, Tenn. This distinguished man of
letters was heard during the regular morning Chapel hour two weeks ago.
