Fragments of Heaviness

On Selwyn street sun drenched in rain,
Domed at dusk in yesterday's dream,
Gordian twined, I turned
Light-lorn in heavy cords of hope.
This is the role of heaviness:
To dredge up fossil fish
On bending chains.
From bottomless pools
Thick skin; time crusted—
Heaviness heaves its silent power,
Brooding out of wet millennia.

Things blotted leave no mere murmurs.

No muffled whispers echo in memory’s charnel house;
But Bacon's mouths triply crucified on Tate’s walls
Bloated round in screams and teeth,

Their tongues severed and wriggling.

Trade a Fistful

Trade a fistful of feces for all that you know and I will show you the
divine. Don’t just squat and pray; squat, crap, and then pray.
Glory on your holy stool!

If the dead were only an inch away, would they not make it with their
tongues? Hitler could not wait. He bid his mistress, “relieve
yourself, here darling, on my face.”

Oh, for a thousand shits I have risked my life and for a thousand more I will
die!

Come, let us hide in my closet. Close the door. See that shining slit?

What did Joyce see when in his closet he asked Nora to reveal her
‘brown, snaking thing?

The history of my people contains that we would defecate in the avenues
staring the passerby in the eye. Can I count the number of times a
long step saved me from disturbing one of these humble creations?

I grew up out of a pile of feces and the smell of urine on hot sidewalks.

Mating dogs were my neighbors.

I was led into the valley of the shadow of death and there I found the lamb
rotting ruthlessly!

Let the English woman beat me for insulting her queen. Let the American pass
by for ours is a culture of terror.

I will go to the gurgling child when the sulfurous smell does cause the
throat to wretch.
