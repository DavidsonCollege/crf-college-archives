**THE DAVIDSONIAN, SEPTEMBER 19, 1934**

**College Band Receives Federal Appropriation**

The musical organizations of Davidson will be greatly enlarged this year, especially the band whose enrollment has reached approximately seventy
pieces. The increase in this particular organization was made possible by the appropriation of one thousand dollars from the government
for the R.O.T.C. band and also by an additional appropriation from the college for new equipment.

**Summer School Shows Increase Of Students**

The Davidson College summer school, which opened June 11 and closed July 20, had 100 students enrolled. This is twenty
more than was enrolled at the same school last year. Of this enrollment, fifteen were teachers taking graduate work and
the rest were college students taking undergraduate work.

**Orientation:**

During the past week, the Y.M.C.A. has concentrated its efforts and activities toward helping the new men get settled and
started off in their new environment. Whether the new men realize it or not now, one of the greatest changes
in their lives is being made.

**Vesper Programs, Deputations, And Boys’ Work To Receive More Attention**

Pleasure at returning to Davidson and hope for a successful Y.M.C.A. program the coming year was expressed in an interview
today with A.B. McClure, Davidson’s new secretary of the “Y.” McClure’s personal statement follows:

“It is somewhat a strange feeling to come back to the campus and find that you know hardly any of
the men, but it is a great feeling to find that the Davidson spirit is still living on, cherished by
the men who are now here. We are expecting great things from every man and are seeking the cooperation of
each to make this a good year in the work of the ‘Y.’ Come by the office and let's talk
things over and get better acquainted.”

Stronger and more vesper programs, increased boys’ work, and more extensive deputations are the major objectives in the “Y” program.
The vesper committee, headed by Bob Smith, is attempting to bring speakers from a wider area this year. The music
department will be utilized to the fullest extent in an effort to make the services more effective. A league of
junior football teams is being planned and an assistant who will take care of the correspondence makes a wider range
of deputations possible.

McClure is not a newcomer to Davidson, having graduated here in 1931 after four years of a prominent campus life.
He stood high in his class in scholarship and was president of the Y.M.C.A. his senior year. The erection of
the mill chapel across the tracks is chiefly due to his efforts. He graduated from Union Seminary in 1934 and
takes the place of Sam S. Wiley, former secretary who enters Union Theological Seminary this fall.

**Dr. Arbuckle Victim Of Serious Heart Attack**

The student body will be very sorry to learn of the illness sustained by Doctor Howard B. Arbuckle, Professor of
Chemistry, during the summer. While at his summer home in West Virginia, he suffered a serious heart attack and was
very sick for more than two weeks. Later he was removed to the Charlotte Sanatorium for treatment. Dr. Arbuckle’s improvement
has been a great deal more rapid than was hoped for by his doctors, and he is expected home on
Tuesday. His condition was so much improved that he had planned to come back Monday the seventeenth but unfortunately he
exerted himself too heavily and was forced to forego his plans and rest for a day.

During the summer, Doctor and Mrs. Arbuckle made a two weeks’ trip through New England, visiting various spots of interest,
among which were Johns Hopkins University, which he had not visited since he received his degree there. It was just
after they returned that he had the heart attack; until that time he had been in the best of health.
The summer home of the Arbuckles is near Louisburg, West Virginia, only a short distance from the beautiful White Sulphur
Springs resort.

Since he first arrived at Davidson College, Doctor Arbuckle has been one of the outstanding members of the faculty, and
his absence is being felt deeply. Before coming to Davidson, he was professor of chemistry at Agnes Scott College for
some years, during which time he was instrumental in founding the Georgia Section of the American Chemical Society.Erecting Bleachers

In accordance with the traditions of Davidson College, the first-year men began work last Monday on the erection of the
bleachers to enlarge the seating capacity of the Richardson Memorial Stadium. Following a short talk by Montgomery, the “slave-driver,” the
freshman class responded willingly in spirit, if not in body. In this talk, Montgomery outlined the essential facts in connection
with the work to be done. To act as assistant, Dick Hayworth was appointed to help in the management of
the freshmen.

Peyton J. A. Kliemeier, ’32, and W. A. Mason, '31, passed the North Carolina state bar examination this summer. Joe
Tyack, '33, has been transferred to Petersburg, Virginia, where he is with the Brown-Williamson Tobacco Company.

Captain C. W. Seifert will be the Army officer in charge of the band this year and will help in
formation and drills. Warren Babcock, a graduate of the University of Michigan Music School, has been secured to give individual
instruction to the musicians in the band. The music department will offer credit for work taken this year. According to
Professor Pfohl, the members of the freshman class will be given some unusual musical talent, leading from the various high
schools and prep schools in the southeast.

Committee Adds Many New Books To Library

During the past summer, the library committee has purchased about one hundred and fifty new books and has had about
seventy bound volumes of magazines. The library committee is attempting to complete an exhaustive list of writings of and by
Woodrow Wilson so that this library might be available as a place for research on the subject. Some of the
more important books acquired are: “Matador,” by Marguerite Steen; “Years Are So Long,” by Lawrence; “Merchants of Death,” by H.
C. Engelbrecht and F. C. Hanighen; “Seven Famous Novels,” by H. G. Wells; “Holy Deadlock,” by A. P. Herbert; “The
Drama of Weather,” by Sir Napier Shaw; “The Architecture of the Universe,” by W. F. G. Swann.

Monday, September 10, members of the Y Cabinet, under the direction of Bob Coit, have been on the campus helping
freshmen become acquainted with the school and its activities in any way that they could. The pre-college Retreat also was
a great aid to the new men. However, may it clearly be understood by the freshmen that attendance at the
retreat does not raise their rating or standing in their class or in the school, nor does the man who
did not attend the retreat have his standing lowered on that account. There will be no distinction line drawn between
these two groups. We hope everyone will understand this fully.

VESPERS:

One of the most important activities of the Davidson Y is the Vesper service on Sunday evening. This is a
meeting BY the students and FOR the students, and we hope that all the students will take an interest in
the services and take an active part in them. The speakers are usually from nearby towns and are chosen because
of their special interest in students. Be sure and start that Vesper habit now!

DEPUTATIONS:

During each weekend, Davidson sends out a large number of deputations to nearby churches and Sunday schools. None were sent
out during the past weekend because of the rush and unsettledness of the opening of school. However, work along that
line will be started soon. Sid W. Marsh has charge of the deputations for this year, and we suggest that
the men try to do some of this work if possible. We also want to request the old men that
they co-operate and help Sid out whenever they are asked. If you are interested in this work, see Sid or
Albert McClure, and they will give you something to do.

W. M. Hart, “34, will teach French and German at Lewisburg College this year. Leon L. Corbett, '31, is now
practicing law in Burgaw. Fred Dickison, '33, will coach again at Lees-McRae College at Banner Elk.
