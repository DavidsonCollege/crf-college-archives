Series of Feeds Is Conducted by Y.M.C.A.

Freshmen Are Entertained Every Tuesday Night at Social Center

About one hundred and twenty-five freshmen have been entertained so far by the Y. M. C. A. at informal “feeds,” given in the Y. M. C. A. building. Some twenty or twenty-five first-year men have been entertained each Tuesday night for the past several weeks under the direction of “Duck” Powell and Sam Wiley, secretary of the Davidson “Y.” Remarkable success has been attained at these social gatherings in “breaking the ice” among freshmen and enlarging their circles of acquaintances. The “feeds” will be continued until all freshmen have been reached by the “Y” through this method.
