14 Wildcats dominate UNCG Spartans
By Setu Davis
Staff Writer

If the cliché “starting out on the right foot” ever applies, it applies to the Wildcats’ performance against UNCG last
Tuesday. The Wildcat volleyball team started their season of Southern Conference play against the Spartans of UNC-Greensboro on September 15th
at Belk Arena.

The starting six for the Wildcats’ home opener were senior Janet Duncan, junior Gina Lawrence, sophomores Mara Mordini and Brooke
Bentley, and freshmen Jennifer Ortega and Erica Schwartz. The Wildcats are a team of young, explosive talent that are already
enjoying success. Entering into the game against UNC-Greensboro, the Wildcats had a record of 5-3. The Spartans were 2-3 at
the start of play.

Brooke Bentley served to open the game. After the first point was scored, Bentley had a service ace to start
the Wildcats off with a 2-0 lead. The Spartans tied the game at 2-2 when a kill by Jennifer Ortega
brought the serve back to the Wildcats. The game progressed to 8-4 in favor of the Wildcats. The team was
playing well and starting off their first game in conference play positively. The Spartans responded and tightened the gap at
8-7. UNCG briefly took the lead at 9-8. A kill by Mara Mordini regained the serve for the Wildcats, and
from then on, the Spartans would not score again. Another kill by Mordini after a serve by sophomore Katherine Lorenz
ended the first game at 15-9.

After being tied at 7-7, the Wildcats began to pull away after senior Sarah Covell entered the game. Five unanswered
points moved the Wildcats into the lead at 12-7 when the Spartans regained the serve and scored two straight. The
Spartans would get no closer. On the strength of the play of Jennifer Ortega and Mara Mordini, the Wildcats closed
out the second game at 15-9. The good start that they accomplished in game one was now carrying them through
to victory.

The Wildcats scored six straight points to open the final game. The Spartans put up a tough fight, but miscommunications
and botched plays hurt them the entire game. The Wildcats did not ease the pressure even when the score closed
to 9-7. After regaining serve, the Wildcats scored once. The Spartans closed the gap again to 10-9, but could not
tie the game. The Wildcats closed out the match at 15-9. Three straight 15-9 games told the story of the
Southern Conference opener for the Wildcats. Underlying the score was the fact that, as Head Coach Lisa Marston said, the
Wildcats “did what they had to do (to win).” Coach Marston was also happy with the depth displayed by the
team, as she was able to use a rotation of ten different players in the victory.

Setter Erica Schwartz led the team with 41 assists while Mara Mordini had 15 kills to lead the offense. Jennifer
Ortega played a sharp game and had 11 kills. Defensively, the star was Brooke Bentley, who had twelve digs in
the game.
