PRESIDENT, from page 15

Student body on the condom question, the Senate has voted to hold a referendum on Tuesday, April 4 in conjunction
with elections for class senators. Students can vote in the referendum on the first floor of Chambers in front of
the Gallery or in the Conversation Pit of the College Union. Polls will be open from 9:00 to 3:00.

The referendum was carefully worded by representatives from the Human Resources Committee, the Student Health Options and Concerns Committee, the
Union, and the Senate. It reads, “Should Davidson College provide direct access to condoms for Davidson students? (Yes or No).”
We did not specify the means of access, because that would cloud the issue. Some students are for the availability
of condoms, but against machines or first aid boxes or one of the other choices. If the “Yes” votes win,
then representatives from the SGA, HRC, SHOC, Union, and other members of the student body will meet to discuss the
options and choose one that most students on campus will be comfortable with. The success and the validity of this
effort depend on your involvement. The Senate urges you to vote in the referendum on Tuesday so that true student
opinion will be represented in the results. We want to know what you think about this controversial question; please contact
me, Tim Sparks, vice president, or your SGA senator if you have any comments or suggestions. Remember to vote on
Tuesday, Apr 4!

Tripp Helms
SGA President

CONDOMS, from page 15

Would definitely affect them. “I’d wonder about the type of students that went to Davidson,” one said. Another was unable
to put her exact feelings into words, but stated that the sight would undoubtedly make an impact on her. Those
who criticized Boyd Miller and Paul Renner’s commentaries may have been able to find some fault with their statistics, but
it was impossible for these writers to deny the moral impact the condom machines will have on the Davidson campus.
Just because students “choose to sin” by engaging in sexual relations outside of marriage, the college is not obligated to
help them “sin safely.” The opposition to the machines is not merely “inveterate Bible-pounding pontification,” but adherence to God’s own
laws which Davidson College supposedly still champions and claims to follow.

Sincerely,
Debbie deSola

ADMISSIONS, from page 15

Unsubstantiated data are not very constructive. The problems we face are not due to a lack of commitment, and they
are not going to be solved by pointing fingers. The recruitment/enrollment of minorities in higher education is a national disgrace,
and those of us responsible for this function at Davidson welcome the efforts of anyone who would like to pitch
in and make things better.

Sincerely,
Robert E. Gardner
