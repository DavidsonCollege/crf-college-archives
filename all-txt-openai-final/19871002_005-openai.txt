**Pop Film “On a Mission from God”: The Blues Brothers**

By TIM JACKS

Action! Laughter! Music! Drama! Sideburns! Hand me that black hat and give me those black shades! “The Blues Brothers” plays
tonight in the 900 Room at 8:30. This classic musical-comedy starring Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi is just the movie
to get the weekend rockin’ and rollin’. John Landis directed this epic tale of the infamous Jake and Elwood Blues.

The action starts when Jake (Belushi) gets out of jail. It turns out he stole some money to cover the
band’s last room service bill. Jake and Elwood (Aykroyd) immediately go to see their friend, The Penguin, a nun who
needs $5,000 to cover taxes on her children’s home. Of course, our honorable heroes offer their services to raise the
money. The only problem is, it has to be done legally. But in a flash of blazing light from above
during the Triple Rock Baptist Church Sunday morning service, Jake finds the answer: the brothers will get the band back
together and earn the money.

So Jake and Elwood start on their holy quest to find all of their old R&B band members. (The infamous
line appeareth: “we're on a mission from God.”) Despite many trials and tribulations, including the mystery woman, the Illinois Nazis,
the Good Ol’ Boys, and the Chicago Police, all of whom want to kill the Blues Brothers (or at least
hurt them a lot), they succeed in re-forming their band. They’ve even gotten the gig to raise the money. But
will they make it to the show on time? Check it out and see, for the low, low price of
99 cents.

This is a star-filled movie that’s really worth seeing, if only for the outstanding performances by James Brown, Aretha Franklin,
Ray Charles, and Cab Calloway as well as the Blues Brothers. But wait, there’s more! You’ll also see Carrie Fisher,
John Candy, and Twiggy. And for five points each, see if you can find John Landis, Steven Spielberg, Frank Oz,
Chaka Khan, and Pee Wee Herman in their cameo roles!

“The Blues Brothers” is rated R for language (sorry, no nudity) and lasts a little over 2 hours. Even if
you’ve seen it before, come on, you have to see the shopping mall get trashed by the Bluesmobile again. Come
in time to see the Looney Tunes beforehand ... and remember to bring your I.D.

"It's 106 miles to Chicago. We’ve got a full tank of gas, half a pack of cigarettes, it’s dark, and
we’re wearing sunglasses.”

“Hit it.”

**R.I.P. Booze Brothers, Hello, MacLads**

By GLENN FOGLE

Every so often major tragedies strike that leave a long-lasting social impact and instill sadness and frustration in the hearts
of the world. Such losses, though grievous, remind us of the true frailty of the human existence, and yet serve
to underscore the strength of the human spirit. Such a tragedy has befallen the Davidson community.

It is with deep sorrow and regret that we announce the unfortunate and untimely deaths of two of the college
community’s most beloved members, the Booze Brothers.

On the afternoon of Wednesday, September 23, 1987, the recently born-again Booze Brothers were en route with several of their
newly-found KA friends to a dual lecture in the 900 Room entitled “Christianity and the Art of RV Maintenance” and
“Guilt Without Sex — Sex and the Single Sixth Grader” when they spied an elderly woman struggling across Main Street
with the grocery bags she was carrying home from the soon-to-be-defunct Food Lion. Racing across the street to help the
old bag (whoops!) the old woman with her bags, they were blinded by the immensely bright glare of the sun
reflected off fellow pedestrian Dean Terry’s head.

In the midst of their confusion, they were struck down by a carload of Queenies speeding to elude four carloads
of horny Hoddies (or was it Captain Pikedog and his army of Weenies pursuing the Queenies? Actually, we heard it
was the whole damn SPE fraternity looking for some women to come to their house, but maybe it was just
a couple of Phi Delts.) In any event, the car got away and the tragic damage had been done.

In a sudden flash of quick-thinking, Terry rushed the limp, mutilated figures of the Booze Brothers to “Haven’t Got a
Prayer” Infirmary, but alas, the Booze Brothers were dead. God had called them back home.

The Booze Brothers served this school in the most effective way they knew — through the media. Never ones to
succumb to the temptation of sensationalism or potentially yellow journalism to get attention, the Booze Brothers offered us all an
(only slightly) exaggerated, satiric, and moreover tongue-in-cheek look at ourselves. But even by the same token, the Booze Brothers hoped
that their readers would be compelled to search deep within their souls, to explore their own true feelings and further
the distinction between themselves and the rest of the very special individuals that constitute this school, this community, this great
nation, this world, this solar system, and all other fragments of solid waste floating around in the great vacuum of
space.

On behalf of the families of the Booze Brothers, many thanks for the cards, letters, kitchen appliances, and Chinese domestic
discipline implements. A memorial service will be held at Queens College on Sadie Hawkins Day (donations will be accepted.)

— The MacLads

The MacLads have been asked to take the place of the passed away again Booze Brothers. We did manage to
recover a bloodstained fragment of the interview with the Pope.John Paul II from the mangled body of one of the
Booze Brothers...

B.B.: Well, Pontiff, what exactly do you think of the Sesquicentennial Edition of Quips & Cranks?

His Holiness: [flipping through said volume] Frankly, on behalf of the Roman Catholic Church, [turning various shades of red] I’m
embarrassed. (The next few lines are illegible because of bloodstains.)

B.B.: You mean... that it’s worse than being shot? (more bloodstains)

Editor and (bloodstain) 3,986,465 332,012,345 years in Purga(bloodstain) Oct. 13, 3:49 am. (bloodstains).

Question of the Week: “Should this column be taken seriously?”
A: No.
B: Never.
C: Nope.
D: Only by “reactionary xenophobic enclaves of superficial conformist little snobs.” (from “Life in Hell.” Check your back issues.)
E: All of the above.

Lecture Time: Honor Code violations are no spoof
By BILL SCOUTEN

“Hey, Jim, have you seen my knapsack?”

“No, what’s up?”

“Well, I thought I left it in one of the carrels down in the basement of the library. You know,
my carrel. I just don’t understand. I’m positive I left it there last night.”

“Maybe you left it in another carrel. Let’s check. There aren’t that many carrels in the basement. C’mon, let’s go.”

“I thought that it would be safe overnight. I asked around, and someone said that they had seen it this
morning, but when I was about to go to class at 10:00, it was gone. I’ve got to find it.
It’s just too important to lose... it’s got all my supplies in it!”

Usually, the carrel would be arranged with textbooks and library books stacked on the top shelf, supplies stored next to
the books. But today the scene is different. The carrel is as always, in its place, but the articles adorning
its surfaces are rearranged or missing. First, you think, “Am I at my carrel?” Yes, you are; the library books
and remaining textbooks are yours. But, where is the day pack you left on the carrel? Where are the pens
and pencils? What's the deal?

Alarmed and riled, the next step in your search centers around the other hundreds of carrels in the library. Checking
each one personally, you remember a prank that a friend once pulled in high school. You know the one of
which I speak; your best friend, the one with whom you shared your darkest secrets (and your locker combination), arranged
for your locker to be emptied completely of its contents. The morning after the deed — panic, utter hysteria, as
you’re left with a pencil and a locker full of popcorn. The prank was successful. This is the real thing,
a well-planned spoof. However, this is something different.

Upon speaking to friends, all tributaries turn up dry. There are no leads. No one has pulled a prank. The
library has no knowledge of missing books and supplies — at least none were found. You are now distraught, highly
enraged, and worried. This is critical. What can you do?

Three days later, on one of those daily library reconnaissance missions for missing paraphernalia, the day pack is discovered... open,
in a carrel far away from the rest in an isolated corner of the library. The contents are strewn on
the workspace of the tabletop. A calculator is gone, a pen is missing, an “ideal” is shattered.

An “ideal” is shattered in your mind, the ideal that may have influenced you in your choice of Davidson as
a college. This happening, the disappearance of a day pack full of personal belongings or the disappearance of a bike,
seemingly a prank, is far from spoof material. In fact, this is a serious matter, to be dealt with immediately.
Stealing, euphemistically known as “borrowing indefinitely,” is not a spoof, nor should it be considered by anyone to be one.
In such a community as Davidson, stealing should not be tolerated.

“Stealing” does not apply just to school supplies, though. It applies to anything that does not belong specifically to you.
(Yes, that includes bikes! Surprised?!&%z,$!) Tampering with others’ possessions is not only an incrimination of oneself but also infringes on
the rights of other students.

The honor system was designed by the students and is for the students, existing to promote a sense of trust
and respect in the community. Indeed, many students are hard at work trying to keep the honor code tradition working,
trying to keep the prospective and current students’ perception of Davidson College’s honor system alive. This is the Davidson I
visited as a sophomore in high school; the Davidson where a coat and a stack of books, perhaps a day
pack, could be left overnight in the Commons and remain untouched. No, the honor of Davidson is not a system
to be worked around, but a personal commitment to the community. This is the Davidson that we, the students, must
propagate. The honor of this establishment rests not on the administration, but on us. The key to the honor system,
then, is consideration for other people. Therefore, instead of thinking “honor code, schmonor code!” to ourselves, why don’t we all
exercise our responsibility?

It’s a given that Davidson will never be perfect, but there is a sense of community in Davidson, a diverse
student body living together in the virtues of honesty, diligence, and love. Let’s support the tradition of excellence in education...
don’t make a spoof out of our ideal. It means, and has meant, something special to so many... won’t you
believe also?
