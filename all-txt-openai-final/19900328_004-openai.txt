Environmental Tip of the Week

Intelligible, sensible, do-able, and slightly inconvenient ideas for the Davidson College Student:

Have you ever looked in a Chambers trash can? If you have, you probably saw a pile of recyclable beverage containers. We drink enough O.J. and caffeinated drinks to accumulate large numbers of containers after just 2 to 3 class periods. By the end of the day, we’ve produced much more. Hey, don’t waste these containers any longer! Recycle them! Instead of throwing that can, glass bottle, or plastic container into a Chambers trash can, carry it to a campus recycling center and deposit it. These centers are found in each residence hall and in the Union. It is not heavy, and if you drink all of the container’s contents, it is not too messy to carry in your bag or pocket. Think about it, then do it—in Chambers, and other buildings as well!

You may ask why recycling containers are not in Chambers? Well, containers would need monitoring daily, and at present, the recycling committee does not have the manpower required for this operation.
