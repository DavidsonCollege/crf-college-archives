Music News By Frank Barr, Jr.
The members of Phi Mu Alpha held initiation for three new members on March 13. The new members are James Nisbet, Middy Raynal, and Guy Hitchcock. Plans have been completed for the opening of Phi Hall each day for the benefit of students who have spare time and would like to spend it listening to records. Phi Hall will be open from five to six-thirty each afternoon. On Saturday and Sunday, the hall will be available most of the afternoon. If you have free time on either Monday, Wednesday, or Friday night, Phi Hall will be open for you at that time until nine-thirty. Let me urge everyone to take advantage of the good selection of recordings at our disposal.

The Davidson Symphonic Band gave a concert in Chambers Auditorium on March 19. This was the first formal appearance of the band on campus this semester. The members of the band will spend the day of March 23 at Converse College in Spartanburg, S.C. They will give a concert that night as the closing performance in the Converse Spring Music Festival. More important to the members themselves is the fact that the girls have arranged for a dance after the concert.

Much of the talk among students this week has been of the concerts to be presented by Alec Templeton, blind pianist. He will appear in Charlotte and Concord later this month. At present, some tickets are still available. Trips are being arranged for both the Band and the Glee Club this semester. Plans are incomplete at present. It will be nice to see these organizations back on a normal footing.

FIGURE THIS OUT
Three Phi Betas walk into a blacked-out room in which there are three white hats and two black hats. Each takes a hat, puts it on, and walks out, one behind the other. Neither one of the three looks around, seeing only the one or ones in front of him. The rear man says he doesn’t know what color his hat is; the middle man makes the same statement; and the first man says that he knows the color of his hat. What is the color of his hat and how did he arrive at the solution? There are no tricks involved.
