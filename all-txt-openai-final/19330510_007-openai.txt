WILDCAT TRACKMEN LOSE TO DUKE FOR FIRST DEFEAT OF SEASON

THE SPORTS PARADE

‘CAT NINE BREAKS HAMPDEN-SYDNEY’S WINNING STREAK

RA CASKIE NORVELL

Ole Man Jupe Pluvius again interfered with the Davidson-Wake Forest imbroglio. It looks as if the game will have to be definitely set aside, and only one contest, that in the Deacons’ backyard, will be played between the two Big Five favorites. The game will have a decided bearing on the championship. Junie Barnes will undoubtedly be the D hurling choice, and either Charlie Harris or Lefty Pearce should get the call to fling them over for Coach Laird’s boys.

The nine got into a hotbed of trouble when they tried to spank V. P. I.’s Gobblers. Jule West held the Techmen to four bingles in the second encounter, while his mates were garnering six, but even so the Virginia team came out on top, 4 to 1. Hampden-Sydney’s string of eight consecutive victories was definitely nipped in the bud when the ’Cats won an overtime thriller in Death Valley, 3 to 2.

Feeble play in the field, and poor base running served to completely rout the freshman nine on its eastern invasion last week. Louisburg, Carolina, and State were met on the trip, and the co-eds at the first mentioned school proved very popular with the freshman aggregation. Take a tip from ye ed, it was a swell place.

Davidson's track team met their initial defeat, losing to the strong Duke team. Cochran, with an injury, tied his college record in the shotput to win this event. Johnny Brownlee, Blue Devil flash, took first in the furlong and the low hurdles, beating Fleagle, Davidson speedster, in the former. The Devils swept the 800-yard run, and the ’Cats finished one, two, three in the high hurdles, McCallie, McPhail, and Pratt finishing in the order named.

Carolina upset the dope, and defeated the illustrious Peck Luck, to bump the Cavaliers in their annual diamond classic in Greensboro last Saturday. The Tar Heels hit their stride, and got on the formidable slow ball artist to rout Virginia 11 to 1 in a leading upset of the past week.

The Davidson diamondmen leave this week to take on Duke and Wake Forest. The Deacons’ record is known to all students, and Duke has just returned from a most successful northern invasion, numbering Princeton, Fordham, and Manhattan among its victims. These games will go a long way toward determining the state championship.

Fraternity baseball is progressing, with the Pikas already in the finals of the upper bracket, and the Phi Delts, Kappa Sigs, and the Phi Gams still in the race in the lower division. According to advance dope, and the predictions of some of Davidson’s leading amateur prognosticators, the Kappa Sigma nine will be the team to oppose the Pi K. A. boys for the title. However, the Phi Gams and the Phi Delts may have something to say about this.

The golfers hit the road this week, minus the services of the long-driving Jack Wagner, and Johnny Thompson. Bob Gregory and Tom Bowles have been added to the team to replace these men who are unable to compete further because of an overabundance of cuts. Emory, Georgia Tech, Clemson, and Furman will be met on this southern trip.

The tennis team meets Wake Forest here in their only engagement for the coming week. The team has been materially strengthened by the return of Blue Devils Conquer Wildcat Cindermen in Meet Last Saturday Davidson Varsity Receives First Defeat of Season by Score: of 78¼ to 47¼, FULMER HIGH SCORER Fleagle Wins in Century as Cochran Ties Shot-put Record

The Duke University cindermen, making good use of their great strength in the distance events, handed the Davidson track team their first defeat of the season Saturday, coming out atop a score of 78¼ to 47¼. Fulmer of Duke was high scorer of the meet with 11 points, gathered from firsts in the 440-yard dash and the broad jump and a third in the century. Brownlee, captain of the Duke team, scored 10 points with wins in the furlong and the 220-yard low hurdles. Captain Fleagle and Flinn were leading scorers for Davidson with eight points apiece.

Gobblers Take Brace Of Ball Games From Davidson Aggregation

V. P. I.’s Sluggers Whip Into Action to Lick Wildcats Twice, 7-0 and 4-1

Davidson's varsity baseball team suffered two straight defeats at the hands of a strong V. P. I. aggregation on May 3 and 4, the scores being 7-0 and 4-1. The games were played on the Gobblers’ diamond at Blacksburg, Va.

In the first encounter, V. P. I. played airtight ball, being led on the mound by Sutherland, who allowed the Wildcats only three scattered hits. The Techmen hit well to secure nine bingles off Baily, Davidson southpaw, including triples by Cottle and Casey, and circuit swats by Downing and Morgan. Batting honors went to Downing, who had two hits out of three trips to the plate.

It was Davidson's turn to hit well in the second contest, and the ’Cats secured six bingles to V. P. I’s four. However, the Techmen bunched their hits in the pinches to win. The lone run for the Wildcats came in the eighth inning, while the Gobblers tallied two in the third, and one in the fourth and seventh innings. West pitched the entire game for Davidson, while Mitchell went the route for the V. P. I. nine.

Pearce, Joe Morrison, and Peabody Account for Three Runs for Davidson

MANN LEADS OPPONENTS
First Defeat for Virginians in Eight Starts Dealt by Locals

Invading Hampden-Sydney's formidable “Death Valley,” the Davidson nine, behind airtight pitching of its little southpaw, Charlie Pearce, licked the Tigers, 3 to 2, in a twelve-inning fracas on May 2. The overtime contest was a slab duel between Mann and Pearce, with the latter coming out on top, although he gave up seven bingles to Mann’s six. The victory of Davidson brought to an end a winning streak of eight contests for Hampden-Sydney. Pearce, besides pitching a whale of a game, also led his team at bat, getting two hits out of five trips to the plate. Mock, Peabody, and the Morrison brothers counted for Davidson’s other safeties. Humphries, Hampden-Sydney shortstop, led his team’s attack with the willow, getting two for five.
