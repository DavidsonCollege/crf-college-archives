### Multiple alcohol-related citations, hospital visits prompt concern about freshman drinking

For many students, the prospect of going off to college calls to mind a number of tantalizing images — freedom from parents, eating Doritos for breakfast, waking up at 12:20 for a 12:30 lecture. And, of course, wild college parties — at which everyone has a great time amidst a constant flow of beer to those over and under 21 alike.

Unfortunately, in the first month of the Davidson school year, many students have discovered an unpleasant flip side to that image — police citations and trips to the hospital.

At an off-campus party the weekend before classes started, officers responding to a noise complaint surprised a number of Davidson students. Despite a note from Dean of Students Tom Shandley requesting that freshmen not be invited to such gatherings, many first-year students were present when the police arrived. According to Shandley, 12 Davidson students (not all of whom were freshmen) were cited by the Town of Davidson for underage consumption of alcohol, and one senior was arrested for disorderly conduct. Furthermore, four students made trips to Lake Norman Hospital. All four were, fortunately, released within a few hours of being treated.

“All of these students were consuming punch with excessive amounts of alcohol,” Shandley stated, adding that there was no information to suggest that more students had made the trek to the emergency room.

Since that weekend, Shandley said, things have been “normal, if not better than normal,” and pointed to one of the most “incident-free” First Nights Down in recent years.

In fact, there seems to be little indication that the citations and hospital visits reflect a dramatic increase in underage alcohol consumption. Davidson President Bobby Vagt frankly admitted, “I can’t say it’s particularly disproportionate to other years.”

The increase seems not to be in Davidson drinking, but in police response. Shandley hypothesized that many students were “surprised that the Town Police would actually cite them,” but said, “when you live off-campus, you live by the rules of the town.”

Shandley explained that the college is under little, if any, obligation to discipline students living off-campus when they are cited by outside authorities. “It’s a civil and criminal matter,” he explained, adding that when a student goes off-campus “the school’s authority is limited.”

Technically, first-year students are not allowed off-campus at a Patterson Court-affiliated party until First Night Down. However, the definition of a “court-affiliated party” is, according to one student, “very ambiguous.” Many freshmen (for whom most other parties are not an option) choose to give them the benefit of the doubt.

Some students feel that upperclassmen do little to clarify the issue. “There are a lot of frats that deliberately invite freshmen girls to off-campus parties,” commented one, who asked to remain anonymous.

“I think we are very lucky, and there are some students renting houses off-campus who are very lucky, that they did not get arrested for distribution of alcohol to underage drinkers, which is a serious offense in this state,” Vagt said bluntly.

“One of my real disappointments is that those citations and visits to the hospital were functions of parties that occurred off-campus, where even if the underclassmen don’t know better, the upperclassmen should.

“Maybe that’s too harsh, maybe upperclassmen have no more responsibility, but I like to think Davidson students look out for each other.”

Shandley pointed out that students have to get permission to live off-campus. “Maybe we need to review what’s involved in that permission.”

A greater concern than misdemeanor citations is the possibility that someone might get hurt as a result of careless drinking. Such concerns are a key reason behind PE 101 sessions and the mandatory speeches all first-years interested in the Court are required to attend. “This is one of the areas that requires lots of judgment on their part — on everyone’s part — and that judgment doesn’t come built in, always,” Vagt said.

RLO also trains hall counselors extensively with regard to alcohol policy and safety. Kristine Harrington ’03 is a hall counselor on Second Little. Harrington admits that her “biggest fear was facing an alcohol problem. I felt like I could deal with everything else... a lot of experimentation goes on in the first year, and we just want to make sure everyone’s safe.”

Her training included extensive role-playing and “what ifs” to prepare hall counselors for the possibility that their residents might need to be cited — or worse, taken to the hospital.

There are also extensive efforts to explain both the alcohol policy on-campus and possible off-campus consequences to all students, especially freshmen. “I don’t think anyone can plead ignorance,” Harrington said.

Shandley urged the student body to “be vigilant about your own personal safety,” and remember that a trip to the hospital is “by no means the worst thing that could happen... it’s not always a bad thing for students to get medical attention.”
