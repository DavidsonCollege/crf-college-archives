**EDITORIAL**

The team leaves Saturday for Winston-Salem to meet Guilford in the first game of the season. We would like to
see the Cheer Leader get the students busy on plenty of yells, especially with that big bunch of Freshmen. Our
team looks good so far, so what do you say to giving them a rousing send-off?

The Million Dollar Campaign will soon be a success. The picture of the student body taken last Monday to be
used as an advertisement will cause many a hidden shekel to come our way.

**LET THERE BE LIGHT!**

Once again the college authorities are trying to do something that last session proved an impossibility; that is, they are
again installing light bulbs in all the corridors of the dormitories and other places frequented by everybody in the endeavor
to keep the premises well illuminated. At the present time the campus is well lighted, but how long is this
condition going to last? The answer is left entirely to the students themselves, and we certainly hope that they will
think twice before appropriating a public light for private use. It always has been and still is a mystery why
the students are guilty of such action, for the monetary value involved is almost too negligible for consideration, and our
conclusion is that it is pure thoughtlessness. Yet though it be thoughtlessness, it is a violation of the student body
regulations in regard to stealing and is, therefore, a shipping offense. It is to be regretted that even our “Y”
room has already suffered this early in the session the loss of a light. This is one place that should
go untouched if no other, for here it is that many boys find the pleasure and comforts that drive away
the dreadful malady of homesickness. So, students of Davidson College, let's see that each one makes it a point to
leave public lights in their proper place; then, as we go from place to place over the campus at night
it will not be a series of falling into holes, stumbling over objects in the halls, and tumbling down the
stairs. Let's think about our college and keep it well lighted instead of a place conspicuous by the absence of
light. Let's think about the other fellow and how it will inconvenience him. Let's see if our loyalty and unselfishness
to our school and fellow students along this one line cannot at least be one thousand percent.

**“PEP”**

The word “pep” was unknown to Webster and consequently is not found in the dictionaries of today. Nevertheless, this word
carries with it a definite meaning wherever it is used. We hear the coach in football urge his men to
put “pep” into the plays, to practice with “pep,” and to go into the game full of “pep.” We hear
army officers urging their men to put “pep” into the drills, and we know how the American soldiers went “over
the top” across No Man's Land with plenty of “pep” in them. In fact, we find that to make a
success in almost any line, it is necessary to have “pep” and plenty of it. What does this little word
of three letters mean? It simply means a whole heart thrown into some work with a determination to see it
through. It is a smile on the face, a grit of the teeth, and a firm grip on one’s self.
We lay aside the numerous abstract terms that may be used to define “pep” and take ourselves to the gridiron.
Here we see eleven men in football togs lined up and facing eleven other men somewhat similarly lined up. Filling
the bleachers on either side we find hundreds of men cheering and yelling with bands playing and pennants flying. Then
we see two men dressed in white with ribbons of different colors wound about them, place themselves in front of
the bleachers and lead men in yells which echo and reecho until the very ground seems to tremble with the
sways of the cheerleaders. This, fellows, is “pep” and this is what Davidson lacks. When such a demonstration of “pep”
is shown on the part of the students the team goes into battle with every man's whole heart and mind
thrown into the fight. For some reason or other “pep” is not very conspicuous on Davidson campus. We have the
College Spirit all right and the team always knows that every man in the student body is squarely behind it,
but the driving “pep” is absent. This year Davidson has the numbers to make yells heard. We also have plenty
of good yells, and need only practice to learn them and learn to make them heard. A good time to
practice is at the movies each week. Let's all turn out and back Charley Vance in an old-fashioned “pep” meeting
at the movies every week.

**SUPPOSE**

Suppose the association in your college went out of existence tomorrow, would anyone be aware of the fact? Suppose all
your friends at once adopted your habits of Bible study and prayer, would they be the better for it? Suppose
every Christian man and woman in college took your attitude toward the familiar evils of your campus, would your college
soon know a new and better day? Suppose you spent as much time in praying for your friend as you
do in criticizing or discussing him, would you both be the better for it? Suppose you give as faithful attention
to your duties this year as we expect from those of our number who are in the army. What will
happen? Suppose you had to live by yourself for several weeks. What sort of companionship would you have? Suppose everyone
in the colleges of North America took as earnest and practical an interest as you take in the vast host
of men in the terrible dreariness of the army prison camps. Would their pitiful lot be any better? Suppose your
acts and motives were judged just as generously as you judge others, would the opinions so formed of you be
kind as well as fair?—North American Student.

**BE ON TIME**

It seems strange at this day and age, when precision and accuracy count for so much, that any rational person
should have to be reminded of hisimportance. Yet it is often said of college students that they are irresponsible and
not to be depended upon. This is a grave indictment under any circumstance, and the more so because it is
true in many cases. It would seem that a college student, with all his advantages of training and discipline, ought
to know that appointments are to be kept and should be regarded as sacred when an appointment is made. The
business world will not tolerate tardiness under any conditions. The business man who cannot meet his obligations on time goes
under. A minute lost is an opportunity. The world has no place for the man who is careless of his
own or another man's time. Perhaps the penalty for laxness in college students is not sufficient to impress upon their
minds the importance of promptness. But college life is real life, and the careless student must learn his lesson some
time. Be warned, then, if this applies to you; make promptness, precision, and accuracy the foundation of your plans. Be
on time at recitations; keep your appointments to the minute; do what you promise to do. Show the world that
its condemnation of college students is unjust; prove to the world that the college student can be depended upon.—Ripon College
Days.

CAMPUSISMS.

Butch McCoy, ex-'17, has been on the hill for several days assisting coach Crayton with the football squad. McCoy had
charge of the linemen and reports that he is well pleased with the entire squad.

An addition has been made to the bowl-shaped tennis court by a ditch running through one corner of it. This
practically stops tennis until the ditch is refilled.

A sight which brings back pleasant (?) remembrances of the S. A. C. T., has been noticed on the campus
the past few days. The men of A. and B. Cos. were busily engaged in removing the cosmoline from their
Springfield rifles which were issued last week.

Beginning Monday, September 15, the Book Room will be open for one hour only each day, from 9 to 10
A. M.

The Treasurer's office will be open for business with the students until 1 o'clock each day and closed for office
work and routine matters after that hour.

Scene of Beautiful Wedding

Miss Christenberry Becomes Wife of H. C. Northrope—Will Make Their Home in Lynn, Mass.

On Wednesday evening September 10 there was solemnized at the Methodist Church a most impressive wedding ceremony when Miss Bertie
Rhyne Christenbury, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. S. J. Christenbury, became the bride of Mr. Henry C. Northrope, of Lynn,
Mass.

The church was beautifully decorated in plants and flowers, and across the entire back of the church was a veritable
bowery of ferns and clinging ivy. The white carpet for the bride to walk upon led up to this solid
wall of ivy and ferns. Preceding the entrance of the bridal party, Mr. Carl J. Matthews rendered the old love
song, “Because,” to the accompaniment played by Miss Hattie Thompson at the piano. The bride entered on the arm of
the groom. They proceeded to the altar to the strains of Mendelssohn’s, where the ceremony was performed by Chaplain W.
A. Jenkins, U. S. A., assisted by Rev. M. B. Woosley, pastor of the church. Those attending were: Miss Callie
Christenbury with Mr. Walter Henderson, Miss Bonnie Shelton with Mr. Lloyd Christenbury, brother of the bride, Miss Margaret Hendricks with
Mr. Everett Booe, Miss Mary Christenbury and Mr. Jim Blue. Miss Sarah Eunice Armour of Charlotte bore the ring that
was used in that impressive ceremony.

The bride was one of Davidson's most charming and talented young girls, being formerly a teacher in the Davidson High
Schools. The groom is well known in Charlotte and Camp Greene Circles, since he was formerly camp business manager of
the army Y. M. C. A. there, and was also editor of the Camp Greene edition of Trench and Camp,
in its day. Later he enlisted in the Eight Massachusetts infantry. He is a graduate of the University of Wisconsin
and is now serving as internal revenue inspector for income tax at Boston, Mass.

COMPARATIVE IMPRESSIONS.

(Editor's Note: There are at Davidson a number of men who came here after two or three years spent at
other colleges. It is our purpose to have them tell us through the “Forum” how Davidson’s customs and ideals compare
with those of the colleges they have forsaken).

THE OUTSTANDING IMPRESSION

It’s like coming from a part of the world in which one is only an unconsidered cog to a place
where good fellowship and friendly personal interest is all about and abundantly evidenced. The outstanding differences are unity of interests
and personal attention on the part of faculty and fellows as against simply personal interests and only collective attention. It
is hard to make comparative remarks until one is longer a member of a new social group than the writer
has been, but if one outstanding feature is so instantly commanding, then, that feature alone must be worthy. The fine
spirit prevailing here at Davidson cannot be unnoticed even by the most casual or disinterested person and when a fellow
tries to accustom himself then it is that this “Spirit of Davidson” puts out a firm, fine right hand of
comradeship and good will.

Stephen Decatur once gave this toast: “My country! In its intercourse with other nations, may she always be right, but
right or wrong, my country!” Davidson first always! May she be always first in fellowship and fairness, first in service
and forever first in our hearts.

A Run for His Money.

Client (after confession)—"Do you think you will be able to keep me out of jail?"
Lawyer—"I may not be able to do that, but I can make the State spend a lot of money in
putting you there.”—Boston Transcript.

To the groom we give our heartiest congratulations, to the bride, we regret very much your departure from our midst,
but still we can but wish you the happiest of happy futures. Mr. and Mrs. Northrop will be at home
118 Johnston Street, Lynn, Mass.

“Y” Plans for Coming Year Outlined at Sunday Meeting

Chalmers, McAlister and Askew Give Detailed Description of Various Activities

The “Y” plans for the coming year were presented at the “Y” service Sunday night. The purpose of this meeting
was to give every member of the student body a definite and concrete idea of what the association is doing.
Chalmers, the first speaker on the program, placed before those present the plans for the regular Sunday evening services as
he said: “A man’s afterlife is largely determined by the choices which he makes in college.” The services will be
made as interesting as possible. Special music will be rendered very often. These meetings are the students’ own meetings and
should be so considered by them.

Lacy McAlister then, as chairman of the Bible study committee, presented the program of the Bible classes. The college year
will be divided in terms of three months each. The first three months will be taken up with a book
called “The Social Principles of Jesus;” the second term will be taken up with Bible study and the third with
mission study. McAlister is planning to arrange an attendance contest with Tech. Heretofore Sunday schools in the near vicinity of
Davidson have been partially run by college men. Askew, as head of the Sunday school work, stated that this work
would be continued this year as in the past, and that men would go to the following places: Brawley's, Caldwell,
Oak Grove, Cowan’s, Shearer Chapel, the Mill and Cornelius. Under the leadership of Askew this work is sure to be
a success.

By the assistance of a quartette composed of Currie, McGeachy, Matthews and Freeman, the program Sunday night was made much
better.
