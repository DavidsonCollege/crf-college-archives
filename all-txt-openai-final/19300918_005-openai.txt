Three Professors Are Inaugurated in June
Williams, Brown and Pritchett Installed by Trustees Last Commencement

Among the additional features of the commencement program last June was the inauguration ceremony of three professors into the faculty
list of Davidson College. The three professors were Prof. Williams, Prof. Brown, and Prof. Norton Pritchett. These men have been
connected with Davidson from two to seven years and have become quite a part of the college life here. Their
inauguration was the result of a decision of the Board of Trustees at their meeting last semester.

Professors Williams was inaugurated as professor of Business Administration. He came to Davidson in 1926. Professor Williams received his B.S.
degree from Davidson and his M.A. from New York University. The Board also named him as dean of Freshmen. Formerly,
Professor Williams was known as assistant dean of students.

Prof. C. K. Brown, A.M., Ph.D., was inaugurated as professor of Economics. He is also a Davidson man, having received
his A.B. degree here. He also attended the University of North Carolina, University of Besançon, and Columbia University.

Professor Pritchett was inaugurated as professor of Physical Education. He attended the University of Tennessee, University of Louisville, University of
Wisconsin, and Harvard University. At the inaugural ceremony Mr. R.A. Dunn, president of the Board of Trustees, propounded the usual
questions and administered the oath of office.

COACHING STAFF (Continued from page 1)

devoting most of his attention to these two sports. Heath Whittle, the other addition to the coaching staff, is assistant
in intra-mural sports and will also help out in other sports. Having finished Davidson last year as one of the
foremost track stars of all times here, he will prove a very welcome addition to the coaching staff of this
sport.

There are eight Freshmen out for football manager. This is one of the largest numbers to come out for this
position in the history of the school. This is a very good showing for boys who have just come into
the college. All of them seem to be doing excellent work and it is hoped that they will continue to
do as well. Football manager is the most coveted managership in the school, but it is the hardest on the
campus to get and the man that gains this position clearly deserves it. The managers are allowed to stay out
until the end of their Sophomore year and then all but three of the managers are dropped. Then at the
end of their Junior year, the football lettermen vote for these men to decide who is to be varsity football
manager and who is to be Freshman football manager. The one receiving the largest number of votes is to be
varsity football manager, the one receiving the next largest number of votes is to be Freshman football manager, and the
other man loses out. The following Freshmen are out for Freshman football manager: Wilbur Fugate, Harold Eskins, Frank Holt, John
Drake, B. F. Ormand, W. A. Kirkland, Barry Caldwell, and Albert Colwell.

Five and Ten Years Ago
Sept. 17, 1925—Record enrollment! This year’s enrollment of 628 breaks even the large enrollment of last year by ten.This number
only four are co-eds and ten are men who have been out of school for a while. There are still
seven more men who have made satisfactory arrangements with the treasurer, but who have failed to register properly. Consequently, the
number may increase to 635. This number is in no way near the number who applied for entrance to the
institution. Approximately 225 men who applied for admission to the Freshman Class were turned down for lack of classroom. In
spite of the present crowded conditions, all of those upperclassmen who were in doubt as to their chance to enroll
were admitted and duly enrolled.

Sept. 17, 1920—New football coach. Great was the joy of the Davidson students when they learned that Hugh Grey was
to be coach this year. Not only was he one of our stars when in college, but since his graduation
has been turning out winning teams at Bailey Military Institute. Coach Grey became an alumnus of Davidson in the spring
of 1918, having been one of the best all-around athletes ever at this institution. He played on the football team
for three years, being honored in his last year by an All-American selection. In addition to his football, he was
a track star, winning his “D” three times and setting records for the shot put and discus events.

the President. Just as Forest Hills and Wimbledon are the capitals of tennis and Madison Square Garden of the boxing
world, Camp Perry is the capital of the world of marksmanship. Teams from every nation meet here in the summer
for the great international matches, coming from as far as Siam, Argentina, Switzerland, and other countries.

LEADERS OF CAMPUS (Continued from page 1) by J. M. McConnell, dean of instruction, then delivered an address on Student
Scholarship. The care of the dormitories was told to the Freshmen by Mrs. N. T. Smith, who has charge of
the dormitories. How to use their time to the best advantage was told to the new men by Professor Fleagle,
of the Spanish Department. The Honor System of Davidson was told to the Freshmen by Dan Goodykoontz, president of the
Student Body. The social and various campus organizations were explained to the new students by Carl Pritchett, secretary of the
Y. M. C. A. The dean of students, Dr. M. E. Sentelle, told the first-year men about the rules and
regulations of Davidson. On Wednesday night, Mr. F. L. Jackson, treasurer of the college, informed the Freshmen about the college
finances and how to take care of money and property. Dr. Walter I. Lingle, Davidson's president, gave the main address
of the evening and the closing one of the orientation exercises on “What Davidson Means to a Student.” This address
had the sound advice which is invaluable to a first-year man. In opening, he said: “Davidson College began getting ready
for you ninety-four years ago. You feel something of the spirit of those who have gone before; absorb it, and
then contribute your part.” In relation to college friendship, he said that the biggest asset in life is your friends
made in college, for they are the finest, best, and closest. Another of his fine words of advice was “Davidson
will mean to you what you will make it mean.”

Four New Homes Built During Summer Vacation

Students returning to the campus this fall have doubtless noticed new residences looming on and in the vicinity of the
campus. Dr. Thos. W. Lingle, Dr. H. B. Arbuckle, and Dr. C. K. Brown have all built new residences on
the Concord Road about a mile from the center of the campus, and a home for Prof. Lewis B. Schenck
has been constructed on North Main Street by W. E. Potts, contractor. With these people moving out of the houses
they have occupied, others have moved into them. F. L. Jackson, treasurer of the college, is located in the former
Arbuckle home; Fred W. Hengeveld, registrar, is in the Lingle house; Myron W. McGill, auditor, is occupying the home formerly
used by Mr. Hengeveld; Capt. F. M. Cochran, who is replacing Capt. John W. Elkins in the R. O. T.
C. Department, will take the house vacated by the latter. Capt. Norton G. Pritchett, professor of Physical Education, is undecided
whether he will move. If he does, he will take the home occupied by the late Prof. L. B. Henderson.
Dr. Price Gwynn's decision as to his location depends upon what Captain Pritchett decides. Dr. Gwynn will either occupy the
Henderson place, the Pritchett house, or the former Jackson house.

Alumni Secretary Given New Office

The combination alumni publicity office at Davidson College has recently changed its location and is now situated on the first
floor of Chambers Building, the central structure on the Davidson campus. Since the establishment of the alumni and publicity department,
jointly operated by Ernest Milton, the office has been located in Elm Row, one of the original buildings constructed when
Davidson was founded in 1837. The building was separated from the main scene of activity. Moving the office to the
new building, however, puts the alumni secretary and publicity director in closer touch with the administration and is more convenient
when visiting alumni return to the campus. This is another step toward the centralization of the college offices in the
administration building. Now, all college offices, with the exception of the R. O. T. C., are located in Chambers Building.

SHAKESPEARE PLAY (Continued from page 1)

Dr. Laing is professor of Latin and dean of the Graduate School of the University of Chicago, and is also
general editor of the University of Chicago Press. He has been editor of the Classical Journal and is the editor
of many selections from Latin literature and a contributor to philological publications. Dr. Laing has had a great deal of
experience on the lecture platform; he is well known all over the country as a lecturer of great wit and
humor. A delightful time is in store for anyone who has the opportunity to hear him.

ABSENCE AFFECTS HOURS (Continued from page 1)

For each sixteen absences which are on the permanent record, one semester hour will be deducted from a student's total
semester hours. Therefore, for example, if at the end of four years, a student has only 132 hours required for
graduation, and has 80 absences on permanent record, the number of semester hours will be reduced by five and he
will have only 127 semester hours, five short of the number required for graduation. However, Dr. Sentelle emphasized that since
the administration desires to stress quality rather than quantity of work, any student who averages A in any course would
have all the absences which are recorded on the permanent record erased. Those averaging B would have half of the
absences on permanent record removed, and all grades below B would have to suffer the full amount. As an example,
if a student should happen to have even forty-eight absences during four years’ work, excused or unexcused, which have become
permanent records, and he averages A for four years in all his courses collectively, he would not be affected by
a reduction of semester hours. Of course, this example is only general, since each course is treated separately. A further
discussion of the absence regulations is found in the booklet.
