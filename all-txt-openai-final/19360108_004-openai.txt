4 THE DAVIDSONIAN, JANUARY 8, 1936

FLORIDA ALUM HOLD MEETING

Miami Grads Organize Chapter; Jacksonville Group Elects Officers

Two meetings of Davidson Alumni chapters were held in Florida during the holidays. At the first of these meetings, a
new chapter was organized at Miami. The first meeting was held at the University Club in Miami, Florida, on the
twenty-seventh of December. There were about forty alumni attending the meeting with their friends and wives. This was the first
meeting to be held in Miami, and at that time a Davidson Alumni chapter was permanently organized. The program was
arranged by Grier Martin with the aid of W. C. and L. C. McAskill. This program consisted mainly of Davidson
football games and other scenes around the campus. A moving picture of Davidson football games was the main topic of
interest at the Miami meeting. W. C. Cumming was elected president of the Miami Alumni chapter and L. C. McAskill
was elected secretary.

The second meeting was held in Jacksonville, Florida, on December the thirtieth. This chapter had already been organized and the
program was the same as in the first meeting. Dr. W. M. Shaw was elected president of the Jacksonville alumni
chapter at a former meeting. At this meeting, T. S. Baker was elected president, George Green vice president, and Herbert
Newman treasurer. T. S. Baker was elected secretary for the next year.

Centennial Plates Can Be Ordered This Week

The original plates will be sent off this week. Those students who wish to place an order for the centennial
plates and have not done so as yet can see Grier Martin and get their order sent off with the
original one this week. Any other people wishing to obtain a set of these plates may do so by writing
Grier Martin.

Freshman Cage Squad Resumes Night Drills

Under the direction of Coach “Chet” Chapman, the Kitten Cagers are continuing their practices for the coming schedule of eight
games. The squad has decided to elect no captain before the end of the season; “Chet” Chapman appoints a captain
for each game, and after the schedule has been played the squad will choose the player whom they think is
the best leader.

Outstanding among the players who have reported regularly for practice are the following: Ned Iverson, popularly known as “Obble-Gobble,” who
has been holding down the key position of center; Grant Johnson, who has been playing both forward and guard; Jack
Lee, who alternates with Iverson for center; Tice, small but fast and tricky forward; Warren Gaw, Perry Sloan and Bill
Boyd, all of whom play in the defensive positions.
