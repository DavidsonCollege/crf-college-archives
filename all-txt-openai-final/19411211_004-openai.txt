**CAT CHAT By LACY MacLEAN**

The first real test for Davidson’s cagers is ahead of them. They tangle with Carolina Saturday night in Charlotte in what is growing into an annual Queen City classic. It is one of the first of the important conference engagements each year, and this winter it's pushed up even more than usual.

**A Little History**

Despite the usual superiority of the White Phantoms on the hardwood, each of the contests has been tops for spectator interest, and this year may not be out of line. Last fall the Wildcats took the floor as definite underdogs, but they held Gorgeous George Glamack in check and tallied a few themselves, and made it an exceedingly fast game until reserve strength began telling on them late in the game. The game last year was in Winston-Salem and Chapel Hill, and Davidson lost them both by an eight-point margin, 38-30, and 39-31, but they achieved what few other teams in the South were able to do: hold the high-flying Phantoms down to a low score, and best All-American Glamack with an individual rival.

This year Carolina has been forced to remodel her attack to a great extent. Glamack’s unorthodox firing ability had forced the Heels into a mode of attack which was hot with the big boy, but nothing without him, and this year he's gone, leaving Coach Bill Lange in somewhat of a hole. To meet the situation, the Carolina board of strategy decided to shift 6-4 inch Bob Rose, a starter at forward last year, to the center spot. Rose, an excellent ball handler and floor man, can also shoot the pellet with the best of them, and the Phantoms may present a more balanced and orthodox system than they used before. There is no doubt that their talent is superior to ours, but if they are still having trouble with a new kind of basketball, and if the Cats have an on night, the chances are fifty-fifty.

**Cat Strategy**

In the way of changing systems, Davidson has done a little on her own hook. In the first two games of the year, Coach Shepard concentrated on the two men in, with three out system: that is, two men went down into the two corners under the Davidson basket, leaving three men on the outside to work the ball into them. But lately, the strategy has been modified to a certain extent. The Cats have shifted occasionally to the opposite strategy with three men close in and two bringing the ball down the court. The first mentioned plan is designed for an open or clear center, and the points must be made from shots when the players are breaking toward the basket, thus the center should not be congested so that they couldn’t make their breaks toward the basket. In the new system, the plan is more one of putting the men close in in the first place, passing into them and taking chance shots from close to the basket where the guarding is closer rather than the waiting game of making a clean break for each shot. And the new game, varied with the use of the two men in system, should put the long tall boys in a better position to make the points a little faster than they had been manufacturing them before.

**The Preliminary**

As a preliminary match to the varsity game, the frosh squad tangles with Central High of Charlotte. The Charlotte Silver Streaks will form perhaps the toughest opposition that the Kittens have seen yet and will prove somewhat of a testing ground for them too. In practice and against the teams that they’ve played so far, especially against Pfeiffer Junior College last Saturday, they looked almost too good to be true. The first combination of Tommy and George Peters, Abie Chort, Harry Hudson, and Jackie Byrd, look like the best frosh five in years and they’ve got a bunch of good reserves right behind them. Flop Shaw, Heywood Brinnegar, Jim Lowry, Sammy Yarbrough, Bill Sutton, and others are pushing hard for first team posts, and may see them. The Kits should mop up the floor with the Streaks, and it'll be good to see them looking like a big league ball club.

**HOBBIE**

**Matmen To UNC, Gentr**

Davidson takes her first step in Southern Conference competition Saturday night when Coach Norman Shepard takes his Charlotte cagers to the armory to meet North Carolina. The early-season game, rapidly becoming a Queen City custom, will begin at 8 P.M., with a preliminary match which matches the Davidson frosh with Central High of Charlotte.

**Carolina Favored**

The White Phantoms, by virtue of their high riding five last season, stand as slight favorites, but the Wildcats with three victories stowed away have acquired the win habit. Davidson's previous victories over J. C. Jones of Charlotte, and two tilts with the Kannapolis Y. M. C. A., are marred only by a shellacking handed them by the Hanes Hosiery outfit of Winston-Salem. Both of Saturday night’s fives on exhibition suffered rather severe losses by graduation, particularly in their ace performers: Wildcat Jimmy Hogg and George Glamack, the Phantom’s high scorer. Both clubs, however, have patched up their ranks into well-rounded quints and the action should be fast and furious.

**Kittens Drill For Wolflets**

With only one more full week of work before the holidays, and facing their initial match of the season and the initial match in nearly all of their careers, against the more experienced N. C. State Frosh soon after the re-opening of school, the Frosh grapplers finished up their hardest week.Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

The frosh outfit went into a tie for second position with a win or a loss apiece, with the juniors bringing up the rear with two losses.

Clyde Stroupe appears to have a toehold on the first string in the 121-pound class, as does Keyhole Browning among the heavier 128 pounders. Tentative Starters A tentative starting line-up might find Dick Coppedge at 135, while the veteran R. L. Brinson looks like for the nod at 145. The 155 situation is as yet uncertain, with Ashby Dick and Ed Patterson the leading candidates. Ben Turnage, another veteran and letterman from last team, shouldn’t have too much trouble in clinching the starting position in the next weight, 165.

Don Bell and Lard Royster are both attempting to oust the last-mentioned from his choice spot. NEILL Davey, Butch In Bowl Game Two of Davidson's senior footballers, “Butch” Caldwell and Davey Spencer, took part in the annual Carolina Bowl post-season football skirmish Saturday at Greenville, S.C., and although the gridders from North Carolina suffered a 14 to 7 defeat, both Spencer and Caldwell were outstanding in the game. Although Spencer did not start the game, Caldwell was one of Head Coach Doc Newton’s choices for the opening whistle and was one of the outstanding linemen on the field on offense and defense. Spencer, who played in a large part of the tilt despite the fact that he wasn’t one of the starters, also turned in a fine performance. Coach Gene McEver of the Wildcat coaching staff was another Davidsonian on hand for the festivities along with Dave Vosburgh, the all-American manager. The Shriners presented the boys with handsome watches after the game. GREYHOUND of Course FROM DAVIDSON— It’s really not much of a problem — deciding how to go home for the Holidays.
