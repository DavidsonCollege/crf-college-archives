### Construction on Schedule

The new Dining Commons and Peter Knox and Mary Irwin Belk dormitories will open in September 1981, according to Physical
Plant Director Grover Meetze. The College is also considering plans for a new athletic complex and an arts building.

Construction of the Commons is now on schedule after earlier delays, Meetze said, while the two new dorms behind Patterson
Court are proceeding ahead of schedule.

The $3.6 million Commons will seat 600 people. The building will be twenty-five or thirty feet further south than originally
planned. This will save the College twenty-five to thirty thousand dollars, Meetze estimates, by allowing Bailey and Richards houses to
remain as one food service unit until after construction is complete. The two houses will then be moved to opposite
ends of Patterson Court.

The dorms will cost about $1.2 million. Housing Director Bill Bolding said no one has decided who will occupy the
dorms, but they will probably not house freshmen.

Meetze said the construction plan for the Commons is to finish as much of the outside work as possible before
the weather turns cold. The concrete shell and the kitchen are already in place.

Initial planning for a new sports complex has also begun, Meetze said. The complex, designed primarily for intramural use, will
probably include facilities for swimming, basketball, tennis, and track, as well as a gym with capacity comparable to that of
Johnston Gym. No date or price has been set for construction. The complex will probably be located behind Johnston Gymnasium.

### Minister of Students Rush Otey Leaves for LSU

By TIM WHALEN
Staff Writer

Minister to Students Rush Otey left Davidson at the end of August to become campus minister at Louisiana State University
(LSU). Dean of Students Will Terry said the search for Otey’s replacement should begin within a week or two.

Otey, who was also Assistant Minister at Davidson College Presbyterian Church (DCPC), said he took the new job because he
felt “ready for something more pluralistic” after seven years at Davidson.

“In some ways he produced the best religious programming here since I was a student, including my years as chaplain,”
Terry said. “He made us uncomfortable in ways that we needed to be made uncomfortable, and we’ll miss that.”

Otey said he misses his involvement in student programs like the Y Service Corps. He hopes students continue to take
an active interest in issues of general concern such as the military draft and world hunger as well as in
more immediate concerns, especially student government. “Davidson tends to be an autocratic institution, and students need to work to retain
the voice they do have,” Otey said.

Before the search for a new minister can begin, the College and DCPC must finish discussion of the exact duties
of the new minister. They have already decided that the new minister will have fewer responsibilities at DCPC so he
can work more with students, Terry said. Terry promised that students would have an important role in selecting the new
minister.

Otey said that at LSU he works with a very diverse group including graduate students, foreign students, and minority students.
His new job also allows him to concentrate exclusively on counseling and working on projects concerned with issues like criminal
justice and world hunger.

### Clarification

A front page story in the May 9 issue of The Davidsonian might have given the impression that the Admissions
Department is seeking a more homogenous student body composed as much as possible of southern students. Admissions Director John Griffith
said this week, however, that his department seeks to develop a very heterogeneous student body and is beginning programs designed
to recruit more students from other areas of the country.

### DeSieno Prepares for New Computer System

By WALTER LEE
Staff Writer

Robert DeSieno became Davidson's first Director of Computer Services this month. DeSieno, formerly a chemistry professor at Westminster College in
New Wilmington, Pennsylvania, has an extensive background in computers. This fall DeSieno will coordinate plans for a new College computer
center. Davidson will overhaul its present computer facility and purchase a new system.

DeSieno said he is now assessing Davidson's future computer needs. No details about the new system have been set. A
new system will eliminate many of the problems of registration by employing a more direct method of processing information, DeSieno
said. The computer now in use relies on punch cards and much human handling and communication. Students will also have
greater access to the new system, according to DeSieno, since there will be more terminals available.

DeSieno said he hopes to dispel the computer's reputation as a “technological devil” in liberal arts environments. “The knowledge of
computers,” DeSieno wrote in a College newsletter, “should be an essential part of a liberal arts education.” As computers become
more and more a part of everyone's life, knowing something about their operation must become a basic life skill.”
