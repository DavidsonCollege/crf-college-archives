“THE HOUSE OF SERVICE”

Write for a Catalogue, Prices and Terms

By M. R. Doubles.

This Week’s Prize Bone. Fresh Walthall on French pulls the following translation: “The geese were being driven down the road
by a girl with a stick nine years old.”

Credit Dwight With One More. After the Columbia Four had rendered two sacred selections in chapel—along comes the “Y” secretary
to announce that they would sing popular songs at the movies, though they hadn't sung that kind at chapel—Better luck
next time, D. Moody.

“THE WORLD'S BEST PIANO” And other standard makes and the incomparable AMPICO. Reasonable terms of payment can be arranged. Tuning,
Repairing and Moving.

10 More—Fresh. Fricker to Carothers (whose fresh cap was badly worn in the back)—“Do you call that a fresh cap?”
Fresh Carothers—“Nope; a hair net.”

Fresh Wit. JOHN W. POST & CO. Fresh Jones—“Who was Hezekiah?” Fresh Curtis—“She was the woman in the House of
Seven Gables.”

Extinguished. There was surely an outbreak of “Fire” at Monday’s chapel—but—from what we could see, there was enough hose to
put it out.

Say it with Flowers SCHOLTZ, the Florist Charlotte, N. C. JETTON DRUG COMPANY, AGENTS

Demi Tasse Overheard at the Trough. Romefelt—“Looks like rain, doesn’t it?” Schenck (drinking a cup of water)—“Yes, and tastes like
dishwater.” Shaw—“Absolutely, it has no grounds for existence.”

FOR ALL COLD TROUBLES. VapoRub Over 17 Million Jars Used Yearly

The Wrong Pew. McGukin to Miller (who had just returned from a visit to Charlotte)—“P. D., did you see any
of my friends while in the Queen City?” Miller—“No; I was at the Y. M. C. A. convention.”

Hardly. Gaston of the Senior Class, in reference to commencement—“Well, two more months and I'll be educated.” A friend—“You've got
a lot to learn in two months, Johnnie.”

Prohibition Exam for 1921. Will the moon be allowed to get full? Will a ship be allowed to anchor over
a bar? Will a captain be allowed to put in any port? Will cocktails be allowed on farmers’ roosters? Will
hops be allowed in the dance halls? Will a person be allowed to become drunk with success—or intoxicated with joy?
Will the students be allowed to get shot?

Shot Is Right. When the Fresh Greek class assembled last week, they discovered a machine gun on the prof’s desk.
Another way of getting shot on Greek.

What Relationship? The deputy of a certain fraternal insurance company recently obtained the application of Mr. Luther Erwin, and gladly
escorted that sensible individual before the examining physician. In the process of filling out the papers, Luke was asked to
name his nearest relatives, that they might be designated as beneficiaries. He explained as follows: I met a widow and
married her; she had a step-daughter. My father, a widower, visited us, and married the step-daughter. My wife became the
mother-in-law of her father-in-law, and my step-daughter became my stepmother. My father is my step-son. After a while my step-mother,
the step-daughter of my wife, had a son. This boy is my brother, being my father’s son, but he is
also the son of my wife’s step-daughter, and so her grandson. Therefore, I am my brother's grandfather. Then my wife
had a daughter. My mother-in-law is her stepsister and also her grandmother, because she is her step-son’s child. My father
is the brother of my daughter, who is also the daughter of my grandmother. I am my mother’s brother-in-law, my
wife is her own child’s aunt, my daughter is my father’s niece and I am my own grandfather. When Alkali
finished the above simple statement and easily understood facts, the doctor had collapsed and the deputy had taken to the
woods. The applicant is waiting for someone to come along and designate his beneficiary so that he can join.

WOFFORD DEFEATED. (Continued from page 1) Each side got three more runs. Wofford scored first by—but what's the use? The
score book looks like a pageof Xenophon's Anabasis and the reporter belongs to the union. Let's call it a day
and be satisfied with the—Box score:
