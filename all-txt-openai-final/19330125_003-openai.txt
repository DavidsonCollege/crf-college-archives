INSPIRING TALK GIVEN BY JULIAN S. MILLER
(Continued from page 1)

...said was the very beginning of common sense. Humanity must adopt Jesus’ philosophy of life before any happiness can be obtained. He has never offered a wrong principle and we could never be wrong to follow Him. The truth about life is Christ. Today people have no philosophy of life except—It’s no use! The simple and proved principle of Jesus is the best—try it. The body is a chariot and the soul is the driver. Don't build beautiful bodies as so many are doing today and neglect your soul to let it drive your chariot on the rocks. Jesus is the truth about responsibility in trouble. With us today is that we have lost our conception of the sovereignty of God. We have tried to substitute science as right and denying God the right to rule. To the query, “Who is God?” Jesus answers, “I am.” Conceive God as we conceive Jesus. Get close to God. He is no stranger. “I am the Truth of God” Jesus answers to the question. Christ is the truth about religion also. Religion is no system of theology. It is a human experience. When we strip it of its forms we find it is just a way of life. Once a preacher said religion is ecstasy and...

There will be ten events on the parallel bars, nine on the horizontal bars, nine on the horse, and five in tumbling. Condition tests will be held in the following: chinning, swinging dip, rope climbing, and the cassock step. The individual scoring the highest number of points will receive a trophy. The class having the highest score among the first twenty men will receive 20 points toward the inter-class competition plaque, and the class having the next highest score will receive 15 points. Class number three will be accredited with 10 points, and number four with five. Paul Brown won first place last year with...a divine experience. It is all of that, but it has to get out of the pulpit. To me, religion is service, helping people.

Davidson, when members from each class will try for points in parallel bars, horizontal bars, horse, tumbling, and conditioning events. 

Take religion down from the clouds and clear all of its mystery away and we see that it is practical. Everything Jesus ever said is practical. The success or failure to goodness is what we are. We can be what we want to be. The personal following of Jesus. Once we attach ourselves to it, we are sure of a certain destiny no matter what.

With prayer, Dr. T. W. Lingle dismissed the meeting.

ILLUSION: One of Houdini’s most spectacular escape feats was performed with a huge milk can filled with water. He invited persons from the audience to bring padlocks and lock him into the can. He got into the can, the lid was put on and fastened with several padlocks. A screen was placed in front of the can. Assistants stood by with stopwatches and fire axes to save him from drowning after a certain time. About a minute later, the screen was removed, Houdini was seen panting and dripping... the padlocks remaining intact!

EXPLANATION: The usual method of escaping from a milk can is as follows: The lid of the can is apparently securely padlocked to the lower portion, but actually, the metal band to which the staples are attached is the top of a short inner lining. The performer, after being locked into the can, pushes the lid upward with his head and the short inner lining is forced out of place, permitting his escape. The screen is then removed.

NO TRICKS - JUST COSTLIER TOBACCOS IN A MATCHLESS BLEND

IT'S FUN TO BE FOOLED... IT'S MORE FUN TO KNOW

What exciting magic there is in cigarette advertising! Let’s look at one of its greatest illusions... that cigarettes can be mysteriously given superior “FLAVOR.”

THE EXPLANATION: Just three factors control the flavor of a cigarette. The addition of artificial flavoring... the blending of various tobaccos... and the quality of the tobaccos themselves. Quality is the most important. Artificial flavoring can never wholly disguise the poor flavor of cheap tobaccos. The blending of several cheap, raw tobaccos cannot improve the flavor of any of them. A fine cigarette is a cigarette blended from costly, ripe tobaccos.

It is a fact, well known by leaf tobacco experts, that Camels are made from finer, MORE EXPENSIVE tobaccos than any other popular brand. This is why the Camel flavor has never been rivaled... why Camels have given more pleasure to more people than any other cigarette ever made. In more costly tobaccos lies the secret of Camels’ delicate “bouquet”... of their rich, cool flavor—of their non-irritating mildness. It’s the tobacco that counts. All the natural goodness of Camel’s tobacco is kept fresh and rich for you by the air-tight, welded Humidor Pack. Don’t remove it. Its moisture-proof cellophane also protects your Camels from dust and germs. Put a pack in your pocket today.
