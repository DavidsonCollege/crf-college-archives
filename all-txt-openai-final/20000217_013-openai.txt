THE DAVIDSONIAN

By Aaron PATTON

Following a record-setting fall season, the Davidson Crew yet again impressed the competition at its only winter race of the year, sending 13 rowers to the finals of the Atlanta Erg Sprints. Another remarkable accomplishment was the four medals the crew garnered during the day-long indoor event.

“This race set a solid foundation for the spring season,” said Crew president Amelia Fuller. “It was a strong performance for the team as a whole.”

Many people do not think of rowing during the cold of winter. But that is what makes winter regattas so unique. Instead of racing on lakes or rivers, erg sprints take place entirely indoors on rowing machines called ergs. Competitors row against others in their category over a distance of 2000 meters.

Davidson Crew attended the Atlanta Erg Sprints, hosted by Georgia Tech. The Atlanta race has the distinction of being one of the satellite regattas for the World Championships of indoor rowing.

The first event of the day was the lightweight women’s event. Sophomore Natalie Eft placed fourth, missing the bronze by a mere second. Eft was followed closely by senior Sarah Muffelman, and also raced beside sophomore Tiffany Smith.

“It was unique racing against such a large number of people,” Eft said. “Before, it seemed like every 2000 I pulled was alone. But with the noise of so many people I pulled my best time ever, even though it did not feel like I was pulling any faster.”

Arguably, the crew’s strongest performances of the day came in the novice men’s category as freshman Luke O’Hara scored a silver medal. Also in close contention was freshman Charlie Babcock, who pulled eight seconds faster than his previous best.

“I really had to isolate myself during the race, especially after starting out so fast,” said Babcock. “It took a lot of persistence and dedication to be able to maintain my speed when it hurt so badly in the closing seconds of the race.”

The crew’s first gold medal of the day came from Jason Layman in the indoor-only men’s category. It was the sophomore’s first race ever. In the indoor-only women’s category, freshman Alison Shea was narrowed out to finish a strong fourth. After the race, the crew discovered Shea had rowed the last quarter of the race with a dislocated shoulder.

In a unique event of the day, the coxswains were given a chance to compete. On the water, the coxswain’s job is to steer and encourage their rowers to victory. But in indoor races and on an erg, coxswains compete in a kind of spirit competition. Davidson’s Stephanie Kohler came out on top with an intense performance to win the gold.

Other finalists for Davidson were junior Aaron Patton and senior Matt Johnston in the lightweight men’s event, senior John Potter in the open men’s, freshman Diana Chemotti and sophomore Erin Hudson in the novice women’s, and Jamie Causey in the coxswain’s category.

“I was very surprised with how well we did. It makes me want to improve even more to get ahead of the competition,” said Smith.

On a final note of the day, the Davidson Crew placed third in the team relay, within five seconds of the Georgia Tech and University of Georgia crews.

“We brought a large number of rowers to the event and their support and cheering helped everyone out, if not turning heads of the bigger schools at the same time,” said Fuller. “It’s going to take hard work to maintain this kind of growth as a team, as well as financial support to have comparable facilities to other schools.”

There will be an informational meeting this Thursday, Feb. 17, at 9:00 p.m. in the Union Conference Room for anyone interested in rowing.

Hockey minus the ice
By Mark Hymerling
Guest Writer

Davidson has a roller hockey team, which was created by six Davidson students and two Davidson residents. Junior Jamey Heit, Sophomores Evan McCormick, Brad Stevinson, and Mark Hymerling, and Freshmen Andrew Auster and Bryan Stevinson along with Davidson residents Ron Olson and Dave Smith comprise Davidson’s first roller hockey team.

Each of the eight games is played on Thursday nights at the Charlotte Sports Center. After forfeiting the first game (we were still on break), the team encountered some problems adjusting to playing together and getting their legs working, losing the first game they played. The team regrouped and played a solid game, getting stellar goaltending from Heit, sound defense from the Stevinson brothers, an offensive boost from McCormick, Auster, and Hymerling, and an all-around solid contribution from Ron and Dave, sealing their first win of the season 12-7.

Coming off their first win, the Wildcats raised momentum and confidence with a 10-4 victory in their third game. Despite having only two subs, the team played a much more physical and defensively responsible game, limiting the opposition’s chances and capitalizing on their own. Heit continued to improve and the forwards began to feel comfortable playing alongside one another.

Last week, the Wildcats played Thursday and Friday night, inclined to extend their winning streak to four games. In the Thursday night game, the Wildcats dominated, controlling the puck for much of the contest and seemingly scoring at will. Heit once again led the defense in shutting down the opposition, limiting them to three goals while putting eleven on the board. The Stevinson brothers, Auster, and Hymerling played a crucial game, delivering checks and breaking up rushes. The swift-skating McCormick spearheaded the offense as every player got his name on the score sheet.

Davidson played a make-up game against UNCC Friday night; it had been rescheduled because neither team was back on their respective campuses for the original date. A group of about twenty Davidson students came out to support the team as SGA President Dane Erickson made his coaching debut, accompanied by trainer Marc Naples. The Wildcats jumped to an early 2-0 lead. They carried the momentum throughout the game despite allowing the 49ers to cut the lead in half. After Davidson added two insurance goals, the 49ers got their second and final goal of the night. Heit and the defense led by Auster, Brad and Bryan Stevinson, McCormick, and Hymerling shut the door, killing off three penalties, including a four-minute double minor and finishing off the 6-2 victory.

As the season winds down and the playoffs approach, the Wildcats are consistently improving as they look to capture the championship. The team would like to thank those who came to show their support on Friday night.
