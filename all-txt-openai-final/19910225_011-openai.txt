THE DAVIDSONIAN CAMPUS LIVING. MONDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 1991

Freddie, your desk! How can you keep it? It's a total wreck! - Hit like toe?

You see Robbie, for me my desk is an extension of my mind. I'm going through a very confused period
right now, trying to sort things out.

Nomad is on vacation this week in Aruba. The actions received the following fax:

"Dear Davidsonian,

Greetings from sunny Aruba! The weather here is fantastic, and the local culture is fascinating. I've been trying out the
local currency here in Aruba. Shekels are used here, and I've had the chance to experience a drink called the
Aruba Opium Julius, the nation's signature drink. The other day I met a woman named Olga. It's nothing like America
here. Anyway, if you need to reach me, I'll be at the hotel.

Best regards, Nomad."

Finally, who cares. Love, Nomad.
