McCutcheon and Carr Continue Winning Streak by Defeating Lindsey and Shuller

The Wildcat tennis team fought to a three-all deadlock against Wofford College here Saturday afternoon in a match featured by unusually close and exciting matches. The Terriers, who are champions of South Carolina last year, presented a strong team. Each team won two singles and a doubles match. The bright spot of the afternoon's play from the Wildcat standpoint was the brilliant tennis displayed by freshman Roddey, who defeated Lindsey, of Wofford, in straight sets. This was Roddey’s first appearance on the varsity as he has not been eligible in previous matches. Brown won the other singles victory for Davidson, defeating Nettler in straight sets. Captain McCutcheon lost to Shuler after three exciting sets, and Chipley won out over McAlpine in the odd set by a 9-7 margin.

In the doubles McCutcheon and Carr, state champions, maintained their unbroken string of victories by defeating Shuler and Lindsey. After dropping the first set Nettler and Chipley, of Wofford, made a brilliant rally to defeat Brown and McAlpine and tie the match. The summary of the matches is as follows:

Singles: Shuler (Wofford) defeated McCutcheon (Davidson), 8-6, 2-6, 7-5. Roddey (Davidson) defeated Lindsey (Wofford), 6-1, 6-2. Brown (Davidson) defeated Nettler (Wofford), 6-4, 6-4. Chipley (Wofford) defeated McAlpine (Davidson), 6-3, 3-6, 9-7.

Doubles: McCutcheon and Carr (Davidson), defeated Shuler and Lindsey, 8-6, 6-0. Nettler and Chipley (Wofford), defeated Brown and McAlpine, 3-6, 9-7, 6-2.

The Lamar Society of Millsaps College at its meeting had for its discussion the matter of holding hands at that institution because the exes Vena Deae of this sport that is being done by the students of that co-ed institution. After a prolonged session of argument and testimony, lasting until just before dawn, a bill was passed which authorized the faculty of Millsaps College to hire several old maids to supervise the campus and prevent hand playing parties. The one who was selected to present the bill, and presented in the right manner at first, could not stand the strain and later broke down and confessed that he was

PLAYING THE GAME
By Caldwell Withers

With track season over and only two more varsity baseball games, the spring sport schedule is about coming to a close. The Wildcat baseball nine plays Duke in Gastonia next Saturday in a game which will have quite a bit of bearing upon the championship of North Carolina. Davidson athletic teams did not fare so well during the past week: Carolina ran away with the state track meet up at Raleigh, but this was to be expected judging from the previous performances of all the entrees. Davidson scored 22 points to place fourth. Losing to the Guilford Quakers in a Winston-Salem feature game, the Wildcats started their Virginia trip in a rather inauspicious manner. But the sandlotters redeemed themselves the next day by trouncing the strong V.M.I. nine. Captain Alford and his wrecking crew broke even in the remaining games; dropping a contest by a top-heavy score to W. and L. and winning from Roanoke by a 10 to 1 count.

Goodykoontz lived up to predictions in the State meet. This West Virginia sprinter ran third to McPherson and Sides in the century, was only a few inches back of the former in the 220, and raced across the tape first in the quarter. Hamp Jennings broke the college record in the pole vault when he took first place at 11 feet against the best vaulters in the state. Jennings has shown good form in all the meets he has entered and has been improving constantly. We are looking for him to give O'Dell, of Clemson, a race for honors next spring.

Wofford presented a stronger tennis team than had been expected in tying Davidson last Saturday. Last year Wofford was champion of the Palmetto state but lost several good men by way of graduation. However, Captain McCutcheon and Carr continued to win their doubles matches and ran roughshod over Shuler and Lindsay. Roddey, a freshman and backbone of the fresh team, played number two match in the singles and succeeded in beating Lindsey in straight sets. This was the first time that a freshman had played on a Davidson varsity team in two years. All the more honor to Roddey, who formerly held the Southern Junior championship in singles.

securing three hitsPast week the freshmen have played three baseball games, two of which they have won. N. C. State fresh and Monroe High were the teams defeated by them, while Wake Forest fresh came out on top with the larger score. By scoring three runs in the ninth inning of their game with State, the freshmen carried it off by a one-run margin. Murray did the best work with the stick for Davidson, in five times at bat. Harper got two out of four trips to the plate. McClure easily lasted the whole game, striking out 12 men. On Saturday, after scoring only one run in five innings, the fresh pounced on the ball and scored seven runs in one inning. Monroe High, their opponents, was held scoreless till the ninth, when they pushed over their sole tally. The final result was 11 to 1. In their engagement with the Wake Forest fresh, they were not so fortunate, losing by the score of 10 to 7. Although the fresh tallied five runs in the eighth, it was not enough to overcome the lead of Wake Forest. James and Ratchford hit best for Davidson. The box score for the N. C.

We are looking for Davidson to have a powerful tennis team next spring. McCutcheon, Carr, and McAlpine, of the varsity; Roddey and Bob Crosland (it has been rumored that he is to return to school) would make a formidable net team. And then, too, there are other good men on both the varsity and fresh squads that can be counted on to make those mentioned hustle for a position.

The freshman baseballers had more success last week than did their varsity brothers. They triumphed over State fresh in a slugging contest and on Friday took Monroe high school for a ride. Baseball seems to be the only branch of athletics in which the fresh are even breaking the fifty percent line. Ratchford, McClure, Murray, Littlejohn, and others look to be good material for the varsity next year.
