The Davidson Wildcats men’s cross country team completed their 2009 season with a great finish at the Southern Conference Championship.
The 8k race was held on the grassy trails of the Elon University Intramural Fields in Greensboro, N.C. The meet
consisted of Davidson and the other ten teams in the Southern Conference. The Wildcats finished in 2nd place with a
score of 82 points, 38 points behind the victorious team from Appalachian State University. Even though the Wildcats were ranked
higher in the polls coming into the championship meet, Appalachian State was dominant, winning their 5th consecutive Southern Conference Championship.

“It wasn’t quite what we wanted, but our top guys competed very well today,” head coach Gary Andrew said. “We’ll
certainly build off this performance when we return to Louisville for regionals.” Even with these high expectations, Coach Andrew must
have been proud seeing his team finish the best-ever for the Davidson men’s cross country team at the SoCon Championship.
The Wildcats had previously finished no higher than third, last doing so in 1955. The other top-5 team finishers behind
ASU were the following: University of North Carolina-Greensboro (83 points), University of Tennessee-Chattanooga (109 points), and Elon University (134 points).

The Wildcats were led by Lance Harden ’10 and Ryan Hopkins ’12, who earned 1st Team All-Conference honors with their
3rd place and 8th place finishes, respectively. Harden ran the race in 25:05 and Hopkins followed him in 25:32. Following
Harden and Hopkins were: Tom Divinnie ’10 (15th/25:50), Charlie Schmitt ’11 (26th/26:27), Demetrios Pagonis ’13 (30th/26:32), Peter Bruton ’10 (34th/26:42),
Thad Sieracki ’12 (55th/27:26), Greg Marcil ’11 (56th/27:26) and Ian Tupper ’12 (63rd/27:40). There were a total of 87 runners
who participated in this year’s Southern Conference Championship. The Wildcats will return to action on November 14th when they compete
in the NCAA Southeast Region Championships in Louisville, Ky.

The Davidson Wildcats women’s cross country team also traveled to Elon University for the 2009 Southern Conference Championships. The Wildcats
finished in 5th place overall, but in doing so had three All-Southern Conference performers. “I am very proud of how
we ran up front today, being the only team to finish with three All-Conference runners,” head coach Jen Straub said.
“I think we have a lot to be proud of and a lot to build on in the future!” One
of those pieces to build on, Natalie Atabek ’13, finished 9th overall with a time of 18:58. With her impressive
performances this season, Atabek also garnered All-Freshman honors. The Wildcats' other two All-Conference runners were Danielle Ruggieri ’11 and Heather
Connaroe ’11 who finished 12th place and 14th place respectively. This race was against the other eleven teams that make
up the SoCon, so to finish 5th out of 12 teams was solid. Other top finishers for the Wildcats were:
Lauren Childs ’11 (36th/19:33), Jane Gay ’12 (39th/19:37), Sarah Cline ’11 (47th/19:51), Anna Stockamore ’12 (54th/20:02), Elizabeth Wilbur ’13 (55th/20:04)
and Caroline Gecker ’13 (69th/20:36). There were a total of 100 women who ran in the event. The top-5 team
finishers in the field included the following: Samford University (74 points), Elon University (75 points), Appalachian State University (83 points),
Furman University (93 points) and Davidson College (110 points). The individual title went to Appalachian State freshman Brittney Caudle who
ran the race in 17:47. The Wildcats will hope to build on their impressive showing when they head to Louisville,
Ky on November 14 for regionals.

The ’Cats had a double header this weekend, starting with a dual meet Friday afternoon against the Tribe of the
College of William and Mary. Both the men’s and women’s teams fell short of a win, losing 131-87 and 149-90,
respectively. Individual winners for the men’s team included Geoffrey Peitz ’12 and Drew Onken ’13. Peitz took the 200 IM
and 200 fly while Onken continued his first year domination with 2 wins in the 200 back and breast. Bryan
Droll ’11 also was an individual winner, claiming the 50 yard freestyle in a time of 21.96 seconds, swimming his
way to his first dual meet victory. For the women, Emily Castle ’11 made her career debut in the 200
yard fly. In her first attempt, Castle dominated the field, winning the race in a near school record time of
2:08.13. On the diving board, Kelsey Chisholm ’10 took home first in the 1 meter competition while teammate Linnea Buttermore
’10 claimed the 3 meter.

Davidson continued their weekend of competition with an away meet Saturday in Charleston, SC. The Wildcat Women snagged their first
season victory as they won the rival cat fight against the Cougars, 151-89. On the women’s side, head coach John
Young purposefully “challenged the team to demonstrate some versatility”. The Davidson men’s team nearly overtook the College of Charleston squad,
losing by only 12 points (124-112). Swimming their off events, the Wildcat women still swamAn impressive meet. Lindsey Martin ’11
swapped her standard sprint repertoire for a taste of the distance races. Martin dominated (per usual), claiming the 200 and
400 freestyles. Jessica Delgehausen ’11 swam her way to victory in the 100 free while Castle took the 50. Lauren
Kamperman ’12 made her debut in the 200 back, winning with a time of 2:29.67. On the board, Buttermore and
Chisholm took the 1 meter and 3 meter competitions. For the men’s team, Onken won another pair of events, dominating
both the 200 fly and breast. Curtis Chaney ’12, Droll, and Peitz all were individual winners, taking the 200 free,
50 free, and 200 back, respectively. The Wildcats return to competition this Saturday with a decision against NC State. Come

Cats’ SoCon Tourney hopes end with loss at UNC-Greensboro
ZACHARY ZIMMERMAN

Despite the amazing season and stellar play of Davidson men’s soccer this year, the team fell short when they dropped
two games back to back. After losing to No. 2 Wake Forest on Tuesday night and UNC-Greensboro on Saturday, Davidson
is effectively tied for fourth place in the SoCon. Unfortunately, their head-to-head tie with Elon puts them out of the
playoffs, where only the top four teams in the SoCon compete. On a positive note, Charlie Reiter ’10 has been
named to the Academic All-American Team for District 3.

Davidson fell by a score of 4-1 to Wake Forest University in Winston Salem, N.C. on last Tuesday night. Davidson
posted its only goal with 18 minutes left in the match when Alex Caskey ’11 scored off a free kick
from 25 yards out, putting it inside the top left corner of the goal. Chip Sanders ’12 made nine saves
on the night but it was not enough for Davidson.

Saturday night, things did not improve. Defensive pressure on both sides characterized the first half as UNC-Greensboro and Davidson went
into the half scoreless. Not until the 13:59 mark in the second half did either team muster a goal, when
UNC-Greensboro scored to take a 1-0 lead. Less than a minute later, Davidson answered when Josh Zipin ’11 chipped in
a cross from Mark Millard ’12 to even things up at 1-1. Failing to convert on many scoring opportunities, Davidson
fell after UNC-Greensboro added two more goals to the total on the night to take the match 3-1. Davidson’s record
declined to 10-7-0 overall and 3-4-0 in the SoCon.

Davidson faced off in their final match of the season on Tuesday night at Campbell University, winning by a score
of 5-2. The Davidson offense performed well in their last game, and hopes to carry that success into next season.
