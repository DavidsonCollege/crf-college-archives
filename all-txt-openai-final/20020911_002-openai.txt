daily activities (like going to school or going out with friends) you will want to ask for assistance.
- Talk to your friends, family, or teachers. Often the best way to feel better about something is to share your feelings with other people. You realize you are not alone and you can help each other. It is important that somebody knows how you feel. Identify at least one adult whom you trust to talk to when you are upset.
- Try different ways to express yourself. Talking with others helps but you also may feel like writing in a journal or doing a creative writing, music, or art project. Just doing the activity is often enough to make you feel better but it also may help to share your work with others.
- Don’t be surprised if you react differently than you expected. Lots of factors contribute to how we react to an anniversary. These can include how you felt at the time of the attacks, how close you were to the events or someone who was hurt or killed, if you have experienced another crisis since then, or if you are having difficulties in other areas of your life. What is important is to be aware of your feelings and not keep them inside.
Get help if you feel overwhelmed. While feeling sad or more anxious is normal during this time, feeling like you can’t cope is a sign that you need some help. Tell an adult immediately if your feelings are keeping you from your normal activities or make you feel panicked, hopeless or alone, out of control, or like hurting yourself or others. Also, pay attention to the reactions of your friends. Tell an adult if you are concerned about a friend who seems miserably distressed.
- Maintain your routine and be constructive. Sometimes simply going to a practice, engaging in a hobby, going to the movies, or reading a favorite book can make you feel more at ease. Let your teacher or parents know if the workload or pace is too much.
- Don’t watch too much TV coverage. The media is likely to highlight the anniversary with emotional coverage such as interviews with survivors and family members, stories about the terrorists, predictions of future attacks, and/or replays of the World Trade Center collapse. Watching this kind of coverage can raise your anxiety level unnecessarily, particularly if you are not learning new or helpful information.
- Take care of yourself. We have a tendency to ignore our health when we are dealing with strong emotions or the demands of school. Be sure to get plenty of healthy food, exercise, and sleep. Limit your caffeine and junk food. Listen to relaxing or favorite music. Go for a walk with a friend. Your school may organize a memorial activity to help students and teachers express their emotions related to the anniversary. These activities can help you feel less vulnerable or alone and be a positive step in moving on. Emphasize the positive things about the people and events you are remembering such as favorite memories, the importance of family, a stronger sense of community, and a greater appreciation for our freedoms. It is okay if you don’t want to be part of a memorial activity, and you should not feel pressured to do so.

Let your By KATHRYN WYLE Staff Writer You are living in a Federal Disaster Area. Perhaps the lush green lawns on campus have led you, like many, to dismiss North Carolina’s much-discussed drought as something not so important and certainly not worthy of any more coverage. It’s just water—the stuff you ask for at a restaurant when feeling cheap and unwilling to actually pay for a drink. How valuable can it be? As is often the case, it takes the absence of a thing for anyone to notice its presence. At present, according to the New York Times, North Carolina is in the midst of the third worst drought in recorded history, outranked by only the infamous Dust Bowl of the 1920s and a similarly devastating drought in the 1950s. Cumulative rainfall over the past four years has left the region short of 40 inches, or one full year’s quota of precipitation. The shortage of rain is aggravated by the increase in urban sprawl. Columnist Douglas Jehl reports that in Charlotte alone, the number of water users has increased 36 percent in the past ten years, while the daily water use has increased by 56 percent. In the early summer, Governor Mike Easley called for the citizens of North Carolina to limit their water use by watering lawns at night and reducing car washing. The water shortage continued and, in August, Mecklenburg County upgraded from voluntary to mandatory water restrictions. According to physical plant director David Holthouser, Davidson and the surrounding Charlotte area are in level I mandatory restrictions. Level I, the lowest level of restrictions, calls for all watering to be done between the hours of 9 p.m. and 4 a.m. Holthouser said Davidson put all of the timed sprinkler systems on night watering in April. Students who were on campus this summer may have noticed daytime watering nonetheless. Holthouser points out that not all grassy areas have automatic sprinkler systems. Newly planted areas and frequently trafficked routes often receive water from moveable sprinklers. Because there is no nighttime grounds staff to transport, set up, and monitor the sprinklers, crews were forced to water these areas by day. Now, with a larger school year staff, and under the tighter restrictions, the sprinklers are set up by day but turned on at night by a custodian after 9 p.m. Holthouser worries about the effects of an increase in water limitations. For example, if Mecklenburg County moves up to level II restrictions, lawn watering will be permitted only once per week. This could spell disaster in particular for the athletic fields, which require special attention to survive their daily abuse. In a worst-case scenario, level III restrictions would completely prohibit all non-essential outdoor use of water. According to information from Charlotte-Mecklenburg Utilities, violations of the restrictions can lead to fines of $30 to $100 per day. Maintaining the grounds’ verdant appearance is far from the only use of water on campus. Besides independent student use, water is a vital component in providing air conditioning, cooking, dishwashing and, of course, the cherished laundry.
