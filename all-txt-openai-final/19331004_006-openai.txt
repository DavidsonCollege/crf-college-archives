THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER 4, 1933

Bulldogs marched over Erskine to the tune of a 25 to 0 score. The Citadel line was a stone wall
on defense, and Quarterman, Faulkner, and Ferguson, leading the offensive attack, outplayed the Flying Fleet at every turn.

William and Mary, against a more powerful enemy, still put up a stubborn fight, battling for every inch, and forcing
Navy to go to the air to tally, the final score being Navy 12, William and Mary 0.

The strong Emory and Henry aggregation, who last week showed up so well in beating V. M. I. 20 to
0, came to the front again in stopping another of Davidson's 1933 opponents, the Elon Christians, by a score of
24 to 0.

PORTER HAS ZOOLOGY COURSE AT BEAUFORT

Most of the crowd stayed at the boarding house and we managed to get enough to eat—even at the very
low rates charged. Besides, there were numerous young ladies who were only too glad to have an occasional dinner guest.

Members of the class were Daffin, Dolan, Gatewood, Herman, Hodgin, Hurst, Hutaff, Lucas, Tomlinson, Pope, Herring, Stevens, Gee, and surprise,
surprise—a Co-ed—Miss Elizabeth Huntley of Beaufort and N. C. C. W.—very excellent company, according to Hodgin, and lastly, and I’m
afraid least, yours truly, the assistant, whose largest task was waking up the gang every morning in time for breakfast.
Honest, it was the best vacation I’ve ever had, and I’m sure that goes for the rest of the crew.
And it’s pretty well agreed that we learned a lot of Zoology, too, you bet.

Of course, there were classes, two of them every day that we weren't out on a trip, but they were
rather informal and really interesting to anybody with a bit of concern about living things. There was a regular laboratory
period, too, for dissections, but at least a third of these were spent on field trips such as mentioned above.
Several of the class periods were given over to talks by the research workers at the government lab, including one
very interesting moving picture of the life history of the common oyster, Ostrea Virginica, to his friends.

(Continued from page 5)

They show a good fighting spirit, however, and their strength is not to be totally disregarded.

On Friday, The Citadel served notice to future opponents that it could still make a serious threat, as the Bulldogs
marched over Erskine to the tune of a 25 to 0 score.
