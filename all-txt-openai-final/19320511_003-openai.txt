THE DAVIDSONIAN, MAY 11, 1932

VARSITY-DUKE ON TENNIS COURTS TODAY

THE SPORTS PARADE

BELMONT ABBEY VS. FRESHMEN TODAY

The subject of our Tales this week, dear readers, is none other than Davidson's dash star, Fred Fleagle. Perhaps you've
wondered why his name hasn't crashed into this column before. Well, all we have to say is that it’s not
news if a dog bites a man, but if it happens the other way around, it is news—as you've no
doubt heard before. So has it been with Fleagle. Davidson's bit of “greased lightning” had been coming in first in
both the 100 and 220-yard dashes in most of Davidson's track meets, and consequently it failed to be news when
Fleagle won. But at the State meet held at Chapel Hill Saturday, Fred was nosed out by Carolina’s Farmer, who
has been traveling over those very same cinders for several years, in both the 100 and 220-yard events.

“Monk” Younger and “Tex” Tilson, who coached Davidson’s athletic teams for the past ten years, are back in town after
five weeks of spring football coaching spent at V. P. I., where the two are to assume regular duties next
fall. The two former Wildcat mentors will remain in Davidson with their respective families until the latter part of June
when “Monk” will go to Camp Carolina and “Tex” to Camp Mitchell as directors.

Coach “Doc” Unger is pleased with the spirit shown by the members of this year’s Freshman wrestling squad who have
been reporting for the night workouts he is conducting. However, the wrestling coach expressed regrets that members of this year’s
varsity have not shown enough interest to report regularly. Unger considers his chances of putting a winning team on the
mat next year great only if he can get full co-operation from members of both this season's squads.

All of Davidson’s athletic teams, with the exception of the tennis representatives, will bring their campaigns to a close for
the year this week. The varsity baseball team is in Durham today, engaging the Blue Devils for a return game.
Tomorrow the curtain will be dropped when the Wildcats play Wake Forest there. The Freshman baseball team, after meeting Belmont
Abbey here this afternoon, will entertain Wake Forest Freshmen at Richardson Field Friday in its last game of the season.
The undefeated Freshman tennis team will journey to Hickory to meet the high school netmen of that city Thursday in
its final match. The varsity netmen meet Duke University here today, but will not close its season until next week
when Furman University visits Davidson for a return engagement.

Davidson’s Freshman tennis representatives, captained by “Skip” Brown, have enjoyed the most successful season of any athletic team on campus.

Wildkitten Leaders Show Batting Slump

Although they slumped greatly during the last three games, batting leaders of the Freshman nine still had enough points left
to retain their top positions. Morgan lost 52 points during the week, but continued to lead the Wildkitten hitters with
an average of .481. Morris, regular first baseman, dropped from .467 to .372 but failed to lose possession of second
place. Johnny Mackorell, shortstop, showed the greatest increase by getting six hits, three of which were good for extra bases,
in twelve times at bat, to bring his average from an even .300 to .357, and fix himself in third
place. Mackorell also scored three times to take the lead in this department from Bumgardner, who failed to tally. By
hitting a homer, triple and double during the week, Mackorell pulled away from Morris, who connected for a home run
for his only extra base blow, for highest number of extra bases.

Wildkittens Lose Games To Three Big Five Foes

Davidson's Freshman baseball team suffered defeats at the hands of three Big Five yearling nines on an invasion into the
eastern part of the state last week. Carolina Freshmen crushed the Wildkittens, 12 to 4, in the first game of
the trip. Errors and inability to hit the offerings of Lewis and Childress brought Davidson's downfall. After permitting the visitors
three runs in the second inning, the Tar Babies came back in the third to score nine times and clinch
victory. Zaiser of Carolina led the hitting with two homers, a triple and a single in four times at bat,
while Morgan and Mackorell of the Wildkittens followed close behind.

Davidson: 030 000 010 - 4 9 5
Carolina: 009 000 03x - 12 13 2

WAKE FOREST WINS, 8 TO 6

In its second game, the Wildkittens got the jump on Wake Forest Freshman nine, but were unable to hold their
lead, allowing the Baby Deacons to come from behind and win by an 8-6 score. Six errors by the Davidson
team contributed to the Wake Forest victory.

BLUE IMPS VICTORIOUS

Duke University’s yearling team took the Davidson Freshmen into camp in the latter's final game of the trip by a
6-3 score. Walch, of the Blue Imps, pitched a steady game, allowing only five hits.

State College Baseball Teams Defeats Davidson

Wildcats Tie Score in Ninth Only to Lose Out in Tenth Inning

Friday, May 6, the baseball nine of the North Carolina State College met and defeated the Davidson varsity on Richardson
Field. The game was tied through the ninth inning, and the visitors counted out three runs in the tenth to
win the game, 5-2.

Both Pearce and Lanning pitched very good ball for their teams, the former allowing only six hits and the latter
five. Pearce struck out six men during the game and Lanning struck out three. The main part of the scoring
of both teams came from the many errors committed during the game.the game, Davidson took advantage of two errors and
a single in the ninth to even the score at 2-2, and then State took advantage of two errors, a
walk, and two singles to make the three extra runs that won the game 5-2. Ebey and Duke for the
visitors, and Brad- sher and Morrison for Davidson counted two hits apiece for a total of eight out of the
11 made during the game. The game was very interesting throughout, as can be seen from the score, and there
was a great deal of excitement in the extra inning when State scored three runs.

Athletes Compete for Sigma Delta Psi Trophy

The competition for the Sigma Delta Psi trophy and also for membership in this fraternity started Monday, May 9. Sigma
Delta Psi is an honorary athletic fraternity in which membership is awarded only to those who can pass a required
number of tests, proving their athletic prowess. The chapter at Davidson was founded in 1929, and since that time only
15 men have been awarded membership in the fraternity. A great number of students have passed a few of the
tests, and Coach Whittle, in charge of the tests here, has expressed his opinion that many men will pass the
remainder of their tests this year. He also expressed the hope that a great number of Freshmen will try this
competition so that new material will be found in the different branches of athletics covered by these tests. These tests
are being held on the athletic field and in the gymnasium, and will continue until examinations start. They cover all
branches of field events and a few tests of gymnastic ability, and are very helpful in forming and keeping a
strong body.

The officers in the local chapter of this fraternity for the past year are: R. E. C. Roane, president, and
John Creech, secretary and treasurer. The officers for the coming year were elected last week and are: John Creech, president,
and John O'Keefe, secretary and treasurer. Of the 15 men that have joined this fraternity since it was installed at
Davidson, 10 are in school now. The man who makes the highest score in all events and qualifies in all
of them is awarded the Sigma Delta Psi trophy, which is a handsome silver trophy and something well worth working
for. The events and their qualifications are:

1. 100-yard dash—11.6 seconds.
2. 120-yard low hurdles—16 seconds.
3. 1-mile run—6 minutes.

Five Old Records Fall As North Carolina Wins State Track Supremacy

Fleagle Stars for Davidson, Pushing Farmer, Carolina Ace, in Both Sprint Events

Five new North Carolina collegiate track records were set last Saturday as an extraordinary group of athletes from this state
gathered at Chapel Hill for their last meet of the season. North Carolina easily took the meet with 81 points
to win the state championship for the twelfth consecutive time. Duke gave them the closest competition, coming second with 49
points, and Davidson came next with 25 points. North Carolina State had a score of 9, and Guilford trailed with
2.

Brownlee of Duke proved to be the sensation of the meet when he clipped off the low hurdles in the
remarkable time of 23.3 seconds. Leading the field by about 15 yards, he bettered the old state mark set by
him last year. According to many officials of the meet, it is the best time recorded anywhere in the country
this year. Farmer, a North Carolina flash, stepped the 220-yard dash in the exceptional time of 21 seconds flat. He
also won the hundred-yard dash in the good time of 9.8 seconds. In both events, Fleagle of Davidson showed up
well, coming in only a yard behind Farmer each time, and beating Brownlee, who is also noted as a sprinter,
in the century. Farmer led the varsity scoring for individual points by winning the 100 and 220-yard dashes for a
total of 10. Mullis of Carolina came next with 8 points, and Brownlee of Duke, and Higby of Carolina each
had 7. The 440-yard dash was a tense race in which Marland of Carolina edged out Fulmer of Duke, to
set a new mark of 49.4 seconds, beating the old record by a full second. New records were (Continued on

"ELECTRIC BULLETS"

The result of exhaustive wind-tunnel tests of trolley car models revealed that at speeds of 70 and 80 miles per
hour, 70 per cent of the total power was consumed in overcoming air resistance. Streamlining saves approximately 20 per cent
of the power. When the Philadelphia and Western Railway Company decided to replace its cars with faster and more efficient
equipment, it chose "electric bullets"—new streamlined cars—each powered by 4 G-E 100-hp. motors. The cars, constructed of aluminum alloy, with
tapered noses and tails, are much lighter in weight and capable of greater operating efficiency. In developing transportation apparatus, college-trained
General Electric engineers have conducted extensive tests to improve operating conditions. On land, on sea, and in the air, today's
equipment is safer, swifter, more dependable, and more comfortable.
