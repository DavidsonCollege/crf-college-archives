### New Housing Policy Limits Group Clustering
By ANDREA DIEDRICH

The Housing Office, in connection with the Dean of Students' Office, has formulated a new policy which will limit the
number of students from any one social group allowed to live in a dormitory, according to Director of Housing Bill
Bolding. In a letter to Bolding dated April 30, Dean of Students Will Terry wrote, “I believe we should not
allow any group to dominate a dorm.” The proposal that Terry outlined suggests allowing no more than 16 students from
the same social group in Knox, Akers, or Irwin dormitories and no more than 15 or 16 students from the
same social group on one hall in the other dormitories. Terry suggested this plan in reference to post-lottery room swapping,
but Bolding said it will be a permanent policy.

The controversy over this policy has resulted from the fact that it was not made public until after room choices
had already been made. According to junior Ross Sloan, who is a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, he and several
other fraternity brothers were denied housing in Knox and Irwin even though their lottery numbers were better than some people's
numbers who were placed in those dorms. They were not denied housing altogether; they were placed in rooms on 4th
Belk, which was one of their lower choices. Sloan said when he and his friends confronted Bolding, Bolding claimed that
going strictly by lottery numbers would have made Knox overwhelmingly dominated by SAE’s. According to Sloan, Bolding said he felt
it would be better to exclude all SAE’s from Knox rather than make a choice of which SAE’s to exclude.
Sloan said, “I think that is against the spirit of the lottery.”

Bolding explained that the policy was made because there have been problems with SAE’s in Knox this year and in
prior years, although he would not specify what those problems were. Bolding said that it was not necessary to limit
blocking with any other social group. He also insisted, “No clusters were broken up.” He said that an announcement of
the policy was not made prior to the lottery because he “did not realize that there would be an attempt
at such a large block cluster.”

Sloan said that Bolding and Terry did work with him and his friends, and thus far Sloan knows of four
SAE’s as well as himself who will be allowed to live in Knox next year. Apparently, some of the people
who were given housing in Knox would prefer not to live there.

Aside from the issue of group blocking, Bolding feels the long waiting list is the only other problem with this
year’s lottery. There are 70 men and 26 women on the list. Bolding feels one explanation for the long waiting
list is fewer upperclassmen opting to live off-campus. He said, “We are encouraging men who are far down on the
waiting list to seek housing off-campus, but we feel pretty confident all the women will be given on-campus housing.” He
said the Housing Office will work with the students on the waiting list over the summer until everyone has housing.

### ATC Allocates Funds To Student Organizations
By NELLE McCORKLE

The Activities Tax Council (ATC) announced $69,050 in allocations for student organizations at Tuesday's Student Government Association meeting. Calling approval
of the ATC proposal “one of the most important things the SGA does,” ATC Chairman Anne Miano fielded questions from
senators and publication heads about specific allocations. Following discussion, the senate voted 11-1 (with a negative vote from junior Jay
Gaither and an abstention from junior David White) to approve the ATC budget, contingent upon the President’s office subsidizing $1,500
for the Martin Luther King Lecture Series.

According to ATC rules, each student organization desiring inclusion in the ATC allocations must submit an itemized budget proposal for
the 1985-86 school year. The ATC, comprised of SGA officers Miano, Christie Johnson, and Louis Zbinden, and at-large members Martha
Yeide, Rob Vaughn, and Steve Baskin, examines each proposal. With the help of faculty advisors Dean of Students Will Terry,
Director of the College Union William Brown, Business Manager Robert Currie, Comptroller Robert Davidson, and P.E. Director Sterling Martin for
the Club Sports section of the budget, the ATC draws up a recommended budget, which must be approved by the
SGA. The purpose of the ATC, Miano said, is “to represent students’ money,” explaining that $50 from each student's...Tuition goes
toward the student organizations' budget. Quips and Cranks, the top-budgeted organization, received $26,000. This amount is $1,575 short of that
recommended by editor Peggy Pierotti. Miano said eliminating proposed salaries accounted for $900 of the budget cut. “All other positions
of responsibility involve salaries,” said Pierotti, “and it seems only fair that Quips and Cranks jobs should too.” She added,
“Because the job takes time, I feel there should be a salary.” Because of ATC cuts, Pierotti said she is
seeking a lower publishing bid. Davidsonian Editor John Gathings said of the $13,400 allocated for the newspaper, “I’m pleased with
it, and I think the ATC was very fair.” Gathings praised Miano and her committee for “logical” analysis of each
organization’s proposal. The literary magazine The Davidson Miscellany was cut from the budget. Continuing Editor, German Professor Julius Winkler, said,
“We hope to keep publishing with other sources of funding.” He added that student interest in the publication has waned
in recent years. Therefore, he said The Miscellany did not submit a budget proposal for 1985-86, although the magazine received
$3,200 in ATC funds in 1984-85. Also eliminated from ATC allocations, The Unknown Fellowship (TUF) will receive its funding from
the Staley Foundation, a trust established for Davidson religious groups. This funding will be directed through College Chaplain Charlie Summers’
office, Miano said. SGA President Beadsie Woo called the $4,800 SGA allotment “fine,” adding, the ATC “did a wonderful job.
Anne Miano was fantastic.” The 1985-86 allocation represents a $700 decrease from (continued on page 3).

Deans Ross And Griffith Expect New Appointments
By DAVID VAN PELT and TED WILSON

The Trustees are expected today to approve John Griffith as new vice-president of development and Associate Dean of Students Sue
Ross as the new Registrar, according to Assistant to the President Rick Love. Vice-President of Development Jack Powers resigned April
30, and Registrar Richard Burts will retire at the end of the school year. Powers will assume a position at
St. Andrews Presbyterian College beginning June 1. Burts will continue to live in Davidson. Ross and Griffith would not comment
on the new positions or their successors until they are made official with the Trustees’ approval. Powers said he decided
to leave because he has attained his goals in the office. The fundraising program he organized “is moving along at
a six-million dollar yearly rate,” he said, and the endowment fund has exceeded its goal of 35 million dollars. The
fund now contains 49 million dollars. According to Powers, major developments during his tenure include improvements in the communications program
and printed publications. “We made a lot of renovation with the Davidson Update and started an annual report comparable to
a corporation's annual report.” He added the Alumni office has also been improved. “We reorganized the Board of Alumni Association
to make it more of a working group than it was before.” Burts said he made his decision to retire
last fall after twenty-four years at Davidson, ten as Dean of Students and fourteen as Registrar. He said he plans
to remain active in the Davidson College community, though he will “refrain from any interference” in Ross’ actions as Registrar.
Burts said he is unaware of any changes planned for the Registrar's office following his departure. Burts cited increased computerization
as the most important development during his years as registrar. Though the registrar's office used computers before he took office,
he said “now we are fully computerized.” Another development the computerization has made possible, Burts said, is a revision of
the registration process to make more classes available to incoming freshmen. Burts said he has also refined the self-scheduled exam
procedure that the registrar’s office controls. Burts said he has no consuming hobbies to pursue during his retirement. “I've lived
my work,” he said. Burts said he eagerly anticipates participating in College functions that his work made impossible. Love said
Kuykendall's choice of Ross and Griffith for the vacated positions has been approved by the Faculty Executive Committee. Love said
the Trustees must also approve the nomination.
