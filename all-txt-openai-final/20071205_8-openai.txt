### Environmental Hypocrisy

We at The Davidsonian confess that we are not the most environmentally-conscious people. If we’re being honest with ourselves, we admit that we are not truly on the “green” bandwagon. And it’s not just us. In light of such happenings as the poor attendance at the waste audit, the campus at large should more honestly consider what it is doing to conserve resources.

Recently, the administration, as it has every year since we've been here, decided to give every student on campus a directory with the theme “Go Green.” The only thing green about the student directories, though, are the covers. If the administration really wanted to “go green,” it would not publish information that is better provided online, or it would cut the amount of wasted paper in half by giving a directory to each roommate pair. Or, it could even allot one directory per hall. At the very least, the administration should have distributed the directories four months ago so that students could get at least a year’s use out of them.

It’s not just the dissemination of information that affects the environment. Social life can be a threat, too. For example, we need kegs on the Court. Seriously. The number of aluminum cans and Solo cups that we throw away on the Court each weekend probably accounts for at least 10 square miles of the rainforest. If the College wants to keep the campus keg-free, then what about placing big recycling bins in prominent places in the houses and down in Martin Court? (This would also help to eliminate the post-weekend trash heaps on the ground.) Really, having recycling bins at Court parties is at least as important as the mandatory untouched stale crackers.

And then there’s Christmas. The decorations on Patterson Court (and the ones soon to appear in the dorms) induce happiness, but the holiday lights are a huge energy drain (especially when left on throughout the day). Now, we’re not saying that no one should decorate for the holidays. We actually encourage holiday decorating for its depression-combating properties. What we are saying is that it is pretty ironic for a campus to spend a month “Doing It in the Dark” to make itself visible from space the next month.

While we as individuals and an institution may be good at making obvious changes—like not watering the grass during a drought and running environmental awareness weeks—we need to consider and reconsider what it really means to “go green.”

### Letters to the Editor

#### Chidsey Strives to Improve Relations with Farm Workers

The letter you published on Nov. 14, “Chidsey should retract statements,” unfairly dismisses Burger King Corporation’s serious and important commitment to worker dignity and continues the Coalition of Immokalee Workers' public relations “gotcha” game that does nothing to improve the lives of farm workers. I stand behind all the comments I made in answering the questions regarding the CIW and farm workers and invite anyone who doubts our integrity to be in touch with me directly. The Davidson Honor Code was and continues to be an important part of my life. We are committed and have proven that we are ready to work with any group serious about improving the lives of the tomato harvesters. It is unfortunate that the CIW has publicly dismissed our positive intentions because it is not what they want. BKC wants and continues to make positive improvements in the lives of these farm workers. We continue to uphold our strict vendor code of conduct, offer retraining opportunities, and provide charitable contributions to reputable organizations—all of which has an immediate and direct positive impact on these farm workers and their families. Let’s stop the public relations war and focus on what the farm workers want: a fair wage, a safe place to live and work, and a better life for their children.

Chief Executive of Burger King

#### Teach for America: An Unforgettable Experience

[Text not provided]America is the best thing that ever happened to me. I absolutely loved my experience at Davidson—it was those four years that gave me the opportunity to really figure out who I am and what matters to me. It was the first time that I truly became comfortable in my own skin. My years at Davidson were also incredibly significant in building my leadership skills. Teach For America has picked up right where Davidson left off. As a middle school special education teacher in a low-performing school in a low-income community in Charlotte, I began a career that allows me to act with passion and purpose each and every day of my life. This position provided me the opportunities not only to impact the lives of the students in my classes but to impact the lives of hundreds of students throughout my school by choosing to take on multiple leadership positions in my school. As a teacher, I was also a role model, an advocate, a coach, a counselor, and a social worker. I got to know my students’ families, the communities in which they live, and the intricacies of the public education system in Charlotte. I was able to develop myself as a leader and motivator of both children and adults. I gained insight into the factors contributing to the education gap and what actions can successfully close the gap. My work with Teach For America has led me to view our nation in a different light and set high expectations for the impact of my work for years to come.

Liberal media compromises election debate

Inconsistency is a cornerstone of the liberal media. The recent controversy surrounding CNN and its YouTube Republican debate only serves as the most recent example. Before I comment on that debacle, the debate itself must be given attention. What is the YouTube format? Regardless of the questions or questioners, I find using YouTube to help frame the debate an oversimplification. CNN claims that using YouTube is a hip, exciting way to discuss presidential politics in the Internet age. The presidency should be the farthest thing from hip. Deciding who has the power to launch nuclear weapons, deploy soldiers, defend borders, or appoint a Supreme Court Justice is a very serious matter. “Hip” should be avoided when discussing national security or Constitutional rights. These presidential debates should be a chance for deep scrutiny of the candidates. If I were in charge of the debates, my goal would be to make every candidate present their campaign as candidly as possible. Campaigning’s exterior needs to be stripped away to reveal the true candidate. None of the debates have done this. Candidates need to be called out, forced to state positions, and to clarify explicitly. So far neither CNN, Fox News, nor MSNBC have done this. For example, the moderator should phrase questions such as: “Governor Huckabee, you claim to be a fiscal conservative, yet by the end of your second full term, Arkansas’ sales taxes were 37% higher than when you took office. How does this support your claim?” Or, “Senator Edwards, you speak of a ‘Two Americas’ and you fight to create ‘One America.’ How does your net worth of over 30 million dollars factor into this?” Either way, the debates will never ask similar questions. These hypothetical questions direct us towards the questions and questioners participating in the Republican YouTube Debate. Apparently, CNN’s vast resources were unable to do what a few bloggers achieved in a matter of moments: expose questioners as supporters of Hillary Clinton, John Edwards, and Barack Obama. I find it hard to believe that the questioners were still undecided Republicans when they openly support Democrats. Now, these unknown individuals pose a huge problem for CNN. If CNN denies any previous knowledge of the questioners’ Democratic ties, what does that say about CNN’s journalistic capabilities? How can it possibly be trusted to report on anything? If CNN admits it was aware of the Democratic ties but ignored them to ambush the Republican candidates, then it only affirms what everyone knows: CNN = Clinton News Network. While it is still highly unfeasible CNN will get away with denying knowledge of the random YouTubers, the presence of retired Brigadier General Keith Kerr is another matter. CNN not only let him ask a question on YouTube and flew him to Tampa from California to be in the audience, it actually gave him the microphone during the debate. CNN was clearly trying, and failed, to embarrass the candidates. First off, Kerr’s question addressed the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy. It is a well-supported policy throughout the military and was first implemented by Bill Clinton. How this is a hot-button conservative issue in line with terrorism, Iran, North Korea, porous borders, or massive government, I have no idea. The story of Kerr does not stop there. Mr. Kerr supported John Kerry in 2004 and is currently a member of one of Hillary Clinton’s steering committees. CNN claims to have zero knowledge of this. In such an age of information, I doubt this claim.
