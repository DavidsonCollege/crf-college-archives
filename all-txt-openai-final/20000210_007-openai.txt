THE DAVIDSONIAN

On Friday, February 4th, 45,000 lbs. of white boiling potatoes from Maine arrived in the Baker parking lot destined to be bagged and distributed to local food banks, shelters, and residents. The activity, which started at 10 in the morning and lasted until 1 PM, was sponsored by Into the Abyss 2000 and the Society of St. Andrews Gleaning Network.

The Society, founded in 1987, links up communities with agricultural surplus all across the country in an effort to use what would otherwise be wasted to feed the hungry and less fortunate. Approximately forty members of the Davidson College community participated in the event.
