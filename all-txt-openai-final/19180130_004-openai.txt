DR. C. ALPHONSO SMITH.

Among the well-known alumni of Davidson College, and one who is making a name for himself in the literary world, is Dr. C. Alphonso Smith, head of the Department of English at the U. S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, Md. Dr. Smith was born in Greensboro, N. C., May 28, 1864, the son of Rev. J. Henry and Mary Watson Smith. He received his college education at Davidson, graduating in 1884 with the degree of A. B., and with the degree of M.A. in 1887. He also holds the degrees of Ph.D., received at Johns Hopkins University in 1893, and that of LL.D., conferred by the University of Mississippi and the University of North Carolina. Dr. Smith was instructor of English at Johns Hopkins University from 1890 to 1893, and was then professor of English at Louisiana State University until 1902. In that year he became professor of English at the University of North Carolina, later becoming head of the English Department of that institution. From here he went to the University of Virginia, to become Edgar Allan Poe Professor of English. A yearor two ago he resigned from this position to accept the chair of English at the U.S. Naval Academy. Dr. Smith is an author of note, having written a number of books on grammar and literature. Among the best known of these are “The American Short Story,” “What Can Literature Do for Me?” and “O. Henry.” He has been associated in the editing of such volumes as “The Library of Southern Literature,” and is a contributor to well-known periodicals and literary magazines.
