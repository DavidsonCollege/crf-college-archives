**Sacrifice is critical to save the environment**
*Jay Barron*

I saw Ricky Rudd on TV last Saturday (famous auto racer, for those of you who aren’t really in touch with southern culture). Ricky was standing in front of his mobile billboard (fans call them “stockcars”) pitching for Pennzoil. Ricky was telling me that the oil he puts in his car is the same oil I can buy for my car for TOP performance. Golly. I thought, you mean I could drive my car at outrageous speeds for hours on end for no apparent good reason too?

My apologies to any big Rudd fans, but at a time when our atmosphere is telling us to reevaluate our historic love affair with ozone-bashing, good ol’ Ricky has, in my mind, innocently and unwittingly come to represent the senselessness of our zeal for waste. Our world is dying, but we refuse to concede that our 20th-century fossil-fuelish (remember that word?) lifestyle has anything to do with it. Auto racing is not the lone culprit, and pollution/ozone depletion certainly isn’t something America alone should be blamed for. But if the summer of ‘88 wasn’t a slap in the face for everyone, then we are surely in for real environmental catastrophe.

OK, so maybe this isn’t news to you, but now that the weather is cooling off, have we postponed our concern, just like we did after the oil embargo of the seventies (I think a few people were using the word “fuelish” then, too...)? Are we still treating environmental damage like a minor problem, maybe even saying it was just a fluke summer? If you drive to the post office, you sure as hell (last summer) are. Cartoonist Gary Toles recently penned “it’s not the heat, it’s the stupidity.” Stupidity in the ‘80s takes many forms: styrofoam cups, toxic waste dumped in the ocean, and driving a car when it isn’t necessary, to name a few.

I’m not so fanatical as to say “DON’T drive,” because our country, unfortunately, must drive. We are utterly dependent on cars and trucks to get to work, get our food, go out, and everything else we do. However, that doesn’t mean we can’t compromise until something more environmentally sound comes along, like public transit, chemical emissions alteration, or (heaven forbid) solar cars. Walking or riding a bike are two options that leap to mind. Neither is an answer, but they are realistic alternatives. The problem for most people is that they would require a change in lifestyle and an inconvenience, and in the land of drive-thru’s and run-ins, that’s strictly taboo.

I think mountain bikes are one of the greatest fads ever to come to college. It’s fashionable to ride a bicycle again, thanks in part to these great big toys. I just wish more people were willing to spend 1/10th or 1/12th the price of a car for a bike. Tie-dyes and “friendship” bracelets demonstrate that we are slaves to the whims of fashion. I think adding bikes to that list is an encouraging example of “conservation-chic” (the next big thing???). MAYBE peer subtle-pressure could even get people to bring plastic “tumblers” and coffee mugs to the cafe as an answer to styrofoam cups (they work for tea, too). No, they won’t.

**For then, for now, and forever Dylan**
*David A. Thompson*

With tickets in our hands and stars in our eyes, we went “freewheeling” down “highway 51” in search of a time we thought lost. We were Charlotte bound last Saturday night for what we thought would simply be a dose of the past in seeing Bob Dylan in concert. The experience proved to be much more than a temporary analgesic for the ills of our time. What we saw instead was the importance and the power of an American hero; a legend who not only opened the eyes of the nation more than twenty years ago, but is still doing it today, in a time when his abilities are needed more than ever.

To expound on this idea, one could discuss how today’s world is so similar to that of years ago; how much the Central American situation of the ‘80s is so much like that of Southeast Asia of the late ‘50s, how the establishment stifles the young, and how Dylan showed us all how to be “free, man,” but I won’t. That would be trivializing the greatness of this man and his work. Bob Dylan has gone beyond all that sappy and nonsensical noise by dedicating himself to saying something which is worth our while to hear. While a great many of the “Peace, Love and Happiness” artists of the sixties have been forgotten, Bob Dylan remains an important figure in our world today.

Before rambling away any further on the eternal genius of Bob Dylan, I think it is necessary to discuss last Saturday’s concert and the various reactions to it. Yes, I will be the first to agree that the show had its flaws. I too would have liked the concert to go on longer than it did, and perhaps my beloved Bob could use a few guitar lessons, but I was still enormously pleased by the concert. These faults seem to me to be unimportant compared to the brilliance radiating from the man at center stage.

What bothers me, however, is the complaint I have either heard or overheard so many times since the show.

"Dylan didn’t even say anything. I can’t believe he wouldn’t even talk to the crowd.” I feel the bile rising in the back of my throat just thinking about it. I feel more saddened than angered, however, that this is the only impression so many people get from one of my personal heroes. I can’t help but think that these people missed the point of Dylan’s work if they left the performance feeling at a loss for celebrity small talk. What has set Bob Dylan apart from the masses of musicians and performers is that he has never pandered to the cotton candy contingent of our culture; the sort of people who like Dan Quayle because he looks so much like their favorite game show host. Rather than have his audience remember some snappy little anecdote (the sort for which David Lee Roth and the like are so famous), I think Dylan wants us to feel the meanings of his work instead.

Today Bob Dylan is still holding fast to his powerful, though often times upsetting message. He has kept his eyes open to our world and still warns us to do the same. Dylan, unlike so many others, does not offer us any sort of Utopia; he instead points out to us that which makes us what we are. Dylan displays an understanding of the good and the bad, not simply of society, but of human nature, a vastly deeper subject. His lyrics are eternal. “The times they are a-changin’” all right, and they always will. The answers to our most important questions have always been and will always be “blowin’ in the wind,” and it is only up to each of us to listen to that breeze. Yes, “there is something happening” and you had better find out what it is, for it won’t go away soon, nor will Bob Dylan. The man and his work will not be forgotten as long as there are people who can listen to music.

Eliminate styro production and use, but they would send a signal: that people are willing to swap a little convenience for a healthier environment. I don’t think anyone’s opposed to saving our atmosphere, but there’s a real lifestyle conflict involved. Let me draw a scholastic analogy: I don’t think anyone’s opposed to getting good grades, but unfortunately, a few late nights may have to be sacrificed along the way to succeed in this noblest of endeavors. If you’re really good, though, you can convince yourself that Sunday afternoon and night is enough time to research AND write ye olde ten-pager (ahem... “procrastination”). It may still work out, but Sunday’s going to be tough. Spreading it out, a little at a time, would (although few have tried it) make it easier, more thorough, and generally more successful, even if you thrive on pressure. If we were to start weaning ourselves away from cars and styrofoam, two environmental villains we use every day, Sunday might not be so bad. And woe unto the unbeliever, because Monday is most assuredly coming.

And what of Ricky Rudd, my scapegoat du jour? His job is probably safe for now, since stock car racing alone certainly can’t be blamed for the environmental convulsions we’re starting to feel. However, the longer we wait to indict him and every other fuel-monger (that’s you and me), the less likely it will be that our “under-the-weather” planet will be able to shake its fever.
