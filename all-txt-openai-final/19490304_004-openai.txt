With the co-operation of the Faculty Committee of Audio Visual Aids, le Cercle Francais will show the following program of
French films in the Science Building next Wednesday afternoon, March 9:

(1) Paris, the economic and cultural life of the capital, markets, stores, different “quartiers,” etc.
(2) Profil de la France, a comprehensive picture of French life from the north coast to the Pyrenees.
(3) Le Moulin Enchante, first-hand glimpses of the people and scenes of Provence.
(4) Nouveaux combats de la marine, reconstruction of French ports and shipping.
(5) Autour d'un clocher, the calm and industrious life of a French village.

The public is invited. There is no charge for admission. The same program will be given at Erwin Lodge during
the evening, when the Cercle Francais will have as its guests the advanced students of French from Limestone College.

The Forensic Council held its first debate of this semester at Agnes Scott last week-end. The council was participating in
a tournament of southern schools, and the topic of debate was "Federal Aid to Education." Nineteen schools were represented in
this contest.

The affirmative team from Davidson was composed of Jack Hunter and Flynn Long. This team won five out of seven
debates, winning over Auburn twice, UNC, U.S.C., and Sewanee. They lost twice to Alabama. This record enabled the affirmative to
capture third place in the tournament.

The negative team was composed of Don Shriver and Charles Davis. They were not as successful as their counterparts from
Davidson, winning only two debates.

Dear Editor,

It is true that there were several shocked students as the case may be, who wrote a letter to the
editor of the Davidsonian in which they used extremely derogatory remarks in attacking Mr. Farrior’s address and then didn't have
the courtesy to sign their name. What we are most concerned with is the fact that this letter, which carries
such a strong reminder of the elections in April, was published without any way of defending himself. Few will deny
that the horse and buggy couldn't have a telephone in the buggy.

Sincerely,
A Student

Plans were made to have a movie on France at the next meeting, plus a short discussion of the nation
by Guy Dardell.

ALL THE NEW POPULAR PHONOGRAPH RECORDS. Quantities of mustard and several hot dogs later, Harold Hipps, square dance caller, managed
to entice the advanced students from Duke and Lenoir Rhyne College next week-end to the Forensic Tournament. Later in the
evening, the Cercle Francais will have as its guests the advanced students of French from Limestone College.

Expecting to be confronted with at least the third degree from that redoubtable officer, our Davidsonians were relieved to find
only the preparations for a square dance. Swallowing their surprise, with true Davidson spirit, our heroes piled into the cars
provided and were swiftly conducted to no less a place than the rustic cabin of the Charlotte D. A. Quantities
of mustard and several hot dogs later, Harold Hipps, square dance caller, managed to entice the advanced students from Duke
and Lenoir Rhyne College next week-end to the Forensic Tournament. Later in the evening, the Cercle Francais will have as
its guests the advanced students of French from Limestone College.

Winston Churchill may visit America.Ri Fechor opines they will go to Mary Washington College to compete in a national forensic
tournament. He agrees with the opinion of a person who isn't convinced of his own convictions to the extent of
signing his article and subjecting himself to some sort of criticism. He has shown that silence is not always golden.

Supporting him was Red Williams, former Day in, now at the Dyke Divinity School. It seems that anyone who attempts
his best to counteract the efforts of the full-hearted Methodists in competition with the Presbyterians might reveal his identity to
the party or crowd criticized. They might discuss the matter in question with the critic and possibly reach an agreement.

Jimmy Jung, 127-pound captain, would be almost a sure bet for a league crown if it weren't for a hernia
which has sidelined him in several meets. However, he is still expecting big things from this fighting lightweight. Other masters
of the mat who will have a chance to take the big prize are Kelton, Raul Husted, 136-pound class; Mott
Price, 165 pounds; Alexander, and Moore.
