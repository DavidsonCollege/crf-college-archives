The Davidson soccer team challenged two tough ACC opponents last week, only to come up on the short end both times.

The University of North Carolina came in on Friday and finally wore the ’Cats down to win 3-2 in overtime. Davidson started very strongly, completely dominating the action.

“We played about the best soccer we could for thirty minutes of the first half,” said soccer coach Chip Stone. “We were passing well, playing great defense, and we were very creative on offense.”

Just minutes into the game, Billy Hawk took a tremendous pass from Joe Duncan and knocked it by the Tar Heel goalie to put Davidson in front. About five minutes later North Carolina tied the score.

Olaf Kampschmidt came up with the ball in a scramble in front of the Wildcat goal and managed to slip it by the goalie Bob Perz.

The rest of the half was all Davidson. The ’Cats put tremendous pressure on the Tar Heel defense and had many scoring opportunities. However, they could capitalize only once.

“That’s been our problem all season,” said Stone. “We seem too concerned about getting off a perfect shot instead of forcing the action.”

About halfway through the period, Paul Schleifer took a pass from D. C. Augustine and kicked the ball into the net for his second goal in as many games, giving Davidson a 2-1 lead at the intermission.

Both teams came out strong in the second half, but gradually the pace of the game took its toll on the Wildcats. North Carolina took control of the action and finally scored the tying goal with about ten minutes remaining in regulation.

The Davidson defense staved off the Tar Heels the rest of the half. Under a new NCAA rule, in the event of a tie game, two ten-minute overtime periods are played. Davidson came out quickly in the first period, but could not sustain the tempo.
