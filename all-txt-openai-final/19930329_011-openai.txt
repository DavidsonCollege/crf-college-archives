Women's Tennis Opens Conference Play With Win
By Will Cobb

The women’s tennis team is heading into Southern Conference play after several nonconference matches. Over spring break, the team traveled to Hilton Head for competition with Big East’s Georgetown and Seton Hall along with Southern Conference foe Marshall. The team then returned home to open their conference play against Georgia Southern. Head coach Caroline Price described the experience at Hilton Head: “The whole week was one of rearranging, rainouts, and rescheduling. I think we were on the lucky side because we actually played three matches.”

The ‘Cats defeated Georgetown handily by a score of 9-0. At number one singles, Jennifer Beahm came back after dropping the first set 6-0 to win the last two sets 6-4 and 7-5. The team then faced Marshall, winning handily 7-1. Beahm gave another outstanding performance, winning a hard-fought match 7-6, 6-7, 6-4 to lead the Wildcats in a match that did not count toward Southern Conference play, but gives the team confidence for their match later in the year. The team’s final match was against Seton Hall, where the 'Cats fell 5-4 for the team’s second loss of the season. Tasha Ruth and Barbara Grooms teamed up for the squad's only doubles victory with outstanding play. At number one, Cyndi Hess gave a super effort with an impressive victory over Seton Hall’s top player.

“The Seton Hall match could have easily gone either way,” said coach Caroline Price. “Because it was an intra-conference match, we had our number four doubles team in the number three spot and they lost a tough one in three sets. Then we had an injury substitution at number four singles, where Susannah Cobb played a very competitive match, but lost 6-2, 6-3.”

After break, the team opened its Southern Conference play with an easy victory over Georgia Southern, 7-2. The team’s record is now 7-2 on the season including a victory over Georgia Tech. From now until the end of the season, Davidson will play exclusively Southern Conference opponents.

Women's Lacrosse Makes History
By Robert Lloyd-Still

Wednesday, March 10 marked a historic event in the history of women’s athletics at Davidson. The women's lacrosse team played its very first match at the varsity level. On a spring break trip from New York, Cortland State came for a scrimmage. The ‘Cats played hard but fell to the more experienced Red Dragons by a score of 16-9. Last season the women’s lacrosse team played a club schedule. This year the competition will increase immensely because the ‘Cats will face all Division III opponents. The ‘Cats will even face Washington & Lee, a team ranked in the top twenty by many preseason polls.

In the match against Cortland State, Megan Snyder played extremely well for Davidson. Of the nine goals the ‘Cats scored, she managed seven of them. Davidson women’s coach, Betsy Brown, summed up the team's performance: “This was a great learning experience for both myself and the team. We didn’t play our best, but we did play well, especially for the first time out. We held our own against a very good team.”

Davidson is a very young team led by senior captain Jenny Plowright. After helping to revitalize the women’s basketball program for the last two years, Plowright will lead the ‘Cats in their developmental stages. The lacrosse team also expects big seasons out of freshmen Hedy Moolenaar, Anne Sutton, Amy Craigin, and sophomores Allison Adams, Nancy Hilles, and Liz Schaper. On Tuesday, March 30, Davidson students can catch their first glimpse of the lacrosse team when they face Greensboro College at 4:30 p.m.

In Davidson’s last tennis match, they jumped on the Spiders early by taking the doubles point and never looked back as the team coasted to a 5-2 victory. This win came after a defeat to the University of South Carolina, ranked 22nd in the nation. Davidson’s record now stands at 5-1 on the year. The ‘Cats looked stronger in the doubles than they have all year against Richmond. Russell Briggs and Ryan Harper earned a tough victory.

Wildcat Baseball Battles Opponents, Weather
By Will Cobb

As the baseball team reaches the season’s midpoint, it has realized how uncooperative weather can be. The team was only able to play six of its scheduled twelve games over break. And last week, the team only managed to play one game. The team has struggled of late and they continue to lose close games by one or two runs. Davidson lost five of their last six against such tough opponents as N.C. State (#10), Duke (#25), and Maryland.

Defense has caused many of the problems for the ‘Cats. They are at the bottom of the Southern Conference defensively with a .945 fielding percentage and 34 unearned runs. The ‘Cats have kept the bats swinging, averaging six and a half earned runs per game. Mac Chapman has led the team in hitting with a .377 batting average with sixteen RBIs and four home runs. Also having a great season is senior Tim Kerns, who has brought his batting average up to .371 while leading the team in RBIs with nineteen along with four home runs. The toughest hitter so far has been Brett Boretti, who in 69 at-bats, has been struck out only six times.

For the pitchers, junior Chris Carrigan has been a pleasant surprise, pitching 35 innings with an ERA of 4.33. Randy Spaw has a record of 3-2 in 41 innings with an ERA of 5.05. Another bright spot appears to be freshman Brian Krehmeyer, who has been given a considerable amount of playing time so far this season. He has a record of 1-1 in 21 innings with an ERA of only 3.92, while giving up 23 hits.

“We're still trying to find a set rotation,” said Coach Dick Cooke, “which we had hoped to do this week, but the weather didn’t cooperate. Still, we have a number of freshmen who have shown that they deserve some innings.”

The team stands at 3-5 in the conference, including a win over The Citadel, but was rained out at App. State and that game will not be rescheduled. The team’s next home game will be this Wednesday against Harvard at 3:00 p.m.

Attention: Each year at Spring Convocation, the Davidson Chapter of Omicron Delta Kappa, a national leadership fraternity, presents an award to a member of the Davidson faculty for excellence in teaching. Nominations for this award are made by Davidson students. Forms are available in the College Union, Library, and the Dean of Students Office. The deadline is April 2, at 5:00 p.m.
