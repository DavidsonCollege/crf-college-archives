My Dream Life
Gonna get
those punks.
Gonna
drive
them
into
dirt.

"No more fun of any kind"

When I heard those words, I nearly cried
for wishing

they were mine.

It's fun to bully students,
the faculty whines so much.
Boy, you know, I like hot fudge.

But I really am a decent guy, Smart, Funny,
A Leader.

I'm great,

just like I said

in the Journal,

Why won't they leave me alone?

Dingahs
I love to hit them dingahs,
and knock the crap outa 'em.

I love to hit them dingahs,
I really love it.

Baseball it been good to me,
I like it.
It is fun to play, and watch.

I really like to hit dingahs
and throw the ball and catch,

I like to wear my glove;
and I have a cap.

I like to hit a dingah. It feels good, like a the.

star, to be Duffy, Vince or Ozzy and merely puke, spit, or grab your
crotch on stage and have thousands of scantily-clad women shrieking
with utter delight. Reputation and image are it, and you must work at

them no matter what. As a sideline to this, I can offer a personal
experience. I was standing backstage at the Metal Awards of Miami last
year when I saw Ozzy Osbourne approaching. I began to walk to him to
say hello (because he is a friend) and he just started puking right there
in the hall. I saw my chance, picked up a plastic bag and collected his
vomit. Now, it sits in my room as a trophy to the wonders of metal. I
mean can anybody else say that they’ve actually put their hands in the
regurgitation of the master, Ozzy Osbourne?

Well, it's time to sign off for this week. Bang your head and pop in
some Tesla during exams and remember, screw that country and start
screaming aloud to the real artistic musical creation of this world: heavy
metal.

Do You Like:
Really Bad Poetry?
Leftist Propaganda?
Incomprehensible Cartoons?

Do you feel, to the very core of
your depraved, white,
guilt-ridden soul,
the urge to create?

TONGUE

is for you!

Jump on
the bandwagon soon,
before we run out of toner for the
Xerox!
