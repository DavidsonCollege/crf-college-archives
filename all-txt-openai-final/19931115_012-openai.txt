Fine dining without pretension
By Leigh Rawdon

Every American may find home in the Holbrook House restaurant in Huntersville—whether the Southern hospitality of your grandparents’ or the Northeastern charm of bed and breakfast. The restaurant features American regional cuisine with recipes collected from all over the states—New England Bog chicken, New Orleans steak, and San Francisco seafood. But the highlight of the meal is less the food than the “dining experience.”

When you walk in off the front porch, the host takes your coat. The hostess seats you and hands you the drink list. Once you order and are settled, a waitress with the hometown look of a Shoney’s server lists the specials of the day. The service is personal, proficient and the opposite of pretentious; it is almost an amusing satire of Southern helpfulness.

The food itself is as all American as the friendly service and decor. Even the ingredients are authentic with little European or nouvelle gourmet influences. Not even the wine or beer is imported. We had stuffed shrimp and a crab cake for appetizers and preferred the crab cake. For dinner we sampled the Saratoga chicken ($15.95—boneless breasts wrapped around a stuffing with balanced flavors of spinach, Swiss, and pecans, in a cream and sherry sauce), Cajun style swordfish and shrimp ($17.95—grilled in Cajun spices—but even the extra hot spices are very mild), and the skillet style orange roughy ($10.95—lightly floured fillet pan fried on a citrus herb sauce). Every entree was served with almost overcooked carrots or cheese-covered broccoli, and rice from a box. The entrees were definitely better than the side dishes. The orange roughy with citrus sauce took first place with our diners.

Ohh... the homemade desserts. We had the popular “toasted pearl” (a ball of vanilla ice cream, covered in a graham crust, fried, and placed in hot fudge and whipped cream); it tasted just like you’d imagine. We wished we’d had the peanut butter and chocolate torte, the fancy form of a Reese's peanut butter cup. The star, though, of the after-dinner show was the selection of coffees (an example—Bill Bailey’s Back—coffee with Bailey’s, whipped cream, and green Creme De Menthe), all made with the only American coffee, Hawaiian Royal Kona.

The atmosphere is intimate and romantic, complete with lace curtains, floral watercolors, candlelight, and 1940s elevator music. A fireplace, ceiling fans, and ferns make each room distinct and homey. A large room upstairs is ideal for a graduation party or a group before a date function. The trip to the restaurant is a short six-mile drive south on Main Street. It is located in a historic home built in the late 1800s by a prominent Huntersville family, the Holbrooks. Nine years ago, a corporation bought the abandoned structure; five years ago, the restaurant opened.

The southern serving staff, Detroit chef, and New York manager/owner each hold an equal amount of pride in Holbrook House, noticeable in the immaculate kitchen and great service.

Scott says
By Scott McLean

Celebrities seem to love combining their personal and professional lives by working on projects with their spouses. From Fred and Ginger to Kenneth and Emma, Hollywood has a long history of couples collaborating in the movies. The latest in this spousal smorgasbord o’ film is the Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid vehicle Flesh and Bone. Written and directed by Steve Kloves, the same guy responsible for The Fabulous Baker Boys, this flick is decidedly darker than his previous effort.

Set in Texas, the movie focuses on Arlis Sweeny (Quaid), a traveling vending machine supplier with a past. As a kid Arlis used to work a crime circuit with Daddy Sweeny (James Caan) that one night ended with the murder of an entire family except for a young girl. Trying to escape that memory and Daddy too, Arlis has kept on the move over the years eventually hooking up with Kay Davies (Ryan) who is trying to escape from something as well: a bad marriage. That’s not the only thing these two have in common. Kay’s had a traumatic past also—her parents were killed when she was a baby. Put two and two together here and you figure out that Kay is the girl who survived the murders that Arlis witnessed nearly thirty years ago.

years ago. If this weren’t complicated enough, things really take a turn when Daddy shows up with his crime protégé Ginny (Gwyneth Paltrow) to tie up loose ends. Though Quaid and Ryan have top billing in the film, the real stars are supporting actors Caan and Paltrow. Caan is great as the evil Daddy come back to reclaim his son and set things right that went wrong so many years ago. Paltrow is the movie’s zinger as the tart and sassy Ginny who makes her living conning folks and stealing from those who have recently passed on. Y’all keep an eye out for this girl ‘cause I have a feeling you’ll be seeing her again real soon.

Despite an excellent supporting cast, the movie lacked “oomph.” Cinematographer Phillipe Rousselot (A River Runs Through It) does a great job setting the tone of the picture, but it seems that Quaid and Ryan just can’t sustain the suspense. Dennis plows through the flick like a member of the living dead and Meg appears to be confused about how to portray her character. I think this couple needed to take a vacation instead of working on this picture, but that’s just my opinion. I’d say that Flesh and Blood just hasn’t got enough meat for the average viewer.

Greater Tuna has lots of laughs,
By Jacob Abraham

It seems that the more secluded and confined a region becomes, the more stereotypes develop concerning its inhabitants. And when the region is a backwoods town in the rural American South, the stereotypical citizens can be an almost endless source of hilarity — just think of all the “redneck” jokes you’ve ever heard. Greater Tuna makes no attempt to judge or comment on the stereotypes that have developed concerning the South; instead, the play extends those stereotypes to absurd proportions and then lets the audience enjoy the comic results.

While Tuna succeeds in drawing its share of laughter, it might work better as a satire if its jokes were complemented by some kind of storyline. Frank Jernigan and Myles Louria take on the formidable task of portraying the residents of an entire southern town by themselves, while using mime and vocal effects to create dogs, musical instruments, and even a Pontiac. Director Ronnie Higdon manages to carefully orchestrate the endless exits and entrances of various characters, while the two actors seem to shift effortlessly from one role to the next. With varying success, they juggle parts as diverse as two radio announcers, several half-crazy women, a preacher, a sheriff, and a number of snotty kids.

The intimacy of the Black Box Theatre makes the comedy very direct and effective, since the characters are right in front of the audience. The clever set serves as a radio station, a few different houses, a church, and other locales in Tuna, Texas. The props and lighting are equally inventive. For example, a spotlight is used to represent God when various characters say their prayers; also, two on-stage radios are used to play taped dialog while the actors change off-stage.

Louria comes off well as Stanley Bumiller, a rebellious, cocksure Southern boy. He also plays the funniest characters with less stage time, including Petey Fisk of the Greater Tuna Humane Society; Charlene Bumiller, a pudgy, frustrated cheerleader; and Phinas Bly, a nerdy, failed politician. Jernigan is best in drag, as Bertha Bumiller, a bossy, conservative mother, and Pearl Burris, an eccentric old lady who uses strychnine doggie biscuits to protect her chickens from neighborhood mutts. Perhaps if the actors had hammed it up a little more and made use of more dramatic movement and facial expressions, some of the other characters would have been funnier.

But the principal flaw of the production seems to lie in the play itself: in short, where’s the story? The only element of the play even resembling a plot revolves around Judge Buckner, whom Stanley kills by injecting air bubbles into his bloodstream to induce a stroke. The fact that Stanley gets away with murder helps to expose the incompetence of the sheriff; but the conflict surrounding the mysterious death could have been extended into a more substantial story. There’s certainly no shortage of wit in the characters, but after an hour or so, the show starts to feel like a lengthy, overblown Saturday Night Live skit, and the unsuccessful jokes begin to wear on the audience. Tuna is definitely good for a few laughs, and perhaps therefore accomplishes its goal as a comedy. But without any kind of plot development, the joke gets old, and the final scenes seem like filler material to round out the play.
