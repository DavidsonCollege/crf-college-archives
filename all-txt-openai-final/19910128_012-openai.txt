Cobb causes all the blood vessels in the body to widen, and more blood

FREDDIE: I'm swamped in work! When is spring break?

What is the benefit of college if all you do is wait for your next vacation? The semester has just
begun! Why don't you just enjoy the learning process?

They should lock you away in the Library of Congress and throw away the key. THAT'S what they should do
with you! You've lost it, and I'm not looking forward to spending a semester with a crazy man for a
roommate.

But Freddie, we just got back from our Christmas break...

Enjoy the process? I feel like I'm an indentured servant to academia. Enjoy the process - HA! You are one...

But hey, Big Cheese, too many 12-oz. curls and it's cash and given they'll be tweenie girls (sweet editorial, models
- and we thought you were simple, ha. Coulda fooled me.)

plane flights, since supposedly the flight itself already has some diuretic effect on the body. This coupled with a few
small $3 drinks, can lead to an especially bad hangover due to dehydration.

A warm feeling accompanying a “buzz” is misleading. In fact, alcohol does not warm you up, but it cools you
down. It causes all the blood vessels in the body to widen, and more blood to circulate in the capillaries
right below the skin. More deep body heat is transferred to the skin, and from there to the air. Because
of this, it is more dangerous to drink in cold weather than in warm weather.

So, be careful out there, and don’t pass out in the middle of the court. You’ll freeze!

(Ahem.) Don’t catch a random beer, man, get a clue.

Too late you're gonna notice she's the Date From Hell 'cause you were buggin’ the bowl! Ambitions fell. Now it's
Pas, Fable, Neg, NOT, Nada, no WAY~ (And it ain't been this bad since that fateful day that the pack
fell through on off-campus KA-)

I hate it for ya, you would-be stud. Take them 9°9 les off and nip it in the bud. 'Cause
you know it won't matter if you're Say or Kal. See you do something wrong with the Brewhehe.

Get a clue from A1 hand men Seth and Kyle - They’re always attentive. They got chillin’ STYLE.
