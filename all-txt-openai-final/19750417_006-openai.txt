**Norwegian label covers unsung talent**

**Albums Reviewed:**
- Conference of the Birds - David Holland Quartet
- Illusion Suite - Stanley Cowell Trio
- Witchi-Tai-To - Jan Garbarek-Bobo Stenson Quartet

The three records reviewed here are excellent examples of the unsung greatness of many jazz musicians. None of these are big names, and the record label is no American monolith of power, but the Norwegian label ECM, which is a pioneer in progressive jazz recording. The names on these records may become more famous if their talents are the determinants rather than hard sell promotion.

David Holland is probably the best known of the musicians here. Now playing bass for his own quartet, their “Conference of the Birds” album offers the widest variety of jazz in one record seen in a long time.

**Chick Corea**

Holland and the other members of his quartet have played with numerous big names, including Chick Corea on the “Circle” album reviewed a few weeks ago. Their polish and technical abilities shine through the whole album. The best cuts on the record feature Anthony Braxton with Sam Rivers on flute duets. Both the title song and “Now Here/Nowhere” feature these two musicians in soft lyrical numbers. Holland’s bass sets up a unique progression of tones while also providing the major rhythmic lines of the pieces.

**Bopping sax numbers**

The other songs on the record run the gamut from bopping sax numbers in the style of Ornette Coleman or late Coltrane, like “See Saw” to pure cacophony in “Q&A,” though their chaos is more pleasant than some. All songs on the album are Holland’s compositions. He beautifully blends the individual sounds of each instrument, allowing for solos without getting boring. His bass never intrudes into the compositions but can always be felt.

The second album features primarily the solo talents of Stanley Cowell. The name of his trio’s record is “Illusion Suite.” Cowell is a fine pianist and displays immaculate ability on numerous keyboard instruments, acoustic and otherwise. Cowell effectively blends the sound of the piano into rhythms set up by bass and drums on numbers like “Maimoun” and “Ibn Mukhtarr Mustapha.” Each performer solos on several occasions as well. As my particular bias against electricity in certain types of jazz has been stated before, I must mention that Cowell’s electric numbers do not achieve the quality of those pieces played on the piano. At times the electricity becomes somewhat too funky and distorted in the context of the rest of the record.

**Amazing dark horses**

But Cowell’s album (perhaps his first?) still reveals excellence.

The last record in this list of amazing dark horses again startles the listener with the wealth of little-known talent circulating in jazz. "Witchi-Tai-To" is performed by the Scandinavian group known as the Jan Garbarek-Bobo Stenson Quartet. But Bobo must be a transplanted expatriate from Harlem, because the group possesses a thrilling blend of mainline Black American jazz with the polish and tightness of a European group. The sax of Garbarek can wail with the best in the coterie which is carrying on the prominence of this instrument in jazz. He ranges from long sustained series of notes that are surprisingly tense and lively to jerky solos jumping up and down the scales. This is one of those rare albums where every cut is worth listening to.
