### Election ’84: The Coattail Effect
**Dr. Thomas Kazee**

Though most of the attention of this election year has been directed to the contest between Ronald Reagan and Walter Mondale, voters across the country will also be filling all 435 seats in the U.S. Senate. The impact of a Reagan win on policy-making for the next four years will be determined largely by the results of those House and Senate races. Even if Reagan wins easily — and a victory of major proportions seems likely — his effectiveness as President will be linked to the success of Republican and conservative Democratic House and Senate candidates this November.

What will a Reagan victory mean for House and Senate races? Will 1984 be a repeat of 1964, in which the Democratic party rode the coattails of a popular incumbent President, gaining 38 House and two Senate seats? Or will it be a repeat of 1972, in which the Nixon landslide was nearly devoid of coattails (how about that for a mixed metaphor)? That year, Republicans gained only 12 seats in the House and actually lost two seats in the Senate.

Of the 33 seats being contested in the Senate in 1984, 19 are currently held by Republicans, fourteen by Democrats. Since more of the Republican seats are believed to be vulnerable, most observers some time ago concluded (and some still cling to this view) that a gain of two or three Democratic seats was in the offing. This would still leave the Democrats short of a Senate majority, though it would increase their contingent from 45 seats (of a total of 100) to 47 or 48 seats. A recent Congressional Quarterly study concluded, for example, that the Tennessee Senate seat currently held by Republican Howard Baker will be won by Democrat Albert Gore, and that three Senate races — including the North Carolina Helms-Hunt contest — have “no clear favorite.” One other seat, now held by New Hampshire’s Gordon Humphrey, is listed as “leaning Republican.” On the Democratic side, there are no seats which seem to be in clear jeopardy, and only three which are even listed as “leaning Democratic.”

Democratic Senate hopes, in sum, are dependent on the absence of a significant nationwide Republican trend. Such a trend might sweep vulnerable incumbents Helms, Charles Percy (in Illinois), and Roger Jepsen (in Iowa) back into office. Unfortunately for the Democrats, that very trend seems to be developing in the late stages of the campaign; Republican hopes for retaining their 10-seat Senate majority, and the resulting support President Reagan would receive from the Senate during his second term, may be fulfilled.

In the House, the prospect of a major Republican win has turned a rather uneventful election year into one with potential for very significant change. A close Reagan-Mondale race would probably have left the House pretty much in the same shape it is today — that is, with about a 100-seat majority for the Democrats. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee was suggesting this summer, in fact, that their party might even gain about 10 House seats. The poor performance of the Mondale-Ferraro ticket, however, has left a number of previously secure Democratic incumbents in a vulnerable position, and made more secure numerous Republican incumbents in closely-contested districts. The probable gain, therefore, for the Republican party this year may be 20 seats or so. A Republican landslide could increase the number to 25 or 30 though a gain of more than that seems very unlikely. This is simply because House seats are usually resistant to wide partisan swings. There may be only 20 or so House elections which currently look like real toss-ups, but in many House districts a shift of several percentage points may change the outcome.

The aforementioned Congressional Quarterly survey rated 25 districts as “leaning” to the Democrats. This brings the total number of potentially winnable districts for the Republicans to 48. A Republican “landslide” — which might result in the shift of only four or five percentage points nationally to the GOP in congressional elections — could cause most of the toss-up and leaning districts to fall in the same direction.

Looking ahead, the election of 1984 may set the stage for a very significant midterm election in 1986. Republican senators elected in the Reagan sweep of 1980, which resulted in the Republicans regaining control of the U.S. Senate for the first time since 1952, will stand for reelection in 1986. In fact, of the 34 seats to be contested in 1986, Republicans hold 22. If history holds two years from now, the Republicans will almost certainly lose a number of Senate seats in that election. Some observers call this the “six-year itch;” after a term and one-half in office the party in power has never lost fewer than four — and usually more — Senate seats. One can see how important the 1984 elections have become.

What will a Reagan victory mean for House and Senate races? Will 1984 be a repeat of 1964, in which the Democratic party rode the coattails of a popular incumbent President, or will it be a repeat of 1972, in which the Nixon landslide was nearly devoid of coattails? Analysts at the Congressional Quarterly conclude, for example, that only five percent of House races in 1984...can be accurately characterized as toss-ups (23 of 435 seats). In short, it would take a Republican sweep of truly unexpected proportions to produce a gain in excess of 30 seats. If it is true that relatively few seats held by one party are “winnable” by the other, then why is there so much discussion of coattail effects this year? Though most commentators tend to exaggerate the potential importance of a strong presidential candidate for the rest of the party ticket, under certain circumstances significant coattail effects may develop. For example, though there thus become. If the Republicans lose several seats this year, and several more in 1986, the Democrats could very well regain control of the Senate. This clearly does not bode well for the Reagan administration, which, given the Democratic control of the House, will need all the support it can get from the Senate. As a Cleveland Indians (Browns, Cavaliers, etc.) fan, I have become accustomed to voicing an old lament: “Wait ‘til next year . . .” As one who views a Reagan landslide with some chagrin, I may have to revise that somewhat to: “Wait ’til 1986.” Kazee is an Assistant Professor of political science.

World Hunger: Poverty Amid Plenty
Charles Summers

Occasionally the sad ironies of our day leap at us from the pages of a single daily paper. Last Wednesday, Oct. 24 there were two such stories in The Charlotte Observer. In Section A we read an account of the famine victims in Ethiopia; thousands of women and children being turned away from refugee camps because there was no food for them. One camp with 90,000 waiting outside, had supplies for only 3,000. Then in Section D one found a story about a new wonder cosmetic being promoted in South Africa. The prime ingredient for the cosmetic is made by letting milk sour with a little grated cheese on top. Thousands of gallons of milk a day are curdling in South Africa in order to make “Cleopatra’s Secret” (which is guaranteed to make those unsightly wrinkles disappear). The irony is obvious and terrible. White people (the only ones being allowed to raise the culture for the cosmetic industry) in one African country are using food to make a “fountain of youth” cosmetic, while Blacks in another part of Africa are dying because of the lack of food. One group has the “problem” of unwanted wrinkles while others suffer from bloated bellies and premature death. As one South African pastor commented on the cosmetic boom, “Becoming wealthy and staying young. Two things everyone wants. I am sure that God will forgive this little bit of worldliness.” I am not so sure. Of course, the same contradiction can be found in almost any of our popular magazines. On one page is an ad asking for help for starving children (usually with a picture of a hungry child and an empty bowl) and on the opposite page is a grand announcement for a new weight loss miracle plan (“Lose pounds and inches without going hungry!”). First World people are trying to lose weight while Third World people are starving. Whites have too much while blacks do without.

The present drought in Africa is the worst in this century. Lack of rain, the spreading of the desert, the death of the cattle have all contributed to a massive famine. From Mauritania on the west to Ethiopia on the east, starvation is rampant. People are desperate. (Why have we not seen more of it in our U.S. press? Probably because it is “old” news. Africa just had a drought a few years ago. We only cover “new” crises.) In general, Davidson students are sensitive to these serious world problems. I hope the irony can stir our consciences. Campus groups are always looking for worthy projects to support. Here is a situation crying for help. Emergency aid can be channeled through any number of agencies (Church World Service, Catholic Relief Services, CARE, World Vision). Our gifts do make a difference, and they are needed now. In addition to immediate gifts, more long-term help can be included in our U.S. foreign aid programs. This means contacting our representatives to let them know that we care about what happens to these people. It means telling them that we want help sent now to the northern parts of Africa. It is money well spent on helping these people build a future for themselves and their children. It is money well spent in making allies for the U.S.A. Bread for the World is an organization that can help with changing U.S. aid problems. BFW is a Christian, grassroots lobbying effort. Art Simon, the executive director, formed the group over a decade ago to help people know which bills to support in order to help hungry people. (Art Simon will be on the Davidson campus next Friday speaking about the work of BFW). Cosmetics make us look younger, there are children whose parents pray they will survive to grow older. The ironies of our day challenge us. Which coupon will we fill out? The one for the weight-loss program or the one to feed the children? Which letter will we write? One asking for new investment possibilities or one asking our congressional representatives to vote more aid to the hungry? God and the poor are waiting to see what we will do.
