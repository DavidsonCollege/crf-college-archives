THE DAVIDSONIAN, DECEMBER 1, 1927

DUKE TILT IS FINAL FOR FOURTEEN WILDCATS

HUGH ARROWOOD

JIM GREY ENGLISH McGEACHY

CHARLIE HARRISON MUTT NISBET

The men whose pictures are on this page, together with Pat Harnion, Camper O’Neal, Lewis McColgan, Paul Maulden, and Dick
Grey, whose picture appears on the sports page, all played their last game in a Wildcat uniform last Thursday against
Duke. As many of these were star players, they leave vacancies in the ranks that will present a real problem
to Coaches Younger and Tilson at the beginning of next season.

When Xerxes wept

THE great Persian ruler gazed from a hilltop upon his vast army of a million men. It was the largest
army that had ever existed. And he turned away with tears in his eyes because in a hundred years all
trace of it would be gone. That army was a symbol of power, destructive and transient.

Today in one machine, now being built in the General Electric shops, there is combined the muscular energy of two
million men. This great machine, a steam turbine, is also a symbol of power—a new power that is constructive and
permanent.

This mammoth steam turbine with a total capacity of 208,000 horsepower will be installed in the new station of the
State Line Generating Company. What a striking contrast between this huge generating unit and the group of toasters, lamps, fans,
vacuum cleaners, call bells, etc. Yet General Electric, ever on the alert to supply plenty of electricity at a low
cost to all.

A SPRINKLER HEAD will discharge over 1,000 gallons of water in 30 minutes, or about 35 gallons in 60 seconds.
No merchant or manufacturer can afford to be without our SPRINKLER LEAKAGE POLICY.

The cost is a trifle compared with the protection.
