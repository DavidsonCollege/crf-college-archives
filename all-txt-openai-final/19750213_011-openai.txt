. WHAT SORT OF MAN READS THE DAVIDSONIAN?

A man who realizes that good things come in threes—like number three pencils. He’s youthful, aware, half-educated with a future
that looks bright indeed compared to his life now. Whether reading his favorite newspaper or otherwise wasting his time, he
gets more out of the experience by putting more of himself into it. And he finds being fully involved pays
off. Fact: More men with grade point averages less than 2.0 read The Davidsonian more carefully than they read any
other publication. Want to reach men who have better things to do with their time than study? Spend more time
in The Davidsonian. (Source: Registrar’s Office.)
