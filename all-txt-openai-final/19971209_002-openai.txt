Vagt’s decision on sororities pending
Faculty, students apprehensive

President Bobby Vagt has yet to announce whether or not sororities will be invited to Davidson College. He is projected,
at the earliest, to make his decision public Dec. 15 at this semester’s final faculty meeting. Prior to that meeting,
staff will hold two faculty forums to debate the issue. Students have noticed sorority advertisements on their halls recently, however.
A leaflet with “Check out these sorority programs!” handwritten across the top has shown up in several dormitories over the
past few weeks. The programs, specifically, are substance awareness and education, eating disorder, and rape prevention programs from Chi Omega
and Kappa Kappa Gamma sororities. The focus on these organizations indicates that Chi Omega and Kappa Kappa will be the
actual sororities invited should President Vagt allow them. Vagt, busy on trips to Russia, Atlanta, and New York City this
past week, could not be reached for specific comment on the issue.

History professor Jonathan Berkey expects the faculty to be able to voice its opinion to Vagt at that meeting. Berkey,
a Campus Committee for Religious Life member, who voted against sororities, expects a sincere and thorough debate. “There should be
a lot of opposition and certainly that opposition should be expressed quite vocally,” he said. The faculty can pass motions
or resolutions about the issue, but Vagt’s decision will ultimately be the only one that will allow sororities on campus
or keep them off.

Pipe problem causes late-night excitement

On Nov. 22, at 1:00 a.m., Duke residents woke abruptly to the incessant pound of a manhole cover, buffeted by
a geyser of steam. Students poured onto the lawn behind Duke to behold the gusher. “The toilets wouldn’t flush and
the sinks ran dry,” senior Tim Saintsing said. “I thought Duke was going to blow.”

According to Mechanical Shop supervisor Jerry Archer, water had leaked from a valve nipple into the tunnel that carries steam
into Duke, flashing to steam itself as it hit the scalding pipes. The force of the steam escaping repeatedly blew
the manhole cover off its shaft. Maintenance mechanic Joe Crisp responded to the call, cutting off the steam and patching
leaks promptly, as a throng of curious students looked on. The water pipe is equipped with a strainer on entrance
to the building, and the valve nipple which periodically cleans the strainer rusted through, causing the leak. The nipple was
replaced, and Archer said—not to worry—most of Davidson’s water pipes are copper, which do not rust so easily.

Some students—although initially captivated by the confusion—tired and left the scene. “I was amazed that people were standing with their
mouths open watching a manhole cover thump and hot water vapor rise,” junior Kurt Fesenmyer said. “It was an entertaining
evening,” said Saintsing.

Patterson endowment established for Econ
College Relations

Friends, colleagues, and former students have established the Patterson Endowment in Economics in memory of Professor Ernest Finney Patterson, professor
of economics at Davidson for more than two decades and an active fighter for the welfare of those less economically
fortunate. Timed for the 40th Anniversary of “Pat” Patterson’s arrival at Davidson in 1957, the Endowment will commemorate his career
as a teacher and social activist by providing funds for projects consistent with his personal ideals. The endowment will subsidize
students engaged in research projects in economics and support an annual departmental award to a junior or senior student who
has demonstrated accomplishment in economics.

In honor of the establishment of this endowment, Professor of English Tony Abbott has edited a collection of Professor Patterson’s
poems. Called Poems for the People because of their subject matter and their direct and immediate emotional appeal to the
reader, this collection of 30 poems includes a Foreword by Professor Charles Ratliff ‘47, longtime professor of economics and close
friend of Dr. Patterson, and a handsome cover drawing of Ernie Patterson by Tom Clark ‘49. “These poems crafted for
the people,” Ratliff said, “are by one who crafted his life for the people.” Many of them are set on
the farm in Rising Star, Texas, where Patterson grew up.During the 1920s and the early years of the Great Depression,
a copy of "Poems for the People" will be given to donors who contribute at least $100 to the Endowment.
Contributions earmarked for the Patterson Endowment should be mailed to Professor Clark Ross, Chair, Department of Economics, P.O. Box 1719,
Davidson, N.C., 28036. Checks should be made payable to Davidson College.

**9th Annual Christmas in Davidson brings Village charm — and Santa**

By Mary Lee, Staff Writer

“Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer, had a very shiny nose...” Village charm could be felt late last week during Davidson’s 9th
Annual Christmas in Davidson celebration. Three evenings of festivities, music, storytelling, caroling, entertaining, and Christmas spirit began Wednesday at an
Opening Ceremony on the Village Green. A special guest — Santa Claus — arrived by fire truck.

Every year since 1989, the town of Davidson celebrates three nights of merrymaking during the week after Thanksgiving. The event
has grown so much since its beginning that the number of carriage and hay rides has been increased to accommodate
the larger crowds.

“The event promotes a feeling of community and Christmas spirit,” said Irene Blackwell, who is a member of the Downtown
Davidson Organization (DDO), which is presenting the event along with the Davidson Parks and Recreation Department. “It has evoked enthusiasm
from the very beginning and is community-wide. The College, industries, churches, and merchants all participate.”

More than 35 merchants and non-profit groups participated at Christmas in Davidson 1997. Shop owners opened their doors every evening
from 6:30 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. to provide free refreshments, planned entertainment, and night shopping. Along with Santa’s appearance on
the fire truck, the Doggie Holiday Fashion Show on the Village Green Thursday was also a favorite. Town and area
residents entered their pooches in a dog show, only with a twist — the pets were decked out and judged
in holiday costumes.

“One dog was dressed in a butterfly costume,” Rebecca Clark of DDO said. “He jumped up and down and looked
just like a butterfly.”

Many corporations contributed to the event’s success, including BB&T, Davidson College, Duke Power, First Union National Bank, Ingersoll-Rand, Jaspers Restaurant,
Kennerly Development, Metrolina Warehouse, Revell Manufacturing, and The Village Store.

“We are also especially appreciative of town employees,” Clark added, “for stringing up the lights and banners throughout town.”

If students would like to participate next year as entertainers or performers, they should contact the Davidson Parks and Recreation
Department. “Most of the entertainers get paid,” Clark said, “so if you have juggling or musical talents, you could make
some money for the holidays and experience some of Davidson’s Christmas spirit.”

**Davidson merchants get in giving spirit**

From staff reports

The merchants of Davidson would like to announce that they will be accepting non-perishable and canned food donations until the
end of December, a Ben and Jerry’s press release announced. These food items will be donated to the Loaves and
Fishes food pantry at the Ada Jenkins Center. The Loaves and Fishes food pantry works under the umbrella of the
Loaves and Fishes of Charlotte. It fills a large need for emergency food in this area for people in crisis.

The food pantry will be unable to distribute food until the middle of December. Ben and Jerry’s is giving free
sprinkles with any food donation. The Village Store on Main Street in Davidson is offering a greeting card with any
donation. And at the south end of Davidson on Main Street, Grandma Linda’s Homestyle Bakery is giving free cookies to
anyone who donates.

The Davidson Ice House, the Wheel, and the Merrill-Jennings Galleries are also accepting donations at this time. In Davidson, one
can drop off donations at the following places: Main Street Books, the Get Smarts Shoppe, Frankly My Dear, Dream Weaver,
the Needlecraft Center, the Soda Shop, the Village Cupboard, Raeford’s Barber Shop, the accounting firm of Helen G. Coley, C.P.A.,
P.A., and the new Village Tack Shop that hopes to open by mid-December.
