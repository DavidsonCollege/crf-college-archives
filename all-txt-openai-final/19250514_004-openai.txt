### EDITORIAL

Sixteen more days—then home!

Baseball and track are things of the past. Examinations, what ho! Now is the time for that last dig at
your studies. It will save many a head-scratch during examinations.

We've all heard about those grapefruit girls—you squeeze them and they hit you in the eye.

All undergraduates are looking forward to next fall when they can park their John Wards beneath the handsome seats in
the new Chambers. Things won’t be the same, brother. Mark them words.

This issue of The Davidsonian marks the last of this year’s effort at putting out the best college paper in
the South. With the coming of a new college year, the financial affairs will have all been straightened out and
a long road filled with success will be opened. The present staff intends to do their level best to make
this publication better than ever.

Long-legged John Currie’s performance in the Greensboro track meet has caused a glow of honest pride in every Davidsonian. Anyone
who can run a hundred yards in less than ten seconds has our support every time. John not only did
that but he equaled the world’s record by making a time of 9 3-5 seconds. He pushed Scholz, an Olympic
man, so hard that the latter ran the century in 9 5-10 seconds, which is a world’s record. Only four
men have equaled Currie’s record.

Vacation is only around the corner now. Those long three months are ours to use, and we can use that
time to a good advantage, or we can waste it. A little systematic study during the whole of that vacation
would work wonders in helping us get started back into school work next fall. Then is the chance to read
those books, to write that play or poem, or to do anything for which you didn’t have time this year.

Sunday was appropriately observed as Mother’s Day. We should endeavor to make every day a Mother’s Day. We can write
her, or let her know that she is uppermost in our minds and hearts. During these vacation months when we
are at home, we can strive to show by acts of kindness and love, the great appreciation that we have
for her.

### THE STUDENT STORE

The store that was fostered by student initiative and that has been kept up by the generous patronage of every
member of the Davidson student body, has done well indeed. It has run only a little over a year, and
during that time, has delivered a nice profit. It has served the students well, and they in turn have accorded
it their whole-hearted support.

The editor of The Davidsonian published, last year, a strong plea for the use of the profits that are derived
from the management of this store, towards the building up of the various publications that are an integral part of
the student body. The Davidsonian was one of the prime factors in the securing of this store, and it has
taken a lively interest in its welfare. What it does desire to see now, is the wise use of the
profits in the fostering of The Davidsonian, the Davidson College Magazine, and the Quips and Cranks.

It is hard for the average student to realize what a hard time the college paper has, especially in a
town the size of Davidson. The merchants of the town are willing to back the publications but they cannot be
expected to do more than a fair share. Charlotte keeps up two large daily papers, several religious papers, college publications,
and in addition, is called upon by the students of Davidson to advertise in three or four different publications. Ads
are hard to get at times, and to some merchants, it seems more a matter of philanthropy than business.

The student body contributes about a third or a half of the total amount necessary to put out a creditable
publication. The other part is expected to be secured by the efforts of those who have the interest of the
think at heart. The Davidsonian has had hard sledding indeed, but it has emerged triumphant, and is recognized as the
best college newspaper in the state, and by many as the best in the South. It has done this in
spite of the fact a large debt has stood in front of it most of the time, and in spite
of the fact that there has never been an adequate office given over to the work; no typewriters, office equipment,
or anything else. It has certainly led a hand-to-mouth existence during the large part of its existence.

The Magazine, for instance, imagine a literary college such as Davidson publishing only one literary magazine during the entire college
year. Even a second-rate high school can do better than that. How can any college hope to foster the very
best of literary ideals when its students have no organ for the expression of their literary emotions other than a
magazine that comes out once per annum.

We recognize that a liberal sum has been given out of the proceeds of this store, to the Athletic Association.
That is just. Athletics are important, but so is literary work. What The Davidsonian would like to see would be
a proportionate division of the profits of the Student Store; a certain per capita going to this paper, the same
to Quips and Cranks, and perhaps a smaller percentage to the Magazine. We know that this would ensure a better
publication, and this in turn would help the student body towards that sphere of usefulness to which they aspire.

### RETRIBUTION?

Again the high and mighty majesty of the law has found its victims. The grasping tentacles of justice reached out
and entangled themselves around the bodies of Cal Stewart, the older, and Elmer Stewart, the younger. Last Friday the lives
of these two men who were convicted of the murder of two other men, were snuffed out by the relentless
power of electricity. They paid the penalty that has been imposed upon those who would kill.

Father and son they were, both fine-looking specimens of vigorous physical manhood. In anticipation of the dual execution, the trappings
and paraphernalia of the death-room had been made new. The straps had been replaced by new leather ones, the metal
helmet was shiny, and even the Bible used in the last simple religious rites was a new one. The old
man entered the death chamber with a firm step. He had made peace with his God.and was ready. His last
words were words of exhortation to those that heard him, in which he urged them to live like Christians. When
the sinister power of the unseen force hit the body of the man, he crumpled in the death chair. A
horrible moment of sputtering sparks and broiling human flesh, the smell of charred skin,—and then, death came. The young Stewart
was a fine-looking chap. One would have taken him for a football player of some college, or a catcher behind
the bat on a league team. He had poise, and his features were clean-cut. He was not cock-sure as he
was led to the chair. His was none of the sullen courage of his father’s. He loved life—and youth. But
the hovering form of death bore him away, even as his father had been taken away from this earth a
few minutes before. It is not up to us to say whether capital punishment is right or wrong. Some say
that murder is murder, whether it is legalized or not. Others say that the solemn majesty of the law must
be upheld at any cost. Be it as it may, the taking of human life is a serious thing. Maybe
there is an excuse for it. We just wonder whether this young man, in the full spring of youth, was
given a fair chance. We wonder whether he would not have turned out more than a murderer if his father
had been a pal to him. A pal in fun and in the finer things of life, rather than in
a life of crime and shame. Did the pleadings and tears of a little mother back in the hills have
an effect upon her boy, or did the father crush out any feelings of home and love? Did this boy
ever realize that he was headed toward destruction, and that his life was to pay for the wrongs that he
had committed? No one can say now. Certain it is that there are those who mourn now for the passing
of a fine-looking youth in the glorious stage of early manhood; one who might have felt the fires of higher
ambition and might have caught the challenge to a higher service. If his father had only been a pal, and
could have directed his steps aright.

“OUR WILD YOUNG PEOPLE”

Slowly and surely as the charges of worldliness, materialism, and immorality are being piled up against the college boys of
the present generation, facts based upon statistics are being balanced on the other side that in the end will show
that the average American student of today is turning to better things than his fathers. Novel after novel has appeared
in the last few years with the theme of the wildness of the younger generation underlying the plot; magazines splurge
whole sections to show the exploits of the “rah, rah boys”; and newspapers clamor for sensational stories of crime and
immorality from the same sources. But wild as the boys and girls may be from the outward appearances, their outlook
upon life seems to be a bit higher, a good bit more of the idealistic viewpoint prevails. Statistics from Harvard,
taken from the members of the senior class, are what the above statements are based upon. Although forty-five percent of
the fathers of the Harvard men are engaged in business, only 21 percent of their sons will enter that work;
although only 5 percent of the fathers are in the profession of medicine, 15 percent of their sons will become
doctors; although only 3 percent of the fathers are engaged in teaching, 10 percent of the graduating class will enter
the fields of education. The list of the occupations in order of diminishing money returns is: “Business, law, medicine, education,
the church.” So it seems that there is some great change in the youth of Harvard, and certainly Harvard is
a typical college of typical American students, when 53 percent of the sons of businessmen (probably successful businessmen at that)
have decided not to enter that field; certainly there is a great change in the youth when the trend toward
the less remunerative occupations is 100 percent stronger than that of the past generation. In the words of the Times:
“Apparently the appetite for money-making in the United States is on the decline and the instinct for service is thriving
among our supposedly wild young people.”

SACRIFICE
By Joe Earnest

Deep in a cove of the mountains,
By a narrow grave,
Where no light or sunshine
To warm the little mound
Ever penetrates,
No pathway winds along the brook
That trickles near the tomb.
A spot, forgotten by man;
In the eyes of God, mere clay.
Tiny fingers, dried with age,
Two eyelids, closed ere scarce they opened
A voice that was, but is no more,
Repose beneath the gloom.
A single cry there was,
A muffled wail,
'Till murderous claws in shame
Clutched the tender throat
And sacrificed a human life
To cheat society.

A SONG AT NIGHT

I think the moon should always shine
In silver fragments thru a pine.
The moon behind a maple tree
Is gay, like woman’s love to me.
The leaves of poplars seem to make
The moon an icy mountain lake.
And oaks are like cold mists that rise
And blot the stars from out the skies.
While willows are like arms that place
A veil of darkness o’er his face.
But pine leaves are like hidden darts
That pierce the moon’s sad silver heart.
I think the moon should always shine
In silver fragments thru a pine.

—E. P. O’Connor.

Speaking of fashions, the first woman to get her clothes from Paris was Helen of Troy.

The old mountaineer was dying. He lay on his deathbed, and even as he started to speak, his nostrils quivered
almost imperceptibly as he smelled something. He addressed his words to his daughter who stood near him, brushing her teeth
with a sprig of slippery-elm. “Sis, can’t I have a bite of that ham I smell cooking?” His daughter looked
at him with impatience. “Pa, ain't I done told you that ham is for the funeral tomorrow?”

Let the entire congregation rise and join in that old-fashioned duck song, “Waddle I do.”

The only difference between the old-fashioned kiss and the kiss of the present age is about five minutes.

LITTLE BOYS’ BLUES

The old school books are covered with dust,
But mournfully, silent they stand.
And the old fountain pen is red with rust,
The ball field is covered with sand.
Time was when the midnight oil burned low,
And the students were passing fair,
But that was the time when summer was not
And vacation was not in the air.

Bob Mitchell never has found out who that guy, Oii Tempered is, whose name he saw on a baseball bat
a few days ago. He might possibly be singing first bass in the Epworth League.

She was only a taxidermist’s daughter, but she knew her stuff.

THINGS TO WORRY ABOUT

Champagne costs a hundred francs a quart in Paris.
Tasmania is having an unprecedented number of cockroach collectors to contend with this season.
Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey’s Circus have some attractive jobs open as lion tamers. Board free (we don’t know
whether that means for the tamer or the lion.)
Scientists tell us that in the next billion years that women will go back to fig leaves for clothes.

Lux—Didja hear about Summers? He was engaged to marry a chorus girl.
Bon Ami—What folly!
Lux—Ziegfeld’s.

Speaking of follies, a chorus girl simply has to have three important qualifications. A good voice is one of them.

FOILED! BY GUM

A tall and comely Plymouth Rock
Had found herself a nest.
And the farmer's wife placed fifteen eggs
In there at her request.
She sat upon those eggs a week,
Two weeks—and then ’twas three.
The old hen worried night and day—
Where could her children be?
Four weeks she sat and then there hatched
Young ducks with waddling legs.
And all of which will go to prove,
She didn’t know her eggs.

Above is the picture of the average student's mind about examination time.
