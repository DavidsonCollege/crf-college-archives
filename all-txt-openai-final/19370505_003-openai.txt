Science Fraternities Give Vivid Demonstrations of Natural Phenomena

Feature of Meeting Was Demonstration of Polarized Light

SEEN BY LARGE CROWD

Proves to Be One of Outstanding Meetings of Year

Chemical and physical phenomena featured the joint meeting of Sigma Pi Sigma and Gamma Sigma Epsilon Monday night. Bubbles that
floated and exploded, copper balls that spinned and turned in water, brilliant lights that one could look at, and the
growth of crystals on the screen were the order of the evening.

Featured at the meeting was a demonstration of polarized light by Walker Harper. With polarizing lenses, he showed how polarized
light made stress and strain in a piece of glass visible. The actual growth of a crystal, one of the
most spectacular examples of the effect of polarized light, was shown on the screen.

Marion Bryant gave a demonstration of filling soap bubbles with hydrogen and then setting them on fire. He also made
a balloon from collodion and nitro-cotton, filled it with hydrogen, and set it on fire. Next, he combined sodium and
chlorine light. This produced a brilliant light, brighter than ordinary lights. The heat generated from the mixture of these two
melted the test tube in which they were mixed.

Milton Crisp gave a demonstration of electromagnetic force. The strength of the magnetic field was shown by the force in
which a metal ring was thrown into the air. He also showed the principle of a motor when he made,
by the same principle, a copper ball spin in a jar of water.

J. Y. Templeton demonstrated the properties of carbon dioxide by filling a jar with the dioxide (Continued on Page 6).

PARADE TO BE GIVEN FOR MISS DOROTHY BAGWELL

Will Reward Winners of Competitive Drill

BATTALION TO PARADE

Ceremony Is Prelude to Military Ball That Night

On Friday afternoon the R.O.T.C. department is sponsoring a parade and battalion ceremony in honor of Miss Dorothy Bagwell of
Atlanta, Ga. The parade will begin in the usual manner and will be closely observed by Miss Bagwell. After the
usual routine is finished, the guest will present the trophies to the winners of the competitive drill of last week.
These trophies will go to the following: To Commander Ralph McClellan of Company ‘A’ for the best-drilled company in the
battalion; to Lieutenant Jim Johnston of Company ‘D’ for the best-drilled platoon. Also, an award will be made by Scabbard
and Blade to the best-drilled freshman.

After the presentations, the battalion will pass in review before the visitor and then be dismissed. This ceremony is a
prelude to the Military Ball, which will be held Friday night, at which time the Scabbard and Blade members are
to give the figure. This figure will be led by Mr. Jack Branch, Battalion Commander, and his date, Miss Bagwell.
