**Beenie 21, 1979—The Da Definitions**

**Bill Peeples**

There are times when the O.E.D. does not provide the definitions for words and phrases most frequently used by Davidson students, and perhaps unfamiliar to the incoming freshman. On the assumption that orientation did not tell you all you need to know, then the brief dictionary which follows will let you, the freshman, in on a few secrets.

**The Davidson A:** A pigment of your infatuation, sort of like climbing Everest clad in a swimsuit using only one hand.

**The Plaza:** The eighteenth green of academia, The Plaza is the expanse of brick paving that extends from the E.H. Little Library to Chambers.

**Old Davidson:** This refers to a bygone era at DC when men were men and women were down the road.

**The Special:** A sandwich, what Mary and Murray serve is indeed special after weeks and weeks of ARA, that has a growing cult following.

**The Road:** In the near future, this includes Salem, Converse, Hollins, Mary Baldwin, Queens, etc. Better than a B.C. Powder—no sex at Davidson.

**The Road (female version):** Appy, W&L, VMI, Chapel Hill, J.C. Smith, etc.—the remedies for periodic frustration.

**The Road Trip:** Coming sooner than you think, you could win a free vacation to Anchorage, Alaska, via UPS.

**Gator:** Fraternity pastime in which revelers work variations on the flesh pile theme.

**Preppy:** Anyone, male or female, who has a marginal and elastic demand to gator.

**Punt:** You should not have waited till the last minute. It’s fourth and 2,000 pages to go. You could “suck wind” and face “life in the big city” and book all night. But then again, you could hijack a Saturn V and fly to Mars. So Punt.

**Geek:** Not to be confused with Greek, save a few, he has the innate, enduring suaveness of Don Rickles, the charm of Mean Joe Green, and the self-confident resourcefulness of Charlie Brown.

**Davidson’s Barber Shop:** On Main Street, where you go if you are in ROTC and leaving Davidson for a leisurely summer at Ranger School.

**The 900 Room:** A place you frequent frequently only if you do not plan to graduate on time.

**The P.O.:** Davidson’s daily Mecca at 10:00 A.M., second only to the 900 Room at 10:00 P.M.

**Space Cadet:** Akin to Drop-Add and the Geek. Those who did not take advantage of JYA and resemble Battlestar Galactica by going “Beep, beep, beep. Who am I, where am I, what am I?” Is it soup, yet?

**Bonehead and the Brick Brothers:** BB & B, a weekly Davidsonian farce that is a bizarre masterpiece of chauvinism, subjectivity, absurdity, Morkism, McCarthyism, absolutism, fascism, and alchemy. It has nothing to do with IMAC sports, except women’s intramurals.

**Freshmints:** BB & B’s favorite, ultimate put-down. Also a reference to freshmen.

**Davidson Update:** Illegitimate first cousin of the Davidsonian.

**Butch:** Davidson’s token campus canine, a product of indeterminate origin.

**Cashion’s National Bank:** Within the facade of grocery store and restaurant, this financial institution in Cornelius will handle more of your money than the Piedmont Bank.

**The Big Eight:** A nightmare that occurs at 8:00 A.M. Monday through Friday if you were lucky and signed up for it. The Big Eight should be illegal.

**NC vs HEW**

**Frank Santore**

The state of North Carolina has been hitched to the whipping post recently by altruistic architects who have a rather distorted view of society. Two examples stand out in this regard. First, the five-figure bureaucrats who run the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare have stated that North Carolina’s University system does not provide equal opportunities for all people simply because five of the state’s institutions of higher learning have black populations in excess of eighty-eight percent, while the rest have black populations under twelve percent, according to the September 9th Charlotte Observer.

While there are some discrepancies—in percentage of faculty members with advanced degrees, for example—between so-called “black” and “white” institutions, these can be corrected by such things as salary incentives to lure more experienced academicians to the institutions in question.

But, no: this is too simple for your “friends” at the federal government. Instead, for want of something to do (other than make paper airplanes, perhaps) HEW has attempted to phase out “black” institutions by dismissing them as ugly reminders of segregation. This is illogical for two reasons. First, no student, regardless of race, creed, color, sex, or national origin, is denied access to any institution of higher learning in this state under the auspices of various pieces of civil rights legislation presently on the books. Thus, North Carolina’s institutions of higher learning are required by law to be fully integrated.

Secondly, black colleges play an important role within the black community. In the sordid age of apartheid, black colleges stood as a lighthouse in the midst of a hurricane. From black colleges came the women and men who were to shape the integration movement in our country. Today, black colleges stand as a symbol of black pride, a reminder of the difficult times of the past, and as instruments to challenge ALL people to the tremendous tasks which lie ahead. The latter is most important, for the “slow fade to white” of many black institutions (under guidelines established under HEW) would mean that thousands of students who could not otherwise go to college would be deprived of that chance, along with special attention in the classroom and a chance to develop a sense of ethnic pride not easily cultivated in other institutions. This is something that the “eight hour liberal,” that particular animal who commutes back-and-forth to...his bureaucracy from the suburbs of D.C., who spends “eight hours a day issuing self-righteous dictums only to return home on the 5:15 for dinner, drinks, and dancing at his all-white country club in his lily-white neighborhood, cannot understand. The second example of the federal government as North Carolina's Simon Legree, HEW's anti-smoking campaign, is such a prototype. The federal government wants to bring a social habit which has been a part of American culture since Raleigh first landed on the shores of Carolina (smoking) into the political realm by launching a massive anti-smoking campaign, by spending more millions of dollars to perform a function which those in our medical profession could accomplish on an individual basis. It has been the contention of the government that the “tobacco lobby” promulgates a dangerous habit in order to reap economic gains from supposedly helpless Americans. Gee, I wonder how the “tobacco lobby,” the poor dirt farmers who eke out a living by putting out tobacco, the many thousands of workers in the Carolinas who cut, ship, and package tobacco products, would feel if the government decided to tighten its grip on the tobacco industry by prohibiting smoking? It would probably mean economic collapse, not for big industrialists, but for the little people whose very subsistence depends on “Walter Raleigh’s weed.” As I hope you can see, the political realm in this country is slowly eating more and more out of the social pie; government robs Peter to pay Paul in order to promulgate a vision of a land of milk and honey. Sadly, liberalism seems to be the only ideology propounded at Davidson. It is implied, for example, in a Humanities course that the United States is shirking its duty to the world, a world which it has fed, clothed, and sheltered from tyrants, by not supplying one-tenth of one percent of its Gross National Product to the United Nations. It is also implied that certain values once held dear in this country (such as respect for the Flag and hard work) are akin to certain elements of Fascism; that to defend one’s homeland is a cardinal sin, that free-enterprise and individual initiative are exploitative as compared to a utopian society first expounded by More and later revised for Marxian interpretation. A new conservative viewpoint needs to be expressed in conjunction with liberalism, not only at Davidson, but also on many other campuses; I fear that if it is not, we will all become whipping boys. It is my hope that this monthly column will present this viewpoint.

‘Maximum Sex’ in Love
Mike Mason

After two intensive weeks of calculus and limits, to say that I found the idea of “maximum” sex intriguing is an understatement of wondrous proportions. If there's a limit, then I certainly want to know about it. After all, if there exists an equation which reads “the limit, as female availability approaches zero, of sexual activity,” then the ideal environment in which to discuss it is definitely Davidson. Besides, the posters reading “Maximum: Sex in Love Auditorium” made the event too good to pass up. So several others and I, the body serums of our ancestral fathers pounding in our ears, tripped blithely off to the auditorium at the appointed hour. Ahh, the wonders we were about to behold; if we were lucky, this might turn out to be one of those audience participation seminars. The atmosphere had all the exuberance of a double feature of “Rona Bares It” and “Wet Midgets go Wild,” (not that I'd know.) Finally, the speaker, the focus of all this hormone secretion, ascended the stage, and began to speak. He immediately promised to make us mad, to fill us with divine indignation. Oh goody. He then proceeded to drop the microphone on the floor a few times and reel it back up from his waist. Good, this is getting blatantly Freudian. But from here on, things deteriorated rapidly. He lectured in an evangelistic manner, except for those rare moments when his voice broke accepted sound barriers, and that garbled soprano screeched to all corners of the room such linguistic gems as “I'm disgusted!!!” But we waited with bated breath, anticipating the moment he would shear away our innocent naivete with scissors of sexual perception. Suddenly, there was a glimmer of hope. He remarked that he would like to “touch on another area”— but wait, we missed it the first time. And, strangely enough, we continued to miss it. If there was any instructional information in that dissertation, it was lost in a maze of theology and verbal condescension. So where was the decadent symbolism, the unlimited debauchery the DCF posters led us to expect? Certainly not in the lecture, which, for the most part, was standard, religiously based love/sex material— no whips, no chains, nothing. Even worse, the point of view presented from the podium was conspicuously chauvinistic. Apparently, whenever there occurs sexual activity without an accompanying good relationship (or a permission slip signed by one’s parents), the girl is bound to end up pregnant, insane, cross-eyed, or dead, while the guy, after the same event, walks, albeit uncomfortably, into the sunset. Throughout the lecture, women were portrayed as being mangled, martyred, and molested by unscrupulous men, who cannot come up (so to speak) with any piece of decency. Naughty, naughty men, geez, can’t help it. At least the posters for the lecture remain—fond memories of relevance that might have been. Next time, take a hint, folks— if you want decadence, stick to Basement Belk.
