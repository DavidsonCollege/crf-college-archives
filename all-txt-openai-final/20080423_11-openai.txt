By ANNA STRINGFIELD

The women’s lacrosse team lost a close match on Sunday against the University of Louisville Cardinals. The 13-12 score brought
the ’Cats record to 10-5 and brought the Cardinals to 10-4 on the season.

On the offensive front, Emily Diefendorf '08 scored three goals for the Wildcats, bringing her season total to 32. Jen
Crawford '10 brought home two goals for the team, making 33 goals for the season, a team high. Sarah Walker
'08 added one goal and a team high of 10 assists. Becky Horton '09, Emily Palmer '08, and Haley Cook
'10 all joined in the offensive effort.

On the defensive side of the field, goalie Laura Johnson '08 battled the Louisville offense for the entire 60 minutes
but could not hold the Cardinals offense to single-digit scoring. Both Davidson and Louisville had 32 shots on goal and
12 ground balls, but Louisville’s superior execution carried the day.

The team will wrap up their season on Saturday, April 26 at 1 pm as they take on Howard University.
Come out and support the 'Cats on Senior Day as they take on the Bison.

Laura Johnson '08 played all 60 minutes in goal against Louisville.

Tennis heartbreak with 4-3 defeat
By ZACH ZIMMERMAN
Staff Writer

On Friday, the Davidson men’s tennis team concluded its season with a heartbreaking loss in the quarterfinals of the SoCon
tournament against Appalachian State. With the loss, the team’s final record stands at 14-8. Flaviu Simihaian '08 closed out his
career at Davidson with 43 wins in his four years. Along with Ethan Jaffee '09, Simihaian was selected for the
All-SoCon first team.

Davidson started off the day by dropping all three doubles matches to Appalachian State, bringing the overall score to 1-0.
Despite the setback, Davidson came back strong with two wins at No. 1 and No. 3 singles by Flaviu Simihaian
'08 and Ethan Jaffee '09, respectively. With Davidson up by a score of 2-1, ASU secured the third match of
the day to tie the score 2-2. Scott Myers '09 put Davidson back on top with a win at No.
6 by a score of 7-5 and 6-3. Myers finished the season as an All-SoCon second team member and finished
the season at 18-4. Eric Noble '10 and Sam Burns '10 found themselves with early leads in both their matches
but could not close either of them out in the third set. These defeats secured the ASU victory by an
overall score of 4-3.

Although the team will lose Simihaian and Compeau next year, Davidson will return a vast majority of its roster next
season hungry to win the SoCon Championship.

Golf finishes ninth at SoCon tournament
By PatrickMCARDLE Sports Editor

The Davidson golf team’s season came to a close with a ninth-place finish following a 54-hole total of 929 (309-308-312)
at the 2008 SoCon Men’s Golf Tournament Tuesday at the Country Club of South Carolina this last weekend. Michael Saari
’09 started the tournament off strong, scoring an opening day one-over 73 to tie for eighth place. Unfortunately, Saari shot
a disappointing eight-over 80 on the second day of the tournament, and he ended the tournament tied for 37th with
a +17. David Fowler ’09 led the Wildcats on the final two days of the tournament, posting a final round
76 to place tied for 32nd. Other Davidson competitors included Adam Lewicki ’11 (T-37th / +17), Ryan Crum ’11 (43rd
/ +22), and Christopher Rollins ’11 (44th / +23).

Chattanooga, who entered the event ranked 17th nationally, claimed its second straight team title with a three-day total of 865
(290-281-294). The Mocs finished eight strokes ahead of College of Charleston and nine swings clear of Western Carolina. The Catamounts’
Matt Cook finished atop the individual leaderboard at five-under 211 (75-67-69). Cook rallied from one stroke back to better Ben
Rickett (Chattanooga), the overnight leader, and Nathan Stamey (UNC Greensboro) by four shots.

Secondly, these players put in 100 percent effort for the entire 60 minutes or more in each playoff game, as
evidenced by their toothless grins. I will not argue with anyone about the regular season; as with the NBA, nobody
wants to watch millionaires put in little to no effort. The NHL playoffs, though, are different. Playoffs are the young,
superstar talents that are lacing them up for exciting teams. Lord Stanley's Cup is the perfect coach. And of course,
the fights are still there, stemming from violent body checks as a scorer ventures into the middle of the ice.

My third reason contradicts my statement at the beginning of the article that I don’t expect you to know or
care about the players involved. Get to know them because the best reason to watch these players—like Pittsburgh’s phenoms Sidney
Crosby and Evgeni Malkin, as well as Washington's over 100-point scoring Ovechkin—are household names for people that do not know
the sport. That does not change the fact that...
