Kuykendall presides over final Davidson commencement

John Kuykendall, who officially stepped down from his presidential post June 30, presided over his 13th and final commencement May
18. “We aren’t through with you,” he told the graduates. “The lessons and values you’ve learned, the friendships you’ve made,
will continue to be active in your life. You will continue your Davidson education for the rest of your life.”

Elena Simon Franklin, a chemistry major from Memphis, Tenn., and Old Bridge, N.J., was the top graduate, earning magna cum
laude honors. Franklin will travel around the world this year — “to get a different type of education,” she said
— before going on to graduate school to study analytical chemistry as it applies to the environment.

J.W. Nelson Chandler of Hemingway, S.C., a history major with a concentration in Southern Studies, attained second honors and was
also named magna cum laude. He will attend law school at the University of Virginia this year.

In addition, two professors received the Hunter-Hamilton Love of Teaching Award — Anthony Abbott of the English department and Donald
Kimmel of the biology department.

The most popular major for the Class of 1997 was biology, with 72 students. English (63), history (57), political science
(42), and psychology (37) rounded out the top five.

1997 grad wins Fulbright

Sallie Permar, who graduated with honors in biology in May, received a Fulbright Fellowship for a ten-month study of the
epidemiology of Kaposi’s sarcoma, an HIV-related cancer, at the University of Zambia Medical School. Permar, a Raleigh native, traveled to
Zambia in the summer of 1996 as well, conducting research on malnutrition in preschool-age children at the Mwandi Christian Hospital.
She is one of 1,600 U.S. grantees selected this year to travel abroad under the Fulbright Program, which is designed
“to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and the people of other countries.”

At Davidson, Permar was chair of the Project Life bone marrow drive, Student Solicitor for the Honor Council, and a
member of the track and cross country teams. She received the college’s Tom Daggy Biology Award in 1997, and has
worked in research labs at Davidson, North Carolina State, and Duke. Permar will attend the Johns Hopkins University School of
Public Health to obtain a Ph.D. in immunology and microbiology following her work in Zambia.

Novelist Patricia Cornwell gives $1 million endowment

Award-winning crime novelist Patricia Cornwell, a 1979 graduate who has funded scholarships for promising writers at Davidson since 1992, presented
the college with a $1-million endowment in late May. Cornwell, who five years ago created the Patricia Cornwell Scholarships at
Davidson as merit awards for entering students with exceptional ability and potential in writing, credits Davidson’s professors for nurturing and
encouraging her career. She is the youngest alumnus or alumna to ever make a gift of this size to the
college.

Cornwell made the gift at this time to honor Kuykendall. “Education is our only hope for civility, and the enlightened
young must lead the way,” she said. “With this gift, I thank Dr. John and Missy Kuykendall and all of
the Davidson faculty for their passion and humanity. You have led me well.” Kuykendall called the gift “a wonderful farewell
gift that ensures good writing will flourish at Davidson forever.”

Kresge Foundation offers grant for Life Sciences Building

The Kresge Foundation of Troy, Mich., issued in May a $750,000 challenge grant to assist in the completion of the
Watson Life Sciences Building. The college will receive the money if and when it raises the $2 million balance needed
for construction and endowment of the new facility by next August.

“The Kresge Challenge reinforces just how important it is for us to wrap up the fundraising for this project before
the building becomes operational in 1998,” new president Robert Vagt said. “Alumni and friends of the college need to know
that we will receive the challenge grant only if we are successful in meeting the goal. We are grateful to
the Kresge Foundation for offering the Davidson community this wonderful incentive.”

The foundation, which awarded grants totaling over $87 million in 1996, also issued grants towards the completion of Baker Sports
Complex and the Visual Arts Center.

Multiple summer construction projects give Davidson new lookBy Liz SALE, Staff Writer

Enduring North Carolina’s summer heat and humidity, the hard-working staff of the physical plant pushed forward with numerous projects. Some
are blatantly obvious and some remain unseen to the layman’s eye. Here’s a listing of projects that were done over
the summer or are currently underway:

**Arm of Doom**
A concern for pedestrian safety was the impetus to limiting vehicle access to dorm row. Only the police, fire department,
physical plant, and library staff (parking) will have authority to use the road. The project cost an estimated $18,000.

**The Union Ramp**
The curving ramp constructed on the Union patio was built to increase access to the building for wheelchair users. When
completed in late September, handrails will be in place along with automatic card access doors. The estimated price for this
job is $55,000.

**ROTC Conversion**
The College had a large need for student living space at the end of last year and converted ROTC offices
into dorm rooms over the summer. These rooms have all new wiring, internet access, new lights, and ceilings. The physical
plant created five new showers and expanded the existing bathrooms. Amazingly, all of this work was done within a month.

**Sentelle**
Sentelle may look the same from the outside, but internally, it is a new building. Physical plant staff put in
all new plumbing, wiring, internet access, and windows in every room. This building had not been renovated since its construction
six decades ago.

**President's House**
The president’s house had not had any major work done to it since 1959, but this summer the overhaul began.
The construction will add four rooms, renovate thirteen, and add an elevator. While they are at it, all new plumbing,
wiring, and internet access will be included. This project will be completed early next semester.

**Watson Science Building**
The 30 new lab and classroom spaces this building creates will be available for the 1998-1999 school year. The foundation
was poured this summer and plumbers are now hard at work. The estimated cost of this project is $12 million.

**Physical Plant Shops**
The new shops are located behind WDAV on Ridge Road. This building will allow more shops to be located together,
and Davidson will no longer need to rent space for its warehouse. All involved hope to have this project completed
by November at a cost of $450,000.

**Most dorms now wired**
By Liz SALE, Staff Writer

After much anticipation, most dorms are now wired for Internet access. Only Duke, Lingle, and the senior apartments lack the
internal wiring, and they will be wired by January 1998. The fiber optic lines connecting Duke, Lingle, and the senior
apartments are currently being installed. Each dorm will go online as the fiber optic connects it. The dorms will be
activated as follows: Belk, Richardson, Cannon, Watts, Little, Sentelle, Duke, Lingle, and senior apartments. The connection will hopefully be completed
by spring of this year.

Once the dorms are connected, Information and Technological Services will offer two different services to the World Wide Web. One
way to merge onto the information superhighway is via Ethernet. Unfortunately, though, every computer using it must be equipped with
a special Ethernet card. An Ethernet card is like a modem, but about 500 times faster and requires special wiring
and installation. Depending on the computer, the costs range from $70 to $150.

Another alternative is BellSouth.Net using a modem. ITS contracted with this provider to offer other options to students and staff.
BellSouth.Net offers three price plans: (1) 10 hours per month at $9.95 monthly with a one-time $10 hook-up fee; (2)
60 hours per month at $12.00 monthly with a $10 hook-up fee; and (3) unlimited hours at $19.95 monthly with
a hook-up fee. For more information about buying an Ethernet card or using BellSouth.Net, contact computer services at x2402 or
