Bonfire Built

Thursday the first-year men turned out and laid a mass of wood on the freshman field twelve feet high in
anticipation of a large bonfire. However, some unknown party set fire to it about midnight Thursday, burning it completely to
the ground. Cheerleader Dick Taylor sent out another plea Friday and the freshmen came to the rescue, stripping the neighborhood
of loose wood and trash.

At 7:30 Friday night the pep meeting was held at the new gymnasium proving to be the largest held so
far this year. Most of the student body attended, some with their dates. After the usual speeches and cheers, a
shirt tail parade led the procession to the field, ending up in a circle about the blaze. Here, after several
cheers, the strains of “On, Davidson” and “We’ll Fight for Old Davidson” were ringing through the woods.
