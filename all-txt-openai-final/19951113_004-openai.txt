Average GPA at Davidson a 3.094 | Ballard wins Chess Championship

Spring 1995

Seventeen of Davidson’s finest chess players battled over the weekend for the Davidson College Chess Championship. Senior John Ballard emerged
undefeated to win his second consecutive title.

Ballard, who two weeks ago placed second in the North Carolina Chess Championship, finished with a perfect 4-0 record. Coming
in second and third, respectively, were sophomore Vinod Thomas and freshman Gospodnetic. Thomas and Gospodnetic both went 3-1 in the
tournament, losing only to Ballard. Five players tied for fourth overall, but junior Thomas Wang won the tiebreaker to receive
the fourth place award.

By virtue of their performance in the Davidson Championship, Ballard, Thomas, Gospodnetic, and Wang are eligible to represent Davidson at
the 1995 Pan American Intercollegiate Chess Championship in New York City. The Pan Am is the premier event of collegiate
chess in the Western Hemisphere, and last year included teams from the United States, Canada, the Dominican Republic, and Peru.

Two years ago, the Davidson chess team, in its first year of existence, competed in the Pan Am and won
the National Small College Championship.

While Davidson did not send a team to last year’s Pan Am, Ballard did meet with success competing in Spanish
chess leagues. During his year abroad in Sevilla, Spain, Ballard went undefeated for his Sevillan team league and placed 30th
out of 78 in the expert division of the Sevillan individual championship. He also went 6-3 and tied for first
place for competitors under 21 years of age in the province of Alava. However, according to Ballard, his most exciting
experience came last April when he was one of 25 people who played simultaneous matches with the Spanish national champion.
The champion won almost every game but lost a grueling match to Ballard.

Town

from page 1

The town also discussed linking copiers and vending machines to CAT cards. Terry discussed the cost involved in hooking up
machines to phone lines.

The College also has a computer consultant looking at installing a new campus-wide fiber optics system. Terry suggested waiting until
that installation and building from it to save the large start-up cost.

Some of the Commons issues discussed were the availability of food for vegetarians, the back doors to the Commons being
locked, and the lighting in the dining room being too dark now that we are no longer on daylight savings
time.

Philips was very responsive to the needs of vegetarians and was open to any suggestions students had for new menu
items.

Philips said the doors were locked in order to prevent people from not using their meal plans and eating, which
the staff has seen people do.

Overall, there was a feeling that there has been a vast improvement in Commons service and willingness to work with
the students, as exemplified by two 99% health ratings and the new five meal plan.

The final issue discussed was the availability of laundry machines throughout the campus. Students have stated that they will not
pay for new machines because they feel that their laundry cost in their tuition should cover this.

The few machines that are on campus are old machines, given by the laundry, and are in need of repair.

Terry stated that the budget does not allow for the purchase of new machines, and that only a large increase
in efficiency in the laundry or some other savings plan would provide the money needed to purchase new machines.

Still, without more funding or cost-saving measures, it seems that the students will have to pay for any new laundry
machines placed on campus.

Gullan said, “The quality of discussion at these town meetings continues to be high. Those who come are really helping
the dialogue around here.

"And accessible administrators like Richard Terry are willing to listen; hence the new meal plan options, which are largely a
result of our new student advisory councils, and the kind of change enthusiastic, committed students can help affect.”
