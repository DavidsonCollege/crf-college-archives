**Davidson students host local trick-or-treaters in residence halls**

Witches, fairies, pirates, and princesses were among those who roamed campus on Thursday, October 26. But the witches were not after the fairies, and the pirates were not after the princesses. Instead, all were after full bags of candy.

The evening began around 5:30 p.m., when children poured from the Ada Jenkins Center buses to the area outside of KA. “Last year, some of the Ada kids didn’t get the chance to trick-or-treat, so we decided we’d give them the chance,” explained Seth Davis ‘02, coordinator of the Ada trick-or-treating project.

In the weeks preceding the big event, several halls raised money to outfit the Ada children with costumes of their own choosing. In the new costumes, the children circled from house to house on Patterson Court, meeting students and candy bars at each stop. “The people on Patterson Court really came through and were there,” commends Davis. “They were very gracious.”

Around 7 o'clock that evening, the campus prepared for another wave of trick-or-treaters. Families of the faculty, staff, and community gathered on the lawn outside Belk to hear stories told by Officer Lynch, Assistant Director of Public Safety, and to consume cookies, cupcakes, and drinks before heading for the dorms. Twenty-six halls, both up and down the hill, opened their doors and set out their candy bowls for the children. RLO coordinator Erin Domagalski estimates that 100 children and their families, if not more, tricked and treated through the buildings.

Some students decorated their halls with spider webs, streamers, and pumpkins, and others dressed themselves in costumes to welcome the trick-or-treaters. “A lot of people would leave their doors open and would talk with the kids and the parents as they came by,” recounts Rebecca Moore ‘03. The mother of an Indian appreciated the communication too, saying “It’s fun to see the interaction between the students and the kids.”

Children approached the process of candy gathering with different tactics. Some kneeled before each container of candy, carefully choosing the flavor that would most please their palates. A Revolutionary War soldier expressed his concern for the variety of flavors available in the bowl, inquiring, “Do you see Boo, page 4.”

**Chambers bell sets nostalgic tone**

Time passes as quickly as the falling leaves at Davidson, and few yield time to notice. But like a poet whose voice will not be forgotten, the Chambers bell beckons us to listen to the past. More than just a call to go to class, this bell remains a piece of our history, a cast-iron symbol that will not crumble away under our feet.

It reminded us of its presence after fall break, when it suddenly started to ring again. Freshmen on campus were startled at this foreign sound, while upperclassmen quickly identified their old friend. “It scared me the first time I heard it,” said Jonathan Schellack ‘04, speaking for many of his classmates. Yet those who have been here longer have a more founded understanding of what this place should mean to them, guarding the bell closer to their hearts. “It reminds you of Davidson every time you hear it,” said Randy Skattum ‘01. “It gives the school a nostalgic feel,” said David Johnston ‘01. Not forgetting its practicality, Christiane Buuck ‘01 pointed out that “it keeps professors honest.”

The story of the bell carries more time than the bell itself, and although the sound we hear today hasn’t resounded over the whole century, it embodies the tradition of yesteryear. The original bell was installed in 1858 with the construction of the first Chambers building, and when it burned to the ground on November 18, 1921, the bell crashed from its noble height. Pieces of the reshaped bell rest in Little Library, waiting to be seen.

After its demise, and before a replacement was built, the school employed several cre-ative means of herding students to class. First, a steam whistle was used, and later, a fire engine bell. Many students felt that these methods didn’t capture the honor of the old bell, and wanted a permanent replacement.

Campus comes alive for first-ever debates

It was, to say the very least, a historic night. Last Wednesday, October 25, the Young Democrats and the College Republicans held the first political debate in the college’s history. For nearly an hour, the party representatives discussed the major issues of this year’s election according to the campaign platforms of the respective candidates.

The debate was held between historic Eumenean and Philanthropic Halls - more commonly regarded as “Eu” and “Phi” Halls. In the tradition of the Eumenean Debate Society of decades past, the participants were located on the balconies of the two lecture halls—The Young Democrats on Phi Hall and the College Republicans on Eu Hall. Unlike in times past, microphones were used during the debate to prevent the contest from degenerating into a shouting match.

President Bobby moderated the debate. Seven major issues of the 2000 presidential campaign were discussed: education policy, healthcare policy, judicial appointment, budget surplus, environmental policy, social security and Medicare, and military policy. For each policy issue, a representative from each party presented and defended their respective candidate’s side. Each side was allotted five minutes to present the candidate’s position on the issue, followed by the rebuttals from both sides. The opening statements were prepared beforehand, while all rebuttals were on-the-spot responses, requiring a keen understanding of each candidate’s stance.

The debate focused primarily on policy initiatives Al Gore and George W. Bush would pursue as president. Each side aimed at showing a definitive divide between the two candidates. One of the most controversial issues, for example, was judicial appointments. Dan Carman ‘01, speaking for the College Republicans, noted Bush’s stance on choosing...

Students have grown fond of Chambers bell as it cuts their professors’ lectures short. So on September 14, 1922, the Honorable F. Brevard McDowell of the class of 1869 presented the gift of a new bell to the school as a memorial to alumni dead in World War I. The inscription reads: “In memory of our soldier dead, ‘To you from failing hands we throw the torch; Be yours to hold it high.’”

The bell’s ring is made possible by a series of intricate steps created by the International Time Recording Company (now IBM) in 1922 when the new Chambers was built. The official time is kept by a master clock found on the building’s first floor. This pendulum, weight-driven clock sends out a signal every minute to subsidiary “slave clocks” that keep time for the school. The master clock also sends a signal to a programmed switchboard that relays a message to the bell causing it to ring at timed intervals. The bell then rings for a full minute at the beginning and end of each class — in theory. Sometimes the bell goes for months without making a sound.

“It’s just getting old and it’s hard to keep it ringing,” said caretaker Jimmy Freeze of the Physical Plant. The bell didn’t echo off the red brick buildings of campus for the first part of this semester as it was eagerly anticipating repair parts from Germany. But here we find the excitement of the venerable Chambers bell.
