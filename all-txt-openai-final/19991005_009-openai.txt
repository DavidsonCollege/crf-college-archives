Body Depression: Have you noticed it?
By Ed Diggins AND YOLANDA Kirsy
Student Health Advisors

As health advisors, we are expected to inform the student body of important health issues. We are also an option of support, in addition to our wonderful counseling center. In this respect, we are often called upon for personal, informal counseling sessions with other students. Here is an example of one such happening.

Earlier this week, we Health Advisors had our weekly meeting, during which I was informed that it was my turn to write the article. Fear immediately seized me as I began to consider possible topics to write about. In search of a topic, I wandered around campus looking for something worth writing about. Unfortunately, our campus didn’t seem to motivate me much, so I decided to head for the Union and cheer myself up with a steaming cup of Starbucks pre-brewed coffee.

On the way, I noticed some signs advertising the National Depression Screening Day Thursday, October 7. Depression seemed to fit my feelings about writing this article, so I figured why not write about something I know. I thought it appropriate to focus on the signs of depression, but then what would I say? Maybe I could get some help from other students. So I continued on my path to the Union, trying to stage the depressed student.

In the Union, I was surprised by some of the comments I received from passers-by. “Lighten up, Yo!” someone said while patting me on the back. “Why can’t she just be normal?” I heard someone mutter. “Get a life, loser,” a couple yelled as I slumped past their booth. Now I really was frustrated because I still had nothing to write, and the world seemed to be turning against me. So I got my steaming cup of Starbucks pre-brewed and sat outside the Union, being annoyed by all of the seemingly happy people walking around with no work to do.

After a while, I ran into Ed Diggins, an old friend and ex-health advisor. I decided to share my problem with him and see what help he might give. “Looky here Yolanda, you gotta either [expletive] or get off the pot. You have [expletive] to do, I have [expletive] to do, we all have [expletive] to do. So don’t come [expletiving] to me cause you can’t hang, okay?” And with that, he walked off.

“Hey Ed,” I called after him sensing that maybe he had a problem bigger than mine. “You think you have a problem!” he shouted. I sat back down sensing a possible end to my article topic search. “What's wrong with you?” I posed.

“This school sucks,” he responded half-heartedly. “Oh, is it really that bad? What seems to be the problem?” He sat down next to me, chugged at his own hot mug of pre-brewed and began. “Nothing’s goin’ right,” he said. “I just got a paper back and scrawled across it was the biggest, reddest ‘D’ I’ve ever seen. On top of that, I haven’t had a decent meal in two days because of this stupid paper. Sleep — sleep is non-existent, and I don’t see that changing since I have two more papers and an exam due this week. I just don’t want to be here or anywhere else anymore.”

“You're right, that does sound like a heavy load. Have you talked to anyone about this? Are you close to your roommate?” I asked.

“My roommate!! David isn’t helping at all. I told him about all the work I had to do, and he told me that I whine too much. I asked him to help me study, and he asked if I had PMS!! I really knew I was worthless when he told me that life’s not fair and I need to get a hobby or something.”

“Sounds like you might benefit from a trip to the counseling center for a confidential meeting. As a matter of fact, did you know that there is a Depression Screening happening at the Union next Thursday, October 7?”

Ed kind of listened for a minute longer and then excused himself. I didn’t realize that depression would show its ugly face at Davidson like that. The occurrence of depression amongst college students is actually rather high. The National Institute of Mental Health estimated 17 million adult Americans suffer from depression during any one year period. Depression is often mistaken for occasional sadness, which I am sure we have all experienced here at Davidson.Difference is sadness usually doesn’t last long, whereas one sign of depression is when sadness lasts more than two weeks. Some other telling signs of depression are changed sleeping patterns (this may be hard to identify in a Davidson student, especially around the time of finals), speaking or moving unusually slowly or quickly, fatigue and loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness, and thoughts of death. Some people who suffer from depression stop participating in activities they used to enjoy. Others blame themselves for these feelings of hopelessness; some experience thoughts of death and suicide. If you notice these things in a friend or yourself, the best thing to do is talk to somebody about it. Depression has biological and psychological components, and seeking help will help identify these symptoms properly. As I mentioned before, the Health Center is a great place to go. The worst thing you could do is assume that the situation will take care of itself. Depression can be a scary situation but it can be treated successfully if you seek professional help. I would encourage everyone to take the depression screening test this week. It can be taken in the Davidsonian, on the Web, at the Student Health Center, or at a table in the Union. For those interested in more depression reading material, there are pamphlets available in the Health Center and numerous sites on the web (a few good ones are listed below).

Continued from previous page before moving back to the Pacific Northwest a decade later to pursue glass production full time. Glasswork traditionally has been conceived by a designer, and then fabricated by a master craftsman. The studio glass movement changed that by allowing the artist to work directly with the material. Chihuly works with a team of highly skilled glass blowers, but no longer blows glass himself as he lost depth perception in an auto accident in 1976. “When I was the gaffer, I had much less control than I do now,” remarked Chihuly. “I compare my role to that of a film director. Having the best cameraman allows me to move in and around the set.”

“I used to think that it was the glass that was so mysterious, and then I discovered that it was the air that went into it that was so miraculous,” stated Chihuly. “I often wonder how anyone ever thought of the idea of blowing air into molten glass. It doesn’t work with any other material.”

The majority of Dale Chihuly: Installations will be presented in the 6,000 square feet of gallery space on the second floor that housed both the previous Harvey Littleton and White House Craft exhibitions. Chihuly blown glass will also be installed in other public areas, including the mezzanine and lobby. The Mint Museum of Craft + Design is located at 220 North Tryon Street, Charlotte, NC. Admission is $6 for adults and $4 for seniors and students, and free for members and children 12 years and under. Hours are Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday 10am-7pm; Friday 10am-9pm and Sunday 12-5pm. For information or programs at either Mint Museum, call anytime at (704) 337-2000.
