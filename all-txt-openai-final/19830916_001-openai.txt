THE DAVIDSONIAN
Volume LXXIII, Number 1
Friday, September 16, 1983

By ELIZABETH WHITE

Southern Bell representatives surprised Davidson students last week with a new sign-up system that left many frustrated and some without
phones when the representatives closed at 6:30 on September 7. Students not getting phones on Tuesday and Wednesday were informed
that they had to go to a Charlotte phone center to arrange for service. Thirty-seven students made the trip to
Charlotte as of September 13. Problems with the supply of phones, mixed-up numbers, and a delay in activating the phones
also occurred this year, mainly due to changes in the Southern Bell organization.

Southern Bell representative Sharon Roberts said the problem stemmed from a change in Bell’s corporate structure. Southern Bell moved Davidson
sign-ups to another department, putting Roberts in charge of handling Davidson for the first time. Roberts devised a new plan
to avoid the long lines of previous years. She estimated the number of phones needed based on past figures and
on figures from other colleges. She decided to assign numbers so students could gauge how long they would have to
wait. Only three Bell representatives came to process the applications because she wanted to use a minimal number of employees.
The first day of sign-ups was not as busy as expected, but the second day was very heavy. By Wednesday
afternoon at 6:30 the three representatives had handled 332 orders and there were still people in line. Roberts felt that
not enough students remained to return on Thursday. The remaining students were told they would have to go into Charlotte
to get their phones.

SGA President Hunter Monroe was the next person up in line when they closed Wednesday night. He described himself as
“very mad” after waiting all afternoon only to be turned away when he made it to the front. Monroe was
one of the 37 who went to Charlotte to get service. Director of Student Housing Bill Bolding said the new
representatives did not feel the need to go over plans for the sign-up with him as in previous years. Originally,
representatives took no applications for perimeter housing, but Bolding talked them into it. On Tuesday morning, students who had never
had service were being charged a minimum $90 deposit which most could not cover. Bob Stevenson of the Davidson Personnel
Department contacted Southern Bell immediately and explained that a verbal agreement was made several years ago not to charge any
deposits. Roberts ordered her representatives to stop charging deposits and deposits already paid were returned.

Another problem arose when different students were assigned the same phone numbers. Phone numbers were dedicated to rooms in 1981.
In 1982 the College changed some room numbers, so new phone numbers were reassigned. This year, the lists were mixed
up, and several students were given the same numbers. This problem and the summer strike caused the delay in activating
the phones.

Southern Bell Frustrates Students In Phone Foul-Up

By DAN VOORHIS

Davidson's planned conversion to the semester system progressed over the summer when the Faculty approved a calendar for the 1984-85
school year. However, the College must still resolve important issues before the changes take place.

Under the new calendar, Davidson would have two terms of fifteen weeks each with six days for exams. Reading days
would be dropped. The plan, passed in June after much debate, starts classes on August 28. The first term has
a four-day midterm break October 13-16 and two days off at Thanksgiving. The semester ends on December 21 for Christmas
vacation. Studies resume January 14 after a three-week break. The spring semester’s midterm break lasts March 8-18. With Good Friday,
April 5, off, the year ends May 14. Graduation ceremonies take place May 19.

Adopting this calendar may end much of last year’s debate over term and exam period length despite persisting problems such
as the credit-hour system, area and graduation requirements. A subcommittee of the Educational Policy Committee will study these problems and
make recommendations.

**SGA Implementation Committee**

The SGA Semester Implementation Committee submitted a proposal last spring to lengthen the exam period to seven days preceded by
two reading days. This proposal allows for the possibility of five classes per semester.

**Physical Plant Renovates Campus**

By ANDY CLARK and GREG SMOUSE

The Physical Plant spent over $200,000 this summer as it renovated, redecorated, and improved rundown parts of the campus over
the summer, according to Director of the Physical Plant Grover Meetze.

The Watts bathrooms now house four tiled shower stalls instead of two and three enclosed toilets. Each floor lost half
a room to create extra space for the refurbished baths. This summer Cannon Hall underwent its first major mechanical repairs
since the 1920s. Subflooring rotted from past water fights was replaced and covered with linoleum. Wiring was upgraded to accommodate
the demands of hairdryers and stereos. Also, the heating system was entirely replaced. For cost efficiency, each room now has
an individual thermostat. The system is designed so that air conditioning may be added in the future. Cosmetic work to
Cannon involved the installation of Levelor blinds in all of the dorm’s windows.

The physical plant built a walkway leading from the front of Chambers to the west entrance of Belk. Many bricks
were also replaced in other sidewalks. After twenty years of interrupted planning, the Physical Plant and Planning Committee finally installed
a pipe to channel the creek which ran through Patterson Court. The stream now flows underground through 20-foot sections of
four-foot diameter pipe. The stream’s encasement was necessary according to College Maintenance Engineer Philip Cashion because of the steep banks
that limited lawn mower maneuverability and produced what Cashion refers to as “mud tyler” or what some students call a
“snoo hole.” The stream banks became so soft that they kept falling into the stream making a mess of the
surrounding land.

The stream project is part of a program to further beautify the area behind the Commons. About two years ago
a power line that once ran along the creek was removed and relocated to circle behind the fraternities. No major
problems accompanied this project. Some water seepage occurred in Fannie and Mable’s basement, but that accident has not been linked
to the change in the drainage system.

Student suggestions and requests prompted these renovations.
