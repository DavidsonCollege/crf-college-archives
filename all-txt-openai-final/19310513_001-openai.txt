**Pres. H. E. Rondthaler Speaks at Exercises Of O. D. K. Fraternity**

**“Spirit of Imagination Kindled” is Topic for Address by Salem College President**

**BANQUET GIVEN NEW MEN**

**Dr. Rondthaler Says Force of Imagination Makes Studies Interesting**

“The things which endure in one’s education cannot always be gotten from the books studied, but are generally secured by something which I have called the ‘spirit of imagination,’” said Dr. Howard E. Rondthaler, president of Salem College, Winston-Salem, in speaking at the open initiation exercises of Omicron Delta Kappa, national honorary leadership society, at Davidson College. “The one thing which I would add to my educational curriculum is this vital imagination, this force that will bring out the living things in each subject, and will carry the student, impellingly, on into the subject, enlarging and stimulating his mental process,” said the noted educator. Dr. Rondthaler “reminisced” with his audience over his early schooling, his first lesson learned in a small basement room, with chanted exercises, old fashioned punishments, under an old maid school teacher. Then he spoke of his higher work, in a room a century old when he studied in it, a room which George Washington had visited. Then finally his college days. “But,” continued the speaker, “the most important, single vital factor of my education I did not find until later. It is this ‘Spirit of Imagination Kindled.’ I wish it could be that every man could have this by his side as he enters a new subject, and let (Continued on page 4)

**Members of Court Elected by Council**

**Raker is President of 1931-32 “D” Club**

At a recent meeting of the “D” Club, the officers for next year were chosen. L. S. Raker was elected president, to succeed Hub Covington. H. S. Brown was made vice-president, and P. M. Conway was elected secretary and treasurer. Raker is a member of the Kappa Alpha social fraternity, first sergeant in the R. O. T. C. department, member of the Student Council for next year, letter man in both football and wrestling, and won his Freshman numeral in football. Brown made his letter last year in football, and is a member of both the basketball and track teams. For the past year Brown was one of the vice-presidents of the Athletic Association. In his Freshman year he made his numeral in football. Through his exceptional football ability he was made All-State end for the past season. P. M. Conway is a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon social fraternity, was elected business manager of the Davidsonian for next year, made his letter in wrestling, and was captain of this year’s wrestling team, first sergeant in R. O. T. C. unit, secretary and treasurer of Scabbard and Blade, and was recently elected vice-president of the North Carolina Collegiate Press Association.

**R. O. T. C. Unit Given “Excellent” Rating**

Notification has been received by the R. O. T. C. department of Davidson College that the local unit has again been awarded the “excellence” rating by the War Department for its work this year, announced Lieut. Col. W. R. Scott, commandant of the local unit, today. This rating is based on the results of the inspection conducted here two or three weeks ago by the War Department inspectors. This makes the sixth consecutive year that the Davidson corps has received the highest ranking given by the War Department to R. O. T. C. units. Davidson’s military department was designated as “distinguished” for two years while that ranking was used, and for the past three years has enjoyed the top ranking by being named “excellent,” under the new system of rating now used. Col. Scott said that Davidson's percentage this year was the highest ever given it by the War Department, and that the inspectors were particularly high in their praise of the local unit.

**Annual “Mother’s Day” Program is Conducted by Mrs. Robert Glasgow**

**Nat Spier, H. S. Covington, and Bob Gorrell Assist in Carrying Out Program**BY MRS. VOWLES

Moral, Mental, and Physical Strength in Life is Stressed

A special “Mother's Day” program was held at the regular vesper hour last Sunday afternoon. Nat G. Speir read a few verses from the 31st chapter of Proverbs. Hub S. Covington and Bob W. Gorrell prayed, and Mrs. G. R. Vowles sang a lullaby. Mr. Speir, in introducing Mrs. Robert Glasgow of Charlotte, said that she is peculiarly fitted to speak to Davidson men on the program because she is the mother of three boys and a good friend of the college. Mrs. Glasgow, in beginning her talk, declared that it is a privilege to come to Davidson and speak. Stating that she was going to talk to the boys as their mothers talked to them, she radiated personality and maintained this sympathetic attitude from the beginning to the end. She asserted that mothers’ feelings are universal in that they all have the same hopes, desires, and dreams for their children. It is a rare occurrence to find a family circle that is not broken, continued Mrs. Glasgow, and those fortunate people that enjoy this unity should realize how blessed they are. The speaker claimed that mothers know that they are often deficient, but how anxious they are to improve and give their offspring the same advantages that other children enjoy!

Mrs. Glasgow differs with Dean Inge of St. Paul’s Cathedral, who believes that humanity today is harmless and everybody tries to be happy and simply have a good time. She considers “He” men needed more now than ever before and asks where they will come from if they don’t come from Davidson with its environment and great background. According to some people, the way (Continued on page 4)

RECITAL ON SKINNER GIVEN BY DR. M. C. BALDWIN

Five Men Initiated By Phi Beta Kappa

The Phi Beta Kappa initiation was held Friday night at 7:30 o'clock. This fraternity is the first of American Greek letter fraternities and recognizes scholarship. The men initiated were: Paul R.

C.; Albert Wallace Cowan, B.S. 1, Bristol, Tenn.; John Wilson McCutchan, A.B. 2, Warm Springs, Va.; and Dean Rusk, A.B. 2, Atlanta, Ga.

Officers for Class Day Exercises are Elected

ORGAN RECITAL BY DR. M. C. BALDWIN

Famous Artist Received by Largest Audience Ever to Attend Recital at Davidson

IS INTERNATIONALLY KNOWN

Many Request Numbers Rendered Among Regular Selections on Program

On Wednesday night, May 6, Dr. Minor C. Baldwin, organist of international fame, gave an organ recital on the Skinner organ in Chambers Auditorium. Dr. Baldwin's selections, some of which were request numbers, included the following:

Toccata and Fugue in D Minor—Bach,
Reverie—His own composition,
Two movements from Siciliana and Presto from Bonnet’s Organ Concerto,
Two movements from the G Major Suite of Bach,
His own arrangements of Schubert. This arrangement, which made Dr. Baldwin famous, brought forth more applause than any other number of the recital.
Meditation—By himself,
Am Meer by Schubert,
Selections from the opera Il Trovatore by Verdi,
Selections from Semiramide Overture of Rossini,
Variations on the hymn tune, “God Be With You 'Til We Meet Again,”
And as an encore, his arrangement of Dixie.

Dr. Baldwin's color effects on the organ were so subtle that it acquired fame as Am Meer. In his rendition of Am Meer, he brought forth effects of waves rippling on the sea sands. Though Dr. Baldwin's technical skill is not perfect, due to his age, he compensates for that by his varied colorful shadings that he adds to his selections. The famous organist was well received by the largest audience ever to attend an organ recital of any kind at Davidson.

A. H. Whitehead Succeeds J. A. Cannon as New Head of Pan-Hellenic Council

Banquet Will Be Given to Retiring Council by Newly Elected Group

During the past week the election of the Pan-Hellenic Council for the year was completed. The new officers were elected with the result that Allen Whitehead, a member of the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity, is the coming president, and Ed Kuykendall, of Kappa Sigma, is secretary and treasurer.
