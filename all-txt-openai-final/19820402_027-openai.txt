**The Diamond’s Looking Better**

The Davidson College baseball diamond is beginning to sparkle, even when the sun doesn’t shine. With first-year skipper George Greer at the helm, the Wildcats have navigated their way to an 8-8 record so far, an improvement over last year’s record at this point. But improvements in baseball aren’t the only things going down just south of Iredell County.

For those of you who haven’t taken it upon yourselves to walk a few hundred yards to soak some rays while watching what has become some typically exciting (if not always winning) baseball, you’re missing an improvement in facilities rivaling that of the food service. To begin with, Greer, along with Buddy Robbins and his hard-working crew, have moved the scoreboard close enough that binoculars are no longer required to follow the score and idle players no longer have to run a mini-marathon to post the score. It’s now close enough to notice the lights on the scoreboard, and anyone wanting to work it for a game or a season is welcome. Workers have painted the dugouts and bleachers, and the scoreboard is next to befall the honors of the brush. The field itself is looking better as well, thanks to some extra-curricular work by the team.

But once you get down there you’ll want to watch baseball, so you may need to know how they’re doing.

Thursday the team ran into a tough Fairleigh-Dickinson squad that it could have beaten but didn’t. Junior Ed Whitesides was making his first start, and his first inning was shaky. “We played poorly in the first inning and gave up four runs,” said Greer, but after that, Whitesides settled down to pitch well. The Cats cut the game to one run in the bottom of the seventh and had men on first and second with one down, but the bats couldn’t capitalize.

“We should have won 7-4. Those four runs came back to haunt us,” as the Cats dropped an exciting 7-8 game.

The next day went better against Fairmont State of West Virginia. In the first game of a twin-billing, the Cats entered the bottom of the seventh (college games are only seven innings apiece in doubleheaders) with the score tied 5-5. Chip Fishback led off the inning with a single to bring Allen Griffin to the plate. Griffin’s .417 batting average last year ranked 34th nationally, but the Fairmont hurler took no note and fired in a high fastball. Beaver got all of it and hit a booming 410 ft. shot over dead center to win the game, 7-5.

In the second game, junior Bobby Barnes turned in a shutout with a marvelous pitching effort. Greer praised the team effort as well, “We played well defensively. Bobby pitched well and we did all the little things we need to do to score runs.” One of the “little things” was shortstop Griffin’s second homer of the day, coming in the third inning.

Marshall turned the tables on Saturday as they overpowered the Cats 16-4 and 10-0 in a doubleheader. The main problem with Davidson was Marshall. “They’re physically big and very strong. When they hit the ball, they hit with authority,” Greer said. “We could have played better and didn’t,” he continued.

The Thundering Herd should be in the thick of the championship race according to Greer. “They’re two deep at each position, have good base speed, and homerun power.”

On Monday the Cats bore down to play their fifth and sixth games in four days and split with Gardner-Webb.

In the first game, Davidson pretty much sank its own ship as the team stranded several baserunners to lose 4-3. “We did not hit in the clutch—that’s the whole gist of the problem,” said Greer. “The second and fourth runs Gardner-Webb scored came on errors—they were unearned runs.”

The nightcap was Davidson’s, however, as they won in extra innings. Bobby Barnes got the start and pitched 5 2/3 innings of one-run ball when he left. “He pitched a complete game Friday and was going with only three days rest. He just got tired,” Greer commented. Rusty Colechia came in for relief and gave up the tying runs in 1 1/3 innings, when the Cats came up in the eighth. Catcher Phil Gordon lashed out a ground rule double and advanced to third on a passed ball by the catcher. Mick Smith stood in at the plate and lined the game-winning ribby to right center.

**Recruiting**

Coach Greer has brought to baseball the same kind of positive attitude Bobby Hussey brought to basketball, and part of that includes recruiting. At this point, nothing is definite until Admissions lets the prospects in, but according to Greer, “Right now we have some kids who can play and can help us.” He’s selling “a chance to play in a beautiful ballpark and a quality institution.”

The schedule gives the pitchers a well-earned rest as the next game is Saturday at Wake Forest. Tuesday the Cats host Pfeiffer and Wednesday night at 7:00 they travel to Crockett Park in Charlotte to meet archrival UNCC.
