The Davidson sailing team
unexpectedly will host one set of
the South Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing
Association (SAISA) eliminations this Saturday,
April 12.

The regatta results will determine the teams
which will compete in the championships of the SAISA, the conference to which the Davidson
sailing team belongs.

The eliminations were to have
been held this past weekend at
the University of Virginia.

Several teams, including
Davidson, attempted to sail in
very strong winds at Virginia on
both April 5 and 6. However,
three of Virginia’s six boats
were dismasted by the powerful
gusts, so that only three boats
remained to accommodate the
teams from five schools.

Consequently, the
eliminations were postponed
until this weekend. The Davidson
team volunteered to host
the regatta at the Davidson lake
campus.

Teams from five schools will
compete in these eliminations.
In addition to the Davidson
sailors, teams from UNC, Duke,
Virginia, and Old Dominion will
sail.

Davidson team captain Dave
Francis said that he will skipper for Davidson in the “A”
Division of the eliminations.
Chuck Barrineau will be Davidson’s skipper in the “B”
Division. Francis stated that
crews have not yet been selected for Davidson in either
division.

The five teams in this Saturday’s eliminations will vie for
the top three places. These
three teams will be eligible for
the championship regatta of the
SAISA.

Already eligible for this conference championship are the
teams from the Citadel, Clemson, and the College of
Charleston, which emerged as
the top three teams in a different set of eliminations successfully completed this past
weekend at a site different from
that of the Virginia fiasco.

Francis expressed, on behalf
of the Davidson team, a
welcome to anybody interested
to go to the lake campus Saturday to watch the regatta. He
added enticingly, “If it’s a pretty
day, we’ll have a keg of beer
out there.”

UNC takes NCC golf title,
Reni leads Cats with low 79

The Davidson College Golf
Team placed “somewhere near
the middle” in the North
Carolina Collegiate golf tournament played Mon. and Tues.
at the Pawtuckett Country
Club, according to coach Tom
Scott.

The tournament, the third
this spring for the Davidson
Golfers, was won by Tom Barnes of Atlantic Christian with a
two-day total of 149.

The team title was taken by
the University of North
Carolina with a two-day total of
610 while UNC-Charlotte was
second with 614.

The Collegiate was the third
tournament this spring for the
Davidson golfers. In their two
previous outings, the Red Fox
Tournament played in Charlotte and the Furman Invitational;
the Cats finished 15th out of 15
teams and 24th out of 25 teams,
respectively.

Both tournaments were won
by the University of East Tennessee, one of the top teams in
the country.

On Monday, Senior Bob Reni
had the low round for Davidson
shooting a 77. Senior Richard
Anderson was low man on
Tuesday with a 79. Randy Hunter (75), Bill Coleman (76),
Craig Culbertson (77), and Mike
Lanio (78) are the other members of the team.

Thus far, the team has come
up against some extremely
tough competition. “All the
teams we’ve faced thus far
have been tougher than us,”
Scott said.

He cited the loss of two of last
year’s top six, Grant Whitney
who transferred to Wake Forest
and Jerry Horne who transferred to the University of Georgia, as one reason for the team’s
lack of success thus far.

“This year, we have an
altogether new club,” said
Scott.

In addition, Scott stated that
not having scholarships to offer,
coupled with not having a
course nearby, hurts the team
considerably.

The team practices at the
Country Club of Charlotte which
is a 40-mile round trip for an afternoon’s practice.

“Not only is this a great
distance to travel,” said Scott.
“But, in terms of time, it’s a
great demand to make on any of
the boys.”

The team is usually able to
practice twice a week.

For the present, Scott hopes
to give the team “lots of tournament exposure. We’ve had
much tough competition thus
far; this is invaluable experience.”

The team meets defending
Southern Conference champion
Appalachian in Charlotte next
Tuesday, and will play in the
Southern Conference Tournament April 21-23 at the Country Club of South Carolina.

Scott hopes that added tournament exposure and practice
will have the team ready. “I’m
looking to a 4th or 5th place
finish,” said Scott.
