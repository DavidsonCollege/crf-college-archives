Dancing outside the box: NCDT shines on stage

By Kristen Taylor

The North Carolina Dance Theatre (NCDT) remains a tour-de-force. As Amanda Lanier, head of the Union Board Artists Series Committee,
puts it, “Bringing NCDT to Davidson is a real coup.”

Friday’s show opened with “Duo Concertant,” choreographed by Artistic Director Jean-Pierre Bonnefoux to the music of Igor Stravinsky. The program
explained that the piece “celebrates the art of partnering.” Well-matched Traci Gilchrest and Hernan Justo kept a spontaneous flow of
movement. At certain intervals, they walked to the area where violinist Eun-Sun Lee and pianist Anna Brock played and respectfully
listened, expanding the partnership metaphor between the two dancers and the dancers and the music.

The second piece, “Syrinx,” also choreographed by Jean-Pierre Bonnefoux, spotlighted Kati Hanlon appropriately accompanied by a lilting flute. A siren,
Hanlon’s green eyes flashed, and the calculated style with which she worked the stage proved a sharp contrast to the
freer first piece. Ms. Hanlon’s gaze only left the audience to be directed at Amy Blumenthal, playing Debussy’s famous work
for solo flute. A series of stylized grande battements ended the piece, toying with an audience that wanted a longer
time with Hanlon.

Another standout piece of the evening was “Beethoven Sonata.” Amy Earnest sparkled as a woman torn between her love for
dance and the restrictions her partner placed upon her. Her impassioned face carried the piece to a level that also
examined the art of partnership. At times reminiscent of the film “The Red Shoes,” Ms. Earnest primarily seemed a modern
Coppelia, boxed in by her partner like a doll. Mark Diamond’s vibrant choreography emphasized a motif of the male’s arm
pushing their female partners in front of her face. Towards the end, Ms. Earnest adopted this move with another woman.
This piece reflects even more deeply the relationship between two dancers that are partners, collaborators.

Paul Taylor’s classic “Esplanade” closed the strong program. The skin-toned costumes allowed the audience to focus on the real message
of the piece, the constant re-creation and invention of dance. In the first movement, the upbeat music matches the dancers’
smiles as they athletically create “an exhilarating dance vocabulary.” In the second movement, however, the arms become rigid and inflexible,
the movements strained. The end of this movement shows the dancers moving in unison in a circle on all fours:
without artistic freedom, the dancers have been reduced to an animalistic state where movement becomes formulaic and contrived. In the
last movement, the music brightened once again and the dancers moved so freely that the audience laughed with them as
one dancer literally hopped and skipped over six prone dancers. Then the female dancers run and daringly jump into their
partner’s arms, defying gravity and the gasping audience’s expectations. The entire piece seemed to focus on pushing boundaries, and the
unparalleled choreography.of “Esplanade” remains fun with this powerful ensemble. NCDT’s athletic approach more than handled this well-known and important piece,
and with pure joy on their faces brought out the subtleties of Paul Taylor. How marvelous it will be when
the new Student Union is built, and Davidson can afford artists a stage on which they will not have to
rework blocking. Hodson’s stage seemed crowded in the last two numbers, the space barely accommodating the larger ensembles. Not often
a forum for professional ballet, Davidson was privileged to have hosted this elite ensemble.
