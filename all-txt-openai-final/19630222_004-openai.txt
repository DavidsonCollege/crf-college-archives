Earlier this year, W. H. Tilley, a new addition to the English department, outlined his views on this problem in a DAVIDSONIAN interview. Tilley was particularly interested in the problem of maintaining interdepartmental communication. This week, Political Science Instructor E. F. Miller, also a new member of the faculty, continued the discussion by presenting his opinions. At the same time, Miller was announcing his intention to leave the college at the end of this semester to take a position at Furman University. Miller has formed definite opinions on the future role of the college in his time here.

“I sense an indecisiveness about what sort of school Davidson should become, whether it should be merely a training ground for the professional schools or whether it should have a liberal arts program comparable to some of the finer mid-western and northern liberal arts colleges. I think there is a recognition that far-reaching changes in the curriculum must be made to give Davidson a high national standing.”

Citing the Humanities program as a step in the right direction, Miller nonetheless expressed the fear that it might not be able to achieve its high goals as a pioneer interdepartmental course. “It would be most unfortunate if the Humanities program became merely a facade behind which the real problems of interdepartmental communication and intellectual exchange were hidden. For Davidson to become a truly great liberal arts college, new ideas and approaches would have to be not merely tolerated but welcomed.”

Miller pointed out two reasons why he doubted that Davidson presently provides an atmosphere conducive to new ideas. “First, many students seem to have been conditioned to sit passively and take copious notes. They hesitate to confront the teacher with their questions and criticisms. Also, I notice the lack of an interdepartmental dialogue. I sense a fear on the part of some that if they commit themselves in areas outside their disciplines—in philosophy, history, or religion, for example—that they will be judged incompetent by their colleagues.”

Drama Day at Davidson College on March 1 will give students of drama and world literature an afternoon and evening of the theatre. The Vagabonds will present Elmer Rice’s Adding Machine at 4:30 p.m. in Hodson Hall. This will be followed by an informal snack supper and drama discussion with the Vagabonds as hosts in Chambers Banquet Hall. The highlight of the schedule will be the appearance of Dame Judith Anderson at 8:15 p.m. in Chambers Auditorium. This is her only appearance in North Carolina.

A special group rate per student covers admission to the Adding Machine, snack supper, and drama discussion. Reservations must be made before Feb. 26 by high school or college officials for groups of 10 or more. Only 250 students can be accommodated for this special program of modern and classic drama. Student groups will report to Hodson Hall immediately on their arrival on the Davidson campus. Group tickets for the three events will be held and distributed to the faculty leaders of the groups on March 1.

Dame Judith Anderson’s appearance at Davidson College on March 1 as star of “Lady Macbeth” and “Medea” will give theatregoers an opportunity to see the most celebrated performances of the “outstanding classical actress of the English-speaking stage.” The vengeful fury Medea is often considered one of the most demanding parts ever written for a woman. One critic in describing her performance said, “Her reservations earthquake. Then she builds to a climax.” Before Dame Judith opened the Jeffers-Euripides play, the idea of offering Greek drama to the American public was regarded as a dubious commercial venture. The opening night triumph, when the New York audience literally stood up and cheered, was a theatrical landmark. For the first time in modern America, a classic Greek drama was a solid box-office hit.

The “Medea” to be presented at Davidson College has been abridged to cut minor characters and speed the drama's violent action. This allows time for Dame Judith and three fellow actors to present “Lady Macbeth” as a first act. The star won two TV “Best Actress” Emmies for her dramatic study of ambition and murder in this role. Her performance concludes with the celebrated sleepwalking scene. Appearing as “Macbeth” and “Jason” opposite Dame Judith will be Lester Pinkerton.

Casting for the next major production of the Vagabonds, Elmer Rice’s The Adding Machine, which will be presented Feb. 27-March 2 in Hodson Hall, was announced this week. Zero is played by Pete Myers. The lead female roles of Mrs. Zero and Daisy are played by Mrs. Kay Winkler and Louise Hampton respectively. Louise Hampton is directing the play. Experimental, too, are the sets and lights. The sets will be silhouetted against a lighted grim background. Sidney Farrar, a freshman piano student, is writing and recording the music for the production. The night performances will be at 8:15 Feb. 27 and 28 and March 2. On Friday, March 1, there will be a matinee at 4:30, one of the features of Drama Day.

The following professors will hold open house for students after vespers this Sunday night: Mrs. Moore, White, H. E., Goodykoontz, Mebane, Tilley, Sailstad, McGill, Gallent, Anderson, and Meeks.

Hughes, pastor of the Home Moravian Church of Winston-Salem, will lead the vesper service Sunday night. The sophomores are reminded of their free cut. A native of Winston-Salem, Hughes received his BA degree from Moravian College of Bethlehem, Pa., in 1945, his BD from the Moravian Theological Seminary in 1947, and his DD from Moravian College in 1960. In 1947, he became the assistant pastor of the Home Moravian Church and remained there to become its minister in 1954.

Commented College Business Manager Robert Currie, “As the use of the area progresses, we will be in a position to know the priority of facilities needed. We will locate these facilities in accordance with a master plan. Martin also presented to the Trustees for their consideration two plans of curriculum scheduling, either of which, if eventually accepted, would radically change Davidson's traditional semester plan. In anticipation of the increasing numbers of college students in the next few years, one plan calls for a year-round scheduling of classes. This would permit more students to receive teaching in the course of a year without increasing the enrollment. This plan would also enable Davidson students to receive a degree in three years. The second plan also has in mind the rapid increase in college students, and suggests either the tri-semester or quarter plans which are now coming into greater use throughout the country. A Faculty-Trustee committee of purpose is now working on a report on the goals and purposes of the college, and a major self-study of the college is scheduled to begin this fall (required by the Southern Association of Colleges). “Such study will provide facts and recommendations which may be vital in the determination as to whether major changes should be made in Davidson’s program,” Martin added.

The experience is terrific, and it’s going to pay off whether or not I stay in the Army. From Fort Monmouth I can go to a play in New York one weekend, and visit Washington the next. On my officer's salary I can afford it. Of course I have an active social life on post, too. Officers’ club. Parties. Dances. You name it.

Let us examine that much maligned, widely misunderstood, overworked, wholly dedicated campus figure—the dean. He is a counselor and for the troubled student. The dean is characterized chiefly by sympathy, wisdom, patience, forbearance, and a fondness for homely pleasures like community singing, farina, spelldowns, and Marlboro Cigarettes. The dean (from the German Deangemachi—to poop a party) is fond of Marlboros for the same reason that all men of good will are fond of Marlboros—because Marlboro is an honest cigarette. Those good Marlboro tobaccos are honestly good, honestly aged to the peak of perfection, honestly blended for the best of all possible flavors. Marlboro honestly comes in two different containers—a soft pack which is honestly soft and a Flip-Top box which honestly flips. You too will flip when next you try an honest Marlboro, which, one honestly hopes, will be soon. But I digress. We were learning how a dean helps poor, troubled undergraduates. To illustrate, let us take a typical case from the files of Dean S...... of the University of Y..... (Oh, why be so mysterious? The dean’s name is Sigafoos and the University is Yutah.) Wise, kindly Dean Sigafoos was visited one day by a freshman named Walter Aguincourt who came to ask permission to marry one Emma Blenheim, his dormitory laundress. To the dean the marriage seemed ill-advised, for Walter was only 18 years old and Emma was 91. Walter agreed with the dean, but said he felt obligated to go through with it because Emma had invested her life savings in a transparent rainhood to protect her from the mist at Niagara Falls, where they planned to spend their honeymoon. If Walter called off the wedding, what use would the poor woman possibly have for a rainhood in Yutah? The wise, kindly dean pondered briefly and came up with a brilliant answer: let Walter punch holes in the back of Emma’s steam iron. With steam billowing back at the old lady, she would find a rainhood very useful—possibly even essential. Whimpering with gratitude, Walter kissed the dean’s Phi Beta Kappa key and hastened away to follow his advice—and the results, I am pleased to report, were madly successful! Today Emma is a happy woman—singing lustily, wearing her rainhood, eating soft-center chocolates, and ironing clothes—twice as happy, to be candid, than if she had married Walter ... And what of Walter? He is happy too. Freed from his unwanted liaison with Emma, he married a girl much nearer his own age—Agnes Yucca, 72. Walter is now the proud father—stepfather, to be perfectly accurate—of three fine, healthy boys from Agnes’s first marriage—Everett, 38; Wilhelm, 43; and Irving, 55—and when Walter puts the boys on a lead and takes them for a stroll in the park on Sunday afternoon, you may be sure there is not a dry eye in Yutah. And Dean Sigafoos? He too is happy—happy to spend long, tiring hours in his little office, giving counsel without stint and without complaint, doing his bit to set the young, uncertain feet of his charges on the path to a brighter tomorrow. @ 1963 Max Shulman We don’t say Marlboro is the dean of filter cigarettes, but we're sure it's at the head of the class. Get some soon—wherever cigarettes are sold in all fifty states of the Union.
