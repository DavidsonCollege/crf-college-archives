**Model III Constitution Nears Finalization**

By MICHAEL TANNER
Editor-in-Chief

The Trustee Governance Committee is nearing completion of its deliberations on the restructuring of the college’s governance system. They began
in November 1971. At their meeting on Jan. 31, the committee decided that Model III as amended is a good
college constitution. They hope to complete their final draft within a month and then submit it to the faculty and
students for their consideration. If the faculty and students have no major objections and express their approval of the document,
it will be placed on the trustee agenda in the spring.

During the January meeting, the governance committee, composed of students, faculty, administrators, and trustees, resolved several thorny issues that had
held back the committee’s progress. One such problem involved the function of a representative for the faculty. The committee finally
decided to give this individual the title ‘Vice Chairman of the Faculty Pro Tem’. His functions would include: 1) serving
as a representative of the faculty at trustee meetings; 2) serving as a representative of the faculty with the administration;
3) serving a coordinating function in the Faculty Executive Committee; 4) chairing faculty meetings in the absence of the president
and the academic vice president or at such other times as the president should designate.

A second issue involved the formulation and implementation of admissions policies. A committee, consisting of six faculty and two students,
was established which would advise the president on general policy. However, it was decided that the actual academic qualifications for
admissions would be set by the faculty. The committee decided against students reading admissions folders because of the time involved
and the issue of confidentiality.

The governance committee has thus completed its line-by-line evaluation of Model III and has made the changes it felt were
necessary. At this point, two parts of the document are incomplete. One section involves academic freedom, and faculty employment and
evaluation, which are currently being considered by the faculty and the trustees. The governance committee expressed the hope that these
constituencies would come to an agreement on these issues as soon as possible so that this section can be completed.
The second incomplete part is an amendment procedure, which a member of the committee is already drafting.

Unless any other major disagreement should arise, the committee will complete the draft by correspondence and will not meet again
until the faculty and students have considered the document. Governance Committee Chairman Walter L. Lingle is already making plans to
come to campus in March to introduce Model III to the faculty and students.

Model III is essentially a combination of two earlier models: the first a campus assembly and the second a bicameral
system. Model III defines the various constituencies of the college.

**Beer License Feasibility Undetermined**

By CHARLIE SHEPHERD
Managing Editor

"The Union can’t give beer away, much less sell it," commented Assistant Director of theUnion Duff Bruce was referring to
the recent ABC ruling which prohibits Davidson College Union from serving beer to students during Union activities. Last Friday, Bruce,
Director of the Union C. Shaw Smith, sophomore Rick Roylance, and junior Jud Cuttino made a trip to Charlotte to
discuss the matter with John Brooks, Supervisor for district five of the North Carolina Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) Board.

### Vote Postponed

In its meeting on Monday, Feb. 4, the Educational Policy Committee discussed and postponed a proposal regarding grades. This proposal
would allow the deletion of a failing grade from a student's Grade Point Average once the course is repeated, including
in the average only the grade of the repeated course. The money used to buy the beer came from student
fees. The fact that the Union had been giving the beer away during activities did not alter the situation in
the eyes of the law.

Bruce said that the ABC is anxious for the Davidson Union to get a beer license. He added that ABC
officials will check the College periodically if they get a license, as they do all establishments with licenses. “In that
way, we have the police on our side,” Bruce concluded. However, the Union is not anxious to do anything about
a license until they move into Grey Library, which will be renovated sometime next fall. Also, the trustees must agree
to acquiring a license because they have to sign for it and must ultimately take responsibility with the ABC board.

“What our policy will have to be until we see the trustees is that no beer will be supplied by
the Union,” conceded Bruce. He added that the Union will continue to check beer consumption during Union activities, which would
probably diminish. If beer is available, students are not likely to bring their own beverages. According to Bruce, it is
of the utmost importance to note that a license would not necessarily put the Union in the beer business. “What
we have to do is to convince the Board of Trustees and the alumni that we're not trying to get
into the beer business,” he added.

“Getting into the beer business” means that beer cannot be used as an incentive to attract students to Union activities.
For example, if a folksinger is performing in the Union bar, students should be encouraged to come for the entertainment
and not for the beer being served. As an alternative solution, the Trustees may ask ARA to obtain a license
to sell beer instead of the Union. However, ARA would sell the product at a higher price than the Union
because the Union will not have to make any profit on the beer.

### Construction Delayed

There has been so much rain during the fall and winter that several aspects of construction were stalled. Nor could
the workers make up lost time because of the labor issues. (See DELAY, page 3)
