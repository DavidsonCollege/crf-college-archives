Symmetry Restored

The earth there is weak now.

A tree like that one,

With such long irregular roots

Could not be held.

It should not have stood so long.

Look, think:

With some force that tree

was lifted

And laid,

Somehow gently, roots intact;

Soft earth spread

As if it had given it up willingly,

Released of a burden.

It means nothing.

It means nothing.

Take it away quickly.

It blocks the neat brick path.

It offends one’s sense of

symmetry.

It causes too much confusion.

The workmen come.

Finely honed blades hover.

The bark is no match for their bite.

Neat sections, clean measured cuts

Are removed in stages

Loaded into stacks on a well-tuned truck.

The truck drones, gears in perfect ratio,

Over the neat brick path.
