**Students Make Plans For Jr. Year Abroad**

Twenty-seven Davidson sophomores are making final preparations for their departure to France and Germany under the auspices of the Davidson
Junior Year Abroad Program. The students are currently completing their passport and visa forms, as well as having the various
shots necessary for foreign travel. During the past few weeks, the students have been meeting in a group to prepare
themselves for the questions and issues which will face them in Europe. Professors N. M. Johnson, P. B. Secor, and
A. S. Abbott have discussed the current issues of debate concerning America that are popular in Europe: the areas of
conservatism, foreign policy, the nature of the American government, and the history and outstanding proponents of American literature. Herb Jackson,
one of the students going to Marburg, gave an introduction to the developments of modern art in America.

The students planning to go to France are Cotten Alston, Bill Doggett, Tom Frist, Frank Goldsmith, Bruce Gregory, Bill Jones,
Don Leslie, Buford Norman, Ed Pate, and Cecil Wooten. Going to Germany are Dick Barney, Karl Beck, Hal Dial, Herb
Jackson, Ned Kelly, Tucker Laxton, Jim May, George Ward, and others.

**Glusman’s Feature Wins Press Prize**

Ted Glusman, DAVIDSONIAN feature writer, won a first place award in the recent College Press Awards competition in North and
South Carolina. Glusman’s feature story on Mark Van Doren, the year’s first Reynolds Lecturer, topped nearly 100 entries in the
features category from 26 college newspapers. THE DAVIDSONIAN received honorable mention in the Best College Newspaper category, sharing the award
with campus newspapers from Wake Forest, University of South Carolina, and Wofford. The Daily Tar Heel, University of North Carolina’s
publication, won first place in this category. Charles Dibble, 1964-65 editor-in-chief of THE DAVIDSONIAN, received honorable mention in the Editorial
division. More than 300 entries were submitted according to The Charlotte Observer and The Charlotte News, which sponsored the awards
for the third year.

**Social Council Plans Buffets, Combo Parties**

Campus Social Council, proposed by the recent faculty fraternity ruling, is presently planning next fall’s social functions. The goal of
this organization is to provide a new concept of social unity on campus and to meet the needs of fraternity
men, Independents, and incoming freshmen, according to Chairman Dan Campbell. The council will probably be elected by the student body
in the future, but next year’s council was appointed. Its members in addition to Campbell are Rocky Walker, vice-chairman; Irvine
Welling, treasurer; Mike Booe, corresponding secretary; Pinckney Whitson, recording secretary; and Joe Davis, Vince Foster, Jim Terry, Bill Kendrick, Tom
Scott, John Fagg, B. A. Aiken, Bill Aitken, and David Jennings. Two incoming freshmen will be appointed next fall. Seven
of these members were selected by the IFC: Campbell, Welling, and others.

In an effort to create a better and more organized campus social atmosphere next fall, the council plans to have
buffets at the Union following all home football games, according to Campbell. The buffets will be followed by combo parties
in Chambers Building, the Union, or outdoors. There will also be the two concert weekends and Homecoming Weekend during the
first semester, plus two concert weekends and two dance weekends during the second semester. Five combos, the Medallions, Enchanters, Monzas,
Embers, and the Fabulous Five, have been booked for a total of eight appearances in the first semester. Next year's
social fee will be used by the council to finance the standard functions, Campbell said, and it is hoped that
the remainder of the social fund can be used by the council to implement new programs, promote more realistic and
closer student-faculty social relations, enhance existing activities, and coordinate with the College Union. Campbell said of the Social Council, “It’s
all new, just formulated. Both student support and student suggestions will be the key to its success. Everyone involved in
it is enthused and convinced that it will bring a first-rate social atmosphere to the Davidson campus.”

**STADIUM SLATED FOR RENOVATION (See Page Four)**

**NUMBER TWENTY-NINE**

**New Amendment**

A referendum will be conducted Tuesday on an amendment to make the penalty more flexible for violators of the student
body drinking rule. At its regular meeting this week, the Student Council endorsed the petition which brought about the referendum.
The petition, signed by approximately 130 students, calls for a change in Article 8, Section 2 of the Student Body
Constitution to read, “Every student found guilty of violation of this regulation shall be punished in accordance with the seriousness
of the offense, with the maximum penalty being suspension from the college.”

**Council Appoints Independents To Social Council Positions**

By FRANK FLEMING
Davidsonian Staff Writer

Student Council has elected three students to represent the Independents on the newly-organized Social Council. Bill Aitken, B. A. Aiken,
and David Jennings will represent the rising senior, junior, and sophomore classes, respectively. Although John Fagg, Lee Fanning, Billy Clark,
and David Walker were absent from the Tuesday meeting, President Bill Council proceeded to appoint the following members to serve
on various standing committees: David Meschan, Randy McKnight, Financial; Chuck Matthews, Magazine Advisory Board; John Thomas, Academic Scheduling; Jim Timmons,
Student Activities; and Paul Marion, Non-academic Scheduling. Council concluded by confirming Thomas’ earlier appointment to the Traffic Committee.

In major business, the council received a petition to make onanism an offense under the student body regulations. Council read
aloud the petition before the council members and several visitors. Since the council declined to discuss this document, the visitors
(three of the 56 who had signed it) soon left.

**Rush Regulations Feature Open Parties**

The Interfraternity Council met Monday night to expand and clarify the recent ruling by the Trustees on the fraternity situation.
Rules governing rush for next year were approved, stated IFC President Jim Terry. According to the new rules, no rush
letters or parties will be permitted during the summer. There will be no formal rush until Oct. 30, when there
will be open parties at all fraternity houses. All members of the student body will be invited to come to
these afternoon parties and will be encouraged to visit as many houses as each wishes. There will be two similar
parties on Nov. 6 and Nov. 13. Invitations will be sent out to the remaining two parties on Dec. 4
and 11. Those receiving invitations will be permitted to visit three houses on each of these afternoons. Bids will be
mailed during the first three days of the Christmas holidays and must be returned before school resumes. Rushees failing to
confirm their bids will not be allowed to pledge any fraternity until the end of February. Formal pledging will take
place during the first week of the second semester. Contact between fraternity members and freshmen is prohibited after 7:30 p.m.
in dorms, fraternity houses, and off-campus. Also, there will be no contact after these rush parties until the end of
February.Following Monday morning, Greek Week will be held from March 24 until April 6. However, no date will be set
for initiation; each fraternity may set its own date. IFC dues will be $7 for fraternity members and $3 for
pledges. The IFC also voted to accept representatives from eating clubs petitioning for membership. Rules applying to fraternities will also
apply to eating clubs. Any rushee who commits himself to a boarding house must keep this commitment until the end
of the year. However, at the end of the meeting, Bob Bryan reopened the subject by calling the petition “an
effort to make hock out of student government processes.” Will Jackson labeled it a “crude joke on the constitution.” David
Powell advised, “There's no sense in taking it seriously. They're just trying to set the council up as a bunch
of stuffed shirts.” Council explained that the onanism petition would be read along with the Powell petition in chapel Thursday;
both petitions will then be voted on in next Tuesday's referendum.

Before the meeting officially convened, council members saw a 15-minute film on the Moral Re-Armament movement. Malcolm Roberts, a '58
graduate of Princeton, explained the purposes and history of his organization and encouraged student attendance at the Moral Re-Armament ‘Mackinac
Demonstration’ this summer. This assembly in Mackinac Island, Mich., will include youth from Africa, Asia, and Europe—all dedicated to ‘ending
dictatorship, moral pacifism, and social violence.’ In answering student questions, Roberts called the movement “revolutionary, yet not anti-Communistic.” Since the
cost of attending one of the 3-week sessions is $200, the council discussed the possibility of financing a delegate. After
Ben Cannon reported a balance of almost $200, Fred Sackett suggested, “Since we have a regional National Student Association officer
(Arnie Goodstein), we ought to use this excess money to send him to the nation-wide NSA convention.” The consensus of
the council seemed in accord with Sackett, but no action was taken.

Before adjourning, Council appointed Meschan as a committee-of-one to investigate recent complaints about laundry irregularities. As a final measure, council
unanimously approved Powell's motion of appreciation to its three senior advisors, Jackson, Sackett, and Walker. The representative who presented the
petition told the council, “I don’t think this rule (drinking rule) should be held over our heads.” He said he
wanted the rule to be changed as soon as possible and called on the council “to devote attention now to
something we can carry out this year.” Will Jackson said he believed it would be better to postpone the referendum
until next fall. He emphasized the importance of the Student Council poll on drinking. “We must find out,” he commented,
“what the group we're representing wants.” “I don't think the petition should be presented right now,” he continued. “Next fall
there will be a better chance of accomplishing what you want.” Fred Sackett agreed with Jackson, but Joe Davis, Honor
Court member who attended the meeting, said, “If the council doesn't allow the petition to go before the students, then
it's making a mistake.” The problem of confusion of the referendum and polls and the question of whether or not
the referendum will be the final action in the drinking controversy was discussed at some length. Balloting will be conducted
on Tuesday, which is the pre-exam reading day, in the lobby of Chambers from 9 a.m.-12 noon and 1:30-4:30 p.m.

BULLETIN
Quips and Cranks Editor Zack Long announced this afternoon that the 1965 annuals will be distributed to seniors beginning at
1 p.m. Saturday, May 29. Other classes can secure their yearbooks later that afternoon. Long’s closely-guarded secret was greeted with
surprise that his books will be available before graduation. He declined to reveal any details about the new annual.

BUILDING MAY START SOON
Plans Begun For Clubs
By JOHN BAILEY
Davidsonian Staff Writer

A strong nucleus of Independents and fraternity men met during chapel period Wednesday to discuss and ask questions dealing with
the development of the proposed eating clubs. The meeting was presided over by Joe Obenshain, temporary chairman of the student
group that has been meeting with the Faculty Committee on Fraternities, Clubs, and Social Life. The three students working with
Obenshain are George Brown, Jesse Sims, and Bruce Hyslop.

ESTIMATED COSTS
Obenshain discussed the estimated costs to members of an eating club. Included in the fees would be board, housing fee,
social assessment, and probably a small additional charge to begin payment on furnishings which, it is hoped, would be initially
taken care of by the college and paid off over a period of years by the club’s membership. It was
pointed out by Obenshain that all fees would be comparable to those of fraternities and that the total cost for
an academic year would be around $500. It was noted that this was a very rough estimate.

SERIOUS THINKING
Obenshain stated that he was “very pleased with the turnout at the meeting,” and he said that “the important thing
was that it set people to serious thinking about the situation.” Dr. W. G. McGavock, chairman of the Faculty Committee
on Fraternities, Clubs, and Social Life, was present at the meeting as were Dean of Students R. C. Burts and
Professor George Labban, two other members of the committee. McGavock stated that he thought “the response in the meeting was
very positive and it shows that interest is pretty high.” The problem of whether to build one or two houses
was discussed and McGavock said he didn't think “that there is any question that two houses would be more effective
than one.”

DEFINITE COMMITMENT
He indicated that a letter asking for a definite commitment on the interested students’ part would be distributed by the
middle of next week. This letter will be the determining factor in whether one or two clubs are built. R.
A. Currie, business manager of the college, said that he was “hopeful that two houses can be finished by October
1.” He stated that President D. G. Martin is forming a committee to study where the houses should be placed
(probably around the perimeter of Patterson Fraternity Court), and also to determine necessary architectural alterations in the new houses.

CULTURE, EXISTENTIALISM
'Herberg Covers Range
By TED GLUSMAN
Davidsonian Feature Writer

He looked like Sebastian Cabot. But the instant he uttered a word, with his forceful voice and definite Jewish accent,
that possibility was dispelled. Instead, he was Will Herberg, this year’s last Reynolds lecturer, with a doctorate in something called
Social Philosophy and the title Professor of Culture from Drew University in New Jersey. “They invented that title,” he quipped,
“because it includes everything.” During his two days at Davidson, he exhibited one part anthropologist, three parts philosopher, and two
parts theologian.

Known as author of Protestant, Catholic, Jew, Herberg was in for sociological questioning during his first few minutes on campus
by a group of interested students. Among his many comments was that the South is the only true section of
the country with an identity as a section. “The South has to exclude Texas,” he added, “which was never the
South, and southern Florida, which is just a suburb of New York!” He proceeded to politics, blasting many civil rights
enthusiasts because “they take something that is relative and make it absolute. They put their ultimate allegiance in something political.”
When asked about Robert Kennedy, a close friend of his, he described Kennedy as “bright, ruthless, and ambitious.” Herberg continued,
“Without John, he will fall into the trap of too great an ambition.”

Monday night, Herberg spoke in Hodson Hall on “Existentialism: Atheistic and Religious.” He divided existentialism into three parts: a way
of thinking about human existence, an analysis of the human situation, and an answer to the human predicament. He divided
thinking into the two categories of “objective” and “existentialist,” which he defined as “the thinking of the existing subject about
his existence, as he exists his existence.” The religious existentialist feels that “the human being, in his transcending, meets transcended
reality: God.” The atheist, on the other hand, feels that in this transcending, man “meets Nothing. Not meets not anything,
but meets Nothing.” Both arrive at this conclusion by an act of faith, asserted Herberg.

Herberg closed with three major drawbacks of existentialism: it is “incurably individualistic, unstable, and radically man-centered.” Tuesday in chapel, Herberg
spoke on “The Strangeness of Faith.” He discussed the position that the “anti-believer” is closer to God because “he takes
God seriously,” than is the “lukewarm, conventionally pious man.” To the latter, stated Herberg, God is a “great cosmic public
utility.” Both the firm believer and the firm unbeliever, stated Herberg, are involved with a “passion of infinite concern.”
