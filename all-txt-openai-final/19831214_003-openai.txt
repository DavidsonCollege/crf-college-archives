### Julie Abrams Studies Eating Disorders And Taste
By ALLISON WILLS

Senior psychology major Julie Abrams is studying the correlation between eating disorders and taste as part of research for her honors thesis. Under the supervision of two Davidson psychology professors, Abrams has been soliciting volunteers to participate in a taste test. The response has been poor, however.

“People are scared of this, but they shouldn’t be,” she explained. “It’s not associated with the Dean’s office or any sort of counseling, and we are making every effort to ensure the anonymity of the participants.”

Psychology professors James Walker and Cole Barton have different realms of expertise to bring to the experiment. Walker specializes in taste and olfaction, and Barton is interested primarily in family therapy, which has proven the most effective means of curing eating problems.

“I took a class in sensation and perception last year and became very interested in taste perception,” Abrams said. “Dr. Walker and I began talking about the physiological aspects of taste, and then we considered how this affected eating problems, which got Dr. Barton interested in the project.”

“Our goal is to try to approach it with an open mind,” Barton said. “We've read the latest psychological and medical literature about taste as related to eating problems, and there is no clear picture.”

Barton stressed that subjectivity is a major problem in psychological studies, “especially in adolescent psychology because it is difficult to determine the abnormal from the normal.” Often these determinations are based on “the judgment of parents, medical opinion or what looks good as determined by culture,” he said.

In this project, they hope to overcome all prejudices to arrive at a clear, objective study of the relationship of taste to problem eating. “We are interested in any circumstance in which somebody feels they do not have the control over eating that they would like to have,” Barton said.

Though Barton declined to be explicit about the taste tests in order to avoid skewing the results, he did say that a possible test might examine the degree to which participants taste sweets and salts or how sensitive they are to slight differences in sweetness or saltiness. Another important issue over which there has been some discussion is whether quality or quantity is more desirable to human taste buds.

Barton believes that Davidson will be an interesting place to study the problem because “in college, students are responsible for making their own decisions about eating, sometimes for the first time in their lives” and “possibly the problem is more common at Davidson due to the kind of students here.”

Barton described the typical victim of an eating disorder as a young woman who makes too many demands on herself and is never satisfied with her performance.

The tests will not take more than an hour and twenty minutes of the participant’s time, and more volunteers are desperately needed. Participants’ identity will be known only to the people in the study, and a research report will be available to those who complete the study. Interested students should contact Julie Abrams at 892-4451 or leave your name, P.O. Box number, and phone number in a mail slot marked “Taste Project” in Room 105, Chambers.

### India Group: Program Offers Long-Term Value
By ELIZABETH WHITE and ANN MEADOR

When deciding to take a term away from Davidson, some students think about an internship in a large city such as New York or Washington, others wonder about taking a term at a different school, and many consider going abroad to study in Europe.All hope to spice up their college years with a real, different experience. One group of Davidson students took the idea of “broadening your horizons” to an extreme; they spent three months living and studying in India. Jenny Barnhardt, Elizabeth Elkin, Beth Geiger, Kurt Henjes, Dan Plaut, and James Rozelle represented Davidson in a program sponsored by the South Atlantic States Association of Asian and African Studies (SASAAS). The program was started four years ago with a group going every two years, so this group was the third one to participate. The 13 also included students from UNCC, Appalachian State, Guilford, and Skidmore. Their advisor was Dr. David White, a history professor at Appalachian.

The students lived in the Hotel Kanchi in Madras, India, and studied in a special program at the University of Madras. The last three weeks of their trip they traveled as a group all over India, briefly visiting major cities and tourist attractions.

Why India? Students had various reasons. Junior Elizabeth Elkin wanted to study a less-developed country and to experience something radically different from Davidson. Senior Beth Geiger, a religion major, says she became fascinated with Buddhism and the “completely different mindset of Easterners” and felt the only way she could completely understand it was to experience the Indian culture. James Rozelle was eager to experience a totally different environment, somewhere out of the western world.

The students all said adjustment to such a different way of life was gradual; one even described it as “horrifying at first.” The heat (often above 100 degrees), the crowds (Madras has a population of 4 to 5 million), and the Indian food were among the first difficult obstacles.

Requirements for the Program

Director of South Asian Studies I. Job Thomas, who oversees the selection of Davidson participants in the India program, said the program was begun as a non-Western alternative to the other study-abroad programs Davidson offers. “Adapting to a culture is a skill one acquires,” he said, and he views the program as an excellent opportunity for Davidson students to develop this skill. The academic program is rigorous, according to Thomas, and students are required to write a research paper based on fieldwork done in Madras. “There is no chance to get out of practice,” Thomas said of the workload.

Offered every other year, the program is designed for juniors and seniors, but occasionally a sophomore will be accepted. Recommendations as well as grade point averages and number of courses taken on India are required for the application. Regular Davidson tuition and federal aid cover the program’s expenses.

Long-term Value

“When travel in India influences a person, it influences him for life,” Thomas said. “It’s not like a Christmas cruise to the Caribbean.” Senior Tom Pafford traveled to India in 1981 as part of the India program, and he echoes Thomas’s belief. “India made me appreciate understanding, because I couldn’t be an Indian,” he said. “All I could do is understand what Indians are like.” Spending a term in India ultimately led to confusion for Pafford, for “after I got back, I considered the reasons for my travel more than before I left,” he said. “You find ways to relate your travel to other things you do, even if it’s just going to the Par-4.”
