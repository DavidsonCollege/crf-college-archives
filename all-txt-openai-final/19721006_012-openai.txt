Gym Hours Remain Same, Bevan Says Money Available
By HUGH HENNIS / Staff Writer

Athletic Director Tom Scott said this week that the current gym hours will not be extended unless the Physical Education Department receives more money to hire additional staff members. “I would like to see the gym open longer on Saturdays, but unless we are given the proper staff to do this, such an idea is both impossible and unfeasible,” Scott said. “As to extending weekday hours, there is no need in such an activity. The student has plenty of time to utilize the facilities during the day, and keeping the gym open even later at night would not be worth paying the electric bill.”

The gym is currently open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday through Friday; from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. Saturdays, and from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. on Sundays. During important athletic events, the gym is locked to all extracurricular activities.

“It’s absurd,” responded SGA President Ralph Peeples. “The issue of these gym hours is just another example of the bureaucracy in the offices of Davidson College. It seems such a shame that when the President and staff...

Tenure: ‘Christians Only’

challenge.” Bevan and other faculty also commented on the interpretation of the rule. How is ‘Active’ to be defined, and how is “church” to be defined? The Board of Trustees is the interpretive body, but Vice President Bevan is responsible for hiring faculty, and he reported difficulties with this rule. McKelway maintains that the rule “does not by itself guarantee the Christian character of the college. It tends to create a fortress mentality.” Chairman of the Board of Trustees Warner L. Hall defended the rule in a telephone...in- terview saying that the college since its inception has been Christian-oriented and that the only way to be so is to have a Christian faculty. Hall also said that if a college is to maintain a Christian stance, it will do so not by courses but by people who teach in the Christian stance. “Davidson College does not try to be all things to all men. It is trying to understand the world in the light of the Christian faith.”

In the middle of October, the exact date has not been confirmed yet, the Trustee Education Committee will meet with Patterson, who is president of the Davidson chapter of the American Association of University Professors, and other faculty to discuss principles of tenure, and the issues of religious restriction will probably be brought before that group. The Governance Committee is another group which will discuss this problem as it studies the Trustee by-laws in fulfilling its charge to develop a plan for governing the college.

The wording concerning religious restriction for tenure was altered after the Spencer Commission Report was received. The old rule required the Trustees “to satisfy themselves as to the Christian faith of every individual eligible to receive tenure.” It was changed to its present form, requiring active membership in a Christian church in order to make it a less subjective definition, according to Patterson.

are so interested in opening up new areas to the student, little details such as these are neglected,” he said. “Last year we were bounced around from the Director of Athletics to the coaches’ office to the Comptroller's office. This year we again are trying to bring about some productive results."

Vice President for Academic Affairs John M. Bevan said that students could request funds from the budgets of Buildings and Grounds, Physical Education, or Student Life. If money is not available in these areas, Bevan suggested that students petition College President Samuel R. Spencer Jr. for money from the college contingency fund. This fund covers areas not generally anticipated when the college budget was drawn up.

“The problem concerns one of two things--either there is a lack of relating funds, or there is found to be no need among the students. If the facilities are to be used, we ought to meet the needs of the students,” Bevan said.

Freshman Bill Reed felt that as the situation stands, the best and cheapest solution would be to have responsible volunteers who could assume the task of supervising gym activities as well as closing up at night. Another freshman said he felt the gym should be open longer on Saturday since this is the day the student has more leisure time.
