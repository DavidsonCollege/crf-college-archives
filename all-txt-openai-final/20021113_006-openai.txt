Look for Season Two to come out early in 2003.

**Skip: ER.** My freshman hall bonded by watching this medical drama together on Thursday nights. Despite my fond memories, I have to admit that last season was inexcusably terrible. The “Dr. Greene’s incurable brain cancer is miraculously cured and then comes back to kill him” story arc got less believable every time it came on the screen. The little I’ve seen of the new season hasn’t given me much hope for a restoration to its former glory.

**Recommended: Trading Spaces.** If you haven’t yet joined the TLC cult (which also includes fans of A Wedding Story and A Baby Story) this is the place to start. Two designers work with two sets of neighbors and one carpenter to redo one room in each house — in 48 hours, with $1000 as a budget. The results are sometimes tacky, sometimes gorgeous, and always fun to watch. Trading Spaces airs at 4 p.m. most weekdays, and on Saturdays at 9 p.m. on TLC (The Learning Channel, cable only).

**RELATIONSHIPS**
Lauren Stutts:

Simply put: Relationships are hard. They are stretched beyond capacity, are put on hold, and metamorphose constantly. It’s hard to adjust when relationships are cut or when new relationships are added. It’s like you are being constantly rattled back and forth between them, and you just want to find the right balance. We can’t live without them, though. We just have to try our best to hold on.to quality relationships and try to adapt when they change. I love the quote by the psychiatrist Carl Jung about relationships: “The meeting of two personalities is like the contact of two chemical substances: if there is any reaction, both are transformed.”

Jenn Greene: My esteemed fellow health advisors elected me to write about love, presumably because I exude vibes that reek of bliss. Lucky me... Love is an amazing thing, but how do you categorize it or make it understandable for someone else? I’m not sure I can; all I can tell you is how love has changed me. Last year, I was on the verge of dropping out of school indefinitely. Over Christmas break, my parents talked me into giving the new semester a few more weeks. Then, the most remarkable thing happened—Marc came back from Australia, brought me water from the Great Barrier Reef, and we have been together ever since. He has been my salvation and my rock, and with his help, I have persevered. Even now, as I look back to freshman year, I can see how much I’ve changed over the past year. At last, the pressure to impress has finally been alleviated. I can wake up in the morning with a mascara-induced raccoon mask, and even though I shriek when I see myself in the mirror, he sees beyond that. Ploys to get his attention (i.e., drunken displays of debauchery) aren’t necessary: covering my nose and batting my eyes will do it every time, guaranteed. Uncomfortable thongs and short short skirts that keep riding up when getting one’s groove on are a thing of the past. I am very happy (and super-cute) in my jeans and one of his t-shirts. On a more serious note, there is an unspoken level of comfort that comes with the sort of commitment and trust which I have come to know. When I speak, he listens, though he can finish my sentences before even I know how they’ll end. That is priceless. Through bickering and tears, laughter and thrills, there is something solid that always prevails. I can only presume that is love. And for those of you who worry that, by falling in love, you lose the giddiness that comes with first infatuations, I can reassure you that the goosebumps remain. Every time Marc goes onto the hockey ice, I crush on him all over again.

Felicia Browne: Lately it seems a lot of my relationships have been going down the tubes. Without getting into specifics, several people who I have put a lot of faith and trust into have betrayed me—my father, my brother, friends from back home, etc. But to be quite honest with you, I am too busy to care. Maybe I am being selfish, but I just don’t have time to sit back and analyze how and why things went wrong. If these individuals were to apologize, I would forgive them in a heartbeat, but I am not going to stop living my life because of the demise of these relationships. Besides, I know that no matter what happens, I will always have a core group of people who I can rely on, particularly my mother, and that’s all I really need.

Tune in to the Body and Soul radio show on Wednesday nights between 10:00-11:00 on WALT 1610 AM: This week’s topic is “Relationships.”
