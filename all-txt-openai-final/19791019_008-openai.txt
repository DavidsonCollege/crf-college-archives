Sting, two Englishmen and an American, make up this new wave rock group. Their music, according to Life magazine, “fuses
rock, Jamaican reggae cadences, and an occasional jazz flourish.”

The Police have met with great popularity. Their first release, “Roxanne,” became an immediate hit. A single off their second
album is now number one in the United Kingdom. The group will perform at 8:30 Friday night in Love Auditorium.
Tickets are $3.00 for students and $5.00 general admission, available at the Union desk. So send your parents home and
come.

Take part in Davidson tradition.

Join the crowd that enjoys the delicious pizza at Mooresville’s King of Pizza. The food maintains an excellent reputation for
being fresh, warm, and of excellent quality. Davidson students enjoy the relaxed atmosphere or the take-out order service.

Check out King of Pizza and see how much you enjoy it.
