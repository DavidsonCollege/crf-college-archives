Mr. Steele, '06, to Resume His Work in Greece

Mr. Roy Steele, ‘06, is now on his way back to Greece to resume his duties as manager of the Kabala branch of the Liggett-Myers Tobacco Company, which position he has held for several years. Mr. Steele has been spending the summer in Charlotte at home with his mother, Mrs. E. S. Steele, and his sister, Mrs. Armand de Rosset Myers. He sailed from New York on the 21st for Italy, an Italian boat being the only one going at this time. He will go through Italy to Greece.

Mr. Steele had a very uncomfortable experience during the war, being caught in Sofia, Bulgaria, and not allowed to leave the country, the experience being fraught with no little danger as well as discomfort. It will be several years before Mr. Steele will be able to return to America. His many friends here are hoping that he will, on his next trip, remain permanently.

Lex Klutz in Poland With Relief Expedition

Those remembering the Klutz brothers who starred in baseball and football here a few years ago will be interested to know that Lex Klutz is in Poland with a relief expedition. He went to France two years ago with a medical unit and was attached to the Eighth Regiment, Infantry. After the armistice, his regiment went to Lissa, Germany, where it is now the only remaining element of the Army of Occupation. Klutz has been sent to Warsaw with the American-Polish Typhus Relief Expedition. He was associated with Dr. Lingle in C.E. and “Y” work, in which he was very active. His address will still be Eighth Infantry, Coblenz.

PHI. SOCIETY MEMBERS MAKE MERRY AT FEED
(Continued from Page 1.)

same as it has in former days. Billy Sunday, W. J. Bryan, and Woodrow Wilson were mentioned as good exponents of present-day oratory. The fact was also recalled that the last-named gentleman got his start in one of the Davidson societies. Another advantage of the societies, as brought out by Professor Currie, was that it taught parliamentary law and how to conduct any public meeting.

Following Professor Currie’s address, the feed proper took place. An effort was made to keep a record and see who had the most insatiable appetite. The scorekeepers, not having an adding machine, lost count, but the general opinion was that the honors should be equally divided between Spence and Worth. It is rumored that these two gentlemen forewent their regular evening repast in anticipation of the event.

After the eats, short talks were made by Askew, Sullivan, and McGirt, officers of the Eumenean Society. At the call of President Chalmers, all the Phi members pledged renewed allegiance to the society and promised to work harder in the future. The following men made known their intention of joining the society at the next regular meeting: C. W. Lewis, G. D. Farmer, L. F. White, F. S. Johnston, J. R. Jones, J. B. McCallum, H. S. Northrop, B. C. Thompson, and M. J. Murry. After a yell for the Eu’s and then one for the Phi’s, the festivities came to an end.

All-year-round soft drink

Fellowship—in college or out of it—flourishes best with good food and wholesome drink. Ice-cold Bevo—unexcelled among beverages in purity and healthfulness—is most satisfying as a drink by itself or a relish with food that makes a happier repast.
