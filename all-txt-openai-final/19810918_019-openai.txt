**J-Boy surveys fall prospects**

by J-boy

Beyond the practice fields, beyond the X’s and O’s on blackboards (or greenboards, as the case may be), beyond helmets
and pads, there is only one true fall sport at Davidson—not football, not soccer, not field hockey. It doesn’t show
up on the athletic budget, and the NCAA doesn’t keep statistics for it. Just girlwatching. Particularly freshman girlwatching.

Each fall about 150 rookie prospects arrive on campus from the extensive high school farm system. Upperclassmen and freshmen scouts,
aided by the Wildcat Handbook (the playbook of the sport), begin the screening process. The playbook, however, gives only a
limited amount of information—the name, hometown, and a not-so-accurate mug shot. The playbook is sadly lacking in two particular areas—height
and weight. To overcome this, scouts rely on the on-the-field tryout.

At this point, the freshmen are left on the bench. Leave it to the upperclassmen to know the first-class spots
for scoping.

Football players in particular are well trained in the on-field tryout. One cosmopolitan gridder checks out his rookie prospects everywhere.
“I look for a girl who respects her body and takes good care of it. She shows the way she
feels.”

Another gridder contends that a prime tryout spot is “sunbathing in the ROTC drill field in front of Rich.” He
was quite selective for his starters, adding, “They can’t be overweight. You know, they gotta be more body than brawn.
I also look for ones that don’t wear fluorescent clothing.”

The final football player interviewed scopes his big-league prospects “at dinner in the Commons.” He continued, “She must have legs,
yes, I look for the brick house—36-24-36.”

Soccer players, who expect training camp excellence as well, are not to be outdone. One studious booter does his girlwatching
“in the library, under the stairs. I look for them wandering around girls seeking attention.”

A less studious player conducts his tryouts at parties. “I’m not real choosy. I look for the blondes and the
ones having a good time,” he added.

One basketball player, on the other hand, was quite a bit more choosy. Where does he hold training camp? “Nowhere
on this campus.”

With tryouts over, statistics must be arranged in some coherent way. Scouts leaf through their notes, reviewing the rookies who
caught their eye in some way or another.

The rookies having been rated, the top-statistic girls are negotiated with concerning a contract. Parties are the frequent scene of
contact negotiations. Although scouts tend to broadcast contract signings far and near, many (and much less publicized) are the rejections
to contract offers. Top prospects who know their worth want to play for contenders, guys who have seen first place
before. Once the elusive contract is signed, scouting stops, and the girl is considered secure—for now. A trade or free
agency is always possible.

No one can deny that girlwatching is a prominent (though well-hidden) campus sport. For those enlightened ones among you who
wish to catch all the action either as spectator or participant, this weekend’s parties should prove quite an arena!

**Players of the Week**

The Davidsonian Sports section is announcing an addition to its revered pages. Each week, the sports editor will survey the
performances turned in by the various athletes involved in intercollegiate sports. The sports editor will choose the athlete(s) who have
exhibited the best performance of that week.

KEITH MARTIN and BRIAN WHITMIRE

Martin, a 19-year-old sophomore from Grey, Georgia, and Whitmire, a 21-year-old senior from Jacksonville, Florida, played integral roles in Saturday’s
come-from-behind football win over Wofford. Martin, starting his first game, ran for over 100 yards and threw two TD passes
in the 29-21 win. Whitmire, benched for Martin, patrolled the sidelines cheering for the team and was awarded the game
ball for his enthusiasm.
