When he left "Charlotte," Brother McAllister did it in two ways. John Coble accompanied him on the trip south. E.
B. Hunter accompanied "Siesta" Reid to the movie Saturday night. It reports that they had a "hugie" and didn't get
thrown out of the lobby of the theater. By the way, E. B. stood up Bill Lander this time in
order to go with "Siesta."

Bill Moore went to York and Rock Hill, Jack Barringer to Florence via Winthrop, Bill Robertson to Billy Rose (Concord,
that is). Thad Barringer and Claude Higginbotham gave Winthrop a thrill, and we hear that Claude received a small thrill
from a gorgeous creature at that great institution.

It looks as if Hoyo, the operator, takes first place in the past few days of wheeling. The Pensacola kid
faced with marital troubles hit the air lanes to thwart the opposition. The results will be brought out in a
forthcoming statement by the "great one" himself. Thatcher also breaks into print for his escapade north to Sweet Briar. The
"parrot" is rather mum about the subject. Anyway, congrats are in order to Thatcher for being elected president of Eu
Society—also to Ed Hopper on his election to the position of secretary of the above mentioned.

Marty Vitts has changed residences and now resides in the Queen City. Five nights in a row isn't half bad.
Sandy Wagram leads the way! Mr. Bridge Shaw will soon be brought before the Senate Investigation Committee for his recent
speculation in commodities. We are happy to announce that Wagram is recovering from his relapse owing to the recent drop
in the price of cotton. "Evolution" Thomasson is now forced to wear a hat, and "Beelzebub" Bradford is closing fast
on Satan and hopes to overtake him soon.

SIGMA CHI

First off, everyone is glad to welcome "Wistful Willie Wamerdam" Calhoun back to the fold after his prolonged seclusion in
the infirmary. Wistful Willie missed a lot, but we hear he also gained over 1,000 units of a very useful
drug! Well, Valentine's Day has come and gone, and still Tom Apperson and Bruce Jackson haven't heard a single word
from their midwinter dates! Tom even sent his date a Valentine!! Unconfirmed reports have it that the two rotators have
been raking in the mail!

"Kootsy" Fesperman has changed to Hollingsworth's brand of candy. Footsy is straining at the leash of 'ole Father Time to
get to Agnes Scott. Here's hoping Father Time doesn't interfere.

S.A.E.

Brothers and pledges of S.A.E. journeyed far and wide this past weekend after having been detained from their travels by
the recent bad weather. Alan Wilkes scored again, and this time it's with the very rebel coed who operated far
and wide. Before going any farther, the pledges would like to thank Bobby Carson for his tireless efforts in procuring
the El Morocco night club and Minute premises. All the time this was going on, an Abhbbhhl Ort was enlightening

The Pi Kapps would like to welcome the new brothers who were initiated last Thursday night. Walker Taylor was seen
at the Davidson-Citadel basketball game; however, he left at the end of the first half. Pledges Minzes, Sowerby, and Mitchell
took in Greensboro this past weekend. As a result of this trip, Minzes no longer has a car—he can make
a car do wonderful tricks. “Meatball” Bill Little and Russell spent the weekend playing basketball.

PHI DELTA THETA
Although absent from print these past few editions, due to the limited space of the paper, the brothers of Phi
Delta Theta have by no means been inactive on the social front. The little cogs and big wheels continue to
grind in the social whirl. Highlight of the midwinter weekend was the formal banquet held Saturday night at the Policeman's
Club. Brothers Hunter Boykin, Jim Murray, Newk Schenck, Fri Niblock, Bud Edwards, and Eckerd enjoyed the Mardi Gras Ball presented
by Queens College last Saturday night. McSwain was the guest of honor and the after-dinner speaker. Dr. C.K. Brown added
a new note to the evening by combining wit with an equally serious note. Brothers and pledges were well represented
at the College Church.

The chapter was happy to welcome back several alumni, including Sutton, O. I. Starnes, Buck Archer, and their dates. Last
week the chapter elected Willingham as the recipient of the Price Leadership Trophy for this year. This trophy is given
each year by Paul B. Price, Davidson '24, to that member of the Gamma chapter "who shall have been selected
as having contributed most to the development of the chapter and the promotion of the ideals of the fraternity." Willingham
was the recipient of this award last year.

Since the dance weekend, most of the brothers have been content to remain on campus for the basketball game and
rest up.

KAPPA ALPHA
Since the chief has given our column the knife for the last two weeks, we'll have to make up for
lost time. Of course, the biggest event in many moons was that great set of mid-winter dances with music by
Claude Thornhill & Co. Despite the relatively high humidity over the weekend, the knights were there en masse. Just to
liven up things a bit, the chapter threw a bit of entertainment at the College Church.
