**Stronger Penalties for DUI**

If you didn’t get a chance to see the Observer this week, you should. They’ve been taking a long look at drinking laws and drunk driving. They’ve done a very good job of outlining how the laws do and don’t work, the courts, the proposed changes of the laws, and the public’s attitude toward drinking. A lot of people have been talking about Dean of Students Will Terry’s Outbasket. The Dean’s paternalistic and patronizing tone made many people mad, as well it should have. But the insulting language doesn’t negate all the points he made about alcohol at Davidson. Eating popcorn and diagnosing cocktail parties in advertising may seem silly, but there are still quite a few bad attitudes toward drinking at Davidson.

It will take more than exhortations from the Dean to alter attitudes. Until people stop thinking that it is prestigious to drink huge amounts, no changes will be made. Until people realize that it isn’t macho to drive while drunk, people will die, maybe your friends. Until people tell other people that what they’re doing is dangerous and stupid, they won't change. So long as people think drinking to excess is attractive, it will go on, and people will be hurt, both physically and emotionally.

The North Carolina legislature is considering several bills to combat the drunk driver. The one that affects students the most would raise the drinking age to 21. Of course, we are against this. There is no need to go over again the arguments about “old enough to fight and vote, old enough to drink.” It also unjustly penalizes the majority of young adults who drink responsibly. Like it or not, alcohol is a part of college life. It will remain so whether it is legal or not.

We do, however, favor toughening the penalties for drunk driving. There is no excuse for driving after drinking. We don’t care if one drinks, even to excess occasionally. When a drunk gets behind the wheel, though, he’s out to kill us and himself. Drunk drivers should go to jail on the first offense. Subsequent arrests should mean loss of license, more jail, and big fines. It is not a simple mistake; it is potential murder.

We do not mean to lecture; the Dean can handle that. There is nothing wrong with drinking. There is little wrong with getting drunk. At times, for the right people at the right time, it is exactly the right thing to do. Davidson has far fewer problems with alcohol than most other schools. Davidson could probably stand a few more drinkers. However, the problems we do have cannot be ignored. We do not want to lose any classmates to a drunk driver, or future alumni to alcoholism.

**Unbelievable!**

**Mouthwash swabs! Breathless 80's!**

When I was in Cashion’s recently, a woman rushed up to me, gasping, “Ann, Ann! Come look! You have to see this! Hurry, hurry!” Her enthusiasm was boundless, and seeing as how I was tired of scanning The Enquirer, I followed her.

By the time we reached the Health & Beauty Aids section, my guide was breathless. “How much do you love the Health & Beauty Aids section?” she asked. A lot, I thought to myself, but I decided to play it cool.

“Oh, you know, pretty much, I guess.”

“Well, I love it and I think it has more Good Things per square foot than any other place in the world.” A statistician, I thought. Not bad. She swung her arms back and forth, hopping from foot to foot. She picked up shampoo bottles of all varieties, encouraging me to examine them myself. “Shampoo!” she screeched. “Conditioner!” Running to the far end of the aisle, she gathered toothpaste and dental floss. “Three colors in one tube! Unbelievable!” She opened a box and squeezed a healthy sample into her palm. She ate it.

“Aw look, no kidding. Mouthwash. Here—try some!” She took a swig. “Good thing, you know?”

After thirty seconds the woman had collected more than an armload of Health & Beauty aids (“Swabs! Cotton balls! Band-Aids! Stridex! Pursettes!”), and she began dropping things. Fortunately, she had attracted a sizeable coterie of young children who had snuck away from their parents; these children picked up the products and handed them each to the woman. “Hey lady, here’s your lotion.”

“Thanks, oh thanks! Gosh, there’s just so much! Everybody, have some. They’re fun! Hair spray, even!”

At this point I realized the woman was serious. “Do you mean to say that you really enjoy these products?”

“Oh yes, of course. Look at this soap—it’s just like Jell-O.”

I excused myself and returned to the magazine rack. Mothers hastily retrieved their children. It has been a long week.
