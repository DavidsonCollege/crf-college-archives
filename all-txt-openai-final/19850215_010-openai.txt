**Cats Fall To UTC; Team Hit With Illnesses, Injuries**

By ANDY BARRON

Davidson’s men’s basketball team had a disappointing road trip to the state of Tennessee last weekend. The Cats lost to conference-leading UT-Chattanooga 69-58 on Saturday and then lost to East Tennessee State 68-67 in overtime on Monday. The losses dropped Davidson to 9-16 overall and 5-7 in the Southern Conference.

For the first time this season, injuries and illnesses weakened the Cats. Junior Ken Neibuhr, who has been nursing a sore thigh for several weeks, played less than usual in the game against UT-C. Freshmen Jeff Himes and Derek Rucker felt the effects of the flu against UT-C and did not have stellar efforts. Despite these obstacles, Davidson led the Mocs at halftime 27-26. Junior Pat Riazzi came off the bench to lead Davidson’s first-half effort with six points. The Cats shot a torrid 63 percent from the field in the first half. This hot shooting made up for UT-C’s tremendous advantage in shots taken and put the Cats on top.

The Mocs exploded out of the locker room and outscored Davidson 13-2 in the first four minutes of the second half. The Cats fought back, however, and spent the next 10 minutes of the game trimming UT-C’s lead from 10 to 52-48 with six minutes left. Yet this margin would be as close as Davidson would come to salvaging a win. UT-C hit free throw after free throw to seal its victory. Freshman Terry Rupp had nine points to lead Davidson’s scoring.

The Cats then traveled to ETSU hoping to regain their winning ways. The first half was a struggle as neither team was able to shake the other. The biggest lead was only four points (Davidson, 6-2), but occurred three minutes into the game.

**Women’s Basketball Drops Hard-Fought Games**

The Lady Cats just completed an arduous week, playing four games in six days. Over that span Davidson played a fast Warren Wilson team, an excellent Gardner-Webb team, and battled Methodist in what Coach Patty Daley called “a disorganized game.”

Warren Wilson took advantage of its quickness to lead the entire way. The Lady Cats never stopped fighting and pulled within 14 with eight minutes left. Suddenly Warren Wilson hit everything it shot and Davidson lost the game, 99-61. “They were a good group of shooters,” Daley said of Warren Wilson. “I thought we shot well until the end. Inconsistent shooting has hurt us all season. It was tough to get up and down the court with them. Still, I was pleased with our effort.”

Sophomore Heather McKee led the Cats with 22 points and 10 rebounds. Sophomore Mary Griffith demonstrated her long-range accuracy with 14 points, all at least from 15 feet. Sophomore Woodie Cornelson added 10 points.

Davidson went into the Gardner-Webb game knowing it was about to play one of the toughest teams on its schedule and that it had to play games the two following nights. To conserve energy for the next two games, Daley played everybody a lot. The goals were to decrease turnovers and to control tempo. The final score, Gardner-Webb winning 113-53, was...Not the major concern. “We cut our turnovers from the previous game in half,” said Daley. “I was very pleased with our effort in that area. The game was a team effort at improving the team and preparing for our next game. Keeping those goals in mind, I thought the game was a success.”

Wednesday night Davidson made up a game with Methodist College. This make-up game made life difficult for the Lady Cats. Still, it was a “winnable” game and Davidson came ready to play. Turnovers plagued the Lady Cats all night as did a conspicuous lack of refereeing talent. “The game was very rough,” Daley said. “I was very frustrated with the officiating. The rough nature of the game really rattled us. We should have spent more time setting up and looking for good shots.” Methodist won the game, 76-60.

McKee led Davidson with 22 points and 15 rebounds and got a lot of help from a lot of people. Griffith had nine points and four rebounds, junior Amy Hartman had six points, six rebounds and seven assists, and sophomore Wendy Warner added eight points. The Lady Cats pulled down 43 rebounds, a team high for the year.

Davidson's final home game is tomorrow afternoon against Greensboro College. The Lady Cats finish the season at Coker Monday night.

Monday’s game against East Tennessee State went into the game. Once again, no single player stuck out for Davidson as Himes and sophomore Chris Heineman led the team in scoring with six points each. Heineman made a fast break lay-up to give Davidson a 33-32 lead at halftime. East Tennessee took advantage of Davidson’s customary early-second-half lapse and captured the lead. ETSU never trailed in the second half after hitting its first shot and led by seven with eight minutes left. Fortunately for Davidson, ETSU committed a number of fouls, allowing the Cats to exhibit their fine free throw shooting ability. Davidson hit 12 of 14 free throws down the stretch to tie the score at 60 at the end of regulation.

The Cats took the lead for the first time since the half when Rucker hit a 15-foot jumper with 2:29 left in overtime. The teams exchanged the lead several times until junior Pepper Bego hit a long shot to put Davidson on top, 67-66 with 16 seconds remaining. Total chaos ensued as the Buccaneers attempted to get off their last shot. This strategy turned out to be brilliant as somehow, some way, ETSU forward Calvin Cannady was fouled by Niebuhr. Cannady made both ends of the one and one to give ETSU a 69-68 upset.

Rucker led Davidson with 16 points and was aided by Bego’s 13. Davidson now finds itself losing momentum as the post-season tournament approaches. The Cats travel to Marshall and The Citadel this weekend needing to win either (ideally, both) to rediscover how it feels to win a conference game. Only complete disaster and several twists of fate could prevent Davidson from making the Southern Conference tournament. However, if the Cats don’t start winning soon, their stay at the tournament will be a short one.
