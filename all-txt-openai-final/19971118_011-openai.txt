THE DAVIDSONIAN, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 18

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT MEN’S BASKETBALL GAMES

QUESTIONS ABOUT TICKETS

CAN I GET FREE TICKETS?

Yes. All students with an ID card are entitled to a free ticket to all games. Faculty and staff are allowed to pick up additional tickets for their spouse/guest. All seats are reserved. If you have a group that wishes to sit together, come as a group or send one member with several ID cards to pick up a block of tickets. Picking up tickets in advance is advantageous in that you won’t have to stand in the line at the arena.

WHEN CAN I GET TICKETS?

Student/faculty/staff tickets may be picked up as you enter Belk Arena or at the Ticket Office window from 8:30 AM to 5:00 PM on the day of the game. The Wake Forest game will be an exception to this rule and tickets may be picked up during working hours from Monday, December 1 through game day, December 3.

WHERE WILL MY SEATS BE LOCATED?

The first 300 students will receive Red Seat tickets running from section 8 behind the visitors' bench to section 3 (where the President sat last year). This L-shaped area flanks the Pep Band. After that, students will receive tickets in sections 104 and 102 above the Domino’s Pizza Stand. Faculty/Staff tickets are located in Section 106 on the bench side.

CAN I GET TICKETS TO AWAY GAMES?

Yes, except for Duke. Duke sells no individual game tickets. However, we generally can provide good tickets to any away games with advance notice. Tickets to the UNCC game at Halton Arena on the UNCC campus are free to students, faculty, and staff as long as our supply lasts. Generally, the prices for other games range from $7-$10 for Southern Conference games and probably $15-$20 for ACC/SEC/WAC or PAC-10 games.

QUESTIONS ABOUT PARKING

ARE THERE PARKING RESTRICTIONS FOR MEN’S BASKETBALL GAMES?

Yes, we must dedicate two of the three parking bays in the Baker Sports Complex Parking Lot but we are trying to limit the hours of restriction so as not to affect faculty members, physical plant staff, and students who use the lot but drive their cars away at a reasonable hour.

WHAT ARE THE RESTRICTED PARKING BAYS AND THE HOURS OF RESTRICTION?

The first two parking bays (closest to Baker) must be cleared 2½ hours before game time which means at 5:00 PM for most games. Please remove all cars without a Basketball Season Parking Pass from these two lots at that time. The third parking bay (the one closest to Concord Road) will never be restricted and is the best place to park for students who leave their car at Baker for extended periods. Parking restrictions end after the game.

WHAT ABOUT THE HANDICAP PARKING SPACES IN THE FIRST BAY?

Handicap spaces are never restricted for those with handicap license plates.

HOW ARE WE GOING TO REMEMBER THE DATES WHEN THERE IS RESTRICTED PARKING?

We will provide two reminders: First, the list of restricted days and hours is published to the right. Second, there will be warning signs up the day before and the day of each game at the entrances of the first two parking bays of the Baker Sports Complex.
