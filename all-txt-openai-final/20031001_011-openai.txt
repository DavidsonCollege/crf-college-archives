#### Field hockey extends streak to 6
#### Dayton poses stiff challenge

By Ben WHIGHAM, Staff Writer

This weekend’s victories over Catawba and Radford pushed field hockey’s winning streak to six games, their longest in ten years. Now 3-0 against conference opponents, Davidson holds the top spot in the Norpac conference’s eastern division and is looking stronger than ever.

Entering last week, Davidson’s unbeaten streak appeared to be in jeopardy due to two away games on grass fields. The Cats, who practice and compete on Astroturf, had no experience with the slower playing surface. "You have to lift the ball to get it downfield," explains head coach Lisa Thompson. "It’s a totally different game." Nonetheless, the ’Cats made the proper adjustments and were able to pull out wins in both contests.

The first game, against Catawba, turned into an 89-minute test of endurance for Davidson. Despite competing against one of the weaker opponents on their schedule, Davidson’s inexperience with the grass field slowed their production significantly. In addition, an impressive performance by the Catawba keeper negated Davidson’s 36-10 shot advantage. The scoreboard remained dormant well into the second overtime when midfielder Liz Schoening ’05 rifled in the game-winning score, sealing the match for the visiting ’Cats.

Despite the underwhelming victory over Catawba, the experience with a grass field proved invaluable to the ’Cats. Their next game, an away match against conference opponent Radford, was also decided on a natural playing surface. Jumping up 1-0 after a score by Emily Davis ’06, Davidson looked strong against a physical Radford squad. Radford would take advantage of a penalty corner in the second half, however, sending the game into extra periods. "There was a questionable call that put us a man down," says Thompson, "but we played as a team and answered back."

Radford pressed the ’Cats in the overtime periods, out-shooting them 8-3. An impressive stand by goalie Sarah Nolan ’05 and the Wildcat defense kept the Highlanders at bay, with multiple defensive saves, including one by captain Kathleen Fenn ’04. The ’Cats finally answered with a score by Davis, her second of the game.

The Davidson win streak, which weathered the “week of grass,” has garnered the team some acclaim among their Norpac peers. Tiffany Homan ’05 was recently named Norpac Offensive Player of the Week. Homan was the decisive factor in Davidson’s overtime victory against Appalachian State a week ago, one of the ’Cats’ biggest wins thus far. She followed up this performance with two more goals against Saint Francis in the following contest. "The conference was recognizing not just me but the entire team," says Homan. "It is nice to get recognition for all of our efforts."

The ’Cats look to continue their winning streak as they return to action and Astroturf this Saturday in a home match against Albany. Face-off is set for 11 a.m.

The football team failed three times to impress the home crowd to open the season. They return this weekend, however, following the shellacking of two competitive teams, Butler and Emory and Henry, to start off the homecoming festivities at 1 p.m. on Saturday. For the team, this week ought to be a true homecoming, as the players have fought off the adversity of an injury-plagued 0-3 start with their blowout road victories and should be ready to show off their newly developed offense.

But this homecoming match-up will be no blatant Florida State-Duke demolition. In fact, their Dayton opponent boasts the second-ranked I-AA defense in the nation, allowing a mere seven touchdowns in five games for a scant average of 9.2 points per game. To make matters worse, they are riding on a thirteen-game winning streak, the longest of any I-AA team.School in the nation, and the four-time defending PFL champions are currently ranked No. 1 in the Sports Network and Football Gazette I-AA mid-major polls. If nothing else, though, Davidson should be ready to take on the challenge, pumped up as ever after a couple of well-executed victories and ready to even their record at 3-3 and win back the home crowd. “It’s a lot better going into the Dayton game 2-3 vs. 0-5,” said running back John Leverett ’05. “We're sitting at the point where we can even up the season, and with the success we had these two weeks, it could be the confidence boost we need to win this game.”

Handling the QB duties will be Damion White ’05, who will hope to impress fans with his suddenly savvy play. “He’s been hot,” exclaimed head coach Mike Toop on his starting QB. “You’ve got to ride the hot hand. He’s doing things we expected him to do at this point.” Of this Dayton team, fans should expect a powerful, repetitive offense, pounding the ball while searching for the big play. “They’ll line up on offense with one formation and run the ball at you,” said Toop. “It’s fun to watch them... They play fast and real, real hard. They basically will run five plays and run them to death and execute.”

The game could be decided, however, by the Davidson offense’s ability to keep pace with Dayton. If White, Leverett, and the receiving corps can’t find ways to keep the scoreboard worker busy, it could be a long afternoon. The continued solid play of the resurrected offensive line will be key as well, as they desperately need to continue opening holes for the running game and keeping pass protection solid. Leverett understands the importance of giving the home crowd a victory, especially since the last memory in students’ minds is the San Diego fiasco. “I hope we get this win and [fans] come down and tear down the goalpost,” he said. “They haven’t seen us win yet. They’ve only been able to read about it from the newspaper, so it would be good for them to actually see it.”

Fillnow paces cross country

As seems to be the case every week, Jonathan Baker ’06 and Kelly Fillnow ’05 set the pace for the Wildcats this past weekend at the 2003 Great American Cross Country Festival. Fillnow, who finished the race in 18:57, came in third place overall in the women’s 5K university division out of an incredible 122 runners. Meanwhile, Baker’s time qualified him for 18th place among the men in the longer 8K race.

Gaining more experience with every race, Fillnow was able to help pace teammate Sally Stanhope ’05, who finished four seconds off her season-best time at 19:40, good enough for 18th place. Rounding out the top six for the women were Allie Martin ’06 (20:06), Jenna Kruppa ’04 (20:15), Laura Puckett ’04 (20:33), and Carolyn Mohr ’06 (21:39). With a combined average time of 19:54.64, the Wildcats finished fourth as a team out of 18, an impressive result for the women. Normally, they only compete against six or eight other schools, but the increase in opponents did not seem to phase the ’Cats in the least. On a whole, the performance was a great gauge of their ability against a number of larger schools.

As for the men, Baker’s time of 28:15 aided in their team finish of 10th place out of 21 teams. Not quite as strong as their female counterparts, the men nonetheless had their own bright points, including Austin Mercadante ’06 who set a new personal season low time of 29:02 as he was second to cross the finish line for the ’Cats. The other four top runners for Davidson were Dave Bunge ’04 (29:28), Matt Rhodes ’07 (29:38), Greg Scott ’04 (29:56), and Ben Gaspar ’04 (30:35). The Wildcats’ average time was 29:16.44.

Next week the women compete at the Blue Ridge Mountain Open in Boone, N.C., on Friday. The men will be running at the Paul Short Run in Bethlehem, Pa., on Saturday.
