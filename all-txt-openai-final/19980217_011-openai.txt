THE DAVIDSONIAN

Managers integral part of Wildcat basketball

Hudson, Kizner, and Porath help to keep the team together and functioning

Imagine this: Mark Donnely steps to the line with one second remaining in Davidson’s contest versus Appalachian State. The score is tied. One foul shot would give the Wildcats the win and secure their first-place position in the Southern Athletic Conference. App State head coach Buzz Peterson calls timeout to ice the Wildcat sniper. Donnely’s uniform lays heavy and drenched in sweat from a grueling offensive and defensive battle with opposing Mountaineer Tige Darner as the battle-scarred Wildcat heads to the bench. He grabs a towel to wipe his forehead, sopping with perspiration. While Donnely mops the sweat once more from the palms of his hands and drops the towel on the floor, he closes his eyes to focus on the task at hand. Meanwhile, amid all the excitement, only one question echoes throughout the minds of the Davidson student body and all Wildcat fanatics. Who is going to pick up that sweaty towel?!?

While laundry may not be the biggest focus of Davidson basketball diehards, the managers of the men's basketball team have become a special part of the Wildcat ballclub. Half an hour before every basketball practice in the John M. Belk Arena, three young, dedicated freshmen are already at work setting up a vast array of cones, jump ropes, and practice gear, preparing for the day’s workout. And amid squeaking sneakers, sweaty tank tops, and shouting coaches, the three young women also serve as extra passers in the Wildcat’s drills. “We take it for granted, but we’ll come running out for practice, and all the stuff we need will be right where we need it. We always count on them,” stated freshman hopeful Travis Ezzelle. But Beth Hudson, Cat Kizner, and Carrie Porath are more than just managers. “It’s almost like they are part of our team,” said starting sophomore forward Stephen Marshall, “except they have to wipe up our sweat and stuff.”

The tightly-knit atmosphere that characterizes the Wildcat team has expanded to include the managers as well. “It’s kind of like since they have become part of our team, they have also become part of our family,” voiced injured swingman Emeka Erege. The three managers gave him a white stuffed animal to keep his spirits high while being treated for a broken leg. “I call him Pookie,” smiled Erege. The friendly triad has become special in the hearts of all the players. While the threesome does not quite share a fondness for picking up dirty towels and handing out cups of water, it does share a common love for basketball. All three managers starred on their teams in high school and contemplated playing here at Davidson, but shied away from the sport for time commitment reasons. Still, the thrill of courtside seats excites each one. Kizner reflected, “The best part of the job is definitely being right there behind the bench, especially during timeouts, hearing what the coach is saying and what the players are doing. It is just exciting.”

Yes, the rookie managers clad themselves in slacks, sweaters, and loafers instead of red and white uniforms and Nikes, but they must sometimes commit more time to the team than the players do. Game days require that the rookie managers be present an hour before tipoff, and for away games, they have the not-so-rewarding job of cleaning up the buses after road trips. Porath heard the basketball team was in dire need of managers while answering phones in the athletic office and gathered Second Belk hallmates Kizner and Hudson at the start of the season. An athlete herself, Porath plays goalie on the soccer team. “I just have a genuine love for the game, and the chance to be in the gym every day helping a Division I program like Davidson was an opportunity that I couldn’t let pass me by.” Though it qualifies for work-study credit for Kizner and Porath, Hudson manages on a completely volunteer basis for a game she loves. However, due to her dedication to the team, she was away on a road trip to Appalachian State and unavailable to comment for this issue. So during that timeout in the final seconds, when Mark Donnely is a foul shot away from clinching an NCAA tourney bid for the Wildcats, everyone will know Porath, Hudson, and Kizner will be right behind them. Literally — behind the bench, as an integral part of the Davidson team.

Baseball team wins two against Cincinnati Bearcats

In the fifth, the Bearcats' center-fielder Jud McMillin got things started with a double. The next batter, Scott Heller, hit the ball in the gap between first and second. Drew Williams made a spectacular play as he dove to his left, snagged the ball, and threw to first for the out, saving a definite run. Not to be outdone, on the next play, catcher Dom Talvacchio dove behind the plate to catch a pop-up. It was another tremendous play. In the sixth and seventh innings, Stroker used the double play tandem of Ben Brown and Drew Williams to end the Bearcat threat. Stewart Sloan, who has been crushing the ball, started things in the bottom of the fifth. Sloan hit a long fly ball to the fence where it was dropped by right-fielder Matt Singer. Davidson was able to take advantage of the two-base error as the next batter, Talvacchio, knocked Sloan home on a single. After two singles by Williams and Brown, Brian Joyce stepped up to the plate with the bases loaded. Talvacchio scored when Joyce made out on a fielder’s choice. Williams followed Talvacchio as he scored on an error by Cincinnati’s third-baseman Kevin Youkilis. Davidson put the game away in the bottom of the seventh with five runs on five hits. Joyce, DeSimone, Sloan, Talvacchio, and Luke Goodwin all had hits. DeSimone and Sloan each had an RBI in the inning. Talvacchio capped off a strong performance as he finished 3-4 with 3 RBIs. DeSimone relieved Stroker as he pitched two no-hit innings. Ryan Stroker isn’t the only freshman who will play an important part this season. Starting right-fielder Jeremiah Parvin had a strong game on Saturday going 1-3, with an RBI, two runs, and two stolen bases. Friday’s starter, Wes Self, showed promise in his six-plus innings of pitching. Mike Torres, a second baseman from Yonkers, New York, started against South Carolina. “The freshmen will be integral for our success this year,” said

minutes, the squad took a promising one-point lead into the locker room. A 9-2 Davidson spurt to start the second half spelled defeat forthe Spartans, who fell to 7-17, 5-8 in the Southern Conference. Meanwhile, the Wildcats won their sixth straight and eighth in nine games, improving to 14-9, and 10-2 in league action, heading into last night’s contest at VMI. Thursday night’s home date with Appalachian St. will likely determine the conference’s North Division champion and top seed in the upcoming league tournament at the Greensboro Coliseum.

Wildcats 67, East Tennessee St. 47

Behind an efficient 18 points on 7-for-10 shooting by Mark Donnelly, the Wildcats bettered East Tennessee St. for the second time this season last Monday night at Belk, winning 67-47. Davidson shot 56.3 percent from the field, while limiting ETSU to 33.3 percent, including a 2-for-14 performance from beyond the three-point line.

“Our guys didn’t have a lot of confidence playing Davidson,” said Bucs coach Ed DeChellis, whose squad lost by 50 in Belk last year. “I think we’ve got some older guys in our program who don’t really believe they can win against Davidson.”

ETSU’s Greg Stephens, the Southern’s third-leading scorer, was held to just 12 points after pouring in 27 earlier this year against the Wildcats in Johnson City.

Pollard, “Everyone will get to prove themselves.”

On Friday afternoon, the freshman who made the biggest impact was a Bearcat, not a Wildcat. Cincinnati's DH Craig Tewes homered in his first collegiate at-bat. In the seventh inning, Tewes put the Bearcats up 8-2 with his second three-run home run of the game. This home run came off Stroker, who had come in relief of Fritz Porter.

In his first collegiate start, Wes Self had some good moments. After giving up the home run to Tewes, Self retired 12 of the next 13 batters before struggling in the fifth. In Friday’s match-up, Davidson struggled at the plate. The first three hitters in the lineup went a combined 1-11, with three strikeouts. Marshall Tyler, the new starting third baseman, had a good game at the plate with two doubles. Catcher Kurt Davis also had two hits on the day. In the end, Davidson fell to Cincinnati 9-3.

Whereas Davidson struggled at the plate on Friday, they rocked Cincinnati starter Casey McEvoy for eight runs in just one and a third innings. The barrage continued all afternoon as Davidson managed 12 runs on 12 hits. All but one starter for the Cats had a hit. Marshall Tyler and Stewart Sloan both continued to hit well. Tyler went 3-5 with four RBIs, while Sloan went 3-4 with four RBIs, also. Sloan had both a double and a triple.

On the basepaths, Davidson managed nine stolen bases against catcher Matt Bechtol. The high man was Brian Joyce with four. Luke Goodwin and Jeremiah Parvin managed two apiece. Davidson starter Eric Bowers had a career-high nine strikeouts in five and two-thirds innings of work. Given an eight-run lead, Bowers struggled at times as he gave up six runs on 11 hits. After letting Cincinnati back in the game, Davidson scored two runs in the bottom of the fifth and one in the bottom of the sixth. Bowers was relieved by sophomore Garland Yarborough. Yarborough gave the Wildcats three and a third innings of near-perfect relief. He struck out three and only gave up one hit. His only mistake occurred in the top of the ninth when Cincinnati’s Greg Dikos homered.

Now Davidson looks towards a home match-up against arch-rival UNCC on Wednesday. The tough Southern Conference schedule doesn’t begin for several weeks. When asked about prospects in the conference, coach Pollard said, “You can expect the typical mix of Western Carolina, Citadel, Georgia Southern, and UNCG at the top,” but also said, “We took two out of three from a very good team this weekend. Hopefully, we'll be able to get everything to click, and we’ll surprise some teams.”
