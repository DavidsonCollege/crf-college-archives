Men’s soccer stumbles into off-season

After a strong mid-season run, the men’s soccer team closed out their 2000 campaign with four straight losses. Any hope of an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament also evaporated, as the Cats turned in sub-par performances against their final two opponents.

The debacle started with an important match against the UNCG Spartans. The first half saw good action from both teams, but UNCG drew first blood. A questionable penalty was called on sophomore goalie Soren Johnson, a call that quickly turned into a 1-0 Spartan lead. The Cats rebounded well, as junior Erik Ozimek equalized a few minutes later, but the momentum slowly faded from the Cats’ play. UNCG scored again minutes before halftime and again only a few minutes after the break. Junior Jeremy Kilburn gave the restless crowd some reason to stay and watch, as he answered UNCG’s third goal four minutes later. However, a late goal scored on a counter-attack left the Cats with a bitter 4-2 defeat.

Saturday afternoon offered the Cats a beautiful afternoon in which to redeem themselves against the Spiders of the University of Richmond. The five Wildcat seniors, Dave Buehler, Dane Erickson, Bryan Garrett, Ikenna Myers, and Pat Miller looked to close their impressive careers on a high note. The Wildcat faithful trumpeted their support for the seniors’ dedication. Although the Cats and Spiders battled without scoring...

Number four takes on special meaning

Four. It seems like a rather normal number. It’s even. One wouldn’t think it to be an “odd” number. Well, it isn’t! It’s just been an unlucky one for the women’s soccer team lately. Losing by four in their past two games; allowing 3 goals within the span of four minutes; taking only four shots in their past two losses; falling to fourth seed going into the tournament—all of this evidence would make most believe that the number four should be somehow eliminated from the minds of the entire Davidson team (at least until after the tournament). But maybe the number four isn’t as unlucky as it appears. We’ll get to that later.

In a recap of last week’s games... Last Wednesday, the Wildcats traveled to Spry Stadium to take on the Demon Deacons of Wake Forest University. Coming into the match, the Deacs held a 7-7-1 record. Their ACC experience showed early in the game by putting away three goals before halftime. Goal number one came in the 10th minute off of a shot drilled into the lower right 90 by Wake junior Sarah Kate Noftsinger. After a hard-fought 14 minutes, Emily Taggart scored Wake’s second goal with Noftsinger’s help. Freshman Alena Thom netted her first collegiate goal just one minute after checking into the game when she collected a pass from teammate Katie Johnson. The Deacs’ final goal on the night came in the 54th minute as Wake sophomore forward Joline Charlton blew past the Davidson defense to rip a hard shot over Corrigan. Wake Forest barraged the Davidson goal with 27 shots, converting on four for the win. Unfortunately, the Cats were only able to come up with two shots on goal, one in the first and one in the second. Corrigan had 10 saves in her 69 minutes in goal, while sophomore Sarah Henry kept goal for the remainder of the game, making three saves of her own.

On Saturday, the women’s soccer team traveled to Greensboro to take on conference rival, UNC-Greensboro. Tied for second in the Southern Conference, the Cats needed a win to remain the second seed going into tournament play on Friday. Yet the Spartans were determined to shut down the Cats from the very beginning of the game. Their first goal was scored on a header off of a direct kick just 14 minutes into the first half. Junior fullback Meredith Seawell took the direct kick for the Spartans from about 25 yards out where midfielder Kate Dylag got a head on the ball. Dylag was credited with the assist as Spartan forward Jenny Moore redirected it into the goal. Both teams were held scoreless throughout the remainder of the first half.

The second half saw spectacular finishes by the Spartans as the Davidson defense broke down to allow three goals in the span of just four minutes. At 60:16, a scramble in the box following a UNCG corner kick resulted in a goal by sophomore forward Cheryl Stewart, who blasted a shot past the outstretched arms of Corrigan. And the final goal of the evening came only 53 seconds later, as Jenny Moore headed in her second goal of the night, off of junior Dana Arrowood’s cross. Corrigan made four saves on the evening, while the Cats offense was limited to only two shots, both of which came in the final 16 minutes of the match.For most of the game, Richmond dominated statistically. Soren Johnson noted that the game marked “the first time that we defended for most of the game.” Johnson enjoyed a good statistical day, making a season-high 11 saves. However, with less than five minutes to play, the seemingly inevitable happened, as a soft Spider’s shot dribbled past Johnson, giving Richmond a 1-0 victory. The earlier loss to UNCG left the Cats in a three-way tie for second place in the Southern Conference. The Cats’ seed in the conference would come down to a draw between Davidson, UNCG, and Appalachian State. Luck finally smiled on the Cats, as they earned the second-place seed. More importantly, UNCG came out of the draw with the fourth seed, which means that the Cats will not have to face both UNCG and Furman to win the conference tournament. Despite the poor finish to the season, the Cats still have hopes of reaching the NCAA tournament. Johnson asserted, “the bracket’s in our favor. I’m very optimistic.” Senior Dane Erickson echoed Johnson’s optimism, saying, “We’re very confident that we can beat any team in the conference. We need to win three games in four days.” The Cats have been given a second chance and, as long as they play to their potential, a remedy for the past four games might still exist.

### Meaning for Women’s Soccer

Despite two tough losses going into the Southern Conference tournament, the Davidson women’s soccer team has plenty on its side (even the fours). The inconsistent play by many of their opponents this season has shown that anything is possible going into the postseason. A team like Wake Forest defeats the #5 Tarheels one day, while struggling in double overtime to defeat nationally ranked NC State (who the Cats shut out earlier in the season). SoCon leader Furman has been nationally ranked one week, while barely noticed the next. Tournament time means a clean slate, a fresh start. So now the time has arrived for the best teams to show themselves. With less than four days until their quarterfinal match versus Wofford, the Cats are still a strong contender for the title. And it has been four long years since they have won the SoCon championship. Last year, they proved how badly they wanted it in four overtimes against Furman. This year, they are fortunate enough to have two dedicated seniors that will be playing in their fourth SoCon tournament. And better yet, they have Heather Maloney ’03, who is fourth in the country in points per game and ninth in goals per game. She is also ranked in the top four in the conference in almost every statistical category (except goalkeeping). At 13-6 (6-3 in SoCon) closing out the regular season, these Cats have proved that they can hold their own against teams like NC State and USC. Now they must prove to themselves that they are the best team in the Southern Conference. Because everyone else already knows it.

### Seniors, from page 12

Sarah Falconi, the kind-hearted defender from Cincinnati, grew into her shoes over the past few years as well. Although Sarah’s only goal came in her sophomore year, no one would argue that she has not been a dominant force on the field. She has started in every game for the Cats since then. Those who know Sarah would say she is one of the nicest people they know. But on the soccer field, she is a pure force to be reckoned with. Her combination of experience and solid skills has made her one of the most talented defensive players on the team. Over the past four years, Sarah has proven herself to be the anchor of one of the best defenses in the Southern Conference. Described by her teammates as “supportive” and “encouraging,” she has earned tremendous respect from her coaches over the past four years. Although she has not received as much recognition as some of her teammates, her reputation as a dedicated and hard-working student-athlete is well-known off the soccer field. Coach Tisdale praises Falconi as “someone who is looked up to because of the trueness of her character and, who in her own humble way, strives for nothing else but the best for her team.” Sarah has consistently given everything she has on the field. And because of that, she has inspired her teammates to do the same after she’s gone.

The Davidson women’s soccer team has improved greatly over the past four years. Going from 4-13 to 13-6 is something that these seniors can be proud of. Going from losing to South Carolina 5-0 in 1997 to defeating them 3-1 in 2000 is something to be proud of. Going from losing to UNC Asheville 2-1 in OT in 1998 to crushing them 7-2 in 2000 is something to be proud of. Going from losing 4-1 in 1997 to an ACC team like NC State, to holding them scoreless in a 1-0 win in 2000 is impressive. And the list could go on. But what is most impressive about the improvement this team has made is that along the way it has created leaders. As the soccer careers of Winnie and Sarah come to a close, the underclassmen have some big shoes to fill. And the way things are looking, they are more than up to the task.
