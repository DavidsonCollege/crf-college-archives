Schaper Shines in Goal in Loss to UNCG

By Jen Lake

The Davidson women’s soccer team split a pair of games last week with Coker (a 6-1 win) and UNC-Greensboro (a
2-0 loss), proving that it can put lesser teams in their place soundly and also play on even terms with
stiff Division I competition. The Wildcats hosted nationally-prominent UNCG Friday afternoon and fell short in a close match.

Goalie Liz Schaper controlled the box to keep Davidson in the game, recording 14 saves. The score was 1-0 for
the majority of the game, and the ‘Cats generated several scoring opportunities that were barely blocked by the Spartan defense.
UNCG scored in the final minutes to seal the victory.

Earlier in the week Davidson exhibited a more successful team effort against Coker. The Wildcats spread the scoring around in
a 6-1 win. The game was 2-1 at halftime, with the Coker goal scored by the Davidson defense, but the
‘Cats put the game away in the second half. Claudia Lombard led the scoring with two goals and Heather Wineberg
found the net on a penalty kick. Sally Graham and Erin Butcher came off the bench to score a goal
apiece. Jenny Satterfield made a run down the field to deflect the ball in for the team’s sixth goal. Courtney
Robertson ran the defense at goalkeeper for most of the game. The win was a stabilizer for Davidson in preparation
for the UNCG game.

The rest of the season will be an uphill battle for the Wildcats (7-4), as they face a string of
tough Division I opponents. They face Elon Tuesday at home and travel to Mercer Thursday. Over Fall Break, the team
will road trip to Kentucky and Vanderbilt for weekend games.

game was the biggest win of my coaching career; this win today was much sweeter.” After the game, junior Jill
Bennett and Roos dumped the water cooler on Pryor to celebrate the victory.

Davidson’s game against Appalachian State was rained out, but was rescheduled for October 31. It will be the team’s last
home game of the season before the post-season tournament.

Davidson faced Pfeiffer at home on Wednesday and won 7-0 on a very wet field. The ‘Cats outshot Pfeiffer 34-1.
Roos led the scoring with two goals and was followed up by Nicole Ficeto, Nancy Hilles, Plaisance, Hardesty, and Holly
Kledis. Sophomore Mary Ferguson earned her first start and gave the Wildcats their sixth shutout. Their record stands at 7-2.

Davidson faces ACC rival Wake Forest here on Wednesday at 4:30. The team travels to Louisville, Ky. over fall break
to face Louisville and St. Louis.
