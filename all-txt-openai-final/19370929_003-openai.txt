Outstanding Men Receive Awards For High Grades | Mrs. Gray and Ken Scott Receive Algernon Sydney Sullivan Medal

SIX AWARDS ARE GIVEN
Carlson and Patterson Tie for Bible Medal

Six awards were made at the 1937 graduation exercises to members of the Davidson student body and to friends of the college. The William Banks Biblical Medal, which is awarded annually to the member of the senior class having the highest average in the department of Bible during his four years’ work, was given to two seniors, Carl H. Carlson, Jr., and Russell H. Patterson, who tied for the honor.

The Alumni Association Medal given each year to the member of the freshman class having the highest average for that particular year was given to Samuel R. Spencer. The Mrs. F. J. Hay, Sr. Bible medal awarded to the freshman having the highest average in that subject during his first year was also awarded to two men because of a tie. J. R. Phipps and S. R. Spencer were the recipients of this award.

The Algernon Sydney Sullivan award, given to the friend of the college and to the member of the student body of the college who renders the most unselfish service to the college, was given to Mrs. W. R. Gray, wife of Dr. W. R. Gray, and to Kenneth Scott, member of the Centennial class.

Two other special awards were made by the Greek and French departments of the college. The class of 1922 Book Prize was given to Mr. W. S. Robinson, who is a junior in Davidson this year. The prize is given for the best average in Greek for the freshman and sophomore years. For excellence in French, John Winn, 1937 graduate, received the French medal.

Leaders of “Y” Fix Programs

The Sunday school programs for the coming year are in charge of the “Y” officers of that branch elected last spring. They are: President, Marion Bryant; Vice-President, Robert King; Secretary and Treasurer, Warren Weldon, who did not return to Davidson this fall. His position will be given to someone else shortly. The officers are planning to make the Sunday School programs a popular affair with the student body. To this end they have arranged to have outside musical talent brought here.

Outstanding speakers are scheduled for the program, some being Dr. Kenneth J. Foreman, Prof. Ernest A. Beaty, Dr. P. H. Gwynn, Prof. Archibald Currie, Dr. C. K. Brown, Dr. H. B. Arbuckle, Dr. Scott C. Lyons, and others to be announced later. The services for the entire year will be held in Shearer Hall, at the customary time, 10:15.

Varsity Singers Are Organized For Year

Thirty Men to Be Under MacDonald’s Direction

The Varsity Glee Club for 1937-1938 has been organized, and is under the capable direction of Prof. O'Hane MacDonald. The membership in the club numbers thirty men. There are six freshmen, who will take care of the vacancies left by the senior members who graduated last year. This group will form the Vesper Choir for the Sunday evening services for the entire year. Just as last year, there are two Glee Clubs, the second club being a reserve group in case there are a great number of vacancies in the varsity club through the year.

The varsity club meets three times a week in Shearer Hall on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoons. The second club meets twice a week in the same place on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. Glee club can be taken for credit, with the addition of a one-hour class during the week. This class consists of the study and performance of the best in the way of glee club literature and its purpose is to acquaint the student with the appreciation of the many types of musical literature. According to Prof. MacDonald,

Rhythm For Erskine Battle Is Furnished By Variety Of Bands

Davidson Plays Host to Musicians from Nine High Schools

Davidson played host to nine high school bands from North and South Carolina last Saturday at the Erskine game in addition to the number of high school football teams that were present. Bands from the following nearby towns were present: Albemarle, Gastonia, Kannapolis, Kings Mountain, Marshville, Monroe, Rock Hill, S.C., and York, S.C. The large band from the R. J. Reynolds high school in Winston-Salem also attended the game.

These bands arrived about 1:30 Saturday, and assembled in uniform on Richardson field about 2:00. Then, they paraded in front of the west side of the stadium and marched around the field, taking their seats in the north end of the east section of the stadium. Each band played from time to time during the game, and at the half they all assembled in the center of the field. These bands returned to their respective home-towns after the game in specially chartered buses.

Colonel’s Daughter to Wed! Dr. Hugh West of Deland

CEREMONY IN OCTOBER
Couple Plans to Take Honeymoon in Europe

Of unusual interest to the people of Davidson and the Carolinas is the announcement made by Lieut.-Col. and Mrs. John Taylor Rhett of the engagement of their daughter, Elizabeth Ann Rhett, to Dr. Hugh West of DeLand, Fla., the ceremony to be held on October 9th, at the home of Lieut.-Col. and Mrs. Rhett. The popular bride-elect attended Converse College for two years and then attended Davidson College. A freshman studying Spanish, Miss Rhett was planning to enter Duke as a senior this year, but she changed her plans. The groom is an outstanding young surgeon in the Florida city, and the couple will make their home there in DeLand. They are planning a honeymoon in Europe, and will spend the fall months on the continent. The plans are for a small home wedding with the ceremony being performed by the Reverend H. M. Moffett, pastor of the Davidson Presbyterian Church. There will be no invitations.

The following excerpt is taken from the popular Charlotte Observer column, “Rosalind to Celia:”

“Pretty Elizabeth Ann Rhett, daughter of Lieut.-Col. and Mrs. John Taylor Rhett of Davidson was scheduled to leave last Monday for Duke University, where she was to be a senior. But her plans were slightly changed when she declared her preference for marriage over college.

Seven Famous Stars Will Give Concert in Queen City
Tuesday
Iturbi, Hackett, Meisle, Vreeland to Appear in Afternoon Recital
TO GIVE TWO CONCERTS
Are World-Famous For Their Work

A one-day—two concert music festival will be presented in Charlotte on October 5. Seven great international stars of the operatic and concert world have been engaged to take part in the program, which will be in the Armory. In the cast there will be five vocalists and two instrumentalists, and such names as the world-famous baritone, John Charles Thomas; Gina Cigna, the new sensational dramatic soprano of the Metropolitan Opera; Charles Hackett, America’s romantic tenor; Kathryn Meisle, the contralto with the golden voice and superlative artistry; Jose Iturbi, the wizard of the piano; Jeanette Vreeland, America's favorite concert star; and Iso Briselli, the brilliant young Russian violinist, who recently came to this country to make his sensational debut with the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra.

There will be two concerts—one in the afternoon at which four artists, Kathryn Meisle, Jeanette Vreeland, Charles Hackett, and Jose Iturbi, will appear and in the evening all seven stars will take part in the performance. Most of the artists spent their summers abroad and Gina Cigna lands in New York from her home in Italy only a few days before her Charlotte engagement. She has just completed, this past year, a very successful season at the Metropolitan, and will be making her premier appearance in Charlotte during the Music Festival.

Proceeds from the festival will be devoted to a worthy Charlotte charity.

“Y” Exchange Sells Books
To Become Permanent Fixture on Campus

One of the recent additions to the Y. M. C. A. is the “Y” Book Exchange, which is located in the Social Center. The Book Exchange was started last year and according to Watson Street began on a large scale, selling about $130.00 worth of books. He stated that this year was even better than last year and according to expectations, would be a permanent fixture on the campus.

Students desiring to sell books leave them at the exchange, after setting their own price on the books and an effort is made to sell them. Seniors also are asked to leave their books and when sold they will receive the money by mail. The Exchange pays postage in itself, although it is not a money-making organization. The exchange remained open for about four days in the fall and will be open one week during the mid-semester period.

Yates for the sophomores and Charles Brown for the freshmen. It is the duty of these men to organize the teams of their classes and to enter them in inter-class competitions. They are to look after each sport as the seasons come round and do their best to make their class have the winning team in the intra-mural sports.

New Club to Start Work Next Month
Student Body and Faculty Very Much Interested in New Business Club

An interested student nucleus has already been formed, and faculty interest has been shown toward establishing a club at Davidson for those upperclassmen interested in business and commerce as a life occupation. Henry Harkey, Elmore Holt, and Charlie Brown have been conferring with Professors Williams and O'Connor, business professors, and expect to present details to the student body. The first meeting of the club will probably be called sometime in October, and seniors taking at least one business and one social science course will be invited to attend. Charter membership will be limited to 25. Prof. Williams is already approaching other colleges concerning the advisability of securing a chapter of some national organization of this type, although it is not planned to petition within the immediate future.

Efforts have been made for the past several years to found a club of this type. Its value will lie in affording its members an opportunity to keep up with modern business under adult guidance. Outstanding business men from this section of the state will be asked to address the club. Beside being afforded first-hand information, the club members will make contacts that may be helpful in later business life.

ALUMNI JOURNAL TO APPEAR SOON

The first Alumni Journal will be sent to the Alumni of Davidson College by the middle of October, Fred Smith, publicity director of Davidson College, has announced. Two other issues will be made during this year.

This October edition will contain an article by Professor Bythe on his travels in Germany and Italy this summer. Professor Avery Patton will also have an article dealing with Davidson men of science and medicine. Dr. George F. Robertson, of the class of ‘78 who is now a retired Presbyterian minister, will be the author of an article which will depict the life of Davidson students in the 70's.

A survey of the football games of the season will be in the issue. The games already played at that time will be reviewed and those to be played will be discussed. Every effort is being made to make the Journal as attractive and as interesting as possible to the Alumni.
