Great Alumni Meeting Held in Chattanooga Last Wednesday Night

Over One Hundred Former Students Attend Dinner From Thirteen States and Two Foreign Countries

THIRTY-FOUR CLASSES

Dr. W. M. Anderson, of Dallas, Texas, Thrilled Hearers With Outside Viewpoint of Davidson

Over one hundred Davidson College alumni, representing 34 different classes, 13 states and two foreign countries, gathered in the banquet hall of the First Presbyterian Church at Chattanooga, Tenn., on Wednesday, February 18, for what is believed to have been one of the greatest alumni meetings ever staged. These men were attending the World Congress on Missions, and were invited to this meeting to listen to Davidson students, other alumni and friends of the college. Elsewhere on this page, a list of those who filled out cards is given: Carl R. Pritchett, '30, Y. M. C. A. secretary at Davidson and toastmaster of the occasion, has also recounted some observations, and has reported in detail the remarks of Dr. W. M. Anderson, of Dallas, Texas, who was invited to give an outsider’s opinion of Davidson. Every student who attended the dinner has been talking about the glowing remarks of this popular minister.

Wood, of the Senior class, opened the series of talks by discussing Davidson’s “Perpetual Heritage.” The spirit of the student body, the work of the Y. M. C. A., the athletic prestige, and the traditions which had been handed down were mentioned, and he also cited some of the newer traditional institutions that had had their inception during the past few years.

Charles Norfleet, Sophomore president, spoke on the subject, “What Davidson Students Expect of Davidson Alumni.” He contended that Davidson students expect the alumni to send the right kind of student to Davidson to uphold the standards and ideals already on the campus, and said that the students always wanted a continued interest from the alumni in the affairs of the student body.

The third student who spoke was J. A. Jones, of the Senior class. His topic was “Davidsonian Contacts.” These were obtained through the attendance of alumni at athletic contests, through the records of Davidson students in graduate schools, through the alumni office, and through the alumni themselves in their daily associations in all parts of the world.

The remarks of Dr. Ben R. Lacy, ’06, and Dr. Anderson immediately followed, and the meeting adjourned in time for the night session.

Dr. Bill Anderson of Dallas, Texas, in a few choice words gave an “Outsider’s Viewpoint of Davidson” to close the remarks of the evening. He conducted the spring services on the campus last spring and so had an excellent opportunity to come into contact with the spirit of the student body. He thrilled those present by the glowing tribute which he paid to the spirit of our school. He said there were three things which stood out in his mind as elements upon which our spirit was based:
1. The real manhood of the student body which had the stamp of character.
2. The unafraid and unashamed Christian spirit which pervaded the campus life.
3. The fact that the leaders in theThe student body actively stood out first of all as Christian gentlemen in the truest sense of the word and exerted every energy that the spirit of Christ might dominate the campus life. After his words, the Davidson men present were proud indeed to be a part of the spirit of Davidson. Dr. Ben Lacy spoke for a few minutes on “What Davidson alumni expect of Davidson Students” and his stirring words constituted a real challenge to Davidson men. He spoke of the crying need for unafraid Christian men and particularly was this true in the work of the Church. He appealed to Davidson men to respond to this need for he stated, “If this leadership does not come from schools such as ours, from whence will it come?”

Presbyterian College held their alumni banquet in a hall adjoining the one in which the Davidson alumni held forth and the yells and songs reminded one of the days of gridiron rivalry. Though the heads of some were powdered with grey and others mirrors of reflected light, they yelled none the less heartily. In keeping with the spirit of both schools, both complimented the other with a yell. One recent alumnus with his hand in his coat pocket went through the group eagerly searching for his classmates to proudly exhibit to them a picture of a “Little Davidson.” J. A. Jones, who spoke at the meeting, said that the Wildcat spirit was a bachelor spirit—it never settled down.

Davidson alumni, who are members of the board of trustees, and who were here for the mid-winter meeting of that body last Wednesday, were John D. Baker, ’86, Jacksonville, Fla.; H. N. Pharr, Charlotte; Dr. Byron Clark, '90, Salisbury; Rev. E. D. Brown, ’93, Statesville; Rev. W. C. Brown, '93, Barium Springs; Dr. C. E. Hodgin, '94, Greensboro; Dr. W. M. Fairley, '95, Raeford; Dr. J. P. Matheson, '99, Charlotte; Sam A. Robinson, ’99, Gastonia; W. S. Royster, '99, Norfolk, Va.; T. D. Dupuy, ‘01, Greensboro; Dr. A. R. McQueen, '03, Dunn; J. Archie Cannon, '04, Concord; Dr. Hamilton W. McKay, '06, Charlotte; I. P. Graham, '08, Cooleemee; Rev. T. G. Tate, '10, Gastonia; Rev. R. S. Arrowood, ’13, Concord; James C. Harper, '15; Prof. K. A. McDonald, '16, Hope Mills; R. J. Knight, '22, Safety Harbor, Fla.

Other alumni visitors to the campus last week included Prof. J. A. Tillinghast, '91, Spartanburg, S. C.; H. W. Glasgow, ’92, Charlotte; F. I. Hashagen, Jr., ’07, Gastonia; Dr. W. Z. Bradford, ’24, Charlotte; John D. Baker, Jr., '25, Jacksonville, Fla., and Morgan B. Spier, '26, Charlotte. Chalmers R. Carr, '28, and Monroe T. Gilmour, ’29, have entered the medical school at the University of North Carolina. Mr. Carr has been working in Philadelphia since his graduation. Mr. Gilmour studied at Princeton last year.

Rev. J. T. Pharr, '12, of Cass, W. Va., and Rev. W. A. Benfield, ’11, of Sinks Grove, W. Va., the latter moderator of the Synod of West Virginia for 1931, have recently completed a successful two weeks’ evangelistic service in the Cass Presbyterian Church. Rev. Harry Alexander, '25, who completed his seminary training at Louisville last May, was recently ordained into the ministry, and was installed as pastor of the Carlisle (Ky.) Presbyterian Church.

Friends will regret to learn of the death of Dr. J. C. Montgomery, of Charlotte, father of C. R. Montgomery, ‘95, of Greensboro, and J. C. Montgomery, Jr., ’28, student at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School; also of the death of L. P. Hornthal, father of L. P. Hornthal, Jr., '29, of Plymouth, N. C.

Information has recently been received in the alumni office that the doctor of divinity degree was conferred upon Rev. Robert W. Miles last June by Washington and Lee. Dr. Miles is pastor of the Westminster Presbyterian Church of Lynchburg, Va. During the week of February 1-6, he preached every day to the V. M. I. cadet corps.

Alumni in Washington Are Meeting Tonight
Dr. Walter L. Lingle, Davidson President, Will Be Guest of Honor and Principal Speaker

Davidson College alumni residing in Washington, D. C., and points nearby will hold their annual dinner tonight at 7 o’clock at the Racquet Club in Washington, with Dr. Walter L. Lingle, president of Davidson, as guest of honor. Dr. Lingle left Monday night for Washington to attend another meeting and this Davidson dinner was arranged to coincide with his visit to the national capital. Approximately 30 Davidson men are in Washington and vicinity. The president of the chapter is Harold C. Smith, ’14, of Rockville, Md. W. A. Elliott, ’09, and J. A. Thames, '18, both of Washington, are vice-president and secretary, respectively. At the suggestion of the secretary of the chapter, this meeting was arranged before the adjournment of Congress, in order to have Davidson’s three Congressmen and honorary Senator as guests. Hon. W. F. Stevenson, ’85, of South Carolina, and Hon. J. Bayard Clark, '05, and Hon. Hinton James, ’06, both North Carolina representatives, will probably attend tonight. Hon. Cameron Morrison, Senator from North Carolina, is an honorary alumnus of Davidson and has been extended a special invitation to attend. This has been the only meeting arranged for Dr. Lingle on this trip, since it is necessary that he return to Davidson immediately thereafter.

UNDERWEAR OF DISTINCTION
SHIRTS AND SHORTS

Some men say amusing things about color in shirts and shorts—but no one questions the unusual comfort in this two-piece underwear as made by HANES. We’ve taken track-athlete freedom and enlarged on it a bit for men who’ve dropped their calisthenics, but who love comfort none the less. We are a little tickled, too, that we can match the weird colors in your ties, your shirts, and your socks—though there is pure white, of course.
