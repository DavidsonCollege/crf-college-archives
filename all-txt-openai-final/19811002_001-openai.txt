Perimeter Housing  
by Anne Miano '85

Students living in perimeter housing are frustrated with the Housing Office.

Junior Natalie Kerr arrived at Grey House this summer to try to get things ready for the fall. She said the scene that greeted her was almost unbelievable. There was junk in the bedrooms and trash on the floor. There was food in the cabinets and in the refrigerator that had been there for months. The bathroom was so dirty and so full of mildew that Natalie was scared to even walk in the room. She felt compelled to run to the store, buy some cleaner, and scrub down the bathroom and bedroom before she would bring her things into the house. As a little added plus to an already filthy scene, fleas had moved into the shag carpet.

Natalie said that the ultimate moment came when “we made the mistake of pulling out the refrigerator.” The grime behind it had to be scraped up with a spatula.

The place looked as though no one had cleaned it all summer. From the upstairs carpet to the kitchen appliances, it was, as Natalie said, basically “gross.”

But one wouldn’t know it to see Grey House now. Natalie and some of the other Grey House residents had the curtains and chair covers cleaned and stripped the old wax off the kitchen floor. The girls said they had to stand on top of Housing Director Bill Bolding’s desk until someone from the College would repaint their walls. “If we hadn't gotten here early,” Nancy said, “we would have never had the time to get it done.”
