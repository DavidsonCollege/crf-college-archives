**Kruse’s Cubby: Seaman’s adventures**

By MICHAEL KRUSE
Assistant Sports Editor

Cleveland’s Jacobs Field. Last October. The playoffs. Chief Wahoo gruesomely tears his ACL in an awkward dive off the outfield
fence. Despite sporting crutches and a nasty brace, the melon-headed mascot makes an inspirational comeback at the World Series. This
is just one of many recent scenarios catapulting mascots into the national limelight.

Residing on tops of dugouts and sidelines from sea to shining sea, these fuzzy, lovable creatures are slowly making their
mark. ESPNet, in conjunction with the recent NCAA tournament insanity, conducted the National Collegiate Mascot Tournament. Webcrawlers had the chance
to pick their champion. The Syracuse Orangeman, like the institution which it represents, advanced far into the field. Not hard
to believe, considering the Orangeman is a television personality now, due to his recent role as punching bag/air traffic controller
in SportsCenter’s nutty ad campaign.

But everybody’s favorite citrus superstar is not the only mascot boldly venturing into the wide world of commercials. The Mariner
Moose has vaulted into the political arena as Ken Griffey Jr.’s running mate in Nike’s upcoming mock-presidential race. But the
careful observer has to ask, why is the Mariners’ fuzzy friend a Moose? Mariner. Moose? I think Seattle’s mascot should
be a crusty old sailor. Stubble. The unmistakable odor of salt, fish, and rum. Barnacles.

But the fun doesn’t have to stop there. He could be dubbed the Naughty Navigator. Or Seductive Sea Dog. Or
Sensual Seafarer. But my choice: Seaman. Plain and simple. And Seaman’s sidekick would be a cheap, peg-legged, lusty wench, Peg.
The possibilities for between-inning routines would be endless. And then there would be Cabin Boy, a notorious homefield advantage. The
scrawny, toothless, leprous dwarf would roam the visitor’s clubhouse, pestering, “Would you like to buy a monkey?”

Sure, the little tykes’ eyes light up when Saturday Night Fever Moose performs his dugout jig or when Rollerblade Moose
sacrifices his body for the team and hurtles himself into the fence. But none of that tops Seaman and Peg.
“Aargh. Your place or mine?” “Neither. Seventh inning stretch. Homeplate.”

**Rugby tackles Heels for upset victory**

Under a blazing sun and in front of a hostile Chapel Hill crowd on Saturday, the Davidson rugby team stunned
favorite North Carolina, 8-7, certainly its crowning achievement of the season. “They didn’t take us seriously, and we certainly made
them pay for that,” said Bob Yarbrough.

The Tarheels struck first, when they picked up a loose ball from a ruck deep in the Davidson half and
touched down for a try. The kick gave UNC an early 7-0 advantage. But the Davidson defense was nearly perfect
from then on. Keith Davis, Jason Allen, and Graham Powell put intense pressure on the backs, drilling several players into
the ground after they bobbled the ball, while Sean Harvey hooked well throughout, supplying solid defense in mauls and rucks.

Still, the inspired Wildcats could not capitalize on their opportunities, losing line-outs, failing to get the ball to the backs,
and faltering in the mauls. After the Wildcats controlled the flow of the game for most of the first half,
the second provided a challenge, as UNC substituted more than ten fresh players. Davidson’s fifteen responded, continuing their ferocious tackling.
Chris Williams and John Spainhour combined for several takedowns. The offense also improved their attack with deceptive back Josh Glazer.squad
grabbed its biggest win this year on Saturday, an 8-7 thriller at Chapel Hill. Plays and determined straight-ahead running. Warren
Buford’s kick coverage drove the opposition back, and Matt Burkhardt converted a kick deep on the sideline to put Davidson
on the board, 7-3. Davidson then played inspired rugby for the next twenty minutes. Frank Killian starred at fullback, contributing
two long runs deep into UNC territory. Craig Murphy and David Derrick hounded the Tarheel backs, while Mike Lassiter and
Thayer Long combined on a penalty run. Spainhour and Murphy began to connect on the line-outs, allowing the backs to
continue their push towards the try zone. With less than five minutes left, Hank Ackerman stepped to the forefront, providing
the game-winner. Receiving a pass out of a ruck, Ackerman advanced upfield, avoiding and outrunning would-be tacklers, and finally diving
in with two men on his back. Thanks to several huge defensive stands in the final minute, the Wildcats escaped
Tarheel country with the stunning victory.

Although Ackerman and the offense struck for the decisive blow, the Davidson “D” were the consensus primetime performers. “We contained
them all afternoon. They never broke a long run on us,” said coach Paul Kenney, obviously ecstatic about the outcome.
“All of UNC’s international experience didn’t count for squat after we came out and showed them we knew how to
hit,” added coach Blaine Segal. The squad, now at 5-1 overall, plays their final game on Saturday on the IMAC
field versus St. Andrews.

Baseball drops five after big win over Duke

The Wildcats continued their roller-coaster season recently, claiming an upset win over the 22nd-ranked Duke Blue Devils on Apr. 3,
only to drop five straight, four by a single run, to fall to 11-25. The apparent confidence-builder in Durham quickly
turned sour, as Davidson dropped all three games of an Easter weekend series with Marshall in Huntington, W. Va. Marshall
rallied for two unearned runs to pull out a 5-4 victory in the bottom of the ninth in the first
game and then took the second on a game-winning solo homer in extra innings, despite a strong Chris Pollard pitching
performance.

Davidson led throughout in the series finale, holding a three-run lead in the bottom of the ninth. With the bases
loaded and one out, Mordecai Stolk replaced starter Rhett Ingerick and surrendered a two-run double. The tying and winning runs
came in two batters later, rounding out perhaps the most heartbreaking weekend of this year’s generally heartbreaking campaign. A masterful
effort on the mound by senior captain Jeff Andrews and a three-run Wildcat third went for naught on Tuesday, as
the 18th-ranked N.C. State Wolfpack prevailed in Raleigh, 4-3.

After a week of tight, well-played contests, Thursday’s sloppy slugfest with App. St. represented a stark contrast. In a game
that featured twenty-six runs on twenty-six hits and eight errors, the Mountaineers bettered the Wildcats, 14-12. Rhett Ingerick, 3rd on
the team in batting average at .292, notched his fifth triple last week, a Davidson season record. The team has
14 triples, another record. Luke Goodwin leads the team in hitting at a .339 clip, Gus Quattlebaum leads in homers
with 8, and Brad Edwards is tied with Andersen Marvin for a team-best 29 RBI.
