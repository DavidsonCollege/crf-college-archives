C. Eric Lincoln began: “Consider this: We live in the world’s greatest democracy. We are the world’s most advanced humanitarian society; our nation is the world’s most renowned and effective citadel of freedom. We are all colors, all creeds, all races, all nationalities, by descent or derivation. We are Americans, the people of the dream. This is about that dream and what we must do to achieve it.”

Lincoln, professor of religion and culture at Duke University, was guest speaker at Wednesday’s Open Luncheon in the 900 Room. Lincoln’s speech, entitled “The Seam of the Dream: Where do we Go From Here?” is only one of several events that make up the Martin Luther King, Jr. Black History Month Cultural Arts Series.

Lincoln addressed the American paradox. He said Americans are a proud group not given to admissions of failure or self-doubt. “This makes us the victims of a paradox, for the more loudly we proclaim our perfection, the more insistent seems to be the need for corroboration from significant others,” Lincoln said.

But even when Americans are given criticism, such criticism is not put to use. It is at this point that the dilemma arises, Lincoln said. He said that Gunnar Myrdal, a Swedish social scientist, said about America:

“America had a dilemma, and the dilemma derived from the conflict between the high-sounding Christian precepts embodied in the American self-image as compared to the way Americans really behave.”

The dilemma Myrdal described was not new nor has it been alleviated. It existed when the first American settlers exploited other humans for advancement and it is still perpetuated today.

Lincoln said that current racism is not all that troubles America. According to him, the dilemma represents “a critical cluster of social and moral problems which, because of their institutionalization, have gained an aura of spurious innocence and a wide spectrum of tacit social approval.”

General acquiescence makes almost futile the laws which have been used to fight racism, he said.

Furthermore, Lincoln said that America’s high sense of materialism has resulted in the disregard of God and society. “Is our society more concerned with the glitter of Gucci to sport in the mall than it is with the thousands of homeless who live in the sewers?” he asked.

Lincoln compared America’s promises of liberty and opportunity to its status as the world’s largest importer of illegal drugs. He suggested that the dream has gone sour as citizens realize America’s “unparalleled reality.” Prejudice defines the American dilemma, for it infects every aspect of our real America.

**Getting inside Dean Rusk’s head**

Editor of Rusk’s autobiography discusses the man for his 80th birthday

By SHARON LEE SCHWARTZ

Why did former Secretary of State Dean Rusk make the decisions he did during his long diplomatic career? Daniel Papp, editor of Rusk’s upcoming autobiography, attempted to answer that question when he spoke January 26 at Eumenean Hall.

Papp is professor of international affairs and director of the School of Social Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Rusk, Secretary of State under Kennedy and Johnson, is a 1931 graduate of Davidson.

Papp began his lecture by identifying the factors which often influence policy-making. Rusk’s understanding of history and his personal experiences were especially noted.

According to Papp, Rusk’s historical concepts grew out of events related to World War II. Rusk viewed pacifism, isolationism and public indifference as culprits of the conflict. It is due to these factors that expansionist states provided the catalyst for the war.

Rusk’s memoirs reveal he is convinced that collective security, that is, multinational efforts to provide aid to a state attacked by another—a type of check system—has successfully deterred a third world war. Furthermore, this collective security is the responsibility of Western governments, said Papp.

Certain events in Rusk’s life left a lasting impression upon him, says Papp. For example, recurring racial violence in open contradiction to the American creed and in derogation of the American Dream.

Lincoln said the abuse of power in American society is felt most painfully by the poor. President Bush will be more sensitive to minority issues, he said.

Lincoln is confident that in spite of our failings, we still have a dream. “And it is that the American Dream will come true for all Americans,” he said.

“The reality of the American Dream for all Americans is in your hands. The dream is in your hands. You are the future that has come. You are the tomorrow that is here. What will you do?”
