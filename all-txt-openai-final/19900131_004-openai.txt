**Mid-winter celebrations in 60-70 degrees? What's a poor freshman to make of this mysterious holiday?**

By LIZ DAVIDSON

Sometimes it’s hard being a freshman here at Davidson. People never tell you anything or else everyone tells you something different. Obtaining information from people is confusing, frustrating, and sometimes downright embarrassing. We freshmen sit around a lot, just trying to figure things out. For instance, why were we the only ones dressed up for the first home football game? Where do all the sophomore girls go Friday and Saturday nights? (We never see them at parties). We never really learn anything until we’ve experienced it ourselves. For example, maybe it’s not a good idea to stand straddling the sides of the stairway at PiKA—you could fall. Or the guy that walks us back to our room at 3:30 a.m., when the parties have all ended, isn’t interested in the decor of our rooms—believe me, he already knows.

Likewise, Midwinters was something we all had to learn about. It all started out as a big mystery. The questions were endless. Would we have to dress up? Would the parties be closed or open? Would they conflict with The Indigo Girls concert? No one seemed to have any idea. Plans were made at the last minute, if they were made at all.

“I thought the Sig-Ep formal was Friday night, but it was Saturday. I was almost ready to go Friday when I found out,” freshman Dair Brown told me, laughing.

At PiKA, there seemed to be even more confusion. “I had no idea what to wear, what we were doing, what time to go, what to expect, period,” freshman Jane Mount confessed. The party Friday night was a Mexican theme, and no one seemed to know if they should wear sombreros and baja rugs or the more traditional coat and tie and cocktail dresses.

**What Happened**

It was a confusing weekend. Some dates were separated and future ones were made. Some of us woke up in places we had never seen before. Others got to bed before 12 a.m. The bands were great or lousy, depending on where you were. The houses seemed emptier than I had expected, and I kept wondering where everyone had gone. However, beer was plentiful, and there seemed to be few complaints. In general, nothing went as planned, maybe because very little was planned. Most students, however, seemed to have had fun. That was the general consensus of the freshmen I interviewed. I wonder if we will be better prepared next year. What will we tell the freshmen? Those of us who remember the night will have 10,000 different things to say, and the confusion will start all over again.

**INDIGO, from page 1**

...ory and our subconscious is tied up in all that. It’s not a Christian ideal though, it’s a spiritual one.” Indigo Girls’ basic message, said Ray, is “self-esteem. Learn to believe in yourself and everything else will fall into place.” Other recurring...Themes in their songs are “self-awareness and knowledge.” Ray said their music advocates increased emphasis on inner-self education and cultural, political, and environmental awareness. Ray and Saliers’ musical personalities create a stunning duet in part because of their complementary styles. “We're really different from one another,” said Ray. “I’m the more emotional, to-the-punch type. Emily’s a little more grounded.”

Ray continued, “I was always the manager early on. Emily was the one who taught me harmonies.” However, both women “are involved in all aspects” of their music. “We got help from other people when it [their success] got too big to handle,” said Ray.

One of the basic requirements of life as a musician is lots of road travel. Playing the club circuit is essential in achieving name recognition. Ray professed to “like that circuit a lot. People are sitting right in your face. If you have a good show, you know it was good. If you have a bad show, you know it was bad. It’s a very honest, bare-bones situation.” “Theaters are a great place for ballads,” said Ray, while “concert settings can give you a raw, emotional edge.” She said that she and Saliers enjoy both kinds of settings: “We vary with what we're in the mood to play.”

Ray and Saliers enjoy living on the road. “It’s not as hard as having to go to work at 9:00 a.m. We're lucky that we don’t have to do that!” The precarious life of a musician does not frighten Ray. “It doesn’t scare me at all. I don’t really care. I could get a job at Pizza Hut if I had to. We feel really lucky because we're healthy and have at least average minds.” Money is not a priority with the group. “Happiness is our only priority,” said Ray. However, continuing to produce good music is another major priority of the Indigo Girls. “We just want to make albums and be satisfied with each one,” said Ray.

The band’s third LP should be released this September, and Ray and Saliers plan to work on it this summer in Los Angeles and Athens, Georgia. They will again enlist the aid of Scott Litt, who produced their last album and who has also worked with R.E.M. When Indigo Girls tour again this fall, they will seek to expand their target audience. “College kids are the largest percentage of our fans,” admitted Ray. “They’re our peer group.” However, she said, “We’d like to have some more high school kids and older people” listening to the group’s sounds.

Ray had some advice for young fans who want to do more than just listen to music. Aspiring musicians should “try to get into a studio as soon as possible. Do a record, do everything you can do on an independent level. If you understand the process, people won't take away your spirit.” Although Ray freely acknowledged that breaking into the music business is difficult, she said, “Just believe in the music. There’s lots of negative things that can happen inside you. They can be channeled into positive things.”
