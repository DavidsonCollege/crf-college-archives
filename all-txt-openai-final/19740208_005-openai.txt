Five The Davidsonian

February 8, 1974

Come grow with our bank!
We're C&S, the second fastest growing major bank in the country. And we plan to quadruple in size during this decade. We're the kind of bank that early overcame the stuffy, conservative image held by banks in general. The reason for the difference is the kind of people who've built C&S: a new breed of bankers who had the imagination to think of new things to do, new ways to do the old things, and the courage to try them.

But what does all of this have to do with you? Perhaps a lotâ€”if you choose to join Banking's New Breed and come grow with us!
Stop by your school placement office. We will be on your campus soon.
