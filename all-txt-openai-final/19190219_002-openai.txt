Baseball—and nine letter men back! Watch the coming season.

We might at least do honor to Washington by having a holiday on his birthday.

Eighteen more days, Juniors. We feel for you.

The man who predicted that the R. O. T. C. would start up March 1, was about right.

There are still some men who persist in cutting up the campus by ugly little paths.

**College Spirit**

Davidson men have probably as much college spirit as students of any other institution, and yet is this spirit what
it used to be or what it should be? Decline or rise in pep is often difficult to explain, many
attributing the former to lack of class spirit, owing to the fact that except for the name there are no
distinctions to speak of between any two of the four classes. There are no inter-class competitions or contests, which would
tend to stimulate rivalry and foster class pep. One class is on practically an even footing with another, so that
the student body resembles, to a certain extent, one large class rather than four. Each class is supposed to have
colors and a yell, but the majority of the men have no idea what they are. They sit apart in
chapel and church, and upperclassmen take more advanced studies and hold more offices, but except for this there is practically
no distinction between them.

It is a pretty well-accepted belief that class spirit has been declining on the campus and is now pretty well
extinct. And some think that this lack of class spirit will injure or weaken the college spirit. The precedent of
class spirit would have to grow up gradually and would require concerted action. The whole thing is a question which
deserves fair thought.

As to college spirit, it has been suggested that it could better be kept up by establishing customs which would
have a certain degree of formality and dignity. Such suggestions are often received with derision by the average college boy
but a fair trial will not prove them altogether impracticable. One thing mentioned is to have a distinctive Davidson song,
so that when it is played or sung, every Davidson man will stand at attention with head uncovered, in the
same way in which he shows his respect for The Star-Spangled Banner. Fellows, see if this is not an idea
that improves on acquaintance. A number of other such customs might be suggested, and The Davidsonian will be only too
glad to publish articles discussing such questions, if anyone will be so inclined to set his thoughts down on paper.

**Keep Behind the Team**

The best spirit a student body can show is to take victory and defeat with a grin—to refrain from boasting
and “crowing” in the first place, and to keep cheerful and cut out excuses in the second. Such a spirit
is rare, and the student body that has it, makes an enviable rep for its college. No excuses or explanations
are necessary for the defeats suffered on the recent basketball trip through the state and into Virginia. We know every
man on the squad did his best and put up a game fight; and in the main that’s why a
student body should back its team to the limit—and that’s why it does. Davidson will get far more credit by
taking its medicine cheerfully than to have won every game on the trip. Nor is there any reason for the
team to become disheartened. The student body of course wants it to win; but in either case it is right
behind the team and will back it all the way through the season.

**Ministerial Band Feed is Well Attended**

On last Saturday night the members of the Ministerial Band had a very enjoyable “feed.” Promptly at 10 o'clock the
door of the upper right-hand room of the “Y” opened and the members of the band had the pleasure of
looking upon a long table covered with a great quantity and variety of food.of “eats.” All took seats while Currie,
the President of the Band, made a few remarks on the purpose of the Band, the responsibility resting upon it,
and what part it should play in the coming campaign. Immediately after this, the fellows proceeded to make way with
the “eats.” Though there was an abundant supply of everything, it lasted but a very few minutes with the thirty-one
men present. Following this was an hour of joke-telling by those disposed to do so, and also by some not
disposed to. Some great ones were told. The “dog” goes to Matthews, Cumming, Dendy, and McClov. At a late hour,
after giving a few yells, everyone left feeling that the occasion had been a great success. The “Band” expressed its
appreciation to Harrell and McGirt for the good work they did in purchasing and spreading the “eats.”

RUMPLE STILL LEADS IN BIBLE CLASSES

The attendance at the morning Bible classes last Sunday registered 112, this number being divided as follows: North Wing Chambers,
16; South Wing Chambers, 24; Georgia, 14; Watts, 25; and Rumple, 33. Rumple again led with the best average, having
33 men present out of a possible 50. The attendance shows a slight decrease from that of the preceding Sunday,
this probably being due to the fact that quite a number of fellows spent the weekend off the Hill. Miss
Flora McNair and Miss E. Mills were visitors on the Hill last Saturday.

FRESH-SOPH DEBATE SCHEDULED FOR MARCH 17

Gentlemen! The preliminaries for the Fresh-Soph debate will be held in the society halls on Monday, March 17, at which
time the Fresh-Soph team will be selected to represent their respective societies in the final debate on March 31. Last
year was the first time this contest was held between the societies. It created much interest and gave the members
of the two lower classes a means of settling an argument which they usually carry on the whole year. So
this year the Eumenean Soph and Fresh are out for revenge, which will bring out large numbers in the Philanthropic.
The subject for the preliminaries and final is, “Resolved, That all able-bodied men in the United States should be compelled
to take one year of military training before they are twenty-one years old.” After the final debate, the judges will
decide which society has the strongest team and who is the best debater on each team, to whom will be
awarded the debater’s medal by their societies. So Freshmen and Sophomores, get to work, show the other fellows that you
can debate. Remember it is only four weeks off, and there is no time to lose.

TENNIS AND TRACK MEET PLANS UNDER WAY

“Bob” Cunningham, the manager, has some interesting schedules planned for those who are followers of the ball and racquet. A
tournament has been arranged for the first week in March. A good deal of interest has been shown all through
the term in this particular sport and it is hoped that even more will be brought out in the next
month. Captain McQueen, of the fleet-footed crew, has been watching the weather with rather a dubious eye for the last
week, but regardless of the present conditions, the track is soon to be in shape to accommodate all those who
have any desire to become members of the track squad. Several meets have been planned for the spring season. One
will be an inter-class contest from which most likely the Varsity will be chosen. There will be a state meet
later in the spring which will be followed by a meet at Georgia Tech. There are quite a number of
men in college who ought to set some new records and put Davidson first on the list in this line.
If you can’t run, try jumping; if not that, throw the weights. And if none of these are in your
line, come out and get some exercise.

“Guy” Humphries, ‘18, has been discharged from the Marine Corps and expects to enter college again.
