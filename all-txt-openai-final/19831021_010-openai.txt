**The Value Of Teaching**

As the list of articles, papers, and books published by Davidson faculty members grows, the College and its professors will face the problem of research time conflicting with teaching commitments.

Davidson is not a research university, and it never should become one. At the same time, however, the increase in faculty interest in publishing over the last ten years should not go unnoticed. Faculty members who actively engage in research in their disciplines constantly add to their expertise and at the same time build the College’s national reputation as an academic institution.

Despite this increasing importance of research, the College’s Statement of Purpose dwells more on the value of teaching than research. “It is vital that all students, freshmen as well as upperclassmen, know and study under mature and scholarly teachers who are able and eager to provide for each of them stimulus, instruction and guidance,” it reads. In fact, the College often refers to personal contact with professors as one of Davidson’s biggest advantages over many other schools. Since this is the College’s Statement of Purpose, the College should be careful to preserve it.

Many of Davidson’s senior faculty members are products of a time when the pressure to publish was not as great. For many of these professors, teaching is and has been by far the focus of their work. What will happen, though, when today’s junior professors become the elder statesmen of Davidson? Will they stop research, or will they bring a different philosophy of education with them? For example, if the attitude spreads that availability to students is unnecessary, students would stand only to lose from this change.

These are questions which future Davidson students will need to consider more carefully than today’s students do. It will become more and more important for professors and the Administration to come to an agreement about balancing teaching and publishing responsibilities. The growth of interest in publishing is exciting, surely, but it can extend only a certain amount before it impinges on the Statement of Purpose’s emphasis on teaching.

Finally, the tenure-track junior professors who constitute the most active publishers here need to consider very carefully where their commitments rest. Research institutions exist for research professors; teaching institutions exist for teaching professors. Given Davidson’s historical lack of receptivity toward change, any attempt to alter Davidson’s emphasis on teaching will probably meet with resistance; the more ambitious publishers here should recognize the College’s faith in the value of teaching.

**LETTERS**

**Oral Encouragement**

To the Editor:  
The Patterson Court Committee on Self-selection, acting with the support of the Dean of Students, has decided that the distribution of oral encouragements to freshmen before the start of winter term shall be a violation of the principle of self-selection. The committee decided to do this principally because premature oral encouragements tend to limit the freshmen’s experience of all the opportunities the Court has to offer and subsequently could affect his/her choice of a house.

**Letters Policy**

The Davidsonian welcomes letters from its readers. We try to print all letters of general interest, but we adhere to these four guidelines:  
1) We require that letters be in our hands by 7 p.m. Tuesday.  
2) We require that letters be neatly typed.  
3) We require that letters be signed and include the author’s phone number and address. If you have a compelling reason for us to withhold your name, explain your situation to the editors.  
4) We reserve the right not to print letters that:  
a) function as advertisements;  
b) contain innuendo, off-color slurs, or inside jokes;  
c) represent a viewpoint very similar to that expressed in other letters printed on the same topic.
