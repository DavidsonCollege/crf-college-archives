**Class of the millennium: ’00 descends on**

By RANDY HARTWELL
Associate News Editor

For their first Davidson examination, incoming freshmen were asked to juggle. Dean of Students Tom Shandley noted the irony in
his midday welcome in Love Auditorium Thursday, but dispelled any expectations of future tests and reassured both students and their
parents of the rigor of a Davidson education. “It gets better,” he said.

Nancy Cable, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid, also spoke to this year’s freshmen class, proudly citing its dimensions and
accomplishments. This fall, freshmen hail from 38 states. Three come from Alaska, one from Arizona, and the California contingent is
the largest in the College’s history. Forty-six students were ranked number one in their high school classes, and the Admissions
Office estimates that 50 were number one or two in schools which don’t rank their students. Twenty-six were salutatorians, and
approximately 80% of entering freshmen were in the top 10% of their classes.

In the class of 2000, one student was a national crew champion, rowing in two different boats. One has performed
1000 hours of community service. Another led a community program to fight hunger, making 100 lunches for needy children every
morning before school. One freshman monitored Internet-integrity in the Midwest, while one wrote an original play for public television. One
has directed a national town meeting, and another chaired a metropolitan DC area AIDS conference. One student has begun interviewing
all living World War I veterans, a project already earmarked for federal funding.

Cable told the standing-room-only crowd that “you have seized opportunities... and we look forward to your bringing all those talents
to bear for us at Davidson College.” Shandley echoed her warmly, “You have never been inside [Davidson] before. Now you
are. I hope it feels good.”

**Computer center moves to Belk dorm**

By MARY CLARE JALONICK
Executive Editor

Computer center die-hards who head to their “home away from home” across Main Street this year will soon find that
the User Services Building is not quite what they remember it to be. Staff have taken the building over completely,
and the computer lab has moved to the most unlikely of places — Belk dorm. A Physical Plant shop —
and an old ROTC firing range — has been converted to hold the campus computer lab. The new center boasts
a greater number of computers than the old USB, as well as upgraded models.

The move was due to an “office crunch,” according to John Casey, Executive Director of Information Technology. Two positions were
added to the staff, so the school decided to renovate the Basement Belk area to hold the computer lab. “We’ve
put the lab closer to the center of student life,” he says. The area is around the same size as
the old computer lab. The new lab has 45 machines, roughly the same amount as the USB. However, all of
the Windows machines have been updated, and there are now an equal amount of Macintosh and Windows units. Macintosh Word
Perfect has been upgraded from 3.1 to 3.5; Word Perfect for Windows has been upgraded from 6.0 to 6.1. The

For the Student Computing Center, the entrance will be the same. Students can enter the lab only from an entrance
adjacent to the laundry parking lot; it is not accessible from inside the dorm.

Other services on campus are getting a jumpstart on Davidson. If the Class of 2000 hasn’t yet acclimated to Davidson,
it won’t be the fault of 1996 Orientation efforts. Associate Dean of Students Leslie Marsicano, who headed the program, and
her staff worked for months preparing for the four-day event. Marsicano said the new and improved orientation “was a success”
mostly thanks to the added innovation of an Orientation Team (OT). One hundred upperclass students participated after returning to campus
on August 18 to assist in readying for the arrival of freshmen. Team members performed jobs such as photocopying syllabi,
moving in new students, and leading book discussions—all the while sporting custom-made Orientation Team baseball hats. Freshmen seemed to appreciate
them as they took part in such activities as a reggae band concert and the Class of 2000 Olympics, which
Erica Thorsen, ‘00, said “was rad! Second Rich won!” Andrew Griswold said he felt oriented as well. “I got to
carry couches for Habitat, so I know where all the dorms are now.” One new feature of orientation was the
performance of scenes from "Living on the Color Line," required reading for all freshmen.

SGA votes to charter IVCF

By Kirsten Recknagel, News Editor

In a move that escaped notice late last spring, the Student Government Association (SGA) reversed its controversial decision not to
renew Intervarsity Christian Fellowship’s (IVCF) charter. On April 30, the Senate granted IVCF a charter by a vote of 18
for, 12 against, and 3 abstentions. A week earlier, voting 16-15, Senators denied IVCF’s request for charter renewal, citing recent
amendments to IVCF’s constitution which some Senate members felt violated Davidson’s non-discrimination policy. Specifically, changes included in IVCF’s constitution last
year stated that individuals should demonstrate lives "... free of ... sexual immorality, including the practice of homosexuality, or the
inappropriate practice of heterosexual activity outside of the marriage context ..." (Article V, Section 1). IVCF appealed the Senate’s initial
vote, requesting that members of the SGA reconsider their previous decision. The appeal read, in part, "... the authority to
interpret College policies lies, ultimately, with the Dean of Students and the President of the College. The amendments to the
IVCF Constitution were made at the request of the Dean of Students, with the knowledge of the President.” Until last
year, no specific mention of homosexuality was included in the constitution.

Freshmen and their parents enjoy a tasty but toasty lunch on Chambers lawn Thursday just after registration.
