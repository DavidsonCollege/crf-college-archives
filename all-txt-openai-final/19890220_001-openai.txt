When Charlotte-Mecklenburg public teachers walked out of the classrooms Tuesday to demonstrate for a pay increase in Raleigh, the state
capital, they left many students behind. The district education office only had 900 substitute teachers eligible to fill 1,200 February
14 vacancies. Frantic, the office called upon the community to help.

Several Davidson College professors responded to the need. Without being asked by the education office, professor of mathematics R. Bruce
Jackson called to volunteer the services of certain college staff as substitute teachers.

Myra Joines at the education office quickly accepted the offer. “We are so pleased because of their interest and high
credentials,” she said.

Professors secured permission to take personal leave days from Dean of Faculty Robert Williams. Williams approved all requests. Participating faculty
also sent a letter to Governor James Martin, a Davidson graduate and a former chemistry teacher, asking for support.

As members of the teaching profession, professors such as Bob Manning of the department of physics and Hansford Epes of
the German department felt obliged to lend their support.

“I have a very great professional and personal interest in the demonstration,” said English professor Randy Nelson. “Support for the
community is important,” he added.

Charlotte-Mecklenburg teachers are presently paid on an experience-based salary scale which has not been altered for a number of years.
Senior teachers thus receive the same salary as beginning teachers.

The decision to protest resulted in reaction to remarks made by Governor Martin three weeks ago.

Martin stated that due to inadequate revenues, teachers might have to wait until April 1990 for the state to fund
its long-promised salary increase. The announcement sparked an uproar among teachers, many of whom organized to protest.

In Raleigh, teachers hoped to impress state legislators in favor of the pay raises. Legislature will ultimately decide whether to
fund the pay schedule immediately or to wait for a year.

When the school board met with legislators on Monday, February 13, they received a lot of support. Because of this
hopeful meeting, the teachers went to Raleigh with high hopes. They were supported by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg administrators, who promise to
initiate a raise upon approval from the state.

Both parents and students are also aware of the problem, according to Ken Roberts, principal of North Mecklenburg High School.
He added that he, along with many people throughout the district, look on with pleasant surprise at the amount of
support the teachers have received.

Over the past two months VCRs have been stolen from Spencer House, Kappa Sigma, Sigma Phi Epsilon, and Perkins Auditorium
in Chambers. Also, others have been reported stolen from rooms in Belk, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and Kappa Alpha.

On Friday night of Midwinters, someone entered Spencer House after 1 a.m. and stole the VCR by entering through the
basement window and taking off the front piece of a wall. Junior Amy Herndon, Spencer House manager, said that the
thieves were “polite thieves” since they took the rented movie out of the VCR and left the other rented movie
also.

Spencer House had been locked up by the police, as it is every night around 1 a.m.; however, the windows
do not lock. Spencer is now taking new security measures to add windows that will lock.

Senior Ash Ahsanuddin, Sig Ep’s house and grounds manager and last week’s Davidsonian cover boy, reported that the VCR was
stolen from Sig Ep three to four weeks ago. Although the Sig Ep house is not usually locked, the closet
containing the VCR is always locked.
