**New Center Seeks United Community**

The Davidson Community Center has one central purpose: to fulfill “significant community needs that can be met with a modest amount of money from the town by having a facility of this sort and its programs,” according to Randall Kincaid, chairman of the Park and Recreation Committee of Davidson. “The key word in that rationale is need,” Kincaid explained. “The people of the town felt that there are needs which can be met by this sort of operation. That is why we brought the community center into existence.”

The Center is located in the old Ada Jenkins School building, the one-time black school in Davidson which was closed when the integration policy began in the South. Saunie Wood, the director of the community center, outlined several aspects of the project that make it so important. “One really important point about our project is that the County Extension Services in North Carolina have never placed a member of its staff in one particular area to try to analyze the needs of the community and develop programs to meet these needs to the extent that we are. We are fortunate to have Julia McCullum from the Mecklenburg County Extension office working full-time for us,” Wood explained. “I am excited about the program because I feel there is so much to be done and we have the resources and the desire to do them.”

Many of the programs being put into effect through Ada Jenkins are new to the area, both in scope and ideal. One is the Hot Meals Program which provides elderly persons with free lunchtime meals on Mondays and Tuesdays. Kincaid explained some of the economic aspects of this particular project. “At the present time we are receiving funds from the government as well as support from the local churches. We would like to expand the program to include all five weekdays, which would mean an additional sum of money, naturally. Those who eat with this program pay what they can afford on a contributory basis,” Kincaid also noted that over fifty people take advantage of this offer at the present time.

The one program with which students may be most familiar is the Schoolhouse of the Arts. Kincaid referred to this effort as “a first-class effort” and Wood indicated that it is still considered an experimental project. Kincaid and Wood agree that it is turning out better than was expected. Classes are offered in drama by Constance Welsh, painting by Laura Jackson, dance and creative movement by Kista Tucker, and Orff music by Rosemary Klein. Kincaid was especially pleased with the progress of the arts program. He praised those who were offering their time to contribute to this cause, claiming them as “first-class instructors” in the arts. These classes and lessons are taught on an ability-to-pay basis, which means a student pays only as much as he is able. Nancy Hazel is the coordinator for the arts programs.

Recreation is also an integral part of any community facility. The center has just hired a full-time director for recreation in Marcus Rivens. Rivens has long been active in community affairs, especially regarding recreation. Wood was especially excited about Riven's appointment, as it will facilitate the beginning of the after-school recreation programs which the center hopes to start in the coming weeks. The center is looking for an assistant for Rivens. The job will require a time commitment of around 12 hours per week, mainly consumed between the hours of 1:45 p.m. and 4:30 p.m. on Monday through Thursday each week. The job will pay $2.52 an hour.

The recreation program will begin with supervised activities for elementary, junior high, and high school students at separate times each afternoon and evening. The facilities of the center are very well equipped to handle this sort of activity, since there is a gymnasium in very good condition. Both Wood and Kincaid expressed the need and anticipation of student help through volunteer services, especially in the area of after-school recreation. The College YM/YWCA is expected to provide help as they did.Last spring when the program was getting under way, Kincaid looked for a spirit of cooperation between these two groups whose common interest is community service, as well as with the North Mecklenburg Y. One of the ways in which the center is making an effort towards this cooperation is by not supervising any organized, competitive sports. “This is something that the North Mecklenburg Y has been doing, and we do not want to interfere with their work,” Kincaid explained. “We will, however, make our facilities available for them.” He also pointed out that the gym was open for rent to any group for a dance or the like for $10 per hour. Classrooms are available for $2.50 per hour. But if the meeting is open to the public, they are free. Central Piedmont Community College is offering extension courses, eight in all, at the center. Kincaid was very happy about this effort because it will enhance the educational value of the center to the community. “The instructors that they are sending provide us with aid that would amount to about $8000 in monetary figures every year,” Kincaid noted. “That sure is a good deal of help.”

Kincaid went on to explain the basic financial structure involved with this venture. “We get $18,000 from the town out of their Revenue Sharing Funds, a $3000 grant for the arts program from the N.C. Arts Council to amount to an additional $40,000,” he said. “This means we have close to a $61,500 operation, which certainly is not bad for a town the size of Davidson.” A final area of interest is the help provided by the Legal Aid Services in Charlotte. This will entail sending a lawyer to the center one day each week to help disadvantaged people with legal problems. Both Kincaid and Wood were very excited about this phase of the center operations. The legal service would be funded to a large extent by the federal government.

The two also expressed the dire need for volunteers to help in the development of the program. “We need students to fill just about as many positions as anyone could imagine,” Kincaid explained. “I certainly look for many Davidson students to get involved in this program.”

According to a story published in the Oct. 9 issue of “The Mecklenburg Gazette,” all of the Davidson College-owned housing passed inspection by officials making a report issued by the Town of Davidson. College President Samuel R. Spencer Jr. released a statement this week indicating that although paint and minor repairs are needed, none of the college-owned units are substandard. Business Manager Robert A. Currie has indicated that all college housing was at least up to livable standards. Currie reiterated that the college has a policy against renting substandard housing. “The inspection report from the town states that although paint and minor repairs are needed, none of the units rented by the college are in violation of town laws or codes,” said Spencer. There are no town housing laws or codes. Davidson Mayor Tom Sadler indicated that town standards are based on state and county standards. The North Carolina Legislature has passed statute 160A-441 which both enables and encourages towns and cities to pass their own codes “above and beyond the state guidelines.”

By Charlotte standards, the housing owned by Davidson College in black Davidson is substandard. Three of the housing units mentioned in the Sept. 27 DAVIDSONIAN article have been pulled down. The issue was crystallized at this week’s Student Government Association Senate meeting. There, a resolution directed at both the college and the town was passed by a vote of 19-4-1. The resolution deplored the current housing situation and called on the college and the town to make reports explaining their positions. The SGA Senate also asked that a housing code for the Town of Davidson be adopted and enforced. The text of the SGA Senate resolution appears on page 12 of this issue. The Senate confronted the housing issue by calling on the one hand for the college to move above any superficial code in law books to a level of Christian decency, and by imploring the Town Council to adopt a housing code that will protect all citizens of Davidson.
