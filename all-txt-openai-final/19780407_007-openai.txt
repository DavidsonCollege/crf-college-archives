7. Members enumerate broad responsibilities to see us take an active role. In the past, breaking down the nation to
the collegiate level, considerations are thought of when spring football practice is scheduled. Much of the discussion in the ACIA
has led to the Athletic Department's revision of its Policy Book which, according to Stroud, defines “standard operating procedures.” ACIA
member and Professor of Economics Richard Avinger describes this revision as “filling in the gaps.” As S.P.C.A. President, the Committee
members uphold the low profile. Professor of one of the lines, we attempt to make the lines, we attempt to

is a "narrow focus you lose a lot of the importance of your decisions." During the two years of its
existence, the bulk of the CCRL’s activities have been concerned with Patterson Court. Last year, the Council worked on deciding
which group would receive the vacant house on Patterson Court, eventually deciding on those who wished to establish Rusk House.
This year, the CCRL’s activities have been almost completely dominated by the issue of self-selection. Council member Phil Gladden ’78
recalls it as a time of "much tension." Carroll, who served as the head of the subcommittee on Patterson Court,
described it as "trying to create a system that would be fair to everyone." The self-selection system recommended by the
CCRL went into operation this year. As a follow-up to this, the CCRL has recommended the formation of a "Supervisory
Committee for Self-Selection" which will hear complaints from freshmen or houses on violations of the rules for self-selection. The committee
will be composed of five members—four house presidents, two of which shall be fraternity members, and one of the Freshman
Advisors.

The real "test of it (CCRL) is coming up," according to Darbyshire. After having spent so much time on Patterson
Court issues, the Council will now move on to other areas. Issues that will be coming up in the near
future include a "concrete investigation on the quality of campus life and Christian commitment" and campus security, stated Chairman of
the CCRL and Dean of Students, Will H. Terry. Despite being termed by Darbyshire "the most active of the councils
on campus," many, like council member Cathy Howard ’79, feel that the CCRL has "a lot more potential than it
is showing now." Darbyshire believes that part of the problem is that the Council is "not as efficient as it
could be." Darbyshire notes that the CCRL is the "most important council as far as issues are concerned." Howard sees
the CCRL as a "sounding board for the students." Terry adds that the "council provides the best forum for pulling
all elements of the campus together to deal with problems and issues and, hopefully, goals for improving the quality of
campus life."

Committees bogged by structure
By PAM CAMERRA
Acting Editor

The Davidson College Advisory Councils have failed to meet the goals set out for them in the 1976 College Constitution.
Whereas the Councils were designed to guarantee broad-based input into the administrative policy-making, the Councils have proven to be only
sporadically effective in affording students and faculty the opportunity to influence decisions which affect College policy.

The first problem is a basic one: some of the Councils have simply failed to attend to their duties. The
Council on Admissions and Financial Aid has met only once this year. Second, the structure of the Councils hinders meaningful
input from their members. The chairman of each Council holds a near-monopoly on the information available to the Council. It
is deceptive to say that all members of any Council are co-equal in the decision-making process when the Council meets
so irregularly and only the chairman has access to all the information.

Third, the scope of responsibility of at least one of the Councils is too broad. Matters of Finance, Personnel, and
Development should not be gathered under one Council. It is foolish to think that a single Council which meets infrequently
can possibly keep track of so vast and complex an area. The 1976 Constitution implemented a separation of financial/development and
personnel concerns within the realm of the administration and those concerns should be divided and placed under the auspices of
separate Advisory Councils.

Revision of the Councils’ structure and clarification of their responsibilities is essential. The Councils must meet more frequently, ideally two
or three times a term. More frequent meetings in which the chairman shares his information will give each Council member
a more effective voice. Although Council members might argue that meeting more often would drain their time, the governance of
the College community is a serious responsibility and an important aspect of a college education. Decisions concerning the makeup of
the student body and faculty and the allocation of the budget, for example, affect all students and faculty. Part of
the educational process is learning to deal with people and becoming aware of and taking an active role in the
decision-making process of the community.

Because its concerns are more pressing, the Advisory Council on Campus and Religious Life (CCRL) has done a commendable job
this year. They have met more frequently than the other Councils and have taken the responsibility to act in matters
concerning Patterson Court and self-selection. The CCRL is moving well in the direction of assuming the active role that is
necessary for all the Advisory Councils. The Administration has always stressed that it values student and faculty participation and seeks
to train leaders for the larger community. Students are paying for their education and have a right to make recommendations
on decisions which affect them; the faculty should want to influence the environment in which they teach. Both students and
faculty deserve an effective channel through which to air their suggestions. Through the Advisory Councils, the students and faculty can
have input into decisions on admissions, the budget, intercollegiate athletics, and other important matters. These Councils could serve as key
links between the college community and the Board of Trustees. It is time that we exert pressure on the Councils
and push them into a position of prominence in Davidson's policy-making process.
