**Author William Styron highlights convocation**

By CHRISTI BAGGETT

William Styron spent last Friday at Davidson to present the Vereen Bell creative writing awards, receive an honorary degree, read from his works, answer questions, and give a short introduction to the movie based on his novel *Sophie’s Choice*. On receiving his honorary degree, Styron spoke with honesty, affection, and humor about his year as a Davidson student.

Styron was uncompromising in his description of Davidson in 1942. He recalled the strict rules — the prohibition of alcohol, the required Bible study — and his own accustomed profligacy. “My innate sinfulness was in constant conflict with the prevailing official piety,” he said. He speculated that his father had sent him to Davidson to keep him from a life of dissipation. “But I think,” he concluded, “he underestimated my resourcefulness.”

Styron told of losing his virginity to a “professional woman” in Charlotte who worked at the Green Hotel, “which, I understand, now lies mercifully under a 40-story building.” In those days, Styron reported, there were no blacks at Davidson, and no women (“only dreams of girls”), and no Jews, “and I think four Yankees. The rest of us were all sandy-haired Southern WASPs.”

He commented on the Davidson social life of 1942, saying that though the world was at war, Davidson students talked only of pledging fraternities. Styron remembered that he had been a Phi Delta Theta pledge and that Mooresville had been “as exciting to me as Marrakech. Or Atlanta.”

Styron admitted, “I recollect I was the most miserable freshman in the state of North Carolina,” yet explained that much of his unhappiness at Davidson stemmed from the general anxiety about World War II. Styron joined the Marines at the end of his freshman year, then studied at Duke University, where he received his undergraduate degree.

Styron read from his novel *Sophie’s Choice* and entertained questions on it and on his other works, which include *The Confessions of Nat Turner* and *Lie Down in Darkness*. Professor Anthony Abbott commented that listeners asked “very interesting questions” and that Styron had good answers. To one listener who asked how he, an American male, could presume to speak from the character of a Polish woman (Sophie), he responded that he did not consider himself simply “male.” All of us contain both masculine and feminine elements, he explained, and to illustrate he quoted Gustave Flaubert’s declaration, “Madame Bovary c’est moi.”

To another, who asked whether Sophie was doomed from the start, he replied that in a sense she was, for those who are treated constantly with violence and hatred, those who have human dignity stripped from them by other human beings — like Sophie at Auschwitz — learn to seek their own destruction.

Friday night Styron stood again on the stage in Love Auditorium, this time to talk briefly about the film based on *Sophie’s Choice*. He spoke with respect of Meryl Streep and said that the makers of the film had done a good job of adapting it from the novel. He recalled that French critics had complained about the movie's downplay of the passionate, sado-masochistic nature of Sophie’s relationship with Nathan; Styron agreed that such dilution of the novel was perhaps the film’s biggest fault.

“I think Mr. Styron really enjoyed his time here,” Abbott said. Abbott also recalled that during the post-Convocation luncheon Styron had described his current project: a novel tracing the changing attitudes of people towards war, which will begin with World War II and extend through the Korean and...Vietnam Wars. “He’s working with war’s psychological effects on people, not on exclusively Southern material.” Anne Lambert, winner of first prize in the Vereen Bell competition, called Mr. Styron “a very gracious man. Very nice, and very friendly. It really struck me at the luncheon that he was always leaning over to include my mom in the conversation. He didn’t even know her, he’d just met her, but still he wanted her to know what was going on.”

Styron, a Newport News, Virginia native, now lives in Roxbury, Connecticut. Explaining that Styron is a 61-year-old man who has recently suffered serious illness, Abbott commented, “This was the first major thing he’s done since he’s been sick, and I think it helped him realize that he could still do it — still function, be witty, use words well. And of course Davidson was a really supportive community for him.”

About Styron’s remarks at Convocation Abbott said, “I found them appropriate and interesting. They weren't meant at all cynically or ravagingly, I think — they were criticism combined with nostalgia.” “Maybe the truth doesn’t hurt,” Abbott laughed. “He told us honestly what Davidson was then, and we can listen and see what's better now, and what's not better now. Maybe that’s one of the functions of the artist.”

Asked whether Styron would consider himself a “Southern novelist” Abbott replied, probably not, or less and less so. “His first novel had a Southern protagonist, but his two last ones, Nat Turner and Sophie's Choice, involve characters whose experiences are quite different from Styron’s own — a slave, and a Polish woman, a prisoner at Auschwitz.”

Student-built shanty torn down by administration

By ANDY BARRON

Last Friday night, four students built a shanty and placed it on Chambers Lawn to protest apartheid in South Africa and to end apathy in the Davidson student body toward the apartheid issue. Less than six hours after the shanty was completed, college workmen dismantled it.

Director of College Relations Jerry Stockdale said that school administrators ordered the destruction of the shanty due to Chambers Lawn being part of Davidson College’s “historic area.” “Students are free to erect structures at other areas of the campus,” Stockdale said. “There will be no effort to try to curb those protests.”

The four students involved (freshmen Jay Barron, Greg Busby, Kevin Dunn, and Michael Schill) built the shanty late Friday night on the soccer field and then carted the construction to Chambers Lawn at about 3 a.m. “It looked like a piece of trash,” Schill said, “just like a shanty should look.”

Busby and Schill stayed with the shanty until Supervisor of Custodians William J. Barker arrived at 6 a.m. and told them the structure would be taken down while the Lawn was being set up for Alumni Weekend. The idea to build a shanty came from a flyer distributed by Andy Lamas, director of Alumni Against Apartheid. Chambers Lawn, the site of protests by groups such as Amnesty International, seemed like the best place for the shanty.

“Other worthy causes have been allowed to demonstrate on Chambers Lawn,” Busby said. “However, when the shanty was put up, the lawn was declared a historic area and the shanty torn down.” “It seemed more important that the grounds looked good for the alumni than it was for the students to voice their opinions,” Dunn said.

The students were concerned mainly with ending what they see as complete apathy on the part of the Davidson student body to the issue of apartheid. “It's time that students got out of their eating houses and into the real world,” Schill said.
