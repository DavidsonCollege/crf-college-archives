**Student apathy in elections appalling**

The field of candidates for Category II elections is a group of bright and motivated students—but it is far too small. With both Union Board vice-president positions being decided in unopposed races, and two students running for two Student Solicitor positions, there is very little choice in this election. Even three of the most important positions on campus—SGA president, SGA vice-president, and Union Board president—managed to attract only two candidates each. This is absurd. Winners of Category II elections take positions on trustee committees and assume ultimate student leadership offices. Why, in a school of overachievers and highly capable men and women, is there so little interest in such important posts?

There is a disturbing trend on this campus of piling one’s plate as high as a tray at Commons. Students generally take a heavy course load, and many—some despite claims to the contrary—put their work first. With the high participation figures for varsity, club, and intramural sports, and the amount of money spent on student organizations, it is obvious that most students are extracurricularly involved. There is a distinction between quantity and quality. Being on an email list doesn’t count as participating. Getting to meetings late (if at all) and not going to weekend events doesn’t help a cause, particularly when the excuse is, “I’ve got too much work.”

When a $140,000 education is at stake, work should come first. And students should use their time here to try a variety of social and service options. But dedication to one or two organizations is often more rewarding, and always more meaningful, than half-hearted resume stuffing. Given that, why aren’t the most influential organizations on campus attracting dedicated students?

While SGA does a lot of work no one ever hears about, that work often benefits very specific—and often small—subsets of the school. That doesn’t inspire the level of dedication and participation a governing body deserves. The work of a few for the benefit of a few should not be the focus of elected representatives. SGA should take its cue from the dearth of candidates in this election and commit itself to working on a bigger picture than Red Bikes or new grills. As long as the current perception of what SGA does remains, it is going to be faced with empty sign-up sheets for elections. And that’s a shame.

**‘They go in peace for all mankind’**

Remarks by President Bush at Tuesday's memorial for the seven astronauts killed on the Columbia:

Their mission was almost complete, and we lost them so close to home. The men and women of the Columbia had journeyed more than 6 million miles and were minutes away from arrival and reunion. The loss was sudden and terrible, and for their families, the grief is heavy. Our nation shares in your sorrow and in your pride. And today we remember not only one moment of tragedy, but seven lives of great purpose and achievement.

To leave behind Earth and air and gravity is an ancient dream of humanity. For these seven, it was a dream fulfilled. Each of these astronauts had the daring and discipline required of their calling. Each of them knew that great endeavors are inseparable from great risks. And each of them accepted those risks willingly, even joyfully, in the cause of discovery.

This cause of exploration and discovery is not an option we choose; it is a desire written in the human heart. We are that part of creation which seeks to understand all creation. We find the best among us, send them forth into unmapped darkness, and pray they will return. They go in peace for all mankind, and all mankind is in their debt. Yet, some explorers do not return. And the loss settles unfairly on a few. The families here today...shared in the courage of those they loved. But now they must face life and grief without them. The sorrow is lonely; but you are not alone. In time, you will find comfort and the grace to see you through. And in God’s own time, we can pray that the day of your reunion will come. And to the children who miss your Mom or Dad so much today, you need to know, they love you, and that love will always be with you. They were proud of you. And you can be proud of them for the rest of your life. The final days of their own lives were spent looking down upon this Earth. And now, on every continent, in every land they could see, the names of these astronauts are known and remembered. They will always have an honored place in the memory of this country. And today I offer the respect and gratitude of the people of the United States.

Removing Saddam is our only choice

Recent anti-war protests have attacked the prospect of war against Iraq as a cover for the dragging U.S. economy, an attempt to pump money into the U.S. oil industry, or a band-aid for George W. Bush’s lagging approval ratings. Ralliers argued that war against Iraq would be not only superfluous, it would bring irreparable harm to the people of Iraq. While demonstrations such as the one in Washington last week may make the Bin Ladens of the world smile with bated relief, the truth is that opponents have no substantial argument for the retention of the Iraqi regime, and fortunately no sway for what is sure to pass in the coming weeks.

Undoubtedly, Iraq poses a direct and prescient threat to the international community, namely the Iraqi people. While coalition forces prevented Saddam Hussein from developing nuclear weapons during the first Gulf War, they did not prevent him from killing tens of thousands of Iraqi Kurds with chemical weapons in 1988. U.N. inspectors have still been unable to account for tons of these chemical weapons, including over 150 biological bombs, some of which Iraq is suspected to have funneled to al-Qaeda. Saddam has a long history as a sponsor of terrorist groups such as the Abu Nidal Organization and currently provides $25,000 each to families of Palestinian suicide-bombers. Iraqi intelligence has a special department dedicated to liaison with Hamas, whose Baghdad office it funds. Hamas kills Israelis almost every day, and to support Saddam it has called for the murder of Americans. Iraq maintains direct contact with Ansar al-Islam, which has bases in northern Iraq near bordering the free Kurdish regions. Ansar al-Islam is an affiliate of al-Qaeda. In October, CIA director George Tenet declared to the Senate Intelligence Committee that Iraq, through Ansar al-Islam, provided training to al-Qaeda in using poisons and gases, and making conventional bombs.

Some opponents have criticized the United States’ willingness to “go it alone” in the approaching war. However, if the United States is the only nation in the world willing to remove a terrorist from power, then so be it. Iraq has violated sixteen binding UN Security Council resolutions over the last decade. These resolutions call on Iraq to disarm completely — but Saddam has defied them all. For this reason, the UN declared Iraq in “material breach” of its obligations.

War with Iraq is guaranteed not to be a panacea for Iraq’s problems: it will shock the nation and the rest of the Arab world to the core. However, if a united international community backs Saddam’s replacement, the nation may have a chance to liberalize, to democratize, and to liberate the Iraqi people who for so long have suffocated under the regime’s horrible oppression. By contrast, if Saddam is not replaced, the Iraqi people will soon discover that the international community’s apathy towards the regime’s atrocities is equally a manifestation of its apathy for the desperate, hopeless millions within Iraq’s borders.
