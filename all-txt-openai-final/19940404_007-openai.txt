A response to a faulty notion of civic virtue

Kimvely Kreiling’s last few articles can all be summed up in one brief sentence. Her flawed appeal for a welfare system based on government control is nothing more than a desperate battle plan of a liberal mugged by reality. Her last article, “There is a cuckoo in the Gull’s nest,” fervently but monotonously hammers out the “end of equality” idea and ends up in an accusatory guilt trip for all who disagree with her. Incidentally, Kreiling’s earnest but chimerical conclusions are just another last-ditch effort of Democrats who have already seen the follies committed under the banner of their far-fetched charity and compassion systems.

In her writing, Kreiling blends appeals to pity and ad hominem attacks with lessons in economics and history, which could easily be recognized as incomplete and false. First of all, the question of whether government has the responsibility to improve the population’s living standard does not belong to economics. It does not belong, as Kreiling would have us believe, to the realm of history, either. Instead, this is a purely political issue—something which the author does not seem to grasp very well.

Kreiling, undaunted, goes on to state that “it is the obligation of the government to provide the highest living standard possible, given the available resources.” She justly believes that government ought to strive for the best living condition attainable. However, this can only be done by allowing a free market economy, and not, as Kreiling suggests, by initiating various governmental subsidizing and regulating policies.

Further, the issue that the author completely misses is self-contained in the word “freedom.” The French and Russian revolutions took place not because of disproportionate distribution of wealth, but rather because of despotic rulers that deprived people of their freedom. The political systems that followed, by the way, eliminated the differences about which Kreiling worries so much, but to no avail—they only increased government police-like supervision of most aspects of daily life and thus destroyed the sacred notions of individuality and creativity, due to fear of being punished for standing out of the crowd.

My problem with Kreiling’s philosophy is rooted in her ill-advised blind faith in large-scale government programs, such as welfare systems and government-guaranteed and administered jobs and housing. Kreiling passionately writes about the “very factors that...

**Nathan Seay**

When I started writing this column about a year and a half ago, I knew that I would often dabble in material not often seen in newspapers and that some of my subject matter might upset a few people: the administration, the faculty, and Amanda Davis. True to my predictions, I got reactions from people over various things I wrote about: necrophilia, drinking, naked babies, passing out, flatulence, foul language, getting sick from drinking, nose picking, finishing your beer, voyeurism, getting high off cleaning products, playing with girls’ underwear, the occasional mention of how much beer means to me, and (how shall I put it? Oh, yes) self-love.

Since I knew that I was going to begin controversy, I made one basic ground rule that I vowed never to break. I promised myself that I would absolutely, positively, never ever apologize for anything that I had ever written to or about anyone, no matter how offensive, disgusting, slanderous, or wrong I may be. Granted, I have been sorely tempted to recant everything I ever said on one or two memorable occasions. I finally worked up the nerve to approach a certain girl whom I may or may not have been thinking about when writing some past article about nothing in particular. This was the first occasion I had to speak to her since she punched me in the stomach, so I wanted to make a good impression. I played smooth as long as I could. I had an urge to throw myself prostrate at her feet and scream, “I’m sorry! Please forgive me! I just couldn’t help it! I love you! Just let me kiss your feet and I’ll leave you alone! I am so unworthy!”

Fortunately for everyone concerned, I didn’t. I played it cool, and as per usual, she ran out of interest for me in approximately twelve seconds. The point is that I didn’t apologize even when confronted with those big blue eyes. I knew that I could write anything about anything and be safe keeping my vow. If those baby blues couldn’t break me, nothing could.

Well, it turns out that overconfidence once again turns out to be my downfall. Just as soon as I thought that for once in my life I could be unwavering about something which I truly believe in, trouble rears its ugly head. As most of you know, I was going through some rough times the two weeks before spring break. I was cut off from the only form of escapism effective enough to kill my thoughts. Denial stopped being enough long ago. Those of you who suffered through my article in the last issue of The Davidsonian know what I’m speaking of. The weekly installment of my ramblings was absolutely atrocious. I am embarrassed to put my name on that article. It is the worst thing I have ever written, including a book report on _Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret_ that I wrote in fifth grade.

So, in order to make it official that I have absolutely no integrity whatsoever, that nothing I say to...Anyone (including myself) can be trusted, here goes. Much like all the crustaceans I ate over spring break, I have no backbone. Just call me Soft Shelled Crab. To everyone who read my article in the last issue of The Davidsonian, I’m sorry.

When heroes fall

I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. As I walked down the stairs into the Commons, there it was, undeniably in my face as plain as day. Oh, horror of horrors! A member of the female persuasion was having a conversation with none other than Nathan Seay. “No,” you scream, “not the guy with the backwards hat that complains every week in The Davidsonian about how revolting he is to females! Not the guy that causes every girl on campus to run in sheer terror, especially those with keys hanging out of their back pockets!” Yes, I tell you. And that’s not the worst of it. Before my very eyes, this same female touched Nathan on the arm. It was not the defensive “back off” response you would expect, but a loving, caring touch. Unbelievable! He thought no one saw him, but now his cover has been blown. And my hero has fallen.

Yes, Nathan was the hero of many a Davidson underclass male, serving as a bastion of hope for those pathetic few that always seem to go unnoticed by the girls. He proved to us that it was still possible to lead a perfectly normal (well, at least semi-normal) college life without a date. Now, all that is gone. Sorry, Nathan, I wish it could have come to a better end than this.

All this just reinforces to me the importance of heroes in our society. At one point or another in their lives, everybody has a hero. Whether it be Tonya Harding, Bill Clinton, or Jeffrey Dahmer, each hero’s function is the same. A hero provides an ideal, a goal, or a hope for a person to model themselves after in their search for personal identity. But what happens when this ideal crashes in a fiery wreck? What happens when Harding breaks her opponent’s kneecaps, Clinton ruins the economy (Gullan owes me), and Dahmer—no need to elaborate there. It happens every day, folks. People that we place in positions of worship are sooner or later bound to disappoint us. So what do you do?

The way I see it, heroes are still human and are totally capable of succumbing to human nature, as hard as that is for some to believe. Therefore, we should not be too hard on our fallen heroes or hold any grudges. All of us have probably been guilty of some offense worthy of a fall, if we have been fortunate enough to be heroes to anyone.

I guess what it comes down to is that when your heroes fail, it’s time to become your own hero. Everybody’s got something inside of them that’s worthy of admiration and respect. It’s that something that each one of us needs to discover and bring to the forefront of our attention. A confident feeling of self-respect and personal worth is the key. Go ahead and try it. Live your ideal and be your own hero! You may surprise yourself. And as for you, Nathan Seay, you’re forgiven; but you’ve been supplanted by my new heroes, Beavis and Butthead.

have fostered the environment of economic growth in the United States for the last 100 years—public institutions.” Unfortunately for Kreiling, and fortunately for society, nothing could be farther from the truth. If we were to follow her recipe for prosperity, we would be, in fact, destroying the sense of community our society so badly needs. There is a term to describe the demagogic class structure to which Kreiling’s “road to a better world” leads—Communism. Kreiling does not appear to fathom that Communism did indeed collapse because it was founded on a mediocre philosophy, ignoring people’s self-interest.

Gull's Nest: Bill Gullan

The smoking of individual liberty

Commons and is told they have just banned smoking. He goes back to his room and opens the newspaper only to read that the Clinton administration is proposing smoking bans in all buildings (except homes) “regularly entered by ten or more people per week.” What is with these people? If this Clinton thing passes, owners of businesses will have no choice whether or not to permit smoking in their establishments. Imagine the federal government calling the owners of the Pub and telling them that they must now prohibit smoking. Bars would be affected, yes, but also restaurants, bowling alleys, warehouses, airports, stadiums, etc. I can imagine Clinton’s emissaries taking Davidson by force to arrest me for smoking in the Knox lounge (and, of course, stealing my wallet to pay for health care). Yes, the law as it is written would also apply to lounges of residence halls. The Clinton bill also bans smoking “in the immediate vicinity of the entrance” to any of these places. I will not only have to leave the bowling alley to smoke, but will be forced to go into the middle of the street, since the Taco Bell entrance next door is also too close. Isn’t this insane?

This government-as-nanny trend, insidious as it is, is downright evil when one looks at the acknowledged basis for this legislation: the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) report of January 7, 1993, which started this ball rolling. In this report, it was declared that “environmental tobacco smoke (ETS)” is basically equiva
