Davidson senior excels in political science essay contest

By Mari De Fede

Julia R. Chemotti, a senior from Cedarburg, WI, recently won second place in the 1999 Private Enterprise Essay Contest. Chemotti,
a political science major at Davidson, was first attracted to the contest after taking a civil liberties class which provided
her a strong foundation on the topic.

The contest, sponsored by the Americanism Educational League and The Pilgrim Foundation, was judged by a panel of economics and
business school professors. Both sponsoring organizations are non-profit foundations which stress the benefits of the free enterprise system. Her second
place prize included a $1500 cash honorarium.

Chemotti, one of several thousand students who entered the contest, disapproved of a proposed treaty which would create an international
court system. In her essay, entitled “The International Criminal Court: The Appropriate Vehicle for Delivering Justice?” she stressed that such
a system would create problems not only in its formation, but also problems of enforcement. She also addressed such issues
as the denial of civil liberties and the consequences of attempting to replace other countries’ judicial systems.

Chemotti participates in a variety of activities at Davidson. She studied abroad in Bolivia with the School for International Training
for a semester, was a member of the crew team, and sings with the Gospel Choir and Concert Choir.
