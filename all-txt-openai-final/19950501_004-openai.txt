**WALKING AWAY | Campus Police**

After an African-American visitor was stopped the weekend before Spring Break, the Vice President’s Committee for Ethnic and Minority Concerns
began meeting to evaluate the campus police’s treatment of African-American visitors on campus. The committee serves as an advisory board
to President John Kuykendall and is chaired by Executive Assistant to the President and Director of Institutional Research John Kelton.
Other members of the committee include junior Latasha Jenkins and Assistant Dean of Students John Eaves.

As Kelton explains, the committee privately makes recommendations to the president and the two communicate by personal correspondence. These personal
correspondences are more like letters than memos, and neither Kuykendall’s, Kelton’s, nor any other administrator’s office would give copies of
any communications to The Davidsonian. Kelton did reveal that recently his committee sent a letter which “made recommendations for procedure”
to Kuykendall. In turn, says Eaves, the president has asked Dean of Students Tom Shandley, Director of Auxiliary Services Richard
Terry, and Vice President for Business and Finance Bob Sutton to review the recommendations and respond to them.

The committee began working on the issue of the police stopping African-American visitors because “what we heard reported to the
committee was of concern to us,” says Kelton. The committee was troubled because “the frequency with which African-American visitors are
stopped is much higher,” says Eaves. Eaves does not attribute the difficulties between African-American visitors and the campus police to
racism but to socialization. “We are all negatively conditioned in this society that African-Americans, males especially, are prone to illegal
activity.”

He emphasizes that in the instance of the visitor before Spring Break and generally “there was no blatant, overt racism”
by the officers. “The types of things suggested [by the committee to remedy the situation] have primarily to do with
education, training, and sensitivity to these issues and procedures which will prevent the improper halting of visitors to our campus,”
says Kelton. Some kind of racial sensitivity is a priority for Eaves. Speaking of the police stopping African-American visitors more
frequently than whites, he says, “Because of the way we are conditioned, we may do things unconsciously.”

Eaves says he has good reason to be optimistic. Four years ago the police would sometimes stop African-American Davidson students
and ask them for their IDs. This really is not a problem anymore, according to Eaves. “I commend the campus
police for trying to make themselves more accessible,” he says. The committee’s recommendations are only tentative and may still be
amended, deleted, or added to by Shandley, Terry, or Sutton. The final proposal must be approved by Kuykendall. Eaves hopes
definite changes “will be activated by the next academic year.”

edged sword.” “There are more commercial outlets in Cornelius than there was our freshman year, as Cornelius has grown into
a small metropolis,” says B.J. Rudell, “Also, there is a closer male to female ratio, better weather, and a growing
squirrel population.”

Several seniors believe that the students have gotten smarter but are not as well-rounded. Tommy Suter thinks that “the student
body has taken to the books. We used to have crowds at away soccer games. People are too concerned about
their studies and do not concern themselves with extracurricular activities.” Grady Alsabrook says, “The people are smarter, but they are
lacking the other essentials, but hopefully by the time they are seniors they will get it together like our class
did.”

Economic and Political Science Journals. The ad reads, “Qualifications include the Ph.D. degree, administrative skills, significant international experience in government,
higher education, or the private sector, commitment to working with undergraduate students, foreign language proficiency, and a proven ability to
promote international studies to a broad public.” The director, whose primary job is to bring an international view of the
world to Davidson, also “brings visiting lecturers...to campus, organizes conferences, promotes Davidson College and international studies in the region,” according
to the advertisement, among many other responsibilities related to international studies. In addition to Williams, other members of the search
committee include Anthropology Professor Rosemary Zumwalt, French Professor Charles Dockery, Economics Professors Dennis Appleyard and Clark Ross, Political Science Professor
Louis Ortmeyer, and former SGA President Eric Rosenbach. “We're really looking for a superman or a superwoman ... replacing Jack
is a tall order,” adds Williams.

A few of the members of the Davidson College Concert Choir quietly leave Chambers after the Spring Convocation on Wednesday
morning. The choir performed Cantique de Jean Racine by Gabriel Fauré as a part of the Convocation ceremony.

feeling charitable. The National Endowment for the Humanities contributed $275,000 to our own Humanities program. The Cannon Foundation presented a
grant for $250,000, primarily for the Gym’s renovation as the new College Union. Plans for other buildings progressed. A new
Life Sciences Center will soon house state-of-the-art facilities for the biology and psychology departments. This year, all members of the
Class of 1995 and even some '96s got the opportunity to live in a senior apartment, with the addition of
Martin Court Building F. Other apartments received new identities - E, D, and A became Flowe, Ryburn, and Hart. B.
J. Rudell finally got additional basketball courts installed, right behind Building F.

As much as we like it here, it’s nice to get away. Davidson in India took its ninth group of
participants in the fall, and the art history Semester in England took its first trip this spring, joining the cycle
of other art programs in France and Italy. Next year, the French JYA will leave its home of 30 years
in Montpellier for Tours. And plans are in the works for a Davidson program in Africa.

Some nice folks came to visit. After three years, the NCAA Final Four played its last game at Richardson Field
in December. Just before that, the U.S. women’s soccer team played Finland here. Top 40 sensation Hootie & the Blowfish
played in the fall, and G Love and Special Sauce frolicked in the spring. Dr. Ruth spoke sexually, William Sloane
Coffin preached solidarity, and Project AIDS heightened our awareness.

FLAG’s growing presence continues to be felt. Their risqué fashion show in the fall raised $2,100, and the fifth annual
Sexuality Forum was better attended and received than ever.

Some of us even sought institutionalization. Some Greek houses, and WALT plan again after a long silence. A campus-wide recycling
program might be in place soon, and students were finally allowed to serve on five of the seven Board of
Trustees committees.

Ask any student about this past year and his or her response will be unique. Each event has a profound
effect on someone. As we leave Davidson, whether we will be returning or not, the events and controversies of the
1994-95 school year will always serve as at least a small part in memories of our college experience.
