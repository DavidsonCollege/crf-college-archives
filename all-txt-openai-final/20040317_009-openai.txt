Davidson Wildcat
‘not interested,’
area wildcats report

“I’m still going to try,” said
Kitty Wildcat, another who
failed to mate. “I mean, that’s
like sleeping with a movie star
or something. Honestly, there
aren’t many wildcat celebri-
ties.”

“And you know what they
say about wildcats with big
feet,” added Kitty. “He’s got
huge feet. Made of bronze.”

Though a national wildcat
sex symbol, the Davidson
Wildcat may be losing some of
his reputation, and rumors are
flying.

“I definitely made it clear
that I was interested,” said
Sandy Wildcat, "but he didn’t
even look at me. Maybe he
hunts with the other pack, if you know
what I mean.”

Others say these rumors are un-
founded. “He’s just shy,” said Kitty Wild-
cat. “A real gentleman wants to know a
lady before getting frisky.”

One wildly discredited theory, though,
suggests that the Davidson Wildcat may
be female. “We think he’s male,” said
Tabby Wildcat, “but that’s really just an
assumption. No one’s ever asked, I
guess.”

The Yowl has been unable to determine
if the Davidson Wildcat actually has geni-
talia.

The Wildcat doesn’t reach out to just anyone

BAKER DRIVE—Even after they dropped
all kinds of hints, area wildcats looking to
mate say the Davidson Wildcat, often
touted as the world’s largest, seems totally
not interested.

“Being made of bronze is definitely a
turn-on,” said Pussy Wildcat, who unsuc-
cessfully tried to mate with the 11-foot,
1,500-pound statue. “You'd think wildcats
would be all over him. But he ignores us
all. Never even turns around.”

With the arrival of spring, wildcat mat-
ing season is going full swing, but Wildcat
Weekly’s “Most Eligible Wildcat of 2003”
remains single.

What do you think?

CAT IN THE BAG: Dan Troyen-Schwartz stuffed fellow
freshman Molly Sawyer into a carry-on bag in order to avoid
a $240 bus ticket to Vermont over spring break. What do you
think of their stunt?

“I’m just glad to
see that the atmo-
sphere of creative
thinking fostered
by Davidson’s aca-
demic community
is yielding such
tangible benefits.”

“Whoa hold on
there...you’re
telling me there’s
a second-semes-
ter freshman girl
on this campus
thin enough to fit
into an overhead
luggage bin?”

“That’s one more
girl he got in the
sack than I did over
spring break.”

“If you were go-
ing to Vermont
for spring break
wouldn’t you
want to crawl
into a bag?”

“Just give me a
minute to collect
myself and dry the
tears I’m crying for
the ever-declining
state of students at
Davidson. Ok,
now, what hap-
pened on a bus?”

“See, now this is
why I don’t talk to
white people.”

No one ever said working
out was easy. Here are
some tips to help you
feel—and look—your best:

Tips for using the 24
hour workout room

After you finish a set on a weight ma-
chine, be sure to remove the pin and
reinsert it farther down the weight
stack. The next person will never know
you were only lifting 15 pounds.

Upon entering the 24 hour room, go
over to the CD player and ask loudly if
anyone would mind listening to your
mix of highly offensive music. Then
play it anyway.

Though more and more frequently at-
tempted, it is not possible to look cool
on an Elliptical if you are male.

Exercising in the weight-room can be
dangerous. Consider wearing a helmet.

If at all possible, avoid working out
with President Vagt. This will only de-
press your scrawny ass.

Purchasing a bodybuilding protein
supplement is a great way to waste $65.

If confused, read the little white card
featuring lifting instructions on each
machine before beginning your exer-
cises. Then look around quickly to
make sure no one saw you.

If you find it’s too crowded during
usual weekday hours, consider work-
ing out at a less frequented time, such
as 8:30 on a Friday night. It’s not like
you have anything else to do.

There’s nothing more annoying than
someone cutting in on your machine
when you're trying to finish your last
set. Be sure to reserve your space with a
lighted highway flare.

Always remember to buckle up before
using the abs machine. Failing to do so
is a leading cause of death among col-
lege students.

If you are female, make sure to wear
very small shorts and engage in need-
lessly awkward leg stretches on a blue
floor-mat. Nothing attracts less atten-
tion than this.

Making grunting noises and dropping
weights loudly upon the floor is an ex-
cellent method of compensation for
your undersized penis.

Taking intermittent breaks between sets
is highly recommended while lifting. To
pass the time, go outside and smoke.

It might be that you’re simply not cut
out for the intensity of heavy weight-
training. Consider alternative, less tax-
ing sports, such as Club Web-Site De-
sign, or Varsity Baseball.

When checking out girls in the weight
room, make use of the abundant wall
mirrors. That’s what they’re there for.

If you have a question, do not hesitate
to ask the student at the work-study
desk. There is no person more useful
than the student at the work-study
desk.

Before entering the 24 hour room, dis-
abuse yourself of the notion that you are
hard core. If you were, you’d be work-
ing out in Baker.
