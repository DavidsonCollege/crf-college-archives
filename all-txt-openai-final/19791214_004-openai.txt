**The Davidsonian**

Founded 1914

Recently, staged. Why haven't fund drives for Davidson itself elicited similar enthusiasm and support? Davidson students and alumni don’t often give money to Davidson. This is reflected in recent senior class gift efforts and in various alumni donation records. Currently, the participation rate is 30 percent; this is far below what many comparable schools experience. Swarthmore, for example, has a 50 percent participation rate, while Princeton and Williams get donations from 66 and 56 percent of their alumni, respectively. Davidson is far above the national average of 17.5 percent, but Davidson is different from most other schools in the country. Government money accounts for a minuscule amount of the College’s expenses. Yet our endowment is not nearly as big as that of other small liberal arts colleges. Davidson is dependent on alumni giving and all of us who are students will eventually become alumni. If we don’t support this college, who will? More importantly, how can we expect other people to look at Davidson as a worthy institution if we, as students and as alumni, don’t treat it as one? One’s belief as to whether Davidson is, indeed, a place worthy of our hard-earned money is one that separates the donors from the cheapskates. Many students, when asked if they will give money to Davidson, flatly say no. When pressed, they point out the problems the College has, like recent tenure decisions, the “student” radio station affair, the problems with faculty salaries and morale, the athletic priorities; the list is regrettably long. Don’t students realize that some of the most serious problems could be relieved if alumni took on additional financial responsibility? Davidson students, you and me and people in the past, are subsidized. Currently, our tuition, high as it may seem, pays for 47 percent of the total cost of our education. The rest comes from endowment income, trust income, and gifts. In other words, it comes from alumni. It comes from us. All Davidson alumni have been substantially subsidized Davidson students. A little money from every alumnus would add up to a significant amount. And a significant amount of money could solve some of our problems. Many of the very shortcomings that non-donors point to could be alleviated. The athletic priorities and the “student” radio station are just two examples. Athletic priorities have bothered a lot of us recently. One of the main reasons that some people claim we must promote high-powered teams is that these sports bring in the bucks. The argument is that some alumni get attached to our big-time teams and give money to Davidson. If only all alumni would give to Davidson, we wouldn’t have to try and entice potential donors with overinflated athletic programs. More money could be diverted to the minor and intramural sports that directly involve more Davidson students. The college radio station is another facet of Davidson that seems in danger of becoming a promotional effort instead of serving the needs of the students. If only alumni gave a little more, then maybe we wouldn't have to worry about impressing potential donors with a powerful station and we could have a student-run station. The alumni giving problem is circular. The less we give, the more time, energy, and money the college has to divert to money-making ventures. This means less time, energy, and money to aspects of Davidson that are important to us as students. The fact that students have really dug deep into their pockets for Cambodia is cheering. Alumni, they can at least reach into their pockets for Davidson.

*Remarkable Job*

This letter was signed by fifteen members of the soccer team.

To the Editor:

Today we, the members of the Davidson Varsity Soccer team, learned of the decision not to re-hire our coach, Karl Kremser. Needless to say, this news was very distressing to the majority of the members of this team, and it causes us great consternation. We wonder how such a decision could have been reached in light of all that he has done for the soccer program at Davidson College. Considering what he started with three years ago, he has done a truly remarkable job. This season was the...Best year Davidson soccer has had since 1974. This is due in large measure to the incredible amount of work he puts into the program both on the field and off. For example, the last two years spent recruiting players were very successful, and this year promises to be better still. Members of the team have actively participated in this year’s recruiting effort and are very enthusiastic about its chances for success. However, no incoming freshman is likely to attend a school where the man that recruited him is no longer holding a job. Karl Kremser's achievements in the sport of soccer are tremendous. He is a member of the board that ranks the soccer teams in the southern United States. He coaches the North Carolina State “Under 16” soccer team. He holds a United States Soccer Federation “A” license in coaching, one of four in the entire state of North Carolina. He was selected, one of sixteen, to attend a seminar in coaching held by the coaches of the German National Team. This is not an honor that he applied for; they contacted him. What about his relationship with the team? True, team members have been heard to gripe from time to time, but what members of any team don’t gripe? Karl Kremser has his faults, but if the team can accept these faults as part of the package, he should be acceptable to everyone. We have had our disagreements with him. The important thing here is that they were overcome. It has been said that he has trouble relating to his players. This may have been true three years ago and may be so to some extent today, but the improvement in coach-team relationships over those same three years has been marked. In three years, Karl Kremser has taken a group of players and made them into a team. He made them into a self-respecting team that could play competitively with teams that were nationally ranked. Considering the short period of time that Karl Kremser has been our coach, the amount of good he has done for the soccer program is amazing. Now that the foundation for a strong, competitive program is being built, we, the undersigned, feel that the absence of our coach, Karl Kremser, next fall will be a severe blow to the continued success of soccer at Davidson.

Severe Setback

To the Editor:

You cannot build a soccer program in a day, but you can just about destroy one. The refusal by the Department of Athletics to renew Coach Kremser’s contract threatens to set back severely Davidson's newly revived soccer program. The administration presently has yet to reveal their rationale, but they certainly do not have a better coach in mind. A person more qualified to build a team which can compete respectably in the Southern Conference will indeed be hard to find. Soccer has grown tremendously at Davidson in the three years since Coach Kremser’s arrival. The quality and depth of this year’s team, the potential recruits whom Coach Kremser is bringing to Davidson, and the soccer matches bear witness to this fact. Even if another qualified coach is found, how does Davidson expect to offer him any fair chance at a secure position? After all, we just fired the Southern Conference Coach of the Year!

Academic Regulations

To the Editor:

I have recently become aware of a serious flaw in the academic regulations at Davidson. After the first week of winter term, I decided to leave Davidson. This was not a decision that I reached lightly. I came back for winter term only to be sure that my reasons for leaving were valid. But my reasons for leaving are not the issue. While withdrawing, I was told that in my winter term classes I would receive F’s. These F’s are in classes that I have attended for less than ten days. They will scar my transcript, making it difficult for me to be admitted to other schools. I am not leaving Davidson for academic reasons, and I am appalled that these F’s will follow me throughout my education. Incompletes rather than F’s would seem to be a much fairer solution. The F’s make the consequences for leaving Davidson too severe. Possibly a review of the academic regulations is in order.
