"Hey, how many of our folks are coming for Parents Weekend? Ya suppose we oughtta clean up the place or something?"

"No time, dude. Better get a case of these stick-up air fresheners, though."

"Stop vacuuming. First, remove the hamburger from underneath the bed. Get a snow shovel for the beer cans. And for God's sake, get rid of those air fresheners and get me a hose..."

"Are you going in my closet?"

"Strip? Any way, no one ever looks at this."

"Are you wearing that awful mask?"

"Perfect thing."

"Thanks, Hal. Sorry 'bout the mask."

"Hal, I don't think he'll like the looks of this."

"Look now, but once inside, he finds out that he isn't the only one who uses Hal's shake for a hiding place."

"Making profits off of the exploitation of those blacks in South Africa is bad."

"Ox, it says here that Davidson has invested in companies that produce..."

"Look, there are the college's principles locked in that box. They must keep them there when negotiating investment policies."

"Speaking of investments, carrot slices!"

"I think you should look at the editors of worse, state & stent organization. Sorry, ex?"
