Sideline The Real Game

By CAROLINE HAUSER
Sports Editor

Contrary to popular belief, the biggest sporting event on campus this weekend was not the lacrosse match. No, before Davidson
saluted the dedication of its seniors, it braced for an even more intense battle of skill and stamina: Decision Davidson.
For a day-long affair challenged in endurance only by the Ironman, families raced from lectures to lunch, from department fairs
to activities fairs in less than fair weather. Mothers jockeyed for position, wearing the regulation mother uniform—capris and cardigan twinsets.
Fathers coached from the sidelines, “Let’s meet him; shake her hand.” Prospective students guzzled pink lemonade like Powerade and gave
it their best.

In the seventeen-year-old’s world, the college selection process has become the equivalent of The Great Race. Driving and flying across
the country like the big-money recruits they are, holding out for the best contract. And these aren’t even the new
athletes. In an unregulated draft like Decision Davidson, though, it’s hard to distinguish between the good, the bad, and the
clumsy. Here, all the draftees are presidents and captains, editors and quarterbacks, overachievers and...overachievers. One kid, heading for a social
action club’s booth, was intercepted by his father, and herded towards the club sports table. Something about competition. But isn’t
everything?

Be all you can be, and we'll push you to the edge: then tell you to keep going. You know
it’s in you. The desire to go farther. To start where others stop. That’s why you should consider Army ROTC.
It's a class where you’ll face unique challenges while developing skills like how to think on your feet and be
a good leader.

Tight loss spoils Senior Day

Sports INFORMATION Press Release

The Davidson women’s lacrosse dropped a heartbreaking 11-10 decision to the eighth-ranked Commodores of Vanderbilt Sunday afternoon in an American
Lacrosse Conference tilt at Richardson Stadium. With the loss, Davidson falls to 5-8 on the season and 0-2 in league
play while Vanderbilt improves to 8-3 overall and 4-0 in ALC action.

The Wildcats came to play on Senior Day and jumped out to a quick 3-0 lead. Junior Margy McCeney got
things started for the Wildcats at the 1:18 mark as she scored off a pass from senior Sarah Otto. Seaton
added her second goal of the game just :24 later. Senior Blair Otto netted the team’s third goal off an
assist from Seaton at the 2:53 mark. Vanderbilt eventually got a goal on the board, but the Wildcats quickly responded
as Seaton assisted senior Christin Raimondo to make the score 4-1 in favor of Davidson.

The Wildcat defense, which played a solid game throughout, kept the Commodore offense scoreless for the next six minutes. Senior
Sarah Otto scored her first goal of the game at the 13:20 mark. It took another 13 minutes for another
Davidson goal, but Sarah Otto came up with a great pass to freshman Lindsay Frank to put Davidson up 6-5.
After a Vandy goal, freshman Whitney Diefendorf scored on an assist from Seaton. The teams continued to do battle at
both ends of the field and Davidson entered the halftime intermission leading 7-6.

Vanderbilt’s Jess Roguski tied the game, 10-10, at the 38:04 mark. Sarah Otto scored the next two goals for Davidson;
unfortunately for the Wildcats, Vanderbilt netted three goals in that span and held a 10-9 edge with just over 10
minutes to play in the contest. Loren Seaton scored what proved to be the game-winning goal at the 50:45 mark
off a pass from Liz Drennan. Raimondo scored a goal for the Wildcats at 52:55, but Davidson was never able
to get the tying goal.

“I thought we played with a lot of heart and intensity,” said Davidson head coach Mary Schwartz. “We showed this
afternoon that we can play with anyone in the country and while it was a difficult loss, that will hopefully
give us some momentum for our final four games.”

The Wildcats hit the road for their final four games. All four of the final contests will be American Lacrosse
Conference games with the first coming April 19 at Penn State at 4:00.
