WITH THE ALUMNI.
CLASS REUNIONS.

A special effort is being made to systematize the reunions of the classes at commencements. It is planned to form groups of the classes that are five years apart. Although last year marked the real beginning of this effort, already quite a number of groups are working, and it is assured that many more will follow.

AN ITEM FROM CHINA.
The president’s office has received a copy of the new catalog of the Chinkiang, China, Presbyterian High School of our Southern Presbyterian Mission. This school has an enrollment of eighty-three in the grammar and high school departments and is to add buildings for the accommodation of 100 additional students. Two interesting features of the school are: that the principal is a Davidson man, Rev. Donald W. Richardson, '02, and valedictorian of his class, and that the motto adopted for the school is that of Davidson College—"Alenda Lux Ubi Orta Libertas."

BOXING CLASS NOTES.
The boxing class now has its regular meetings every Tuesday and Thursday nights in the gymnasium. It is making good progress under Coach Kluttz and is getting in shape for a series of exhibition bouts, which will be staged about the middle of April. Baseball and cold weather have interfered with the work to some extent, but interest is now on the increase.

Rev. A. W. Crawford, Superintendent of Synodical Home Missions, filled the local Presbyterian pulpit at both services Sunday, March 19. The subject of the morning was a plea for Home Missions in North Carolina. Mr. Crawford is the father of L. A. Crawford, of the Senior class.
