**Davidsonians Reflect**

**Lee Willingham '48**

**Director of the Living Endowment**

Lee Willingham transferred from Augusta College to Davidson in 1945. “Being a transfer I was accused of freshman violations,” he explained, “and I wasn’t a freshman!”

All the students had to adapt to a great change because of the reentry of many army men into college. “We had to make a great adjustment. The integration of fresh-out-of-high-school students with older army men was somewhat awkward.”

Mr. Willingham was also required to attend daily chapels. “I have both positive and humorous recollections about this... I still remember one year shortly before the holiday vacation. I was sitting in chapel and heard someone begin to chant ‘Hark the herald angels shout: three more days and we’ll be out!’”

Mr. Willingham was a member of Phi Delta Theta fraternity. “There just weren’t as many parties then,” he said. The year before Mr. Willingham came to Davidson, the college began allowing dances on campus. “Still, most dances were in Charlotte because we had no place to have them.”

“All in all,” he summarized, “it was quiet. We had to make our own activities. Except on big weekends, we had to go out and find them [activities] in Charlotte or wherever.”

“Davidson is academically stronger,” Willingham said, but he stressed that “the requirements inside and outside of the classroom were tough” when he was a student.

**Sandy Carnegie '50**

**Executive Director of the Wildcat Club**

Sandy Carnegie was a Davidson freshman in 1946 and an ex-G.I. from World War II. “It was an interesting time,” he said. Because of the war’s interruption, “I literally went to school with people who started here as early as 1940 and as late as 1949.”

Mr. Carnegie played varsity football all four years, but he “quickly found out that football was far from being in first place at Davidson, and you had to study.”

As for the classes themselves, “the ability to get the kind of education you want is much more flexible than those days,” Mr. Carnegie said. The electives were “not nearly so numerous as the opportunities you have today... I think that’s a mark of the times.”

Mr. Carnegie regrets the loss of the chapel period. “I think the best thing it did was the camaraderie of the student body,” he said. “To me the tragedy is that at Davidson College today there is never a time when the total student body meets.”

While Mr. Carnegie was still at Davidson, he married and had his first child. The college offered used old army barracks across the street from the Cunningham Fine Arts building as housing for married students. They were called the ‘Cardboard Village’ because the walls were paper thin. “There were no secrets in the Cardboard Village,” Mr. Carnegie said. “My daughter was born the night we beat North Carolina State in Charlotte, and I was playing football. That was a great night for me... I remember studying for exams and rocking that little girl, and I didn’t think anything could be tougher than doing both of them at the same time.”

**Will Terry '54**

**Dean of Students**

Will Terry entered as a freshman in 1950. Fraternities ruled his first week on campus. “One of the real difficulties with freshman year was that rush was the first week of school. So, you went through the ringer before you even got adjusted to college. Fraternities dominated social life, and if you weren’t in a fraternity, you didn’t have a social life.”

Dean Terry has observed many changes in curriculum, students, and faculty. “The curriculum is much broader and the requirements are less stringent. The student body is much more highly selective. Students weren’t as sophisticated as they are now. As far as the faculty is concerned, in some ways the quality of the faculty is probably stronger now, but the commitment to teaching is not any stronger.”

“Coeducation is the best improvement I have seen at Davidson. The freshman hall situation is the best improvement next to coeducation. With our large size, the loss of community, and the loss of unity is our greatest loss, and the sense of community will continue to diminish if the college gets larger.”
