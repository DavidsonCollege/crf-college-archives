Home Is The Best Place to Practice New Steps
A little practice at home works wonders in giving you grace and certainty in executing the new dances. But you need the right kind of music. The very thing for the latest dances is among the new player music now in. Let us play the latest one-step, Fox Trots, etc., for you on the Stieff Player Piano. It will open your eyes to the pleasures which are in store for you when you own a Stieff Player Piano. Call tomorrow and ask to hear them. While you are here we will gladly explain how you can apply your old piano as part payment and take your time paying the balance. No interest or extras.

THREE GOOD GAMES
(Continued from page 1)
Batteries: Hengeveld and Alford, Darlington. Cyatag, Engle and toe kabec. Two-base hits: Groome, Ansley, Bakey (2); three-base hits: Munch; struck out by Hengeveld 4, Darlington 3, Engle 331. Davidson 140 002 OON Ob yy 5 base on balls, off Hengeveld 4. Gomme 331 Richmond 000 000 VOI 3 hit by pitched ball: Bakey and Sheean by Hengeveld, balk. Hengeveld. Umpires, Cravion, Sima, and Darlington. Two-base hits: Groome, Lippon; struck out by Groome.

Davidson won her fourth game of the season on Saturday, April 10, by defeating Richmond College 6 to 1. Groome pitched a splendid game for the Red and Black. He allowed the visitors only one hit until the ninth inning, but in that frame, after two men were down, two more hits were given up to the Spiders. He also had perfect control. Not a man was givena tree pass to the initial sack. Robertson pitched a good game for Richmond, except for two bad innings, the second and the sixth. At other times he had good stuff, and the locals found some trouble in solving his delivery. The visitors' only run came in the ninth with two men down. Cox was safe at first on a bad throw by Somerville and went to second when the ball passed over Stough’s head. Liggon then hit to the left field fence for two bases, scoring Cox. Pitt then singled, but it was too short for Liggon to score on. The batting of Groome and Austin featured for Davidson, Groome getting a three-bagger, and also lengthened his to a home run on an error. Davidson scored one in the first inning: Christenbury, the first man up, singled. Groome then tightened up and the next man up fanned the breeze.

Davidson Again Defeats Wofford.

On Monday, Davidson again defeated Wofford to the tune of 5 to 3, this time on the Wofford home ground. The game was close throughout, neither side scoring till the fifth, when Wofford eased one across on a pass on balls, an error, and a hit. Not to be outdone, Davidson came back strong in the sixth with two and added one more in the seventh and two more in the eighth. Lawson pitched superb ball, allowing only three scratch hits, and should have come off much better, but his support was weak at times. Eddy, for Wofford, pitched good ball till the sixth, when the ‘Red and Black’ slappers found him.

Batteries: Davidson, Lawson and Allred; Wofford, Eddy and Osborne.

Davidson: Runs, 5; hits, 10; errors, 2.
Wofford: Runs, 3; hits, 3; errors, 3.

It is of interest to note that the new course of physical training adopted by Washington and Lee University is the one worked out by Dr. J. McConnell for Davidson and approved by Dr. Smith. When the new gymnasium is completed it will be enforced at Davidson. All students in the lower classes will have to acquire a certain degree of physical development before graduation, and a course in physiology and hygiene will form part of the curriculum in the department of physical training.
