THE DAVIDSONIAN HUMOR HOMECOMING 2005 WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 5, 2005

POINT/COUNTERPOINT

Should CheerBot 5000s be allowed to perform at football games?

Dr. Zeigfreid Pollywhipplestein, Cold Fusion Department

CheerBot 5000s are a disgrace, plain and simple. They have no place on the synthetic fiber-field, and certainly not at
such wholesome events as Davidson Homecoming. I have been teaching here for 260 years, and I have never seen such
blatant objectifying of robot women. It is disgraceful. The skirts are so short you can practically see their circuitry, and
I don’t much care to see their wiring jiggle around as they space dance. We should have cut the blue
wire years ago. I remember when it was wholesome space women and cyborgs cheerleading, filled with nothing but school spirit
and Energizer batteries. The CheerBots out there these days are all liquored up on synthetic motor oil and washer fluid,
and that is the kind of licentious behavior that can seriously damage the Davidson reputation. I am all for diversity,
but not when it involves robot sex in dance form. The entire football game, I heard catcalls like “show me
your ohms!” and “I'd like to close your series circuit!”—utterly disgraceful. All I want to do is eat a corn
dog with my grandson and cheer on our squad. I don’t want to see drunk FratBots grabbing their magnets and
shouting obscenities. I’ve never seen such objectification of robots, and it does nothing but perpetuate a culture that degrades Direct
Current beings and gives Alternating Current free reign. Davidson needs to seriously reconsider their image, priorities, and obligations to the
greater community.

Class of 1922

JEB WITTINGTON

This weekend was the first time I visited our fine campus since I graduated in 1923. The most prominent change
that I noticed around here is the addition of many new parking lots for automobiles. You youngsters might be thinking,
“Hold your britches, sir, what about the females we have here now?” Well I’d say to you that we had
plenty of women-folk back in the good old days, too. We were what you might nowadays call “players”. No, it’s
those new paved squares in which to park our automobiles that really gets me excited. It’s like I always said
back then, we have some of the richest folk around learning here, and we need to be able to drive
our expensive new automobiles to school. It has made moving in far easier since y’all don’t have to have your
blasted parents drive you up or carry your clothing in a sack all the way from Cornelius or Mooresville. The
addition of a space to park automobiles even attracted some of the leading scholars from Charlotte itself! Heck, it was
like I said back in ’22, “It’s almost imperative that we got a parking lot for our automobiles if we
ever fancy on becoming a competitive educational institution.” Another thing, and I think everyone will agree with me on this
one, is that the town of Davidson is not very stimulating for the rip-roaring young man these days, as it
wasn’t back in those. You can only take so many dates to the Soda Shop and Gnome Store before it
gets old. We needed to be able to pilot our personal automobiles to exotic places like Huntersville, where I hear
they just opened up a Waffle House breakfast-style eatery. Some of the faculty back then also requested a designated automobile
parking area. The English professor, Dr. Hanson, owned a Ford automobile, and two of our other six professors were considering
purchasing.a machine. Today, in one of those rectangles, I even saw one of those Japanese automobiles. Back in ’23, the
grassy field just off Main Street was the perfect place to park an automobile, and it even had soft grass
for kneeling while cranking up the engine. The campus police officer, however, disallowed the parking of automobiles there. He claimed
that area was for pitching footballs and picnics with gals. There were plenty of open grassy fields for playing pick-up
sports and other outside horseplay on this campus though! And boy doggity did history prove him wrong. I can’t get
around too well anymore, but I’m sure there are still plenty of open grassy fields on this campus for doing
long division and playing sports.

Class Of 1227 BCE
DAVIDSON

WANG ZHOU

The chi was flowing splendidly at Homecoming this past weekend at Davidson. I was reminded of my days as an
undergraduate; watching football games in the fall, exchanging pleasantries with friends as I walked to class, and crushing the barbaric
Mongolian hordes from Wofford. After a full year of work moving bricks, however, Emperor Chang abandoned the Great Wall plans
and we used the bricks to lay a number of stylish walkways. The Wofford Mongols wreaked havoc on the college
nearly every weekend, but those sidewalks really looked smart. I will admit, our football team was a little better back
then. Only it wasn’t so much a football team, as much as it was a trained group of horse-riding swordsmen.
We would play other colleges whenever there was a territorial dispute to be settled. Decked out in our finest armor,
with Wildcats’ flags waving, we would demolish nearby universities and claim their facilities as our own. Survivors were beheaded. Back
then, Davidson College spanned over most of North Carolina and even a fair amount into South Carolina. Our domination was
well known across the land, and our swordsmen the finest trained. Things began to deteriorate when the better warriors started
to attend state universities instead of Davidson, because we could not offer as many scholarships and demanded more from student
warriors academically.

Yes, things have changed here at Davidson College since I attended. They truly were the best days of my life.
Patterson Court was alive with energy and flowing with good spirits, just as it was so many years ago, when
it was known as the Wang Court. But so many things remain the same. Chambers has been renovated, and failing
students are no longer sacrificed, but the Honor Code continues to work. The Presbyterian Church has replaced the college’s former
ties with The Temple of the God of Wind, but school concerts are still disappointing and poorly attended. Students today
may have seen me walking around campus last weekend and think that we have little in common. But we do
have something in common. Davidson tradition binds us together, and we are all Wildcats. I’m just a really old, Ming
dynasty Wildcat.
