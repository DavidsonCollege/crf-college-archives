**Foerster Wants Coeducation Now**

To The Editor:

There has been much discussion on the topic of coeducation here at Davidson College in THE DAVIDSONIAN, in the SGA
Senate, among the students at large, and certainly among the faculty and members of the administration. I would, through this
letter, like to make several observations about the apparent crisis that we are now all facing: shall we sexually integrate
or remain a segregated community, a bastion of male living. These observations should not only be considered by students and
faculty but also more importantly by the administration and members of the Board of Trustees, since the college president, Dr.
Samuel R. Spencer, indicates that the decision finally rests in their hands.

We have at Davidson College a most novel environment. It could perhaps be best termed a microcosm of society, but
in a real sense a purified society. It is a unique community that prides itself on its academic quality, its
dedication to the Christian faith, its moral and social awareness which grows, to a great extent, out of a dedication
to Christianity, its openness and genuine concern for the needs and wants of others. But Davidson and its environment sorely
lack in completeness. Under the present structure, it, because of unnatural limitations, has no other choice but to remain an
unfilled community.

Other issues, i.e., the comprehensive fee recently implemented by the comptroller’s office, heated debates, faculty meetings, student assemblies, progressive educational
implementations, Wednesday coffee with Dr. Spencer, and all other kinds of intellectual verbiage will stir up the dust and take
attention away from the coeducation issue, but will fail to obscure it. Life at Davidson will continue to be fragmented
and unnatural as long as we remain unisexed.

There are definite advantages to having coeducation here at Davidson College. One of the most important is psychological or emotional
in nature. Most sociologists agree that a community is merely an extension of an individual personage. Individuals naturally congregate because
it fulfills a human need—interaction. Man, because of his created nature, has certain healthy psychological needs for female companionship. Students,
faculty members, members of the administration, and trustee members who oppose coeducation because it would violate that sacred Davidson tradition
of male celibacy or for some other insane and unhealthy reason are quick to point out that Davidson students do
see girls, that they do have female contact. If they would, however, carefully examine the nature of this contact they
would quickly realize its perverted nature.

**Homecoming Is ‘Good Clean Fun’**

Homecoming is Love. It is simple yet so profound it brings tears to the eyes of old alumni and joy
to the hearts of the young. It marks the close of sultry summer with its sweltering pavements and the advent
of fall with its pastel beauty. Homecoming is thinking of Mom and Dad. It is holding your sweetheart’s hand in
yours. It is frolicking about campus carefree and full of life. It is good clean fun.

Homecoming is memories. It is the lingering fragrance of a corsage. It is a dream made up of yesterday's hopes
and today’s realities. Homecoming is a realigning of priorities. It is a renewed leap of faith. It is feeling a
warm thrill at seeing your flag. Homecoming is realizing you have come far in life. It is the light at
the end of the tunnel. It is a reason to be.

Homecoming is Rod McKuen. It is long walks on the cross-country course. It is a letter from home. It is
feeling a purge of soul. Homecoming is one lonely tear. It is caring for those who care for you. It
is thinking of your future. It is the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.

Homecoming is slapping your professor on the back. It is the freshman’s first feeling of belonging. It is chasing the
bright elusive butterfly of love. Homecoming is seeing the vapor of your breath mingle with that of your date. It
is nostalgia. Homecoming is the thrill of the gridiron. It is the brilliance of your school colors. It is running
out on the field after the game.

Homecoming is happiness. It is frost on the pumpkins. It is cookies from home. Homecoming is never having to say
you're sorry. It is that stolen kiss. It is counting the stars. It is kittens and puppies. Homecoming is the
crowning of a queen. It is the fraternity sweetheart. It is a breath of fresh air. It is a kiss
in the rain. Homecoming is putting your cares aside. It is kept promises. It is a gentle rain on a
chapel. Homecoming is cheese, wine, and bread. It is Paris in the spring. It is a feeling of fulfillment. It
is the reunion with old friends.Homecoming is a warm laugh on a cold night. It is hot chocolate on a
snowy day. Homecoming is Snow White, Cinderella, and Doris Day. Homecoming is a once-a-year happening. Faith, Hope, Love, these three,
but the greatest of these is Homecoming. When members of the community (students) feel that it is necessary to import
prostitutes (What-A-Burger - Winter of 1970), there is something terribly wrong somewhere. We, students, in our formative years, need educational
experiences which cater to all aspects of life. I do not feel that any responsible individuals would term the aforementioned
experience healthy and beneficial to human development. When deprived of natural living conditions, no matter what means of pacification is
fabricated to cover its absence up, and that we are living in a deprived environment, experiences like the above will
continue, some being more subtle than others. If the harmful effects which something like the above causes are to be
avoided, we must co-educate without unnecessary delay. We are presently caught up with unnecessary and harmful discussion. Coeducation is the
only solution.

Poet To Give Reading Monday

On the heels of Homecoming, the Poetry Circuit will host its first visiting poet this Monday. He is Howard McCord,
who will be touring colleges all over the Southeast for the next month. In addition to McCord’s most recent book
of poetry, Maps, published this past June, other works include: Fables and Transfigurations, Longjaunes His Periplus (which sold out within
a year of publication), The Fire Visions, The Life of Fraenkel’s Death, and The Spanish Dark. This fall McCord became
Director of the MFA Writing Program at Bowling Green State University in Ohio. For the previous 11 years, he had
taught poetry, mythology, and a course in Eastern civilizations at Washington State University. McCord took his B.A. from the University
of Texas at El Paso, and went to the University of Utah as a National Woodrow Wilson Fellow for his
graduate work. McCord will conduct a workshop in the newly-remodeled Carolina Inn Monday at 3 p.m. and will follow with
a reading that night at 7 p.m. in the Union Bar.
