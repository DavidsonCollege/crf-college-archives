It is reported that Fresh Pat Harmon is so dumb that he thinks the six Brown Brothers composed the Sextette
from Lucia.

Rumple: “I've got to go change my clothes.”
Watts: “Change your clothes? Why, when you button your coat your trunk is locked.”

A member of Soph Bible says that Adam was made first so that he could get to say something.

Kid Lyerly almost got drowned last night. The pillow slipped, the bed spread, and he fell through the mattress into
the spring.

“The charge of the Light Brigade,” said Fresh Shaw as he reached for his twenty-first biscuit, “going to the jaws
of death.”

John Crinkley will now surrender his uplifting little ditty, entitled: “I call my girl Annie Laurie because her neck is
like a swan.”

Fresh Ebey says: “A little man has lots of big business about him. Look me over, boys.”

A slender young lady named Lena
Bought herself a vacuum cleaner,
But I’m sorry to say,
She got in its way.
Since then no one has seen her.

Gibbs (at Efird’s): “Have you any white ducks?”
Clerk: “What do you think this is, a poultry store?”

Archie Ray is auctioning off all the pictures in his room for eleven dollars. The R. O. T. C. department
is having to establish a guard around his room to keep the flappers off. 25,000 young damsels came down on
the shuttle train from Mount Mourne to get his picture of Rudolph Vaselino, but some Davidson lady beat them to
it.

Heard at a colored church in Moultrie, Ga.:
“Sistern, I'se gwine ter preach a pow’ful sermon dis evenin’. I'se gwine ter define de undefinable, explain de unexplainable, and
unscrew de unscrutible.”

John Gallant is so dumb that he thinks a post graduate is a person who received a diploma from a
correspondence school.

Fresh Anderson had a girl up to the game the other day, and she asked him what inning it was.
She wins the diamond-studded cement-mixer.

Stitch this in your pipe:
Lord Salisbury and Chesterfield had a Lond Life and a Pall Mall with the Blue Boar at Piedmont. After meeting
Herbert Tarreyton in Cairo they mounted a Camel and rode to the land of Egyptian Dieties. Prince Albert lent them
a couple of Tuxedos and Brown’s Mule and they capped the Climax by making a Lucky Strike with Fatima, an
Indian Maid. “Though I am only a poor Fatima,” she lisped, “I am not a Beech-Nut.” Both lords enjoyed the
Duke’s Mixture, but decided that rather than become Strollers they would leave their Cubebs. So they made a Home Run
to the Old North State, settled at Edgeworth’s, and lived in Velvet forever after.

Witness: “Slightly back of the center, sir.”

because he might lose his right?

We suppose women are called peaches because the more you handle them the mushier they get.

Said the Flapper: "The only thing sadder than the man without a country is a country without a man.”

“Ma, can I go out to play?"
“What, Willie, with those holes in your pants?”
“Naw, with the kids across the street.”

She: “Do you drink to me only with thine eye?”
He: “Yes, I have a glass eye.”

It is reported that Austin got his wide operatic experience from playing the nut in “Ben Bolt.”

Buck Shaw says that a Fresh at his table has such a big mouth that he gets crumbs in his
ears every time he eats bread.

Fresh: “Morgan Speir pitches on the baseball team, doesn't he?”
Soph: “Hardly. The only thing he ever got over the plate was a fork and his chin.”

Answers to last week’s questions:
- A cube is one-half of a crap game.
- An obtuse angle is one that doesn't get the slant of things.
- A Hudson Bay seal is a muskrat that has taken up typewriting and gum-chewing.
- The man with an Iron Mask was not a baseball catcher.

Attention of All Plum Eaters!
Hebe Mellwaine says that his football men run him to death getting into practice for the prune-eating contest, and Melton
or Sutton, Tomeat Baker, stand the best chance of winning, having so far been able to get on the top
side of thirty. This doesn't come up to Linda-mood's record last year, which was 47 per meal. Though they are
a dirty bunch, the bath-taking contestants are now running neck and neck, the score stands one all, in favor of
Webb. Mr. Shelby, take your time.

Play by Play Report of Game Arouses Boys
Exciting Time Enjoyed by Big Crowd at Gymnasium

It was an enthusiastic crowd of students that paid their quarters and crowded into the gym to listen to the
play by play return of the Davidson-Furman game and to follow the ball up and down the field as chalked
upon the board by Jim Carr. Jim, always an artist with the chalk, wielded the red, blue, orange, and white
limestone to mark the progress of the ball, each color representing either a punt, forward pass, line plunge, end run,
or kickoff. Shorty Howell, on the receiving end of the telephone, relayed the messages from the operator on to the
crowd perched about the front of the board. The crowd was as enthusiastic as if it had been right on
the sidelines instead of a hundred and fifty miles from the playing field. Time after time Shorty had to signal
for silence in order to get the next message, and time after time the crowd rose to its feet and
cheered. When Popsy raced twenty-five yards down the field and again when the “thin red line” held on the three-yard
line, all emotions were unleashed and every fellow yelled encouragements to the absent team.

Promptly at twelve o'clock the returns started coming in and late comers missed the play in which Furman blocked a
punt in Davidson's territory and one of her men scooped it up and ran for the only touchdown of the
game, coming as it did in the early part of the first quarter. This was the signal for the yelling
and every time a Davidson back made a good gain or a Furman man broke through our line, the fact
was registered either by the faces of the men or by the noise they made. Everybody was either thinking or
saying, “Fight 'em Wildcats,” and in the next breath, “Stop that Herlong.”
