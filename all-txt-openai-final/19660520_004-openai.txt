Long Illness Compels Retirement By Beaty

As a result of a severe heart attack early in the school year, E. A. Beaty will officially retire from teaching at the end of this year. Beaty has taught at Davidson for 41 years and for some time before that at the University of Tennessee. During his career, he has taught five languages: Latin, Greek, German, Italian, and English. Beaty says that he is still an “invalid” but is “doing much better.” He spends most of his time reading, mainly history, at his home in Davidson.

He graduated from Davidson, earned master's degrees at South Carolina and Columbia, and received his BD from Columbia Theological Seminary. He has spent two summers in Europe and has studied in Rome and at the University of Munich. Beaty was very upset at a recent article in THE DAVIDSONIAN which said Davidson professors do not often participate in politics. He pointed out that he was mayor of the town of Davidson for 20 years before Mayor F. L. Jackson was elected. He is currently listed in Who’s Who in America. He termed himself “very conservative” when asked of his opinion on the recent change in Vespers and drinking rules at Davidson.

Council Discusses Plan Of Traffic Enforcement

The Student Council evaluated the proposed change in the system of traffic enforcement and approved tentative plans for a program of student assistance in the Admissions Office at its weekly meeting Monday afternoon. The Council examined and then simplified the point system recently proposed for Davidson's traffic program by a committee of Assistant Dean of Students Tom Covington. The proposal, “designed to reduce the administrative and clerical work involved in student traffic enforcement," was sent back to Covington’s committee for further work.

Second Vice-President Tom Earnhardt outlined the proposed student admissions assistance. Under the plan, the Student Council would assist in high school “College Day” programs, substituting for faculty members, and would establish public relations teams to speak on college life in high school assemblies around the state.

An amendment to the Constitution calling for annual election of cheerleaders will be presented to the student body next fall. The Council voted to try to change the present set-up in which a cheerleader, once elected, serves until he graduates. Davidson will have no applied math department next year due to the retirement of Professor E. A. BEATY.

Covington Discusses New Union

Tom Covington, assistant dean of students, will become assistant director of the Union next year. He will fill the position vacated by Sterling Martin, who will become assistant track coach. As assistant director of the Union, Covington will be involved with Union activities, placement, and student extracurricular activities in general. His administrative relationship with fraternities, however, will remain the same.

Part of the reason for the change is a result of his work with fraternities. Formerly, all student activities except fraternity activities were centered in the Union. Covington handled fraternity business from his position as assistant dean of Students. Now all student activities can be handled through Covington in his new position with the Union.

“The purpose of this change,” said Covington, “is not to absorb fraternities into Union direction, but to enhance fraternity activities with what the Union can provide. I feel that this arrangement will be more effective.” The resources of the Union should now be more available to fraternities, he continued. “I'm enthusiastic about the move,” said Covington. “I feel that we can certainly do at least as well as we've done in the past, and probably much better.”

Lesesne To Head Next Year's ODK

Louis Lesesne was elected president of Omicron Delta Kappa Monday night as the honorary leadership fraternity completed its elections for next year. Other officers elected were Bill Rikard, vice president, and Paul Marion, treasurer. The group also initiated the nine juniors and seniors inducted in the spring tapping.

Chaplain Cancels Vespers Service

The Chaplain’s Office has announced that there will be no Vespers service this week. Open house in faculty homes, which usually follows Vespers, has also been cancelled. Chaplain Will Terry had planned to speak Sunday evening. Terry has been out of town during most of this week due to an illness in his family.

Mebane, who has taught at Davidson for 43 years, said, “No one else will teach the course, so the only applied math offered will be a computer course under Dr. (J. H.) Roberts.” Mebane will spend his time “traveling, fishing and continuing my private surveying work.” He has done “all the engineering work for the college in the past 15 years” and is especially proud of the new baseball field. At Davidson, he taught physics and pure mathematics before taking over the applied math course. He wants to buy some of the equipment from the school and says the rest will go to the physics and maintenance departments. Mebane graduated from Davidson and has studied at VPI, Cornell, and the University of Chicago. During World War II, Mebane worked for two years on the Manhattan Project in Chicago as a research scientist.

A lot of people believe that someday computers will do all their thinking for them. You're going to have to start thinking! Well, a funny thing is going to happen on the way to the future: think problems connected with their harder and longer than ever. Computers can't dream up things like Picturephone service, Telstar® satellite, and some of the other advances in communications we have made. Of course, we depended on computers to solve some of the practical way to lock a door or turn off an oven by remote telephone control, or to make possible some of the other things we'll have someday. It takes individuals... perhaps you could be one... launching new ideas, proposing innovations and dreaming dreams. And someday, we're going to have to find a way to dial locations in space. Makes you think, development. But computers need absolutely clear and thorough instructions, which means a new and tougher discipline on the human intelligence. And it will take more than a computer to create a pocket phone the size of a matchbook, let’s say... or find Bell System American Telephone & Telegraph and Associated Companies
