**New Photography Lab**

By Amoura Carter

Davidson College is now the proud home of a brand new photography lab, which recently opened in the basement of the Visual Arts Center. Completed at the end of January, the lab features a digital photography lab and a darkroom, allowing students to work with their photographic medium of choice. Photography Club members, including past co-presidents Annie O’Donnell ’08 and Kealy Devoy ’08, worked tirelessly to bring the darkroom to campus, a welcome addition for photography enthusiasts and novices alike.

Current Photography Club co-president Rachel Berry ’08 commended Devoy and O’Donnell on their initiative in bringing the lab to campus. “Kealy and Annie spent the past year putting hours and energy into securing the space for the photo lab and proposing the budget,” Berry said. “They also spent time working with the art department, Ars Longa, Bobby Vagt, and the physical plant to finish this darkroom.”

Berry, along with fellow co-presidents Tim Casper ’08 and Sarah Coffey ’09, wasted no time in getting students acquainted with the new facilities. Last Saturday, Casper and Coffey held an orientation session to familiarize students with the digital and traditional labs. Casper taught the digital portion of the orientation, which introduced students to the $8,000 state-of-the-art digital computer programs and equipment, funded by the President’s budget. The digital lab program, called Aperture, runs on an iMac G5 that features dual screen flat monitors, a touchpad for editing photos, and scanners for prints, negatives, and slides. Though the lab lacks a printer due to financial constraints, students can save their work on compact discs and print elsewhere.

In the second part of the orientation, Coffey showed students the darkroom and taught them the specifics of traditional photo development. The darkroom is equipped with all of the necessities for developing black and white negatives and prints, including metal reels, canisters, a negative washer, and a drying box for recently developed negatives. It also features two black and white enlargers and a selection of photo paper in various colors and sizes. The lab contains a print washer, which recycles and filters water as students rinse out their prints. This piece of equipment should help reduce water waste. The Photography Club also has a Canon Rebel 35mm camera available for student use, and Coffey is currently selling black and white film.

**Ready, Set, Serve... A Night for Hinds’ Feet Farm**

Dim lighting tinted the guests in gold, gemstones glittered in their table settings, and the essence of champagne hung in the air. No one had yet impaled himself examining a Zulu war spear, one of the items up for auction. The Checkered Ball was running smoothly.

I became involved with this black-tie dinner and silent auction through Hinds’ Feet Farm, a burgeoning non-profit in Huntersville that offers long-term residential care for people who have suffered a traumatic brain injury (TBI). For the past 15 years, the ball has raised money for the National Brain Injury Research Treatment and Training Foundation, but this year all $200,000 went to Hinds’ Feet Farm, its sister organization.The Foil family, in honor of Philip Foil, the brother of director Martin B. Foil, II, Hinds’ Feet Farm aims to provide a facility for TBI survivors that incorporates full-time professional care with activities designed to mentally and physically stimulate residents. Hinds’ Feet differs from other facilities because of its emphasis on engaging residents with each other and the community to create a sense of home and belonging.

I initially became involved with the farm to assist with public relations. Many other Davidson students and student organizations, such as Rusk, CoHo, and Sigma Phi Epsilon, had volunteered there in the past. I was interested to see what the farm offered. The first day I arrived, Martin B. Foil, III, Marty for short, gave me a tour of the grounds. I saw the site where the main residence and greenhouse would soon be built. In the main house, which has since been constructed, residents will be able to visit with family members and dine together. Marty hopes this will encourage them to spend more time with each other and less time alone in their rooms. Though this building is now complete, Hinds’ Feet is still in the construction stage and currently has no full-time residents.

I decided to expand my role at Hinds’ Feet by volunteering to collect and organize auction items for the Checkered Ball, which took place on Jan. 28 at the Westin Hotel in Charlotte. I assigned an auction number to each of the donated goods, which included everything from a baseball autographed by Joe DiMaggio to a live puppy. On the day of the ball, I arrived early to help set up auction items in the gallery. From the time the 430 guests arrived until they left for the evening, I raced about to ensure their contentment and to check on the 15 student volunteers from Davidson. After dinner was served and awards given out, we carefully moved auction items to a back room to keep them from wandering off or breaking until the highest bidder had paid. Complaints were few. No one even noticed when the puppy had an accident. It was a night to be remembered and, hopefully, to be repeated.

Lab opens in VAC

Photography Club co-presidents Tim Casper '08, Rachel Berry ’08, and Sarah Coffey ’09 with their state-of-the-art digital computer equipment. Students who attended this weekend’s training session now have CatCard access to the photography lab until 1 a.m., but are prohibited from using the other facilities in the VAC unless enrolled in another art course. Berry, Casper, and Coffey plan to hold weekly office hours in the photography lab so that interested students can learn more about film development and proper use of the new equipment. The Photography Club presidents urge students to e-mail them with any questions, comments, or requests for assistance they might have in conjunction with use of the lab or photography in general.

Davidson College students have five drinks or less per week.
