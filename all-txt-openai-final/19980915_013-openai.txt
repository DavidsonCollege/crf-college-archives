THE DAVIDSONIAN

ARTS & LIVING

TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 15, 1998

Virgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22)
This is your week! A surprise visit results in financial gain. Next week will suck, though.
Lucky day: Thursday

Libra (Sept. 23-Oct. 22)
Be proud and hold your head high as you walk through the Commons this week. Especially after you drop your
tray on Tuesday.
Lucky food: cheeseburger

Scorpio (Oct. 23-Nov. 21)
Don’t worry about what you said to that girl on First Night Down. The bruises will heal.
Lucky Dept.: Poli Sci

Sagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 21)
Friends and family applaud your efforts, say “You are inspiring.” Then they talk about you behind your back.
Lucky Dean: Shandley

Capricorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19)
Your professor tells you to meet with him this week. Don’t get sidetracked watching The Price is Right. It can
happen.
Lucky network: The WB

Aquarius (Jan. 20-Feb. 18)
You will struggle to complete a huge undertaking late Monday night. That is, if you're on the Davidsonian editorial board.

Pisces (Feb. 19-Mar. 20)
You decide to attend the new step aerobics class at 8:30 pm. You have a great time.
Lucky appendage: left arm

Aries (Mar. 21-Apr. 19)
You will be quick to belittle the Davidsonian for printing horoscopes. Then, you will be run over by a truck.
Lucky spot: Watts 113

Taurus (Apr. 20-May 20)
Lose some of that Taurus stubbornness and be the first to say “I’m wrong” in an argument on the 18th.
You’re wrong, anyway.
Lucky publication: Libertas

Gemini (May 21-June 20)
Study hard for that big review! Your efforts will pay off if you get away from the email and hit
the books.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)
You decide to do something worthwhile with your time, so you see Schindler’s List at the Union.

Leo (July 23-Aug. 22)
You will do something that you enjoy this week. I’m not sure what it is. I can’t tell you everything.

Going to a concert?
Write about it.
