Students Help in Cleaning Up Interstate Trash

Seniors Susan Majors and Marcy White directed the Davidson Environmental Action Group's highway clean-up effort this Sunday, which occurs four times a year during the school year. Approximately 50 students and staff members gathered 65 bags of trash on the three-mile stretch of I-77. Said Majors, "We were happy with the turnout. The clean-up was really successful." The next clean-up is in the spring.

Davidson's efforts to clean up trash and recycle are alive and well because of plastic bins provided by the college.
