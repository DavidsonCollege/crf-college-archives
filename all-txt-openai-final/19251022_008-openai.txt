A. H. Currie, the president of the student body, wrote an inspiring letter in the first copy of the Davidsonian urging all freshmen to get into the spirit of things. We notice that the football team played some of the leading universities of the south, and the student body was right behind the team just as it is this year. In that year our present laundry plant was installed. This was a great help to the boys, for they had been limited as to the amount of clothing that they could have laundered theretofore. At that time, only half the students could take their laundry on Monday. The other half would take theirs on Wednesday.

Dr. Frazer Hood, well-known psychologist, came into the Davidson faculty to occupy the C. E. Graham chair of psychology. Dr. Hood is off this year taking university work. Dr. E. J. Erwin, an honor graduate of Davidson in 1906, also became a member of the faculty to assist Professor Shewmake in English. This place he holds today.

The enrollment was so large that the chapel exercises were held in old Com-

(Continued from page 2)

Davidson had a total of 375 yards, or an average of 375 yards per game.of 37% yards, while Davidson punted eight times, for a total yardage of 223, or an average of 28 yards. P.

Davidson led in the ground gaining, a total of 37% yards. However, P. C. punted ten times, for a total yardage of 223, or an average of 28 yards. P. C. tried five passes, two of them being incomplete, one intercepted, and two completed, for a gain of 25 yards, while Davidson tried 12 passes, seven of them being incomplete, and five caught, for a total gain of 50 yards. P. C. suffered one five-yard penalty, while Davidson received three five-yard penalties, and one two-yard penalty. 

For P. C., the work of Hogref cannot be spoken of too highly. He hit the line and circled the ends for substantial gains, and it was he who started P. C. on their drive for the touchdown, by a pretty 33-yard run. Neighbors also showed up well in the line, smearing plays time and again, and being a terror on offense. The work of Fewell and Owens was also outstanding. 

McConnell was the bright light on defense for Davidson, this plucky little end always keeping the plays in, and making a majority of the tackles. LeFerve was also a strength in the line on defense, few plays being run over him. On offense, Kell and Flinn were the outstanding ground gainers, while Wenburg ran back punts for 15 to 20 yards practically every time. He was especially adept at dodging the ends and circling the tackles. Kell made the longest gain of the afternoon, getting loose on an end run for 44 yards. 

The following is the line-up:
Davidson. Position. P. C.
McConnell LE Pierce
Kolb LT Beekman

Don't forget class basketball. The Seniors won the first game, but the Juniors were in there every minute. The Freshmen, of course, are an unknown quantity, and unless they develop something unusual, the best bet is on the Senior class.
