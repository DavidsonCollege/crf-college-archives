6 THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER 14, 1931

Book Review:
Leonardo Da Vinci, Dimitri Merejkowski. Random House, New York.

Leonardo Da Vinci is a work that marks Merejkowski as a master in the art of letters. The reader need not be surprised at the finished touch that prevails throughout the volume when he takes into account the fact that during his teens Merejkowski’s mind was impregnated with mysticism and even at such a tender age he had already written much poetry. Now as to the work itself. Space prohibits the use of quotations, and therefore only a few of the excellences of the book may be referred to. It presents a vivid picture of the life, manners, and customs of the Middle Ages. Leonardo is indeed a veritable pageant, full of pomp and splendor. It is brimming over with sly, crisp humor, a quality rarely found in the historical novel. The reader gets an intimate picture of one of the most remarkable men since time began. You realize that you are finding out secrets about the great, the wise, and the unusual people of that era. Men of various stations in life during this time come to life in your imagination and pass before your mind’s eye, causing your fancy to run rampant. One comes to better understand the Borgia, Michelangelo, and the princes, popes, and martyrs of this period. Leonardo has many parts that are really poems in prose—like Cassandra’s visit to the deserted isle temple of an unknown god. Another high spot in Leonardo is the description of Walpurgis. The translation was done by Bernard Guilbert Guerney directly from the original Russian and is the only English version in existence. Undoubtedly Merejkowski’s novel deserves a high place among the great historical novels and it will be well worth your while to read the delectable pages of this interesting work.

Barboursville, W. Va.—A youth who came off a farm to enroll as a student at Morris-Harvey College and who brought a two-year-old steer, five bushels of potatoes, and 30 bushels of apples along with him to pay his school expenses, was a full-fledged student today. The steer was butchered and the potatoes and apples were in the college storage bins for use in the cafeteria.

The Gossip: “I hear your store was robbed last night. Lose much?”
The Optimist: “Some. But it would have been worse if the yeggs had got in the night before. You see, yesterday I just finished marking down everything 20 per cent.”—Detroit News.Mild and ripe, the best that money can buy. Blended and cross-blended is like making a new and better-tasting kind of tobacco, with greater smoothness, more mildness, and a more pleasing aroma—a fragrance and flavor not to be found in any other cigarette. CHESTERFIELD gives you the benefit of all the world knows about the production of cigarette tobaccos—both Turkish and domestic. Chesterfield tobaccos are mild and ripe, the best that money can buy. Nobody smokes a better cigarette than Chesterfield. © 1931, Liggett & Myers Tobacco Co.

Unusual Tribute to Late Mr. Wilson
Washington—An unusual honor is paid to the late Woodrow Wilson here. In memory of his life in the capital city, BKO-Keith’s theatre unveiled and dedicated a memorial plaque marking the box occupied by him. President Wilson enjoyed vaudeville presentations and was a regular patron at Keith's theatre during the later years of his failing health. People familiar with conditions and public men of that day recall scenes about that show house on the nights Mr. Wilson appeared. Crowds stood in the streets and watched him go in and come out, while hundreds attended the performances just to see and admire the great World War statesman.

White man’s stolen the Red man’s land,
Where Lo once was he ain't,
But the college youth retains his yell,
And the flapper has his paint.
—Boston Transcript.

Gentleman—Are you married?
Teacher—You remember the story of Daniel in the lion’s den, Robbie?
Robbie—Yes, ma’am.
Teacher—What lesson do we learn from it?
Robbie—That we shouldn’t eat everything we see.

The atlas of the Great Elector of Brandenburg, Germany, said to be the largest book in the world, has been restored to its former beauty. The book is 66 inches high, 39 inches wide, and weighs 275 pounds.

Dr. H. L. Donovan, president of the Eastern Kentucky State Teachers College, has charged that selling of teaching appointments and giving them to relatives exists on a large scale in the state.

DR. ROBERT W. MILES (Continued from page 1)
Alabama Polytechnic Institute at Auburn, Ala., for three years after he left the Seminary. From that place, he went to his present pastorate at Lynchburg. His church is very popular with young people and attracts large numbers of them at every service. He is active in the civic life and affairs of his city, and last summer was accorded the honor of being sent to Europe as a delegate to the convention of Rotary International.

CHARLOTTE MINISTER IS HEARD IN LECTURE (Continued from page 1)
The matter with Davidson campus tonight? Everyone gone somewhere. Why? He doesn't know. For what? Just to turn around and turn back. We just love to go. As St. Augustine said, ‘Our souls are made for God and are restless until we rest in Him.’

“He was a dilemma that is common today. He lacked a soul. And when he went away, he lost the greatest opportunity of his life. The modern church would have welcomed him into its midst. He would probably have been a deacon or an elder in a very short time. But Christ could look through the man. He saw not God, but gold on the throne of his heart. There is nothing wrong in riches; they become objectionable only when we are overpowered with a restless worship of them.

“This experience is the experience of every young man sooner or later. It must be realized that all discipleship is costly. Christ must have first place in faith, love, service, conduct, and character. This experience is not unique, for upon it depends the success of discipleship in Jesus.”
