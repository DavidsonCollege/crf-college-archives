PAGE FOUR THE DAVIDSONIAN

REST AT LAST!

night as puzzled on-lookers stare in astonishment. Moffitt’s rather unconventional behavior resulted from a disagreement with roommates. (Photo by Andy

things very necessary for a winning team. The Kittens drilled long and hard for their game with Furman today and
were at top shape at game time. The only man to miss today’s game was Ken Lawing who will be
out for about 9 weeks on injuries received last weekend at Chattanooga.

Davidson will also be counting heavily on the backfield services of Jim Thacker and Leroy Fargason. Thacker, the scat-back who
brought the crowd to its feet last week with a brilliant 70-yard kickoff return, is making a strong bid for
repeat honors on the All-Southern Conference grid squad. Fargason was a thorn in the Wolfpack's side all night. Repeatedly, he
ripped off big gains through the State line. Shifting into the power slot of the Notre Dame box, Fargason is
a demon at line thrusts. Fans will see a lot of that big “53” tomorrow. He will get a lot
of help from Harley Smith who played a fine game against State and will probably be starting at the right
halfback slot.

the college administration and the manner in which it might be made manifest. Most of us welcome the advice and
guidance of the older and more experienced in matters of religion. To us the lessening of this advice and guidance,
which seems the logical implication of independence, would be a loss to be lamented rather than a gain to be
applauded.

Beaver Club Plans...

acting as secretary-treasurer of the organization. One of the Beaver Club’s chief boosters is the assistant director of athletics, A.
Heath Whittle. Coach Whittle, who has been a prominent figure on the athletic scene here for a good many years,
is highly complimentary of the organization and feels that they “have really done an excellent job.” To confirm his statement,
he points with pride to numerous letters of appreciation from visiting teams, who cite Davidson's hospitality as the best they
have encountered anywhere. Thus the Beaver Club strives to extend to our visiting athletes the friendly spirit which is so
distinctly Davidson's. Membership is limited to the sophomore and junior classes. When a member reaches the status of a senior,
he is automatically retired. In April, twelve members of the rising sophomore class will be elected to membership.

This year’s Beaver Club is comprised of the following men:

Juniors—Ish Bennett, Henry Brown, Corky Clark, Charlie Cousar, Dickie Davis, Floyd Feeney, Lacy Keesler, Frank Mitchener, Scotty Reems, Edson Weeks
and Jim Thacker.
Sophomores—Hobby Cobb, Dick Adams, Bo Abernathy, Harold Davis, Perrin Anderson, Billy Morris, Jim Shelton, Jim Daughdrill, Jim Patterson and Phil
Koonce.

Ish Bennett's passing led the Phi Delts toa victory over the Phi Gams, Clyde Robinson also passed and ran for
the winners. It was Don Reed and Charlie Hall who led the losers.

Pikes 18; Phi Kapps 12
After losing one in the last minute of play Monday, the Pikes came back to win in extra-time over a
very determined Pi Kapp squad. It was the running and passing of Bill Hanna that spelled victory for the Pikes.

ART PROGRAM HEAD VISITS DAVIDSON
Miss Norwood Baker, director of the Arts Program of the American Association of Colleges, visited Davidson last Tuesday to confer
with members of the faculty and administration about possibilities for bringing varied and unique artists’ programs to the campus. Among
those who conferred with Miss Baker were President John R. Cunningham, Professors Abernethy and Moore, Dr. Sam Spencer, and Union
Director Shaw Smith.

out to right the South’s economic evils was forced to leave his native state and was hated by many of
his countrymen for pointing the way to the faults of a system that could not, and did not, long survive.
Perhaps we cannot stand in easy awe of such a man who took a point of view that seemed so
opposed to the Southerners. It was through his foresight and brilliance that he saw a situation clearly for what it
was and did not lack the courage to point it out to his fellow men even though doing so meant
taking an unpopular stand. He does, however, hold a certain right to our respect and admiration for what he did.
Especially should we remember him as some of his roots were so closely connected with our college.

PROOF of LOW NICOTINE. HIGHEST QUALITY
The country’s six leading cigarette brands were analyzed—chemically—and Chesterfield was found low in nicotine—highest in quality.

A PROVEN RECORD with smokers
Again and again, over a full year and a half a group of Chesterfield smokers have been given thorough medical
examinations... the doctor’s reports are a matter of record, “No adverse effects to the nose, throat and sinuses from smoking
Chesterfields.” A responsible independent research laboratory super-vised this continuing program.
