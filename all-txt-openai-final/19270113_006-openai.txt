“Y” Column

Literary Societies

At the beginning of this year the “Y” wishes to make for itself a resolution, to become in every way a greater and more helpful part of the campus life of Davidson. To do this the “Y” officers wish to invite and ask the aid and co-operation of the entire student body, in order to make the coming months the most successful that the “Y” has ever enjoyed. A most commendable and profitable phase of work was carried on in the vesper services during the fall and early winter months, and a great part of the success of the meetings was due to the wise selection of speakers and leaders. Carrying on with these vespers, the “Y” is now trying to bring some of the best-known speakers in the state and the South, to lead during the spring months. Among those who will probably be here are Josephus Daniels, Mrs. Daniels; Bishop Mikell, of Atlanta; Hon. Max O. Gardner and Hon. Clyde R. Hoey, both of Shelby, N. C.; Judge T. B. Finley, and others. In view of such excellent leaders the “Y” can expect a most enjoyable spring campaign.

The “Y” plans to have a check tournament, preceding and during exams, the winner of which will be given a prize consisting of a certain number of free admissions to the movies. The games will all be played in the “Y” rooms, which provide a very comfortable place for such contests.

Next Sunday Union Theological Seminary will have charge of the “Y” service, bringing no doubt a special quartet and other features that will make a worth-while program. Anybody who wishes to have interviews may see any member of the group. An exhibit of Union is now being shown at the “Y”, including pictures of the buildings and faculty of the institution.

Harry Goodykoontz went as Davidson's representative to the Student National Conference, held at Milwaukee, from December 28th to January 1st. Harry reports a wonderful and inspiring conference from which many new and helpful ideas were to be gained.

In the early spring the “Y” hopes to put on what will be an entirely new thing in the South. This will be a Vocational Guidance Institute, at which leaders in particular professions will address and advise men about choosing their profession, giving expert advice to the real facts about their own. Davidson “Y” hopes to set aprecedent that will be a beneficial one, and one that will thrive in other years.

“THEY SHALL NOT PASS” (Continued from page 4)

And then there is the other side of the question to be considered—the bill itself. Members of the council readily admit that there is a feeling of hostility toward them in the student body. The student body is assured, at the present time, however, that in the final analysis the power is theirs if occasion shall so demand its employment, no such feeling. Regardless of the opinion of the student body concerning a matter, they as a student body will have nothing to say concerning the question. Nothing can go further than the senior court, that there has been an error in the decision of the first court. Under the proposed plan there will be accepted by the society. Crinkley upheld the affirmative of the former question with Phillips as negative speaker. The decision committee, composed of Ratchford, Mauzy, and Frew, voted two to one for the negative. In the second debate, Hamilton for the negative shout out, with a judges’ decision of three to nothing, very timely and humorous arguments presented by J. C. Fry. Both subjects were well handled by the speakers.

Pandemic
The Pandemic Literary Society held its first regular meeting after the holidays on Thursday night, January 6th, in their hall, with a very good attendance. After the meeting was called to order, Bailey conducted the devotional exercises, offering prayer and reading Proverbs 4. New business was then entered into, during which it was decided to have a feed the first meeting after examinations, which is February 3rd. The meeting was then taken up with the election of officers to serve the second semester. Nominees and elect are as follows: For president, McAlpine and McIlwaine, McAlpine being elected; for vice-president, Falls was unanimously elected; for secretary, Graham, Hill, W. E., Bradley, and Cox, with Bradley being elected; for first critic, McCutchen, L., and Webb, McCutchen being elected; for second critic, Arbuckle was unanimously elected; and for sergeant-at-arms, Milton, Beavers, and White, Beavers being elected. It was then decided that these officers-elect would be installed at the next meeting. The society was then adjourned.

Dear Editor:
I have bought some mushrooms, but am afraid they might be toadstools. How can I tell the difference?
James Calligan.

Answer—“Don't worry. Simply cook and eat them. If they are toadstools you'll never know the difference.

Lieut. Wall—“Ah-Ha, need a shave.”
Pvt. Dresback—“Tee-Hee, lost my razor.”
Lieut. Wall—“Boo-Hoo, ten demerits.”

Boy! The result of such a situation will be none other than to augment and elevate the feeling of hostility toward the council, especially will this be true in the two lower classes. Several months ago there was a discussion on the campus concerning the proposal for not allowing the freshmen to vote in student affairs until they returned in the fall of their sophomore year. The dean of the college stated that if such was done the result would be harmful to the college in that the lower classmen would feel that they had no part in the government. The present case is highly analogous to that of not allowing the freshmen to vote. And then comes the question as to whether the senior class is more capable of deciding such cases than the student body as a whole. Such a stand will, of course, be taken by the proponents of the bill, though there is considerable doubt as to whether they will admit it to the student body. But that is far from the question. When one appeals a case it is with the thought that the higher court is more capable, but it is through the contention that there was an error. Thinking that there was an error, it would be absurd to ask the same court to find or admit that error, so the accused man must appeal to another and higher court. At Davidson, that court has for years been the student body. For years sophomores, juniors, and seniors have voted, with the addition of the freshmen after their January elections. For years the members of these classes have all been considered competent to act as a final court. My opinion is that such should remain the case at Davidson, and, if the faculty demands that we meet at night, then let us meet at night rather than yield to this encroachment upon the rights of the student body.
