Pussyfooting

It’s about time the administration stopped pussyfooting around and started plans for the garden behind the Honors College. Time and time again we've been promised the garden, but so far all we’ve received is a bronze plaque dedicating it to some alumnus. It’s about time this administration started working on things that are necessary around here rather than fooling with such trite issues as subsidized football and the funding of the library.

One of the problems holding up progress on the garden has been the fight between the faculty and Vice President for Academic Affairs John M. Bevan over whether to plant Zambidians or tuberous rooted begonias around the Cohen statue. In a faculty meeting yesterday, debate lasted three hours thrashing out this question. A committee was formed to work out the controversy.

Another blockage occurred over the necessity of brick sidewalks throughout the virgin land. College President Samuel R. Spencer Jr. had ordered bricks for a serpentine wall around the garden, but Student Body President Ralph Peeples protested saying it smacked of elitism. We hope that these important points will be worked out as soon as possible. Davidson’s future hangs in the balance.

Libertine Speaks

In the past several weeks, THE DAVIDSONIAN has received several letters criticizing the editors and staff of this paper of grossness, impudicity, ribaldry, debauchery, lewdness, lasciviousness, aphrodisia, defilement, immodesty, venery and poor spelling. Not only that, but several have called the editor a loose fish, a deceiver, a Bluebeard, a rake, a debauchee, a lecher and a chartered libertine. Well, it just ain’t so! And because it is not the policy of this paper to print letters criticizing the contents of THE DAVIDSONIAN, we take this space to respond to our critics.

Several people have complained that certain parts of the paper are completely incomprehensible. We deny the charge. One example often put forth was the paragraph in our last issue on the soccer petition. It read: “The use of the petition according to Tournee is, ‘to show support for soccer as a basketball’.” Now what could be more clear than that? We are assuming of course that most people in this community do have an eighth grade education, though several Republicans have caused us to doubt that assumption.

Others have pointed to the example in our November 17, 1972 issue which read: “Comparing past teams with this year’s team, Severn commented, ‘there is a world. There is a great deal of spirit on the team’.” Now surely no one will deny that there is indeed a world.

Still others point to the bi-weekly unintelligible drivel of some guy named Wopple. This is indeed a weakness in the paper, and applications are now being accepted for new columnists. College administrators need not apply.

All in all we think many of our readers are being a bit unfair. We’re just a bunch of college boys trying to keep out of trouble. And we really aren’t trying to be vicious in our view of campus happenings. It’s just our environment. Davidson baffles science. With an environment such as this, how do people expect us to put out a newspaper? We roll each week from amazement to amazement to amazement. That is why we consider this to be a very special week. It’s one of the few in which the news it contains is believable. To all our critics we apologize for any injustices of which we are guilty. It just goes to show: Don't believe everything you read in THE DAVIDSONIAN.

A Review

Every now and then there is a Happening in the world of music that makes rock and roll worth all the day-to-day garbage being released. One such Event is the new underground classic recently released by Deity records. As true cultists may remember, Deity's first (and only) record thus far was the legendary Masked-Marauders disk. The band is made up of Donny Osmond, Yoko Ono, Michael Jackson, Mark Farner, Phil Spector and Terry Knight. They have a sound that approaches the style of Three Dog Night, but manages to maintain a funkiness the Doggies have missed on their latest releases. Spector plays drums (anybody remember the Teddy Marijuana Smoking Bears?)and Knight sticks to bass. Together they provide a solid support for Farner's searing lead lines. With the vocal freedom provided by three lead singers, “Turtle Mind” is able to cover a wide range of styles in every song. Often, Donny and Mike weave interesting soprano harmonies while Yoko screeches away in the background. The album opens with “My Way,” on which Donny does a superb imitation of Frank Sinatra, until the band really gets cooking behind him. Then Yoko comes in like either a skyrocket or a wounded pig and barrels the song into a tense emotional climax. The effect of the whole number is to leave you pressed against your chair rubbing your crotch in anguish. A real love song, that one.

Reporters Criticized

To the Editor:
I feel certain that my colleagues will agree with me that this “paper” is genuinely offensive. Not only are the editorials and articles idiotic, but your standards of decency and taste are revolting. Your staff probably smokes marijuana or LSD or “shoots in,” as they say, while they put out this trash. The only things that save most issues are the letters to the editor.

To the Editor:
I read your paper regularly and often wonder why.

To the Editor:
Why don't we ever hear about the patriotic activities of the Anti-Communists at Davidson? From what I read about Davidson politics, there must be quite a thriving throng of young men and women who are proud to stand up for what this country is, means, and does to anybody. It’s a good thing, too, because the faculty is already infiltrated as well as duped. (Especially a certain pinkish economics professor.) Incidentally, I was sorry to read that a certain beatnik “poet” who is a known RED and HOMOSEXUAL, as most liberals are, read his “works” at Davidson. Watch out. They're all around us!

To the Editor:
We wish to make it known that we, the English faculty of Davidson College, had absolutely nothing to do with inviting a certain beatnik “poet” to speak here. Not one of us had him into our class, nor did we attend his readings. Furthermore, none of us has read any of his “works,” and we wouldn't like them anyway.

Surprisingly enough, with two fine producers like Knight and Spector, all the production and mixing is done by multi-talented Canadian David Clayton-Thomas. Clayton-Thomas does an impressive job on his first effort from behind the big board, adding an air of nonchalance that approaches sloppiness to the undertaking. The opening cut is followed by a seven-minute rendition of “Ben” Jackson starting his touching love song in the usual manner, but then Farner again takes the lead line off towards outer space, sounding at times like he’s being eaten by the damn rat. The second side is a fifteen-minute jam on the title cut. Yoko starts the song with high-pitched screams, but then Donnie and Mike chime in doing a superb imitation of Captain Beefheart. The band really rocks on this one, which includes a special guest appearance by Duane Allman somewhere on track 97, I think. But all this comment would be superfluous without some mention of the showstopper: an a cappella rendition of “Deep Purple” including all members of the band. I refuse to believe (despite the liners stapled to the cover) that Spector didn’t have a hand in producing this one. For one, it’s done entirely in mono. It also includes a 500-voice choir of kindergarten students. It's great to think that in a world of supergroups and superstars, a group of talented people can still get together for a recording of special merit.
