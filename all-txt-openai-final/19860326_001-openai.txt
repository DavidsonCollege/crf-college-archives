**Sandy, Knight win SGA elections**

By ANDY BARRON

Junior Mark Sandy and sophomore Vincent “VeeKay” Knight won their respective races for Student Government Association president and vice president in elections held yesterday.

Both Sandy and Knight emphasized increasing the visibility of SGA on campus as a goal. As part of this attempt to increase SGA’s visibility, greater student involvement in SGA and its decision-making process will be encouraged.

“We will be considering ways for the SGA to better represent student opinion,” Sandy said. “It’s [the SGA] not going to be [based upon] my opinion. First we have to solicit accurately student opinions and then represent it to the faculty, administration and trustees.”

Knight emphasized the need for student awareness of SGA decisions and programs. He felt the students didn’t seem to know what SGA does. He hopes to “make students aware of the good things SGA does.”

Sandy’s goals as president include both maintaining the quality of annual SGA projects such as the Phonathon as well as developing new projects. He wants to get started this spring by addressing the current housing situation in light of the shortage of student housing, the condition of the dorms and the new lottery system. He intends to work closely with President John Kuykendall, Dean Will Terry and Director of Housing Tom Jennings on this issue.

Knight also wants to address important issues immediately. “Issues like Self-Selection, Alcohol Policy and the concern for excessive student partying are in a cloudy stage,” Knight said. “I'd like these issues to move from this stage of uncertainty to being resolved.”

Sandy emphasized the broad range of important issues facing students and SGA’s willingness and ability to address these issues. “Groups [faculty, administration and trustees] are responsive to student opinion when it is well represented,” he said.

Knight intends to increase the visibility of SGA by increasing the visibility of his own office. “The vice president needs to become more involved in events around campus,” he said. “I hope to attend more campus events to increase the vice president's involvement and accessibility. I want the students to know I'm concerned and that they can come to me with their concerns. I also hope that SGA representatives are more visible so students know who to turn to with their concerns.”

**Vandals damage sculpture loan to school**

By KEITH FINCH

A $40,000 stainless steel kinetic sculpture, Four Open Rectangles Diagonal Jointed II, loaned to Davidson College by renowned sculptor George Rickey, suffered an estimated $20,000 in damages at the hands of vandals hours before it was to be returned to its owners on the morning of Friday, March 14. The sculpture had been on display in front of the Grey Student Union since the Davidson Horticultural Symposium on March 5.

J. Erik Christensen, sound and light technician, found the sculpture damaged that morning. He said that the damage to the sculpture was extensive and could not have been caused by the wind. “One of the two double sections had come completely off,” he said, “at first it looked that if the pin were to have come off, the wind could have flung the piece down into the rocks below the sculpture and driven it into the ground to bend it. One of the large sections was bowed and bent, and there were a number of dents along its surface. But the other section that had not come off also had a number of deep dents. Also, the clinch pin was not damaged, but appeared to have been taken off or pulled off. The wind couldn't have done that.”

Christensen added that he did not think that high-speed winds could have moved the sculpture fast enough to damage it. “In high winds it would align itself with the winds and spin gently.”

He also said that the nature of the damage seemed to rule out the possibility of accidents. “I don't know if somebody hit it with a rock or with a hammer; I also can't see how it could have gotten bowed the way it was. The dents...”
