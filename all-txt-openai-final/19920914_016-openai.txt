UPDATE

V USA Today ON-LINE DAILY
Read today’s USA Today on any terminal which can access CHAL. At the menu, simply select USAToday. Select the date of the paper you want, type ENTER, select the section, type ENTER, and you're reading today’s paper. Type DIR/NEWS to select another section. Type EXIT to end the session. The Library has more detailed instruction sheets.

V KEY-WORD INDEXING FOR PERIODICAL DATA BASES ON CHAL.
Key word searches are available on the eight periodical indexes which are on CHAL, thanks to three new disk drives added to the Library’s computer, LITTLE, during the summer.

V INTERNET ACCESS TO ON-LINE CATALOGUES OF OTHER LIBRARIES
Make your selection at the menu, select the library, and then follow the instructions of the host library. Not all libraries have the same software as CHAL, so read the directions on their screens carefully. It can be a bear to operate, but it also can be worth it.

V DOWN-LOAD YOUR CHAL SEARCH TO DISK
Using a PC or MAC, searches may be downloaded to your own disk. Remember: if you push “dic” from the key word search (for books or magazines), CHAL puts the search in correct format for your bibliography.

V “ASK CHAL” ON-LINE SUGGESTION BOX
Have an idea which would make the Library better? Know a book the Library should have? Want to know about something regarding the Library? Select Suggestion Box on the menu, then type SUG at the next screen, type your question, and you will get a “CHAL GRAM” on-line to your APOLLO account.

V MICROFORM READER/PRINTER
A second Minolta 606zp reader has been added on the ground floor. It does everything but read the article for you.

V MARCIVE
All of the U.S. Govt. Documents which the Library receives dating back for ten or fifteen years will be added to the CHAL data base. When you ask CHAL to find information on a topic, it will look for books and government documents. ETA: October.

V AUTOMATED CHECK-OUT OF BOOKS
Last summer the staff put bar codes on each of our 385,000 volumes. During second term we hope to have a test group use the system in preparation for everyone using it in the 1993-94 school year.

If you have any trouble (CHAL-wise!), give us a call at Ext. 2158 or drop by the Reference Desk.
