Upcoming DO trips hope to pull students outdoors

By CARA WOODROOF

Davidson Outdoors has many exciting trips planned for this semester. Ranging from kayaking and fly fishing to backpacking and caving, DO trips take students off campus to beautiful destinations in the mountains, streams, woods, and even seaside, from West Virginia to Florida.

Don’t be intimidated, though. People of all skill levels can participate in any of the trips planned this semester. For the beginner fly fisher, for example, the trip to Little River in North Carolina, running Sept 14-16, is the ideal mix of sport and tranquility.

Novice kayakers may participate in the Beginner Kayaking trip Oct 4-7. At the beginning of the trip, participants learn the basics in the swimming pool, followed by a venture to the Lake Campus to learn more maneuvers before finally testing their skills on North Carolina whitewater over the weekend.

Backpackers can enjoy the Pisgah Backpacking trip Sept 21-23. This trip takes participants to what DO President Howell Burke calls, “North Carolina’s most beautiful country” for “two days of fun” and “two cool mountain evenings.”

If you want to backpack but prefer to skip the overnight camping, there is a great opportunity with the October 27 day hike to a local mountain range.

The Via Ferrata and White Water Rafting trip running Sept 28-30 offers an exciting trip to West Virginia’s “rugged crags.” Even beginners can climb there, thanks to the various cables and rungs already on the cliffs. On Sunday, participants raft down the Gauley River.

The Mount LeConte Backpacking Trip running Oct 12-16 is a safe getaway to the Great Smoky Mountains. The trip promises “spectacular views and autumn leaves” and a one-night stay at the LeConte Lodge, which boasts “some of the world’s most delicious hot chocolate.”

Also running October 12 through 16 is a Sea Kayaking adventure in Georgia. Participants “tour the marshes, estuaries, and barrier islands of Georgia,” while learning more advanced kayaking skills.

Rock climbers of all levels can sign up for the trip scheduled Oct 19-21. Participants learn basic skills Thursday evening before they hit the climbing ranges of Pilot Mountain State Park.

Advanced cyclists can enjoy the Distance Road Cycling trip Sept 14-16. Cyclists pedal 100 miles on a bike route from Seagrove, NC to Morrow Mountain. And, if your thighs are not on fire by then, you can cycle all the way back to Davidson.

The last trip of the semester is the caving trip to Christiansburg, Virginia, running Nov 17-18. Participants venture through both the Pig Hole and Links caves in Virginia. All participants must attend a mandatory rappel training and safety class beforehand.

In addition, DO offers a trip to the Everglades lasting Jan 5-12, just before the spring semester starts. Participants “canoe from key to key, camp on warm sandy beaches” and go on a wildlife search.

Burke emphasized that he and other DO leaders want to get more people involved. Their goal is to see the trip registration full for each excursion. If you don’t have any equipment, DO can fully outfit its participants for almost all trips. In addition, much of the cost of excursions is covered by DO. Costs for participants range from $10 to $200 and cover everything including meals, equipment, instruction, and transportation.

Burke also observed that the trips are a chance to make “real, genuine relationships” — relationships that can be experienced and enjoyed in ways more meaningful than “at some party somewhere.” If you’re interested in attending any of these trips, stop by the DO office in the basement of the union for more information.
