FRIDAY, APRIL 17, 1953

As this writer takes over the position of the editor of the sports page, we feel it only fitting and proper to congratulate the retiring editor, Dick Roper, on a job well done. Dick brought Davidson sports fans a fine coverage of Wildcat sports events, as well as many extras and opinions of interest to the reader. We are well aware that because of the length and nature of this column, it is not the most popular part of the page, but we will attempt to bring you discussions and views which will point out to the fan areas of the Wildcat sports life not contained in the news stories. This is exactly what we feel has been done in the past year by Dick, and speaking on behalf of a lot of your readers, we would like to say—Thanks, Dick.

SPRINGTIME IS FOR SPORTS

This is truly the sports season here at Davidson. With four varsity sports in season and one other winter varsity sport in their spring training periods, the sports life on the campus will reach its peak during the coming few weeks. The phenomenal thing as far as the usual Wildcat sports outlook is concerned is that three of the four teams now in intercollegiate competition are sporting records of .500 or better.

Coach “Pete” Whittle’s track team has a 2-1 record with two decisive wins and another of those old Davidson moral victories. “Pete’s” boys walloped Roanoke and Mercer, but Wednesday the field events gave them a fit as Clemson took a heartbreaker 66-65. The cinder pounders will hit what is possibly the toughest competition they will meet this season as they face loaded South Carolina both today and next Saturday.

Out on the tennis courts, the Cats are doing just as well. The flashy netters have won 8 while losing only four. Coach McKee’s charges will hit North Carolina’s defending Southern Conference Champs next weekend in one of the toughest and most looked-forward-to matches of the season. North Carolina is favored again to take the Southern Conference Tournament which gets underway on the local courts on the 14-15-16 of May. Tennis fans are looking forward to the meeting of the two teams because it just might be indicative of the May meeting of the conference. With men like Del Silvia and Herb Brown on the opposition, the Cats will have their work cut out for them.

FEATHERS WILL FLY SAY GOLFERS

The other winning team in the Wildcat “hope” chest is Coach Elgin White’s Linkmen with a 5-5 record. Though losing badly to South Carolina this week, the Cats are really gunning for the Gamecocks in their Tuesday meeting. All the rest of their regular season matches this year will be played on the Charlotte Country Club course.

The only dismal scene on the Cat horizon at present is over on Coach Chuck Clements' baseball diamond. In his first year as head baseball coach here at Davidson, the amiable Clements is working on a building program which should reap some diamond victories for the Cats in future seasons. This sounds like the same old “building season” excuse that so many coaches hide behind when things don’t go as well as they had hoped as far as winning goes. However, this time it’s a fact. Just look at the lineup. Only three or four seniors figure prominently with the regulars, including pitchers.

THEY’RE INEXPERIENCED, BUT IMPROVING

At times the infield has been protected by three freshmen and only one senior and by other combinations including two juniors. One of the freshmen, Buzzy Hope, is one of the team's leading hitters and all three excel in fielding ability. In the outfield, there are two juniors, one of whom is Fred Stowe, last season's leading hitter. On the pitching staff, there is only one steady senior, a junior, two sophomores, and three freshmen who have shown promise. When they gain some much-needed experience and a little confidence—watch ‘em.

Yet another sport is laboring in spring practice sessions. Coach Charlie Parker’s wrestlers worked out early in the week (getting ready for Spring Frolics), but adjourned activities last Wednesday because of the dance weekend. Some eight men are taking part in the spring drills as the Cat groaners look forward to some wins on next year’s slate.

44 Phi Delts Become New Volleyball Champions; Lead In Tennis Tourney

By DON PILKENTON

The Phi Delta Theta Fraternity opened strong and finished the volleyball season going away with an 11-0 record. The loss of the previously unbeaten SPEs to the Phi Delts last Monday fairly well decided the championship. Thereupon, the SPEs went on to lose one of their remaining two games and wound up in third place behind the KAs. The champion Phi Delt team was built around Scott Reams, 1952 All-Fraternity Volleyball player. Although the Lynchburg Virginian had no former experience in the game before entering Davidson, Scott’s natural abilities were brought forth last year and have continued to show themselves throughout this 1953 season. Scott’s role on the All-Fraternity Volleyball team is likely to re-occur this year.

Nelson Captain

Captain Bill Nelson, a Robbins N. C. Junior, who also served as coach, aided the success of the team in the careful placing of his players to ensure a well-balanced group, on both offense and defense. In offensive play, Nelson, Gene Craven, and John Alexander were the play-makers, while tall boys Scott Reams, Buddy Brown, and Tom Poindexter sent the ball over the net. The powers of the Phi Delt defense who helped save many a point were Dan Leach, George Whisman, and Pete Ormsby.

Two Third Games

Evidence of the team’s sparkling play may be seen in the fact that, of the eleven contests they played during the season, in only two was a third game required to determine the winner, the Phi Delts having won the first two games. The spirit and confidence, built up through the season by a continual stream of victories, gave to the team an added punch which proved them champions in the tight spots. Although the Phi Delts possessed two or three stand-out players, the ball fell also into the capable hands of teammates who contributed no small portion of the talent which brought their team through a perfect season. The one or two remaining volleyball games which were postponed will not affect the standings of the first three teams.

In the tennis circuit, after three weeks of scheduled play, the Phi Delts are leading. However, their 8-0 record is being challenged by the Kappa Sigs with a 4-0 record and the Campus Club, with two wins and no losses. Due to postponed games between the Phi Gams and the Campus Club, Pi Kapps and Betas, Phi Gams and SPEs, Campus Club and ATOs, and the Kappa Sigs and the Betas, this week’s tennis standings are incomplete.

Baseballers Seek Season's First Win At Durham Tomorrow

By JIM HOLSHOUSER

Davidson’s Wildcats travel to Duke tomorrow where they will meet the current leaders of the Southern Division of the Southern Conference. The Cats, with a lineup sprinkled with freshmen and sophomores, are still seeking their first win. The Davidson nine played host to the Blue Devils in the opening contest of the season and came out on the short end of an 11-2 score.

Smith Goes Monday

Johnny Smith, mainstay of the Wildcat mound staff, will start the game against the league-leaders. Monday afternoon, Davidson will play the McCrary Eagles, one of the strongest semi-pro teams in North Carolina. The pitching chores will fall on Roger Little or Jimmy Smith. Following the game with McCrary, the team hits the road for a series of Southern Conference contests. They will meet North Carolina, N. C. State, The Citadel, and South Carolina on the trip.

Busy Week

In the past week’s competition, the Cat nine met Furman, North Carolina, and Clemson, with the latter being a double-header. Although the team lost the two games at Clemson, hopes for the future were stirred by the outstanding pitching performance of Johnny Smith. Against the strong Tiger club, which has lost only three games, Smith struck out sixteen men! During this second game, several outfield flies were lost in the sun, letting unearned runs cross the plate for Clemson. The result was a close 6-4 loss for the Cats. The hitting of the team has been poor in these last few games, with only eleven runs being scored in four contests. Arnold Whisnant, Fred Stowe, and Buzz Hope have been the leading hitters, with Jim Teeter, who left the Furman game with a badly twisted ankle, also looking good at the plate.Seasonal standings of the volleyball teams and the Inter-fraternity tennis season standings through the third week of play are listed below:

**Cats Meet Gamecocks Today**

**WILDCAT LINKSTERS 'TEE-OFF’ TUESDAY WITH GAMECOCKS**

Next Tuesday, Coach Elgin White’s red and black golfers will meet a powerful South Carolina Gamecock crew on the Charlotte Country Club links. The Cats will be out for revenge for the 20½ to 6½ pounding they took at the hands of the South Carolinians this week. With Graeme Keith back in the Wildcat lineup after an excursion to the Greenville Open, the Linksters are out to turn the tables on the Gamecocks. The match will begin at the usual 9:30 a.m. in Charlotte.

**Split Even**

The day before the South Carolina loss, the Cats took the measure of the four-man Furman outfit by a 13½ to 4½ count. Joe Jenkins and Larry Parrott led the Cat win as they both shot 76s. Low man for Davidson in the Gamecock match was captain Lew Barnes who shot a 76. The season record for the golf team now stands at 5-5 with but three matches left in the regular season. The two matches left after South Carolina Tuesday are with Clemson on the 25th and Wofford on the 27th. On the 14-15-16 of May, the Cat golfers will travel to Winston-Salem to take part in the Southern Conference Tournament to wind up the golf activity for this season.

**Wildcat of the Week: Johnny Smith**

**Struck Out 16 Tigers; Still Couldn't Shake Off Cat Jinx**

Last Friday was just another in a stream of dark days for Chuck Clements’ still winless Wildcat baseball team, as they bowed 6-3 to Clemson in the second half of a doubleheader. But for the guy laboring for Davidson on the mound, it was one of the biggest days of his baseball career. That afternoon saw an easy-going, drawling Davidson junior named Johnny Smith strike out sixteen Clemson batters while giving up eight hits in the course of the game. But, to his chagrin, Johnny still lost the game as his teammates were unable to bunch enough of their eight hits in one inning to eke out a victory.

Smith’s performance against Clemson was all the more outstanding since that school has one of the most highly subsidized — and therefore one of the best — teams in the South. The Tigers report 14 freshmen on scholarship and a traveling squad of nearly 30 players.

**One-Sport Man**

Smith, from Lillington, North Carolina, is strictly a one-sport man at Davidson, having been out for the diamond nine all three of his years here, but last Friday was easily his best individual performance. Johnny will probably have trouble doing a repeat performance of the Clemson game, but he would undoubtedly consider winning a game for the Cats more of a team effort.

**Thinclads In Columbia After Heart Breaker**

The track team is in Columbia, S.C., running the University of South Carolina cindermen in one of the toughest meets of the season for the Cats. The meet was run on the Gamecock home track this afternoon. South Carolina has a well-balanced team and many veteran lettermen, and Coach Whittle considers this one to be the season's toughest meet. After the South Carolina-Citadel meet, the Cats will travel to the local track for a triangular meet here next weekend. After the South Carolina-Citadel meet, the Cats stay at home for the remainder of the season as they meet Washington & Lee and N.C. State on successive weekends here. They will travel to the Southern Conference Meet in Durham on the 15th and 16th of May.

**Clemson Loss Heart Breaker**

The Cat cindermen lost a real heartbreaker last Wednesday afternoon at Clemson as the Tigers edged them out 66-65 in as exciting a meet as is possible in the cinder sport. Clemson took first and third in the 220 low hurdles to clinch their victory. The Cat cindermen made almost a complete sweep of the running events while the Clemsonians did the same in the field events. The Tigers grabbed eight firsts to the Cats' seven; seven seconds to the Cats' eight; and seven thirds to the Cats' five. It was really nip and tuck down to the 220 low hurdles. The Cats' undefeated mile relay team took that final event with a 3:32.1 time to pull the Cats back to within one point.

**Shipley, Henry Undefeated**

Davidson’s two top contenders remained in the ranks of the unbeaten as Bill Shipley ran his best time in the 440-yard dash with a :51.2 and Captain Bob Henry again took the 880-yard run with a 2:02.6 time. Other Wildcats who captured firsts were Phil Koonce in the 100, Homer Sparks in the mile, Floyd Fagan in the two-mile, and Bob Poston in the pole vault. The Cats last Saturday trounced the invading Mercer University tracksters by a decisive 96-35 count. The Cats’ record now stands at two wins and one loss.

**Neimen Tangle With Powerful P.C. Tomorrow**

Coach Dick McKee’s Wildcat netters tuned up for next week's tough competition by trouncing N.C. State 9 to 0 Tuesday afternoon at Raleigh. Saturday afternoon, the Wildcat netters will invade the land of the Gamecocks to match racquets with the University of South Carolina team.

**Cats Seek Revenge**

The big test, however, will come next week when the Cats again tangle with a strong P.C. combo. The Wildcats will be out for revenge, having suffered their worst defeat (7-2) at the hands of the Blue Hose. The Wildcats have been steadily improving over the course of the season and present a threat to any team which they tangle with on the courts. The P.C. netters are one of the strongest teams the Wildcats will meet this season, but if Johnny Bremer’s sprained ankle has healed, Johnny and Lacy Keesler, Davidson’s top men on the courts, could very possibly lead the Wildcats to an upset victory.

**Keesler Tops**

Keesler has been the steadiest of the Cat performers to date and Coach McKee hopes to see his sophomore ace go all the way in the Southern Conference Tournament which gets under way on the local courts on the 14th of next month. Bremer has been greatly hampered by his weak ankle which he sprained during the first of the two Harvard matches. He saw limited action for over a week, but the weak ankle is now back to its normal playing strength and he should hit his regular No. 2-man game against the Gamecocks tomorrow.

**Given some support, Smith should prove himself the best of the Wildcat pitching staff before the season is over. Johnny’s biggest trouble is control; when he can put the ball where he wants it, he’s capable of breezing it by the other team pretty consistently.**
