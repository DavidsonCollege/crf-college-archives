GOV. T. W. BICKETT

ed in the world had been a dream or visionary before it became a reality. Upon his arrival in Davidson
last Sunday at 5:30 p.m., Governor Bickett immediately went to Dr. J. M. McConnell’s home, where he was entertained during
his short stay in Davidson. Following the Governor’s address to the Y. M. C. A., at 6 o'clock, he returned
to Dr. McConnell’s home where supper was served. Those present and enjoying the hospitality of Dr. and Mrs. McConnell besides
Governor Bickett were: Dr. W. J. Martin, Dr. J. W. McConnell, Miss Mary Parks Grey, and C. J. Matthews, of
Davidson, and Miss Elizabeth Bruns, of Charlotte. After supper, Dr. and Mrs. Lingle and Dr. Harding called to spend the
evening. After a very enjoyable evening, Governor Bickett left in his car for Charlotte.

SPLENDID BANQUET
(Continued from page 1)
by John L. Price, the Louisiana Vampire. J. M. Richards, the cute little nightingale from “Hell Alley,” was then asked
to give a brief resume of the history of the class of '22 thus far. In a very able manner,
Mr. Richards convinced everyone that the present Sophomore class is as good as the best by showing what she has
already done and what she intends to do. According to the speaker, about fifteen new men entered the class this
year because of the record made last year. It is hoped that this is only an index of what is
to come. Following “Secretary” Lacy, the only bugler in this country who blows by note, Mr. Rolston Bitzer then talked
on the subject, “What the Class of...

The class is well represented in the following phases of college activities: football, basketball, literary, social, and religious. Pech e
that he had convinced all of standing of the class Mr. Bitzer took his seat to allow Photographer McIlwaine to
advise the men against dissipation through the medium of a joke. The class then offered a rising vote of thanks
to Mr. Pat Gilchrist and his capable “assistant” for valuable services in preparing the banquet. Mr. Gilchrist deserves a great
deal of credit for the success of the evening’s entertainment. Toastmaster Knox told of an amusing conflict of Brice, Gilmer,
and Hamer with Col. Sloan in which these three were slightly “horsed.” Mr. Hamer was then allowed to speak in
his own defense. The speech of the evening was delivered by Dr. J. M. McConnell, of the Faculty. The Doctor
admitted that this was one of the pleasantest and most enjoyable of the numerous class banquets he has attended. In
a very earnest and forceful manner, he told a joke and then gave the class some excellent advice and encouragement.
Some of the values of a college education were enumerated, and the address was then concluded by an expression of
appreciation for the pleasure of the evening and with best wishes for great success for this class both now and
hereafter. Mr. C. E. Cunningham was then asked to give the toast to the class of ’22 which had been
written by D. L. Mahood.

“If you want to win
And it's time to begin,
Just have your name inscrolled
With the leading men
On field or with pen
Who follow the Purple and Gold.

“So here’s a toast to the Sophomore Class,
To her we'll all be true.
For the class we'll love from first to last
Is the class of Twenty-two.”

Several announcements were then made, after which the men stood and sung the college song, O! Davidson! This concluded the
exercises officially and all are agreed that the affair was a success from every viewpoint.
