After missing last week’s Family Weekend festivities due to road contests, many of the members of Davidson’s volleyball team had
the chance to play in front of their parents this weekend. Although the Wildcats fell to rival Furman in five
games on Friday night and to powerful Georgia Southern on Saturday afternoon, the team expressed satisfaction with their performance.

After the weekend matches, sophomore Latisha Chapman said, “I am proud of how the team pulled together and played this
weekend. It’s never fun to lose, but we all commented on how this weekend was one of the hardest fights
we have put up all season.”

Friday’s match was one of the most exciting of the year, as the host Wildcats (11-16, 8-9) gave the visiting
Furman Paladins (14-10, 10-8) all they could handle, 24-30, 30-24, 30-21, 23-30, and 15-12. Down two games to one, Davidson
responded in the fourth game behind the duo of junior Roberta Quis and freshman Meredith Lorenz. After opening with a
large lead, the Wildcats watched as Furman crept within two points of them, 19-17. Quis and Lorenz notched consecutive kills,
however, and the team forced a fifth game. In the deciding game, the Wildcats held a one-point lead, 12-11, but
Furman scored four consecutive points on serve to steal the game from the ’Cats’ grasp.

Coach Tami Darwin said after the game, “This was a tough match to lose. But I was very proud of
the way we played, coming back from a 2-1 deficit.” Quis added, “This match clearly shows how much we have
improved. In our first encounter with Furman, we were defeated quickly in three games. The entire team felt really good
about the match and it could have gone either way.”

In the match, senior Jacqueline Ortega led the team with 18 kills and Chapman followed with 15, while Quis provided
19 digs on the defensive end.

Only 15 hours after their near-win, the Wildcats took to the court again, this time against Georgia Southern. Just as
in the Furman match, the squad captured the first game. Their valiant effort, however, was not enough, and the visiting
Eagles prevailed, 23-30, 30-24, 30-28, and 30-24. The match was a gut-wrenching, back-and-forth affair, especially in the pivotal third game.
With Davidson holding an 18-15 lead, the two teams dished out the longest rally of the game. A sliding Tamara
Gallen kept the point going as her hand barely slid between the ball and the hardwood. After a solid set,
Meredith Lorenz emphatically ended the point with a kill. Despite such effort, Georgia Southern answered with some outstanding plays of
its own and fought back in Game 3, catching the Wildcats at 20-20 and eventually winning. The fourth game also
was hotly contested, but the Eagles had just enough to escape with the victory.

In the match, Ortega registered a double-double (20 kills, 11 digs), Lorenz made 19 digs, and Chapman accumulated 8 blocks.
After the weekend’s games, Roberta Quis commented, “Everyone played exceptionally well. The match against Georgia Southern proved that we are
right up there with the top teams. This weekend was a confidence booster.”

**Wildcat wrestlers take to the mat for the community**

By Amanda Mordavsky
Guest WriterSmall town like Davidson, children often look elsewhere for heroes. For those with ambitions of wrestling, however, they need
not look farther than Baker Sport Complex and the Wildcat wrestling squad. It was at Baker that these student athletes
brightened their young fans’ lives by hosting a clinic and exhibition this past Saturday. Over 160 children attended to meet
their favorite Davidson wrestlers and learn basic wrestling takedowns and pins. Head coach TJ Jaworsky and assistant coach Marty Fajerman,
along with Steve Dunlap (Jaworsky’s high school coach), led two technique sessions, in which the Wildcat wrestlers assisted. Following the
informational sessions, the Wildcats were scheduled to compete in a ranking match. The match consisted of two contests, with a
victory for sophomore Adam Sperling over senior Ryan Owens, and a tie between senior Jeff Liberstat and sophomore Mark O’Hair.
Due to injuries inflicted upon senior Jeff Bender and sophomore Charles Washington, the match was called early. The day ended
with a reception for all those in the community involved in wrestling, including faculty, former coaches, and alumni. Jaworsky concluded
the day with a display of the history of Davidson College wrestling from its conception to the present. Overall, Jaworsky
considered the day an accomplishment. “The team worked their tails off today,” he commented. “The clinic was a great success
for the publicity of Davidson wrestling.” Hopefully, Davidson’s success is just beginning. Although the regular season doesn’t start until December
1, when Davidson hosts Anderson, the team will be at several invitationals, beginning this Saturday at the West Virginia Open.
Despite some minor injuries from the exhibition, the future looks bright. The 11-man squad, led by seniors Bender, Owens, and
Liberstat, are showing great promise. Bender remarked, “We’re working harder than ever, and our coaches are giving us loads of
attention and support. It’s been a fun season so far.” Jaworsky agreed, “The team is really growing and counting on
each other. I am very proud of them. They are giving one hundred percent, and their hearts are great.”

SAAC hosts holiday toy drive

There’s more than sports on the mind of Davidson’s Student Athletic Advisory Council this winter. The SAAC will join with
the United States Marine Corps’ Toys for Tots program to coordinate a campus-wide collection of toys for underprivileged youths. On
November 11, the SAAC will place donation boxes in the Patterson Court houses, Alverez College Union, team locker rooms, and
other prominent campus locations. Davidson students and faculty will then have until December 3 to fill the boxes with toy
donations. On December 4, the college’s donations will be displayed at the men’s basketball game against Elon University to encourage
donations from the Davidson community. After the game, all donations will be collected by the Marine Corps and prepared for
their holiday destinations. The SAAC hopes to elicit a large response from both the college and the town. Griffin Myers
’03, Service Chair for the SAAC, said, “I think it will be a great way to get athletes involved in
the community, and the benefits of the collection will help out many people over the holidays.” He urges everyone on
behalf of the SAAC to donate generously.

The Student Athletic Advisory Council is a body composed of at least two representatives from each varsity athletic team and
is co-chaired by Greg Schernecke ’03 and Sarah Otto ’02. The Council meets every other week throughout the year to
express and act on the concerns of student-athletes in the college community. For more information about the Toys for Tots
drive, contact Griffin Myers at x5843.
