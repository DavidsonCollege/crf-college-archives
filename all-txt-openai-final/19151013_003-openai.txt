ALUMNI NOTES.

The friends of Mr. J. W. McNeill (’09) of Ragland, Ala., will regret to hear that on October 3 his

house at the time.

An effort is to be made this winter to strengthen the Alumni Association in Jacksonville. The above men furnish quite
a sufficient nucleus around which to work for a bigger, better, and stronger D. C. Alumni Association. The following D.
C. men areAt the University of North Carolina this year: T. C. Harper, who has before been mentioned in Tor
Davinsontan as taking his M.A. in Economics; Ed. Carter (’15), studying law; “Grandma” Phillips (ex-'15), studying medicine; Douglass Bullock (ex-'15),
studying medicine; Avon H. Elliott (’19), taking the doctor's course also; “Shine” Metcalf (ex-'17), taking academic work in preparation for
medicine. It is of interest to note that “Shine” has become a member of the A. T. O. fraternity. Lee
Mullen (ex-'17), taking pharmacy; “Dr.” John Cook (ex-'16), studying law. W. (“Doub”) Kerr, an ex-Davidson man and graduate of the
University last spring, is enjoying a fellowship at the University of Chicago. Dr. Robert H. Crawford (Davidson ’10, Hopkins '14)
has just returned from Germany, where he was connected with one of the large base hospitals on the Eastern frontier.
He had a valuable term of service as through his hospital about 2,000 wounded passed weekly, during the fierce advance
into Russia. Most of the wounded reached the hospital in an infected condition, the wounds not having had a dressing
for several days previously. Sixty-five percent recovered, however. Bob attended church with the Kaiser and said that Emperor Wilhelm looked
worried, which is no more than natural when we consider what his enemies are trying to do to him.

A wedding of considerable interest to the student body was that of Frank Stough (ex-'16), of Cornelius, N. C., and
Miss Allie Warshem, on the evening of October 6. The bride was a student at Elizabeth College in Charlotte last
year. After the ceremony, Mr. and Mrs. Stough left for a short trip North.

MAGAZINE OUT SOON.

The first issue of the Magazine is coming out on the 20th of this month. The Magazine is going to
be larger this year than it has been heretofore, as it will be issued only four times during the year.
The staff has been very busy for some time getting the material in shape and this first issue promises to
be a good one. F. H. Smith, the editor-in-chief, made a trip to Atlanta during the past week to make
final arrangements for the issuance of the Magazine.

Special invitation to all.
