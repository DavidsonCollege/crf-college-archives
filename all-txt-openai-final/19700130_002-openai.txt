A House That’s A Home

The administration has shown a bit of hidden wisdom in its selection this week of Marvin Sparrow as the new director of housing. Seniors remember the guidance which he offered during his career as a hall counselor; underclassmen can look forward to a glorious beginning in the Sparrow administration. Always a man of ideas and novelty, Sparrow has offered a marvelous idea for the development of the college into a communal state, in which all students are equals.

The program will accomplish goals many-fold. Not only will it centralize students (something to rally behind), but it will offer constant means of employment of student talent (something to do). The cost of the college will be reduced considerably, and the school will be able to offer once again financial aid to meet the student need. This will help us to get away from the middle-class stigma.

There are so many implications of the appointment which cannot be measured at this time. Only time will reveal the numerous innovative ideas which Sparrow will bring to the Davidson College community. At last, someone has found the solution to the age-old complaint about the quality of the school’s student housing. If this is any indication of the Decade of Destiny, bring on the rest of the show.

Setting Sites

We can only admire the way in which the Library Committee developed its list of priorities and followed deliberations. It is extremely fortunate that the student concerns and the plausible plans of architects tended to coincide, so that both interest groups could be satisfied to the fullest. The new library is convenient, and frankly, no one had expected the school to find a site that close to all.

Hidden Benefits

The honors college in its initial stages seems to be one of the most exciting developments in the history of the school’s curriculum. When fully developed it could present itself as one of the greatest drawing cards the school has to offer new students and prospective applicants. It is what education is really all about. It is learning in a new environment, within the confines of a completely new structure. It is excitement in curriculum. It is the embodiment of much of the good in education as well as an attempt at what is new.

What more remains to be said about a factor of the college which will be long-observed as one of its greatest assets? What else, except, perhaps... can anyone tell us, when does it begin?

In Memoriam

All of us on the staff were deeply touched by the untimely demise of one of our own, young Don Hoyt, who recently succumbed at the height of his budding literary career. Hoyt was really at the height, and still on the rise. Readers of THE DAVIDSONIAN will probably little note nor long remember his valiant stands against the mawkish, the boring, the garish, the untasteful, and stuff he didn’t like — in the world of arts and letters.

But one thing that few people realize about the “late, great Don Hoyt” was that art — and his work — were his whole life. He shunned the fake, the counterfeit, the execrable; instead, he went looking for the worthwhile and the non-execrable, but couldn’t find it anywhere. Hoyt’s parting words, “Just because it’s foreign doesn’t mean it’s good,” should serve as an inspiration to us all in these trying times. The editorial board surely speaks for us all when, by a vote of three to two (with two abstentions), it expressed “a moderately deep sense of woe” at his passing. He will be missed.

Quibbling

All we can say is picky, picky, picky. If the NCAA is going to get all upset about every little recruiting violation they run across, the sports world wouldn’t be a very nice place to live, would it? So what if Tom Stevens went a little out of his way to make sure some poor deserving high school swimmers got a chance at a college education. For humanitarian deeds such as these, he should be praised, not censured. It is just part of the Horatio Alger tradition. A boy has a talent and he develops it to give himself a chance to get ahead in the world. Does the NCAA really want to keep these deserving youths in their place without giving them a chance?

To punish Davidson College for living up to the American dream would seem to be uncalled for. As John Locke would say, the government has failed the members of the contract. Therefore, the contract is null and void. It may very well be time for Davidson to secede from the NCAA and unite with sister schools under the same yoke of unlawful government.

TO THE EDITOR

Touring Faculty Express Thanks;

To the Editor:

We would like to take this public opportunity to thank all the many public-minded citizens who have made possible our very enlightening and most rewarding tour of the Mint Museum. I am sure I speak for the whole group when I say it has broadened our intellectual horizons and has given us an inspiration which will not be long forgotten. Never once did we hear so much as a discouraging word.

We have many persons in particular to whom we feel we must express our heartfelt thanks: to Mayor John Belk, whose initial grant made the whole thing possible; to President Sam Spencer and his dedicated staff whose publicity photos and coverage have brought to the attention of the whole college community the importance of this adventure. And who could forget the devotion of our bus driver, who went the second mile when he picked each of us up at our homes in Davidson and carried us to the Mint Museum in Charlotte. And our thanks go last but not least, to the guides at the Mint Museum itself, who tolerated our penetrating questions without the least hint of embarrassment whatsoever.

Let us say in closing that we recommend this tour to one and all — be they students or faculty — both for its pleasant moments and its not so pleasant ones. We feel that we have seen, firsthand, the working of a

Exchange Coed Deceived

To the Editor:

After four years of finding THE DAVIDSONIAN outside my door every Friday, I feel compelled to write and say just how bad I think it is. It reads like an inside joke. I can never tell what is going on. And you guys take everything too seriously. Why don't you enjoy life? Do you have to complain about everything? The paper sounds like a gripe sheet. If you can’t saysomething good about somebody, don't say nothing (sic) at all. That's my standards. THE DAVIDSONIAN is just not fun reading any more. Shape up or ship out. I agree with Spiro Agnew. You guys are out of touch with the college, and you are biased, aren't you? Why, you even slant the editorials.

To the Editor:

I am writing this letter as a female transfer student to your wonderful campus. I am part of the Eight College Exchange Program, and I have found Davidson gentlemen to be of the finest character and hospitality. My stay here has been most enjoyable so far. But I do have one question.

Dean Claims That Hands Are Tired

To the Editor:

I am taking this opportunity to speak to the students of Davidson College at large through the pages of THE DAVIDSONIAN. To state it succinctly, my hands are tired. That's right, tired. It used to be that they were just "tied" by administrative rules which I had no choice but to enforce. Compulsory chapel, fraternity curfews, closed dorms, and the rest. Now I have to look for things to do. I'm sitting here twiddling my thumbs trying to think up new rules, but nothing comes to me. Oh sure, I have my share of work with people dropping out of fraternities and wanting to get their housing fee back. But I want to be a real dean! I'm tired of trying and getting nowhere. Well, have you ever tried to read National Geographic back as far as 1936? So I ask, please, if anyone has any problems—or any rules they would like to make up or have enforced—bring them to me.

To the Editor:

While there may be some people on this campus that think that I am just being the whole matter, I cannot go along with the idea that we really need a new library. What has happened to the good old days when students went to football games and basketball games and left the library alone? Riots, that’s what. The only reason most of these people want a new library is so that they can get more books and, you know that if we do get more books, well, with the morals of our country today chances are that over half of them will not be about religion or the American way of life. Protect the minds of the students.

In the transfer students’ catalogue, it says on the first page that I could enroll in an Honors College and not have to take so many required courses. Goodness knows, a girl has much better things to do with her time than spend it in religion classes!

To the Editor:

I think that the Davidson College student body should take heed to a word from the wise, which I had to learn the hard way. Here it is: If you're going to do away with something bad, just don't start it in the first place. Take those area exams. Please, take those area exams. If everyone had just done that... Oh well, what I mean is, we tried for a long time to come up with a workable program which would benefit the intellectual aspirations of the entire college community. By this method we would all learn to grow as men—intellectually, spiritually, and in favor with God and man.
