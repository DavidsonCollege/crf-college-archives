#### Commons fights for its right for freshmen

By MATT HOUSTON

Self-discovery is a very trying experience, a rite of passage for every young man and woman in America who goes to small, liberal arts colleges in North Mecklenburg County. At this important time, the thoughts concerning self-discovery are many and varied.

“Pistol Pete” McIntyre, counterman at the Commons, had mixed feelings about the self-discovery system. “Everyone wants to get into an eating house, but they eventually come to the Commons. We get everybody at the Commons. Trouble is, they waste a year maybe in one of them coed, all-guys, all-girls, all-gay, all-ant, I-don’t-know-what houses.”

Sandy Jablonski, head of catering at the Commons, felt that self-discovery was a positive system but that it needed some changes. “It puts so much pressure on freshmen that I think is unwise. You're coming to college for the first time, and in just six months you have to make a very important decision. Do you go where all your friends are going, the Commons, or do you take an eating house which you know will collapse and leave huge debts for its members to pay off?”

Carleton Pritchard, head of the College Dining Service, had more positive feelings about self-discovery. “It’s fine, it’s excellent, the Commons can live with it perfectly. When all the eating houses on the court collapse, we’ll always be here to serve the young people.”

Some people feel that the present system provides too few choices for freshmen or others choosing a place to eat. Dean Reed, class of ’99 and head of the Union Cafe Interest Group, expressed these opinions about the choices. “First you have all these eating houses, and they’re all begging for members. But you know Patterson Court is doomed. Then you have the Commons. It’s like you have to brownnose the cashier just to get your meal card. What I’ve found is that a lot of people are tired of the snotty Commons and want an alternative dining service. Since the Union will move to Johnston Gym when the new sports complex is finished, the present Union can be expanded to serve a huge but cozy mob of students. The Union Cafe can be an alternative which is open to all, unlike the Commons, and which is sure to attract all kinds of people.”

Mrs. Barber, head cook at the Commons, had very simple sentiments about self-discovery. “I cook, I clean. I can make a fine meal. When we have that to offer, who would self-discover the Court?”

Martha Junkins, assistant head at the Commons, felt that the conflict between the Commons and the eating houses had been greatly exaggerated. “Naturally, people at the eating houses fear the Commons. The truth is that the Court and the Dining Service can complement each other. Some people will always want to be abused during the spring term of their freshmen year, so they’ll always pick the fraternities. Other people will want to avoid meats and other fattening food, so they’ll pick the women’s houses. Still others will want the study breaks offered by the coed eating houses. That’s fine, since we only offer study breaks during exam week.”

Lee Tollentino, purchasing manager at the Commons, felt that the Commons was itself threatened by self-discovery. “By the time people self-discover, they’ve already gotten bids. It’s too late for us to get them. So I say we ought to give bids. This past week, I gave a few out just to try. They took it!!! I tell them about the social life. They never knew!!! I tell them about the low cost. They love it!!! We need bids. Soon we get a national organization too!!!”

Jay Kim, head of the Patterson Court Council, felt that the situation of the Court was grim, but not unsalvageable. “The Court can survive if we pool all our resources. For instance, we could dissolve all the separate eating houses into one organization. We could compete with the Commons in size, and obtain economies of scale. Then each house would serve one course or one entree, and the students roam from place to place during a meal. PAX could handle dessert, SAE could deal with the meat entree, Rusk could handle salads, and so on. I’ve asked the Economics Department to explore the logistics.”

Lynda Daniels, editor of the Announcement Sheet, gave the benefit of her experience to this reporter. “The main thing is for freshmen to chill out. They should relax and not let self-discovery worry them. If they can’t get a meal card this year, they can always enter the Commons at another time. The rejection might even be beneficial. Forced to eat on the Court, they may like it there and stay. More likely, they will use their time outside of the Commons to learn from people’s failure.”
