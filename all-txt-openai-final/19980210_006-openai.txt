THE DAVIDSONIAN

Conference offers campuses various service opportunities

COOL Conference attracts service-minded students

On Mar. 12-15 at the University of South Carolina in Columbia, the annual COOL (Campus Outreach Opportunity League) Conference will
be held. This national conference meets every March to “bring together college students who are active in their community,” said
community service coordinator Bill Abrams.

Students come from approximately two to three hundred colleges and universities. Meredith Benke, a participant in last year’s Conference, said,
“In my opinion, it is the largest conference of its kind.” Abrams said that “by far, it is the most
educational national conference for students involved in community service.”

The Conference consists of three workshop sessions per afternoon, evening presentations, a State of the League Address about service, and
information sessions similar to the volunteer fairs at Davidson, where students can find out information about service opportunities.

At the sessions, volunteer organizations such as the Peace Corps present information. Students can also learn about summer internships and
semester study programs. Presenters of the workshops have included Michael Stoops from the National Coalition for the Homeless, and college
students such as Meredith Benke for Davidson’s Project Life.

Perhaps the most important aspect of the Conference is the students’ exchange of ideas. Brian Williams, a participant in the
Conference for the past two years, said that it is “really energizing to meet people from all over and to
see how they are doing the same things.”

Seeing what other campuses are doing for service and how they accomplish things helps to improve Davidson’s service programs. Two
programs brought to Davidson from the Conference include Into the Streets, which is a COOL program, and the Urban Plunge,
a National Coalition for the Homeless program.

Campbell said that the “little things, learning about how another college’s service program is organized” are also important in improving
Davidson’s programs.

Abrams and Campbell agree that the Conference reveals the size and range of the National Service Movement. Campbell feels that
it is “pretty powerful to meet all those people” and to see how many people participate in service.

Students interested in attending the Conference this year should contact Abrams (x2460) by Thursday, Feb. 12. The registration deadline for
the program is Feb. 15. There are already a number of people going, and Abrams said the program is “cool.”

Abrams “strongly encourage(s) anyone who wants to broaden (his or her) ideas about how to be involved in the life
of the College” to attend.
