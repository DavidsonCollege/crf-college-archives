**Love of Learning receives $15,000**

Money will support math and science classes

By RAFAEL SANCHEZ-ABALLI

Davidson’s Love of Learning Program, an innovative minority education endeavor working in conjunction with the Charlotte-Mecklenburg school system, has received
a $15,000 award from the Merck Company Foundation.

The award will be officially presented to the College on Friday, November 17 at 12:30 p.m. at the Afro-American Cultural
Center in Charlotte.

Davidson is one of ten private institutions receiving an award from Merck for its “innovative programs in undergraduate science education.”

Love of Learning selects 30 “promising” eighth-grade students each year who are performing below their potential and prepares them “for
admission to selective colleges.” The primary goal of the program is to inspire students to pursue Ph.D. degrees in mathematics,
humanities, and the sciences.

In addition to attending a month-long summer session at Davidson, students also participate in academic and social activities during the
academic year.

The program has established a system of support consisting of family, friends, and, most importantly, Davidson students.

According to Brenda Tapia, Director of Love of Learning, the award “will be used to support the math and science
components of the program.”

Stressing that there is a lack of minorities with Ph.D.s participating in these fields, Tapia wants to encourage students in
the program to seek the highest education possible.

**EVERYONE TALKS ABOUT CHANGING THE WORLD.**

**THIS YEAR 3,750 PEOPLE WILL ACTUALLY DO IT.**

Not everyone is cut out to change the world. After all, it takes education, skills, and a spare two years.
Also a willingness to work. Hard.

This year 3,750 Americans will join the Peace Corps to do just that. They'll do things like build roads, plant
forests and crops, teach English, develop small businesses, train community health workers, or even coach basketball. However, what they'll be
doing isn't half as important as the fact that they'll be changing a little piece of the world... for the
better.

And when they return, these 3,750 Americans will find that experience doing hard work will have another benefit. It's exactly
what their next employers are looking for.

So, give the Peace Corps your next two years. And while you’re out changing the world, you'll also be making
a place in it for yourself.

**PEACE CORPS**

You can't make the world a better place from behind a desk!

See the movie! Talk to a Peace Vet! Come to the Wilson Room of the College Union on Tuesday, Nov.
14 from 11 am until noon.
