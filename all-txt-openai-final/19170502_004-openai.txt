**Blue Ridge Swimming Pool**

**ON TO BLUE RIDGE.**

Back on a mountainside, affording a magnificent view of the Seven Sisters of the Blue Ridge, is situated the large and well-equipped main building of the Y. M. C. A. conference grounds, Robert E. Lee Hall. At this place, many students from colleges all over the South gather to learn of conditions elsewhere, to engage in discussions concerning timely topics, and to have a general good time in every way possible. Robert E. Lee Hall is situated just three miles south of Black Mountain, and together with other buildings in the grounds, affords to the visitor who goes there the comfort of a hotel, or of a genuine summer camping trip and athletic privileges in the use of the tennis courts, swimming pool, baseball fields, and other equipment in the athletic line. Mountain hikes are frequent to Greybeard, Pinnacle, Mt. Mitchell, and other places of interest in the neighborhood. Only a meager impression of what it really is can be obtained from the above picture. But greatest of all the privileges is the association with the greatest men in the religious world that the great Y. M. C. A. organizations represent. Such men as John R. Mott, Robert E. Speer, William Jennings Bryan, and Dr. W. D. Weatherford have been there and all have given their opinions in favor of it as the best thing of its kind around here. Think over it! If these men are not there, there will be some to take their places. Get ready! June 12-21. Definite information can be secured from any officer of the Y. M. C. A., and if you will count the cost you will find that you will get full value for every penny you put into it and, by the way, it does not take such an awful lot of pennies to go and have a good time, either. Ten days of pleasure and inspiration! What about having a large Davidson delegation? It pays, collectively and individually.

**ALL-STARS DEFEAT CRACK JUNIOR TEAM**

In a hotly contested game, a picked team (All-Stars) defeated the Junior class team on last Saturday morning by the score of 6 to 5. The All-Stars were unable to do anything with Lawson's delivery, backed with his strong infield; and it was not until the eighth inning, when Black went in the box, that they were able to get the pill through the infield to do any harm. Four runs were netted in this frame, which tied the score, and the winning run was made in the ninth. The Juniors were unable to land but few hits off Ormand, and but for several errors, the Junior’s scoring would have been considerably less. The Junior team worked beautifully, especially the infield, handling many chances with but one or two errors. Five members of the infield were “D” men. This speaks well for the Junior class. The All-Stars worked well only in spots. The line-ups of the two teams were:

**ALL-STARS** | **POSITION** | **JUNIORS**
--- | --- | ---
Keesler | C | Saunders
Ormand | P | Lawson, Black
McArn | 1B | Hengeveld
Johnson | 2B | Pharr
Dean | 3B | Black, Lawson
Boswell | SS | Wood
Flowers | LF | Watkins
McMillan | CF | King
Singleton | RF | Walker

The score by innings was:
- All-Stars: 000 100 041—6
- Juniors: 400 100 000—5

UNCLE EBEN’S LETTER.

Sometimes I think I hear you say
How slow you've been to write,
But jest remember how it am
For now's the time to fight.
Least that’s the way it peers to me
From all this military,
Jest fixing all these nice young men
Right for the cemetery.

“But jump right in for here’s your chance
To win this bloody fight,
We need right now the best you've got
To scrap with all your might,

“The enemy is pressing hard,
We've stood it all we kin,
And now that we must do the job
Come help us to begin.”

This is what they sed to me,
And you jes bet your life
I done forgot to write you, sis,
From thinking on the strife.

So here I go to do my best,
No matter what they say,
For they won’t dare to turn me down
Case I'll go any way.

R. E. M. '19.

WORK ON THE TANK PROGRESSING FINE

Work on the tank has been rapidly carried on the past week. The riveting of the huge iron belts on the frame of the tank proper, begun last week, will continue for several days. Scaffolds were early erected near the top of the steel supports under the bowl of the tank. This has been the seat of work. From early morning till night the regular tapping of the hammers on the iron belts has indicated the progress that is being made.
