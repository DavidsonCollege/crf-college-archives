“It was back quite a few years ago that Wake Forest College and Davidson met to determine the final standing
of the Big Five baseball conference. Davidson came to Wake Forest to snare the championship, and a defeat for either
team would mean the clinching of the flag for the other. Coach Phil Utley had been secured to act as
the officiator of balls and strikes.

“The early stages of the game found the Deacons rolling up a tremendous score. So when the ninth inning came
for the Davidson boys to do or die, Wake Forest was ahead 10-0. Fans were starting to leave the diamond.
They had a right to think that the game was over and that Wake Forest had won the championship. But
hang on gang, here is where the fun begins.

“With two men out, and only one game for the Big Five title, a little man steps up to the
plate with no one on the pond. He lets two go by for strikes. The next three pitches are balls.
The big pitch or the Wheaties special is due to go in. Coach Phil gets set; the batter takes a
look at the pitcher, and he reciprocates to the batter. The ball floats in and the batter starts toward first.
Coach Phil yells, ‘strike three, you're out!’

“Wake Forest had won the flag, but no, there seems to be an argument between the batter from Davidson and
Coach Phil. The Wildcatter claimed he had been robbed. Well, his story got into the smiling coach’s skin, and the
Dean of Deacon coaches broke down and gave him another chance. Coach Utley figured that since we were so far
ahead that the Wildcats couldn't possibly catch us. So once again the batter took a last cut at the ball,
but this time he got on the pond.

“And before the Deacons could stem the tide, Davidson had taken the championship right out of our hands by pushing
over 11 runs in the first half of the ninth inning. We were unable to score at all in our
half of the same inning.”

The story sounds good if it isn’t true, but we are in absolute concord with Mr. Philips in accepting the
story as accurate throughout.

Stolen Thunder
By DAYMOND TURNER

‘The Better Part...’

VALOR—to travel on an ocean liner without tipping anyone.
DISCRETION—to come back on a different boat.

* * *

Odd Ends...

Professors are those who go to college and never get out... A woman is like a can of paint—she has
to be stirred up before she’s any good, and she’s hard to get off your hands... Some nice girls are
popular, others don’t care who knows they neck... Mathematics is an exact science: which, by logical process, progresses from a
false assumption to an insane conclusion.

* * *

Heard...

Wake up—wake up quick!
Can't! Why not?
Ain't sleepin’.

* * *

Economy Note...

The same scientist who averred that Wisconsin co-eds use enough lipstick each year to paint a barn, now comes forward
with the following: The university heating system would use twenty-three less tons of coal this year, if students were allowed
to smoke inside the buildings. And the total energy content of all this tobacco is about 150,000,000,000 calories.

* * *

Co-Ed’s Lament...

I think that I shall never see
Another man as nice as he.
Oh, if his lips on mine were pressed,
And he would clasp me to his breast—
To feel his cheek against my cheek
And hear him whisper words so sweet.
Such men were made for movies, gee,
While only saps were made for me.

* * *

Why, Girls...

Girls at Sophie Newcombe, sister college of Tulane, recently decided that the old colonial and present Italian law of taxing
bachelors heavily would be a wise move in this country. The object of the law would be to make single
life so expensive for the man that two could live as cheaply as one. Claiming that marriage lies almost entirely
with the man, the Newcombites want a pension paid to all old maids.

* * *

‘Qui mal y soit’...

Dressed to kill in a coat of fur,
Lounging against a cocktail bar;
Baby, what I wouldn't give if you were,
One third as bad as you think you are.
—Blue Stocking.

* * *

Progress...

Little did the man who discovered time and space dream that radio and advertising men would soon be selling it...
An empty wagon makes the most noise... Fish and company spoil after three days.

* * *

Yea, Man...

“Watch me shake that thing,” said the elephant as he came to the suspension bridge... Fashion Note: There will be
little change in men’s pockets this year... “Just one more glass boys and then we'll go home,” said the dishwasher
as he laid down.

That he-man is here again, in another smashing hit—Victor McLaglen. Walter Connolly adds his efforts in this thriller. See it!

The morning’s mail brings a letter from our old contemporary, the Queens Blues’ Ima Heart-healer. It is learned with misgivings
that she is discontinuing her advice-to-the-lovelorn column in that worthy sheet—with misgivings because it has, during its all-too-short existence, been
an ever dependable source of material when the column seemed to stretch from here to there and back again. This
being Washington's birthday, I would suggest to Ima that we not only bury the hatchet, as per her suggestion, but
that we do the thing up right and bury it in a cherry tree. So long, Ima, hate to see
you go. The thought of you ignoring deadlines and copy calls, looking at a typewriter without murmuring “Yes Master,” and
generally living the life of non-columnistic leisure, turns this writer as green as the ink with which your first effort
was printed.

BISMARCK

You may have missed him around the campus. He wasn’t much of a dog, and after a car hit him
on the highway, just about all that was left was a soulful look in his liquid brown eyes. He was
put out of the way by the local police Friday night, and a deed of mercy it was; a deed
of valor, too—we couldn't have done it. Too bad, Bismarck. It was just one of those things. Shouldn’t wonder if
you’re wagging that lengthy tail somewhere else right now.

* * *

What with the journalistic demise of Ima Hearthealer and the execution of Bismarck, this is beginning to look like the
obituaries column. And while on the subject, let us comment on the imminent passing of Old Man Winter, who seems
even now to be on his last legs. He’s done a pretty poor job of it, too, as winters go.
All rain and no snow make Jack Frost a dull boy. However, we will be glad to call it even
if the old blow-hard will just ease out of the picture and let spring have a chance. We long for
grass and birds and stuff.

* * *

We mentioned it last week, but something has come up to make us repeat ourselves. The Pan-Hellenic Council has informed
your scribe that the radio announcer at the night mid-winters omitted the name of Davidson College on both of Jan
Garber’s broadcasts because he had previously received very definite instructions to the effect that he should. This is something beyond
our understanding. If ever a college needed just the kind of advertisement that broadcasts of a Jan Garber Mid-Winters can
give, it is old D. C. The Davidson spirit is, we pride ourselves, the tops; but the only way to
keep it so is to make future student bodies anxious to come here. The kind of publicity the college authorities
have a very definite and very needful appeal to the parents who send sons to Davidson—well and good. But young
men themselves want to know more about the school of their choice than that it is a denominational college sponsored
by the Presbyterian Church. They want to know that they will be amused and happy outside the classroom, and the
only way to assure them of this is to make public the good times we all enjoy here. Do you
agree, or don’t you?

* * *

We understand that the treasurer has just placed an order for 250 new beds. Springs in the air! This is
tangible proof that the administration recognizes that the best place for creative thought is in bed—doesn’t Mae West write her
stuff between the sheets? Don’t know whether I favor the order personally or not though. It’s hard enough to get
up in the morning now. With springs in my bed, I’m sure I’ll never make it before noon. And me
with three first period classes a week!
