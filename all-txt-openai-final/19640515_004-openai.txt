DAVIDSON AUDIENCE

Sometimes amused...

Davidson Audience Takes Chapel Speakers In Stride

By GREG GOVAN

"All students are expected to attend a designated number of these chapel and vesper services." Which is the same as
saying all men are expected to die. Over the long hours in Chamber's Auditorium, the Davidson audience has built up
a certain reaction to the expected necessity of chapel. Cut. You can save them all up and not go for
a whole month. Or you may join the worried ones, who take all their cuts at once lest the school
be destroyed in an atomic holocaust or act of Providence (or both) and that many attendances be wasted. But most
of the time the students are in expected, if not expectful, attendance.

This poses a distinct problem for the speaker. Many try to break the ice by putting students at their ease,
e.g., "I remember another captive audience I had back in Stalag 17...." A few freshmen laugh, the upper classes heave
an "oh no," and the whole thing is like Arab folk songs at a Zionist rally. Then there are the
speakers who capitalize on newspaper accounts. They work Fuhrman or Scriven into their opening remarks. The students react with a
"that's nice" in the form of hisses or murmurs. The most popular opener is the prayer, which, if long enough,
saves the embarrassment of nodding off early in an address.

Davidson chapel-sitters may react in different ways to the same things, depending on who says them. If you are an
outsider with no claim upon the school, appeal to basketball gets little. If you are a Yankee and quote how
little is being done towards Northernizing the South, there is applause. The surest way to get attention is to establish
identity: you as a speaker don’t really want to be there either. Col. W. L. Adams did this four years
ago by saying a very few words and dismissing chapel as the best thing he could say. Standing (and moving)
ovation. Or the students will sometimes react to pet subjects, like drinking and running your Corvette at 125 mph. The
subject of sex, however, is delicate, and advice to chapel speakers might be, if you don't have it, don’t talk
about it.

Things aren’t as bad as they could be. Three years ago the president of the Student Body bawled out a
chapel audience for whistling in awe at a speaker's eminent qualifications. And before our time it is reputed that a
dull speaker might look up from his notes and see a rustling sea of newspapers, umbrellas, and hand-passed students. But
that was back when they used to type term papers in the balcony during vespers.

An audience will sometimes sit spellbound by a speaker just because he or she knows what he is talking about,
or if even so familiar a feature as a professor tells something that is really true and really well done.
Or if someone challenges the old guard in a new way. But if a speaker doesn’t look like he could
draw a voluntary crowd of over five or if he plows the old furrows, standard diversions begin: sleeping, studying, following
the progress of a low-flying bird that stumbled into a forest of inviting heads. The Davidson student in captivity is
somewhat hostile, but not beyond reach. Or, the only expectation in chapel is that you be there. Things happen too
seldom to expect yourself to go.

THE DAVIDSONIAN

Lake Norman Attracts

It was 84 feet long, its beam measured 27½ feet. Its new white paint job was still shiny, with no
blemishes. It was a big boat, painted like a candy wagon and made to travel over an artificial, man-made lake.
But it did not seem out of place: it seemed to be a natural part of a natural body of
water.

The isolating greyness of Tuesday's cloudburst probably had a lot to do with this illusion. The raw, unfinished wood of
the moorings, soaked through with wetness, added a lot to it too. The mooring place is a half-enclosed extension from
the shoreline over the water. It surrounds on three sides the "Robert E. Lee" when the boat is tethered. From
its low roof are suspended fish nets, and the floor is planked.

"We want this to get good and ugly," co-owner L. B. Grier said Wednesday. There is a refreshment stand in
one corner, a small office in the other, and a ticket booth and a jukebox in between. Grier and partner
R. A. Hedrick, both of Statesville, conceived the plan for the riverboat when they heard about Duke Electric Power Company’s
plans for constructing Lake Norman. They did research on Mississippi River steamships and decided to make a replica of the
old "Robert E. Lee." They selected the present site (on Highway 21, about three miles north of the Davidson turnoff)
because of its strategic location as the center of an area whose population is two million people. Its proximity to
the future Interstate Highway 17 was a further consideration.

Construction of the boat itself began about a year ago. It was finished largely within nine months — "The same
time it takes anything to be born," said Grier. The "Robert E. Lee" can carry as many as 150 people,
depending on the activity involved. It is open to the public at large on weekends. Launchings take place at 2:30,
3:30, 4:30, and 5:30 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday. Prices are $1.50 for adults and 50 cents for children. Private
groups may charter the boat at other times.

Membership in the National Student Association was "very favorably passed" with a vote of 294-121 in the referendum held Monday,
it was announced by Student Body President Will Jackson in the Student Union. Jackson expressed the hope that the college
would begin to increase the benefits that can be derived from NSA, and he stated that he and Fred Sackett
will attend the NSA convention this summer.

Assisting in the re-evaluation program of Davidson's athletic facilities, the council has organized a questionnaire that will be distributed to
students after Tuesday's assembly. The suggestions and information will be used in formulating the expenditures for the athletic program. The
"summer reading list" will be available to students at the beginning of classes next fall. It was also stressed that
all clubs desiring renewal of their charters must turn in the proper forms immediately. Tom Frist asked that those people
planning to keep a gun on campus next year contact him.

In other action, John Barrow, freshman advisor and chairman of the Freshman Court, moved that freshman regulations begin after Rush
Week on Sept. 20. The regulations are to end on freshman-sophomore field day, Oct. 8. The motion was passed unanimously.
David Walker moved for adoption of a resolution that THE DAVIDSONIAN reporter spell correctly the names of Walker's friends, David
Meschan and Jay Rogers. The resolution was passed unanimously and this last meeting of the year was adjourned with senior
members John Spratt and Tommy Stafford absent.

Jones, Hallmark, Heidt Give Concert

Graduating Seniors Dupre Jones and Doug Heidt will join junior Rufus Hallmark in a four-part program of vocal pieces with
piano accompaniment to be held in...Hodson Hall Monday at 8:15 p.m. Hallmark, a tenor, will begin the evening's music with
selections from the work of Caccini, Handel, and Schubert. Jones will follow, singing selections from Mozart, Handel, and Williams. Jones,
whose major is physics, is a baritone. Mrs. Barbara Tritt, visiting instructor of piano, will accompany both Hallmark and Jones.
Heidt, an English major and president of the Male Chorus, will present the third part of the program, singing from
the work of Scarlatti, Handel, and Celius Dougherty. Heidt's accompanist will be Van Quinn, a junior, who is the organist
at the Davidson College Presbyterian Church. To conclude the program, Hallmark will return to sing selections from Faure, Richard Strauss,
and Samuel Barber. The program will be followed by a reception in the Stowe Galleries.

$100 ($150 for evenings Friday through Sunday) or for two dollars per person, whichever is greater. The SAE’s and Betas
have already held parties on the boat under these terms. There were no charter voyages on Wednesday, and Grier was
discussing other plans with one of his workers. He was willing to take time off to point out special features
of the “Robert E. Lee,” however. The boat has three decks. The upper one serves as a cabin for the
pilot, James M. Hedrick, who has two assistants on every cruise. The lower two are used by the passengers. The
craft weighs 36 tons, has a speed of 10 knots, and is diesel-powered. It is actually propelled by its own
drive-side paddle wheels. “So far as I know, it’s the only one operating east of the Mississippi,” said Grier. It
has real lanterns, a lifesaver, four smoke stacks, a paddlewheel riverboat. Lake Norman’s waters were choppy as a heavy storm
beat down on them last Tuesday, but Riverboat NC-68-H, the “Robert E. Lee,” rested undisturbed at its gangplank, and two
restrooms—one for ladies and one for “Gentlemen.” It has a speaker system, too, and powder blue chairs and benches to
contrast with its red trim. The boat's safety features include high-pressure pumping for fire hoses and enough styrofoam in the
hull to support 36 tons of weight.

What about the enterprise's future? Grier was optimistic. Bookings for the boat had been made into next September, and long-range
plans, which the partners “hope to make short range soon,” involved converting a five-acre island into a midway stopping place
for passengers. There various means of amusement would be provided. Now it takes a rainstorm to make the “Robert E.
Lee” seem at home on Lake Norman. But the time may come when it does not.

AWARDS STILL GIVEN Years Shorten Commencement

By TOM LOFLIN

Since the first graduating class in 1840 proudly picked up diplomas, the commencement program at Davidson has changed significantly. That
year, each senior was held in such esteem that he was allowed to speak a few, or many, words during
the program. This year, there will be no speeches at all. No commencement speaker will rise to challenge the graduates
to do well as they “go out into the world in a tomorrow that has now arrived.” Since 1961, the
Davidson valedictorian and salutatorian have not given speeches and have had their positions in the exercise reduced to the point
where they merely stand to be recognized. In 1960 the last talks were given by David Robinson, who criticized the
weaknesses of the college, and by Dabney Stuart, who gave a salutatory which lasted less than a minute and repeated
a theme emphasized so much by Jesus: “Love one another.” Last year, even the commencement speaker was cut from the
program to save time. The only outside speaker this year will be present for the Sunday morning baccalaureate service which
precedes the commencement. To cut the time still more, all but two awards have been switched to the annual Awards
Day, which is held each May during assembly. Due to the stipulations of the givers, the William Banks Bible Medal,
given each year to the member of the graduating class “who has completed four years of Bible with the highest
distinction,” and the Algernon Sydney Sullivan Award have remained on the commencement program. The latter award consists of two medallions
presented each year by the New York Southern Society in memory of its founder. One goes to a person outside
the student body and the other to a member of the Senior Class. The awards recognize “fine spiritual qualities practically
applied to daily living.” The college has further limitations to guide in the selection of the recipient of the awards.
The senior chosen each year by the nominating committee of the faculty is a student who has done service which
previously has not been rewarded or recognized. The faculty recommends seniors who fit this requirement; the committee then selects the
student it feels most worthy of the award. The committee itself, on the announcement sent each year to faculty members
asking for recommendations, states, “These awards, as you know, are made for unselfish service beyond the call of duty and
for which the recipient has received no recognition, pecuniary or otherwise.” The majority of time during the commencement is, of
course, taken up with the awarding of degrees. This part is what seniors have been waiting for during four years
of work at “one of the South’s strongest and most demanding institutions.”
