pledge class. To illustrate the social prowess of our brothers we quote from the Queen Blues, “Girls, just one at
a time the food will get around.” Heywood Brinegar to us all. Hear he finally made it back to the
feed week-end—Agnes Scott, Queens, Converse, W. C., to name a few—and then many thanks to Mrs. Thompson and crew for
such good women and meals.

PHI DELTA THETA

Once again the annual homecoming recedes into a memory. Husky voices, blood-shot eyes, and depleted bank accounts are all that
remain of the memorable Homecoming week-end which the Pikas passed through. There are no regrets and few complaints. All were
well pleased with the festivities. A vote of appreciation is in order for Brothers Jack Fanjoy and Charlie Hadley and
all the rest that assisted with the Homecoming decorations for a fine job. Also one to Brother John McNair for
the banquet and Brother Insign for a splendid performance.

KAPPA SIGMA

The reports and after effects are still coming in from a gala homecoming week-end though the hottest news of the
week centers around Brother Bulldawg Smith who with Miss Betsy Smith is reported to have been bound in the sacred
ties of matrimony at York, S.C. No less sensational was the “Send 'em Home Alive” Wilcox duck hunting expedition way
up in the frozen North where the laughing seals play. Brother Cheek and Rice said it was too much and
preferred to wait for “Forever Amber.” Mouse Morgan, the lottery king, and “heal-billy sanger,” diverted a little time from extra-curricular
activities and the Arthur Smith show to contribute his share to the dance—the “Near You” dance at the Charlotte Hotel.
It’s hard to tell just who the real dealers were at the dance last Saturday night. Brother Mebane, accompanied by
H. P. Smith, Witherspoon and Bill Waters and Jarrett (“Bofus”) are still aglow but mostly with bloodshot eyes. Principle misdeals
were headed by Real Dubose who triple dated with his mother and grandmother while Stan Balls split date.

CHARLOTTE CARAVAN

Breakfast time and are carried through one entire day in the lives scene, which contains all those elements of poignant
sorrow and abundant happiness that make for solemnity and impressiveness. In the third act we are led to the cemetery
on the hill, where many of the townspeople we have come to know so well are patiently and smilingly awaiting
not “judgment” but greater understanding. Into their midst is led the bride, a little timid at first, a little wishful
to go back to life, to live again with her memories but is shown how impossible, how futile it is
to return. The past cannot be re-lived. Living people, humans, occupied by petty occupations and small thoughts, know.oc- little of
true joy or happiness.

(D) CHARLOTTE CARAVAN

responded for the caravan, and gave a short commercial for his store, Isenjake’s Clothier, Inc. Again the crowd roared its
approval, and other dignitaries clustered up to the microphone to invite each and all to Charlotte for shopping. Dave Price
put the finishing touch in every state in the Union, easily seen why!” Com- The second act concerns the love
affair between young George Gibbs and little Emily Webb, and thus culminates in a moving wedding. A few who have
been around this campus for several years have commented to the effect that the week-end was one of the most
remembered. For instance, Sam Davis, Gregg, Elmo Sellers, Harry Shaw, Ed Watt, and Andy White.

There were many scenes amid the dances, “Pan Hell” and a combination of the two in George Grimball. It is
in order these men get a vote of thanks for their fine work. To be included, of course, are the
others—Chandler, Rhodes, Anderton, et al.

A fine one with so many organized and it was good to see a spirit of cooperation on the dance
floor—for last week-end, as hard to get some pleasure and some pain and hoped will continue for the rest of
the dances. The pledges certainly proved themselves to be socially backward, and we would however cater one word of advice:
do not throw twins, HATR EVERETT, or Mable Rawlerey away too soon. We again thank all those to whom thanks
are due for a job well done.

BETA THETA PI
This week among the Betas. The football team downing the Pi Kapp’s and S.P.E.s in interfraternity ball and Brother Turner
really showed his stuff in the V.M.I. game when he ran with that ball! From all indications, Brother Ashman’s and
Shaw’s dates were really eager to get to this homecoming; They got here early, didn't they? Amid all the hustle
and bustle, they held their own with their dates. I think the brothers and alumnae would agree that the occasion
was a great success.

After the big dance on Friday night, all of the brothers and dates went on to the river party. Details
are slim (as usual) but eyewitnesses reveal everything was lovely (as usual). DOOM, ODELL, and their respectives and unrespectives were
among the notables present.

Next on the program was a duet by the renowned Claude Casey and Miss Betty Ann Newman of radio station
W.B.T. To get into the Christmas spirit, they sang the ever-popular lyric “Money Is the Root of All Evil, So
Bring It and Leave It in Charlotte.” Mr. Casey, being attired in range clothing and Texas boots, was a veritable
picture of the old west, as he strummed his banjo. Miss Newman was most attractive in a fiery red dress,
as she sang, smiled, and winked to the subdued gathering of peasants around her.

At the close of the song, Mr. Ikey Greenspan announced that the time had now arrived to crown “Miss Davidson,”
the young lass who will represent Davidson at the Beauty Festival contest in Charlotte on November 12. Forthwith, he was
given a lovely crown of 10-carat cardboard, and placed it upon the head of the ever-beautiful local Miss Jane Isenhour,
as she stood between the two gasoline pumps just south of Hatley’s. Miss Isenhour was asked to say a few
words to the assembled crowd and after a few moments of hesitation she gave forth with “Howdy.”

LETTERS TO EDITOR

There may be obstacles in the way of securing these things, but I believe the faculty will agree with us
that the benefits far outweigh the trouble. I hope that in the future we may look forward to at least
a reasonable number of these exhilarating additions to our training.
