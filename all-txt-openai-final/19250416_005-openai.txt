Wit and Humor Galore in Old-Time Minstrel Saturday Night Entertainment Fea-tured by Junior Speaking

Play “The Follies of 1926" presented by the Junior class during Junior Speaking was staged last Saturday night at the Gym by a real old-time minstrel. The minstrel was a complete exhibition of wit and humor, interspersed with solos to give the audience time to recover from the side-splitting laughter.

As the curtains were pulled, the opening chorus, “All About Girls,” was sung by the gentlemen of the minstrel ensemble, and this was concluded with a solo by Ed Wilson. Having finished the opening chorus, the interlocutor, Hayden Hollingsworth, introduced “Sambo,” the Salutatorian, impersonated by Flake Laird, who in his characteristic comical style welcomed the audience with bits of humor which immediately brought everyone into the spirit of all the fun. Following “Sambo’s” banterings with the interlocutor, Woodrow Wilson rendered the very touching solo: “When You and I Were Seventeen.”

Next “Bones,” impersonated by Fred Smith, gave a concentrated dissertation on “Condensed Milk,” after which he demonstrated his ability in putting over several jokes. Then Fred sang “Hot Tamale Molly,” much to the amusement of the listeners. As the applause for “Hot Tamale Molly” died away, the interlocutor introduced “Tobe,” the class poet, impersonated by Colin Murchison, who read the Class “Pome,” funny because of its ridiculousness. The reading of the Class “Pome” was followed by the solo, “Show Me the Way,” sung by Frank Hudson.

Next, “Jethro,” impersonated by Harllee Branch, presented the Class Gift in such a humorous way that none but the deaf could have resisted laughing. Now the above-named endmen prophesied concerning the future prognostications of each other with no less humor than characterized the other parts, which was enormous and ridiculous.

To conclude the program, Piggy Martin sang “Oh Mabel” and on the chorus, the entire minstrel joined in and then—the curtain.

The cast was as follows: Interlocutor, Hayden Hollingsworth; Endmen, “Tennessee” Smith, “Carolina” Murchison, “Willow” Branch, “Bearcat” Laird; Gentlemen of the Chorus: “Long-distance” Wilson, “Tomcat” Barr, “Jelly” Hudson, “Wildcat” Lowrance, “Snowball” Martin, “Woodrow” Wilson, “Sunshine” Lockhart, “Ferocious” Foster.

The next event, under the supervision of Professors Fleagle and Goldiere, will be equally interesting. They will include a musical program, plays, and a feature act by two Mexican dancers. Don't overlook the fact that the Queens girls will be taking part in the program. Everyone turn out to hear them! You won't regret it. Watch our Spanish department!—it is unquestionably becoming the liveliest in the state. The admission will be twenty-five cents, a probable sacrifice in the proceeds, in order to give everybody the chance to take it in.

DAVIDSON SINGERS THRILL
(Continued from page 1)

The Davidson Glee Club has given seventeen performances this year and has won admiration and praise wherever it has appeared. It has been favorably compared with the best Glee Clubs in the South Atlantic States. Its appearance at Queens, Agnes Scott, Salem, and N.C. C. W. has won for it much popularity among the young ladies of the land.

The management is glad to announce that the Glee Club is again free from all financial obligations, and it hopes to remain on the same sound footing henceforth. The Glee Club for the remainder of the year will be under the direction of its newly elected officers, D. G. Wilson, President, and Frank Hudson, Manager.

Some changes have occurred in the hitting of the Davidson team. The average has dropped slightly from the last three games, it now being .220. Harry Vance has had to give way in the lead to Hampton, who has been at bat twice and hit once, giving him a .500 average.
