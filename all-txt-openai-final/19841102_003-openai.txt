**Race Task Force Working Toward Nov. Deadline**

By ALLISON WILLS

The Racial/Ethnic Concerns Task Force appointed by President John Kuykendall is progressing on schedule and plans to submit its report by Nov. 30. Created by Kuykendall to “respond adequately to the concerns which have been raised,” the committee is critically studying life at Davidson for black students and other minorities.

The task force consists of 20 members — five students, four faculty members, five administrators, three alumni, three trustees, and a recorder — with a “significant representation from racial/ethnic groups.” Kuykendall appointed mathematics Professor Bruce Jackson and Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid John Griffith as co-chairmen. Kuykendall asked that several members of the Presidential Advisory Committee on Minorities serve on the task force, but this effort, he said, “should not be understood as a replacement for that group.”

The members have agreed not to comment on their proceedings until the report is distributed Dec. 5, but Griffith and Jackson — acting as spokesmen for the group — said the report will include the president’s request for “specific actions and activities to be undertaken by the College, including suggested goals and timetables for our efforts.”

Members of the task force have organized into four subcommittees to address particular issues. One subcommittee will deal with Davidson’s past policies regarding racial problems; one will study the current racial situation here; and another will study how other institutions similar to Davidson are handling racial concerns. The fourth subcommittee — chaired by Trustee John A. Mawhinney, Jr. and composed of Jackson, Griffith, the chairmen of the other three committees, and the recorder — will pull the task force’s ideas together and formulate a policy statement.

Griffith said an outside consultant, Carol Ramsey, vice-president of A Better Chance, Inc., visited here last week. The organization she represents — made up of around 220 high schools and colleges across the country — aims at making educational experiences better for blacks and other minority students.

The task force has scheduled Dec. 6 to Jan. 31 as a period of feedback which will include faculty, staff, and student forums. By late January the final report is scheduled to be drafted and discussed with the Trustees. Students serving on the committee are SGA president John Laughlin, Black Student Coalition president senior Janet Stovall, R.A.C.E. president Andrew Yon, seniors Atondra Williams and Rodney Holman.

**SPE Prepares Campus Move**

By TED WILSON

Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity is “in the process of drawing up an agreement to submit to the college” to move back on campus, according to SPE President Steve MacMillan. He emphasized, “we're still considering other alternatives so the decision to move on campus is not final.”

The Town Board of Adjustment last May denied the fraternity special use zoning, prohibiting it from using its Main Street house as a fraternity house. The Board gave SPE until July 1, 1985, “to convert the house to a residential use or to vacate the premise.” MacMillan said “there is a general feeling to move back on campus,” after residing off-campus for 13 years. He said fraternity members are looking at other options such as relocating in town, and have looked into several sites. “A final decision should be made within the next month or two,” he said.

Dean of Students Will Terry said if SPE relocated on campus, “it will follow the same Self-Selection process” as the other fraternities. Currently, SPE uses a bid system, not the Self-Selection system. Terry said, “my initial response is that it will [have to] abide by all the rules of Patterson Court like all other eating clubs do.” He added, however, “it may be that the Council on Campus and Religious Life will make other recommendations” and impose restrictions.

MacMillan said the administration seems “very positive about the SPE’s coming back on campus.” The fraternity has been working with Terry and President John Kuykendall while drawing up a contract, he said. “We can’t sign a basic Patterson Court contract because many of the things don’t apply.” For example, MacMillan said, the house will not serve meals. Terry said “their return as a fraternity [that does not serve meals] on campus will raise for us certain questions about the future direction of Patterson Court.” Though ensuing decisions concerning the Court’s composition may not affect SPE, Terry said “their petition to come back raises questions [such as] ‘How many fraternities do we need on campus,’ and ‘What can we project will be the demography of the houses on the court?’”

She said her proposal "basically involves a project to make what I have studied come alive. I want to be immersed in a city that loves music." McDonald hopes to experience Vienna’s "imagination" that other musicians and composers have felt and responded to. She said her study would shed light on her future graduate study and teaching career. By studying in Vienna, McDonald said, "I could give a student a first-hand sense of what it could be like to be Beethoven playing a piece."

Ginna McGee
While visiting Ireland last year, McGee developed an interest in religious pilgrimages. She wants to photograph pilgrimages in Spain, Portugal, Mexico, and Guatemala, in addition to shrines and holy places in those countries. The religious imagery in the festivals interests McGee. She also wants to compare the Central American festivals with those on the Iberian peninsula. The native religions of Guatemala and Mexico, McGee said, have influenced the festivals there, distinguishing them from festivals in Spain and Portugal.

Beth Maczka
Maczka feels that in India, there exists a relationship among women, religion, and rural development. She wants to examine the perception of religion within three women’s communities in India and determine how an Indian woman’s community experiences affect them when they return to their village and family. One of the communities, a Hindu spiritual community, aims at exploring science and spirituality, which it holds as the two sources of truth. In addition, Maczka would study an Indian atheist community for women, which she said, seeks to realize the potential of the women in the community. It differs from the Hindu community in that it encourages atheism and views religion as a barrier to development. "I want to study the ethical implications of that," Maczka said. The third community she would study resides in the state of Kerala. The community is a Catholic women’s group that emphasizes education in developing Indian women’s potential. These communities, Maczka said, are a novelty in India, where women traditionally function as wives and mothers and have, as a group, a low literacy rate. Women often suffer from stereotypes in Indian society, she said, and that hinders them in realizing potential. Improving the position of women would enhance the development of the country as a whole, according to some theories, she added. "A country is only as developed as its women," Maczka said.

Sally Howell
Within the Arab-Israeli conflict in the Middle East, the role of non-Muslim women is an issue, and Howell would travel to Egypt, Israel, and Syria to study the changing relationship of non-Muslim women in their societies. Islamic law and culture, Howell said, give women little say in government and in the home. But non-Muslim women are gaining ground in areas traditionally controlled by men, she said. In time, "it will be easier for Muslim women to do the same," Howell said. Her study would expand her center major in Middle East studies, as well as focus her interests in graduate study or possible careers in the Foreign Service, teaching, or working for Arab political action groups in Washington, D.C. For Howell, breaking into a foreign culture and establishing relationships would remain an obstacle as well as a goal.

The Watson Foundation seeks fellows at 50 colleges and universities throughout the United States and has awarded 1,090 fellowships and $8,732,634 in grants since its founding in 1961. The foundation will announce its awards March 15, 1985.

Honor Code (continued from page 1)
Stell believes that published decisions would serve the rights of the defendant as well as "forestall groundless rumors which contain a fantastic variety of accounts of what the Council has done and what its reasons were." Abbott noted the need for "a clearer distinction between deliberate intent to deceive and an accident." This is perhaps the greatest area of trepidation on the part of students. Many echoed the sentiments of senior Todd Sachtjen: "Always my feeling when I write a paper is that I could make an honest mistake and get kicked out of school." Complaints similar to the one voiced by sophomore Kathleen Micham are prevalent. She described an incident this year in which she wished to enter the Commons with friends and promised not to eat, and she was refused. "If they're going to trust us not to cheat on a test, they should trust us to go into the Commons and not eat."

Though students and faculty hold grievances and anxieties concerning the Honor Code, their predominant attitude is one of pride and respect. "It builds a sense of responsibility on the part of the student," Sutton said. "It’s unusual to see how it works," freshman David Lett said. Freshman Kirk Orrell said, "It's the basis for so much around here that's good."
