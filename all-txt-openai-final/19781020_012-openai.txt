**Art is double-featured this week**

Although the Davidson National Print and Drawing Competition is a thing of the past, Davidson has not forgotten the importance
of art in our education. Two events this week bring the world of art into clearer focus for Davidson students.

The first is the two-day visit of Clement Greenberg, described by the New York Times as “internationally the best-known American
art critic.” Greenberg, the juror of the 1973 Print and Drawing Competition, has written articles and books dealing primarily with
contemporary arts—its relation to philosophy, the phenomenon of “kitsch,” and a variety of other topics.

His schedule at Davidson, the same for both days, will be as follows: At 10:00 a.m. he will speak on
“Dealing with—Not In—Contemporary Art,” then he will be the guest at a luncheon at 1:00 in the Morrison Room, followed
by an informal conversation. At 8:00 p.m. he will lecture on “States of Culture.” All lectures are in Chambers Gallery.

The Gallery will also be the setting for the second art-centered event on campus this week, as Davidson hosts the
Lakeside Studio Exhibition and Sale.

Brought to Davidson under the auspices of Herb Jackson, this collection contains over 1,000 original Old Master, Modern Master, and
Contemporary prints of Daumier, Durer, Goya, Whistler, Richard Hunt, and many others. Also in the collection will be a number
of Japanese woodcuts.

The exhibit will be open from 10 to 4. The director of the studio will be with the exhibit and
will be glad to answer any questions concerning the display.
