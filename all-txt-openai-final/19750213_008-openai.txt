The Davidsonian January 1, 2001 Frank Stiefel 4 = The Davidsonian SPORTS Chuck Kennon Sports Editor Assistant Sports Editor THIS WENT OVER WELL IN L.A! See Greg Dunn exhibits his amazing sense of balance during the East Carolina game. None of the Pirates could do this trick. A new program of electives to satisfy the Physical Education requirements was revealed by Athletic Director Thom Cartmill on Saturday, Feb. 5. “I believe that these options allow a greater degree of flexibility, commensurate with the maturity of today’s Davidson student,” Cartmill stated. “These options fit in perfectly with all phases of the average student’s lifestyle. We don’t want to interfere with their serious pursuits,” he added. The new program consists of five separate individual and two team sports. These include: The Charles Atlas Body Building Course. This is designed to be done in the student’s spare moments. The charge of $9.98 plus shipping and handling is added to the student’s Activities Fee. Sword Swallowing. This is designed for both sexes but SGA President John Munce expressed hope that attendance would consist primarily of women students. “We feel that this course is one that the girls can gain practical experience from and apply in their free time.” The course is team-taught by Dean of Women Diane Stone and Economics Professor C. Louise Nelson. Neck and Skull Conditioning. Students practice banging their heads against the wall to toughen the muscles in the interior of the skull cavity. “We give any student a personally-determined number of times to bang his head per day. The number is arrived at by taking the inverse of his G.P.A. and multiplying that by the number of terms he has left at Davidson,” Munce explained. Waterbed pushups. This is a rigorous system of pushups designed to be performed on a waterbed. This course accepts only partners. Usually one teammate is on top, with the one underneath pushing off to maintain a steady rhythm. “I am especially fond of this course. It encourages the healthy interplay of people that Davidson has always sought to foster,” Dean of Students Will Terry commented. Simplified isometrics. In this course students are taught a convenient system of isometric exercises utilizing the natural tensions that run through many students’ bodies. “This is a super-handy course. I love it because the kids can knock off studying for a few seconds and do these things with the chair right there in their carrel. All work and no play makes for a dull Wildcat,” Vice President in charge of Academic Affairs Jack Bevan enthused. In addition to the above “individual” sports, two “team” sports have been added to the P.E. roster. These are: Cats Trundle Past VMI, 94-93 Dunn, Verlin Spark Yawner The Wildcats, generally regarded as inept on the road, summoned up from somewhere deep within their tortured psyches those twin virtues of hustling and fast, good playing to overly toy with the Virginia Military Institute’s immature Keydets and finally arrived at a drawn-out 94-93 victory. The Cats took their own sweet time, as they threw the game into double overtime before dashing the over-eager tin soldiers. In fact, during the second half, it looked as if Davidson Coach Bo Brickels had once again spotted the opponent 10-15 points. VMI led by six at the half, 41-35, and seemed to be on the way to taking their turn at making the Cats run themselves into the hard dirty court. With 13 minutes left the improbable Keydets had chiseled a 14-point lead onto the scoreboard and eight minutes later, with less than six minutes to go, they deluded themselves with an 11-point advantage. Ah, but in vain did the boy soldiers fight, as the determined, fired-up, battling Wildcats placed themselves back into contention behind the sublime striving of junior Tommie Verlin’s joust-high 29 points. Well done, lad. What happened is that, like VMI had a free throw and missed it, so like Greg Dunn (he’s C.A., you know)Got fouled on the rebound an’ he made both shots. There were only two seconds left, so man, the Cats got overtime. Then, like, man, VMI had to put it into the second overtime, and the Cats nearly got really messed up. ‘Cause like even with less than a minute left, VMI had a 3-point lead and man, like it looked all over. But big Sheldon Parker, who frankly folks has been something of an enigma this year, and that’s putting it mildly, came through with his only basket of the game to put the Cats within one, and Dunn hit a layup with 23 seconds left. Dunn was the clutch player for the Cats tonight, making 20 points overall, six in the crucial second overtime.

Brickels regarded the game to be something of a rush. “I said to them boys at halftime, I said, ‘You gotta shape up better, boys,’ I said. I gave them a real good talking-to, and it really musta perked them up a little, I mean, lookit what they did—they went and won the damn thing. I never knew I had it in me. I’m so happy, really I am,” he stated.

The Keydets repeatedly injured themselves with fouls this evening, and this cost them the game when they made an offensive foul with four seconds remaining. The military pawns doubtless have little love for the Cats, who held up their attempt at a 12th victory, for the first time since 1964, which coincidentally is the last time they made a Davidson basketball team taste defeat. The loss drops VMI to 11-9 overall and 6-4 for the season. Conversely, the win helped Davidson’s record, raising it to a surprising 6-15 against all foes, and 3-5 in the conference, which is the Southern Conference, which has a tournament that the Cats still have a slight chance in hell of playing at home in.

Planned Squaring the Circle. Small groups of students gather on an informal basis to put their heads together, do deep-breathing and breath control exercises, and contemplate the Chain of Being. “This is another fine exercise that embodies the actualized principles upon which Davidson is founded. Students can come together and benefit in mind and body in a meaningful way,” said Terry.

Weekend Gymnastics. This sport frequently includes coed students who are interested enough in, or blindly led to, the strange physical games played by Davidson men. The stagnant supply of Davidson females who indulge in these usually nocturnal romps, and the scores can become the topic on many lips about campus. “In the past, this has always been the most popular game on campus, and I am glad to see students get official credit for it now. It supports the highest ideals of Davidson and the trustees: the sense of a community, people living and playing together in harmony, loving familiarity, and mutual understanding,” Terry stated. The new courses begin in the spring.
