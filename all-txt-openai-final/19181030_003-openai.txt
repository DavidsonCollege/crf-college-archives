“TREATING” AN EXTRAVAGANT HABIT

Douglass Fairbanks says that the greatest American evil today is the “treating habit.” The typical American spends in a few hours in treating what it takes him three days to earn. It is all very well to be liberal, he says, but this is the time to conserve, to think before you spend, to lend every possible penny to the government in order to bring peace again to the world. “Doug” Fairbanks is a great booster for War Savings Stamps. He says that they can’t be beaten as an investment, but that all patriotic Americans should buy them for the encouragement it gives the boys who are doing the fighting. They must be encouraged to victory and nothing will keep them optimistic andFeed their American enthusiasm more than to know that the people at home are saving and buying in memory of them. He calls on all good Americans to buck up, to get together, to put their hands in their pockets and come across or go across.

FRATERNITY HALLS CLOSED FOR PERIOD OF THE WAR

The fraternities at Davidson have been hard hit by the new government ruling, that all fraternity houses would be closed after October 20, and no initiation of new members could take place after that date. No meetings are to be held, except strictly business meetings, and these not very often. The fraternities at Davidson are not allowed to have houses off the campus, and it has been the custom to rent a hall annually for their use during recreation hours. These, however, are now idle, and will continue so until after the war.

GUARDHOUSE LOCATED IN SOUTH WING CHAMBERS

The people of Davidson are soon to witness a new sight—a sentinel walking post on Davidson campus. As guard duty is one of the soldier's main duties, he must learn it thoroughly. For this reason, a guard will be posted on the campus as soon as the rifles come and the men have learned to use them. The south wing of Chambers’ building will be used as the guardhouse. Post No. 1 will be located around the guardhouse. The remaining posts will probably run in a circle around the barracks. No. 2 running from the east side of the Library along the walk in front of the barracks to the east side of B company barracks. Post No. 3 will probably extend from the east side of the Library along the road in rear of barracks to the east side of B company barracks. Sentinels must memorize the twelve general orders for sentinels as prescribed in the Manual of Interior Guard Duty, and also the two special orders for Post No. 1. A copy of these will be found on the bulletin board. A sentinel is on duty for two hours. While on duty he is not allowed to sit down, smoke, or talk to anyone except in line of duty. He is in complete charge of his post and is responsible for the conduct of anyone on or near it. Two sergeants, three corporals, and nine privates will be detailed for guard duty each day.
