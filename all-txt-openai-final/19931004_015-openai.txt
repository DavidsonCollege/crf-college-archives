The Davidson football team took a short road trip for a big road victory behind senior quarterback Richard Howell’s three rushing touchdowns and two big blocked punts by the special teams. This victory was Davidson’s first at Guilford in over 11 years and brought the team’s record to .500 for the second time this season. The Cats upped their series record dominance to 18-6-1 with an impressive victory.

Davidson bit early, opening a 14-0 lead in the first quarter on two 1-yard runs by Howell. The second touchdown was set up by a big special teams play when sophomore Bo Bartholomew gangbusted through the Quaker line for his first career blocked punt. Though he is the quarterback, Howell is an effective runner as well, gathering 60 yards on 22 carries. He picked up his other rushing touchdown late in the second quarter on a 7-yard trot for his third touchdown of the day.

Though Howell did the scoring, junior Bruce Bannister did the running, rolling up 117 yards on 20 carries to lead Davidson on the day. Behind the three rushing touchdowns by Howell, Davidson took a 21-11 lead into halftime. The only scoring in the third quarter came behind another big special teams play. Following the second blocked punt of the day by the Cats, Mike Warrick picked up the loose ball for a 25-yard return and a touchdown for a 28-11 lead. The score would be all that the Cats would need.

Uncharacteristically, the defense allowed the Guilford squad to run at will, giving up 356 yards on 54 carries for the day. This total almost equaled what Davidson has given up all year long. After a Guilford touchdown, the Cats answered with a fifth touchdown, when Howell connected with senior Kelly Shirley for a three-yard touchdown pass in the fourth quarter to put the game away. Shirley ended up as the leading receiver with 3 catches for 79 yards. Howell ended up with impressive stats again through the air, completing 10 of 18 passes for 168 yards with one interception and one touchdown. For the day, Howell was involved in 63% of the Wildcats’ offense.

The Cats will next travel to Washington & Lee this weekend and will then face Methodist here.

Cat Nips
Sniffing around the kitty litter for tidbits
By Robert Lloyd-Still & Peter Amidon

It’s that time of year again when the fair-weather Atlanta Braves fans come out of the woodwork. Here they are wearing their brand new t-shirts and Braves caps which still aren’t broken in. They all claim to have been watching the Braves on TBS when Bob Horner played third and Chief Nakahoma cheered from his teepee in centerfield. In reality, they’ve been fans for three seasons and a season to them is the NLCS and the World Series.

We are really upset with the situation at the lake campus. As freshmen, we never paid five dollars an hour to take out the sailboats. We understand a five dollar fee on gas if waterskiing, but paying to sail is ridiculous. The sailboats are already paid for. We would like to see the policy reversed. And why aren’t the facilities ever open under their supposed hours?

Where the heck is intramural street hockey? We had some of our fondest memories playing this sport on the outdoor basketball courts. If you see Rogers King, please console him because this was one of the highlights of his life.

We have some problems with the overtime system in flickerball. As it presently stands, each team has four plays in which to gain as much yardage as possible. The problem is that if the first team loses yardage, then the second team only has to down the ball four times. Let’s implement a five-minute overtime or let the teams see who can score first.
