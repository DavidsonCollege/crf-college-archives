**Davidson football drops three games: A sour Colonial League debut**

By STEWART RAWSON AND MATT TERRELL

Davidson kicked off the 1987 football campaign in a “battle of the Presbyterians” against the Blue Hose from Presbyterian College. The Wildcats forged into the game with high anticipation after the unsuccessful ’86 season in this, coach Vic Gatto’s third term as Davidson’s head coach. The team fought valiantly in the first half, but couldn’t find the spark in the second half. Freshman Bryn Robinson returned the opening kickoff 63 yards, but Davidson failed to capitalize on the good field position. Presbyterian took advantage of the Wildcats’ inability to move the ball and marched 77 yards in 13 plays on their ensuing possession. Later in the opening period, Presbyterian recovered a Davidson fumble and scored on a 16-yard pass from quarterback Scotty McGowan to split end Eddie Rogers. The Wildcats closed out the first half with a 6-yard touchdown run by Robinson, setting the stage for a showdown in the second half. At the start of the second half, Davidson failed to convert on a fourth and goal from the 4; and from there Presbyterian went on to take command of the game with ten second-half points for a final tally of 24-7.

In the second game of the season, the Wildcats made their debut as a member of the Colonial League, a move the Davidson athletic department labeled as a chance for the program to be more competitive while maintaining the...

**Soccer forges ahead into strong season**

By WHIT WILKS

The 1987 Wildcat soccer team has completed the early part of its schedule in most impressive fashion. Coach Charlie Slagle’s squad is currently 4-2-1 following Friday’s 2-0 loss to Florida International. Included in the victories are wins over Winthrop, Richmond, Georgetown, and archrival U.N.C.C.; the lone loss was to James Madison, and the tie occurred against the 49ers.

While most of us were enjoying the last fleeting days of summer, Slagle had his team enduring three weeks of intense pre-season training. The work began to pay dividends two weeks ago in the opener against Winthrop in Rock Hill, S.C. Junior Mike Friedlander accounted for both tallies in the 2-0 match. Senior goalie Jim Kelly returned to the team after a year’s absence due to injury and recorded the shutout. The team then ventured to Richmond to take on the Spiders, a team that has given the Cats fits in the past. This team paid no attention to history and squashed the Spiders 3-1, on tallies by Friedlander, Junior Tracy Hankins, and senior co-captain Michael Spear.

The team finally played the home opener on September 6th against a powerful James Madison team. The Cats fell 3-1 in a match played exclusively in the driving rain. Spear scored the lone Wildcat goal against the Dukes. The team next saw action against U.N.C.C. last Wednesday at home on a field ravaged by the previous contest. The Cats looked sloppy early on and found themselves on the short end of a 2-0 halftime score. The second half saw improved play and the Cats broke on the board on Rob Vest’s drive past the 49er netminder. The team could not maintain its newfound energy and trailed 3-1 with just five minutes to go. Just when things looked their bleakest, junior Tracy Hankins took a pass at about the fifteen and beat the defenseless keeper. With this new momentum, the Cats turned up the pressure and culminated the effort with only seconds to go on a deflected goal off the foot of senior Craig Mattison. The astounded 49ers then weathered the storm, as the teams battled through two scoreless overtimes.

**Field hockey tops Salem College, 4-1**

By LARRY DAGENHART, JR.

The Davidson field hockey team opened its 1987 season Tuesday with a 4-1 victory over Salem College. Scoring for the Wildcats were freshman Marjorie Havinghurst, sophomore Marta Bukowski, junior Margot Mims, and senior Janet Bitter. Coach Betsy Pryor commented on the game, “I was very pleased with our offense, and we were much more aggressive in the circle than we have been before.” Midfielder Gigi Cooke also kept the Salem defense at bay with her attack on the right side.

With over nine returning players, Coach Pryor hopes for a “complete turnaround from last year.” The Cats are led by seniors Mandy Barrett (captain), Janet Bitter, and Betsy Rothschild. Possible junior starters include halfback Eileen Keeley, forwards Suzanne Mauze and Marian Singer, and goalkeeper Elizabeth Franklin. Sophomores Christy Sloan and Marta Bukowski are returning to fill the centerback and right forward positions, respectively. Davidson has also found some bright spots in the freshman class. Gigi Cooke, the leading scorer at Norfolk Academy in Virginia, should provide some extra quickness at midfield for the Cats. Other freshmen include right wing Havinghurst and fullback Marcie White, who were high school teammates at Durham Academy. Coach Pryor believes they will “work together well.”

The 1987 schedule is not easy. Davidson travels to Duke and also has games with Appalachian State on the 29th and Wake Forest on October 7th. Junior Eileen Keeley commented on Davidson’s performance so far: “It’s a tremendous improvement over last year. We have a long way to go, but there’s a light at the end of the tunnel.”At the Charlotte Stadium last weekend, in the opening round, the Cats fell behind 1-0 at halftime before rallying on goals by senior co-captain Steve Ott and the winner by Friedlander. Sunday night’s championship saw the Cats again face the 49ers, who had beaten Cincinnati 5-0 Saturday (nice job of scheduling there, huh?). The Cats' new volleyball coach academic standards of the school. The Cats’ premiere resulted in a 47-0 thrashing at the hands of the Engineers from Lehigh. The Engineers amassed 531 yards of total offense to Davidson’s 85. The Wildcats had the ball in Lehigh territory twice, both results of fumble recoveries, but failed to advance the ball. The ’87 Wildcats are still a young team, but Gatto sees signs of an improving program, despite 13 straight losses dating back to 1985. “We’re significantly better than we were last year,” Gatto emphasized. “We simply have more ability. We just haven’t grown up enough to make the big plays yet.” Gatto led his team onto the gridiron Saturday in the first home game of the season against Colonial League opponent Bucknell. The Wildcat offense could not get on track; consequently, they managed only three points to Bucknell’s thirty-four. Their record dropped to 0-3 with the loss; Davidson’s thirteenth in a row. 

The new season got all the scoring they needed in the first half when sophomore Robert Avinger came out of a crowd of players with the ball and beat the goalie from close range. The teams played very evenly for the rest of the match before the Cats survived a last-minute blast from a U.N.C.C. midfielder that went off the outstretched hands of Kelly before caroming off the crossbar and out of play. Kelly was the tournament MVP and was joined on the all-tournament team by Hankins, Friedlander, and Ott. If the team avoids injury, the remainder of the schedule should follow the early winning trend and allow Slagle to enjoy his eighth season at Davidson to its fullest. The defense will be greatly bolstered by the return of both Kelly and sophomore back Bruce Nofsinger. Spear will again anchor the unit, which is rounded out by another sophomore, Scott Poisson. Additionally, the decision to move Hankins to stopper should add to opposing sides’ goal-scoring woes. The midfield will be comprised of Ott and senior Joe Moss, both of whom will seek to improve on their 1986 seasons. The offense will be powerful, as Friedlander is joined by sophomore Rob Vest, senior Craig Mattison, and highly-touted freshman Peter Cobb. This group should have little trouble finishing Wildcat attacks with goals. Senior Chip Wittman, Avinger, and freshman Ross Saldorini will also play significant roles on this year’s side. With this wealth of talent, Slagle obviously expects a successful campaign. He sees the southern portion of the Southern Conference race as all coming down to the late-season tilt with Furman. This match will be the key as to just how far the Cats go in their quest for the 1987 conference title. Prior to that date though, the team faces such powers as South Carolina and N.C. State in matches which will serve as superb gauges of the team’s capabilities. Slagle hopes these tough matches will prepare the squad for anything which may be encountered along the way.

Sets demanding goals
By KATHRYN MITCHEM

There is a new athletic facility on the rise, there is a new emphasis on women’s sports, and there is a new volleyball program under the leadership of Head Coach Rebecca Hawkins. She comes to Davidson after coaching volleyball and lacrosse for eight years at Randolph Macon, to “try a different place,” to find new challenges. Succeeding last year’s interim coach Sue Hayes, she will have to work to build the new program as she did at Randolph Macon eight years ago. She led that team to a third-place conference ranking and left them with three straight winning seasons. There is no doubt that with her enthusiasm and experience her effect on Davidson’s team will be the same. Coach Hawkins’ main goals for her team’s first year are to become “more solid than last year,” and “to make [the other Southern Conference teams] sweat a little more.” She says, “the team can beat any team on the schedule on any given night.” Their most difficult games, however, will be against Appalachian State and West Carolina and in the tournament at East Tennessee State. Although Davidson is unable to grant volleyball scholarships, the school attracts good, experienced players. There are five returning players: Tami Beckham, Maria Douglas, Sarah Johnson, Kathy McDonald, and Peggy Tietgen; seven freshmen: Amanda Bastian, Molly Graver, Jill Hunter, Anya McDonald, Melissa Meegan, Ellen Ott, and Ingrid Page; and one new junior: Lavetta Dawkins. Composed of four sophomores, two juniors, and seven freshmen, “the team is very young, and that’s good,” says Hawkins, “because we can work with the same group and get some continuity here.” The team played in a non-conference tournament last weekend and played their first conference game Tuesday afternoon, September 15; they were defeated. However, there are twenty-nine matches in a season and plenty of time for future victories. This week, there will be two home conference games, on Monday, Sept. 21 at 6:30 against Marshall, and the other Thursday, September 24 against Western Carolina.
