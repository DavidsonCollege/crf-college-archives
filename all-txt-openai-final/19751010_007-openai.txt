Book thefts deplete library

By DAVE KELLER
Staff Writer

Even though the E.H. Little Library has solved a number of its logistic difficulties with its new computer cataloging system, there is still a major problem which evades solution: stolen books. In last year’s annual inventory alone, there were found to be 304 books missing from the library’s shelves without a trace. As large as this number seems, it is nonetheless mild compared to the totals of 451 and 360 books unaccounted for in the two previous years. Looking at these losses from a financial standpoint, Library Director Leland Park said, “We have to figure a bare minimum of $10.00 each to replace these books. That means losses of at least three or four thousand dollars each year, losses which cut considerably into our annual book budget.” The worst aspect of these thefts is not the financial but rather the fact that a great number of the stolen books are irreplaceable.

New Assistant Dean Dietler laments student lethargy

All it takes is a splashy yellow dress and long strawberry blonde hair worn by a tall, attractive woman for one to realize that they aren’t on Will Terry’s side of the dean’s offices. Instead, you are with the new Assistant Dean of Students, Mary Lou Dietler. Young, enthusiastic, and outgoing, Dietler is a refreshing new addition to the administration. In her position as Assistant Dean of Students, Dietler is conscientious to point out that she is not a new Dean of Women Students. In her opinion, the deans’ offices should reflect a situation that exists in normal society. Men and women aren’t entities divided into segmented worlds - and, consequently, the deans’ offices won’t be either. Although she recognizes the contention that the needs of men and women differ, she feels that a solution to these varying situations can be offered by the particular personality best suited to that specific problem. Consequently, it is not a question of gender as to who one ought to seek out when confronted with a problem.

Dietler’s own history as a student started at Longwood College in Virginia and then later she continued her graduate studies at the University of Virginia. Her various degrees include Math, Counseling, and Business and Educational Administration. When asked to compare her own undergraduate experience with the undergraduate life of today, Dietler particularly noted a change in the political climate of the campuses. Her years in school were spent in the midst of a good deal of political and social upheaval. The Vietnam War with all its ensuing repercussions was of major concern to students. Out of this, political focus was heightened.

For Dietler’s part, as Student Government President, she took an active role as a student legislator in a Virginia state organization for S.G.A. presidents of colleges and universities. Dietler personally chaired the steering committee which concentrated on which issues to focus on in their presentation to the State Legislature. This was a process that was instrumental in the elimination of the necessity for student lobbying.

In contrast, Dietler feels that the concern of the undergraduate today has shifted more in the direction of the increasing job squeeze that will face post-graduate college students. Consequently, in picking majors, students are more likely to orient themselves in a direction that will prove most useful when they have to contend with the tight job market.

Meanwhile, while the Davidson undergrad is still on campus, Dietler explained how she wishes them to view her office. “If you don’t know where to start, this is the place,” was her initial comment. She hoped the office would be a place where any student would feel free to go under any circumstances. She also feels it can act as a liaison between students and faculty. The office works in an advisory and counseling capacity and basically as a campus humanization unit, goals which Dietler is looking forward to fulfilling.Few of these books can be bought from out-of-print book dealers, but the cost of labor in finding such books plus their inflated cost makes this proposition at times very impractical,” said Park. “Added to this is the fact that because of the current economic situation, many publishers are publishing individual editions in much smaller numbers, often making replacement virtually impossible. Lack of funds in individual departments, which pay one-half the price of books they wish replaced, is also a limiting factor. 

“The blame,” said Park, “is not leveled at any one group of library users, but on thoughtless and irresponsible people in general.” He also said that, in the past, there was evidence of professional theft of expensive books; this problem has evidently disappeared, though. The potential solution to this problem is simple: monitoring library users as they enter and leave. This can be done in two ways, electronically by means of a system which consists of magnetically sensitizing each library book and placing sensors at the exit, or manually by placing a guard at the library exit who will search each leaving user. Both of these methods are quite expensive: around $50,000 initially and $2,000 each year for the first, and about $18,000 annually for the second. 

The E. H. Little is one of the few unmonitored libraries of its size left, and Park hopes to keep it that way. “A free library is very much a privilege, and exists mainly because of the honor system,” said Park. “Freedom at the door will last as long as we want it to last. I hope that our library doesn’t become as others I’ve been in, where a user is seen as a potential thief as soon as he enters the door; things are so much better here, where I find it a pleasure to work for and with people who are honorable and have a sense of responsibility.”

The cost of attending medical school has risen sharply over the last decade. To many medical students, that cost represents a heavy burden, a financial problem that can affect your concentration. It needn't be that way. The Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarship Program was originated to free you from those worries. Men and women who qualify will have the costs of their medical education covered, and will also receive a substantial monthly allowance. The program offers more than tuition and salary; it offers you the opportunity to begin your practice under very favorable conditions. 

As a health care officer in the military branch of your choice, you'll find yourself with responsibilities fully in keeping with your training, and with the time and opportunity to observe a full spectrum of medical specialties. When you decide on the specialty you wish to pursue, you may find yourself taking those graduate medical studies at one of our many large and modern medical centers. If so, you can count on that training being second to none. Both the clinical and research work being done in them have made Army, Navy, and Air Force hospitals a major new national medical resource. It's a long road, but the first step is simple. Just send in the coupon. The details we send you may make the whole way a little smoother.
