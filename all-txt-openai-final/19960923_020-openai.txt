20 THE DAVIDSONIAN BACK PAGE INTERVIEW MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 1996

On her way to becoming Ambassador to the Republic of Zambia, Arlene Render stops by Davidson to discuss the future of Burundi and Rwanda, the foreign service, and caring about her fellow man.

**What is the most significant problem facing Burundi today?**

The most significant problem facing Burundi today is the question of ethnicity and democratic maintenance. By that, I mean Burundi is at a crossroads in trying to remain stable to avoid a horrific imminent crisis ultimately that could lead to genocide. So, I think there are political solutions to their problems so they can avoid this tremendous and voracious problem.

**What effects do the “Somalia syndrome” as well as the lack of international intervention in Rwanda have on current U.S. policy in Burundi?**

I don’t think that these two events have a significant impact on U.S. foreign policy in Burundi. By that, I mean that the people who are engaged in trying to find a solution to Burundi’s problems are looking at it from a point of view of what is best for Burundi and what we can do. Clearly, no one in the United States nor the world wants to see another Rwanda genocide. Therefore, we have always focused our efforts on prevention, crisis management, trying to encourage the Burundians to find solutions to the problems that face them. This is not easy, we know. We have sent people to the region: National Security Advisor Anthony Lake, our U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Madeleine Albright, the Deputy Secretary of State Vincent Talbart — he was named a presidential envoy for Rwanda and Burundi and the Great Lakes. We have a coordinator for Burundi. [These are] people who are focusing their attention not only on Burundi specifically but the subregion of the Great Lakes. They are working not only with the people in Burundi and Rwanda and Zaire, but also the chiefs of state surrounding this area of the Great Lakes as well as other interested persons such as Jimmy Carter and others who are strongly interested in helping Burundi find solutions to their problems.

**Along those same lines, what effect do you think the sanctions will have?**

I hope they (and I believe they are) having a positive effect on at least pushing the current military leaders. I think they are having a positive impact in trying to get them to restore their democratic institutions in Burundi with financial incentives. And I think it’s because of steps where African nations gain belief in trying to help other African nations resolve their problems.

**Do you foresee U.S. troops intervening in Burundi to help them change to a democratic, stable social state?**

I personally do not see that. But I could see a whole host of nations coming together for humanitarian efforts. I think that what we want to do is pursue an African solution to an African problem. I think that’s what everyone, the OAU ... the countries of Tanzania, Uganda, and in the area, are trying to work with Burundi on this problem. So I think that is what you want to see, rather than have us go in with an Operation Support Hope type of mission.

**You began your career in health administration. What motivated you to switch to the Foreign Service and what impact has your [health-related] experience had on your [current] work?**

It is true that my first job after I graduated from university and received my master's in public health was working as a public health educator in the city of Cleveland. I have always maintained an interest in history... I like history. I am also very interested in how events impact our lives. And it was that interest that sparked my interest in the Foreign Service in wanting to at least try out a new career. And so I joined the Foreign Service with the thought in mind of giving it a try for at least a few years and perhaps going back to public health. But I found that because the Foreign Service is a profession whereby you change countries every two to three years — in fact, every two or three years I had a new job and new experiences and new challenges. And therefore I have remained. I think that my experiences in public health did help me in a number of ways. Number one, in the management of programs and people. But more importantly, it also made me aware beyond the political and economic issues that countries are grappling with — to also be aware of and focus on some of the social issues that are there. And clearly health issues and social issues and...

Ms. Arlene Render, former director of Central Africa to Burundi, has witnessed firsthand the horrific toils of the Burundi people through her foreign service. She has stood by the people through collaboration and with time, people will find peace within themselves, and finally put aside their wrath of hate and prejudice. Ms. Render fervently believes that people should take responsibility. Many people contribute a great deal to our world, and we are just a part of it, and so it is wonderful to experience the flavors that are out there.Issues such as the environment are more and more coming to the fore in our times. So I think it is a very useful tool to have in one’s bailiwick. Clearly, when you are talking to physicians and others, when they know you have a background in public health, they feel they are talking to someone who’s credible (laugh), someone they can understand. So it has been useful and helpful to have as part of my background.

You have been on assignment on four continents, is that correct? I have spent my time in four major areas. I have spent the majority of my career in Africa. I had a tour in Iran. I had a tour in Cape de Ver. I had a tour in the Caribbean where I was Counsel General in Jamaica. So I have been to a number of places. But I have spent the majority of my career in the Africa Bureau; that is my choice... and I haven’t regretted a minute of it. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time there.

Your varying interests and experiences serving in the foreign service have taken you all over the world. You have been on assignment on four continents. As a result of your extensive travels, what have you gained from these diverse places and cultures? We all have ways of achieving a goal. It is important to realize that we have many ways of achieving that goal. We learn techniques, we learn problem-solving ventures, and encounter new people. So, I look at strength for all of us, and it has been good and positive. Many people contribute a great deal to our world, and we are just a part of it, and so it is wonderful to experience the flavors that are out there.

What has been your most exciting assignment? In the foreign service, we say that our most important assignment is our first assignment. I think it is because, like anything else, it’s the first time you experience significant foreign roles and I enjoyed most of my tours for different reasons. But I thoroughly enjoy looking back at my first tour in Cape De Ver; I guess it is my favorite.

Ambassador Brown has described you as an excellent role model. What would you wish others to gain from your life experiences? Well, I hope that individuals will look at me and say two things: One, if you work hard you can achieve something, and, two, she cares about her fellow man and she hopes that people will work together to achieve common interests.

How can anyone with limited knowledge of Africa get involved and make a positive impact specifically on the crisis in Burundi or in the context of the foreign service in general? I think most people have the nature of seeing events that affect their lives, but some foreign events are too far away for a number of individuals. Clearly, I find most Americans relate to seeing different problems of the world on the television. However, they are keenly interested and want to get involved. They want to make contributions, they want to figure out how they can help and they do help.

How can people become interested in foreign affairs? I think by reading the newspaper, attending lectures, such as those sponsored by the Dean Rusk Program in International Studies. I think travel also sparks an interest in international affairs. So, there are multiple ways. But, generally speaking, we tend to, all of us, be more concerned with those things that affect our lives now. A message is presented to us, a number of us do not look beyond that, but I think in general there is a great deal of interest in different world events.

Where do you see Burundi in five to ten years? Burundi is a very complex issue, but the optimistic view of Burundi would be that by two or three years from now, they would be able to heal all the deadly positions they have. I hope that they succeed, but I know that for people it takes time to heal the cohesiveness of society. But if we can avoid an ethnic bloodbath, a genocide, to me that’s a step in the positive direction. And I think that’s what we should work towards getting. We should help them with their development. Burundi is a country which has enough rain and enough variation of temperature that it could almost grow anything. It clearly should be focusing on economic potential. This would create jobs for the people, focus less on the things that divide them and focus more on the things that unite them.
