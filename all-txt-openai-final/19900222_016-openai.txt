Hoops head into tournaments; spring sports soon

By QUINN McCUTCHEN

The post-season basketball tournaments are well underway and the street hockey tournament is ready to begin. Lots of exciting, competitive intramural action took place last week.

In the men’s B league tournament, six teams still remain. The first round was completed last week with Morning Dru immunizing White Man’s Disease 44 to 27, Third Beast mauling Second East Belk 38 to 33, and We Hope We Win giving up any chance of winning by forfeiting to the Cousins. In round two, the King Cobras rolled against Iming 57 to 49, the Moon Dogs glazed 2nd West Ham 42 to 38, Morning Dru tamed Third Beast 37 to 30, and the Cousins clipped Jerry Curl and the Activators 38 to 36.

Round three saw the King Cobras eclipse the Moon Dogs 41 to 38 and the Cousins give Morning Dru a 38 to 18 rude awakening. In the losers’ bracket, 2nd West Ham defeated Iming 52 to 36 and 3rd Beast beat Jerry Curl and the Activators. Exciting B league matches to come... 2nd West Ham faces Morning Dru, the Moon Dogs battle Third Beast, and the King Cobras meet the Cousins.

In the women’s tournament, the Sea Hags bombed the Third Rich POs 45 to 34 and BOYC accepted a forfeit from Brant’s Beauties. This week Third Rich faces BOYC.

Four teams remain in the men’s A league basketball tournament. The first round was completed with the Nice Guys beating Prime Times 38 to 30 and B.O.B. doubling the Old Men 68 to 34. In round two, Mike’s Back squashed the All Stars 56 to 38 and the Nice Guys rolled by B.O.B. 45 to 39. In the losers’ bracket, DFWB slipped by the Docs O’ Dunk 53 to 51, the Prime Times eliminated the Old Men 49 to 41, B.O.B. outscored DFWB 43 to 33, and the All Stars hogtied Prime Times 59 to 36. This week, B.O.B. meets the All Stars and Mike’s Back faces the Nice Guys.

Pairings are complete and the street hockey tournament is ready to begin. The Harpoon Platoon battles Rusk, the Close Doors meet the Calimere Brothers, In Your Crease faces the Puckers, and Lemieux squares off against the Broad Street Bullies.

The Spring sports of volleyball, softball, and team handball will be starting soon. IMAC president Pete Harding and IMAC secretary Judy Krenzer have been disappointed in freshman participation. They have received only two freshman rosters for softball and volleyball and none for team handball. Harding and Krenzer have issued an impassioned plea for more participation from freshmen. Unfortunately, the deadline for softball rosters has already come and gone. However, the deadline for volleyball and handball rosters has been extended until this Friday.
