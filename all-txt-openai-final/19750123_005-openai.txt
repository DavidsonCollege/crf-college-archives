Five Faculty Guest Column
Missionaries Discuss Living With Natives
By LAUREN W. YODER
Professor of French

(During my recent trip to Zaire, I overheard the following conversation between Kondo and Sefu, two Katangese. Kondo had just returned to his home village after a two-year stint serving his country as an ATZ (Assistance Technique Zairoise) volunteer in the United States. The success of the American Peace Corps effort had stimulated the establishment of a similar organization in Kinshasa, and Kondo had been one of thirty-five young Zairois in the first contingent of volunteers eagerly accepted by the States.)

--Tell me Kondo, what kind of work do ATZ volunteers do in America?
--Well, Sefu, of course our real work was for the ACI (Agence Clandestine de l’Intelligence). Our front was teaching Swahili and Lingala. We spent a great deal of our time inventing modern Bantu names for Tutsi-like native athletes.
--Speaking of the natives, what are they really like?
--It’s hard to describe them, Sefu, but they are friendly and welcome anything we can teach them.
--Are they really as ignorant and uncivilized as people say?
--I’m afraid so. Your average American can’t build a fire, communicate by drum, or weave a raffia mat.
--Unbelievable.
--Yes, but we hope that our two-year stay has helped at least the younger ones.
--And their religion, Kondo. Is it really as weird as missionaries say?
--Well, Sefu, as near as I can figure, they worship a being called GNP, who exacts a terrible tribute.
--How benighted!
--Yes, and to placate him, they pour tons of poisons into their air and water.
--I guess you have to boil and strain the water before you drink it.
--No. It’s not worth boiling. The DDT and radioactive materials would still remain. But Americans never drink plain water anyway. They always add sugars and dyes to disguise its real taste and appearance.
--How horrible to drink such filthy stuff.
--What’s worse, many Americans spend their weekends playing in it and dipping their kids in it.
--Where do the poisons come from?
--Well of course they don’t consider them dangerous. But think for a minute. Each member of every

Defending Partisan Politics

All my life I have witnessed a general dislike for partisan politics among my acquaintances and most friends. Only my family and their friends in politics ever spoke for partisanship in politics. Most people I know say “I vote for the man not the party.” This is said with vigor and is meant to indicate they are thinkers and not followers of the herd. Now I feel most of these people are intelligent but do not invoke a great deal of intellectual effort when they consider politics. They are casually concerned about government and the political process. Those who are concerned are usually more respectful of the roles the two parties play.

While I may be in a minority, I feel our two-party system is a workable and admirable process. To agree with me you would first have to grant that the maintenance of structure in any human society is vastly difficult, especially if you allow for individual freedoms. Next, you must try to visualize another group such as psychologists or sociologists running the system. I have, and I find the prospect ghastly.

In 1952 and 1956, more people voted “for the man” than at any time in the last generation. A review of this country’s development during the 1950s should cause anyone to question voting for the individual as an intelligent comment. Eisenhower could not and did not function well without organized (party) support. The opposition party dominated the congress, and although it was not openly antagonistic, the President had not the relationship with them to develop progressive programs. The man without the party is seriously handicapped.

This country has two compatible parties. A shift of power does not create chaos. One is not extremely liberal and the other extremely conservative. Both parties have within them the full range of political commitments. Thus each party is tempered from destructive radicalism. There are those who wish a more clearly defined set of parties. Such a situation usually generates several parties (as in France and Italy). This does not usually serve the population in a steady fashion. I want adaptability in my government. I want one which will operate with some smoothness although it will often be slow and less dramatic.

It is difficult to listen to men like David Brinkley sneer continuously at processes that serve us well if fallibly. This is one column that seeks to defend something that will receive hundreds of published criticisms. Many of the criticisms are required and improvements are definitely needed. Sneers are never needed.clan must keep three light bulbs burning continuously. 

--Light bulbs? 

--Yes, the glowing presence of GNP enclosed in a glass. But GNP refuses to show his presence unless power stations dump coal smoke and radioactivity into the air. 

--And how about their autos? 

--Right, there’s another example, at the heart of their religion, another manifestation of GNP. The vehicles roll around, pausing frequently to guzzle offerings awaiting them at pumps along their service trails. Americans pray daily to the East to keep them rolling. 

--Poor savages. 

--Don’t be too hard on them, Sefu. One learns to appreciate their lack of sophistication. And they have made great contributions to the progress of mankind. 

--Like what? 

--Like the 60-hour work week. 

--Boy, can we thank our lucky stars. But for a geographical accident, we could have been born in an overdeveloped country.

Prolific Rousch Brandishes Acrid Pen

I always questioned the honesty of prefatory assertions in ambitious novels that all characters are purely fictional, and any resemblance to persons living or dead is not intended. Only a guilty conscience has excuses ready before the charge. 

If I could find a ghost writer, or if the ghost of a writer in me could someday take shape, I have a character drawn from the living who is too good to tamper with. What I have glimpsed of his life is too intriguing for any trait to be lost in recreation. Chronic scanners of “Letters to the Editor” columns in area newspapers may be familiar with this character: He signs himself Lawrence C. Rousch. Approximately once a month, a letter from Mr. Rousch appears in the Charlotte paper, another in Durham, another in Raleigh, and occasionally he splashes big in the Washington Post. 

Mr. Rousch is a crusader. His favorite targets are God, Billy Graham, and the National Rifle Association. His latest letter in the Observer applauded the decision of a Charlotte church to redirect building funds to feed the hungry. The bulk of the letter attacked belief in a God who could allow suffering in the world. 

I met Mr. Rousch several years ago while working afternoons in a small office supply company. He bears a vague likeness to Henry Kissinger (a comparison that would appall him), though shorter and with dancing bright eyes. A faded muffler always draped about his heavy overcoat that smelled of rich pipe tobacco. Mr. Rousch would appear once a month in the store to make photocopies of his latest letters. He mounted them very carefully on cardboard sheets, complete with the newspaper title and date. The bulk of his collection was impressive. His work (of which he never spoke and I never asked) brought him to town once a month, and his one excursion away from the motel and restaurant was to our copy machine and our conversations. Business would lag in the late afternoon, but on the days of his visits, I would cease to count the minutes on the clock. Mr. Rousch would appear with a bright greeting and proceed to show me his latest efforts. Letter writing was his hobby and passion. I have met few men with such a blend of good humor, intelligence, and uncompromising rationalism. His favorite topics were education and social reform. Mr. Rousch was undaunted in his faith that man could improve this world with his mind. His foes were anything that he felt clouded this mind. Supernaturalism in any form, prejudice, ignorance, all received his lash. But bleak as his letters often read, the lash was dealt gently. 

One of the ladies in the store was of the persuasion, among other things, that the astronauts on the moon were messing up the weather. Mr. Rousch had great fun with her, especially as they debated the authenticity of the Gospels. Yet he always had a twinkle in his eye. After his visits, she would ask me with a concerned frown what I thought of a man like that. I would glance at the copy of the letter he had left me, something like a silver bullet, and smile. 

Meeting Mr. Rousch was a reassuring experience. Finding a traveling salesman (as I always imagined him) in the wastes of eastern North Carolina who locked horns with all the gods of that region was amazing at that age and this. His battles are conducted on a field of eccentrics, the Letters column. Yet his voice is sane, pleading at monthly intervals. Prejudiced in his own whimsical way, Mr. Rousch plugs away for the power of the mind, but sinks his playful bite into the power of positive thinking. Mr. Rousch is akin to a body of surprising characters who think for themselves. He surprised Stamps.
