**College Carries Commitment To ROTC**
By DON BENSON
Associate Editor

“Davidson College is committed to Army ROTC,” explained Vice President for Academic Affairs John M. Bevan. “The college has always
felt the need to see a portion of our officer corps coming from a liberal arts background. We feel that
a liberal arts education gives the individual a perspective which is useful in many fields, the army included.”

Davidson College spends approximately $3000 per year on the Army ROTC operation in the basement of Belk dormitory. The U.S.
Government spends $10,000 per year beyond the payment of staff salaries for this program.

During the Vietnam War, there was a vocal effort to have Army ROTC programs removed from college campuses. With the
volunteer army now accelerating its advertising and promotions, the trends are unclear as to what the future enrollment levels of
ROTC may be.

The present staff of Davidson’s Army ROTC department consists of five officers, six enlisted men, and one civilian. The program
lost an officer from its staff last year. Two enlisted men will not be replaced when they leave this summer.
Lt. Col. Kenneth D. Allen, Maj. Clarence Grant, and Capt. Abel White are leaving this summer but will be replaced.
Bevan explained, “The army recommends a list of people for such positions. We check their qualifications and express a choice.
The college has a definite hand in the selection process.”

The ROTC staff has on occasion assumed coaching duties for Davidson College teams in such areas as riflery and swimming.
They have never been used to share academic duties outside of the ROTC program.

As head of the ROTC program centered at Davidson, Col. William C. Simpson said, “Our facilities here are some of
the better in the Southeast. We have three classrooms, an area for drafting and map making, what I consider a
secure arms room, a cadet lounge, a firing range in the basement of Belk, and access to the College’s athletic
fields. We are also constructing a ‘slide for life cable’ over a cove at the college’s lake campus.”

Simpson echoed the need for an ROTC program in liberal arts colleges. “The first consideration has of course been the
number of people we are talking about. It would be unfeasible to expect West Point to turn out the number
of officers needed by the army. There has also been a traditional desire for individuals with a liberal arts education
to balance the talents of the professionally trained soldier.”

Bevan acknowledged that questions can be raised as to the purpose of military training in a liberal arts curriculum. “It
is hard to draw a sharp line between what is pre-professional and what is liberal arts. I don’t see how
anyone could object to ROTC on those grounds while the college offers courses like Organic Chemistry or Experimental Psychology. These
are courses that are heavily weighted towards a professional orientation.”

**The Davidsonian ceases publication for the winter term with this issue. We will resume publication March 13. The editors and
staff wish everyone a happy spring break.**

and inspections were held regularly. kind of preparation.” Davidson College currently has 93 students enrolled in ROTC. 23 are seniors,
25 are juniors, 19 sophomores, and 26 freshpersons. This includes two female sophomores and one female freshperson. Around 43 percent
of Davidson students do not continue ROTC into their junior and senior years. This compares with the national average of
about 60 percent. The first two years of ROTC involve no obligation for the student. The freshman course meets once
a week during all three terms, in addition to leadership laboratory taken during the fall or spring terms. The sophomore
course meets twice a week for two terms in addition to a lab in the fall or spring terms. Junior
and senior cadets meet four times a week during any one of the terms in addition to a lab in
the fall or spring. A six-week summer camp is required, usually attended after the junior year. These students receive $100
per academic month and are commissioned upon graduation as second lieutenants. Cadets have several options in fulfilling their commitments. The
most popular alternatives being (1) a three to six month period of active duty followed by eight years in the
ready reserve, or (2) two years of active duty with four years spent in the reserves. Davidson students are almost
equally divided in their choices between these two. Simpson added, “Everyone received their choices last year.”

Davidson has 47 out of 93 students on full ROTC scholarships. “This is an exceptionally good amount,” said Simpson. The
student must retain a C average and meet his commitments to keep his aid. The scholarship provides for all academic
expenses including books, lab fees, and any equipment needed. The student can receive grants of one, two, three, or four
years. The four-year grant requires four years of active duty and two years in reserves after graduation. The ROTC staff
is not restricted to conducting a program for Davidson students. Through the Charlotte consortium, Army ROTC is taught to the
students of seven other participating schools. These include Belmont Abbey, Barber Scotia, Central Piedmont Community College, J.C. Smith University, Mitchell
College, UNCC, and Wingate. Bilateral agreements also offer such opportunities to Mitchell College, Gardner Webb, and Pfeiffer. These non-Davidson students
have the option of coming to Davidson or attending Thursday and Friday classes conducted at the Army Reserve Center in
Charlotte. The final course of instruction must be taken by all students at the Davidson campus.

“There are going to be people who feel that they want to offer something to their country. It is a
good opportunity to keep one’s options open. A student may need a little time to grow when he graduates. The
Army can give you a chance to do this, to see the world and also be supporting yourself.”
