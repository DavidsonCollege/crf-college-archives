THE REAL PERSPECTIVES SECTION

Toga Party Lands
Classics Dept. On

Social Probation

CHAMBERS LAWN - Clas-
sics Professor Michael K. Touma-
zou has been charged with holding
an unregistered Toga Party, serv-
ing fermented honey and water to
untenured faculty, and violating
Chambers noise decibel levels with
the sonorous strains of his lyre.

Released from his holding cell
this morning, Toumazou, a legend
in his native Cyprus, told report-
ers, “We were only having a standard
Wednesday night bacchanal wor-
ship of Dionysus. There weren’t
even any sacrifices.”

Said campus police officer
Haynes: “This isn’t Parnassus. We
have rules here. You can’t just have
an unregistered symposium and
expect to get away with it. Plato
would have banished you from the
Republic.”

McCain is a good man, and Obama is also a great man.

Bro Perseveres Through Dance
Ensemble Without the Use of
Performance-Enhancing Drugs

In a phenomenal feat of endur-
ance, iron man Andrew Bivens ’10
retained consciousness through-
out not one, but two entire Dance
Ensemble performances. Immedi-
ately after the second show he was
rushed to Lake Norman Hospital,
where doctors pushed intravenous
fluids in an attempt to avoid perma-
nent kidney damage.

The following day nurses tested
his blood and urine for such perfor-
mance-enhancing drugs as smell-
ing salts, Red Bull, amphetamines
and EPO. Shockingly, all tests
came back negative.

When asked in a post-game
press conference how he trained for
this event, Bivens said, “Obviously
I practiced all the traditional meth-
ods like watching Broadway musi-
cals and ‘Fosse,’ but I think what
really put me ahead of the competi-
tion was the extra tape sessions of
Olympic ribbon dancing.”

On Dec. 7 The National Orga-
nization for Women (NOW) will be
celebrating Bivens’s achievements
by presenting him with a certificate
of achievement for “unparalleled
courage and endurance in the face
of social norms and the understand-
able desire to pass the hell out dur-
ing extremely contrived and poorly
choreographed dance routines.”

Unfortunately, there are no
credible witnesses that can attest to
Andrew’s accomplishment because
all the other males that went to the
show don’t remember anything
past the first piece, which is widely
accepted as the traditional time to
nod off.

After two arrests and three stints
in rehab, “Failure to Launch” star
Matthew McConaughey is finally
coming to terms with his violent
desire to exhibit his pectorals at

Getting Over Grad
School Workshop

THE UNION - Too depressing-
ly average for Harvard Law? Lack-
ing the motivation for Kenan-
Flagler? Too many misdemeanors
for Duke Divinity? Not everyone
can get into a top-tier graduate pro-
gram, and with your mediocre GPA,
oddly formatted resume, lukewarm
recommendation letters and limp
handshake, you too are likely ear-
marked for rejection.

Don’t worry. Career Services
has just the workshop for you.
Tuesday evening they will host Da-
vidson’s first workshop on how to
cope with your inevitable rejection
from the graduate program of your
choice, and how to live with the
probability that you will get your
MBA from a third-rate Indiana
commuter school.

So you got a seven on your
GRE. No biggie. With an array of
tissues, medicine balls and Chicken
Soup for the Mediocre Soul therapy
books, the Career Services office is
ready to prepare you for your im-
minent lack of a career.

Some of you may still be fo-
cused on the Getting Into Grad
School Workshop. That’s okay. It’s
only natural that the first stage of
your mediocre career should be de-
nial. Congrats, you picked David-
son and now you’re paying for it.

‘Grow-a-SAAC’

Campaign Drops

the Ball... Again

To no one’s surprise, the SAAC race
was yet again poorly attended.

The Student Athlete Advisory
Committee has expressed disap-
pointment in its inability to expand
its campus representation through
its “Grow-a-SAAC” campaign.

“I don’t think students fully re-
alize the potency of a fully loaded
SAAC,” Jeremy Wilkins said. “A
mature SAAC would help David-
son obliterate Furman, UNCG and
other SoCon schools.”

The SAAC has been shriveling
since last winter’s frigid lack of par-
ticipation. However, by expanding
representation to two members per
varsity team, the SAAC hopes to
revitalize participation through its
new “Grow-a-Pair” initiative.
