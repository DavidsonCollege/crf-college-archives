KA was shut down this week for violating new member laws.

KA removed from
campus until 2007

By Liz BARRY
Editor-in-Chief

Kappa Alpha Order fraternity
was shut down this week due to
violations of Patterson Court’s
New Member Bill of Rights. The
earliest KA might return to campus
is the fall of 2007.

KA was charged with violating
13 of 31 possible regulations,
said Vice President and Dean of
Students Tom Shandley.

The New Member Bill of Rights
stipulates that violations occur
when new members of fraternities
or eating houses are
“required/expected or even
‘strongly encouraged’” to perform
certain prohibited activities. KA’s
violations involved activities that
prevented pledges from “securing
normal amounts of sleep” and
caused them to “miss or be ill pre-
pared for class.” Activities involv-
ing the illegal consumption of alco-
hol by new members also took
place.

Following the first week of
spring break, several family mem-
bers of pledges complained to the
administration. After hearing the
allegations, Shandley held a meet-
ing with the officers of KA.

“To their credit, they called a
meeting that night, sat down with
active members and came back
with a list of violations,” Shandley
said. “Once confronted, they were
very cooperative with coming
forth.”

New neighbors on the Patterson Court scene

By EMILY KOHN
Senior Staff Writer

The Patterson Court house that
formerly belonged to CoHo will be
available for use by another student
organization next semester.

According to Patterson Court
advisor Joy Hamm, PCC is putting
the final touches on its application
policy for groups that want to use
the house. PCC plans to vote on the
policy on Apr. 3.

The final decision will be up to
President Bobby Vagt.

Student organizations are
already planning to apply for the
house.

Alpha Phi Alpha president
Brendan Watkins ’07 said that his
fraternity planned to submit a pro-
posal.

Gay Straight Alliance (GSA)
president Sam Hotchkiss ’08 also
plans to apply, although he is
uncertain whether the GSA has the
funds and members to qualify.

“Many other schools similar to
Davidson in terms of location and
academic rigor have meeting
spaces designed specifically for
their GSAs,” Hotchkiss said. “If
we had the CoHo house, we would
set it up as a ‘Queer Union,’ basi-
cally a safe place for students to
come, hang out, and talk about
issues surrounding sexuality. We
would also use the space to host
regularly scheduled meetings and,
who knows, maybe the occasional
court party.”

There also exists much buzz sur-
rounding the possibility of bringing
the Outpost back to Patterson
Court.

The Outpost used to be the on-campus site for late-night dining.

The Outpost was a student-run
late-night food service located on
Patterson Court that closed once
the Knobloch Campus Center
opened in the spring of 2001.

No current Davidson students
were enrolled when the Outpost
existed, making it difficult to
appreciate the passion many alum-
ni felt for the former service.

“We all figured that when we left

Committee begins process to
select Pan-Hellenic sorority

By COLLEEN McKown
Senior Staff Writer

National Pan-Hellenic Council
(NPHC) Alpha Kappa Alpha and
Zeta Phi Beta sororities begin to
visit Davidson this week in order to
provide information regarding their
organizations.

NPHC sororities are historically
black organizations that emphasize
diversity and service. There are
four sororities in the NPHC.

Alpha Kappa Alpha (AKA) was
the first historically black sorority
in the United States.

The organization was founded at
Howard University in 1908 and
promotes leadership, scholarship
and service.

The IVY AKAdemy is one of the
service hallmarks of Alpha Kappa
Alpha; the academy seeks to pro-
mote scholastic achievement in
youth.

Alice Frimpong ’08, who has
been heavily involved in the soror-
ity initiative, is attracted to Alpha
Kappa Alpha because of the
“strong female leaders of integrity
and its vision of service that
extends internationally.”

“Influential women such as
Coretta Scott King, Rosa Parks,
Toni Morrison and Maya Angelou
are members of AKA,” said
Frimpong.

She is also impressed by the
sorority’s service work in Africa.
AKA started the African Village
Development Program in 1984,
established Ivy AKAdemy in South
Africa in 2000 and built nine
schools in 2002.

Zeta Phi Beta was founded in
1920 as a progressive organization.

The sorority was founded to give
support to black women at a time
when they were repressed in socie-
ty. Zeta Phi Beta emphasizes
“scholarship, service, sisterly love,
and finer womanhood.”

Zetas Helping Other People
Excel (Z-HOPE), an outreach serv-
ice program, provides cultural
informational activities and sup-
ports community service organiza-
tions.

Their “Stork’s Nest Program”
provides incentives that promote
healthy behavior during pregnancy.

After the idea for bringing a
NPHC sorority to Davidson was
approved by President Vagt last
semester, a selection committee
was set up to carry the issue for-
ward.

Vice President for Business and
Finance Karen Goldstein heads the
committee. Patterson Court
