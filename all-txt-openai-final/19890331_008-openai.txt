Desideratum: Mecca to Heptonstall

What it must have felt like.

To see a child smile in dawn’s blue

Where milk bottles rattled on Selwyn steps
Or smell the cinders of stellar collisions

Stretching weird whiteness across
Light years.
I do not know.

Stars and gas planets must have swirled
Spun sagas in your sleep.

You knew cold’s diamond penetration
When winter crouched bitter-cruel,

Frigid in the fertile dark where
Your soul sang radiant.

This mecca seems most clean and simple.
These pebbles, the polished

Mirrors of your obscure tragedy,

Like Clytemnestra’s labris, blood-laced,
Scream beauty in the July sun.

How you seized subtle miracles

Sudden and vague, strange:

Like the smile of some fantastic colored butterfly,
Blown vermillion in summer twilight.
