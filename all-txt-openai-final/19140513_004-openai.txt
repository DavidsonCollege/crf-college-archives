4 THE DAVIDSONIAN, May 13, 1914

BASEBALL SEASON ENDS IN VICTORY.
(Continued from page 1)

Carolina had a well-balanced team and showed that they had able coaching under “Gi” Guerrant. “Babe” Adams, who relieved “Big” Mills, pitched a good game. Shuler, at third; Edens, at first; and Plexico, in center field, all played a fine game. For Davidson, the pitching of Osteen stood out prominently, while Elliott, behind the plate, caught a great game. The batting of the entire team also featured. Stough made a difficult catch in center. Crayton nipped a liner before it could touch, and Somerville made a beautiful bare-hand stop at second. The game throughout was full of ginger. Dave Heywood, one of the fastest men in the South, had to be carried off the field when he sprained his knee sliding back to first.

The score by innings:
R H E
Davidson . . . 321 000 30x—9 12 4
U. of S.C. . . . 100 020 001—4 3 7

Batteries: Osteen and Elliott; Mills, Adams, and Stoney. Struck out, by Osteen, 9; by Adams, 4. Hits, off Osteen, 3; off Mills, 5. 3-base hits, Christenbury, Brown, Lott. 2-base hits, Withrington, Crayton. Stolen base, Christenbury. Umpire, Prim; Scorer, Williams.

FRESHMEN WIN BASEBALL CUP.
The Fresh team won the Baseball Cup last Saturday when they defeated the Junior team. McDonald, with a sprained ankle, pitched a great game for the Juniors.

The score by innings:
R H E
Junior . . . . 100 020 001—4 8 5
Sophs . . . . 102 210 14x—9 14 3

Batteries: McDonald and Boggs; W. J. Smith and Thames.

THE SEASON REVIEWED.
When the curtain fell on the 1914 baseball campaign, a “good taste” was left for every Davidsonian, when one of our greatest rivals was overwhelmingly defeated. Both in football and in baseball, Davidson almost invariably has the good luck of closing the season in either a victory or a string of victories—making a grand finale, as it were. Looking at the season as a whole, it has been a credit to Davidson, and except for the bad breaking of luck in several of the early games, it would have been a glorious success. For next year, the prospects are the brightest that Davidson has ever had, for only one man on the team will graduate, and therefore, everyone else should be back, and Davidson should put out the best team that has ever represented this College, and should easily win the South Atlantic championship. Besides the present Varsity and Scrub men, there should be several good men in the Class of 1918.

ATHLETIC NOTES.
At a meeting of the Athletic Executive Committee, it was decided to sell season tickets next year for Football, Baseball, and Track for $5.00. This is a very reasonable amount in view of the fact that the holder will get fully that amount in games on the Hill.

The moving picture show will be run next year by Enoch Faw and Lex Kluetz for the joint benefit of the Annual and the Athletic Association.

The Track team elected Gilchrist captain for next year, and N. Johnson manager.

Glancing back over the season, we recall the fact that the early part of the season this locality had much snow and rain, and the field being of clay, it was rendered unfit for service for some time. This was a great handicap to the team, and Coach especially, since several new players had to be developed. “Practice makes perfect,” but when a team can't practice, it can't become perfect. This fact, together with the fact that many of the big games came at the start of the season, is responsible for several of the games lost by a very close score. After the team did get to going good, it was hard to stop them. Out of the last 6 games, 5 of them were won by a good margin, and the other was lost in one inning when several errors were made. Three of these victories were over three of our biggest rivals—U. of N. C., Wake Forest, and U. of S.C. As the season neared its end, the team got better and better until in its final shape it is to be much doubted whether any team in the South Atlantic could win over the “Red and Black Machine.” One thing that must be said of the entire team is that they had plenty of the old-time Davidson pep.and in every single game they put up a scrappy and peppery game until the last ball was thrown.

LETTERS AWARDED.

The following received their “D” for meritorious services this spring in baseball: Those receiving for the first time were Christenbury, Stough, Elliott, and Somerville. For the second year, Capt. Crayton, Brown, Withrington, and Osteen. For the third consecutive season, Kluttz.

* * *

Captain Crayton has made a splendid leader for the team, and in every game of pep. Christenbury leads the team in the number of scores made. Davidson during the season tallied 80 runs to our opponents’ 47, and of this number, Christy made 15. He also leads in walking, taking 8 trips by this route. He and Kluttz tie in the number of bases stolen, each getting 11. Out of his 14 hits, he secured 3 doubles and a triple. Somerville was second in the number of bases on balls. Brown leads the team with the stick at .368. Out of his 7 hits, he secured a double and a triple. The pitching staff has been strong this year with Osteen and Currie. They have both pitched superb ball throughout the season. Murphy had a blistered finger and was sick at the first of the season, which kept him from pitching more games. In the first U. of S. C. and Wake Forest games, he showed that he had plenty of stuff. Osteen has pitched the majority of games and has certainly pitched great ball and worked hard. Bill has been chosen as captain for next year and well deserves this honor. Stough leads in heavy hitting and in the number of hits. Out of his 20, he got 5 doubles and 6 triples. Kluttz tied Christenbury for the number of bases stolen and was second in batting. Out of 18 hits, he secured 2 doubles and 4 triples. There were 9 “D. C.'s” awarded to the following: A. S. Anderson, W. Noel Smith, (Capt.) Woods Walker, Watkins, S. R. Keesler, W. B. McKinnon, C. H. McKinnon, J. T. Crayton. All but two of these return and should make someone work hard to beat them out.
