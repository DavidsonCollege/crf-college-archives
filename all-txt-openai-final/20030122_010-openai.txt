The Davidson men’s and women’s swimming and diving teams competed in full force against the College of Charleston last Saturday. Senior Diego Marquez’s traditional senior commemoration took place during the meet, a celebration which swimmers comically nicknamed “D-Day” due to the fact that Marquez is the sole senior on the team. His family, friends, and brothers of his fraternity, Sigma Phi Epsilon, were all in attendance, celebrating Marquez’s athletic and academic successes throughout his four years at Davidson.

The women’s team crushed the female Cougars, 181-59. The Davidson men’s team ran head to head with the Charleston Cougars and ended in a 119-107 defeat.

The women’s 200 medley relay team, consisting of Sarah Laws ’04, Megan Perez ’05, Jamie Sassanfar ’05, and Megan Hollar ’06, kicked off the meet with a first-place time of 1:52.17. Laws won in the 200 IM and 100 back, and Witt attained her victory in the 200 free and 100 fly. Witt’s time of 1:00.23 in the 100 fly moved her from holding the tenth fastest time in Davidson history to the fifth fastest time.

Junior Jenny Bruggers came in first place in the one-meter dive and second place in the three-meter dive. Junior captain Erin Rosintoski placed second in both the 200 free and 200 free, and sophomore Jenny Hoekstra nabbed a first-place finish in the 100 free and third place in the 50 free. Casey Grimes ’06 pushed herself above and beyond in the 1650 free; her second-place time of 18:32.11 in the 1650 free is now ranked as the tenth fastest time in school history.

The men’s team suffered from a slight loss but managed to attain points in all levels and with men from all grades. Sophomore diver Chris Wrobleski led the Wildcat men with a first-place finish in both the three-meter (197.25) and one-meter (237.75) dives. Brad Poole ’06 and Steve Tolson ’06 have been outstanding additions to the Davidson men’s team. Poole grabbed a win and a second-place finish. He touched first in the 100 free with a time of 0:49.30 and second in the 200 free. 

Juniors Sarah Laws and Vanesa Witt both achieved first-place finishes. Swimmers get off the blocks in recent action. The women’s team routed College of Charleston, while the men lost 119-107. Tolson placed second in both the 50 free (0:22.42) and the 100 free (0:49.48). Junior Robert Koch was a first-place winner in the 1650 free with a time of 17:21.20. The 200 medley relay team consisting of juniors Charlie Hunter, Michael Mazza, sophomore Foster Matthews, and Tolson grabbed a winning time of 1:39.45. Marquez celebrated his last home meet of his Davidson career in the 100 breast with a season-best of 1:04.15.

The Davidson swim team will compete again next weekend in a conference against Old Dominion, William and Mary, and UNC Wilmington. The competition will begin on Friday evening and continue on Saturday. The CAA Championships will take place in Fairfax, Va., from Feb 19 to 22. The team will also travel to Pittsburgh for the ECAC Championships Feb. 27 to March 1.

Davidson will induct four new members into Hall of Fame

On Feb. 15, four individuals will be honored for their special contributions to the college and its athletics programs. This quartet — Kathryn A. Beach-Verhey ’92, Douglas T. Cook ’70, James J. Kelly, III ’87, and Gerald F. Kroll ’70 — will be honored for those contributions as the newest class of Davidson’s Athletics Hall of Fame.

The Big South Conference Cross Country Runner of the Year in 1991, Kathy Beach was one of the most prolific female runners in Davidson history. Three times she was named the Wildcats’ team MVP in both cross country and track and field. Beach was the fastest Davidson runner in every cross country meet in which she ran.During her four years, save one, she set the school record in the 5K at the conference championships in 1991, a record which stood for four years. Summer Paris was All-Big South in cross country both years Davidson was a member of the conference. In the Wildcat record books, Beach still holds four individual indoor track records (1000 meters, mile, 3000 meters, and 5000 meters) and four individual outdoor track records (1500 meters, mile, 3000 meters, and 5000 meters), as well as two indoor relay records (4x800 and sprint medley). A four-year letter winner in cross country and track, Beach received the Goodwin-Exxon Award in 1990-91 and earned the Rebecca Stimson Award in 1992.

Doug Cook was one of several terrific players for Lefty Driesell and Terry Holland from 1967-70. During his three seasons, he scored 1,221 points, which currently places him 20th all-time at Davidson. He never averaged below 13.4 points a game in any of those three years, finishing his career at 14.6 points per game. He was an accurate shooter, hitting nearly 50 percent (49.6) of his field goal attempts. On the boards, the 6-6 center averaged 9.0 rebounds per contest. And when the pressure was on, Cook truly rose to the occasion. As a sophomore, he was named to the All-SoCon Tournament second team. But in each of the following two seasons, Cook earned SoCon Tournament MVP honors, with the Wildcats advancing to the NCAA Tournament all three of his seasons on the squad. He was also a first-team All-Southern Conference player his senior year when he averaged a double-double for the season (15.6 points, 10.2 rebounds).

Jim Kelly had a brilliant career as a goalkeeper for the Wildcats’ soccer teams from 1983 through 1987. He was a second-team All-American in 1987 when he helped the Wildcats to an 11-7-3 record and a 4-1 mark in the Southern Conference. He posted a school-record seven shutouts in 1987 and was named to the All-Southern Conference team for the third time. Although his statistics for saves are incomplete, Kelly still ranks third on the Davidson career list in that category with 242. He’s third in goals against average (1.36) and third in career shutouts with 14.

Jerry Kroll was another of the basketball stars from 1967-70, finishing his career with 1,165 points for 25th place all-time at Davidson. The 6-4 forward is still the most accurate free throw shooter in Wildcat history, having knocked down 83.5 percent (313 of 375) of his free throws. A spectacular outside shooter, Kroll connected on nearly 48 percent of his field goal attempts. Kroll’s best year came as a junior when he averaged 16.0 points a game and missed just 19 of his 138 free throws, plus was named to the All-Southern Conference first team. He was also named to the All-SoCon Tournament second team in 1968, and first team in ’69 and ’70. On the defensive end of the court, he was considered a terrific defender as well. And despite being listed as a forward, Kroll led the team in assists as a senior with 81.

A banquet will be held prior to the men’s basketball game against East Tennessee State on Feb. 15 at 7 p.m., during which the four honorees will be inducted. The quartet will also be recognized during the game in a halftime ceremony.
