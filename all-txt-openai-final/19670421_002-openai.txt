**Greek Week**

Davidson’s fraternities can be commended at least on a superficial level for the changes which have developed in the venerable old “Joe College” tradition of Greek Week. Human decency should not be a trait that has to be commended, but in the context of immaturity it seems that the transformation of what was “Hell Week” only a few years ago into the positive non-hazing Greek Week is a noticeable improvement. Civilization has still not occurred. Ask any pledge who has crawled through his house on hands and knees, counted railroad ties, or collected assorted panties and bras during the past week. At least positive superficialities have come about. At least now the emphasis is on coming to brotherhood by way of discussion of fraternity or college problems, or through service projects. (By the way, pledge, you had better get your fill of these while you can. Except for the annual alms-giving at Christmas and “building character through service” for next year’s pledges during Greek Week, this is probably the only time your fraternity as a whole will act for others. No, maybe that is not true. You never can tell when it will need to kowtow to the college to gain favor.)

The basic improvement needed is not in the conduct of Greek Week, but in the concept of that institution. Why is building pledge class unity such a big deal? Why is it so necessary to instill a reverence for the founders of the fraternity? Why is it necessary to build loyalty to the fraternity as something apart from the students of whom it is composed? Does the enjoyment of the company of close friends need to be reinforced by “mystic goodies”?

Fraternities are justifiable at Davidson for two reasons. One, people enjoy being in close association with some people more than with others. Secondly, fraternities are a convenient and, ideally, harmless way to meet the social needs of the students. It is easier to organize social activities through a fraternity than it is among another group of students who may be scattered all across the campus. Social functions organized on the basis of dormitory halls would be just as convenient, but they might not be as satisfying in any meaningful way. The two justifications for fraternities are interdependent.

The loyalty to a particular fraternity on the basis of its creed or written ideals is naive. Differences in moralistic tone can be perceived among the fraternities. However, the preservation of any such tone is entirely dependent upon the membership at a given time, not upon some symbolism everlastingly engraved upon the heart or branded on the rear with a paddle. The functions of Greek Week seem to be to introduce an artificial intensity into what could be quite natural relationships of concern among mature men and to instill loyalty to an institution which is falsely deemed to be the preserver of all that is right in the world. Greek Week itself then is no better than forced “love” or worshipping an institution or compulsory vespers.

**Overseer Wanted**

Three poets in one day should be quite a stimulating experience next week. With a little bit of luck and even fewer obligations, perhaps someone will be fortunate enough to hear and meet with the whole trio. On the other hand, the college might engage in some psychedelia by having all three stand in different corners of the Morrison Room in the College Union, turn on that mad overhead rotating light, and produce a paint-in.

The coming extravaganza points up the lack of coordination in scheduling or arranging to have such events. Theoretically, the Union is supposed to be watching the scheduling of events, but about all the Union can do in the matter at the present time is just make certain that two or more activities do not find themselves batting around in the same room at the same time.

Even more important than the scheduling problem (Wouldn’t it be nice to have so much going on that conflicts could not be avoided?), more important than allotment of rooms, is the need for some agency to be on the lookout for prominent men who might be scheduled to appear at Davidson and other places in the near area. Academic departments through the Piedmont University Center and the Social Council with its block-booking conferences are making use of this idea. Not only does it save them money, but it also means that they can attract more important figures.

A centralized office on campus to bring resources from outside the college would necessarily be sympathetic to requests from within the campus for certain events, as well as being able to draw upon regular correspondence with other schools.

**Cloak And Dagger Stuff**

Sub-committee reports for the Blue Sky Committee have been kicking their way around in the various mystic crannies of wherever somebody puts whatever it is. Everybody has heard the rumors that some dean at Princeton has said that the one thing holding Davidson back is the lack of a nocturnal subway between DC land and Queens. And most know of that one about how some small school out in the boondocks that is really setting the pace in education has said that the key to its success is the absence of a faculty and administration.

But of course the really exciting part of the whole deal is that the Blue Sky sub-committee on something or another has recommended that the whole student body be ferried to New York every other weekend to pick up the cultural offerings in metropolia which would complement the present ethnic beauties of Carolina. This does not even begin to consider the exciting proposal by the joint sub-sub-committee or something like that urging that compulsory ROTC be replaced by compulsory Peace Corps.

Then someday in the future, like next September, the whole set of proposals in an organic form will be opened for the students’ perusal. The natural tendency would be to have them read over the loudspeaker on top of Chambers Building. But perhaps each student should be given wallet-sized replicas of the great stones on which they will be written. But please note that they will be only written in chalk, not yet engraved.

The guidelines for the Blue Sky committee do state that they will be presented then for the consideration of interested students presumably so that alternatives could be proposed by them at least informally to committee members. Of course, the schedule does call for the entire proposed curriculum revision to be formally presented to the faculty at the first faculty meeting of next October. This means that any changes will have to be acted on within about a month if the powers that be are willing to consider changing THE PLAN to incorporate suggestions.

Even if there is confusion concerning the various ideas that may or may not be under consideration, few students would maintain in their sober moments that the Blue Sky Committee desires any less than what it considers to be the very best for the school. Nor does anyone really believe that the committee gets a kick out of being secretive just to enjoy playing a sort of divine mystery role.

The open meeting that was held on the proposal of the Sub-Committee on Non-Western Studies and on the concept of an Honors College supports this willingness to be frank on some things by the Blue Sky Committee. The hang-up comes in the fact that the committee is insisting on secrecy on most matters. Students on sub-committees are not bound to blood-signed oaths of secrecy on the information they have collected from other institutions. However, they are not supposed to reveal the proposals made by their groups.

An understanding of the complicated portions of the entire Blue Sky report is desirable for the students. It could on occasion facilitate faculty passage if solid student support were secured for the report. The secrecy with which sub-committee reports are being handled does seem to be inconsistent with the ideal of encouraging a more organic role for students within the college.

**Student Council Seeks ‘Energetic’ Image**

Renovation and assertion are the words that may unlock a new future for the Davidson Student Council and the whole position of student government on the Davidson campus. Acutely conscious of the complaints about the lackadaisical, “do-nothing” attitude of past Student Councils, the present council is trying to project a new, more energetic image to the student body.

“But let's begin at the beginning,” says Tom Earnhardt, leader of this new movement and the new president of the council. And so, presto! The old storage room on the second floor of the Union, previously known as the office of the Student Body President, will soon become the office of the Student Council, with a rug, a telephone, curtains, paintings, and regular office hours.

A committee of carefully selected students is already working on the revision of the outmoded Student-Body Constitution. Such a revision may allow the Student Council more working room and may change certain ancient elements of the constitution which have long needed revision.

Already the Student Council has begun to move into other new areas by sponsoring two projects initiated by Earnhardt, the Student Recruiting Program and the Educational Planning Program. Both projects are trying to spread information about Davidson to areas relatively unfamiliar with it and to arouse a previously untapped source of interest in Davidson College.

The Educational Planning Program is a service project in which college students can reveal their interests in college education to the public by helping guide high school students in their vocational choices for the future. Over the spring holidays a group of Davidson students traveled throughout Florida on such a mission, and this week groups are working in Columbus, Ga., the Richmond-Washington area, and the Nashville-Memphis area.

The Student Council is also planning to start sending delegates to various state and national conventions on a more regular basis. This year two delegates attended the State Student Legislature convention, and four attended the Administration Restricts.

**ED. NOTE:** This column, which will appear regularly, is written by students who will not return to Davidson next year, in order to allow them to express their opinions on the college.

By DAN MOMBREA

There are things happening on this campus. It’s impossible to ignore that fact. Not as quickly as they should maybe, and certainly with too many people still not caring, but they are happening. The student body, even if only in small groups, is taking matters in...their own hands and doing. The students on the Blue Sky Committee are talking about the lack of time and their fear that not enough will be changed. The newspaper staff wants to get on with the job of producing what was this year (for the first time in recent years) a real newspaper. The College Union can't wait until next year, neither can the students working for the Hungry I or the Union Coffee House. Even among the student body itself there is talk of "next year."

AMAZING YEAR

As far as this year goes, one can only be amazed at what happened. The Social Committee brought in, not just good entertainment, but really great entertainment. The students who form what might be considered "Davidson's art circle" held everything from their own shows of paintings to poetry readings to sing-ins. Students went to peace marches, walked in labor lines, started a truly significant civil rights organization, held forums on everything from subsidized athletics to alcohol on campus to the ideas behind being a conscientious objector. Chapel speakers at least once in a while deviated from the administration-spawned small-time Presbyterian minister and/or theologian syndrome that makes chapel such a delight. The president of the student body went on record as against the war in Vietnam. On another level, students finally broke down the one hundred-year-old color barrier that existed as a truly ugly spot in our fraternity system and for the student body itself. The only comment I can make on the latter accomplishment is to say that the day after the papers carried the story about the fraternity pledging a Negro was with one brother who was making a long-distance phone call. When he told the operator she would have to charge it to that house, the operator asked him if he belonged to that fraternity house. When he said yes, she replied with "Y'all did real good," then went on to make the call.

STRUGGLE

The most interesting opinions I’ve heard this year about the continuing struggle in all ways between a student body that is positively trying and an administration that exists to negate were made by a member of the administration, another student, and a member of the faculty. The student said (admittedly a little carried away) "Their time has come"; the member of the administration said "They are really getting defensive, almost paranoid, about the changes that are taking place"; and the member of the faculty said "They (referring to the administration) know that the only way some things are going to change is for a real turnover in personnel to occur, and they have a very real fear that they will be among those missing when the axe stops falling."

But if the students who have read this and felt good about the accomplishments I've cited, and if those who are glad that things "are finally changing" would realize that every student counts, that they could help if only by letting their leaders in student government and on the Blue Sky Committee know they are behind them, then more could and would be done. This student body has more raw talent than any other student body I've been acquainted with. This isn’t my opinion, it’s the opinion of people who know education and know college campuses. Davidson College deserves its reputation. But its reputation has been earned not "because of," but "despite" an educationally-detrimental administrative desire to preserve the status quo. It is the student body that has built Davidson up, just as it will be the student body that will change this school to the truly great small college it is.

ALL KINDS

It will take all kinds of men to implement the changes that will be recommended or championed in the next few years. That an atmosphere conducive to change be fostered is one of the most important of these. The only way for this to happen is for more students to make their opinion known in some way. If you want to see Davidson become a better school, then in some way begin to step out. Write to THE DAVIDSONIAN, go to the Blue Sky Committee, talk to leaders in student government. If each of us in some way makes his opinion known, he will first of all give our student leaders some basis for valid representation of the student body, and secondly let the administration know that this student body is behind the members of the faculty and the students who are honestly interested in making Davidson not just an above-average institution, but a truly great one, and are not afraid to change it, or with it, to accomplish that goal.

Model United Nations Assembly. At least this many and probably more will return to these meetings next year, and one or two delegates will probably attend the National Student Association convention this summer, although Davidson is no longer a member of this organization. Behind sending such delegations is the hope that they can pick up new ideas about student government by talking with people from other schools. One of the brightest hopes for the immediate future is a revived Student Exchange Program, by which several students could visit schools similar to Davidson and examine firsthand the rules and inner workings of those schools. In turn, Davidson would entertain students from these schools and let them examine the way things are conducted at Davidson. In order to sponsor these and several other new programs, the Student Council is hoping to get a raise in its budget, which is now less than $1,000.

For the first time in its history, the Student Council is meeting twice a week. Although this is intended to last only until the end of the year, it may continue next year if the issues are still numerous and the interest is still present. The new Student Council has already approved two budding organizations, the new Campus Club and the Residence Hall Association. Bud Cousar has also assimilated the proposals of various platforms and made a list of topics with which the Student Council must deal in the coming year. Among these well-discussed topics are exams before Christmas; abolition of Saturday classes; abolition of compulsory ROTC; an annual student-organized, student-run lecture-concert series; a new bookstore, expanded and subsidized; abolition of the present drinking rule; elimination of the cut system; and other old favorites. According to a new policy, the council meetings will be open this year to any interested students. Earnhardt or some council member will be in the Student Council office every afternoon to discuss problems or issues with any students.

Looking Backward

HUAC Strikes (Out) Again

Ted Winter, co-editor of The Miscellany, received a press release the other day from one of Congress’ more humorous institutions, the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC). This is the committee, you might recall, which last summer sponsored a hippie-land circus, ringmastered by Rep. Joe Pool (D-Tex.), the Joe Pyne of American politics. The release is an expose of the "communist origin and manipulation" of last Saturday’s peace demonstrations in New York and San Francisco. I suppose it all depends upon one’s definition of the words "origin" and "manipulation" whether one accepts the accuracy of the committee’s statements.

It is as easy for someone in the academic community to attack HUAC as it is for a Congressman to attack the evil communist conspiracy, but my intent is not to present the constitutional and political arguments against the committee’s existence. The committee is probably factually correct in associating the recent marches with people like Herbert and Bettina Aptheker, although there is nothing in the release to warrant the statement that "communists are the principal (my emphasis) organizing force" behind these demonstrations. Also, the marches were boycotted by many Americans opposed to the Vietnam War, on the grounds that communist as well as American responsibility for the slaughter would not be made clear. However, this only serves to point up how widespread the anti-war feeling is in the United States, since huge crowds participated despite the boycott.

Rather than attacking the committee per se, I hope to indicate some of the deficiencies of the press release. In the first place, the fact that the address on the envelope (not to the editor of the literary magazine, but to the editor of the defunct humor magazine) should seem so appropriate for a HUAC release indicates how difficult it is for anyone to the left of James Kilpatrick to take seriously most of what the committee says. Even if the committee is accurate, its credibility gap, at least as wide as the White House's, obstructs belief. Secondly, there is a question of relevance. Upwards of 200,000 people (by police estimate) engaged in peace marches last Saturday. Blaming this on communist organization and manipulation is akin to blaming the Nashville riots on Stokely Carmichael. Perhaps members of this country’s tiny Communist Party had a hand in organizing the demonstrations, but 200,000 people don't show up to march, and people in the ghetto don’t riot, unless there are deeper motivations, such as those provided by American policy in Southeast Asia since the mid-fifties, or by American history since 1619.

Actually, the release implicitly accepts the irrelevance of demonstrating communist presence at the marches. In the conclusion of the release, the committee predicts the horrendous effects growing out of the events of last Saturday. These will occur, not because of communist participation, but because of the "global publicity" given the marches by "communist propagandists." (One wonders if such publicity agencies as Time, Newsweek, the Associated Press, and United Press International fall under the rubric of "communist propagandists," after all, these agencies certainly gave worldwide publicity to the demonstrations.)

In any case, such demonstrations will, because of publicity, "give aid and comfort to communists everywhere," "create the false impression that a truly large segment of the US population is vehemently opposed to this country's policy in Vietnam," and create difficulties for the United States "in convincing our allies of the correctness of this country's policy in Vietnam." Thus, the committee implicitly assumes that there is not a sizeable portion of the American populace opposed to our Vietnam policy, and that our "allies" are not convinced of the correctness of this policy. The first assumption would seem to indicate either that those millions residing in the United States who are opposed to America’s Vietnam policy are not to be considered part of the "US population," or that the committee is engaging in wishful thinking. The second assumption would seem to imply the correctness of the committee’s belief that the American policy is questionable. One wonders whether "our allies" who are questioning our Vietnam policy include the people of South Vietnam.
