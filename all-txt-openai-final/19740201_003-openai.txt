### The Davidsonian § February 1, 1974

#### Three Fuller Heralds Modern Renaissance
By GORDON WIDENHOUSE

R. Buckminster Fuller will be on the Davidson campus this Monday and Tuesday as one of the year’s Reynolds’ guest lecturers. His appearances may be one of the biggest opportunities of the year for the average Davidsonian. Director of the College Union C. Shaw Smith went even farther than this, saying that "this is the chance of a lifetime."

Truly, the multi-faceted man who has been a part of every field of study one can possibly think of should offer a chance to broaden the average horizon for anyone. Being a man of many fields and ideas, his talks do not typically deal with any one subject. He will generally range over many areas in his delivery, bombarding his audience with so many ideas that he often exhausts them. Fuller will present his ideas of how man can help himself and what the world could really be like if people set their minds to the tasks of making it what they wanted it to be.

Although most popularly known for the invention of the geodesic dome, and earlier for the Dymaxion House, which has been referred to as a "metallurgical cheesecake," Fuller is considered to be best known for the contribution of the philosophical and mathematical system which the dome expresses: synergetics. This is more or less the idea of utilizing the least possible space for the greatest amount of material necessary.

The Dymaxion House was his first invention, built in 1928. Weighing three tons, selling at 25 cents per pound, fabricated in factories, deliverable in two hours, installed and serviced with the ease of a telephone, it would have been as easily in reach of the individual with an average salary as the Model A.

Fuller’s system is also ethical, calling man to bring his attitudes, strategies, and ethics into alignment with the universal laws of nature before he destroys himself. As might be expected from this viewpoint, Fuller has many followers under the age of 30. He feels that we are just at another point in the evolutionary process of history. One of his ideas that could be of profound significance for the world is his theory of recycling pollutants so they can be put to use to save energy, which will at the same time help to solve the pollution problem that the world faces.

Speaking of energy and the present crisis, Fuller was 50 years ahead of his time in predicting the energy situation that the world faces now. He also foresaw the revolutions in communications and technology. Some of the many concrete things he has done include constructing modular housing and designing new kinds of buildings and cities for the jet age, securing more than 20 patents for his remarkable ideas. One of the more interesting patents he received was for the Airocean map of the world, which is the only flat projection of the world’s geography that does not distort the land masses.

In keeping with his phenomenal reputation, Fuller travels over 200,000 miles per year. He says that man was born to be a success; as much a success as the hydrogen atom. Man, he feels, has distorted his technical advantages with inadequate attitudes. For the first time and maybe the last, man may have a chance to bring his attitudes into alignment and actually build Kepler’s "cosmic harmonies" on earth.

Fuller has his own "World Game." It is designed to demonstrate the opposite strategies of war games, how one can do more with less, can design a world where no one loses, where resources can be multiplied through use, caring, and sharing, and where success can be global.

Fuller, who is now 78 years old, attended Harvard for two years but never graduated. But more than 30 colleges and universities have awarded him honorary degrees. He has also lectured at institutions all over the world. One of the unique inventions Fuller has come up with is his floating city, which would relieve a space problem resulting from an overpopulated planet. This concept is being looked into by the Japanese at the present.time. Indira Gandhi said of Fuller, “He is a pathfinder in his obsession with the architecture of the universe. His innovations follow from his endeavor to understand what science and man can do to each other.” Probably the best way to describe Fuller would be to call him Renaissance Man of the Twenty-First Century. He is an astounding intellectual, scientist, engineer, ecologist, philosopher, poet, astronomer, and more. His lectures will be at 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. on both Monday and Tuesday. The morning lectures will be in Perkins Auditorium with his evening engagements set for Love Auditorium. This may indeed be one of the greatest opportunities that a Davidson student will have during his undergraduate education here. It is one lecture series that no one should miss. Magazine articles which can serve as a very useful background for Fuller's talks are at the reference desk in the library. His books include “Nine Chains to the Moon,” “No More Second Hand God,” “Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth,” “Utopia or Oblivion,” and two books of poetry. Some of these may be purchased in the Student Book Store.

Senate Passes Drop-Add, Grade Plans
By STEVE BELL
News Editor

In two separate votes, the SGA Senate has reaffirmed its earlier endorsement of the reforms in Davidson’s grading policies proposed by Steve Canterbury’s ad hoc committee on grades. The votes came in response to a report from the faculty’s Educational Policy Committee, which is now considering the proposals. In other business at its meeting Tuesday night, the Senate heard a general report on the college’s campus security.

Canterbury’s reforms, if ratified by the faculty, would extend the period in which Davidson students are free to drop courses to five weeks. Under current policies, a student who withdraws from one of his courses after the first week of the term receives a failing grade for the subject. Canterbury has also proposed that failing grades be removable from the computations of student grade-point-averages. Last fall, both of his proposals were endorsed by the Senate and sent on to the EPC, where they are now under consideration. The approval of the EPC is needed before the proposals can reach the general faculty for final decision.

In his report from the EPC, Andy Lamas expressed the possibility that the faculty would reject the 5-week drop period and opt instead for a 2-week period, or no change at all. The Senate unanimously passed a resolution reaffirming its support of Canterbury’s position, but at the same time requesting that Lamas, one of two student representatives meeting with the EPC, seek approval of the 2-week period should Canterbury’s proposal meet rejection. Lamas also reported difficulties with the proposal to make “F” grades replaceable. Duncan Moore suggested that the Senate extend its original endorsement, and recommend that all grades be made replaceable. Discussion ensued on the question of which endorsement would be more likely to achieve change of some sort, and Senator Moore’s motion failed 12-4.

In other business, Director of the Physical Plant Grover C. Meetze Jr., Lt. Hughes, and members of the Davidson police department reported on the campus security system. According to their report, all campus police activities are coordinated by Hughes. The campus security force consists of three full-time and two weekend campus policemen. These officers are all members of the town’s police department, but they report directly to Meetze, the college administrator in charge of security. With respect to their attitudes concerning possible violations of some laws by the students themselves, Hughes commented, “The campus is your home. We don’t want to arrest you in your own home. We're here to protect your property, your lives.” Of much more concern to the police is theft. Hughes acknowledged that there was more theft in the first few weeks of school than during all of last year. Hughes asked that students register their bicycles, report all strangers, especially in the dormitories, and immediately report any crimes. Moreover, he added, “I know it’s the honor code, but students still need to lock their doors.”
