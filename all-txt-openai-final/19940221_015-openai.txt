Women's B-ball suffers sixth loss
By Matt Pitzer

The women’s basketball team lost its sixth consecutive game Saturday night, 74-60, to Tennessee-Chattanooga, leaving Davidson just three regular season games to pick up a conference win, one of its preseason goals. Saturday, the Wildcats were down by just six points at the half, but the Moccasins (12-11, 6-5 Southern Conference) pulled away after the break. Carolyn Kirsch continued to play well for the ‘Cats (5-17, 0-5), scoring 13 points and grabbing 17 rebounds, the most by any Davidson player this season. Tonya Sharpe hit five of seven three-pointers on her way to throwing in 17 points.

On Thursday in Belk Arena, Georgia Southern dropped the Wildcats, 87-61. The Eagles currently lead the conference with a 9-1 record. In that game, Sharpe again had 17 points, while Erin Butcher added 12 and Kristen Ferrucci 10. One of coach John Filar’s few goals for the season was to pick up a conference win for the team in its second year of existence. The Cats have only three games left to do so, two of those on the road.

The two freshmen point guards, Monica Winter and Elizabeth DuBose, have been playing well. Against Georgia Southern, the pair only turned the ball over three times, improving on one of Filar’s concerns about the team. Davidson cut the Eagles’ lead to five points with 13 minutes remaining in the game Thursday. But Georgia Southern ran away with the game with a 34-13 run to close out the game.

The first attempt at that one win, and the team’s final home game, will come Wednesday at home against Appalachian State, one of the tougher teams in the league. The Mountaineers topped the Cats handily last month in Boone.

B-ball falls to fourth in Southern Conference

The Wildcats made more field goals and got more rebounds, but the Mountaineers made the right kind of shots, dropping ten three-pointers that proved too much. In the first half, Brandon Williams showed everyone why he is called “O-Zone,” electrifying the Davidson crowd with two powerful dunks, one on an alley-oop and another on a breakaway. At the end of the half, an App. St. guard nailed a 25-footer at the buzzer to give the Mountaineers a 49-48 lead.

The second half included several lead changes that put the crowd through an emotional roller coaster. Janko Narat led the Cats with 23 points, moving him into the eighth position on the all-time scoring list. With 13 seconds remaining and down by three, Davidson had the ball with a chance to tie the game. The Cats got the ball to the man they wanted, setting Narat at the top of the key. He missed the shot, but the rebound fell to Williams, who got the ball back to Narat once more, but the shot missed, and Davidson’s winning streak came to a close.

Freshman Mark Donnelly had his best game of the year, coming through big for the Wildcats, hitting all four of his shots, including three three-pointers for 11 points. The Cats got few breaks from the refs, as the Mountaineers were whistled for only 14 fouls. At one point in the second half, Davidson had 9 fouls to Appalachian’s 1. The next home game will be tonight, February 21 at 7:00 p.m.

Swimming & diving finish season strongly
By Matt Pitzer

The team finished fourth and fifth, respectively, in the 400 Freestyle Relay. “As a senior, I thought it was a darn good season,” said one of the team members.Good way to go out and a good start for a young team next year... all the seniors were glad to be a part of it,” said senior Dave Martin. Added freshman Bo Craig, “We got to compete against schools of our own size, which really helped us along.” In the final polls, the Davidson women finished fifth place with a total of 307.5 points; the men, with 319.0 points, finished sixth. Martin echoed the team's attitude: “It’s just the beginning for next year.” Davidson Swimming and Diving clearly finished their season with a very strong effort, one that foretells an even better season in 1994-95.

Tough track competition challenges thinclads v. ETSU

Nguyen passed the baton to Lara Burkholder who sprinted to a 63.1 in the 400m leg. Jean DeMoss took the baton from Burkholder and ran the 1200m leg (4:03). Sophomore Marie Grisez brought the relay home with a quick mile (5:29). The final time of 13:03 was fifty-three seconds faster than the school record at the beginning of the season and thirty seconds faster than the previous week. Competition started again on Saturday morning and Maria Whitehead jumped 33’6” in the triple jump. In the 5000m, freshman Stephanie Moses continued to improve her time running 19:10 and finishing tenth overall. The last event of the day was the 4x400 relay. Running with three freshmen and a junior, the relay team shaved seconds off the existing record to better the mark to 4:19. Lara Burkholder ran the first position (63.1) and handed off to Maria Whitehead (63.9). “Fresh legs” Sallie Permar ran the third leg (65.7) and handed off to Mary Baxter (66.7). Ending the indoor season with several broken records and many personal bests is only an indication of what the outdoor season holds for the track team.
