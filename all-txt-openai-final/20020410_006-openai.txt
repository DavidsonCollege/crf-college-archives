On a recent Saturday night, a nine-year-old blond-haired, blue-eyed girl dressed for an evening out with her mother. After brushing
her hair, she drew a red dot on her forehead. She turned to her mother and declared herself beautiful.

The mother, a friend of mine, and her daughter had spent part of that Saturday afternoon watching *The Little Red
Dot*, a movie co-sponsored by the Dean Rusk Program and the Davidson International Association. The movie examined a classroom of
Canadian children’s reactions to a new student in their classroom, a student who had recently immigrated from Sri Lanka. The
students’ (and their parents’) reactions to the Sri Lankan girl, as well as to her bindhi (the red dot on
her forehead, which, as the students learned, is worn by girls and women as an adornment), ranged from indifference to
curiosity to racism. The movie was part of Multicultural Kids Day, an event sponsored by DIA that engaged 150 local
children in a day of international celebration.

**Planet gross: restaurant review**

By Gavin WEBER Arts and Living Editor

As you are traveling up or down I-77, you might want to take Exit 25, where you could find lumber,
paint, fast food, hotels, and other self-satisfying wants. But if you take a right off the exit heading south, and
a left heading north, you will come to Birkdale Village, which will be located on your right. There lies a
building complex that tries to create a new age Floridian village. Within the village, there are many attractions such as
the movie theater, Starbucks, Dick’s Sports, GAP, and a restaurant called Planet Grill.

Planet Grill is a restaurant that makes a poor attempt at being a trendy new age eating place. As you
enter the restaurant, you are absorbed into a darkened red and blue atmosphere with unfinished concrete and steel pipe railings,
which makes a fair attempt at its purpose. However, the televisions that broadcast sports detract from Planet Grill’s “trendiness.” Because
of the entrance’s location, you must wait behind a wall: who knows what kind of creature will come and lead
you to your table! Luckily - or maybe unluckily - it’s just an average hostess in a gaudy, tropically-themed shirt.
If you can keep your mind off that hideous creation that they call a shirt, your hostess then teaches you
how to eat at Planet Grill. The lesson is helpful, but I’m still not quite sure how the process works.
It involves colored Popsicle sticks, permanent markers, and your name. For some, that may be appealing, but for most, it
is not wanted in a new age trendy restaurant.

After the clearing up of names with your server, you are then led to the food bar, where the fun
may begin in creating your own food combination. The food bar houses vegetables, meats, and sauces from which you can
pick and choose, mix and match. The vegetables are not extraordinary for creating original combinations; the meats are typical and
unappetizing. They’re not much different from the options at Commons. The sauces, though, provide many possibilities for adding that spicy
flavor to your meal. Once your bowl is filled with your chosen food items, you put your name stick in
the bowl and place it at the cooking counter.

**DIA provides activities for community, college**

During the week of March 19 alone, DIA has done much to help internationalize the Davidson experience. Multicultural Kids Day
was followed by a dance workshop Sunday night, where people learned Salsa and the Cha-Cha (another event co-sponsored by Dean
Rusk), which they then practiced the following Saturday during a night of clubbing.Bing in Charlotte at Salamander. Tuesday night featured
DIA’s Coffee Night at the Outpost, followed Wednesday by a benefit concert with folk singer David Roth, an event co-sponsored
by Interfaith and the Business into Charlotte Friday night for a Cuban feast at La Gran Havana. (Side note: For
all you students complaining about doing the same thing weekend after weekend and for all you students wondering what to
do on a date should you ever muster up the courage to ask somebody on a date; DIA’s activities could
be your answer!) Thank you, DIA, for broadening our perceptions of beauty, politics, fun, and culture.

Bray-Merrell is the Associate Dean of Students.

From there, you make your way back to your table to wait for your exciting food creation. If you are
a salad eater, there is a salad bar, but it’s less extensive than the one at Commons, and the most
exciting item is a carafe of Bacos. After munching on your “salad,” you are then brought your creation with white
rice and tortillas. Your food is now nice and hot, and also is soaking in a pool of sauce, where
one with high blood pressure would never want to take a swim. After one plate, you are welcome to go
back and work on your creativity for as long as you like, but there is an additional charge for bringing
home a doggie bag.

Despite its popularity, my dining partners and I thoroughly loathed our experience at Planet Grill. Service, food, and atmosphere were
all subpar, even for an establishment like “the Grill.” Also, the bill was unreasonably high. I cannot recommend Planet Grill.
If you enjoy overpriced, low-quality, ultra-salty food, go ahead and knock yourself out. But unless you’re breaking a five-day fast
or have an insatiable case of the munchies, keep away from Birkdale’s Planet Grill.

...and also had the opportunity to work extensively with the world-renowned Royal Shakespeare Company during that company’s recent residency at
Davidson College.

Love’s Labour’s Lost is one of Shakespeare’s least performed plays. The plot concerns some young men intent on “study,” who
swear off women, and limit themselves to one meal a day and only three hours of sleep a night. Comic
situations overwhelm them as they struggle to keep their oaths—especially when some beautiful French women arrive! The play will appeal
to those who like to laugh heartily, like to think deeply, and those who enjoy a battle of the sexes.
It is appropriate for all ages, and will include audience interaction. For more information, please contact Cynthia Lewis at 704-894-2257
or cylewis@davidson.edu, or visit www.performingshakespeare.com.

A Davidson College English class has spent the semester working as Shakespearean actors, putting together a production of Love’s Labour’s
Lost from the ground up. They’ve created and built the set, worked on interpretation of the text, found the right
costumes, and even sold tickets. Now it’s show time! The public is invited to attend one of the five performances
of this model Elizabethan theatre production Friday, April 19, through Tuesday, April 23, in the college’s Duke Family Performance Hall.
Shows begin at 7:30 p.m. April 19-22. The April 23 performance, which is being staged on Shakespeare’s birthday, begins at
10 p.m. Admission is $4, and tickets are available at the door. The sixteen students staging the production are led
by Dana Professor Cynthia Lewis.
