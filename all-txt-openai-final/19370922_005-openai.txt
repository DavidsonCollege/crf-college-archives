Chubby King’s Orchestra Finishes Third Summer Season

Chubby King and his swing orchestra climaxed their third successful season this summer and will swing into the fourth season
at an early date. The orchestra opened this summer on June 10 at Mayview Manor in Boone, N.C., and furnished
the musical moments for that resort until August 22. Every evening, dinner music was played and twice each week the
band played for dances.

The orchestra this summer was composed of twelve pieces, and seven members of the band were from Davidson: Harry Lee
Clark, Paul McGarity, Jimmy McDonald, Dick Wright, Walter Heilman, Billy Crooks, and Maestro King. Chubby and his boys will open
at the Davidson Hotel on next Monday and will play there during the winter months. For the past few years,
the orchestra has played there while school was in session. Chubby announces that during their stay at Mayview Manor, the
band received several attractive offers to play elsewhere. The Pavilion at Myrtle Beach and the Embassy Club in Miami both
made efforts to secure the orchestra, but a contract held the boys at the Manor until the end of the
summer.

Before and after their engagement at Boone, King played for several dances in Charlotte, Lincolnton, and adjoining towns. Plans for
the next summer's engagement are already in progress; the band will probably make a tour to Europe or play at
the Hotel.

TO HEAD BATTALION

Boggs Replaces McClure; Assumes Y.M.C.A. Duties

Filling the position left vacant last year by Albert McClure, Wade H. Boggs assumed at the beginning of this semester
the duties of Y.M.C.A. Secretary at Davidson. Wade graduated last June in the centennial class, leaving behind him a brilliant
record. He attained the unusual distinction of earning both Phi Beta Kappa and Omicron Delta Kappa keys and was president
of the 100th class to graduate from Davidson College.

After spending most of the summer in Montreat, where he was in charge of boys’ work, Wade plunged into the
midst of his duties here when he collaborated with Dr. P. H. Gwynn in conducting the orientation period for freshmen
held at the beginning of the year. Having acquitted himself exceptionally well in that capacity, he has settled down to
the job of fulfilling the program of the Y for the 1937-1938 session.

Albert McClure, Y.M.C.A. Secretary last year, left the post now held by Boggs to fill the pulpit of the First
Presbyterian Church of Lincolnton, N.C.

Centennial Class President Is Named as New Y.M.C.A. Secretary

Adding to a long list of honors, M. L. “Teeny” Lafferty will head the R.O.T.C. battalion during the 1937-38 school
year. According to Colonel Rhett who released the appointments, “Lafferty is the only man for the job.” Lafferty’s official rank
is cadet major.

RECEIVES MIAMI OFFER

Band to Play at Davidson Hotel

Chubby King and his boys will open at the Davidson Hotel on next Monday and will play there during the
winter months. For the past few years, the orchestra has played there while school was in session. Chubby announces that
during their stay at Mayview Manor, the band received several attractive offers to play elsewhere. The Pavilion at Myrtle Beach
and the Embassy Club in Miami both made efforts to secure the orchestra, but a contract held the boys at

DAVIDSON ARCH TO STAND ON CAMPUS AS MEMORIAL

Arch to Be Moved From Guilford Battleground to College Campus

The Davidson Arch, one of two which were erected on July 4, 1906, is obtaining a memorial to General William
Lee Davidson, a great patriot. The college is in the process of moving the arch from the Guilford Battleground to
the college campus. In obtaining and re-erecting this monument, the college is honoring General Davidson. The Alumni Association agreed to
rebuild it on the campus.

RICHARDSON OFFERS AID

We are pleased to announce that plans for the next summer's engagement are already in progress; the band will probably
make a tour to Europe or play at the Hotel.

What! With those holes in your pants?

No, with the girl next door!

Students Hear Dr. Moffett In First Vespers

Three types of men were described by Dr. H. M. Moffett in the opening sermon of the Sunday vesper series
last Sunday night. Dr. Moffett, pastor of the Davidson Presbyterian Church, used parallel passages, Philemon 1:24 and II Timothy 4:10-11,
in pointing out the qualities of Demus, Mark, and Luke.

Dr. Moffett said that every man has the outstanding characteristics of one of these three. The weak-heartedness of Mark, and
his ultimate repentance and forgiveness were next considered. Dr. Moffett declared that a man can always come back through the
help of God; as with Mark, failure is often used as a strengthening clause to enable a man to make
a strong finish. But the most admirable personality was that of Luke. He remained steadfast as an associate of Paul’s
in his Christian ministry.
