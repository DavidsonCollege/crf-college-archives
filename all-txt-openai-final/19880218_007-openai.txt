**Greetings With A Smile, or Lots of Booze**

**A Guide to The "BRICK" Party Life**

by Jay Barron and Kevin Dugan

1. The GREETER Stares Into Your Eyes But Does Not Say Anything.

TRANSLATION: The Greeter is either your frat brother or he wants to be.

2. They Clap You on the Back and Smile.

TRANSLATION: He thinks you're gay or just likes you.

3. They Deck Behind the Nearest Burgeoning.

TRANSLATION: He forgot your name.

4. They Greet You with a Short Wave, But Don't Use Your Name.

TRANSLATION: They would rather be dead than seen talking to you.

5. They Are By Recognizing You.

TRANSLATION: That is the guy who puked on your shoes at the party last night.
