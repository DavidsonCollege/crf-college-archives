Scott, Swansbrough, Brew bring out the best at home track meet

Despite the rising temperatures, the blue sky and great fans contributed to making Saturday’s fourth annual Irwin Belk Invitational a
success. The athletes did the rest.

For the men, Greg Scott ’04 doubled in the 800m and 1500m and showed home fans why he’s making quite
the raucous this year. While both times were personal bests, his 1500m time of 3:56.11 was nearly 13 seconds quicker
than teammate Nick Lehman’s second-place performance of 4:09.03, and his 1:55.39 in the 800m nabbed him first as well.

“In the 800m, the [other competitor] made his move on the first turn [of the second lap],” said Scott, “but
I just sat on his shoulder and decided to make my move when I came around the turn, like I
always do.” He continued, “Coming down the home stretch, I could hear everyone yelling. It was an awesome feeling.”

Ben Gaspar ’04 and co-captain Jimmy Swansbrough ’03 also impressed. Gaspar set the pace in the 3000m run, pounding in
lap at a time, but just fell short of the victory when Rocky Bilotta from Lees-McRae passed him on the
final lap. His 8:45.65 fell just short of a personal best.

Swansbrough, sporting a new “Mr. T”-style Mohawk, competed in the first steeplechase ever at Davidson’s home meet, whipping out another
gutsy performance. Fans standing on the balcony outside of the Union took special joy in watching as each runner leapt
over the water-jump hurdle and into the water, cheering with enthusiasm each time. Taking the race from the start, Swansbrough
powered over the water jump more so than any other athlete and crossed the line in 9:42.59, 20 seconds faster
than second place. Feeling the effects of one of the toughest events on a hot spring day, he collapsed on
the track afterwards. He would later be OK.

“It was fun to get a chance to race in front of the home crowd,” said Swansbrough. “Any time you
get to run the inaugural [steeplechase] race at your own school, it’s pretty sweet — especially when you win it.”

From the sprints and field events, Andrew Pratt ’04 and Thomas Headen ’04 finished tied for sixth in the 100m
dash and fifth in the long jump, respectively. On a special side note, Lee Wheless ’05 raced for the first
time in over 13 months as he recovered from various knee ailments and surgery. His 1500m time was good enough
for ninth place.

Coach Gary Andrews was particularly proud of how the meet ran. “I can never say enough about how these guys
perform. They just went out and hauled it in today, as usual,” he commented. “It’s also really special—especially for the
seniors—to let the guys perform in front of their peers. I’m glad we can give them this opportunity,” he said.

On the women’s side, Anna Brew ’05 failed to disappoint again. Opening the day off with the 5k run, she
opened up conservatively but quickly left the pack behind, speeding up as the race went on, en route to an
18:29.42 first-place finish, nearly a minute and a half faster than second.

Performing as double trouble, Allie Martin ’06 and Liz Gross ’03 each pulled out good races in the 800m and
1500m races. Martin got the best of Gross this time.Time, though, just edging her in the 1500m with a time
of 4:51.60 in addition to her 2:23.35 800m time. “It’s good racing each other because it really pushes us both.
We’re used to training with each other, so when we get to the race, we can really work together,” said
Martin.

Carolyn Mohr ’06 was the only other women’s Wildcat besides Brew to haul in the gold. Her 11:14.09 in the
3k was a personal best as she put her nearest competitor behind her by over 25 seconds. The first women’s
athletes to perform the steeple at home were Kate Wilson ’04 and Carissa Skrivanek ’06. Skrivanek’s first ever steeple experience
was a positive one, as she crossed the line fourth in 13:01.52. Wilson finished in 13:26.06.

Leading the sprinters was Clarissa Carr ’05, who finished seventh in the open quarter in 62.23. In the field, Kim
Pierre ’05 earned fourth in the discus and sixth in the shot with tosses of 35.49m and 10.21m, respectively.

Said Brew on the meet, “It was a lot of fun to have a home meet with our fans there.
Hopefully, we can take the momentum into next week’s meet, [the Furman Invitational.]”

“Well, I care for a thin year bean to become a cross-country runner.” With the additional mileage base he put
in over the summer, Scott has been able to not only slice down his cross time from 27:15 to 26:21
but also to add solid 1500m times to his arsenal. “He’s got some natural speed, so when he increased his
base a bit, it allowed him to run the endurance events that much better,” said Andrew.

As a freshman, his 1500m time was 4:17, not even in the same league as his new personal best of
3:56.11, which just occurred Saturday at Davidson’s very own invitational. Coach Andrew credits Scott’s success to his excellent sense of
planning. “He sets goals and sticks to them,” commented Andrew. “Certainly he’s come a long way. That double he pulled
out on Saturday [of his 1500m and 1:55.39 800m]; he just couldn’t have done as a freshman.”

Scott's goals for this season, in fact, need some revising. “My 1500m goal needs a little reevaluation, considering I’ve broken
it already,” said Scott with a chuckle. “I’d like to bring it down a few seconds to come for a
conference spot.” “As for the 800m, Dan Gibson’s record of 1:52.81 would be a nice one to grab, and I’m
getting pretty close,” said Scott, who already holds the indoor 800m record in addition to being let.
