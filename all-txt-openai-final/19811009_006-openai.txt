**Y Drive**

**Student service corps begins fall push**

by Anne Goodwin ’84

Many Davidson students who hear the name Y Student Service Corps have a vague idea of a group of nice
folks who do good things for other people. Now that the Y Corps Fall Fund Drive is starting, however, these
students’ curiosity about the group’s purpose has been piqued.

The Y Corps has ten divisions, known as blocks, which handle different service functions. Y Corps President John Spangler said
the organization is “decentralized and we like it that way.” Each block has its own head to be in charge
of its particular function. Students may serve on any block which interests them.

The blocks are:

1) Senior Citizens — pairs up students and Davidson senior citizens in order that they may visit and share experiences
or talents.

2) Day Care Center — arranges for student volunteers to help teachers at the local day care center.

3) STEP — will start in January to arrange for students to help tutor children at the Davidson Elementary School.

4) Current Events — meets each Wednesday evening in the 900 Room for a discussion which is open to everyone.

5) Prisons — takes a group to the Huntersville Minimum Security Prison each Friday afternoon at 2 to visit with
prisoners, play basketball and other games, and tutor.

6) Community Center — offers courses on subjects ranging from crafts to dancing to furniture upholstery and provides an after-school
program for Davidson youngsters.

7) Depot Lunch — serves sandwiches, ice cream, and cookies each Thursday from noon to 1:30 for students, faculty, and
other community members.

8) CROP — serves beans and cornbread each Tuesday from noon to 1:30 for a mere $1.00, which goes to
the CROP World Hunger Fund.

9) Environmental — collects paper and aluminum for recycling, and winterizes houses in Davidson. Last year, they built a solar
greenhouse onto the Depot as well.

10) Awareness — distributes notices, makes posters, and is generally in charge of communications.

Y Corps secretary Kim McAllister said “people can get involved in these blocks any time during the year.” There are
“opportunities for regular and irregular service,” she added.

In addition to your manpower, the Y Corps needs your money. The Fall Fund Drive, which starts today, provides the
operational budget for the entire year. “We are thinking that $5.00 per person that we contact is not an unreasonable
demand,” John said. The only money from the fund drive which goes outside the Davidson community is sent to Davidson
alumni working as teachers in Kenya.

“We feel that through the Y we offer an opportunity for service that will not be equaled... [and that] will
not be as available later in life,” Community Liaison Gordon Turnbull said. “We hope that [students] will get into the
habit of service.”

Meetings of the Y Student Service Corps are every other Monday at 10 pm. The next one will be October
12.
