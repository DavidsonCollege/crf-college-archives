THE DAVIDSONIAN

SPORTS

Women's track & field runs strong

By Jean DeMoss

This past weekend over 80 track teams and clubs journeyed to Durham for the Duke Invitational track meet. Teams traveled
from as far away as Michigan to compete, and the field boasted a few Olympic athletes. Davidson participants were in
the thick of the action.

The meet started Friday afternoon with the 400m hurdles. Junior Maria Whitehead ran a blitzing 67.8. Freshman Lara Burkholder quickly
followed in the open 400m in 62.1. Stephanie Moses (39:41) finished first for Davidson and ninth overall in the 10,000m.
Elizabeth Bishop (40:58) finished 12th overall and Carolyn Meadows finished sixteenth in the strong field.

Davidson’s distance medley relay was the last event Friday evening. The team of Phuong Nguyen (1200m, 3:54), Lara Burkholder (400m,
61.9), Maria Whitehead (800m, 2:28), and Marie Griséz (1600m, 5:21) raced to a respectable 12th place finish.

Saturday morning's events started early with the open 800m run. Sallie Permar ran a personal best (2:29), Karen Marshall (2:32),
and Annie Parsons (2:39) finished quickly behind Permar. In other 800m action, sophomore Marie Grisez raced to a 2:24. In
the 1500m, Jean DeMoss ran to finish in 5:11.

The field events rounded out the Saturday afternoon. Erika Gromelski threw her farthest ever in the discus. Lara Burkholder fought
off the wind to get a mark in the long jump. With a new school record and a personal best,
freshman Vanessa Sims high jumped 5’4 1/2" for fifth place. With only three meets left in the season, the women
thinclads continue to assault the competition.

The Greek Week Fun Run started on Main Street, Saturday morning at 11 a.m. Connor and SAE supported Easter Seals
by sponsoring the 5K road race, which drew close to 50 participants.

Hammerin' Hank's heroic home run

Hank continued from page 14

until the following spring for the broken record.

At the time of his retirement in 1976, Aaron held the record for most games played, at-bats, RBIs, and extra-base
hits, while being ranked second in hits and runs scored.

Still, when people discuss the greatest players of all time, rarely does Hank Aaron surface. Usually names like Ruth, Mays,
Mickey Mantle, Ted Williams, Ty Cobb, and Pete Rose come up first. Aside from the achievements he made on the
field, what Aaron survived off the field can be hard to believe. He was forced to make reservations at several
hotels to conceal his location, and an armed bodyguard accompanied him everywhere he went.

The current generation has never witnessed such hate mail to an athlete based on his skin color. To believe just
20 years ago people went to such extremes is unimaginable.

Hank Aaron has not been put on the pedestal he deserves, then or now. When the subject of greatest players
surfaces, remember Hank Aaron, not just for statistical reasons, but for what he achieved while black players endured such blatant
discrimination. How could our national pastime treat some of its best players with so little respect when they should have
been treated like heroes?
