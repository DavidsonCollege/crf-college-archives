JYA Programs Offer International Education

By FRANCES PALMER and SHANNON ANDERSON

Editor's note: This is the second of two parts on student opportunities to study abroad while attending Davidson.

**Marburg**

Established at the same time as the JYA Montpellier program, the JYA Germany program is located at the Philipps University in Marburg. Marburg is situated 50 miles north of Frankfurt in the upper Lahn Valley. The area around Marburg lies on the southern fringe of the largest contiguously forested area in West Germany. Philipps Universität was founded in 1525 as the world’s first Protestant university and offers courses in practically every academic discipline. A new university library, opened in 1967, houses over half a million volumes.

In basic structure, the Marburg program is quite similar to that of Montpellier. The program is limited to 15 students of any major; a resident advisor accompanies this group also. Marburg students also participate in an intensive language course before joining regular German students in class around October 15. The winter semester takes place from October 15 to February 15 with a Christmas break of three to four weeks. Students again vacation or research individually from February 15-April 15. The summer semester commences on April 15 and concludes on July 15.

Unlike French students, the German students live in university apartments in single-occupancy rooms. Kitchen facilities are available to students on each floor. Dorms are fully coeducational with men and women assigned on a random basis but with Davidson students assigned to the same rooms from year to year in order to mix effectively with German students. German meals, including German beer, soft drinks, and coffee, are available to students in the cafeteria for about $1.50. The Marburg area also hosts numerous restaurants. Extra-curriculars in Marburg include availability of modern sports facilities, hiking trails, musical groups, and volunteer work with service organizations.

The estimated cost of the program, like Montpellier, is comparable to that of a year at Davidson. Financial aid students are eligible to continue receiving aid.

**Art History in France**

During the spring term of even-numbered years, a qualified group of sophomores and seniors participates in an art history seminar. The program does not stipulate majors; it exposes students to various art treasures throughout Western Europe. Students spend the first four weeks of the term in Paris studying 19th-century painting. The remainder of the program focuses on religious architecture of medieval France, with special attention to the cathedral of Chartres. In addition to Davidson tuition, students pay an extra fee for housing and travel expenses. Interested students should contact art professor Larry Ligo for more details.

**Classics Abroad**

Each spring a maximum of twelve Davidson sophomores and juniors participate in a Classics Abroad seminar in cities including Athens, Delphi, Pompeii, Rome, and Florence. The course, having no prerequisites, surveys Greco-Roman civilization from the Stone Age through the Italian Renaissance. Costs include Davidson tuition and a fee to cover living and travel expenses. Classics professor George Labban can provide further information.

**Spain or Mexico**

In alternate years, trips are offered during spring term to Spain and Mexico for qualified students who want to study in a Spanish-speaking country. During the first part of the term in Spain, students study major sites from Spain’s Roman, medieval Christian, Moorish, and Jewish traditions. Students then study Spanish language, literature, and civilization at the University of Madrid while living in homes in the area. Students on the Mexico trip also travel while learning about the rich Spanish and Aztec heritage. The Mexico students concentrate on the Spanish language and modern civilization. A Davidson advisor accompanies each group, and both trips earn students three course credits. With special arrangements, one of the credits can be an independent study.dent study for credit from a department other than Spanish. The cost for the program is Davidson’s comprehensive fee plus any additional costs for program-related activities and round-trip transportation to the country of study. Spanish professor Lois Kemp can provide additional information.

India
Each fall Davidson and UNCC sponsor a 14-week trip of study and travel in India. The students spend eight weeks studying the language, politics, religion, and society of Madras where they also prepare a research project. The remaining weeks the advisor (from Davidson or UNCC) and Archaeological Survey of India lead travel to sites of importance throughout the country. Students are limited to those juniors and seniors wishing to earn three course credits in another country. Interested students should contact South Asian Studies professor Job Thomas.

Cambridge
Each summer the Departments of English and History sponsor a six-week program at Wolfson College of Cambridge University. These departments select 30 qualified rising juniors and seniors of any major to participate in this unique study of a particular period of English history and literature. Students live at Wolfson College and eat at the college commons while taking courses from dons of Cambridge, Oxford, and London. Participants earn one credit in English and one in history. A Davidson professor acts as resident director each year. History professor Malcolm Lester can provide interested students with further information.

Other Study Opportunities
Davidson students are not restricted to these programs, however. Through the international education office, students can learn about numerous programs through other colleges and universities. Study abroad can indeed benefit a well-rounded education as both a personal and global experience. As Sutton said, “A student may not always love the culture and habits of his host country, but he will generally come to understand and tolerate the ‘natives’ and their ‘strange’ ways. This tolerance of and appreciation for things different from our own is the key to a more humane society.”

Credit-Hours
agree. For them, the hours would provide some compensation for the extra lab hours. Williamson said the vote “put us back to square one. It is important to differentiate credit.” Some speculate that the faculty defeated the measure because it wanted to remove a major obstacle to implementing a semester system. Rejecting credit hours eliminates many potential problems, but at the same time, opposing credit hours might harm the implementation of semesters. 

“Probably more wanted a semester calendar than a semester calendar and credit hours,” French said. Others felt that defeating credit hours stripped the semester system of all its benefits.
