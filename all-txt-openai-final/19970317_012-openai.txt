12 THE DAVIDSONIAN

ARTS & LIVING MONDAY, MARCH 17, 1997

By Dorcas, St. GEORGE, AND THE DRAGON

Consulting Astrologists

Pisces (February 19-March 20)—
Do not go gently into that
good night. Despite what
“little” people say about you,
you are as clean as a whistle.
Lucky day: well, every day,
we are talking Hibernia here.
Lucky Charm: a Joshua tree.

Aries (March 21-April 20)—
Davidson can turn one into a
zombie. Fight this lassitude
with a fat Irish coffee. This
works far and away better
than you would imagine.
Lucky Charms: Ulsterites,
lots of them.

Taurus (April 21-May 21)—
This week brings a tempo-
rary malaise. Wail like a ban-
shee if the spirit moves you.
A session with a druid could
be profitable. Lucky Charm:
hair shirt.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)—
Your Momma kissed the
Blarney stone on her last visit
to the Emerald Isle. Your gift
of gab is the congenital result
of this assignation. Don’t be
too chatty, you’ll bore the
craic out of everyone. Lucky
Charm: a mini-Blarney stone,
or any small rock.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)—
Irish eyes are smilin’ on you,
Cancer. Dance a jig. Illuminate
manuscripts and create a psalter
like the Book of Kells. Cook
corned beef and cabbage. If
you’re really daring, corn other
things, like coke, eggs,
andouille sausage, or grape nuts.
Lucky Charm: you.

Leo (July 23-August 22)—
Two vast trunkless legs stand in the
desert. That’s right, look out,
it’s Ozymandias. Last seen
slouching towards Bethlehem
to be born. Lucky Charm:
Norton Anthology.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)—
There is a pot of gold at the end
of your rainbow. Lucky
Charms: Irish tweed, Irish
setter, wolfhound or terrier,
Irish stew, Irish cream, Irish
whiskey, NOT the Irish
Republican Army or the Irish
Cue.

Libra (September 23-October 22)—
This week, avoid Siobhan and her crazy shenanigans. You don’t have the extra
time that is needed to absorb
any shamrock-laden discourses.
Lucky Charm: cranberries.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)—
Top o’ the morning to
you, Scorpions. The gentle
winds of change are blowing
your way. Lucky Charms:
pink hearts, orange stars,
yellow moons, green clovers,
blue diamonds, AND purple
horseshoes.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21)—
There once was a gal Sagittarius,
Whose problems were multi-
farious. She thought she was
glad, but she really was sad.
But sad clowns are very
precarious. Lucky Charm:
cake make-up.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)—
Ride a Shetland
pony to the Outer Hebrides.
Once there, consume haggis
while drinking Scotch.
Um-um good. Do not follow
this advice. Lucky Charm:
English/Gaelic lexicon.

Aquarius (January 20-February 18)—
Watch one film about
Eire. Consult one that em-
ploys every stereotype that
there is about the Irish. Lucky
Charm: a copy of the video
cassette “Darby O’Gill
and the Little People,” star-
ring Sean Connery in the title
role.
