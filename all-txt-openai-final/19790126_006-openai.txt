& Albee-directed, Albee-written play in Love Monday

By LINDA HOOPES
Features Editor

Directors, theatre goers, students, and teachers have long complained that Edward Albee’s plays do not relay the playwright’s intentions when performed. As a result, Albee began to direct his own plays: a year ago in the “Albee Directs Albee” project. This tour group will come to Davidson next Monday, January 29.

What Albee originally conceived as a sixteen-week tour, with the aid of producer Mark Amitin, has extended for over forty weeks. At the close of the tour, a New York production is expected to follow, as well as invitations from the city of Hong Kong and the United States Department of State to tour India. So far, the project has made over 180 performances on all University of California campuses, the Kennedy Center, Columbia University, and others.

Albee, who has won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama twice in the last twelve years, will be unable to come to Davidson. However, the entire entourage has been under his sole direction for nearly a year, so he will no doubt be present in spirit. Two one-act plays, The Zoo Story and The American Dream, are to be presented. Hosted by the Cultural Events Committee, performances are to be back-to-back at 8:15 pm in Love Auditorium. Tickets are $1.00 for students and faculty, $3.00 for the public.

Notes on Students
New Union Committee Chairmen

On the Monday after Midwinters, the new Union Committee Chairmen are going to take office. During December, the President and the Vice-presidents of Social and of Co-Curricular activities were elected. Since then, they have been seeking and interviewing candidates for the committee chairmanships. This week those leaders were chosen. The new chairmen are:

Concert committee—Al Rak; Dance—Mark Duckett; Dorm Social—Susan Bane; Games—Fess Crockett; Intimate Performers—Mariellen Sawada; Outing Club—Craige Murray; Pop Films—Bill Peeples; Gallery—John Miller Mayfield; Minorities—Julie Holding; Fine Films—Donya Boylston; Cultural Events—Frizzle Willis; Crafts—John Highsmith; Speakers—Ann Tutwiler; Secretary/Treasurer—Weezie Mann.

According to William Brown, “a lot of people” were interviewed for these positions. No one came forward to be interviewed for Poetry Committee—that position is still open.

The change-over after Midwinters is a fairly new policy. Up until last year, the President and Vice-presidents were elected in December and took office after Christmas. This left them with no experience, and no committee chairmen. Under the new procedure, the major officers are still elected in December, but they serve an internship to “learn the ropes” until after Midwinters. During this time they choose new committee chairmen.

26 Different ways to combat the dreaded winter blahs

By LINDA HOOPES

“All students suffer from a morale slump in January or February. Be prepared to hear talk of dropping out or transferring. Be alert and prepared. Send more mail: Send an unexpected record or book or item of clothing or a check. Make a phone call, just to be sociable.” —A Handbook for Parents, Davidson College.

Let’s face it—at one time or another, all of us are afflicted with the dreaded “winter blahs.” When you wake up to anotherDrippy, grey day, another test, another paper, it’s hard to drag the old bod out of bed. If you’re looking for something different, read on! You are about to be presented with the most imaginative, creative, fancy-tickling list of “blah-beaters” ever! Some are free, some aren’t, some are solo ventures, and some require the presence of at least one friend. But they all have one thing in common—they leave the responsibility up to you to keep from being bored.

* Invite your favorite person to lunch.
* Send yourself (or your favorite person) a flower.
* Bake cookies.
* Check out a good science fiction, mystery, or romance book.
* Clean your room from top to bottom.
* Reserve Erwin Lodge and have a small dinner party (steaks, wine, salad, and a fire in the fireplace).
* Get a new poster to brighten up your room or a new album to listen to.
* Learn a new card game (bridge, Go-Fish, etc.).
* Start running every day, or jump rope if the weather is gross (very invigorating!).
* Get to know the cooks at your eating house or the servers at Slater—they get the blahs too!
* Drop by and talk to a professor sometime when he’s free—about anything but classwork.
* Write a thank-you note to somebody for something they’ve done that you noticed and appreciated but never mentioned.
* Have a hot chocolate and cheese party.
* If you're an upperclassman—get a few friends and eat at Slater some Saturday night.
* Send a care-package to a friend (at Davidson or elsewhere).
* Short-sheet your roommate’s bed.
* Call someone long-distance—it’s worth the splurge!
* Start a game of Monopoly and play it in your spare time.
* Send a “secret admirer” letter to some unsuspecting person.
* Have a hall birthday party for everyone on your hall who was born in the summer and never gets to celebrate his birthday with all his friends around.
* On a clear night, check out a telescope and go star-gazing.
* Watch the submarine races at Lake Norman.
* Buy some firewood and have a snuggle-up study break party at your eating house some chilly night.
* Write a poem or a song (just for yourself or to share).

If you can’t find anything appealing in the list, there is always room for personal creativity. A few guidelines for writing ideal alternatives: think positive, do something for yourself or for someone else, be constructive (or at least funny, but not harmful), and finally, once you’ve come up with an idea, do it!

**Bowl Team Wins Second at Wake**

Davidson's Varsity College Bowl Team came in second place last Saturday at an invitational tournament at Wake Forest. Davidson was one of seven teams participating. Davidson beat UNCC and UNCG, but lost to Chapel Hill. The final score of the Davidson-Chapel Hill game, 340-310, may be a mistake; the Davidson team has written to Wake Forest because they did not get credit for one question they answered.
