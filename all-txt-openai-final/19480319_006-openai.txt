On the Davidson campus

MOORESVILLE THEATRES

In Davidson did Mr. Stough a stately pleasure dome decree, where the city’s foremost street did once more repeat. This
is the town's disgrace of what was once a fine garage. He sought most ably to make an enterprise to
help him rake into swelling tills the mintage of those who should have been in bed, yet this house he
nightly fills with those who have a lazy quirk, a state of mind so very murk. We have such us
to here expound facts that they are forced to seek. For movies’ nature for the week can by them be
found.

Be quite well entertained on the second eve of Tuesday the twenty-third. Garfield and Palmer will appear in a picture
making clear why prize fighters tell in “Body and Soul” you will find a tale not very whimsical, a spirit’s
clash with the physical. Hazel Brooks and Lilli Palmer vie for John Garfield’s attention. Who to calm her, the other’s
name has caused dissension.

From the lines above (printed in a recent editor's note) you can probably deduce that “Body and Soul” will be
playing Monday and Tuesday, March 22 and 23. This brings to mind the thought that perhaps we should publish a
schedule of the movies for the coming week so that utilitarians will be able to know what movie is being
shown without having to decipher a lot of pretentious poetry.

Monday and Tuesday March 22 and 23 “BODY AND SOUL” Wednesday and Thursday March 24 and 25 “MAGIC TOWN” Thursday-Sat.
March 25-27 “HOME TOWN”

Now that we have provided the advertisement that supposedly pays for this space, we can return to our less serious
mood. Since nothing can be said in defense of the RKO production “Magic Town,” perhaps something can be said in
the way of attack. Stewart, Wyman, and RKO bring you this undelightful show. Not that pleased away you'll go, but
just to rake in all your dough. It's the story of some small hole and a guy taking a galloping
poll, the results of which are not so droll because he was forced to sell his soul. To start a
quarrel is not quite moral, but it gives the laurel that is rather immoral.

It might be well to state that the actual name of the movie for Friday and Saturday is “Prince of
Thieves.” However, this title was not at all appropriate for the holiday theme. Naturally, no one wants to learn all
the interesting facts about this picture since no one will be here while it is playing. So without further verbosity,
we bid you a happy holiday, appending only this admonition—don't have any life-raising experiences!

AMONG THE GREEKS... (Continued From Page Five)

Day which was held last Saturday, and the Sigmas seem to have been well represented at this little affair. Numbered
among the “dealers” as we remember quite hurriedly, were Brothers H. Williams, Suggs, Currant, Jones, Kelly, Page, Torrence, Dudley, Waters,
Pearson, Crosland, and Roddey. Suggs wasn’t seen around Salem too long but we were assured it was he who was
at the wheel of the Buick which didn't seem in too good a condition. Freeman said he was really his
escort. She had lived in Philadelphia all her life and didn't even know who the Phillies were. Betty Ann then
never portrayed the month of March in the Salem version of the Varga Calendar. “Plato” never batted an eye and
Pete's girls looked prettier than ever. Horseshoe pitching seems to be well established as an afternoon sport behind the house
nowadays. The best (they say) is Senator Wall and...The Mouse-Man. Our social team to John Springs function is set for
April 3. It was decided to have sort of an all-day affair at the River Station instead of the regular
theme which is usually had. There will be music there, the dancing probably by one player or piccolo. Also noted
was the fact that our president, Bob Phillips, who was reported last semester, was re-elected for another semester. Congrats, Bob,
keep up the good work.

PI KAPPA ALPHA

The following song of rather simple character, to be sung to the tune of that catchy little ditty, “Uum-un is
a friend of mine,” was the general feeling of the Pika group after the recent Salem-Davidson celebration:

Salem is the place for me,
All the girls are filled with glee,
What a place to have a spree,
This we Pikas all agree.

Did I say all? Well, all but two. Colkitt and Walker spent their time looking for paper sacks, and their
dates just couldn't understand why. The coterie of bourgeoisie that traveled by bus seemed to have exhausted all the jokes
and songs in the book and a few that couldn't be printed. Everything from “Flow Gently Sweet Afton,” to “Major
Morgan's Troopers,” was thrashed, lambasted, trounced, scourged, beat, crucified and, oh yes, sung. The jokes were predominantly of the traveling
salesman variety, but Confucius ran him a close second.

C.D. “I wonder who's kissing her now” Hamm has run into stiff competition. What has Hamm so worried is the
fact he also forgot to send a valentine. Page Jackson stole the show during the “Salem Girl Calendar” presentation. We
haven't as yet decided what month he represented. And while we are on the subject, Wylie Smith could hardly wait
until after the ninth month, October.

Not to omit the leading plutocrats from the Pika social register, we must mention “Creep” Craig, who managed to talk
the long arm of the law out of a speeding ticket on the return trip from Salem—7 gallons of gas
for a 50-mile trip. Maybe you should try parking. Ted Somner was seen in the early afternoon going into the
May Dell with his date. He was next seen late that night coming out of the May Dell with his
date. Time just slipped up on him. Mills and Cameron are taking this leap year business seriously. They made their
dates take them to the Country Club for dinner, and one of the date’s roommate's mother even drove them out.
“Red” Tillinghast doesn’t believe in the old maxim, “Don’t change horses in the middle of the stream.” He also did
some impromptu, exhibitionist jitterbugging for an enthusiastic audience. For all we know, Dockery's date is still waiting for him to
get there. Such faith is refreshing.

Congratulations to Randy Ensign who will represent us on the Pan-Hell Council next year. The Beta Chapter of the Pi
Kappa Alpha Fraternity announces with pleasure the initiation of R. J. Grube and the pledging of A. W. Gregory and
B. S. Tillinghast.
