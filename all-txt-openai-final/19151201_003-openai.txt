through center and was not tackled before he had crossed the goal. Billings ran his team well and his beautiful
tackle of Black, who had intercepted a forward pass and run 35 yards, prevented Davidson from scoring earlier. Witherington did
some excellent punting for Wake Forest until he withdrew near the end of the first half.

SURVEY OF GAME

During the first quarter neither goal was seriously threatened. In the second quarter Davidson reached the 2-yard line only to
lose the ball on a fumble. For the rest of the game both Davidson and Wake Forest, except when they
scored, did not seriously menace each other’s goal. The sweeping end run, Black and C. Walker carrying the ball, was
the play which Davidson relied upon for most of her gains. Line bucks by Parker and Pace were Wake Forest’s
instrument for gains.

WAKE FOREST SCORES

The opening of the second half saw Wake Forest fighting with an added impetus. Billings kicked to Davidson's 10-yard line.
Laird returned 15, but was tackled so hard that he fumbled. Wake Forest recovered. Howell plowed through Davidson's line for
8 yards. After swerving Davidson's secondary defense to the left, Billings called on Pace to go through center on a
delayed pass. He found an open road and reached goal before being tackled by Lawson. Billings kicked goal.

DAVIDSON’S SECOND SCORE

Being scored on so quickly and to all appearances quite easily, Davidson came
