**Editorial**

Administrators say the current pass/fail system allows students to explore classes in unfamiliar disciplines without risking a low grade. While
there is merit in encouraging students to explore different departments by removing the pressure to preserve their grade point averages,
the system fails when a student does unexpectedly well in his or her pass/fail class. We have to decide six
weeks into the semester whether to utilize the pass/fail option. Many classes don’t assign graded material until close to or
after the Feb. 25 deadline. It is oftentimes impossible for students to gauge how poorly, or how well, they might
perform. We must decide, with very little information on which to base our decision, whether a class might be difficult
enough to take pass/fail. Once we’ve made the pass/fail decision, we cannot revoke it. What happens, then, if we realize
that we can do well in the class? There is no way for our GPAs to benefit from the high
grade we may receive. Taking a class pass/fail effectively removes our motivation to perform at our full potential.

While grades are not the sole objectives of education, we rely on them for graduate school placements, job opportunities, and
scholarship money. So shouldn’t we benefit from every high grade we receive and from all of our hard work that
we put into classes? We understand why a student cannot invoke the pass/fail option after a poor final grade is
revealed. But when we perform unexpectedly well in the class, there is no reason we shouldn’t be able to withdraw
the pass/fail. Allowing revocation would provide students a pass/fail system that is completely beneficial to them. Since the pass/fail option
is available, we would continue to try new courses without fear of poor grades. But since we could uncover the
final grade if we chose to, incentive would remain for us to excel.

**Nothing wrong with bumper stickers**

In response to “What do patriotism and basketball have in common? (Jan. 30, Letter to the Editor)”. I usually read
The Davidsonian’s perspectives page with perfunctory interest, but Vic Lindsay’s ill-informed editorial invites, nay, requires a sardonic reproach. Mr. Lindsay
decries the patriotic bumper stickers that people have displayed in response to Sept. 11 as a “money-making scheme.” Instead of
this insincere, jingoistic display of pride, he argues we should unite by attending sundry athletic events. Are people that proudly
wear a bumper sticker on their car insincere simply because many others do it? Would he rather they exhibit no
emotion at all? If anything, I believe this will help “unite the country.” I for one feel a common bond
when I pass cars on the interstate with “God Bless the U.S.A.” stickers on their bumpers.

Mr. Lindsay then proceeds to fire off a barrage of unsubstantiated assertions. His most egregious and hackneyed one condemns the
Supreme Court as “misguided” in ending the presidential election fiasco. If Mr. Lindsay had taken the pains to research his
illegitimate claim, he might have read the recent article in The New York Times (not exactly a bastion of conservatism),
“EXAMINING THE VOTE: THE OVERVIEW; Study of Disputed Florida Ballots Finds Justices Did Not Cast the Deciding Vote” (Nov. 12,
page 1A). Is it our “patriotic” duty to fight for Al Gore even though he irrefutably lost?

The editorial then comes to the farcical and incoherent conclusion that by attending various Davidson athletic events, we will be
able to unite the country. After reading this spurious and rambling piece, I still have little idea of what patriotism
and basketball have in common.

**Lecture can offer much more than a lesson on forgiveness**

Hey all.I want to start off by apologizing for my article beforehand. This piece promises not to be funny, disgusting,
or offensive. In fact, I am going to do my best to be somewhat insightful. But first, I will issue
a guarantee. I promise there will be, from this point on, no mention of dancing bears, the word redonkulous, gnomes,
or statues of Martin Luther King. So let it be written... so let it be done. Now on with the
article.

Tim Cook ‘04

There’s a speaker next week that, I believe, promises to be very interesting indeed. Dean Greg Jones of Duke Divinity
School is scheduled to lecture in the 900 Room on Monday night on the subject of forgiveness. But it’s not
just forgiveness like I forgave my brother for stealing my lunch money when I was six, or like when I
forgave my trigonometry teacher in high school for giving me a D. This is big-time forgiveness — forgiving people who
have left devastating scars on the lives of Americans all over the country.

I want to do a couple of things in this article. First, I want to convince as many people as
possible to come see the lecture. And second, I want to get us all thinking about the topic before we
go, or just have us think in case we can’t or don’t want to go.

Forgiveness is one of the hardest things in the world to do. And it is especially difficult to forgive when
death is involved. Well, it should be hard. If it was easy to forgive someone for taking someone away from
us forever, then I guess it means we don’t really care or that we haven’t thought enough about it. The
Sept. 11 terrorists killed many Americans and devastated a lot more. But holding a grudge is not the answer. Seeking
retribution is not the answer. Hate is not the answer. These paths are the wrong ones because they do nothing
to treat the wounds inflicted on us and in us. They only open more wounds by taking over our lives
and letting rage eat away at our souls.

Forgiveness, I feel, is the path to becoming a stronger person. To forgive takes great effort and energy. It humbles
us and often makes us feel beaten — like we are too cowardly to take a stand. But true forgiveness
comes when we can accept our transgressors no matter if they refuse to accept us. It’s that peaceful feeling inside
that reminds us that we will heal and that no earthly act has enough power to break us completely.

I would love to comment on the whole debate over forgetting and forgiving, turning the other cheek, but Dr. Jones
is planning on commenting on forgiveness being confused with pacifism in his lecture, so I will leave that to the
professionals.

My other point about getting people to this lecture is that forgiveness is an especially difficult thing for college students
to face. We are away from our homes. We are away from the ones who brought us up. And this
is the time in our lives that we are most fragile. This is a time when something like 9/11 can
shatter our image of God, sense of order in the universe, or whatever it is that we believe in. We
are at a time when we say, “How could you let this happen? Why didn’t you stop this?” College is
a time where we either find what we’re looking for or lose what we have had. We are susceptible to
rage and hate because our ideologies might be weak and we are not sure where we stand. I know this
firsthand. First, your studies take you to the edge of your faith. Then war or death push you over. I
think that is the very reason for us to attend this lecture. This is not some Christian plea. This is
a spiritual one. Let us not allow our fragile four years to leave us bitter and engulfed in rage. Let
us seek solace in forgiveness. This is no call for religion. This is a call for inner peace.

Hope to see you there. Oh, yeah, thanks mom for the insight, hope you feel better.
