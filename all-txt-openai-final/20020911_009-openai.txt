Sports gave us comfort in time of grief

One year ago today, we all realized just how trivial sports really are. Sadly, it took a national tragedy of
unprecedented scale for people to discover that, at best, sports are a small diversion and nothing more. Sept. 11, 2001,
will forever be etched in our minds, and it goes without saying that America’s response to the tragedy created an
extraordinary sense of national pride. A wave of patriotism swept across the country, engulfing each and every one of us.

For the week or so following the attacks, we were no longer defined by where we lived, who we worshipped,
or what team we supported. Instead, we joined together as Americans, united as one and dedicated to a common cause.
Helping those who lost loved ones became a top priority, and no one really cared about sports for the time
being. Athletic venues across the country turned eerily silent, as the attacks on New York, Washington D.C., and Pennsylvania paralyzed
the sports world.

When the games eventually returned, all the sorrow, pride, and patriotism that we, as a nation, were feeling could also
be seen in the eyes of the players. And just as we were discovering our country’s acute overemphasis on athletics,
we also came to appreciate the power these games have to draw us together as a community. Many found solace
as the stadiums began to reopen, with the games serving as an escape from the sadness. Our safety zones seriously
violated, we turned to sports for comfort.

Some will say that the games returned too soon, that it was insensitive and disrespectful to resume play. Others maintain
that continuing with the schedule was just what the American public needed: a small amount of joy during such a
tragic time. Looking back on it all, it’s hard to say whether the right choice was made. Nevertheless, the games
returned with full force, highlighted by one of the more memorable World Series in recent memory. Americans of all backgrounds
gathered together once again in beautiful stadiums, under starlit nights, and discovered a brief respite from all the shock and
horror. Although we still grieved as a nation, sports offered us a strong sense of participation and of something shared.

As for the long-term effects of 9/11 on American sports, unfortunately, but not surprisingly, nothing has really changed. Greed is
still common among professional athletes, and simply playing for the love of the game seems to be a lost art
in our culture. Witness the U.S. basketball team self-destructing at the World Championships last week, finishing sixth after losing to
Argentina, Yugoslavia, and Spain. If we are to take anything from last year’s attacks, however, it should be that there
is so much more to life than sports. Play the games, have fun, and enjoy them as much as possible,
but realize that in the grand scheme of things, a life will never be valued merely by athletic success.

The quarterback is the most visible part of a football team. He is the most watched, most criticized, and most
praised. The position is one of unusual pressure. It’s a pressure that Paul Nichols, Davidson’s senior quarterback, understands and embraces.
“Quarterback is unlike any other position on the field,” he says. “It is greatly magnified so I take a great
deal of pride in my personal play and the care of the offense.”

Throughout a long season, there are bound to be high points and low points, touchdown passes and interceptions. The key,
he says, is approaching each game and each individual play focusing only on the situation at hand. Nichols, 5-11, 190
pounds, isn’t the most gifted athlete on the roster, but he may be the hardest working. He enters his third
season as the starting QB with a 15-3 record, more than 3,000 yards of passing, and a wealth of experience.
“As a quarterback, I try to have a short memory and be relatively patient,” he said. “A good quarterback must
maintain an excellent work ethic and remain patient within the course of a game, knowing that the chance for a
big play will come.”

Seeing the sacrifice of his teammates inspires Nichols to keep up his work ethic and remain focused on winning. “My
main motivation is the success of the team,” he says.

The Wildcats’ offensive line, or “boars” as they like to call themselves, specialize in doing the work in the trenches
that may go unnoticed by most fans but is vital to the success of the team. And they don’t want
things any other way. Just ask senior center Jon Davis. “We love doing the dirty work so the backs and
receivers can get into the end zone,” Davis says. “Our motto is ‘hell up the middle’ because that’s how we
want to play.”

After a 2001 season in which he played every down and made the First Team All-PFL South Division, Davis returns
as the anchor of the line and one of the most important players on the team. This summer, he was
named to The Sports Network’s I-AA Mid-Major Preseason All-America team. Davis, a 5-10, 240-pounder from Crystal Beach, Fla., says it
takes a certain mindset to play effectively as a lineman: Focus, technique, emotion, and what he calls “controlled aggression.”comes from
being around a team that works extremely hard with an intense desire to win. I could not let anybody on
this team down because of the trust and work ethic they have all placed in me.”

‘Reckless abandon’ he calls “a reckless abandon.” “To be a good lineman, you need to understand the blocking schemes and
be able to apply your assignments on the fly. A lineman with great technique can dominate at the line of
scrimmage. It is also necessary to play with a high level of emotion because a lineman needs to have a
killer mentality.”

Davis, along with fellow linemen Will McMurray, Tim Robertson, Ken Franklin, and Blair Reynolds, take that killer mentality to its
highest level as they work to control the line of scrimmage and push the team to victory. The team, which
Davis describes as a tightly knit family, is where he finds the motivation to come out and play every week.
That’s what will drive him most in his final year of collegiate football. In his words, “There is nothing better
than running out on that field to go to battle with your teammates.”

Sackmaster aims to shut down offenses

Ryan Tennis had 7.5 sacks last year, which tied him for the Pioneer League lead. In his three seasons at
Davidson, he’s racked up nearly 100 yards in sacks, to go along with countless other disruptions. His explanation for the
success is pretty simple. “It’s an all-out race to the quarterback,” says Tennis, a 6-1, 235-pound lineman from Bryn Athyn,
Pa.

It might be a little more complicated than that. Tennis cites the hook-grab-slip as his favorite move to get past
linemen and into the face of the quarterback. The technique has the pass-rusher “attack one side of the offensive lineman,
hook his hands, grab his shoulder and pull it down, and slip your arm over him and your hips by
him,” he says.

Tennis’ defensive skills, however, go beyond pass rushing. He uses his quickness and agility to upset the running game as
well, and he recorded 17 tackles-for-losses last year to lead the league. Returning for his senior season as a leader
of the defense, Tennis wakes up every Saturday aiming to dominate. “I go into every game hoping to have the
defense shut out our opponent,” he says. “It might not always happen, but that’s the mentality you need to have.”

Part of the motivation for that approach comes from his passion for football. “I just love the game more than
almost anything else,” he says, “and I always have.” And there’s always the satisfaction of planting the quarterback behind the
line of scrimmage. “It’s definitely the ultimate feeling as a defensive lineman,” he says. “It’s our equivalent to a touchdown.”

Double trouble looms in the secondary

Adam Elmore sets himself in his defensive stance and stares intently at the offense. As a free safety, he knows
that he is the team’s last line of defense against a game-changing touchdown play. Suddenly, the quarterback calls out an
audible, and the receivers change their formation. Adam looks toward the strong safety—his twin brother Graham—and begins calling for an
adjustment in the coverage. Before he is halfway through his instructions, the strong safety has already moved into position. It’s
like they’ve been doing this together their entire lives.

“It’s nice having my brother play right beside me on the field,” says Graham. “I’ve never played on a defense
without him as the free safety.” Adam feels the same way: “Not many people can say they’ve played with the
same teammate like we have,” he said. “This will be our 14th year of football, and it’s really been great.
It makes it so much easier to play a position beside.”

The brothers came to Davidson from Burns High in Lawndale, N.C., where they patrolled the defensive secondary just as they
do here. Communication is one of the keys to playing safety. Making defensive adjustments requires both safeties to constantly be
on the same page.

“Playing with Adam is a huge advantage when it comes to communicating on the field,” says Graham. “It’s hard in
the defensive backfield because we are constantly changing our assignments before every play. We have to adjust to what the
offense gives us. Lots of times I find myself looking over and pointing or making some kind of gesture to
Adam to make sure we are on the same page. That’s something I probably couldn’t do with anyone else.”

Big hits and interceptions are other intangible aspects of the safety positions. When asked which they prefer to do, the
brothers have different opinions. “I like to make the hits,” Adam said. Says Graham: “Our goal on defense is to
get off the field as soon as possible so our offense will have a chance to score. So picking off
a pass is what every defensive back wants to do.”

They both, however, share a common goal. They want to help the Wildcats take the Pioneer League Championship at the
end of the season. And in their last season of football together, they are determined not to let their teammates,
or each other, down. “It’s been nice having someone to push me for the last 14 years,” Adam reflects. “It’s
helped make me a better player.”
