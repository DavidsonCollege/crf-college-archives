### William Attwood and His Views

The former Look editor covered a world of topics

By MARVIN OVERBY ’83

William Attwood, the 1983 Woodrow Wilson Visiting Fellow, has spent this past week on campus speaking on subjects ranging from “U.S. Foreign Policy” to “Writing, Reporting, and Editing.” A journalist by profession, and a former diplomat, Attwood enjoyed a long and successful career that included such distinguished positions as editor-in-chief of Look magazine, the United States Ambassador to two African nations, and, more recently, the publisher and president of Newsday, a Long Island newspaper.

Attwood began his journalism career in 1946 when he became a correspondent in the Washington Bureau of the New York-Herald Tribune. During the next three years, he also served the Tribune as a European correspondent and as its United Nations correspondent. In 1949, he returned to Europe while working for Colliers magazine and began writing a nationally syndicated column. Of his days in Paris, Mr. Attwood commented: “I was not bored.”

In 1951, Attwood left Colliers to become European editor for Look magazine. Working for Look until 1961, he became national affairs editor and the foreign editor.

Active in the 1960 presidential race, Attwood served as a speechwriter for both Adlai Stevenson and John F. Kennedy. In 1961, President Kennedy appointed him United States Ambassador to Guinea. Attwood remained active in U.S./African diplomacy until 1966, serving successively as Ambassador to Guinea, Kenya, and adviser on African Affairs with the U.S.’s UN mission.

Attwood believes that “it is no longer enough just to say that we have to bring down the inflation rate.”

In May 1966, Attwood returned to journalism as editor-in-chief of Look. In August 1967, he was named vice-president and director of Cowles Communications, Inc., Look’s parent company. In 1970, he was hired as president and publisher of Newsday, and he became chairman of the board in 1978. Attwood retired from Newsday in July 1979.

Speaking on Tuesday night with Wachovia Visiting Distinguished Professor Lafayette Diggs of Liberia, Attwood addressed “Misconceptions about Africa.” Attwood favors what he calls a “4F” policy in Africa. The United States, he said, must be firm in protecting its interests, frank in identifying what its interests are, friendly toward the nations of the continent, and fair in our aid programs.

Attwood voiced his concern that the U.S. be very careful how it handles the Republic of South Africa. Since that country’s apartheid is the “single most emotional issue on the continent,” should the U.S. support South Africa, we would alienate the countries of Africa. This, Attwood suggested, would only help the Soviet Union.

Attwood said that two conditions have to be met to improve the U.S. position in Africa. First, America must seek to change the perception that it is tacitly supporting the Pretorian regime by making investments in South Africa seem unattractive to American businesses. Second, the U.S. must push the South Africans to withdraw from Namibia. Attwood admitted a certain pessimism about a South African withdrawal, admitting, “I won’t believe it until I see it happening.”

About conditions in the rest of Africa, Attwood is more “hopeful.” He noted that many countries in Africa had made a good deal of progress with surprisingly little disturbance. “There has been amazingly little bloodshed in Africa,” he said, “especially when compared with this nation’s Civil War.”

“Africans are seeing that the Marxist-Leninist road to development is not the best one,” he remarked. The “Soviets have very little to offer. . . . The Soviets, by and large, don’t speak French or English or Portuguese and don’t have the financial strength to give the Africans the aid they need.”

Attwood spoke on Wednesday afternoon on “Disturbing Trends in U.S. Politics.” He enumerated indifference, lack of confidence in political institutions, lack of knowledge about political institutions, and a feeling of individual impotence as the most disturbing developments in American politics.

Fielding questions on a variety of issues, Attwood predicted that the 1984 presidential election would feature Howard Baker versus “Fritz” Mondale (“Reagan won't run again unless there is a big upturn in the economy”). Quoting an unnamed political commenter, he said that “Mondale’s biggest problem will be that his name sounds like a suburb of Los Angeles.”

Attwood also said that the U.S. must find somewhere a political leader who will get the country out of the current “crushing arms race” and the resurgent cold war. “It is no longer enough,” he maintained, “just to say we have to bring down the inflation rate.”

Among Attwood’s achievements during his career as journalist and diplomat are his visits to over 70 countries, his trip to China in 1971, and his interviews with Prince Sihanouk of Cambodia and Premier Chou En-Lai of the People’s Republic of China. He has published four books and has received the National Headliners Club Award, the George Polk Memorial Award, and the Page One Award for excellence in journalism.
