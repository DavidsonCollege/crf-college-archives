Pasko Three Â° Wildcat Sports

Playing an alert brand of tennis throughout, the snappy team of Gene Linton and Pinker McGinnis ousted the favored team
of Gene Sutton and Lacy McLean in the finals of the Doubles Tournament held last Friday. The winners took the
first set after encountering stiff opposition, 7-5; Sutton-McLean came back to win the second set easily 6-2, but the champions
closed the last set out in rapid fashion, 6-1. McGinnis virtually put on a one-man show, as the singles champion
had good control of his shots and won 6-2, but the duo came back to dominate with counters in their
last set, ending the count in the second with a four-run rally.

The semi-final round provided some fast action with Sutton-McLean eliminating the dark horse entry of Yorderson-Capps after a terrific struggle,
7-5, 6-2. The tournament victors eliminated the Wood-Horton team without much trouble. The tournament was a big success, and all
matches were played off according to schedule.

HORSESHOE ACTION REACHES QUARTER FINALS

The doubles pitching reached the quarter-finals and the final matches were played off at the end of the week. Pairings
are as follows:

- Parks vs. Bell-Peters
- Holland-Lay vs. Sutton-Stubbs
- Royster-Sutton vs. Delaney-Winchester
- McLean-Harris vs. Little-Sand

The matches have all been very close and the final action should provide some fast pitching competition.

In the Duke game at bat, over five runs in the second inning were scored when second-baseman Charlie Capps hit
the last pitch with two for four, leading to a dominant performance.
