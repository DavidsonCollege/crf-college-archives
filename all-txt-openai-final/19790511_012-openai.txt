#### The Dead can still shake down a street

By JIM VITHA
Staff Writer

There have been many criticisms levied at the Grateful Dead as of late. Their latest album, *Shakedown Street*, while having
many fine points, was met with mixed reviews and mediocre commercial success.

Granted, the Grateful Dead could be considered mere vestiges of a musical era somewhat forgotten in these days of disco
and pluralistic rock and roll. However, seeing the Grateful Dead at the Charlotte Coliseum last Thursday, May 4, assuaged any
fears that the Grateful Dead should be considered a washed-up remnant of the sixties.

The Charlotte date was the first date of their new tour and while they had some sound difficulties, the band
played with an intensity that was almost overwhelming at times. The crowd at the coliseum was extremely enthusiastic and typical
of Grateful Dead crowds throughout the years.

Perhaps the most interesting part of the concert began when they played "Shakedown Street." The album *Shakedown Street* has been
viewed with some disdain by more traditional Grateful Dead fans; however, the album definitely has merit in its own right.
Many in the audience were awed by the immense sound and harmonies delivered by the band during this song as
well as during the different solo efforts put forth following the song.

Jerry Garcia is still, unquestionably, one of the most accomplished and professional guitarists playing today. When accompanied by Phil Lesh,
they make up a duo that ranks with such stars as the Rolling Stones’ Keith Richards and Ron Wood. Their
improvisational jamming technique is unique and at the same time artistically inspiring.

The Grateful Dead can produce as much energy and excitement as any rock band can. However, the songs take on
a more interesting, complex sound which leaves the listener wondering what the original writer of the song really meant when
the song was written. Needless to say, the Grateful Dead are very much alive in the sense that many fans,
Deadheads or not, still enjoy their music rather immensely. The concert proved this fact and displayed the talents of a
band who, throughout the years, have consistently put out good music, whether on an album or live on stage.

### Shelley and Foster present joint recital

Shelley, a senior economics major, has studied piano this year with Professor Jim Swisher. He will play works by Bach,

more appropriate night to have my recital." Foster has studied voice for two years with Professor Donald Plott and currently
