**The Christmas Story**
Luke 2: 1-20

Now when it came to pass in those days, there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed. (And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.) And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city. And Joseph also went from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:) To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child. And so it was, that while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered. And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn. And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night. And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring to you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men. And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us. And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger. And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning the child. And all that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds. But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart. And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.

**As the Year Ends**
Christmas—1940. Another year almost gone, a year which has seen sweeping changes in the political and economic world; a year in which blood has deeply stained the soil of the earth; a year which will not soon be forgotten. This Christmas is not too different, in some respects, from last Christmas. Last year there were bombers over Europe, but not so many. Last year there was a food shortage in the war-stricken countries, but not so bad. Last year there were grief-stricken parents, and dead boys, but not so many. Then there was no draft. There is now. Then we were determined to stay out of war at all costs. Now we are not so sure. Then we were bitterly debating the advisability of giving Mr. Roosevelt a third term. Now we have done it, and the country is solidly behind him. Then we had fifth columnists in our vital industries. Now it appears that these same persons, or others like them, are still here. Not so long ago France was supposedly a thriving republic. But that has changed. Not so long ago Italy was a non-belligerent partner in the Axis. That also has changed. Not so long ago only a few European nations were at war. That, too, is different. Vast and almost unbelievable changes these are in some cases. But in most, the new ones come directly out of the old, and gradually enough for all to foresee the future for a little. And no one expects changes to stop now. In another year there will probably be more difference in the world and national situation, or crisis (or better yet, series of crises), than there has been during the past three hundred and sixty-five days. That, too, is already foreseen by our various commentators. To what does it all lead? Armageddon? A better and more stable world condition? Who knows? Who could? Certainly no human. So many analyses of the world situation and its events have already been made that it is rather useless to attempt to find any possible solution to the “mess”—and it is a “mess.” But when all things are stripped of any outward camouflage, the entire situation resolves into a struggle between bad and worse; for we can hardly call the system which we strive to maintain good in its present form, although we believe that it is good as an ideal, and are sure it at least is better than that which is enforced in many other lands.

Just why is there the firm conviction in the hearts of most of us that the Axis forces cannot win the war? Our newsmen tell us that it is entirely possible. But do they really believe that? Does our nation as a whole think that Hitler’s might will eventually rule? No! And why “no”? Is it because we believe the Allies (what is left of them) have the military power to overcome Hitler and Co. or have more “stickability”? Is it because we think that America will back Britain up to such a large extent that the Axis will be finally defeated? Is it because we are convinced that several other powers will join the British against Germany and Italy? Is it, in the final analysis, because of any tangible reason? We do not believe that it is. It is our opinion that the main reason Americans deep inside tenaciously cling to the belief that our system of government and that of the English and other nations will survive is a spiritual one. We are convinced that “right will triumph,” although we do not express our conviction any more in this age of sophistication and worldliness. But that is the feeling inside our hearts and minds, deeply buried there nevertheless. Our nation is called “Christian,” it is only nominally so. But it always has been true, and will continue to be so, that when the arms of misfortune, evil, and pestilence reach out for us, it is to God that we turn. Far beneath any false exterior, our souls recognize our Maker, and depend on Him for strength in times of crisis. This cannot be denied, for it is even true at so hardened a place as college. And now as the year passes, we need Him to help us through the difficult days which lie ahead. Why do we in America not recognize this need, and confess our Lord openly? For when the outlook is dark, He remains with us, through all things.

**Christmas—1940**
By JULIAN McCALL

Congratulations to the Council on Midwinter dances! This column has been plugging Wil Bradley all year and is convinced that he has just the band for us. Because Wil Bradley can play trombone sweet and hot, both night, he has attained top positions in both dance music and radio. Glenn is the best all-round trombone player in the country and “Metronome,” a musical magazine, elected him to its hall of fame. The band, 40 strong, features Ray McKinley on drums, Freddie Slack on piano, and Jimmy Valentine as vocalist. It has a lift and kick most competitors would think themselves fortunate to attain. The section, headed by Bradley, shines brilliantly whether playing ensemble or splitting into solo choruses. Saxes blend neatly and execute difficult passages with precision. While capable of out-swinging almost any of today’s bands, Bradley and McKinley's crew furnish an amazingly flexible brand of dance-time. With Wil's trombone leading the melodic procession, the boys do well by the sweetest ballad and can also turn out a creditable rhumba. McKinley is one of the best drum men in the country. Possessing a technique that rivals Krupa’s in its crystal clarity, it seems to this column that his ideas are more original.

(Due to the fact that we will not be here next week, we are writing a letter to Santa Claus rather than the movie column.—Dave Vosburgh)

**Dear Santa:**
Please bring us a 200-pound fullback, two score triple-threat men, and 41 or 42 big tough linemen, so that spring practice will be a success, not to mention next fall.
Yours,
The Coaching Staff

**Dear Santa:**
Won't you please bring us a new gym for our grandchildren?
Yours,
The Student Body

**Dear Santa:**
Please make the cops from Davidson to Lynchburg quit givingus those little speed tickets. We want the right of way. - Yours Song Of The Sirens

Letters To Santa By DAVID VOSBURGH

Please bring me some good paper - WELLES L and LOUIS HITE

and striking than those of “Jungle Gene”—plus the fact that McKinley is somebody's gift to the brass section. While other drummers are pounding away at just keeping good steady time, McKinley is backing the brass on every lick they play and thus adding immeasurably to the lift of the band. Pianist Freddie Stack, in arrangements and fumbling around with various boogie-woogie passages, is playing more piano than any heart lately. With the really terrific clarinet and trumpet take-off men in the band, solo ideas are pretty well taken care of. One thing especially this band has is collective “push.” Everyone in it is working all the time; there's a bite to the ensemble passages that makes them much more interesting than they ordinarily would be. Bradley and his band are now playing at the Biltmore Ballroom. This spot has always been noted for its partiality toward “sweet” bands and his current arrangement of “Danny Boy” has had them begging for more. Some of Bradley's more recent recordings are: “Beat Me Daddy,” “Celery Stalks at Midnight,” “Scrub Me Mama,” “There I Go,” and “Down the Road a Piece.” “Beat Me Daddy” has been a best-seller for 14 weeks and is still climbing. It is No. 2 among call records now.

Those of you who read this column in the last issue of this paper undoubtedly noticed the large number of errors and fallacies in sentence structure. When an editor does not take the few minutes necessary to proofread a hastily written column, it is high time he put at the top of the list of most ONION Men of CANA. That's what he's here for. To this spirit, I now lift, Dale!!! T.AUSTERD *7t%er* (Stars denote his high degree on list.)

Several weeks ago Cauble offered some of the reasons for placing 2 I> chances greatly against your having a copy of Nov. 7th. I shall cite why he is put on the “mental scroll.” He BILL LEMMON Tis Taree sr thet DAY’S DIARY BY for the S.P.F. dance last Sat. The two girls, living next door to each other, got together and compared the flattering invitations and decided that they would both come down. (He told one something he had not told the other.) He got on the wire upon finding his precarious state of affairs and attempted to ditch one Sybyl, so I'm told, but she very graciously declined this and wired back to meet them both at the bus station. However, Shirley, being the most powerful physically, won the test and got here to enjoy the weekend. A Zeli suay-onto San.:? Ben Pit) Moore opened his year of dealing by whipping down to Spartanburg Tue. We not only ween the proofreader to omit the correcting of this column but he also encouraged him to insert as many as five or six of the worst errors in the “Diary.” The note at the head of the article was written, not to be published, but as a personal message to Andy. Just one of three words before noting the dope gathered in the last roundup. The time required to attend to last-minute details before leaving for the all-clouds holidays is so great that I have not had an opportunity to get off my apology to a Miss at Salem. Comes word that she has been affronted by a mild slice printed in this column some weeks ago. It has caused friction between all the camps and herself. As were soon, I am forced to admit that the story was a little stretched to cover more space. I hope the negotiations will be resumed immediately and will not be long in reaching their former status and rather tranquil state! The “Diary” is in a profound state of sorrow at having caused any disjunction in the working of Cupid’s arts. Roy Blue holding two found himself from Hickory Hollow dates.

ON GOING HOME: A discussion of the subterfuges employed by collegians to explain to their lady the causes for not having written and various home-town loves to excuse their neglect in not having solicited their attendance at the dances.

Dear Santa: There are a good many means of reinstatement open to the collegian who would re-enter the good graces of his neglected girl for the Yuletide season at home. Please return my old running mate, Simon, at guard. He may spring the obvious excuse that he has been pressed for time. However, if his girl is further advanced than the eighth grade, probably she will not swallow this one. Let us pass on to the more subtle excuse that he had forgotten her address. This one is most effective with eighth-graders also and is not under any conditions to be offered to any damsel having a tenth-grade education or the equivalent. It is certainly not one of the best, except in certain isolated cases. He might, however, receive a sympathetic gleam if he had heard she moved out of town. This can even be used with impunity on girls of more advanced scholastic ranking. Any enterprising young man may assume the semi-offensive, on the other hand, and declaim at length on the unreliability of the postal service. He may thus pass the buck on to the government or actually pin the blame on the Postal Service.

Dear Santa: Please give me the other half of Jack Wood's for my present, so that I might own it all. Yours, Owen Lucas.

Dear Santa: Please get that new hair tonic in for me by Christmas so that I might not catch cold. Yours, McDuffie.

Dear Santa: Please let me grow taller than Keyhole or Enoch. Yours, Abels.

Dear Santa: Please bring us more punishment by the Court of Control, because we believe that they are afraid of us. Yours, The Freshman Class.

Dear Santa: Please bring me a big, comfortable couch on which I can spend the night. P.S.: Also a trophy case. Yours, Pop Rogers.
