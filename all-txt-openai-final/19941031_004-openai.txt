Refrigerator in Union
replaces Cafe as
weekend food option

By Matthew Eirich

It’s a quarter to nine on a Friday night, and you have the munchies. You don’t have wheels to get into Cornelius, or you don’t want to deal with the messy Friday evening traffic. Your search for sustenance in your room comes up empty. The situation looks bleak. What can you do? Simple: raid the fridge in the Union.

Responding to this exact situation, the SGA and the Union Cafe have established a small “refrigerator” where students can buy snack items such as sandwiches, juices, danishes, muffins, and candy, according to Union Cafe Manager Julie Mills.

The SGA was concerned that students had no place to buy food on campus between the time the Cafe closes at seven and the Outpost opens at ten. Now, students can purchase snack items from the cooler located in front of the Union desk. Students cannot use their Cat cards to make purchases from the cooler.

The need for the cooler arose, Mills explains, because it is “very hard to find students willing to work late” on Friday and Saturday nights. This forced the Cafe to close and left students without a place to eat.

The Union Cafe first brought out the cooler two weeks ago. “Business was pretty slow the first weekend, but much more business came out of it the second weekend,” says Mills. Mills is looking for more business in the future.

The Union Cafe may establish a larger cooler if warranted by student demand.
