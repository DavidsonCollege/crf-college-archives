The Connells performed at Richardson Field during Spring Frolics.

**Frolicking with The Connells**

By VIRGINIA MISCHEN

The forecasters predicted 30 degrees, but the crowd of approximately one thousand found on the football field last Saturday night didn’t let the temperature stop them. They danced the chills away to the sound of the Connells anyway.

For about 90 minutes, the Connells played the rollicking music which has popularized them among college students in the Southeast and which has brought them national acclaim.

They started out with the title cut to *Fun & Games* and went on to play music from their other two albums—*Boylan Heights* and *Darker Days*—as well. Tunes included “Uninspired,” “I Suppose,” “Choose a Side,” and “Home Today,” as well as crowd favorites “Saturday Nite (USA)” and “Upside Down.”

“Fun!” appeared to be the general consensus from the crowd. Many students clustered near the stage, dancing and singing along. Other people took a more mellow route, bundling up in blankets and enjoying the free coffee provided by the Union.

If “fun and games” weren’t enough, people also had the opportunity to exercise their social consciences by buying one of the band’s t-shirts supporting Habitat for Humanity.

When the group attempted to conclude their performance, no one would let them. Audience enthusiasm convinced them to play two encore sets of three songs each. After all, how could they have ended without playing “Scotty’s Lament” and “Elegance”?

The Connells were brought to Davidson through the efforts of the Concert Committee and the Union as part of the annual Spring Frolics celebration. Few people could deny that it was a huge success.

For those of you who missed the concert or want to hear more, the word from Mike Connell’s mouth is that the group will record a new album next month.

**Annual Student Exhibition an Enlightening Experience...**

By JENNIFER SIECK

Did you attend a performance of *Hedda Gabler*, catch Saffire - the Uppity Blues Women, or experience the Davidson Dance troupe? Another area in the fine arts is having a show on campus, but this time it is the visual arts that are receiving attention. The Annual Student Exhibition of artwork is on display now in the Chambers Gallery. The exhibition features artwork selected from all of the 1989-90 studio art courses at Davidson. These are works which vary from a few inches in size to those a few feet in size, works done both in black and white and in color, and works representing the mediums of acrylic, oil, charcoal, oil crayon, and pencil as well as all of the techniques of lithography and etching. Their subject matters range from people to places to plants to planets to the abstract.

Susan Grosse, owner of Grosse Gallery in Charlotte, served as the awards juror for the exhibition. The first award went to Christopher Jones (etching), the second award to Mark Barrow (acrylic), and the third award to Sigrid Cook (lithograph). The three persons receiving honorable mention were Marya Howell (etching), J.B. Bean (acrylic), and Briggs Holmes (etching).

I am no art critic, having no formal and little informal training in the area of art; however, a source who chose to remain anonymous gave me a few tips: My source suggested that the students’ works were judged for quality in execution in the particular medium which was used and for subject matter. The degree of difficulty of the medium or technique may have also been taken into consideration; for example, etching is generally considered to be a very challenging technique with a high degree of difficulty. These ideas could have factored into the decisions made about the pieces.

A couple of pieces which especially caught my eye were an etching of alligators side by side done by Marya Howell and an acrylic painting of coats of many colors - rich fuchsia, purple, royal blue, and green colors done by Mollie Harrington.

I enjoyed the entire exhibition very much, and I highly recommend that you go check it out for yourself. You can feast your eyes and your imagination when looking at these students’ works. You might even take along an art student if you are a novice like myself to help you interpret what you see.

**Scandinavian and Northern European Beer: "Where the Women Are Hot, and the Beer is Not"**

By JOHN HUTCHINSON

Researching this column was particularly exciting as guest drinker Prof. Gill Holland arranged for his Norwegian in-laws to join us. Airline captain Jonny Skaar, his wife Inger Lise, and their son Bjorn flew in from Norway to spend a few days in Davidson, and generously offered their expert opinions on Scandinavian brews.

If Finland is any indication, beer production in Scandinavia and Germany is very similar, as Finnish exchange student Camilla Makinen relates that various towns brew their own special beers. Finnish cookbooks, in fact, often include beer recipes.

Jonny Skaar found the idea of a beer column rather intriguing, and asked “Do you do this for a living?” I only wish...

*Carlsberg: Dry, bitter aftertaste. “The flavor is more rich than Coors or other American beers” - Bjorn. “I would not put much volume of this into myself” — Jonny. “This is the kind of beer you drink at 11:00 am in a short glass. It has a nice ozone taste” -- Holland.

*Grolsch: Nutty or plum taste. “This is an after-dinner beer” -- Hol-
