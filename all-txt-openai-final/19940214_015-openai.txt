Women's tennis hangs tough, takes 6th place in invitational
By David Dwyer

When the Eck Sports Pavilion opened on the campus of the University of Notre Dame some years ago, the inaugural event to be hosted there was a twelve-team women’s doubles tournament. The women’s tennis teams from twelve universities were invited to enter one doubles pair in each of four ranked flights. Noting the success the tournament achieved over the years, Davidson women’s tennis coach Caroline Price decided to copy the Notre Dame format and establish a similar tourney in the Knobloch Tennis Center.

Over the past weekend, the fifth annual Davidson Women’s Doubles Tournament was held, with a total of eight regional teams in competition. Entering this year’s field were Davidson, UNC-Charlotte, Virginia Tech, James Madison, N.C. State, Winthrop, Louisville, and the University of West Virginia. The field was split into two brackets, and each played the three members of their bracket. On Sunday, the top teams from each bracket played for first, the second-ranked teams played for third, the thirds for fifth, and so on.

Davidson was grouped with JMU, WVU, and NCSU, and played West Virginia first. Because West Virginia only entered three pairs against Davidson’s four, an NCSU pair was added to play Davidson’s fourth seed. With wins in the first and third flights, Davidson defeated WVU 2-1, though the match went into the books as a 2-2 tie because the extra NCSU team defeated Davidson’s fourth pair.

Davidson lost 1-3 to both eventual champion N.C. State and JMU in their remaining bracket matches, and went into Sunday’s final pairings facing Winthrop University with fifth place at stake. Despite a strong final effort, Davidson fell to Winthrop, settling for sixth place.

“We got into a hole on the first day and had to work from there,” commented Coach Price. “We recovered nicely with a strong match against Winthrop, but it was just a matter of execution. Kim Nance and Cindy Hess (the #2 seed) played their best doubles of the year, but lost. We had some opportunities, but just missed them.”

It was, despite the outcome, a solid effort by the Davidson players, the type that could result in a victory over N.C. State this Saturday.

Sailing team finishes 2nd to #5 College of Charleston in regatta

The Davidson College Sailing Team went to Clemson for the first North Points qualifying regatta of the season. In addition to Davidson, participants included The Citadel, Clemson, Savannah College of Art and Design, and College of Charleston, whose team is currently ranked fifth in the nation. At Clemson, the temperature was in the thirties, but the crew got off six races for each division in a rather light breeze. Competing for Davidson were junior David Saudek, sophomore Francis Bailey, freshwoman Heather Raddin, and freshwoman Lara Burkholder.

Saturday, women's track travelled to compete at Virginia Tech. The first event was the 5000m, where freshman Stephanie Moses placed 1st with the time of 19:43. Maria Whitehead placed 5th in the triple jump.

Lara Burkholder blazed in the 55m, earning a spot in the semi-finals, running a 7.73. In the shot put arena, sophomore Erica Gomelski threw 27’6". In her first time running the 1000m, Phuong Nguyen ran a strong 3:15 to place fourth. Next week the team travels to ETSU for the Southern Conference Indoor track meet.EXCELLENT Free Details: SASE to International Inc. 1375 Coney Island Ave. Brooklyn, New York 11230

Sophomore Andrew Cole. The team’s finishes in A division were 3, 3, 14, 3, 3 and in B division Davidson finished 3, 2, 2, 1, 4, 3. These finishes were good enough for second in each division and second overall, close behind the College of Charleston, which finished first in A and third in B. The low point overall scores were: Charleston 26, Davidson 32, The Citadel 35, Clemson 37, Savannah 51. The second place finish puts Davidson well above the cut for the South Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Association championships this spring. The top four teams from North and South points qualify to race at the University of Florida this spring, and the top two teams at the championship go to the Intercollegiate Yacht Racing Association National Championships to race for the national title. Charleston is perpetually one of the two teams which goes to nationals, but the second spot is up for grabs this year. The next North Points regatta is here at Davidson on March 12 and 13. We will sail at the lake campus, so please come out and support the team.
