**Student Government Association Grants F.L.A.G. Charter**  
By Walter Price

The Student Government Association voted Tuesday, November 12 to grant an SGA charter to Friends of Lesbians and Gays (F.L.A.G.). The charter passed the SGA Senate with 28 officers or senators voting “yes”, 1 voting “no”, and 3 abstentions. Representatives from F.L.A.G., who attended the Senate vote were satisfied with the outcome. “I am extremely pleased with the outcome and with the acceptance and understanding that this campus has shown,” Jennifer Williams, F.L.A.G. co-chair said.

For the group, their next step involves the procuring of funds through the Activities Tax Council, to be approved by the Senate, according to Williams. “Although we can technically support ourselves, we need financial support to pay for membership and publicity fees,” Williams said. In addition, Williams said the group wanted to begin to further educate the Davidson campus about homosexuality through speakers and open forums.

The Senate discussion of the proposed charter began with Lee Hamrick’s recommendation from the Charter and Bylaws Committee that F.L.A.G be granted a charter, although Hamrick noted that the committee’s decision was not unanimous. “I’ve felt and others have felt torn over the issue of granting a charter. We do not approve of the harassment and discrimination faced by many students. For this reason, we hesitate to vote against the story above for details.

**Renovations Begun On Carnegie Guest House**  
By John Murchison

Renovations to the Carnegie Guest House are under way and should be completed by the first week in January, according to Carlton Pritchard, director of auxiliary services. The renovations, which were originally expected to be completed by the end of November, are under the direction of E. Morrison Brown, an interior designer from Charlotte. Brown, who is a Davidson alumnus, also directed the renovations to the Grey House this past summer.

Plans for the renovations include the conversion of the office into a parlor, a library, and a television room. The parlor will be named the Marcia Bell Mitchell Parlor, in honor of the daughter of Davidson alumnus Samuel Bell. Mitchell’s bequest to the college in 1962 was the largest single contribution to the college at the time. In addition to the office conversion, the guest house is receiving other improvements as well. The kitchen will receive a new entrance and a wet bar, the living room will have new molding and a false door to add balance, and embellishments are being added to three arches in the downstairs hallway. Cosmetically, the guest house will receive fresh paint, new carpet, curtains, furniture and refinished floors. All eight guest rooms...

This is some of the feeling expressed within the committee,” Hamrick said. Hamrick’s report was followed by F.L.A.G.’s presentation of their proposed charter, which outlined their purposes in forming this group. Included in this purpose were: to protect the rights of lesbians and gays, to further understanding about homosexuality, to provide support for the gay community, to educate the public about AIDS, to promote equal rights for all, and finally, to combat homophobia.

Following the proposed charter’s presentation, discussion began amongst the Senate on approval of the F.L.A.G. group. SGA President Cammie Covington stressed that the Senate was voting solely on the group’s charter. “We are not discussing the money issue at this time. The ATC determines..."

DCTV To Broadcast On Cable

By Tom Koonce

What first started out as a video study break every other week has now turned into a closed circuit 24-hour a day television station to be broadcast across campus on Channel 14 through any television set hooked up to cable. This station will make its premiere on Monday, November 8, and will broadcast continuously from that time. The purpose of this channel, as stated in its policy guidelines, is to “provide a means to inform the college campus about special events and activities in an accessible manner and on a continuing basis.” According to Station Manager Lesley Vauclain, the channel will air a wide range of programming including college-wide events such as theatrical productions and music recitals or concerts; Union-sponsored events; academic events such as speakers; and events sponsored by other student organizations such as YSSC and the SGA. The sponsoring organization must get written permission from the performer or speaker to air the event on the station. The channel will also broadcast away athletic events. At first, this will be done from sports programming tapes but Vauclain be...
