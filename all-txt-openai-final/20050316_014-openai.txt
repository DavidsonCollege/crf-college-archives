Historic season ends in conference semis

By STEPHEN J. HALLIDAY

With a 17-10 record (14-6 SoCon), the women’s basketball team headed into the conference tournament in Chattanooga, TN, as the
second seed behind powerhouse UT-Chattanooga. The ’Cats’ first game was in the quarterfinals against the seven seed, College of Charleston.
The game started slowly, as the ’Cats played solid defense but failed to hit their shots and turned the ball
over frequently. Davidson shot just 30 percent from the floor in the period but held Charleston to an abysmal 23
percent. A Katie Hamilton ’07 three at the end of the half put the ’Cats up 20-14 going into the
intermission.

In the second half, however, the ’Cats caught fire. Hamilton, who scored 22 points in the second period alone, led
the offensive barrage for Davidson, and the combination of offensive and defensive efficiency allowed the ’Cats to jump out to
a quick lead and cruise to a 68-48 win. Hamilton finished the game with 27 points and six rebounds, and
guard Tia Washington ’07 added 14 points and eight rebounds. Captain Emily Callahan ’05 said of the play of Hamilton
and Washington, “[Hamilton] has been a great leader through her play, and [Washington] has been great at telling us what
to do, motivating us, and has done a terrific job the entire season of what needs to be done on
the floor.”

With the win, Davidson advanced to the tournament semifinals against Western Carolina. Just as importantly, top seed and conference bully
Chattanooga fell in the opposite side of the bracket against ETSU, meaning the field was wide open for Davidson to
make a run at the SoCon title. Davidson had mixed results against Western earlier in the year, however, as the
’Cats were drilled in Cullowhee, 74-56, before they pulled out a tense 65-63 win at home on two last-second Jessica
Mitchell ’07 free throws. The Catamounts, led by all-conference center Jennifer Gardner, again proved a very tough match-up for the
’Cats, as their size under the glass routinely led to offensive rebounds, second-chance points, and defensive pressure.

Davidson struggled to solve Western’s size early in the semifinal game, as the ’Cats hobbled to a seven-point deficit at
intermission after the Catamounts pulled down 13 offensive rebounds that led to 13 second-chance points in the first frame. Western
registered only four more offensive rebounds in the second half, and the Wildcats chipped away at the deficit despite hitting
on just 35 percent of their attempts in the final frame. A three-pointer by Danielle Hemerka ’08 less than 10
minutes into the second frame put the Wildcats up 42-41, their first lead since the opening minutes, and a Washington
layup with 3:38 to play put Davidson up 53-48. With Hamilton and Janell Crayton ’06 in foul trouble, however, the
’Cats turned the ball over several times in the final minutes and failed to convert from the field and at
the line as Western jumped back out to a 56-53 lead with under a minute to play. A game-tying try
from beyond the arc by Hamilton was no good, and Western then iced the victory by going 3-4 from the
line in the final minute. Mitchell hit a three from nearly 40 feet as time expired, but the ’Cats fell
just short in the 59-58 loss.

Crayton led the team in scoring with 14 points, while Hemerka added 10 points and seven boards. Hamilton and Washington
struggled from the field, going a combined 5-21 and scoring nine and seven points, respectively. Despite the loss, the ’Cats’
season was an undeniable success, as Davidson set a school record for conference wins and earned the second seed in
the SoCon tournament for only the second time in school history.the second time in school history. The team is losing
only one senior, Callahan, and though her leadership will certainly be missed, the team will return to the hardwood with
high expectations next November.

UNCG did not back down, however, as the Spartans used clutch shooting from the free-throw line to pull back out
to a three-point lead with 1:31 to go. McKillop, after the game, suggested that UNCG’s constant trips to the line
in the closing minutes may have also caused Davidson to tighten up, as each free throw opportunity stopped the clock
and forced Davidson players to begin to think instead of just play. The ’Cats came back to tie the game
on a Winters reverse lay-up with a minute to play, but UNCG responded with a three-pointer to put the ’Cats
down three yet again. Two Logan Kosmalski ’05 free throws on the ensuing possession cut the lead to one, but
the Spartans hit another jumper that put the ’Cats out for good. Kosmalski’s game-tying attempt from beyond the arc was
short, ending Davidson’s hopes of a storybook postseason run. Instead, the best team in the Southern Conference all year had
to go home because it failed in the one game that actually mattered.

In a recent interview on ESPN’s College GameNight, Coach McKillop explained, “We came into the tournament knowing the rules of
engagement. It’s a game of Russian roulette.” But is it a necessary game of roulette? While the common notion is
that mid-majors must win their tournaments to advance to the Big Dance, the Ivy League does not have a conference
tournament, and therefore the regular season champion receives the automatic NCAA bid. This places a premium on sustained success instead
of the bounces of the basketball in early March and allows the conference to send its best representative instead of
the team on a small winning streak. Perhaps the rising stock of mid-majors around the country will put pressure on
conferences to create a better way to select their conference representative, but the 2004-05 Wildcats will have to be content
with a perfect regular season, an NIT appearance, and a place in the annals of March Madness.
