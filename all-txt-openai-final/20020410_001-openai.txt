**Lottery controversy brings RLO policies into question**  
**Marsicano: RLO uses more than lottery numbers in determining housing**

A recent controversy over Martin Court Apartment assignments has drawn the objectivity of the housing lottery into question. According to Dean of Residence Life Leslie Marsicano, the controversy arose because of housing assignments for Flowe, one of the senior apartments. Of the groups who applied for Flowe 302, the group with the highest, least desirable numbers was given the apartment.

Juniors Kevin Epps said he and Hank Bahr, Will McMurray, and Tom Boyle applied for Flowe 302. The group investigated and found their numbers were in fact better than those of the students who had been placed in their desired apartment. The group was placed in B apartment, one of their last choices. Epps met with Dean Marsicano to seek answers. “It didn’t seem fair to me that our lottery numbers were not observed,” he said.

Marsicano explained that, when Epps’s group came up in the lottery, there were already students living on the second floor of Flowe who had expressed a desire for a quiet atmosphere. Epps’s group included several members of Phi Delta Theta fraternity. “Ever since the national chapter of Phi Delta Theta mandated that the fraternity house go dry, apartments with lots of Phi Delts tend to be very social places,” she said. “We felt that placing these groups together would be asking for unhappiness.”

It has been RLO’s standard procedure ever since Martin Court was built to take into account considerations besides lottery numbers when assigning apartments, Marsicano said.

**Campus, town police join to battle spate of car break-ins**  
**School will build fence on one side of satellite parking lot to ward off thieves**

After a series of Fall 2001 car break-ins came and went, it seemed a temporary crime wave had been resolved. Unfortunately, five larceny incidents within a span of two days have alerted the community to the fact that crime is still a very real concern, even in a place as “safe” as Davidson.

According to the Office of Public Safety, the five car break-ins all took place on either March 23 or March 24. Three of the incidents took place in satellite; one occurred on Martin Court (the senior apartments); and one occurred in senior satellite parking (near the greenhouse). Four of these cars had items removed from them. The stolen items included CDs, car stereos, and a cell phone.

College President Bobby Vagt says that the Office of Public Safety is coordinating its anti-burglary efforts with local police. “North Charlotte, Huntersville, and the Lake Norman area have all been beset by CD equipment thefts,” he explained. Vagt said the police have a lead on where the stolen parts are being sold but was unaware of any suspects.

Even given the fact that the Davidson larcenies fit into a larger pattern of thefts, Vagt admits that the incidents are troubling. “We are, normally, relatively free from that kind of concern.” Besides cooperating with local police, the school is using unmarked vehicles to monitor high-risk parking areas. Vagt said that a fence will be placed along the west side of satellite, and that the school is also investigating the possibility of installing security cameras.

**Popular Charlotte-area restaurant will open in June with food and bar**  
**By Nick ASMA**

Two months from now, a new restaurant plans to open in the Davidson Depot, which will once again attract students and locals by featuring both food service and a bar. The restaurant, Showmars Brickhouse, will be based around the Charlotte area chain, Showmar’s, but will offer an expanded menu and other new features.

Showmars currently has 17 locations in Charlotte, Monroe, Rock Hill, and the surrounding areas. The chain fills the void between fast food restaurant and a formal, full-service restaurant. Though the new restaurant will not be a direct copy of the existing Showmars locations, it will maintain the same quality and service that the chain is known for.Possibility of installing security cameras in the parking lots. Identical to the existing Showmar’s, it will share many features with the already popular chain. According to George Couchell, president of Showmars, the restaurant will offer a full menu with reasonably priced meals. Lunch specials will average around $6.95, and dinner will cost anywhere from $7.95 to $15.95. The menu is still in the planning stages, but Couchell says it will offer burgers, pitas, lamb and vegetarian gyros, meat tips, and flounder. Showmars markets its filet of flounder platters as the “World’s Best.” By incorporating items from Showmars into the menu, said Couchell, the food will be of restaurant quality at good prices, and will be offered in carry-out as well. The menu will also include appetizers for the bar and pizza baked in brick ovens in the lobby area.

“We try to avoid problems up-front... We think taking into account the good of the community is very important,” she said. College president Bobby Vagt agreed that nothing out of the ordinary or “illegal” had been done with regard to this year’s housing assignments. “Everything was done according to established procedure,” he said. Epps worries that this procedure has not been fully explained to students. “I fear that there are people out there with low numbers who deserve better rooms and don’t know it,” he said. “It took a lot of work for us to find out that our real numbers were not used. Most students are not going to take the time to do that.” Marsicano admitted that RLO needs to do a better job of educating students about the policy. “What this year has taught us is that we have not been clear enough about the factors involved in assigning apartments. We need to be clearer next year,” she said, adding that the RLO website does not explicitly state that factors besides lottery numbers may be taken into consideration.

Epps went on to say that he felt the problem lies not only in the lack of communication of policy, but the policy itself. “The policy has a lot of room for error. If you’re going to have a lottery, have a lottery. Rearranging housing beyond the numbers seems wrong to me. It is not the Davidson community way. Davidson is about different students from different backgrounds coming together and living together. Conflict is a part of life, and I don’t think it’s right that a group of adults are deciding what conflicts will arise.” Marsicano says RLO is working with Epps and his roommates to reach a mutually acceptable solution.

Showmars to move into old Depot building
The new owners also plan to keep the bar, which is currently being rebuilt (including a complete floor replacement). In an effort to offer more than the previous bar, it will feature designer beers, drafts, and more liquor selections. The emphasis will still be on beer, as opposed to hard liquor or mixed drinks. The bar will again offer theme nights like those at the previous Depot, in order to attract college students and local residents. Plans also include a band on Friday and Saturday nights. The current stage platform will be redesigned into a private room for social functions. Couchell felt that by using the name Showmars in the restaurant’s title, he will attract those already familiar with the local chain. He felt the old Depot offered a unique location in North Mecklenburg, the region’s fastest-growing area, not to mention the only bar in a college town.
