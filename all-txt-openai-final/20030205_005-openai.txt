Give me a (spring) break | By Lucy Long, Staff Writer

With only 24 days and counting until spring break, it's time to start planning! Whether you are looking for a
tan, powder snow, or international culture, we’ve got you covered. Check out these destinations as inspiration for organizing your own
spring break.

FOR SUN
Try: Freeport, Bahamas
Price: $299-$499 per person based on hotel selection
Includes: Cruise from Ft. Lauderdale to Freeport; 5 nights hotel (quadruple occupancy); roundtrip transfers to the ship; lunch and dinner
each day; party package
The catch: lunch consists of hot dogs; dinner consists of pizza...for five days straight. Enough said. Yet your biggest effort
of the day will be applying sunscreen and reaching over for your drink as you admire the white sand beaches
and all the other scantily-clad college students.
Words of wisdom: pack your own lunch. Too much pig intestine isn’t a good thing.
How? springbreaktravel.com (for the trip above), studentadvtravel.com, ststravel.com for trips to Mexico, Bahamas, Florida, and Jamaica.

FOR SNOW
Try: Breckenridge, Colorado
Price: $470-$800 per person based on accommodations
Includes: 6 nights in a 2 bedroom condominium in town (quadruple occupancy); 5 day lift pass accessible to Breckenridge, Vail,
Keystone, Arapahoe Basin, and Beaver Creek; and for an alpine ski sport package for 5 days add $100.
The catch: estimated driving time is 24 hours. Unless you can tape everyone’s mouth shut, things can get a little
hairy while trapped in an enclosed vehicle for extended periods of time. Don’t forget that road trips can be fun,
too. We're college kids with the gift of stamina and lots of practice pulling all-nighters and living off caffeine; so
make the trip while you still can. Your future children will think you were cool.
Words of wisdom: skip Kansas, and thank me later.
How? breckenridge.com (for the trip above), coloradotrips.com; ski.com for trips all over the US.

FOR CULTURE
Try: Madrid, Spain
Price: $450-$550
Includes: roundtrip airfare from Charlotte ($350 on US Airways); 6 nights stay at a youth hostel (based on double occupancy).
The catch: you have to travel on weekdays only for this airfare. However, Madrid’s energy and history should be enough
incentive to make the trip to Europe. This truly is the city that never sleeps. With wild nightlife lasting well
into the morning, the city virtually shuts down every afternoon for the coveted siesta. The best part? Daily living and
activities in Spain are dirt cheap, so you don’t have to worry about going over your estimated budget once you
get there.
Words of wisdom: salmonella, salmonella, salmonella. Spending a week over the toilet isn’t fun for anyone, so avoid tap water,
uncooked meat, and runny eggs.
How? usairways.com and letsgo.com (for the trip above); travelinginspain.com, and aboutmadrid.com for general travel information.

These are just a few examples of affordable trips that are easily planned. As always, Davidson Outdoors has some great
options for cheap thrills under the stars. This year’s all-inclusive spring break trips include: canoeing through theEverglades for $200 and
backpacking on Cumberland Island for $85. Happy traveling!

~~ Sardonic Irreverence: Part I ~~

With a nod, but just a small one, to the C.M.A. Index of Libertas, we at Arts & Living introduce
our new feature, “Sardonic Irreverence.” With our fingers on the pulse of Cool, we give you a weekly update of
what’s in and what’s out. Also, we love suggestions, so e-mail Derek Loh (deloh@davidson.edu) or Chris Schmader (chschmader@davidson.edu) with what
you think is cool... or not cool. Warning: If you send us something that you think is cool, but it
really isn’t cool, your suggestion may be placed in the “Not Cool” section. So get those suggestions to us PDQ!

**COOL**

Justin Timberlake (JT): “Cry Me a River.” Doing it with a hot, olive-skinned lady on Britney’s bed? What about filming
it? Best pop-song music video since “Can’t Get You Out of My Head.”

Kim Jong Il: Of the rotating ethnic villains du jour, he has the best hair and sunglasses.

Hans Blix: Not since Boutros-Boutros Ghali has a name so cool been associated with the U.N.

T.A.T.U.: Lesbian Russian schoolgirls with a catchy chorus. And you'll never see people having a T.A.T.U. dance-off a la “Ketchup
Song.”

Affirmative action: Whether you love it or hate it, or just don’t want to be affected by it, this policy
is here to stay. Might as well get used to it.

**Not Cool**

Seven Jeans: More ubiquitous at Davidson than ponies in Lord of the Rings: Two Towers. Neigh to that, ladies.

WaHo at Exit 28: Sure, it was cool when it first opened. We didn’t have to go far for some
smothered or covered. But with its antiseptically white walls and no-smoking policy, it just doesn’t feel like the real thing.

MoJo: On last week’s “Joe Millionaire,” MoJo gave Evan a jigsaw puzzle of herself and Jigglypuff have hired a lawyer
and plan to sue MoJo for copyright infringement.

My Big Fat Greek Wedding: You’d think that $100 million and a few Golden Globe nominations would have been enough.
But no. Now there’s a television show on the horizon. How unbelievable is that?

That song by Sheryl Crow and Kid Rock: Kid Rock is awful. Period.

**Yet to be scheduled**

Justin Timberlake/Christina Aguilera tour: Rows 1-10 will complain of STDs contracted during the “Dirty” encore. But who will care? They
bought tickets to the concert, right?

Check back next week for another installment. And send us your responses!
