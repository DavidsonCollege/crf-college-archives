Now there's a course that pays $100 a month.

Army ROTC.

In our Advanced Course, the monthly subsistence allowance has just been increased from $50 to $100. One hundred dollars every month for 10 months of the school year. To spend on room and board, dates, and ball games. To save for grad school.

But Army ROTC means a lot more than more money. It means management and leadership experience that you just canâ€™t get anywhere else. The kind of thing that can land you a better job and move you along faster once you get it. It means a commission as an officer and everything that goes with it. The prestige, the pay, the chance to travel, the experience.

Now ROTC looks even better. For the money you'll earn today. For the person you'll be tomorrow. See your Professor of Military Science, or send the coupon for information.
