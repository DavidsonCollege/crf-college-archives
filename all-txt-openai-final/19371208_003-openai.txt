Humor Magazine | The Old and the New Appear Next Week | Christmas Issue of Scripts ‘n Pranks Will Have
New Features

Hog Caller

The editorial staff of Scripts ‘n Pranks has announced that the second issue of the campus humor publication, devoted to
a Christmas theme, will appear about the 4th of this month. The magazine’s cover design will be a snow scene
expressing the Christmas spirit that pervades the campus. This scene will be artistically done in colors of blue and white.

The main feature of this issue will be a portrait section and a snapshot section. There will also be a
section devoted to campus styles, depicting what the smart young woman about the campus should wear, featured by B.B. Smith's
“Hog-calling contest” at the banquet. The publication will feature some new names.

Mrs. Pfohl, Riker Give Concert

Mr. Franklin Riker will give a very interesting concert titled “Photograph,” a coonskin coat, we've heard it said, wards off
chill winds from heel to head. In which respect its chief vocation is much like No Draft Ventilation’s.

For this semester in the Philanthropic Literary Society Hall, Thursday evening at 8 P.M., Dick Vowles and Walter Heilman will
collaborate on a column of musical notes. Beginning promptly, the concert will not be delayed. Admission is free and the
general public is invited.

The Fall Frolics are over but the student body is not satisfied with the title of these dances. So many
are circulating around that seem to fit better than the one chosen that possibly the name will have to be
changed. Rut Miller was heard to call it “Heifer Highballs” and “Cow Cocktails.” Fred Smith expressed his opinion by calling
it “No Draft Ventilation.”

Mr. Riker, a teacher of voice here, began his career as a boy soloist at Old Trinity Church, New York
City. During this time, he attended the University of Vermont and later returned to New York to continue his studies.
