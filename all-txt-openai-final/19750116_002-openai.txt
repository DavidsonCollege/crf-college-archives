The Martin Chemistry building contains rooms which do not meet federal safety regulations, according to Director of the Physical Plant
Grover C. Meetze Jr.

“The Martin building, which was first occupied in 1940, has labs that do not have necessary exhaust hoods. Acids and
reactive chemicals are stored in rooms that were not built for that purpose,” said Chemistry Department Chairman Nicholas Burnett.

“There is no question that we are deficient in these areas,” he said. Burnett added that the space in the
Martin building is inefficiently used. The building contains classrooms with pipes running across ceilings, poor lighting, and inadequate acoustics.

All colleges and companies today are in some way violating federal safety laws, according to Meetze.

College President Samuel R. Spencer Jr. indicated that he did not know of any federal safety requirements that had not
been met in the chemistry building.

“If the worn out, poorly ventilated building cannot be renovated, we ought to look into it right away,” Spencer said.

On February 2, 1973, Burnett submitted a report to Spencer which cited the problems of poorly ventilated and worn-out labs.
Burnett has guided Spencer through the Martin building, pointing out its deficiencies.

The problems involved in renovating Martin or in constructing a new chemistry building are not new ones. Burnett and Meetze
have been occupied with them for six years.

“Nobody has worked harder than I to get a new or renovated chemistry building over the past few years. All
my drawings will vouch for that,” said Meetze.

“We have made a strong effort to increase safety by requiring safety glasses, installing eyewashes, safety showers, and fireproof blankets,”
said Burnett.

“We have had two inspections by our insurance people. We have passed both inspections,” remarked Meetze.

The report submitted to Spencer on February 2, 1973, by Burnett stated, “We have spent the last four years studying
the possible ways to improve the laboratory facilities by renovation of the Martin building, or by construction of a new
building.

“In my opinion, additional time and effort devoted to deliberations on the questions would not be productive.

“Frankly, we have reached a point of diminishing return. The time for a clear decision is at hand.”

“I recommend the decision to renovate the Martin building for use by the chemistry department,” remarked Burnett.

Meetze argued that the building situation should be re-evaluated in light of the present economic considerations.

The administration applied for a Seely G. Mudd Foundation grant and for National Science Foundation money. Both applications were rejected.

“One of the main problems in solving the Chemistry building dilemma is that the Davidson administration has never fully committed
itself to getting a new or renovated chemistry building. Until we get this commitment, I am not optimistic.

“Our hopes were raised a couple of years ago, but nothing happened. We spent a great deal of time and
effort in working out a report and little has been done,” Burnett stated.

Spencer said that he would not make the chemistry construction his number one major building priority.

“We are considering three or four projects. Chemistry is one of our top priority needs; however, a new fine arts
facility, field house, and additional housing are also under consideration.

“I have appointed a goals committee who will try to identify all things the college would like to have by
1987. We will arrange resource needs on a priority basis, and we will formulate ways to get these buildings and
resources.

“The committee will have representatives from among the trustees, the faculty, the student body, and the staff. I expect the
report of the committee to be out by May,” said Spencer.

“Whether we decide on building one structure versus another will depend largely on fundraising. We will try to identify potential
sources of money and approach these sources with our plans,” added Spencer.

“There are a sizable number of potential donors available. I think we have some very good selling points, and can
compete favorably with other institutions also seeking funds,” stated the new Vice-President for Development Craven Williams.

“The Mudd Foundation is still very much a possible source of funds. We will have to re-establish our communication with
them.”
