CHARLOTTE, N. C.

Unless the students take some concerted action, it practically amounts to penalizing the boarding house keepers who are patriotic enough
to comply with the requests of the Food Administration. The boarding house keepers themselves are more than helpless to enforce
anything like observance of the wishes of the Government unless they have the concerted co-operation of the student body.

ALUMNI NOTES

The sympathy of friends is extended to M. J. Shirley, '15, stationed at Camp Johnson, Jacksonville, Fla., in the death
of his father, R. M. Shirley, a prominent business man of Honea Path, S. C.

WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT “THE DAVIDSONIAN”

“Have only been here a short while and like the place fine. Can’t get along without The Davidsonian.”—E. Nisbet, '16,
Camp MacArthur, Waco, Texas.

“Phat dandy paper, “The Davidsonian,” which I always read from A to Z. We have been moving from camp to
camp, but will soon get settled for a while. Here’s always to D. C.”—Lex Kluttz, '15, U. S. A. Hospital
Unit 34, American Ex. Forces, Somewhere in France.

ARE YOU PATRIOTIC?

Were a Davidson man accused of being unpatriotic, he would point indignantly to the Y. M. C. A. War Fund,
to drill, to many other patriotic exercises. Were he accused of aiding the Kaiser, he would probably knock his accuser
down. And yet when it comes to a question in which the service of Davidson men is of the most
vital importance, there seem to be many who are unwilling to do their part. The conservation of food is of
the utmost importance—we all realize the truth of that statement—and still no concerted action has as yet been taken. Some
boarding houses observe “meatless and wheatless days;” others do not. Those who observe, not only have to contend with the
dissatisfaction of those of their own members who miss their daily ration of bovine condiment, but they must also compete
with the other boarding houses who have not entered upon the “Less” days.

There seems to be a general sentiment from many sources that some concerted action among the students should be taken
in regard to such an important matter. Here is an opportunity for the students to do something for the service
of their country; and it is something that must be done by the students themselves.

This is the opinion of many men on the campus, and such a sentiment seems to be growing. Within the
next few days the matter will probably be formally brought before the student body, and some action taken.
