**Tentative Plans Set For April Inauguration**

**DR. HOWARD LOWRY**

It was announced this week that D. Grier Martin, president of Davidson College, will be officially inaugurated on April 22. Mr. Martin was elected to this office on May 15, 1958, after having served as Treasurer and Business Manager of the College since 1951.

David Grier Martin, Davidson’s fourteenth president, was born on November 11, 1910, in Covington, Georgia, and was educated in the Covington public schools. He graduated from Davidson in 1932 with a B.S. in history, cum laude.

**LL.D FOR D. G. M.**

It’s “Dr. Martin” now. President D. Grier Martin was awarded an honorary LL.D. (Doctor of Laws) Wednesday morning by King College in Bristol, Tennessee. The degree was granted during a three-day mid-year academic convocation. Besides President Martin, three others, including the Rev. Paul F. Warren of Asheville, a Davidson alumnus, were given honorary doctorates.

“Part of the background of their giving me a degree,” President Martin commented, “was that I spent eleven years in business there in Bristol before coming to Davidson.”

**EDITOR**

As a student here he was editor of the DAVIDSONIAN and a member of Omicron Delta Kappa. He was also a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon social fraternity and lettered in basketball and track. He served as lieutenant in the U.S. Naval Reserve in 1944-45.

**PLANS INDEFINITE**

Although plans are still indefinite, there will probably be a concert and a reception on the night before the inauguration for students and members of the college community. The plans also call for a luncheon the following day, April 22, for the delegates from other colleges who will be here for the occasion.

The year following his graduation from Davidson, Mr. Martin was a graduate student in history at Emory University. From 1933 to 1936 he served as Alumni Secretary and Publicity Director at Davidson. From 1936 until 1940 he was a business executive with the Campbell Coal Company of Atlanta, and from 1940 until 1951 he was with Grey Hosiery Mills of Bristol, Virginia, as a partner and sales manager. Mr. Martin also served as a lieutenant in the U.S. Naval Reserve in 1944-45.

**The principal speaker at the convocation will be Dr. Howard F. Lowry, president of the College of Wooster. Dr. Lowry, who is widely recognized as a leader in the field of education, received his A.B. at the College of Wooster, and later obtained his Ph.D. from Yale University. He has taught English at the College of Wooster, Yale University, and Princeton University.**

**AUTHOR**

He is presently a member of the Board of Trustees of McCormick Theological Seminary, Western Theological Seminary, and the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. Dr. Lowry is also a member of the Board of Foreign Missions of the Presbyterian Church, U.S.A. He has written several books.

**DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N.C. FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 1959**

**Kingston Trio Signed**

**Stringing And Singing**

The Kingston Trio, famous for their hit recording of “Tom Dooley,” will appear in Chambers Auditorium on the third of March, at 8:30 p.m. Tickets will sell for $1.75 ($1.50 if bought early by students) in this IFC-sponsored concert.

**Wey Staples In Interview Discusses YMCA Ills**

“The trouble with the YMCA this year has been an administrative one, together with the lack of student interest.” These were the words of Dr. George Staples, College Chaplain and advisor of the YMCA Cabinet, in a DAVIDSONIAN interview early this week. He went on to say, “The Y has not been as tightly an organized group this year as it was last year. Its leaders, although perhaps every bit as capable as last year’s, do not have the driving force that is required for an effective organization.”

Dr. Staples added that he has worked with the Y for only three years, and he likened the situation this year to that of two years ago. In comparing and contrasting this year’s YMCA with past ones, he said that cooperation with the freshman advisor has been very good; he also stated that the Y study groups are being handled better. On the debit side of the comparison, however, he admitted that the membership and the gift fund aspects of the Y have fallen short of their usual standards.

**Officials Probe Student's Death**

Georgia law enforcement officers continued investigation this week into the death of Tom Maxwell, a 20-year-old Davidson junior. Maxwell’s body was found Saturday morning beside a railroad track near Duluth, Georgia. The Davidson student had been employed at a branch of Atlanta's First National Bank since last February. He was returning to the college by train to resume his studies this semester.

An inquest has been scheduled for February 8 in Lawrenceville, Georgia, to establish the circumstances of his death. Police are meanwhile holding Harry J. Hughes, 48, of Birmingham, Alabama, in connection with the incident.

A native of Quincy, Florida, Maxwell belonged to the class of 1960. Night school work since he left Davidson kept him up with his class. Maxwell was a member of Beta Theta Pi social fraternity and participated in several campus activities.

Staples qualified this, however, by saying that “the failure is not due to lack of organization or enthusiasm on the part of the drive chairman. This year he spent a lot of time preparing for the two drives, but for some reason, they just didn’t seem to click.”

Asked one of the DAVIDSONIAN interviewers, “Does this explicitly indicate a lack of student interest?” The reply was, “Quantitatively, yes. But I want to mention that although the membership is smaller this year than in years past, the Y has a better per capita support from its members.”

Pursuing the subject of student apathy, the question of a possible cause was put to Dr. Staples. He answered, “I can’t honestly say that the YMCA has tried as hard as it could to overcome this handicap. After all, who actually does try as hard as he can? The problem is basically this: Fields in which the Y contributed to the student body have vanished in that these functions have been taken over by other organizations.

“For instance, the Orientation program, which was originally a Y project, has been handled in recent years by the college. The Union has replaced the Y's entertainment function. I understand that a good while ago the intramurals program was run by the YMCA and now the Physical Education department has it. The YMCA is aware of this problem, and a committee has been appointed to look into other possible fields of contribution.”

Dr. Staples was asked about the connection and possible conflicts of his dual job: that of College Chaplain and YMCA advisor. He replied that the two jobs do conflict, and the ideal solution would be to have a full-time Chaplain and a full-time Y Secretary. He went on, “For a man to be an effective YMCA advisor, he needs a good orientation in the National Y. Personally, I dislike the national and regional organization of the Y. A good administrative system is lacking.

“I was hired by Dr. Cunningham to do a number of things. He assured me when I came in that if the separate jobs required too much time, the YMCA Cabinet, with its projects and organization, (Continued On Page Four)”

**Mr. Robert A. Currie, Business Manager of the college, said that the two dollar increase was necessary in order to realize a net return of approximately 5% on the College’s investment of $360,000. Mr. Currie explained that the college has a nine million dollar endowment fund which it invests in various stocks and bonds. Part of this endowment has been invested in the new fraternity court instead of in stocks and bonds. The college must realize the same net earnings from this investment as it does from the others. To receive a net of almost 5%, the rent must bring in 8% because the college will have to provide for depreciation, insurance, maintenance, and other expenses. This same arrangement applied to the older houses.**But since the initial investment was very low relative to the new court, the rent on the older Fraternity Housing Fee houses was therefore much lower. The twenty-dollar fee, originally suggested in the spring of 1957, was set as approximately the rent to be paid by each student per semester. Since the fraternity houses were not completed until shortly before rush week, the twenty-dollar rent was charged first semester until a more accurate figure could be set. Shortly before the second semester began, the cost of the Fraternity Court had not been determined, but the twenty-two dollar rent fee was printed on registration cards. The final figure for the cost of the court will be known “in a few weeks,” Mr. Currie stated. At that time plans can be made for rent for the 1959 Fall Semester, and according to Mr. Currie, “there is a possibility that the fee might be even higher than twenty-two dollars.”

Status Quo Prevails At Athletic Council Meeting

A recent attempt by the Wildcat Club to increase the number of athletic scholarships by fifteen was squelched in the January meeting of the Athletic Council. The Wildcat Club's representative on the Council read a motion, passed by the Club, requesting ten more football scholarships and five more basketball scholarships. The Athletic Council discussed the motion for some time before pointing out that such a request was entirely inconsistent with the athletic scholarship program as it stands now. Prior to the meeting, the DAVIDSONIAN asked Dr. Tom Sparrow of Charlotte, Chairman of the Athletic Council, if he knew a proposal of this sort was on the agenda. He, along with others of the Council, disclaimed all knowledge of such a move. A statement was released after the meeting that such a proposal had been made, but that its inconsistency had been pointed out to the representatives from the Wildcat Club, and that “athletic scholarships would, as before, increase proportionately with the increase of the Living Endowment Fund." The DAVIDSONIAN was denied entrance to the meeting.

Before 1954, the Wildcat Club raised all funds to be used for athletic scholarships. If the members of the Wildcat Club felt that there should be more scholarships offered, their problem was simply to raise more money. Four years ago, however, the athletic scholarship fund was combined with the general Endowment Fund of the Alumni Association, and the allotment for athletic scholarships was determined on a certain percentage of the entire fund. In that year, the scholarship awards amounted to about thirty-seven percent of the total fund, and since then, the award has been consistent with this percentage. Last year the total amount for athletic scholarships was raised by some seventeen thousand dollars, due to an increase in the general fund of the Alumni Association; there are now thirty-four football scholarships and ten basketball scholarships. The entire fund amounts to some $150,000 annually now, and is expected to rise to $200,000 by 1960.

According to a source present at the meeting, the discussion of the Wildcat Club proposal was led by College President Grier Martin and by Dean Frontis W. Johnston. Dr. Martin reminded the Council that last year the same proposal was made and that at the time, all the money granted to the Athletic Department for scholarships had not been awarded. His question was, “Even if the Athletic Department should get more money for scholarships, could it find enough high school athletes meeting the college entrance requirements that would accept the scholarships?” According to the same source, Dr. Johnston remarked that he was “not sure that the number of athletic scholarships is the answer to the degree of ‘success’ of a college. I don’t think that this is the way to make a better college.”

There are thirteen members on the committee, including three trustees, three members of the Wildcat Club, faculty members McGavock, Johnston, McCutchen, and Scott, and two students, Harold Westervelt, and Craig Wall.

Council Expects Large Student Body Turnout

The Kingston Trio will present a concert here on Tuesday, March 3, under the sponsorship of the Interfraternity Council. “The IFC is quite excited about signing the trio,” Vernon Anderson, president, reported. “They are about the most popular vocal group in the country today, and we think the concert will satisfy many student requests.”

STUDENT TICKETS

The musical program is scheduled for 8:30 p.m. in Chambers Auditorium. Tickets will be sold for $1.75 at the door for students and outsiders. However, the IFC is making a special offer of $1.50 for students who purchase their tickets early. According to the council, the tickets will be printed soon and a formal announcement will be made when they are ready for sale.

An appearance in connection with the trio’s hit record “Tom Dooley” has led to their Davidson contract. They will be in Statesville on Monday, March 2, for the dedication of a monument to the North Carolinian about whom the ballad has arisen. Realizing the closeness to Davidson, they made an offer to the IFC.

SERVICE PROJECT

“We got such an exceptional offer, we couldn't see turning it down,” Anderson explained. “The concert will be an IFC service project for the student body, not a moneymaking one. However, to break even, fifty to seventy-five percent of the students plus many outsiders must attend.”

The last similar undertaking by the IFC was during the 1956-1957 school year when it sponsored a concert by Louis “Satchmo” Armstrong. The project was unsuccessful financially, but the council felt several adverse factors were present, mainly that the showman was making his third campus appearance.

The Kingston Trio was formed a little over a year ago by three students completing their college work in California. Since that time, Dave Guard, Bob Shane, and Nick Reynolds have made a quick rise to the ranks of stardom with hit records and concerts. The trio specializes in folk-type singing—ballads, sea chants, calypso numbers, and western songs. Their concert will include a wide variety of material.

"Y" To Inaugurate Voluntary Chapel

The Y.M.C.A. Cabinet voted at its Tuesday night meeting to inaugurate voluntary chapel services, to be held during the chapel periods on Mondays and Wednesdays. These services will begin next Monday, February 9. “The services will be directed toward providing a religious outlet for individual worship which students fail to find in other programs on the campus. It is believed that the present great national popularity of the Kingston Trio will attract a better attendance.

Scott Woodmensee, chairman of the Y's Spiritual Life commission, will supervise these services, which will be held in Lingle Chapel. He stated that they will provide the needed chance for the Davidson student to participate in a meaningful voluntary worship experience.

Parker Supervises NCAA Committee

Davidson's Coach Charlie Parker has been elected chairman of the NCAA Wrestling Rules Committee, American intercollegiate wrestling’s governing body. Parker was named chairman in this year’s NCAA assembly at Cincinnati. Climaxing a five-year membership on the committee, he has also served on the legislative committee of the American Wrestling Coaches and Officials Association. Parker is currently chairman of the Southern Conference Wrestling Committee and is a member of both the Olympic and AAU wrestling committees.

Parker, a Davidson graduate, has been a perennial winning coach with his Wildcat wrestling teams. His term of office will cover the year of 1959-60, beginning this fall. He will also be present at the National Championships in Iowa City on March 20-21.

Mr. J. T. Allmon, personnel manager of Riegel Textile Corporation, interviews a Davidson student in the first day of interviews in the job placement program operated by the College Union. The bulk of the spring placement interviews for college seniors will follow in the coming weeks.
