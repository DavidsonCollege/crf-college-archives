3 THE DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 29, 1926

Varsity Ball Team Plays Four Games

The Wildcat baseball team left Tuesday on a week’s trip through Virginia, with four hard games facing them. After playing
Guilford Tuesday afternoon in Winston-Salem, the Wildcats opened their invasion of the Old Dominion against Washington and Lee Wednesday at
Lexington. V. M. I. will be the opponent today and Roanoke College at Salem Saturday will close the Virginia stand.
If the Wildcats cop the Guilford game they will leave the state firmly entrenched in first place in the race
for the state honors. This is probably the most important game of the trip.

The Wildcats will spend Tuesday night in Martinsville, Va., and go to Lexington Wednesday for the tilt with W. &
Lee. The General’s baseball team this year is one of the best they have produced in recent years and Captain
Alford and his mates will have a tough time in winning a decision over the “Minks.” The game with V.
M. I. today is a formidable one as the Cadets also have a winning club. Little is known of the
comparative strength of Roanoke College who will take the Davidson team on tomorrow.

The squad will enjoy a two-day layover Saturday and Sunday at Roanoke and return to the hill Monday night. Coach
Monk is not predicting a successful trip from the standpoint of victories but is satisfied the team will make a
better showing than it did on the recent South Carolina trip. The following men are making the trip: Coach Monk
Younger, Manager W. T. Spencer, and players, Black, Vance, Woodham, Glenn F., Johnnie Kugler, Doolin, Alford, Johnson, Davis, Huie, and
Ogden.

Davidson Loses to Both Furman and Clemson on Trip to Palmetto State

Wildcats Are Smothered Under an Avalanche of Hits and Effective Pitching

The Wildcat sluggers met with defeat in the games with Furman on Wednesday, and Clemson on Thursday. The Purple Hurricane
made a total of ten runs to the Wildcats’ three, while Clemson Tigers overcame the Cats, 9 to 0. In
the first game the Davidson nine fought hard, but the invincible Furman batsmen seemed to take all the breaks, which,
together with excellent fielding, gave them the victory. Huie and Oden pitched for Davidson but they seemed to have an
off day and the Furman team got 15 hits. Wood and Minnick, pitching for Furman, allowed the Davidson nine only
7 hits.

By Caldwell Withers

Last week was a busy one for Davidson athletes. Two varsity and four freshmen baseball games, track meets for both
the varsity and fresh, and the state tennis tournament, combined to make up a rather full six days.

Perhaps we talked too soon about Davidson having a comparatively easy time with South Carolina teams. Furman and Clemson put
it all over the Wildcats in the sand-lot pastime, while the Tigers won a triangular track meet last Saturday at
Clemson in which Davidson and Georgia Tech took part. The farmers-to-be garnered 57 and 1-3 points, the Yellow Jackets 43
and 1-3, while the local Presbyterians could amass only 25 and 1-3 markers. However, in Goodykoontz, who won first in
the century and 220 yard dashes and finished only half a stride behind the Southern champion Roy in the 440,
Davidson had the high point man of the meet.

Down at Greenville the Purple Hurricane of Furman continued its winning streak in baseball in spite of the storm warnings
hung out by Coach Monk's players. In copping this contest Furman ran the number of consecutive victories up to 11.

In winning the state championship in doubles Davidson’s number one team continued to keep the Wildcats in the limelight of
the tennis enthusiasts of the state. McCutcheon and Carr ran through their Duke opponents in the finals in straight sets.
Davidson has claimed four singles and two double champs since 1921 when Hugh Bradley started the ball rolling.

Clemson surprised even its most ardent supporters when with Lefty Smith in the box for the first time this year
due to an injury received during early practice.Passed ball, Thomas. Winning pitcher, Wood. Losing pitcher, Huie. Umpire, Llewellyn. Time 1:40.

On Thursday, the Clemson Tigers blanked the Wildcats while they were slamming out ten hits for nine runs. Laird and
Huie were the hurlers for Davidson and did their bit toward holding the score of the Clemson Tigers to the
lowest. Smith, pitching for Clemson, was the star of the game and gained much honor by fanning 11 Davidson men.
Davidson's Furman and Alford were the only Davidson players to solve the delivery of the Tiger hurler.

Goodykoontz broke his own record in the 220 last Saturday in the Clemson-Georgia Tech meet when he stepped the distance
in 22 seconds flat. In a previous track encounter this spring, he lowered the old mark, 22 3-5 seconds, by
1-10. His remarkable run was made in spite of a stiff wind which blew continuously during the entire meet.

Although the Wildkittens didn’t win a majority of their games on a four-game joint about North Carolina, they succeeded in
trouncing an old rival in the Tar Babies. Coming from behind in the last few rounds of this encounter, the
yearlings pounded the opposing pitchers for enough hits to push seven runs across the pan.

With Goodykoontz, Brand, Flynn, Kell, and possibly John Currie here next year, Davidson should be second to no college in
the south in dash men. What a relay team could be picked from that group!

PLAYING THE GAME
Freshmen Win One Game and Drop Three on Trip Through North Carolina
Effective Pitching and Loose Playing Cause Wildkittens to Lose Three Games

The Fresh baseball team returned Tuesday night from a trip over the state that resulted in one victory and three
defeats. They won the game with Carolina but lost to Wake Forest, State, and Duke.

The first game with Wake Forest was lost, 5 to 0. McClure pitched a good game, but Davidson was unable
to score any runs. Harper played the best game, and his fielding was the sensation of the tilt.

The second game was won from Carolina, 7 to 4. Meadows pitched a fine game, and Littlejohn was the star
of the infield. A home run and triple by Murray were the highlights of the game. Ratchford and Adams also
showed up well. Carolina had the big end of the score until the eighth inning when Davidson came from behind
and scored four runs in the eighth and three in the ninth. Murray’s home run came with the bases loaded.

The third game was lost to State with a score of 13 to 8. All four of Davidson's pitchers were
used, Meadows being the only effective one. State’s hitting won the game.

The fourth and last game was lost to Duke 10 to 7. Davidson led 4 to 0 up to the
fifth inning, and then Duke scored five runs. McClure was knocked out, and Meadows was sent in. Davidson again got
the lead but lost it when Light, who played on Davidson’s Fresh team last year, knocked a home run with
two on bases. Light was the star of Duke’s team with his effective pitching.

The bright lights of the trip were the playing of Ratchford, Murray, and Littlejohn. Meadows was the most effective pitcher
on the trip, hurling three of the four games played.

T. W. Lingle is in charge of the program arrangement and the entertainment of the speakers. This is the first
time that this event has ever been held at Davidson and will be the last for some years to come,
being shifted to a different school each year.

NETMEN COP TITLE
(Continued from page 1)
Bradley won the championship in the singles. In 1924, Harry Price won this championship and again brought the honor to
Davidson. Last year, McCutchen and Price won the championship in doubles, and this year McCutchen paired with Carr, repeating the
win again. A match with Wofford will be played on the Davidson courts Saturday, May. The Wofford netmen were the
champions of South Carolina last year, and the Wildcats will be hard-pressed Saturday.
