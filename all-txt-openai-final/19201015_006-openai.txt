THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER 15, 1920.

Christian Activities

DR. BYERS LEADS SUNDAY NIGHT “Y” SERVICE
The All-Sufficient Christ is Subject of His Talk.

Dr. F. E. A. Byers, professor of Spanish and German, spoke to the “Y” on “The All-Sufficient Christ” as the
only one who is able to meet our physical, mental, and spiritual needs. His opening thought was that of the
universal thirst, or desire, for the unattained. In some cases, it is the longing for power, in others it is
for gain, and still others for knowledge. All of these desires he showed to be futile, and that Christ alone
can satisfy.

Not only our bodily needs, but those of the soul are fulfilled by the Spirit of Christ. Dr. Byers stated
that the existence of God cannot be proved by philosophy or science. “God must be believed with the heart, not
comprehended with the mind.” Our Christian lives should be based on stern conviction that can withstand hardships. In bringing out
this thought, he pointed out the never-flinching endurance of the ancient martyrs, the founders of our faith. The futility of
material or scientific success in bringing peace has been shown by the late European war. It is “Christ alone that
can establish a brotherhood of man.”

His last point was our duty as true soldiers to our leader, Jesus Christ. The carrying on of His kingdom
depends on His followers; He has no other means of forwarding the cause among men.

The way the fellows turned loose on the songs was enough to make anyone want to get in and do
some singing himself. Enthusiasm and pep are the ever-manifested watchwords of the “Y” this year. Can’t we make the attendance
100 percent?

TWO BIBLE CLASSES SHOW 100 PERCENT ATTENDANCE
Third Floor NW. Chambers and Third Floor Watts lead college mission study classes with 100 percent. The honor roll for
mission study classes is a new idea and one which ought to bring out the whole student body on Sunday
morning. If a fellow is off the hill it does not count against his hall’s attendance. Only those who are
here and do not come out hurt their hall’s record. What will be the report next Sunday? That depends on
you. The discussion of Buddhism will be continued in next Sunday’s classes.

VOLUNTEER BAND CONTINUES STUDY OF EARLY MISSIONS
“Mac” Richards led the second morning meeting of the Volunteer Band in their study of “The History of Missions.” At
this meeting, particular attention was paid to Irish and Scandinavian missions of the fourth, fifth, and sixth centuries; the problems
which confronted these early missionaries and how they overcame them.

The next meeting will be led by W. P. Baba, of Persia. The subject for discussion will be “Early Missions
in the Near East.” The band invites everyone who is interested in missions and world affairs to meet with it
every Wednesday morning at 7 o’clock.

SHEARER CHAPEL TAKES THE LEAD IN NUMBERS
The attendance at Oak Grove is steadily increasing. Records show a 5 percent climb since last Sunday. Other schools show
growing interest.

COTTAGE ROOMS WELL HEATED

One half the rooms in the barracks have stoves and the rest will have them before the week is over.
At present, one of the most important pieces of furniture in any room of the new “bunkhouses” is a tall,
highly polished iron stove. It has an ash pit at the bottom large enough to hold at least one day's
ashes and a flat top well suited for heating water, etc. By proper use of the damper, these rooms can
be heated to any reasonable temperature with an economical consumption of coal, an article, the cost and scarcity of which
make it an item to be considered in any system of heating. The air draught comes up under the coal
pit and makes it very easy to get a good fire started in a short time. Many of these advantages
could not be found in a cheaper stove, but these are the most economical and endurable that will serve the
purpose and last indefinitely, if proper care is taken of them.

Mrs. D. Brown, of China Grove, has been spending the week-end with Dr. and Mrs. T. W. Lingle. A. L.
Wilson, 1920, has returned to Davidson for additional courses.

IREDELLIAN CLUB

Wooten, vice president; and F. W. Smith, secretary and treasurer. On the 7th of October, 1920, a very august and
serious group of young men from Iredell county met in 26 Chambers for the purpose of forming themselves into a
club to be known henceforth as the Iredellian Club. Their object being to maintain and stimulate the interest of Iredell,
and to increase from year to year, the membership of the club. The first thing of importance was the election
of officers. The results were as follows: C. N. Morrison, president; L. A. Wooten, vice president; and F. W. Smith,
secretary and treasurer. Other members of the club are D. W. Lowrance, J. F. Brawley, G. M. Morrow, H. W.
Rogers, J. P. Stevenson, W. H. Matheson, and W. P. McPherson. Two more names are to be added to the
roll in the near future. A committee was appointed to select a motto and colors for the club. Realizing that
nothing can live without food, the president appointed a committee on “feeds.” However, these are only “in view,” as yet,
so the treasurer says.
