**The Davidsonian**

Imagine sprinting through the woods for two hours, stumbling up hills, and through streams, while briars claw at your calves
and the quarter-sized blisters on your heels become more than a little bit painful.

It may sound like a scene from The Blair Witch Project, but in reality, it’s just another weekend in the
life of Monica Siegenthaler, a Davidson freshman who competes regularly in the international sport of orienteering.

Orienteering, which is somewhat obscure in the United States but fairly popular in Europe and Canada, involves running through the
woods with only a compass and a detailed map. Competitors must find several different points, called controls, placed throughout the
woods before returning to the starting point.

**Successful Forum Concludes Democrat Week**

The Young Democrats topped off their publicity week last Thursday with a discussion of the presidential candidates and their issues.
The informal event was sponsored by both the Democrats and the College Republicans.

Participants squared off in the Morrison Room of the Union to debate specific political topics as well as the relative
merits of Governor George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore. Health care reform and education prompted much discussion, as
did certain “character” questions concerning both candidates. However, attendees were just as eager to debate their political stances. Both sides
wrestled with the definitions of political conservatism and liberalism, as they related not only to issues but also to the
two parties. This forum was the culmination of the self-proclaimed Young Democrats Week at Davidson. President and co-founder Maggie Kozicharow
emphasized that the organization is still trying to make its presence known on campus. “We decided it was time to
become more active and to raise issues,” she noted.

Beginning Monday, April 10th, the Democrats manned a booth in Chambers with literature regarding different issues of concern to their
organization. Members of five different issue committees were on hand to provide information between Monday and Thursday. The five different
themes were gun control, health care, women’s issues, the environment, and education.

Kozicharow explained the role these issue committees have played in their organization. Each is chaired by a different member and
is responsible for meeting on its own to research and to discuss its particular area of interest. In addition to
providing information to the campus at large, this division of labor, admitted Kozicharow, helps keep members informed on issues outside
of their expertise.

The discussion period on Thursday night reflected the efforts of both Democrats and Republicans on campus. Once the Democrats had
decided to make a concentrated effort to publicize their group, they contacted the Republicans in hopes of organizing a debate
of some sort. Kozicharow said that her initial contacts with the College Republicans were very positive and that her counterparts
seemed eager to participate.

Commenting on the week, Kozicharow expressed her pleasure at the response from students, especially on Thursday night. “I think we
were pretty successful,” she concluded. In particular, they had hoped to initiate some sort of open and critical dialogue with
the Republicans on campus, which she felt that they had accomplished for the most part.

Student Wins Intercollegiate Orienteering Championships

Meets typically consist of two days of running — the times from both days are then combined and the competitor
who finds all of the controls in the least amount of time wins.

Two weekends ago, Siegenthaler competed in the US Intercollegiate Orienteering Championships. After finishing second in Saturday’s competition with orienteerers from
schools such as West Point, Georgetown, Naval Academy, and Harvard, she rallied against sore muscles and blisters to finish first
on Sunday with a time fast enough to crown her the Women’s College Varsity Champion, the equivalent of the NCAA
championship in her sport.

Siegenthaler, who is also a member of Davidson Crew, is now trying to decide whether to continue rowing next spring
or to train on her own for the Orienteering National Championships.

Correction: The recent Confederate Flag forum was sponsored by the Union Board’s Campus Forums committee rather than the Student Government
Association.

Kozicharow gave a few indications of the immediate future of the Young Democrats at Davidson. Though she doubted that there
would be another informal discussion with their rivals, she mentioned the possibility of bringing in a speaker. Gayle Mahood, former
president of the Young Democrats of Charlotte/Mecklenburg County, may speak on campus this semester, or if not, then certainly next
semester. Beyond that, the president suggested that the group will continue to make its voice heard and will try to
muster support for candidate Gore.
