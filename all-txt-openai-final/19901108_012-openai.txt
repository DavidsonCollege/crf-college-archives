FREDDIE by Z. W. Malis

FREDDIE, I HOPE YOU ARE SATISFIED THAT YOU FAILED TO PARTICIPATE IN ALCOHOL AWARENESS WEEK!

PERSONALLY, I'M A LOT MORE AWARE OF ALCOHOL AND ITS EFFECTS AFTER HAVING CONSUMED IT THAN AFTER HAVING NOT CONSUMED
IT. THAT WAS WHAT THIS WHOLE THING WAS ABOUT, WASN'T IT?

IF THEY HAD A SOBRIETY AWARENESS WEEK, I'D BE MORE THAN...

HAPPY HOROSCOPE
By KRISTEN STRICKER

SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Expect much attention from family and friends, so use this opportunity to strengthen close relationships. Your
love interest, however, isn't especially receptive to you this week. Don’t give up! Early next week things will greatly improve
(probably around Monday). Use your powers of persuasion to get people involved in a cause close to your heart.

SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): You’ve come through a rough couple of weeks, and now it’s your time to party! Use
this optimum time to develop new friendships - there are several people wanting to get to know you better. Now
is a good time to overcome your fear of public speaking because people are especially willing to listen to you.

CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): Don’t let past experiences rule your behavior today. Forgive that person who disappointed you before; give
him or her another chance. This weekend is a good time to finally do what you've been putting off.

AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): Let your imagination run wild - it needs the exercise! Stop being so rational and reap
the benefits. A new relationship could develop with someone you never would have imagined. Don’t miss the chance!

TAURUS (Apr. 20-May 20): Don’t let your pride get in the way of accepting help from others. Although you’re usually
the one your friends turn to in times of need, the tables are reversed now. Your money situation will change
dramatically - help make sure it’s for the better by not splurging for a while. Friday is a good time
to start a new routine.

GEMINI (May 21-Jun. 20): Conditions are right for a big change in attitude. Follow through on all those promises you've
recently made or envisioned, and you’ll start gaining others’ respect. Love isn’t in the future, but a close friendship could
develop.

CANCER (Jun. 21-Jul. 22): Start standing up for yourself if you want to move ahead. The moon will exert tremendous
influence on your actions.
