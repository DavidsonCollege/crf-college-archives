Wrestling falls on senior day to Duquesne

Davidson wrestling came up just short this past Friday on senior day against Duquesne, dropping a 19-18 decision at Belk Arena. The team gained wins from Ben Altman ’10, Alex Radsky ’11, Trebor Clavette ’08, Sam O’Hair ’09, and Charlie Wolff ’11, but it was not enough to chalk up another W for the 'Cats.

As usual, Altman opened up the match at 125. He took down his opponent with a 4-1 decision to put Davidson up 3-0. Radsky kept the momentum going with a close 4-3 decision over his counterpart from the Dukes, making it 6-0 'Cats.

The Dukes struck back, winning the next four matches, including a heartbreaking decision against Carl Sandercock ’10 in overtime. Joe McGinley ’11 also wrestled a very close match before falling 9-7. Just like that, Davidson’s 6-0 lead evaporated to a 16-6 deficit.

It was up to Clavette, in his final match in Belk Arena, to turn the tide. Prior to the match, he had been honored as Davidson’s lone senior on Senior Day. He responded by defeating his opponent in a 7-4 decision to cap his career at home. The 'Cats had pulled back within reach, 16-9.

Davidson dropped the next match, however, and wins in the last two matches could put them over the top. O’Hair, wrestling at 197, pinned his man 4:51 into the match, giving the team six valuable points. The score now read 19-15, with only Wolff to go before the end. Once again, Wolff’s match was a low-scoring affair. He won the match by a 1-0 decision, which inched the 'Cats closer. However, the team as a whole dropped the match by only one point, certainly one of the most frustrating losses of the season.

Redemption may be just around the corner, however, in the biggest event for the team all year, the Southern Conference Tournament. The tournament will be all day on March 8th in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The team will look for a strong showing and a bit of payback for close losses earlier this year. Many, with a strong performance, have a chance to make the NCAA Tournament as well.

“Teamwise, we’re looking to qualify two or three for the NCAAs,” O’Hair says. “We’d also like to beat The Citadel and VMI. Overall, we want to finish the season on a strong note.”

The women’s lacrosse team suffered a tough loss on Sat. Feb. 23 at Richardson Stadium. The American Eagles and the Wildcats battled it out in double overtime but with only 54 seconds left in the game, the Eagles scored the winning goal, bringing the final score to 11-10.

Jen Crawford ’10 once again proved herself to be a powerhouse by contributing four goals to the Wildcats' total of ten. Haley Cook ’10 and Emily Palmer ’08 scored two goals apiece for the team. Callie Seymour ’09 nabbed one goal for the Wildcat Women as did Senior Sarah Walter.

Even though American did come out on top, the Wildcats and the Eagles were equal in shots on goal, both having 26. Davidson led the Eagles in ground balls, 19-15, but the Wildcats committed more turnovers than American, 26-20.

“It was a really tough way to lose such a competitive game, but I know everyone on the team gave 100 percent,” Crawford said. “What we need to do now is move forward using what we’ve learned from Saturday and focus on the next game. We’ll definitely be ready to dominate American next year.”

The Wildcats will continue their season with their fourth home game in a row on Fri. Game time is set for 3 p.m.As the Wildcats will take on Long Island.

The women’s team faced off against Chattanooga on Saturday at the Knobloch Tennis Center, winning by a perfect 7-0 margin to improve to 7-2 on the season. To kick things off, Davidson won the doubles points with wins at the No. 1 and No. 3 positions. Kelsey Linville ’08 and Virginia Berry ’10 teamed up for an impressive 8-3 victory at No. 1 doubles while Kim Whelan ’08 and Lora Dushanova ’09 scored a shutout (8-0) win at the No. 3 doubles spot. All four doubles players also scored singles victories with the addition of two more singles wins by Michelle Fanney ’09 at the No. 3 singles spot and Meredith Skeeters ’08 at the No. 5 singles spot. Skeeters went on to win her fifth straight match while all of the other singles players added to their season win totals.
