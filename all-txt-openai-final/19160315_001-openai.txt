Fourth Lyceum Attraction
Morrow Brothers Quartet Renders Good Entertainment.

One of the best Lyceum attractions given at Davidson this year was rendered last night by the Morrow Brothers Quartet. This quartet is composed of four brothers, each possessing a rich, harmonious voice, and the selections rendered showed ability and skill. The vocal music consisted of ensemble singing and solos, while very good instrumental music was also given by the quartet. Possibly the part most enjoyed was the excellent readings and character impersonations. Many times the audience was moved to laughter by the clever costumes and excellent impersonations of Mr. E. M. Morrow. The whole program was well arranged and rendered in fine style, causing everyone to enjoy the evening.

Crisp rendered a paper on General Davidson, after which hot chocolate was served. The faculty members, Professors Fulton, Sentelle, and McConnell, were also present.

CLASS BASKETBALL

Arrangements for the playing of the games in the spring basketball contest have been made. The Seniors have asked that they be allowed to withdraw from the series because of the work upon them.

Dr. Hamilton Lectures on Principles of War and Peace and Their Values Discussed.

Saturday night Dr. J. DeR. Hamilton, Professor of History at the University of NorthCarolina gave a lecture on International Relations in Shearer Hall. Dr. Hamilton is working in the interests of the American Association of International Conciliation, and his presence here was secured by the recently organized International Polity Club. Dr. Hamilton stressed the fact that the world’s answer to the question, peace or war, is more freighted with possibilities today than ever before. Then he discussed the arguments of those who believe war is inevitable and those who believe it can and will be abolished. From the teaching of history, he showed the fallacy of the war myth. “No good thing has ever been brought out by war which could not have been better secured by peaceful action. Men must be brought to realize that there is a higher patriotism than the lust of the primitive savage for blood.” He then outlined the fundamental idea of the lately established peace unions. Although they are only a beginning and still grope in the dark, they tend toward one ideal. “This provides for the use of force against any member of the union that goes to war without giving a chance for arbitration. Education has made the individual settle his disputes in the courts, and education alone will make the nations pursue the same course.” Dr. Hamilton closed by stating his belief that it rests on the United States to lead the world “through law to justice, through justice to peace.” After the lecture, the local Polity Club gathered at the home of Professor Currie for discussion of club affairs and to meet Dr. Hamilton.

EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE DISCUSSES ATHLETIC MATTERS

A meeting of the executive committee of the Athletic Association was recently held for the consideration of several important athletic matters. Wood presided over the meeting in the absence of Drs.

However, nothing definite was decided, and the matter will be taken up later. The following three men were recommended for assistant baseball managers: J.T. Gillespie, S.C. Harris, and J.C. Paisley. Letters for basketball were awarded to Reese, R. Walker, A.C. Wood, Hengeveld, King, and Younger. It was also decided that season tickets for the baseball season be sold for $1.50.
