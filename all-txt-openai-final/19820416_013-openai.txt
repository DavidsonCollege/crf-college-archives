Way up in the Henegar’s tree just now;
picking the last apples, and wind over the hill
coming on.

- Swaying

I reached and it blew them down; swaying again
reached and it blew them past me; again
reached and it blew us together,

~ me and the branch
the branch and the breeze
whispering together
bending, almost breaking:

and on the near ridge crest

on the slate-grey sky, I saw Jack’s cows
standing on Gerald’s new roof

and the workmen hammering at their feet

and thought

bowed to the hammers for their bread
as they to the grass hammering on
Enns on the wind blowing

on and on...

I to the apples

apples to the branch, branch to the wind
I to the branch to the wind
and the beef, and the workmen:

where my brothers

is the altar; and whose...

is the sacrifice; and for whom
bow the apples,

blows me wind;

as I reached for the apples:

was I reaching for the wind,
in the top of the tree
the branches swayed

and I too swayed —
and sang.

The Daughters of Blum

The daughters of Blum
Are growing older.

There chill winter days,
Locking their rooms, they

Seem to pause, checking,

Perhaps, for the lights,
The window curtain,
Or something they want
To remember that
Keeps slipping their minds.

You have seen them, how
They stand there, perplexed,
And a little shocked—

As though they had spied,
Unexpectedly,

From one corner of

One eye, the lives they
Must have left somewhere
Once on a dresser—
Gloves waiting for hands.

Charles Wright ’57
