Kannapolis
here we come

By Christy SHI
Travel Correspondent

Less than 30 minutes from
Davidson lies the mill town of
Kannapolis. There you will find
Cannon Village, a unique village
which boasts the world’s largest
towel, as well as factory-direct
outlet prices.

ON THE ROAD AGAIN

Although Fieldcrest Cannon
is the anchor of Cannon Village,
many other stores line the brick-
paved street. The shops are a com-
bination of small-scale outlets and
specialty stores. Outlets include
Waccamaw, Lee, BonWorth,
VanHeusen, Hanes, Dress Barn,
and a superb discount bookstore.
Other merchants include Southern
Christmas, Rug Oasis, Uncommon
Scents, and the Brass Exchange.

There are many furniture
stores and an antique mall. For
women, a wonderful selection of
fine clothing can be found at
Virginia’s Inc. or Anne’s Dress
Shop.

Eating establishments are lim-
ited. Fast food in Kannapolis runs
the gamut, but in Cannon Village
one has only three selections: K&W
Cafeteria, Lil Amos, and Junction
Café and Grill. We chose the last
option, and it was a good choice.
With a nostalgic atmosphere, this
diner served up great southern food.
Lunch plates include your selec-
tion of vegetables, or the Junction’s
specialty, barbecued pork. For
dessert, I recommend the Sundrop
Cake, which is made with the re-

gional soft drink of that name and
other citrus flavors. Although the
selection at the Junction would be
scant for picky eaters, or espe-
cially those who are extremely
health conscious, the diner was a
great local find.

Around the corner from the
Junction is a theater with a dated
marquee where movies are a dollar
per showing. Unlike the sign, the
movies are not dated; showing this
weekend were Seven and It Takes
Two. If you are a photographer,
this theater would make a great
composition. Non-photographers
may also want to take some snap-
shots to remember the excursion;
every non-residential building in
Kannapolis is built with brick,
which makes for a beautiful set-
ting. Cannon Village itself ap-
pears very similar to such historic
towns as Williamsburg or Old Sa-
lem, and it will be beautiful in
springtime.

The most direct way to get to
Kannapolis, and Cannon Village,
is to take I-85 North to exit 58 and
follow the signs. I was shown a
back route, which I believe is
shorter and know to be much more
scenic.

Take Concord Road to Grey
Road. Follow Grey Road until it
dead-ends at a T-intersection. Go
left. At the next T-intersection,
take a right. You will be on road
136. Follow this into Kannapolis.
You will see evidence of the mill
town in the construction of the
houses. At the stoplight, take a
right, and proceed into Kannapolis.
At the next stoplight, go left, and
you will see signs to Cannon Vil-

house to the other, hurling our bod-
ies towards the wall, sliding on the
plastic. Then the naked freshmen
boys run through.”

Who began this? We all ac-
cept it as the norm, but we must
admit that it is weird.

I don’t think that I was the
only one on Patterson Court Fri-
day night who stood back and sur-
veyed the scene with a skeptical
eye. I met a guy at Wake Forest the
next night who had come to
Davidson to experience the fabled
evening.

“I had to wear a raincoat to go
out,” he said. “It was really
strange.”

Sometimes things like Self-
Selection night go better left
unanalyzed. The screaming,
streaking, spraying masses might
as well carry on with little thought
to what they (we) are actually do-
ing. It’s safer that way.

I don’t know when I became
so cynical. Freshman year, I
thought that I wanted nothing more
than to soak myself in champagne
and roll around on the floor. Sopho-
more year, all I wanted was to soak
others in champagne and dance on
a bench.
OK, so maybe I’m not exactly
the wizened junior that I pretend to
be. I still had fun Friday night. I’ll
admit that while my friends stayed
in the basement, I ran upstairs to
peek at the freshmen running in. I
even let some champagne get on
the precautionary spandex I wore.
By picture time, I was ready to hurl
myself into the front row and
scream when the photographer took
the picture so I would look like I
was having the time of my life.
Yes, Self-Selection is just an-
other crazy Davidson idiosyncrasy.
Love it or hate it, it will always be
(we hope), and none of us are the
better or the worse for it.
However, we will always re-
member it. Maybe it’s not a story
for the kids, but it will always be a
reminder of our crazy, stupid col-
lege days.
Or maybe not.
