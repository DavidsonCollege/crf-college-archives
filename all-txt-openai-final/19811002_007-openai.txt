Cross Country Finds Cake Race at Lynchburg

by John Hoots '82

Randy “Old Man” McManus led the Davidson thinclads to an impressive victory over Lynchburg College 22-37, Roanoke College 17-42, and Eastern Mennonite College 20-11 at Lynchburg last weekend. McManus, who claims he is still not in top form, led all finishers with a time of 27:22 over the 5-mile course.

Frank Ivey, who finished fourth overall in 27:49, made an incredible race effort, running the last half of the course with severe cramps. Danny Armistead and Garry Sullivan, the Bohemian Love Palace team, finished together in 27:53 and 27:58. Speedster Sullivan had a bad fall at a tricky spot at the 2.5-mile mark but recovered, pacing Danny to the finish. Smack Smith finished up the top five list in 28:29, a victim of the pizza from the night before. As a team, Davidson looked strong, with a pack of 7 runners dominating the early stages of the race. The outcome was apparent by the 2-mile mark. Coach Martin’s methodical strategy is to start in a pack and to run faster and faster each week. The Cats, now 3-3 on the season, have a tough one tomorrow morning: a 10-kilometer at Davidson, against Southern Conference rivals Furman and Appalachian State.

Women Dominate Lynchburg
The D.C. women’s team posted a near-shutout 16-47 victory, dominating Lynchburg College’s women’s team last Saturday. Marian Hill ran extremely well with a time of 21:47 for the 5K (3.1 mile) course. Lynchburg placed only two girls in the Davidson ranks (5th and 9th) as Carie Nunn (21:55), Tamara Foreman (22:01), Sarah Patterson (22:03), and Jem Webb (23:11) rounded out the top five list. Elisabeth Hargrove, Chris Seel, Jenna McGee, and Sarah Todd all finished ahead of the third Lynchburg runner.

This was Marian’s big comeback after a disappointing fourth-place finish at Duke the week before. For Carie, who cannot even practice with the team because of chemistry labs, this second-place finish showed just how disciplined and strong she is, adding to the Lady Cats’ strongest team ever. The girls take on Appalachian State here tomorrow, in a 5000-meter duel, hoping to better their 2-0 record.
