**How to respect our Christian heritage**

Davidson is a college committed to a “Christian tradition,” yet we also claim to reach out “beyond the Christian community to the whole human community and necessarily includes an openness to and respect for the world’s various religious traditions.” This is an honorable statement of purpose, and one that we can and should all look to. Unfortunately, we do not currently quite live by those words.

Davidson’s Board of Trustees has continued to maintain a requirement that all trustees be “active members of a Christian Church.” That requirement could well change very soon. Last spring, the Board of Trustees held a retreat in which they explored “what it means to be a Church-related college in the Reformed tradition.” After that retreat, the executive committee of the Board was asked to look into the trustee religion requirement in greater detail. On Friday, that committee will report its findings to the Board. Although we do not yet know what it is they will report, we can step back and take a look at what steps Davidson has already taken to bring us closer to our statement of purpose.

Today, Davidson is more racially, geographically, economically, and religiously diverse than ever before. Nearly a fifth of Davidson students identify themselves as either having no religious faith or belonging to a religion other than Christianity. The College has taken enormous strides in recent years to not just accept students of various religious faiths, but to actively embrace students with different beliefs. While we are certainly not perfect in our respect for all faiths, as the recent scheduling of Homecoming weekend on Yom Kippur clearly showed, Davidson is working hard to get there.

Among the steps the College has taken in recent years include the addition of an adjunct Jewish Chaplain and the designation of funds for events planned by the Jewish Student Union, the Muslim Student Association, and the Interfaith groups. We have taken these steps not just because we want to, but also because we have to if we are to fulfill our stated purpose. As a college founded in the Reformed tradition of Christianity, we as an institution affirm an appreciation of and a respect for individuals of all different beliefs. It is precisely because of our Presbyterian tradition that the Trustees should seek to change this requirement. Doing so would allow us to both maintain our heritage by reaffirming the Reformed traditions of our founders, and to look to the future by fully embracing students of all beliefs as full members of the Davidson community, entitled to all the rights and privileges that come along with that membership.

**U.S. keeps N. Korea at bay**

Did anyone notice that Kim Jong-Il has been mighty quiet lately? It is about time that liberals shut up about North Korea. August 28, 2003 was the last time we heard a bad word out of the Asian third of the “Axis of Evil.” Over a year later, North Korea has not made good on any of its alleged threats or promises regarding the testing and deployment of tactical nuclear weapons. The BBC has confidently stated that the country fears an American invasion similar to that in Iraq. Yes, I said it, Iraq: that dirty word that connotes everything from imperialism and unilateralism to failure and poor judgment.

It is now time to put a Kerry comment in perspective. Ninety percent of casualties in Iraq, he says, are American, and that because Bush did not go through the UN (which, oddly enough, would never have gone thanks to the oil for food programs of France and Russia). The most official UN war ever to take place saw nearly 37,000 Americans die in Korea. As part of the joint UN police action, with all the approval and global test-passing Senator Kerry could desire, the US fatalities were 93 percent of the UN side. Since then, we have gotten Poland on our side and cut our casualty percentage by 3. Coincidence? Or is it just that Poland is more helpful than the U.N. in wartime?

Say what you will about being a bully to poor little Saddam; the Iraqi Freedom Coalition did not go in with only Iraqi freedom on their minds. Bush and other leaders specifically stated early on that, by demonstrating the price of supporting international terrorism and weapons proliferation, they hoped to give nations such as Iran and North Korea incentive to talk peacefully, rather than ignite conflicts. You do not have to win by taking out the strongest players. In this case, taking on the weakest nation of the “Axis of Evil” has been a rather effective tactic for intimidating anyone who might otherwise have an itchy finger on the button.

As far as I’m concerned, a terrorist is anyone who wishes to instill terror in civilians. Judging by how anxious most Americans get when Kim Jong-Il comes up in serious conversation, I would call him a terrorist. Senator Kerry may talk a lot about how he will do a better job keeping WMDs out of terrorist hands, but the fact is that they are already there. Cleaning out the Soviet Union’s old nuclear weapons is a wonderful idea—one that every candidate after Ronald Reagan has emphasized. The biggest threat, however, is not in Russian...storage, but in what may be in KWP silos. But personally, I will sleep well knowing that Secretary Kim is still more afraid of us. Sleep tight.

War in Iraq closer than we realize

Thank you so very much for your article, “War in Iraq hits Davidson.” I very much enjoyed reading the article and once again was in awe of our military personnel and their wonderful spirits and courage. Just as a note to you, I bet that if you do a little exploring you will find that there are several students on your campus who have brothers, sisters, parents, cousins, etc., who are presently serving in Iraq or Afghanistan. It might be interesting to see how many students are affected by the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Davidson is a small supportive community that supersedes politics when it comes to taking care of its own members and I think it might be surprising to learn how many people are impacted. I ask this question because I know that my daughter, who is a sophomore, has a brother serving with the Marines in Iraq and I am sure that she is not alone. I would be very interested to learn the outcome of your research if you should be inclined to do a little exploring. Again, many thanks for your article.

Bookstore survey

From textbook availability, to store hours, and product selection, the staff of the Davidson College Bookstore wants to know what students think about the store’s operations. The Bookstore is conducting a comprehensive customer satisfaction survey on the web beginning Friday, October 8. The survey questionnaires will be sent to each student e-mail account on that day. A coupon for 20 percent off one imprinted item will be used as an incentive. The survey will run through October 15, 2004. All surveys will be compiled, tabulated, and analyzed by the research staff of the National Association of College Stores (NACS). NACS is the non-profit trade association for college and university bookstores across the country. The goal of the survey is to help improve store operations and services to Bookstore customers.

No flip-flopper, Bush is consistently wrong

By HALLEY AELION
Staff Columnist

Mixed signals. Bush is very, very concerned about mixed signals. So worried, in fact, that he was willing to sacrifice the majority of his time at the debate last Thursday to harping on Kerry’s so-called flip-flopping tendencies. Good thing Bush is coming through loud and clear. What’s his message? He’s right, and to Hell with anyone who does not agree with him on anything and everything. Bush’s main (and most repeated) complaint during the debate was that Kerry cannot offer the American voters a concrete stance and plan of action in regards to the war in Iraq. Which raises a good question. How does one comment on a war directed against the wrong country? Can one really support such a thing and be considered presidential material? Though fighting the correct country may seem a minor point to a man as great and busy as George Bush, it actually makes a difference to most Americans, not to mention most of the world. Considering this fact, does Bush honestly expect Kerry to stand up and endorse his misguided “war on terror,” which is targeting the wrong country and costing precious American lives in foreign territory? It would be political suicide! Something Bush is well on his way to committing in the minds of all logical American voters, tired of seeing their sons and daughters die far from home.

As Bush loved to remind us during the debate, Kerry did endorse the war in the beginning, and then later stated that it was “the wrong war at the wrong time in the wrong place.” In fact, the way Bush was obsessively repeating this phrase during the debate would lead many to think he was actually beginning to believe it. Too bad he’s trapped into his blustering, unsupported, dangerous, and misdirected plan of action against Iraq and its people. When it comes down to it, the leader of our country really is leading a war in the wrong country. He is after the wrong bad guy. Saddam Hussein may very well be in prison, but he wasn’t the one who attacked us. It was Osama Bin Laden, the Afghanistan terrorist, who led the attack on America on September 11. The good news is, America is not trapped into that same ill-fated plan, not yet at least. Not if we make the right decision in November at the polls. Bush needs to open those infamous squinty eyes. He needs to realize the American people do not need a brick wall as their commander in chief. They need a man (or woman) with a heart and a good head on their shoulders.

If Hitler, midway through the Holocaust, realized the massacre of the entire European Jewish population might be a mistake, and ended his policy of mass genocide, would Bush have thought less of him as a leader because he “flip-flopped?” From the number of times he condemned Kerry’s attempts to adapt his war-time policy to the reality of the situation in the contemporary world, the logical conclusion would have to be yes. So open your eyes as well, America. The past four years have been far from our country’s finest when it comes to foreign relations. We have lost allies, we have lost the world’s respect, and we have lost thousands of our soldiers. It is time for a change. It is time for us to show the world we can adapt to the situation around us. It is time to take Bush out of power, and put Kerry where he belongs: in office.
