**THE DAVIDSONIAN, FEBRUARY 27, 1935**

**FRENCH CIRCLE WILL GIVE PLAY**

Arrangements Are Made To Present "Le Medecin Malgre Lui" At Winthrop

The members of Le Cercle Francais, an honorary French fraternity at Davidson, have completed arrangements to present a play at
Winthrop College, South Carolina, on February 13. The cast of "Le Medecin Malgre Lui," the play to be offered at
Winthrop College, will consist entirely of members of the Davidson French club. This is a one-act French play.

The Converse French society, L'Alliance Francais, is to offer a play before the Davidson student body in the near future.
The Davidson club will give a return engagement there later on this year. Dr. Johnson, who is the French professor
at Winthrop College, states that the college authorities recently installed the French society to create relations by offering a return
engagement.

Dr. W. P. Cumming, professor of English at Davidson, will accompany the members of Le Cercle Francais on their visit
to Winthrop College. Dr. G. B. W. Cumming, head of the French department, will attend the club on their visit.

Davidson, handicapped by having to fire by almost pinning his opponent in the first few seconds, scored: State 7 1/4,
Davidson 1 1/4. However, the latter squirmed out of his grasp to prolong the match. Minutes later, he pinned him
with the use of a half-nelson and body scissors. Both men fought with experience, but Quarterman easily proved himself the
better. Score: State 7, Davidson 1.

165—Blackwelder produced the offensive and soon had the situation well in hand, although Troxler, who usually wins by pinning his
man, had to be content with a time decision of 1 minute and 11 seconds. Score: State 7 1/4, Davidson
11 1/4.

175—Captain Charles Fort, who has not been defeated this year, met Croom. After an extra period had been taken, the
contest was called a draw; the first for Captain Fort this season. Score: State 9, Davidson 14.

Unlimited—Hodgin, after another extra period of fighting, was awarded a draw with Croom of State, in a fairly even combat.
With each man being awarded one and a half points, the meet ended with the final score of Davidson 15
1/4, State 10 1/4.

**Students To Speak At Sunday Vespers**

Subject Of "Peace" Will Be Discussed By McMullen, Harlan, And Coit

"Peace," the general topic for the student vesper program next Sunday night, will be developed by three speakers. The first
talk, to be made by John McMullen, will deal with "The Necessity for World Peace," following which Paul Harlan will
discuss "Methods for Obtaining World Peace." The third talk will be of a more specific and practical nature, as Bob
Coit tells "What a Davidson Man Can Do" toward furthering the cause of universal peace.

Audley Gammon, under whose supervision the program is being built, states that there will be no special music other than
that of the organ. Hymns and prayer will be in keeping with the general theme of the program.

**YMCA Sends Out Deputation Teams**

Street was the speaker and Bob Wilson and Bill Laws furnished the music. They were accompanied by Bill Link and
Dr. Harding.One On March 3, a deputation is going to Bob Smith will speak to the young people, and Albert
McClure is to be the speaker at the evening service in the First Presbyterian Church. Special music will be furnished

To Charlotte Jaycees
Norton G. Pritchett, director of athletics at Davidson, spoke to the Charlotte Junior Chamber of Commerce at their regular weekly
meeting last Wednesday. Captain Pritchett's talk was in preparation for the indoor track meet which was held Monday. Pritchett said
in his talk that he believed that track is the cleanest and finest of all sports and that he had
seen men work out their own salvation on the track who otherwise would not have participated in athletics. After expressing
interest in the indoor meet, Pritchett said that it would be one of the most worthwhile events that the Junior
Chamber had yet sponsored.

Davidson Alumnus Discusses Music
(Continued from Page 1, Col. 6)
“How did you become interested in the band?”
“When the American Legion donated band instruments to the high school, I was delegated to supervise the use of the
instruments. I became so interested in the work that I took it on as a permanent sideline. Eventually, it took
so much time that, rather than give up the band, I gave up my business interests. I've been with the
band for ten years.”
“What part of your band do you stress the most?”
“I have always emphasized sight-reading as absolutely essential. At every practice, I give the band one unfamiliar selection to read
through. To this, I attribute the fact that many of our boys have secured first chairs in college bands.”
“What is your greatest difficulty with the band?”
“Tone, probably. In any band, the ultimate aim is to acquire a perfection of tone, which is never quite reached.”
After more or less informal discussion in a lighter vein, I left, knowing that Mr. Harper had to return to
Lenoir that night. Several times each year, Captain Harper returns to his Alma Mater, showing himself one of Davidson's staunchest
supporters among the alumni. Captain Harper is also the donor of the Harper Inter-Fraternity Scholarship Cup.

experience, then listed the three major problems which must be faced once recovery is begun. “While the depression is not
at an end, we are pretty safe in believing we are on the road to recovery,” Dr. Nathan stated.
Saturday morning, the interest centered around a discussion group on the question, “Should Munitions Industry Remain in Private Hands or
in the Control of the Government?” This group meeting was conducted by Dr. C. B. Gosnell, Emory University, and Dr.
J. M. McConnell, Davidson. This question provoked a very hot discussion, as it has been chosen by most collegiate debating
teams for their regular debates this year, and as, in view of recent investigations, it has become a matter of
universal interest. At the close of the discussion period, the group voted 141 to 7 in favor of government control.
In the regular annual business meeting which followed, these officers for the coming year were selected: William Bomar, Wofford College,
first vice-president; Peggy Birch, Randolph-Macon, second vice-president; and Edward Sell, University of Georgia, recording secretary. Other officers will be chosen
by the host college of the next conference. Tentative invitations were received for the convention next year, but a definite
decision as to the next place of meeting was deferred until a later time. The meeting closed with the luncheon
session Saturday. Officers of this conference were: Charles Lucas, Davidson, president; Arsen Yakoubian, University of Alabama, first vice-president; Zuline Morris,
Brenau College, second vice-president; W. C. Neill, Davidson, corresponding secretary; Mary Lou Klauber, Randolph-Macon, recording secretary; Warner DuBose, Davidson, treasurer.

Handling Turkish tobacco in the Liggett & Myers modern factory at Smyrna, Turkey. The selection, buying, and preparation of the
right kinds of Turkish tobaccos for making Chesterfield Cigarettes is a business in itself. We have buyers in all the
tobacco markets of Turkey and Greece, including Xanthi, Cavalla, Smyrna, and Samsoun. And at Smyrna, Chesterfield has built the most
modern tobacco plant in the Near East. Here, the spicy, aromatic Turkish leaf is sorted and graded under the eyes
of our own tobacco men. Then it is put away to age in its own climate for two years or
more to make it milder and better-tasting. When you blend and cross-blend the right kinds of aromatic Turkish tobacco with
mild ripe home-grown tobaccos as we do in Chesterfield, you have the cigarette that’s milder, the cigarette that tastes better.
