say Alfred the Great established it, although this guess is generally discredited. In 1130 lectures in theology were in progress. By the thirteenth century, the attendance had increased to above 3,000. The speaker stressed the point that Oxford was not made but simply grew. Groups of students gathered at the hotels and inns and hired professors to teach them. Merton, the first college of which there is record, was founded in 1274. The last college had its beginning as late as 1870. From early times, the royalty and wealthy citizens of England have been endowing the various colleges, so that now there are 22 for men and four for women.

The “Oxanians” are accustomed to discuss topics of the day in a rather intellectual manner at their afternoon tea. This informal event is the greatest social affair of the day. Mr. Richards stated that these discussions are, on the whole, very profitable. Oxford is not deeply spiritual, although students must attend services once on Sunday and several times during the week. Once, a student turned Mohammedan to escape chapel attendance. The following morning, the college president sent him a prayer rug by a scout with instructions to arise with the sun and offer his prayers toward Mecca in the cloister. The student relapsed into Christianity.

All students take some form of exercise in the afternoon. Rowing is the most popular sport and the winner of his “blue” in a race against Cambridge becomes immediately popular and has obtained the greatest athletic honor available. Rugby, a form of football, is also popular. The English marvel at American football with its “helmets,” “padding” and awful roughness. The intercollegiate contests are practically continuous. These are poorly attended as the students are themselves at the time engaged in some sport.

Mr. Richards finally expressed his admiration of the cordial and hospitable treatment accorded the some 200 American students studying at Oxford. He attributes this attitude to the natural hospitality of the English people and their desire to maintain friendly relations with the American people.

After Mr. Richards had finished his lecture, Doctor Martin introduced Dr. C. R. Harding as the next speaker of the evening. In his introductory speech, Doctor Martin stated that Doctor Harding had taken and brought back with him very voluminous notes; in fact, so many that he was forced to ship part of them back by parcel post, and the remainder as extra baggage. In opening his speech, Doctor Harding told the audience that he had seen so much of interest that it would be absolutely impossible for him to do his subject justice in the length of time that he had in which to give his lecture. He was able only to touch upon the main facts—to tell only a bit about his stay in each place, but in the few short minutes which he spoke he gave his hearers, although they had expected a treat—pictures which they will not have duplicated unless they take such a trip as did he.

“I went to school for three months—six days a week,” said Dr. Harding. The tour was under the auspices of the University Bureau of Travel, which is organized to take abroad teachers and educators who were interested in learning more about the country, the people, the architecture, and the arts of Greece. University professors who are very much interested in both ancient and modern Grecian civilization were at the head of the tour, and in this way the members of the party were taken to the places of interest where they were able to learn most and see most instead of having to go undirected from place to place.

Unusually good descriptions were given of places visited. Especially Mars Hill and the spot where the Apostle Paul preached his Mars Hill sermon; the Prison of Socrates, the place where tradition holds was the death house of that great philosopher; and also the Plain of Marathon. This plain is the one which has seen so many of the tourists to Greece because it is the scene of the historic battle of Marathon.

After leaving America, the party took the following trip, seeing all of the interesting sights at each place. A week or ten days were sometimes spent at one place. The first stop was London; from London to Holland; from Holland to Paris; then to Switzerland; from Switzerland to Milan. The next place of interest was Venice, then down the Adriatic Sea to the coast of Greece. They landed at Patros and made a hurried trip to Olympia. The rest of the time was spent in and around Athens, studying the different forms of architecture, art, archaeology, and history in so far as it pertained to the subjects in which they were interested.

Due to the fact that a great many professors and their wives have just arrived and are now in the process of making themselves comfortable for the winter, the social life at Davidson has not begun in the true sense of the word.
