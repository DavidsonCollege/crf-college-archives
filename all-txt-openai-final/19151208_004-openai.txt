MRS. M. J. FLOW IS ACCIDENTALLY INJURED

Mrs. M. J. Flow was found in an unconscious condition in her home on Concord Street one day last week.
She had suffered a severe fall, in which the back of her head had struck. Although the outer skull was
unbroken, one of the delicate interior bones was fractured, which wounded the brain, and caused the blood to clot on
the spinal column. Mrs. Flow was carried to Charlotte on Friday, and an operation was performed. There is very slight
chance of her recovery. Mrs. Flow’s children, Drs. William and Frank Flow, of Kannapolis; Prof. C. B. Flowe, of Fayette,
Mo.; Lloyd Flow, of Derita; and Mrs. Easley, of Statesville, have been summoned to her bedside.

Y. M. C. A. MEETING.

On last Thursday night Mr. H. F. Beatty ('03) gave a very interesting talk on Cuba, where he has served
several years as a missionary. He first described the country, pointing out the most important places and mountains. He said
that they have been so crushed down by the Roman Catholic Church and Spain for centuries that there is hardly
aspark of manhood left in them. And yet, although Cuba is called a Roman Catholic country, only a very small
fraction of the people ever go to church and a still smaller fraction know or understand anything that they do.
He compared the Christian with the non-Christian and showed how Christianity was uplifting the people and influencing their lives for
good. He concluded with a plea for Cuba. He said that this country had been pitifully neglected by the church,
and that additional aid was needed to carry on the work that others had been forced to drop.

to their life work. Recently the men who are followers of the “elements,” “compounds” and “mixtures” through life have put
their heads together and have also organized. Officers have not been elected as yet, but will be at the next
meeting of the “chemists to be.”
