Davidsonian Staff Reports

The Davidson women’s tennis team turned in a pair of strong tournament showings during the last two weeks to cap off a busy fall season. The Wildcats dominated their own Davidson Tournament October 18-20 and then had several fine individual performances at the UNCC Tournament last weekend.

At the Davidson Tournament, East Tennessee State and Western Carolina of the Southern Conference and UNC-Greensboro could offer little challenge to the Wildcats. An abbreviated 6-2 victory over UNC-G, an 11-1 thumping of ETSU, and a 12-0 thrashing of WCU gave the team a cumulative record of 29-3. Even coach Caroline Brown-Price was surprised at the ease with which her team won its matches. “Literally, we dominated play, which was surprising,” she said. “But upon reflection, we really had improved that much,” Price added.

Price attributes that improvement to a competitive fall schedule, the effects of strength training under Beth Manson, and mental training.

The tournament the following week at UNCC featured some of the top teams in the Southeast, including top 20 team Kentucky. Once again, the team played to the top of its game. Said Price, “We had strong performances everywhere; there were no disappointments.”

Davidson #1 player Cyndi Hess won the 1st Flight Consolation Bracket. Her only loss of the tournament came to the eventual champion, an Estonian export playing for Virginia Commonwealth, and Hess was the only person to take a set from her. In Flight 2, freshman Kimberley Nance suffered a 3-set loss in the Consolation final, but played what Price called the best tennis of her young career. Freshman Rebecca Billingsley “dominated play” in Flight 4, taking the title with a 6-1, 6-1 whipping of her Furman opponent. In the Flight 4 Consolation, senior Mary Faith Mount emerged victorious with a 6-3, 6-1 win over her foe from UNCC. The doublesThe play also sparked praise from Price. She called the Davidson showing “the best doubles we’ve played, period” during her 8-year tenure as coach. Sophomores Tasha Ruth and Barbara Grooms made it to the Consolation Final of the First Flight before losing, and the entire team received acknowledgment from the other coaches and players for their fine play. Davidson’s fall season will conclude next weekend in individual competition at the Sectional Tournament at N.C. State. Sophomores Hess and Jennifer Beahm and freshman Kimberley Nance have been nominated to represent Davidson there.
