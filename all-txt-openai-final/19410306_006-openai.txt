CORNER

Dr. Williamson Speaks

With deputations to W. C., Converse, Winthrop, Queens, etc., lately we have been quite busy—but quite happily so! Many have asked what a deputation is—a good question because many fellows are interested in this kind of work and many would make good deputations easier and quicker. Webster says that a deputation is a delegation, and our delegations go to schools, churches, conferences, meetings, etc., to give programs, musical numbers, talks in general, and the like. If you've never been on such a trip, you have something to look forward to if you are interested.

Davis Thomas and Mack Bruce are busy at work with the Ping Pong Tournament, as well as those who are practicing up a bit for some stiff competition. I was so busy that I couldn't start it, but it promises to be interesting at the ending. Many have already signed up and things are in pretty good shape. A cup for the winner!

Two freshmen are really in our Reading room. Thanks to Jack Shelton and Ed Rhudy.

DEBATERS TO BE CHOSEN
(Continued from Page One)

The teams will meet in debate with colleges and universities. The teams have not yet been decided by the Forensic Council. Last year, they debated at Wake Forest, Richmond, University of Maryland, Rutgers University, Wesleyan University, University of South Carolina, College of Charleston, Georgia Tech, Birmingham-Southern, and the University of Alabama.

Three members of last year’s varsity debating team are back at Davidson this year: Barker, Bill Loftin, and Drury Thompson. Two alternates, Al Winn and John Farrior, are also back. Loftin also announced that the frosh debate trials will be held in a few weeks. Those members chosen for the varsity team will be judges for that event.

Spanish Fraternity Initiates Monday Night

Sigma Delta Pi, honorary Spanish fraternity, held its annual initiation of new members on Monday night. The new members were S. K. McAfee, H. Efird, Jr., J. R. Bryant, T. O. Moore, J. M. Parks, and R. L. Coppedge. These students have done exceptionally well in Spanish courses and have shown themselves to be interested in the language.

Before the initiation ceremony, the Spanish Club presented a program which consisted of two skits. The first was "En El Café," a short dialogue with Stuart Erskine and Don Caterson. The second one was "En El Restaurant," with actors Bill Lemmon and Burkhead Wayne.

FRESHMEN GROUPS MEET

The freshman groups, which are led by Shaw Smith and Eldridge Brown, held a social meeting at the “Y” reading room recently. Shaw's group met on Friday night, February 21, and Eldridge's group met on Tuesday night, February 25. Both meetings began at 9 o'clock.

Professor McGeachy, who is the advisor for Shaw's group, was present at their meeting, and Professor Bailey, faculty advisor, was present when Eldridge’s group met. Professors Hank Johnson and Carl Pritchett were guests at both meetings. The boys talked to the professors and to each other and discussed campus activities. Cokes were served during the meeting, which ended about 10:30 o'clock.

Shaw Smith expressed his hopes that all the other groups will have a social hour soon.

Dr. Williamson Discusses Fitness of the World As a Place In Which to Live

Dr. Williamson of the faculty gave a talk last Sunday at 10:15 in Phi Hall on “The Christian Religion.” The subject of his discussion was the Universality of the Christian Religion. Dr. Williamson opened his discussion with the question: “Can this world be a fit place to live in?” He stated that there were two types of chaos now existing in the world. On one hand, there is the material chaos which includes all types of violence such as private murder and kidnapping; social violence, such as that existing between capital and labor; national violence, such as violent revolutions, civil wars, and political assassinations of some of the nations of Europe and Asia; and international violence, such as the many wars, declared and undeclared; and hosts of other evils, such as poverty, insecurity, and starvation. On the other hand, he said there was the spiritual chaos arising through the failure of man-made “religions.” Communism, Socialism, Liberalism, Fascism, Capitalism, Democracy, and much of the organized traditional Christianity have all failed to make the world a fit place in which to live.

In citing the failure of Democracy, he brought out the idea that although Democracy has many good points, it has now been largely discredited. He said that it is now struggling to preserve its great values from the wreckage of its weaknesses. In citing the failure of organized traditional Christianity, he stated that such a failure has been brought about because Christianity has not been true to its name.

Dr. Williamson said there were a number of problems to be confronted in answering the first question. The immediate need, he declared, was to work out a just and lasting peace as well as a decent and practicable social order. Following this, he said, was the spiritual need, namely, to work out or find a common spiritual ground, that is not a blueprint, constitution, state, world-wide system or otherwise, but a standard of right and wrong, a yardstick for progress and regress, a source of inspiration and strength. Dr. Williamson stated that the Christian religion alone provides the necessary basis for making the world a fit place in which to live.

world. a fit place to live in. He said that it has a multiplicity of pathways or starting points which may be found by man. The first pathway is the law... On its lower level it was the easiest to understand. Then came its higher level, namely that life is improved by observance of the law both individually and socially. Finally came the highest level, namely seeing the Law-maker through his handiwork or law. Other paths that are of equal importance are faith, love, and truth. In closing he stated that Christianity alone is as broad as humanity and is not restricted to any one section or branch of humanity. All Non-Christian religions have “Isms” were discredited, their points, but are either marred by grave defects or too narrow in its geographic influence. He stated that Christianity has no such limitations. All types of people appreciate certain parts of the Bible.

Davidson chapter but every chapter in the country will be affected by the present war. Among the well-known brothers present at the banquet were Dr. Robert H. Lafferty, Mr. G. M. Ivey, Mr. W. H. Belk, Mr. Burton Smith, and Mr. Murry Atkins. Ross McElwee announced that at some time in April, the Pi K. A. National Headquarters will place a bronze plaque on the piano at the Pika house in commemoration of Bess Shields, who wrote “O Davidson,” and “The Dream Girl of Pi K. A.”

Brown, Louise Blue with Sandy McEachen, Mary Webster with Bill Summers, Alice Young with Jim White, Gloria Coppala with Russell Smith, and Dot Ballard with John Farrior.

The majority of the Spe’s spent a quiet weekend on the campus, but, as usual, there were several details made to far and near places. Brothers Bivens, Cobb, Brown, and Galbreath were in Raleigh during the weekend. Brother Brown reports the loss of coat and key in the capital city. MacDaniels, Tarleton, and Sell divided their time between G'boro and Burlington, and for a little variety, “Flagpole” Edmonson shot over to the Gate City. Brother Lanky Lawson Withers dashed up to the Twin City, and Brother (No-nox) Knox went south of the border. Brother P. G. Gwynn continued his weekly Saturday evening rural research amid the gaiety of Berryhill. Brother Pres. Watson (who isn't releasing much dope these days) made another debutation to Charlotte and conducted a private teachers’ meeting. Fulcher, Davis, and Behrmen were seen parked in the parlors of Burwell Hall and amid the life history files at Queens.

Company.
This is one of those pictures that is laid in a small town and everyone knows everybody in the town. The main idea is to show that often we move around to find a little better place and in the end we realize that our original home is the best and the early friends of life are often the best. This week I would like for Stewart Rogers to be the guest of the theater at any show for the coming week.
