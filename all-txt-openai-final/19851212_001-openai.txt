**Matlock discusses Soviet relations**

By DAVE WILLIAMS

Ambassador Jack Matlock Jr., senior director of European and Soviet Affairs for the National Security Council, spoke to Davidson students and faculty last night concerning the recent history of U.S.-Soviet relations and prospects for future relations in light of the recent Geneva summit. Matlock is President Reagan’s chief advisor on Soviet affairs and played a major role in preparing the Reagan administration for the summit as well as carrying out the agenda.

Matlock cited two reasons for the United States’ difficulty in maintaining a strong relationship with the Soviet Union: “There are extremely deep differences between our societies and interests which in some aspects cannot be bridged.” Also, “the Soviet Union is a country which... tends to define their security in ways so universal, it means insecurity for anyone else.”

In recent years a wide vacillation has occurred in U.S. policy to the Soviet Union, which “has greatly weakened our effectiveness in dealing with the Soviets,” Matlock said. “In the 1970s, we needed nothing so much as a steady policy which would stand the vicissitudes of Soviet action, so that we would not be thrown from the heights of euphoria to despair.”

Matlock pointed out several crucial problems encountered in dealing with the Soviet Union: “The irresponsible use of the Soviet military to achieve national ends outside the borders has made arms control quite difficult.” He emphasized that nuclear arms levels are much too high and that they need to be decreased, although “getting them down doesn’t achieve that much.” Matlock also cited a “total lack of trust and confidence in the relationship” as well as “a very little amount of interaction” between the two superpowers as hindrances to progress. These concerns have contributed to the final problem of achieving adequate compliance with agreements made between the two superpowers. Matlock said, “There have been times when agreements are virtually ignored [by the Soviet Union], particularly in their lack of regard for human rights.”

In planning the agenda for the recent Geneva summit, Matlock emphasized that the Reagan administration attempted to correct mistakes made at past summits. In the early 1970s, he said, Nixon and Brezhnev negotiated and signed nine or ten agreements. Nixon and Brezhnev loved the publicity, but the agreements were not adhered to in later years. “The facts are that agreements aren't negotiable at summits and shouldn’t be,” Matlock said.

Matlock said the real importance of holding summit meetings lies in “having the leaders of the only countries in the world that can destroy each other establish a relationship, so that in the future they can communicate rapidly and with understanding.”

Concerning the Geneva summit, Matlock said officials went into the meeting with a realistic view of what is possible. “I believe we achieved what we had hoped for. In a real sense, what (continued on page 7)

By ANDREA DIEDRICH

Several Davidson students met with a group of Queens College students to discuss stereotyping and poor social relations between the two colleges on Nov. 12 at Queens College. Davidson Assistant Dean of Students Harriette Root arranged the meeting with Queens Dean of Students Diana Williams after hearing several Davidson students and Davidson College Chaplain Charlie Summers express concern about relationships between Davidson students and women attending parties here.

Senior Melissa Jones, president of the Davidson Women’s Concerns Committee, attended the meeting. She said, “I was impressed with the [Queens] students I met. They were bright and articulate, and it was fun to meet with them.” Senior Union President Rob Vaughn also attended the meeting and said: “I was interested and impressed that two groups of women would get together to try and work out differences, when they didn’t absolutely have to be worked out. My impression is that if it were two groups of men, they probably wouldn't have tried.”

Queens SGA President Heidi Howell attended the meeting. “I was so pleased with the meeting,” she said. “I really appreciate the fact that Davidson students recognize the problem of stereotyping and are willing to do something about it.”

Jones felt two main goals were important results of the meeting. The first goal is to educate Queens women who attend parties at Davidson about the emergency services that exist here such as the Davidson Emergency Rescue Squad (DERS) and the Rape Crisis Center. This goal will be accomplished by distributing cards with Davidson emergency phone numbers on them to Queens students. The cards will also have phone numbers of Queens students who would be willing to pick up fellow students left at Davidson parties without rides home and possibly phone numbers of female Davidson students who would agree to let a stranded Queens student spend the night in their room.

The second goal is to prevent stereotyping by involving Queens students in activities other than Patterson Court activities. Jones said, “This goal is ambitious, but it is something worth working for.” As president of the WCC, Jones hopes to involve Queens women in planning and participating in the activities sponsored by her committee. Jones sees transportation as the biggest problem in involving Queens students in Davidson activities. Vaughn hopes to invite the Queens women to participate in the Short Courses sponsored by the Union that are held after Christmas break. Root said Queens women will be invited to participate in the sexuality seminar to be held in February. Howell also plans to invite Davidson students to activities at Queens.

Root said no definite plans have been made for another meeting between Queens and Davidson students. The other Davidson students who attended the meeting were DERS member Olivier van Dierdonck, Davidson Rape Crisis Melissa McLemore, and Patterson Court Council President Lisa McNeilly. Davidson Assistant Dean of Students Paula Miller and Mary Jo Clark, advisor of the Rape Crisis Center, also attended the meeting from Davidson.
