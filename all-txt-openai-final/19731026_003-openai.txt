Three Citizens Uproar Forces Drug Center Removal

John D. Allen, director of Open House (a federally-funded rehabilitation center for drug addicts), has withdrawn his request for permission to lease the vacant Ada Jenkins Elementary School. The school, which is located in the midst of the predominantly black residential Northwest section of Davidson, would have been used by Open House as a residence and treatment center for those enrolled in its various drug programs. The proposal to locate the center in town met with intense unified opposition from Davidson’s black community. This opposition was the major factor in causing Open House to withdraw its request. “If Open House had not withdrawn its request, the town board of Davidson would almost certainly have turned it down.”

Lilly, Professor For 40 Years, Renowned For Gentle Manner

“Henry T. Lilly was killed Thursday by a passing car as he was walking his dog near his home in Boone, N.C.” Those few lines sum up the end of the mortal life of Henry Lilly, but they say nothing about the man himself. And the man will live for years in the hearts of those he taught and those with whom he associated.

A member of Davidson’s class of '18, a professor of English at Davidson for 40 years, he began to instruct students in the ways of Shakespeare, Chaucer, Beowulf, and Alfred in 1926. A year later he was among the first to teach in the “new” Chambers Building and there he remained, in room 305, until he retired in 1965. From Davidson, he went to Appalachian State University in Boone to lecture in early English literature.

Lilly’s hobbies included Chaucer (his favorite) and collecting old versions of the New Testament. He was a man of great faith and he had a deep interest in its roots. Hundreds of his students will remember his courteous classroom manner. He would always address his students as being “gentlemen,” and each one as “Mister.” Lilly always presented a disheveled appearance in class, but he knew his material. And he expected his students to also know their stuff. His tests were long and hard, and there was much reading to be done for any of his classes. His pupils had an abundance of papers to turn in. One would-be scholar doubted that it was humanly possible to read them all and in the middle of one of them he inserted, “I’ll bet you didn’t read this, you old goat.” The student lost. When he received the paper back there was only one comment on it. Lilly had put at the end of it: “I’ll bet I did—F.”

Lilly had a fantastic memory of former pupils. He would write them letters congratulating them on successes in the adult world, long after they had left Davidson far behind. In one letter to a former student, he wrote, “If it is true that I have shown just one student that literature is a wonderful paradise of delight then my entire life of teaching is amply rewarded.” At one party he said, “The wisest thing I ever did was to persuade Mrs. Lilly to marry me.” He was married at the age of 47, in 1944.

On the wall of his room, he had this quote: “A wise, judicious, sagacious student will submit his term paper on the day it is due.” On the side of a 1968 letter to the Alumni Association, he had written, “Please excuse the inferior characteristics of this letter. I look upon a typewriter as an infernal machine from deepest Tartarus and distinctly a product of the malicious machinations of the Devil himself when he was in a particularly vicious mood. Please forgive the mistakes.”

James Purcell, Professor of English, said that this community will long remember Henry Lilly. “He was, first of all, a kind understanding person, and after that, a scholar of deep insight, but above all, a person of real humanity.” Thomas Rogerson, Professor of Spanish, was impressed with Lilly’s command of the English language. “He was aware that every time he wrote and spoke he was using the language of Shakespeare. Lilly would choose his words with care and he thought before he spoke at all times.”

Dean of Students Will H. Terry stressed the humility and politeness of his former Professor. “Henry Lilly understood perhaps more about what it meant to be human than any other teacher I ever had. He incorporated his humanity with his teaching, and his mind was brilliant without any trace of arrogance. We talk a lot about the Davidson College Christian commitment, and of our community. Henry Lilly had that commitment in a very non-verbal, profound way. He was the soul of gentleness.”

The body of Henry T. Lilly was buried last Sunday. But...His essence will never leave the campus he was associated with for more than half a century anyway,” said Davidson Mayor Thomas Sadler. “The people who live in the immediate neighborhood were very opposed to that thing being put there, and the town board is not going to do anything so many people oppose,” he added.

There are several prominent reasons for the location of the rehabilitation center in Davidson. Residents voiced fears that the location of the center in a residential neighborhood would tend to negate any efforts to upgrade that neighborhood. They also felt that the presence in the community of those undergoing treatment for drug addiction might make drugs more available to young adults in the community. However, the primary basis of opposition appeared to be a feeling among members of the black community that such a center would be something foreign to Davidson. They resented the “sale” of what they consider their school to outsiders. The general feeling is summed up in the words of one resident who said, “This center is going to serve mostly people from Charlotte. Why should it be located here?”

School board member Ms. Julia Maulden was one of the few members of the community to actively support the efforts of Open House to locate their center here. She said she was motivated by “humanitarian reasons.” “Men have to be helped by men,” she said. “This community owes it to their fellow man to extend a helping hand.”

Now that the proposal by Open House for lease of the Ada Jenkins School has been withdrawn, the future of the school is uncertain. Sadler described the building as being in “very good shape,” with excellent kitchen facilities and a gymnasium. Indications are that members of the community which surrounds the school may be very interested in converting the school into a community center. Sadler said that he expects the town board “would like to help them in this effort when a concrete proposal is made.”

The school has been vacant for the past three years, and the local school board, which presently owns the structure, is anxious to find what Maulden described as “a responsible tenant.” Allen has not been available for comment, but members of his staff said that they will continue to examine locations for their center, both within Charlotte where they presently are located, and in outlying areas. The Steele Creek High School south of Charlotte has apparently been given serious consideration.

### Otey Enthused About Vespers

The Christian commitment is alive and well at Davidson, at least if it is measured by the reception given the Tuesday night service of the Davidson College Presbyterian Church. The service, given each week at 7 p.m., is designed to be a supplement to the normal Sunday church activities.

“Since vespers were done away with there has been a kind of vacuum in religious life at Davidson,” explained the Rev. Rush Otey, the church’s minister to students. (Attendance at a Sunday-night vespers was required of Davidson students until 1966.) Otey feels that the service does much to fill this vacuum. “People have found it helpful just to come together as human beings,” he said.

Although he eschews any measurement of a religious program’s “success,” Otey nevertheless appears encouraged by the support shown for the service. He noted that the attendance of the meetings has grown from around 130 at the initial service on Sept. 11 to an average of over 200. “I’ve been very pleased at the response so far,” he said.

The services feature a different guest preacher each week, either from within the college, from a local church, or even from other states. A sampling of these guests includes Dr. Bob Palmer, Dean of Students Will H. Terry, Vice President for Academic Affairs John M. Bevan, the Rev. Russell Montfort of Dilworth United Methodist Church in Charlotte, and Joseph Roberts, Director of the Division of Corporate and Social Mission of the U.S. Presbyterian Church. All the guest preachers are of “very high quality,” Otey explained. He especially looks forward to next Tuesday’s visit by Roberts, whom Otey describes as an “outstanding” black religious leader. “This is one guy everyone would benefit from hearing,” he said.

Another area of church activity this year is volunteer ministry to inmates at the Huntersville prison unit. “We're working in various areas such as physical facilities, recreation, and work release,” commented Otey. The church is holding a study-orientation program to familiarize volunteers with various aspects of prison life.

Otey is also interested in contemporary issues. “I’m available for starting any kind of discussion group the students are interested in—ethical, religious, social,” he remarked. “The emphasis of the church is to be very open to students.”

### HEAVENLY HOTLINE
Rev. Rush Otey, the Davidson College Presbyterian Church's minister to students, is pleased with the Tuesday night worship services. Joseph Roberts, Director of the Division of Corporate and Social Mission of the U.S. Presbyterian Church and an “outstanding” black religious leader, is scheduled to speak soon.
