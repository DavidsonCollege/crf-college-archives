**Edmonds & Curley Team To Appear At Hungry I**

The first Hungry I Coffeehouse of the new year will open its doors Tuesday, January 13. The featured performers will
be a fast-rising new comedy team called Edmonds and Curley. They will appear twice nightly—at 8 and 9:15 Wednesday through
Saturday in the Morrison Room of the College Union. The pair will give a special “after-the-game” show Tuesday evening. Doors
will open at 10.

Edmonds and Curley do not deal with ethnic and rebellious social criticism as do many of their contemporaries; but seek
rather “to entertain and to enjoy every minute of it.” Some of their favorite routines include the neurosurgical techniques of
a mad doctor, a motorcycle hill climb race, and a parody of the late, late show. Edmonds is also an
experienced guitarist and singer.

According to junior Rob Krehbiel, co-director of the Hungry I along with Glenn Mauney, this will be the first comedy
team to appear at the coffeehouse for several years. “This will be an important experiment, and we are hoping that
Edmonds and Curley will be as popular as the more musically-oriented groups that we have brought to the coffeehouse,” Krehbiel
said.

Edmonds and Curley met in college at Oshkosh State in Wisconsin in 1962. Edmonds was an experienced guitarist and singer,
and Curley had worked weekends as a comedian. They worked together part-time there and as a result decided to form
a comedy team. In addition to the College Coffeehouse Circuit, they have recently performed at the Bitter End in New
York and at several clubs in the area.

**Little Anthony Is Due Midwinters**

By BILL DAVENPORT

The attraction at Davidson Midwinters this year will be Little Anthony and the Imperials. To appear at 8:00 p.m. Saturday,
January 31. Little Anthony is expected to please requests for more soul groups on the Union schedule. Though not headlining
at the present, the Imperials are authentic, non-derivative performers in the Smokey Robinson tradition.

**Dana Foundation Grants**

Davidson and Queens colleges have each received a Christmas gift of $100,000 from the Charles A. Dana Foundation. Since 1960-61
the foundation has provided financial aid and recognition for as many as 20 students each year in each of the
three upper classes at Davidson and Queens. In recent years that has amounted to some $40,000 annually to each institution.

“The investment income from the $100,000 gifts will provide each college at least $5,000 a year for the scholarships,” the
presidents of the two colleges noted in a joint statement. “We hope to add to the Dana Scholarship program funds
from other sources as well.”

Smylie and Spencer praised the foundation’s program of support to higher education as “one of the country’s finest. At both
Queens and Davidson it has provided generous subsidization for faculty salaries, substantial financial aid to deserving students, and thousands of
dollars in building programs as well.” The presidents estimated that the foundation has given Davidson some $3 million in the
last 15 years.

Dana Scholars are selected on the basis of academic proficiency, character and good citizenship, evidence of leadership potential, and effective
participation in the activities of the college community. At Davidson and Queens the actual amount of each grant depends primarily
on the student's financial need. The scholarships are not awarded to freshmen. But “if during his first year a student
proves that he has the qualities and abilities of a Dana Scholar, he will then be eligible for substantial scholarship
help in the form of a Dana Scholarship for his last three years in college.”

The Dana Foundation has also provided an endowment at both colleges for supplements to salaries of several professors. Gifts for
Davidson have included funds for the Dana Science Laboratories, Richardson Hall (a dormitory), renovation of the college union and cafeteria,
and the development of a recreation area on Lake Norman. At Queens funds have been used for the spacious Auditorium
in the new E. H. Little Fine Arts Center, the Dana Building (classroom), and to acquire property adjacent to the
campus.

**Little’s Gift Caps Fund Drive Effort**

E. H. Little gave Davidson College the deed to his family farm Saturday night, thus completing the College’s $2 million
fund-raising drive to build a new library. The deed was presented at a special dinner meeting of the College’s Board
of Visitors at 6 p.m., Saturday, Dec. 6, in the North Carolina National Bank Building in Charlotte.

According to Davidson President Samuel R. Spencer, Jr., Little challenged the College to raise $1,500,000, and promised to give the
College $500,000 to build the library if they succeeded. “We expect to have architects begin plans for the library in
the near future,” said President Spencer.

**Three Juniors Hobnob With Politicos On Washington Semester Program**

Three Davidson juniors will spend the next semester interviewing politicians and government employees in the nation’s capital as they participate
in the Washington Semester Program of The American University.

The main feature of their studies will be a special research project involving many hours of interviews and seminars with
public officials, political figures, lobbyists, and others active in the national government. The program affords the student “a realistic picture
of the processes of government, far richer in detail and more accurate than can be gained in an ordinary academic
environment,” according to a spokesman for the program.

The students participating are Hunter Dalton, Keith A. Onsdorff, and Michael R. Taylor. They were selected by the political science
department and by the faculty of the Washington Semester program. The Washington Semester is a cooperative arrangement between The American
University and several dozen colleges and universities across the country. In addition to credit received for the research project, participants
take several regular courses at the university, enabling them to gain other credits toward graduation.

The program is administered by the School of Government and Public Administration of the university, with a community advisory committee
of some 30 governmental, professional, and educational leaders of the Washington area. Classes will start Jan. 29 and run until
June.Chicago and Minneapolis — including the Chicago Playboy Club. They also have appeared on the Merv Griffin show and were
guests of Johnny Carson Wednesday. Robinson had many big hits in the Fifties, such as "Tears on My Pillow."

"We are trying to create an atmosphere in which the student can relax with a date," Krehbiel said. At this
date, the Union is also trying to book either My Mountain (a group similar to Led Zeppelin) or the Classics
IV. Other acts which are definitely scheduled include a performance of "Dracula" by the Red and Black Masquers in the
Morrison Room at 5:00 p.m. Saturday. The Storeybook People, a group which Tommy Smothers discovered and which is described as
resembling the Fifth Dimension, will be performing.

"The Cultural Crisis in the United States" will be discussed by the music critic of The Washington Post and author
of several books and articles in the field of music, Paul Hume. His talk on "The Cultural Crisis" will be
from 3:00 to 5:00 a.m. Sunday. Pervis Lee, a local folk singer with a growing reputation in Charlotte, will sing
at breakfasts to be held both Saturday and Sunday morning.

The coffeehouse, under the direction of C. Shaw Smith, began four years ago. Juniors Rob Krehbiel and Glenn Mauney are
nearing the end of their first year as directors of the Hungry I. The original circuit had only 16 participating
schools. The present circuit is run by the Bitter End and includes 140 schools.

"There was a motto on my office desk when I came in that said, 'Jean Paul Sartre isn't sensitive,'" recalled
Dr. George A. Buttrick to his class. "Now, true Sartre isn't as sensitive as some of the other existentialists, but
he certainly is, and we'll have to talk about him."

Hume has held his position with The Post since 1947. He has also been a professor of music and director
of the glee club and chorus of Georgetown University since 1950. He has been a visiting lecturer at Oberlin, Ripon,
and the University of Southern California. In addition, he has had a daily radio program on music in Washington, D.C.,
for over 20 years and has been a guest commentator for performances of the Metropolitan Opera and the New York
Philharmonic. He has written several books, including "Catholic Church Music," "The Lion of Poland," "The King of Song," and articles
for The Saturday Review and The Critic.

The Reynolds Lectures at Davidson are supported by the Reynolds Foundation. Other Reynolds Lectures this year will include Dean Rusk,
April 6-8, and C. Vann Woodward, historian and author, May 6-7. The E. H. Little Dormitory on the campus bears
his name, as will the new library. His gifts contributed significantly toward the construction of the Dana Science Building and
the Cunningham Fine Arts Center, Spencer added. Davidson College conferred on Little an honorary Doctor of Laws degree in 1953,
praising him for "administering the stewardship of money, not for personal prestige and power, but for the glory of God
and the relief of man’s estate."

BUTTRICK LEADS NEW RELIGION COURSE
Noted theologian draws large crowds for his talks. More than 70 students are taking Buttrick’s course.

Over seventy students, far more than expected, appeared in Perkins Auditorium Monday at noon for the first meeting of Religion
147, entitled "Biblical Thought and the Mind of Today." Buttrick is an internationally-known theologian, Biblical scholar, pastor, and teacher, who
is a visiting professor of religion at Davidson this term. Buttrick has told his class that their papers will involve
more than mere research. "I want you to do some thinking on your own," he said. Besides teaching the course,
Dr. Buttrick will be available for talks with students and faculty members and will preach occasionally, according to a college
spokesman. He and his wife live on the Davidson campus.

Born in England in 1892 and educated there, he was ordained in the Congregational Church, U.S.A., in 1915 and held
pastorates in Illinois, Vermont, and Buffalo, N.Y., before serving as pastor of the Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church in New York
City, 1927-54. During 1954-60 he was preacher to the university and Plummer Professor of Christian Morals at Harvard, and then
a visiting professor at Union Theological Seminary, New York, for a year. Since 1961 he has been professor of preaching
at Garrett Theological Seminary of Northwestern University in Evanston, IL. He has been a visiting lecturer or professor at several
other American colleges and universities and is a past president of the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America.
His books include "So We Believe, So We Pray" (1951); "Faith and Education" (1952); "Sermons Preached in a University Church"
(1959); "Biblical Thoughts and the Secular University" (1960); "Christ and History" (1963); and "God, Pain and Evil" (1966).
