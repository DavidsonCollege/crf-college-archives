CAT-TALES By TONI CASALI

When Doc Newton, former Davidson football coach, went to N.C. State two years ago, a rivalry between State and Davidson, termed by sports scribes as a “natural,” started. Doc took the first game last year by a 6-2 score and made it two straight last Saturday night. But Davidson will not be the only team to taste defeat from the hands of the Wolfpack this year, not by a long shot. Doc presented a fine array of talent—headed by brilliant Artie Rooney, elusive Andy Pavlovsky, and Ken Sands in the backfield, and a fine forward wall led by big, bruising, “Ty” Coon. The Wolves were just too powerful, too shifty, for the Wildcats. No team can be ashamed of a defeat from the hands of Doc Newton's forces. The Wildcats, however, gave a good account of themselves before the night was over. Although their defense looked rather ragged during the first half and the offense just couldn't seem to get started, they came back at the beginning of the second half and in SEVEN plays rushed over a touchdown. Four of these seven plays were passes, three of them runs. The climax was a pass, Davis to Stair, who incidentally made a beautiful catch of the ball and was injured after he had scored. That spurt of offense proved that the Wildcats had something. Later they threatened the Wolf goal again, after a brilliant 31-yard run by Davis and some nice blocking by the entire team, but the Wolf line, headed by the ever-alert Coon, withstood the attack.

DAVIDSON vs. DUKE

Davidson plays her BIG game of the year next Saturday against Duke. It’s been a long time since the Wildcats won from the Blue Devils, the last time being in 1929 by a 13-12 score. In 1931 the teams battled to a scoreless deadlock. Since then the ‘Cats haven't been able to come out on top, but some of the best games put up by the Wildcats were against the Dukes. In Greensboro, Mr. Ace Parker led Duke to a 13-0 victory. Last year, Davidson's chances of victory over Duke are negligible, but her passing attack may make an impressive showing. Offensively and defensively—wait and see. Archie Steed, whose eligibility was questioned at the beginning of the season, is now in good standing. His presence will bolster the Cat attack considerably. He will be ready to step in and aid Bill Davis with his running, passing, and punting chores—giving Davis time for a much-needed rest—something that the Wildcats have had to do without during the past. Bill Bolin and Bob McClellan, along with Bill Beaty, give the backfield plenty of blocking power. This is the first year in a long while that the Wildcat backfield has had a trio of excellent blockers. McClellan is the unsung hero, however. In both games to date, he has confined his duties to backing up the line and blocking, and has not carried the pigskin a single time. He played the best game of a fine career in the Citadel game. Fred Stair rounds out the backfield and does his duty well.

Head Coach Gene McEver will be giving his boys plenty of defensive drills in preparation for the Duke offense. If Handsome Dave Warden and his other line-mates are right, Davidson should give the Dukes a fit.

SOCCER—A NEW SPORT

A sport that is growing each day in popularity on the campus is soccer. The team has been somewhat overlooked, however, during the past. For the past three years they have been seeking recognition from the Athletic Council, but so far nothing has been done due to the lack of funds, inadequate coaching facilities, and even without the guidance of a coach, the team has had successful seasons. Practice for the coming season has begun, and in the coming weeks the squad will meet such teams as Duke, Clemson, N.C. State, Furman, and others. If you really want to enjoy an evening, just go out and see this ancient sport being played. Twenty-six men have reported to Captain and Coach O.V. Armstrong, and most of the boys have had experience in the game. Let’s get out and back them.

INTRAMURALS

Davidson has one of the best intramural programs that can be found anywhere in the south, due to the efforts of Intramural Director Pete Whittle. Interclass football was started Monday with the seniors romping roughshod over the freshmen. The seniors started their winning plays when they were sophomores and have continued to do so each year. Although the intramural program is popular, there could still be plenty of added interest shown. If each class would get as many boys as possible out for the teams, and the rest of the class out cheering them on, it would improve matters considerably, and maybe that winning streak of the seniors could be stopped. They have been boasting of it long enough.

Finally, a heave to Bill Marquess connected, and he outran several freshman backs to score the first touchdown of the year. The Frosh attack could not get moving, and the half ended with the score 6-0. Again in the second half, the Seniors started on a touchdown drive that could not be stopped, and it was climaxed when Marquess reached high into the air for one of Charlie Sample's passes and took it across, aided by Pittman’s fine blocking. A safety and another touchdown pass, Johnson to Sample, brought the score to 20-0. Yarborough to Sink was the main Frosh threat.

1938 THE DAVIDSONIAN

WILDCAT TEAM POINTS FOR ANNUAL CLASH WITH DUKES

Page Four

Tennessee Captain Dave Warden and Fred Stair are two sons of Tennessee on the Wildcat team this year that are ably upholding their native state’s tradition for great athletes at Davidson. Warden is playing his third year of varsity tackle and is a letterman at halfback. He played a courageous game against State and scored his team’s lone tally on a pass.

Wolfpack Victorious As Davidson Suffers Initial Big Five Loss

Pavlovsky Overshadows Rooney and Sands as N. C. State Wolfpack Opens Big Five Schedule With Win Over Wildcats — Stair and Davis Star

By BOB WILLIAMS

The State Wolfpack issued a roaring challenge to all of its Southern Conference competition last Saturday night by trouncing a valiant bunch of Davidson Wildcats by the score of 19 to 7 in the Memorial Stadium in Charlotte. The devastating running of big Andy Pavlovsky paced the attack for the powerful State team, and Bill Davis again proved to be the spearhead of the Davidson attack.

Powerful State

Soccer Draws Twenty-Eight

From the very first whistle, the powerful State attack could not be denied results, and although the ‘Cats put up a very stubborn resistance, the gaping holes in their line were the targets for the hard-running State backs. During the first half, these backs pounded the center of Davidson to pieces, but the Wildcats came back true to style in the second half and played the Wolfpack to a standstill.

State took the opening kickoff to their 45-yard line, and on the next play, Pavlovsky ran over left guard for 15 yards. Then only seven plays later, Sands hit the center for a touchdown, and Sabolyk converted for the extra point. State continually had the edge in the first quarter, and at the beginning of the second quarter, a pass from DiYeso to Traylor scored again, making it 13-0. Lozier intercepted a pass from Archie Steed, intended for Ned Iverson, and ran it to the Davidson 10; but another intercepted pass by Frankie Harrison over the goal gave the ‘Cats the ball on the 20, and several plays later, the half ended.

An entirely different Davidson team took the field the second half, and after receiving the kickoff, Bill Davis threw a pass to Fred Stair and a 15-yard penalty against State for roughness put the ball on the State 20. Two plays later, Davis hurled a pass to Bob Benfield to the 11, and after running to the 6, he again threw a pass to Stair who caught it on the 4 and carried it over the goal. Davis’ pass to Benfield was good for the extra point.

However, the Wildcat cheers had hardly died down before the Wolfpack was again hammering at touchdown’s door, and the fight of the Wildcat line could not match the blocking of State’s line and the power running of her big backs. And so after a drive all the way down the field, Rooney carried the ball over the goal from the 3-yard line. The score then stood 19-7, and it looked as if it would be changed again a few minutes later when Pavlovsky ran through the Davidson team to the 2-yard line.

The Big Five and Southern Conference achieved their victory in the second half by sheer manpower. The count was 14-6. Duke walloped Virginia Poly 18-0 in a night game in Greensboro with comparative ease. Bob O'Mara, big Blue Devil fullback, scored twice to lead his team’s offensive play. Several Duke sophomores looked promising as reserves.

State overpowered Davidson to round out the Big Five clashes. The game drew 13,000 people under the arcs at the Legion Memorial Stadium in Charlotte. The Wolfpack’s backfield power was impressive as were her linemen in their blocking. Davidson's passing attack, featuring short bullet passes from the arm of Bill Davis, clicked well if briefly in the third period in spite of the fact that the passer was getting little protection. The final score was 19-7, the Wildcats tallying on a short pass, Davis to Stair, in the third quarter.

Although it appears now that Duke and Carolina will fight it out for the Big Five crown, both State and Wake Forest loom as potential giant-killers as they go into their second season under new coaches.

The Worst a man can hear about himself will benefit him most.

The dimmest lights have the most scandal power.
