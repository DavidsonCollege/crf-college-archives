Church Holds Camp

Portrait of Harding Received By College

(Continued from Page Four)

During the past summer months, the Davidson Union Church sponsored many interesting activities. For the first two weeks in June, Bible Classes met and singing school was held each night. The singing school, incidentally, was the first ever to be held in Davidson. The biggest event of the season was the summer camp at Harris Lake.

For those who wish to see it, the portrait of Dr. Harding, Greek and Fine Arts professor, has arrived and rests temporarily in the Alumni office. Given by the graduating class of '38, it was painted by Eugene Thomason, an alumnus of Davidson.

Bulwarks in the State lineup are Bill Retter, star center, and Ed Coon, aggressive tackle. Eddie "Buzzer" Berlinski, an All-State halfback and sparkplug of the Wolfpack last year. Whether or not Rooney can fill this great little back’s shoes will be seen.Largely due and ‘i ie ity; ware ae ' 1 lect! ¢.
