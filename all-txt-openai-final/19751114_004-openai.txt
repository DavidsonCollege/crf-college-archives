**Faculty Secrecy: Promoting Student Ignorance**

The Davidsonian, November 14, 1975

The faculty vote this week disallowing extended studies courses to be used to fulfill area requirements calls attention to unprofessional
and irresponsible means of conducting faculty business. Faculty members maintained that their vote upheld policy set in a faculty meeting
in March 1970. Because the faculty has insisted upon keeping its meetings as well as official minutes closed to other
members of the college community, academic policies can be set without the knowledge of students who must abide by them.
Such procedures for conducting business are not only unjust but entirely unnecessary.

We call for an immediate examination of the minutes of the meetings to ensure that all policy statements are recorded
in the college registry. Secondly, we call upon the faculty to open the minutes of their meetings to the public.
Because academic policy is set by the faculty, the policy statement and records of the proceedings must be available to
the entire college community. Present means of operation seem not only to invite students to examine the minutes but require
them to do so if they are to know what policies they are to abide by. The secrecy which now
surrounds faculty meetings simply promotes ignorance on the part of students in regard to academic regulations. We would think that
the “promotion of ignorance” runs contrary to the purpose of the faculty. We urge the faculty to clear the records
immediately.

The Puritans banned all fictional literature because to them it was composed only of lies. What they failed to appreciate
is that there is more than one kind of truth. Good literature conveys a level of truth about men, what
they are, and what they believe, which often cannot be said in any other way. And so it is with
good drama. There were historical inaccuracies in the “Wilson” production. The playwright was aware of them all. The director and
cast were aware of them. The inaccuracies did not bother us because we were more concerned with communicating a larger
message: a sense of what the man Wilson was and believed. This I think we tried to do with an
uncompromising fidelity, while at the same time accepting the limits of time and medium. But when performing in an academic
community, criticism regarding the historical inaccuracies is to be expected.

Bill Link’s review of the play which appeared last week was perceptive and helpful in spots, but was unclear as
to exactly where he stood. It did make me suspect, however, that there is a Puritan or two back there
in the Link lineage somewhere.

**Questioning Responsibilities**

(Continued from page 1)

More significant, however, is the fact that the majority of Davidson women do not really know what femininity is. One
woman’s response to the question was, “Oh Lordy gracious me alive!” She sums up the confusion many feel inside. Others
responded with similar attitudes. “I don’t know. It’s a fight in my own mind.” “I don’t know, but I know
what it is not feminine.” “Femininity is the opposite of masculinity.”"Nothing comes to mind."

The Davidson woman no longer fits into society's mold which has told her that, as Dr. Horner says, "It isn’t
lady-like to be too intelligent." On the other hand, she wants to fit into that role and feels slightly guilty,
slightly abnormal if she does not. Horner says that the intelligent woman feels that "if she fails, she is not
living up to her own standards of performance; if she succeeds, she is not living up to societal expectations about
the female role."

"We have been robbed of our femininity," said one Davidson woman. "We no longer know what femininity is." "True femininity,"
as one woman put it, "isn’t outward. It is being in touch with what you are. It is an essential
part of human personal development. It is what makes one unique." It can be the acceptance of oneself as an
individual who happens to be female; womanhood is just as essential a characteristic as eye color. This acceptance naturally reflects
itself in a person’s outward appearance. One woman stated simply that, "Femininity is first being a person and second having
a certain air about you that there’s no question in anyone's mind that you are a woman... and that’s special."

One manifestation of the "femininity crisis" is women’s feelings about competition. Most of the women interviewed admitted that they compete
more easily with women than with men. They feel freer to be aggressive in a group of women than they
do in a group of men. "We've all been socialized to be less aggressive. Sometimes I just give in." "I
sometimes play dumber than I am... but I don’t like it." Some feel that while they are very competitive, they
don’t like to be.

Letters to the Editor

Roylance questions puritanical criticisms

To the Editor:

Little did I know how accommodating people are at Davidson. My note of "thanks" for the right to be nauseated
was answered, as if religiously, by the seemingly miraculous appearance of yet a second dumpster between Richards and Bailey, placed
so that the shortest distance to get to the Patterson Court path is to walk between the two. Doesn't that
just tickle your insides? It sure tickles mine, almost enough to cause it to eject the meal I have just
eaten.

I can think of only two reasons for this addition of insult to injury. Either whoever is in charge of
the dumpsters doesn’t read The Davidsonian or he just doesn’t give a damn. Either reason is pretty sad. Is it
too much to ask, to not have to be made nauseous four times a day with no reason? Even Ron
Scott, who benefits the most by their position, wants to see them moved. The placing of the dumpsters as they
are now is not only unnecessary and unsanitary, but downright asinine.

To the Editor:

It shouldn’t really surprise anybody that the Davidson coeds won that debate tournament recently. After all, it would be harder
to find a bunch of people who can talk so much without really saying anything—which is what debating is all
about. I know of several that get in enough practice just in the library to prepare for the national championship.
I think that in recognition of this achievement the rest of the college ought to take up a collection to
send as many of them as possible to the International Forensics Conference in Nairobi. Not only would it bring the
college a lot of recognition, but it would sure make things a lot nicer for everybody that’s left.
