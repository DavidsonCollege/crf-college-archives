### Humes Is Hurting

It’s hard to quantify learning in monetary terms, but if there is a program at Davidson worth spending a little extra money on to maintain its excellence, it is Humes. Students and faculty have consistently praised Humes since its inception. But staffing problems threaten to make that praise a little fainter.

The Humanities Program, in conjunction with Vice President for Academic Affairs Price Zimmerman, is looking for ways to accommodate all the freshmen who are taking the course this fall. The department is teaching eight sections of first-year Humes but only has six professors lined up to continue teaching the course winter term.

This short-term problem points to some long-range trends which may be endangering the quality of the Humanities program:

- Many of the professors who began the program 18 years ago have retired or left. The College is using untenured faculty members to replace the retirees. But young professors are not in a good position to take on such a time-consuming course. In addition to their Humanities responsibilities, the professors must worry about publishing articles in their field in order to succeed in their tenure bids and to keep themselves marketable should they choose to leave Davidson. Young professors must also plan their new courses for the first time, also a very time-consuming chore. Most institutions seeking new faculty members give more weight to teaching and publication in a professor’s specialty than to experience in interdisciplinary courses such as Humes. Many professors worry that the administration gives too much weight to publication when evaluating faculty members for tenure and contract renewal and simultaneously pays little attention to a professor’s teaching performance in Humanities. First-year Humes chairperson Daniel Rhodes told The Davidsonian that the administration has not systematically solicited his opinion on the performance of his Humes instructors; second-year chairman Sam Maloney said the administration has regularly contacted him when evaluating his charges. Because the administration's emphasis on Humes teaching performance in contract decisions has been inconsistent, professors tend to shy away from teaching Humes.

- Course registration continues to be a problem for many students, and with good reason. Several departments are short a professor or two, and enrollment seems to be slowly rising. Increasing student demand for Humanities doesn’t help the situation either, since moving a professor from teaching a regular course with a ceiling of 30 to a Humanities section of 18 people leaves 12 students out in the cold. Several members rightly feel that even a Humanities ceiling of 18 per section is too high.

There seem to be only two possible solutions to the short-term Humes staffing problem: hire interim professors or attempt to persuade present faculty members to drop a course in their department to teach a section of Humes. The first option is by far the more inviting, particularly since Dr. Zimmerman seems to think the money would be available. Using present faculty members would simply aggravate registration problems and likely result in a disproportionately large workload for a professor. The administration should probably employ a similar strategy in order to avoid long-term issues. If the administration hires new faculty to teach Humes, Humes professors could take sabbaticals a little more often than those who do not teach Humes, allowing the Humes professors to publish and keep up to date in their field. Course registration would also improve since the newly hired professors would teach other subjects as well. The Humes faculty might even be able to concentrate on teaching instead of the College’s course registration problems.

#### Hit And Run

To The Editor:

Davidson College is a place of trust. The students act according to a system of honor. This system works because the students pledge they will not violate it, and if they observe another student violating it they will be obligated to report him to the appropriate authority.

I write this to remind the student involved in an automobile accident that occurred on campus this past weekend of his/her obligation. The details of the accident are hardly needed, but I will state that while backing out of a parking space the aforementioned student’s car hit the side of a black Volkswagen Scirocco. To my surprise, the student who caused the accident drove away without writing a note.A message to the owner of the Scirocco: For the Honor System to work at Davidson, this student should turn himself in to Dean of Students Will Terry, or else I will be obligated to take further action myself.

Talk To Trustees
To the Editor:

As a result of the recent Trustee visit on October 3rd, misconceptions concerning the student-Trustee relationship were again unearthed. Many students feel that while the Trustees are intimately involved in decisions concerning the College, they are aloof from or insensitive to the real needs of the campus. This opinion is erroneous. The Trustees do believe student input is of utmost importance and they actively seek it. One-on-one meetings with the students during Trustee weekends are not only encouraged but emphasized as imperative in striving at policy-making decisions.

Dean Rusk, Trustee and former U.S. Secretary of State, comments: “I am particularly pleased that the after-dinner discussions between students and Trustees seem to be productive. In general, my experience has been that when people get together to try to find a common basis of fact, many of the first-look policy questions become easily resolved.”

Student input is not only stressed on Trustee weekends but on a continuing basis throughout the year. Dr. Fred Stair, newly-elected Trustee chairperson, encourages student-Trustee communications: “You (the students) are greatly to be commended for...the communication with the Trustees...” And Graeme Keith, Trustee and Chairperson of the Development Committee for the 1987 Program, comments in a letter to a student contact: “Your letter provided an excellent overview of what is happening at Davidson and I sincerely appreciate your taking the time to bring me up to date on both student and faculty viewpoints on various matters. I am particularly interested in your comments concerning fundraising and the future of athletics at Davidson.”

The Trustees wish to know our views, they care that our voices are heard, and are willing to act upon this input whenever possible. Many channels do exist to the Trustees. The Trustee Contact Committee, a campus-wide organization, was formed to provide direct, personal links with the Trustees. Through this committee, our viewpoints are heard and are seriously considered. If anyone is interested in writing to a Trustee on a regular basis, please feel free to get in touch with me.

No Offense
To the Editor:

In an American court of law, one is assumed innocent until proven guilty. Unfortunately, in the court of public opinion, one is charged, tried, convicted, and punished without the benefit of a hearing.

John Siman’s letter (The Davidsonian, Oct. 10) concerning ATO’s treatment of its Trustee guests presents an incomplete account of what happened. Yes, the stereo was playing DEVO when the Trustees entered; however, it was not mentioned that the music was turned down to a whisper two minutes later. Yes, napkins were thrown at one of the Trustees and his wife. Considering that they were sitting at a corner table, facing the corner, John’s ability to see that “they were obviously offended” by watching the backs of their heads is rather commendable. I was sitting at the same table with a Trustee and didn’t see “offensive” in either his or his wife’s face. Furthermore, it was explained to them that the napkins were our traditional welcome, and that we treated all guests similarly.

Finally, as regards students' input with the Trustees, I agree with Mr. Siman: students should take advantage of their (See Forum, page 10)
