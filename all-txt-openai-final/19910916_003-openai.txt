Campus Crime

By Tom Price
Bicycle theft has already become a major problem at Davidson this year, and campus police are urging students to lock their bicycles. Ray Thrower, Director of Public Safety and Police, says it is important to “encourage people to register their bicycles and encourage them to buy the horseshoe locks.” Ray "horseshoe" locks are sold in the college bookstore at cost. 19 bicycles have been stolen since school started, and the vast majority of these were unregistered and unlocked. Although no one has been apprehended, Thrower is encouraging students to continue to report any thefts on campus.

So far, only 217 bikes have been registered with the police. This is a simple procedure that costs nothing and may eventually help in the recovery process of a stolen bike. Police have been periodically registering bikes at different spots around campus, such as at the senior apartments and outside the Union. Registration may also be done at the police station.
