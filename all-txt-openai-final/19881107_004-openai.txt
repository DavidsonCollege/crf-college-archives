**‘Every trumpet player’s god”**

By VIRGINIA MISCHEN

By sheer luck, Davidson hooked one of the world’s most renowned musicians for a major concert last Saturday night. Union concert committee chairman Matt Terrell said that Wynton Marsalis “fell right into our laps.”

“We were aiming for his brother Branford, a saxophonist. Then our booking agent told us that Wynton had a few nights off between dates and wanted to play another concert. He offered us a price, and we booked him.”

The Wall Street Journal calls Marsalis “the most self-disciplined jazzman in the history of that volcanic art.” Freshman trumpeter John Burns says he is “every trumpet player’s god.” With a resumé that includes study at the Julliard School, five albums, and six Grammy awards, Marsalis is considered by experts to be the greatest trumpet player in the world.

Terrell took some informal student surveys before he decided to book Marsalis. The response was extremely enthusiastic. Terrell was pleased because, as concert chairman, he wants to bring different kinds of acts to the campus. “Davidson hasn’t had much exposure to jazz,” he said.

The concert committee works through a booking agent in Charlotte to get major acts like Marsalis to perform here. Union program coordinator Ruth Pittard said, “Agents like Davidson because we treat artists well. Responsive audiences attend our concerts, and we have the ability to arrange dates in a limited amount of time. Therefore, we can usually negotiate to get someone for the least possible amount of money.”

Pittard was excited about the Marsalis concert but is disappointed that Davidson is unable to attract such a major act more often. “Artists used to want to play at colleges first, so we used to attract the big musicians. We even turned down Simon and Garfunkel before they became famous because we didn’t think they were good enough! Now artists want to start at the top—clubs and big universities. They demand more money than we can afford to pay.”

According to Terrell, Marsalis is definitely the biggest name to come to Davidson in the past few years.

**Habitat for Humanity project rises up in Davidson**

By TRENT STEVENS

Canned goods and turkeys are some of the charitable contributions that have been distributed to Davidson’s poor families in the past. But how would you like to work with families to build their own houses? Davidson Habitat for Humanity is doing just that on Potts Street.

The Davidson project started a few years ago when a steering committee was formed to determine if there was a need for low-cost housing in Davidson. When the need was discovered, the committee tried to become an affiliate of International Habitat for Humanity, an Americus, Georgia-based organization founded by former businessman Millard Fuller. However, the organization felt that Davidson was too small and that there was neither enough poverty nor enough wealth to sustain a project here.

So the committee decided to start its own project, but it also planned to follow the same general guidelines of the Americus organization. Fundraising attempts brought in enough money to purchase enough land for eleven housing plots.

This tenacity apparently paid off, because according to Ken Wood, Careers Office Director and vice-president of Davidson Habitat for Humanity’s volunteer board of directors, “We got the attention of Americus. Americus came back and said, ‘Maybe you folks are special. We'll make an exception for Davidson and we’d like to have you.’”

Although Davidson officially became an affiliate last May, the project remains independently controlled and funded. The Davidson Habitat for Humanity is funded in several ways. Each family, which must be approved by a selection committee to receive Habitat housing, receives an interest-free mortgage for roughly $30,000 that is repaid in monthly installments of under $200 each. Each family that receives a house is required to put in 200 hours of “sweat equity”: 100 hours of work on their own house and 100 hours of work on another family’s house. The money received from the families is used to build other Habitat houses, and ten percent of the money raised goes toward a Habitat for Humanity housing development in Guatemala, where one house is built for every one built here. Outside donations of materials and funds cover some of the other expenses.

Caroline Craig, who is the college’s service coordinator and the Davidson Habitat’s volunteer coordinator, serves as the chief organizer of the Habitat’s volunteer activities, which are free. She says that “Habitat for Humanity has been chosen as one of two (programs affiliated with the college) for this year. That means...”that it has official status as a project that members of the college community will participate in and volunteer in as much as possible, and that I will invest a significant amount of my time as an employee of the college to facilitate that volunteer effort.” To those who are most dedicated to the project, perhaps the most striking thing about it is the cooperation and fellowship of all involved. Political science professor Tom Kazee says, “It’s time-consuming, but of all the things around town that I might have gotten involved in, in terms of community service, this is about as rewarding as it gets.”

Verdie Barringer says that “if you go in with a smile on your face, people start wanting to have a smile on their face.” The comment is typical—it’s her attitude towards life. Anytime you see her around the Union, she has a big grin on her face. Barringer sees her job not just as keeping the Union clean, but also as a chance to get to know students. She approaches them with a pleasant comment and asks about their majors to get them to tell her about themselves. She said one of the reasons she works at the Union is that it gives her the chance to talk. “That’s why I like cleaning; it gives me close contact, working with people.” She especially likes to hear about other places and other experiences. “I would love to go all over the world. I like to hear students talk about all the different places they’ve been—it’s just amazing.”

She has a sincere respect for Davidson students. “Not one of the students has shown me that they’re not adults.” There are things students can do to make her job easier, however. “During the night, they could pick up their cans and trays, and put them in the proper places. And the marks on the wall—you only find small children doing things like that. But I guess everyone gets depressed sometimes. Depression can put you out of focus right quickly. If you try to keep things clean, though, people will see it and try to follow your example.”

One of the reasons Barringer identifies with students so well is that she has been a college student herself. She studied at N.C. State for two years. To pay for her education, she worked in a restaurant annex, its hours being the only ones that fit into her schedule. Now that she has a family and it is her first priority, she isn’t interested in continuing her education right away. “I’m not ready to go back to school. The timing isn’t right. I’ve gathered a lot of information by not going back to school.”

Although it is hard for her to manage having a family and a job, Barringer enjoys it. “When I get up early in the morning, I have to keep stress and depression away. I’ve got three little ones and two teenagers, and I try to put forth the effort to make their days a little brighter.” But she emphasizes discipline, too. “As a career woman, you have to lay down laws along with the man of the house to make decisions.”

Barringer thinks spending time away from the children is good both for herself and for their sense of independence. “We all get a little tired of hearing the baby cry. An outing now and then is good. Sometimes for about two hours you need to get away from the baby and relax. Otherwise, the only thing the baby sees is herself, and when she gets older and goes out into the world that attitude can cause an awful lot of problems.”

Barringer is a giving person, and strong at the same time. “I think the staff is here to serve people. The customer is always right, and students are my customers. I don’t want them to take advantage of me, though.” Her kindness is illustrated by the way she responds to people in trouble. She says that things usually work out well. She describes a trip back from a previous assembly-line job: “It was marvelous—friendly back roads with cows passing in front of the car. Being a woman, I know I shouldn’t take chances, stranded so far away.

“But there was this one time when I saw a lady with a little baby, and her car had stopped. She had been walking along the highway for about a half a mile and I picked her up. I wouldn’t have done it normally, but something said go ahead—well, it turns out that some of my people knew her.”
