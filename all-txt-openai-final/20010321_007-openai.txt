Maria Irene Fornes’ play, entitled *Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas*, runs through Sunday in the Black Box Theatre.

**COLLEGE COMMUNICATIONS**

The Davidson College theatre department presents a new work by noted off-Broadway playwright Maria Irene Fornes tonight through Sunday. The production, based on Gertrude Stein’s *Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas*, begins at 7:30 p.m. each night, but at 2 p.m. on Sunday, in the Black Box Theater of Cunningham Fine Arts Building. Tickets are $4 for general admission. Fornes, whose work has been recognized with nine Obie Awards—off-Broadway theater’s equivalent to the Tony—is teaching two classes at Davidson this semester as the college’s McGee Professor of Writing.

Fornes’ adaptation of *Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas* is a montage of scenes that offer a beautiful and touching look into the relationship between Stein and Toklas while they lived together in Paris in the early years of the twentieth century. Directed by Fornes, the production will feature seniors Andra Whitt as Alice Toklas, Erin Smith as Gertrude Stein, freshman Cahit Ece as Pablo Picasso, and junior Melanie Wadkins as Helene. For reservations, call 894-2340 from 2-5 p.m. starting March 14.

Despite her many awards, a long career, and continued success as playwright and director, Fornes is relatively unknown to mainstream theater audiences. Many in the off-Broadway theater world consider her the industry’s “best kept secret.” Critic Bonnie Marranca has said, “Working for more than twenty years in off-Broadway’s unheralded spaces, Fornes is an exemplary artist who, through her writing and teaching, has created a life in the theater away from the crass hype that attends many lesser beings.”

Born in Havana, Fornes came to the United States in 1945 at the age of fifteen, and began drawing and painting in the mid-fifties. After a sojourn in Paris, she returned to New York in 1957. Her first play, *Tango Palace*, premiered off-Broadway in 1961. She has written...

**Dance Ensemble speaks in phrases we understand**

If dance is a universal language, then this spring’s Dance Ensemble performance was a concert of many voices sounding out their unique messages. From the strung-out tumble and rise of tap to the glide and swell of ballet, this spring’s performance pushed the language of dance into communicating a range of experiences. I have watched dance at Davidson evolve into the aspirations set by its members three years ago, and this spring’s concert was the most multivocal I have seen yet. It combined the efforts of long-time ensemble members and newcomers alike, evidencing the continued growth of the group and dance at Davidson.

The performance opened with the tap piece “Stuff Like That There,” and, as is characteristic of tap dance, did not whisper but shouted out its opening message. There is always something of the spectacular in tap, not in the pejorative Aristotelian sense, but in the dazzling confluence of music and movement, character and costume. Tap embraces that visual dazzle in the movement of the dancers’ feet across the floor. The “Stuff Like That There,” choreographed by Katherine Costa, was a celebration and declamation of the shine and zest that the dancer in movement can communicate. The stuff that was there, quite simply, shimmered and exclaimed.

Juxtaposed against “Stuff Like That There” was Rachel May’s ballet piece, “In The Wind.” Set to the music of *Forrest Gump*, the piece’s title evokes the image of the leaf from the film, dancing out its life on the motion of the wind. I saw both the Friday and Saturday performances, and, on Saturday, was shocked out of my normal ways of watching dance by the overall picture the dancers’ movements created. The most dramatic moment of this piece, for me, occurred as the dancers, divided into two lines, moved back and forth across the stage, with the two lines meeting at the middle, and becoming, for an instant, a stretching out of blueness and movement. At this moment, it was almost as if there were two leaves (to use the film’s imagery), and not one, and that these two were dancing back and forth past one another, around one another, and through one another, borne upon a wind washing left and right like the rise and fall of a wave.

“Will I?”, the performance’s third piece, choreographed by Clinton Rickards, took the power of dance to express the personal and imbedded it within the power of dance to express human questioning and interaction. The dancers began in their own individual poses, but, as the dance progressed, came together in the same movements, only to finish again in their unique expressions. The song, “Will I?”, from *RENT*, questions the possibility of connection, and in the cohering of movement by Rickards, Joe O’Brien, and Susan Robison there was hope for caring, compassion, and connection within uniqueness, along with an acknowledgment that underneath the questions we try to answer together are our personal questions, and to them we return. I could not help but smile both nights as I watched this piece, and the image the piece left me with was of two hands, brushing up against one another in their sometimes hesitant, sometimes yearning, searching.

I was excited to see two high-energy hip-hop pieces in this year’s performance, the first of which was “Dance and Shout,” choreographed by Emily Oldham and set to the music of Shaggy. This piece was grounded in a kind of explosive expressiveness characteristic of hip-hop dance styles. I was most impressed by this...piece’s pairing of music and movement. As Shaggy’s lyrics and the song’s speedy chorus rolled out of the speakers in Hodson Hall, the dancers were right there with the music, bringing into movement above all the song’s tone. This year’s performance featured a duet by Julia Philpott and Betsy Pinchak, titled “My Weakness,” and set to the poignant sounds of Moby. For me, this piece dramatized some of the same concerns as “In the Wind,” and “Will I?” in a startlingly new fashion. The two dancers began in a moment of embrace, and as the music began its movement outward, they slowly took steps together across the floor before moving apart. I was caught most when Betsy was supported, poised for a moment beyond gravity, on the support of Julia’s back. Dance can be life itself, and this piece, in the moments where the dancers had to support one another’s movements, became not a reflection of the ways in which we as human beings support one another but actual support. Like “Will I?”, this piece returned to where it began, with the two dancers holding and being held, walking their mutual movement across the stage, and showing us, the audience, the blessing that we, with our weaknesses, have in each other.

The second hip-hop piece of the night was “Bugaboo,” set to the Destiny’s Child song of the same name, and choreographed by Reggie McKoy. This piece was McKoy’s first choreography at Davidson, and he and the other dancers made this debut a memorable one. Cohesiveness is centrally important in hip-hop ensemble dancing, and from the first moment that the dancers came down the aisles on stage they were together, even during some of the more technically difficult maneuvers. Hip-hop dancing can be like a duel when between partners, and when the three men and women in this dance partnered up, they expressed just such a tone. This tone fit the Destiny’s Child song as well, and the dance was impressive not only for this matching of song and movement, but for its high-energy polish and for its ability to get the crowd, especially on Saturday night, pumped up and hollering.

After the electric “Bugaboo,” Emily Oldham’s solo piece, “Pretty Good Year,” was a different movement, a celebration of a different kind. Set to the music of Tori Amos, I was most impressed by how Emily was able to capture the stage as her space, as a world for expression, and emotiveness. Or, to put it another way, I was impressed by how she brought the personal world into the public, how her movements seemed to unfold for the outer world, through the dance, the inner world. Perhaps this unfolding is one thing that dance does—it brings the inner reality of the dancer out through the part of the self most connected to the outer world; the body.

It is not surprising, then, that the performance’s final piece was titled “Mind Vision,” choreographed by Julia Philpott and Betsy Pinchak. As is characteristic of Julia’s pieces, “Mind Vision” was able to bring together the efforts of a large number of dancers, to create out of individual movements shapes producing meaning. I was first struck by the sometimes-mechanistic arm movements reminiscent of Julia’s 1999 piece “A Well-Oiled Machine.” But “Mind Vision” explored different worlds than the previous work, splitting up its ensemble cast into two groups on stage that came together and moved apart in a kind of eerie dualism that matched the haunting sounds of Portishead to which the piece was set. On one hand, this piece seemed to continue the exploration of connection and human interaction that earlier pieces in the performance dramatized. On the other hand, however, it seemed as if the split and interaction in “Mind Vision” was within the self itself, such that the dance displayed the sometimes mechanistic, sometimes free, and always beautiful, inner workings that all go on in our inner worlds. All the dancers came together at the end of the piece, picturing, in their alignment on stage, unification in difference.

Perhaps this message is the overriding one of the Spring Performance. Within the different voices sounding out in this year’s concert, we heard one language being used by all. That language, dance, expressed a range of experience and emotion, and suggested that where spoken language may be shot through with difference, the body has its own language, a language understood by all ears and spoken by all tongues.
