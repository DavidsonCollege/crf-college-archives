The Beauty of William Stearns Davis.
“This romance attempts to show forth something of the brilliancy, magnificence and teeming life of Christian Constantinople in an age when London and Paris were little better than squalid villages. It also tries to tell the story of the rise and the mighty deeds of Leo the Isaurian, that peasant youth who saved Constantinople and the Later Roman Empire from the Saracens, and thereby postponed for seven hundred years the extension of Moslem supremacy in the Near East.”—From the Introduction.

Pascal D'Angelo, Son of Italy.
“It is the record of enormous struggles against every disadvantage. Some incalculable chance had put the soul of a poet in the body of an Italian boy whose parents could not read or write and who came into no heritage but the family tradition of hopeless labor. To this was added the further complication that he had to leave his native country for another, there to master an alien tongue and employ it for his utterance. That he gradually overcame his obstacles makes his career one of the most thrilling episodes in American literature.”—From the Introduction.

Davidson Debaters Have Two More Big Contests.
In Shearer Hall, at 8:00 o'clock, next Friday night, Davidson meets Presbyterian College in an intercollegiate debate. One week later another Wildcat team debates the representatives of Wake Forest. This will take place in the auditorium of Queens College, in Charlotte.

The subject of both debates is the same, Resolved, That Congress should be empowered to override by a two-thirds vote the decisions of the Supreme Court declaring the acts of Congress unconstitutional.” In the first debate, Davidson has the affirmative, in the latter the negative. On next Monday night these two Wildcat teams will try their skill against each other. It is expected that this practice contest will prove of much benefit to the debaters in their preparation for refuting the arguments of their opponents.

In the debate with P. C., Davidson will be represented by Martin, Ratchford and Shaw. They will speak in the order named. Three of these men are experienced men in forensic lines. Martin has been an outstanding figure in literary society work. Ratchford and Shaw are both members of Alpha Phi Epsilon.

The Wildcat debaters against Wake Forest will be Parker, Bowie and Wharton. They will take the floor in the order mentioned. These men have had much experience in debating and literary work since they all...

All New Y.M.C.A. Officers and Cabinet Installed at Vesper Meeting
Harry Price, Retiring President, Welcomes New Officers in Inspiring Address
The installation of new officers and the new cabinet was carried out in an impressive service Sunday evening at the Y. M. C. A. vespers. Harry Price, the retiring president, welcomed the new president and his fellow workers. He wished them all of the success possible, and gave a few suggestions as to how work might be furthered in the future. He expressed his sincere appreciation for the co-operation and faithful work of his cabinet, to whom is due thanks for the success of the past year.

Professor Fleagle presented a challenge to the new cabinet. He used the story of Jacob and Esau as an illustration, saying that we have a birthright, a heritage, in the chance to work for the Y. M. C. A. He said that it is an honor to have been chosen to serve on the cabinet, but who among them will sell his birthright? Esau's thought was that he was hungry, and what good was a birthright if he died of hunger? So, how many of the new cabinet will turn their backs on the duties of their offices, and sell their birthright?

J. P. Williams, General Secretary of the Y. M. C. A., gave the charge to the new officers and cabinet. He pledged them to give their honest and highest capable efforts to the service of Christ through the Y. M. C. A. for the following year. Hayden Hollingsworth, the new president, made a splendid address on the indebtedness of Davidson men to the past, present, future, and Christ. “We are all familiar,” he said...

Scholarships to Rhodes Will be Announced Soon
An announcement has recently been made that the 1925 election of Rhodes Scholars will be held on the 12th of December. All applications must be made by the 24th of October since a good deal of investigation must be made before the appointments are announced. The scholars so elected will enter Oxford in October, 1925. Of the states represented at Davidson, the following will hold elections: Florida, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia.

A Rhodes Scholarship is tenable for three years and the stipend is three hundred and fifty pounds a year. Moreover, no restriction is placed on the choice of studies. To be eligible a candidate must be an unmarried male citizen of the United States between the ages of 19 and 25. He must also have completed his Sophomore year at college. A candidate is not chosen simply for the sake of his scholastic ability. His manhood, character, leadership and athletic ability are also considered to a large extent. The appointments are made without examination on the basis of the applicants’ records at college.

Any one who is interested and would like to obtain further information may get it from Dr. T. W.Lingle, or from the secretary of the selection committee of this state, President H. S. Hilley, Wilson, N.C. This is the premier college scholarship in the United States, so that any student who has a desire for higher learning should investigate the matter more closely. One of Davidson's alumni holds one of the scholarships at the present time. 

Force of record information to attend both debates. Neither of the debates will be easily won and the Wildcat representatives will need much support from the audience. “Mutt” is also a member of Beta Pi. He is a hard worker and will make a useful and capable right-hand man for “Bob.”

“Rod” MacRae hails from Laurinburg, N.C., where he, too, was a leader in all school activities. He is very popular here at Davidson, where he is recognized as an excellent speaker and as a leader, in general, among his classmates. He is a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon Fraternity. Without a doubt, “Rod” will very capably fill the office of Secretary and Treasurer.

SANITY RARE SCORES
(Continued from page 1)

The magazine is “The Pipes of Pan,” a poem by Fred Smith, illustrated by Kenneth Harris. Both poem and full-page illustration are very good, and have received much favorable comment from the students and visitors. The other good contributions are too numerous to mention in detail, and all who had a hand in its publication are to be congratulated on the good work.

The rising Junior class would do well to fashion their magazine after the efforts of the present Junior class. Additional copies of “Sanity Rare” may be obtained from the business manager for a small sum.

JUNIOR SPEAKING
(Continued from page 6)

In charge of the refreshment booth, K. K. Regen in charge of the ball throwing booth, A. B. Williford in charge of the fish pond, Lawson Appleby in charge of and acted as Voodoo the Hoodoo.

Talking to His disciples and asked, “Will ye also go away?” Peter asked, “To whom shall we go? Thou hast the eternal life. We know and are sure that thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.” I think it was such a knowledge of Christ that Paul had in mind when he said, “I am debtor.” He felt he should give his life to pay the debt.

“My message tonight concerns our debt and how we are going to pay it. First of all, we are debtors to those who have gone before. Tonight throughout the world there are sons of Davidson who have left to us a priceless heritage. They have given their all to make Davidson a place where the name of Christ is above every name. Among those who have gone before we are debtors to the retiring cabinet for the work they have done and the splendid example they have set.

“We are also debtors to those who are here now. We have a debt to pay to our fellow-students in making ourselves count for the best possible influence for them. It is not what we are going to do ten years from now in business, the ministry, or on a mission field—it is what we are going to do here in the marketplace that will count.

“We are debtors to those who are to come. I am thinking tonight of more than two hundred and fifty young men throughout the Southland who are dreaming dreams of Davidson. I am thinking of the Freshmen who are to come and of the ideals they have. They are dreaming of athletic teams sweeping down the field to victory. May their dreams come true, but we are debtors to them to let them know of that victory which overcomes the world, even our faith in Jesus Christ.

“Above all else we are debtors to Jesus Christ. God gave all He had when He sent Christ into a sin-cursed world. It was the knowledge of God's gift that spurred Paul on to give his life to pay the debt. On this Easter Sunday may we hear the echo from the tomb, ‘Lo! He is not here—He is risen.’ Easter stands for a fact. The fact that faith is more vital than doubt; that hope is more lasting than fear; that love is stronger than death. In the twilight of this Easter day may we stand beneath the shadow of the cross and say, ‘Lord, thy will be done, take my life and use me to pay the debt.’”

“Piggy” Martin was the leader. Prayer was offered by E. B. Gibbs. Special music was rendered by Martin’s quartet, with J. R. McCravey, J. R. Tally, J. S. Grey, and W. W. Purdy accompanying the songs of the evening.

They have been at Davidson and are expected to present winning arguments when they journey to the Queen City. All three are members of Alpha Phi Epsilon. After the debate on next Friday, there will be a reception for the debaters, given by the forensic council and Alpha Phi Epsilon forensic fraternity. A large number of students are expected for the work they have done and the splendid example they have set.
