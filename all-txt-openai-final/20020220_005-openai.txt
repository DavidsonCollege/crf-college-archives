Vancouver’s New Pornographers exceed expectations

By Curtis SCHMADER

On Friday night, the New Pornographers played a fantastic show to a full house at the club Room 4 in
Carrboro, North Carolina. For those readers who don’t know, and I’m sure there are many of you, the New Pornographers
are a Canadian rock group, and not very concerned with smut, at that. Instead, they play euphoric pop songs with
bludgeoning force, never letting the listener off the hook for an instant. Their exceptionally tuneful music is a guiltless pleasure,
like pornography without the sleaze, and on Friday they were in top form as they galloped their way through their
only album to date, Mass Romantic.

The Pornographers consist of members of several other obscure Canadian bands: singers/guitarists/songwriters Carl Newman (of the band Zumpano) and Dan
Bejar (Destroyer), alt-country siren Neko Case, bassist John Collins, drummer Kurt Dahle, and keyboardist Blaine Thurier. The band began as
a side project between friends, and the band members’ camaraderie was evident in their easygoing manner between songs, when they
casually poked fun at each other and the audience, at one point having to endure the question, “So what happened
to the old pornographers?” Thankfully, they kept the repartee to a minimum, which couldn’t be said of openers the Frames,
an Irish band with an annoyingly talkative frontman. The Frames’ songs dealt mainly with hypnotic vocals crooned and wailed over
a textured backdrop of guitar, bass, violin, and drum parts that veered back and forth between extremely soft and extremely
loud. Think of a less inventive and less interesting version of Mogwai and you have the Frames. The New Pornographers’
hyperactive power pop ended up providing a welcome change of pace from the unimpressive drone of the opening act.

Unfortunately, the headliners lacked one half of their songwriting team, with Mr. Bejar being replaced on guitar by Todd Fancey
and on vocals by Mr. Dahle, but the rest of the band more than made up for his absence by
performing with impressive passion and precision. Both Mr. Newman’s and Mr. Bejar’s songwriting styles do not lend themselves to easy
live performance. Mr. Newman writes loud, quick-tempo pop hooks and highly arranged harmonies, while Mr. Bejar opts for less obvious
tunes and more shifts in dynamics and speed. To complicate matters, both songwriters fill their material with emphatic stops-on-a-dime after
which every instrument in the band hits with full force. Their songs sound wonderful on Mass Romantic, but I had
doubts going into the show as to whether they would be able to replicate the intricate melodic rush they captured
so well in the studio. I only needed one song to have these doubts completely obliterated.

The band opened superbly with “The Slow Descent Into Alcoholism,” a song with a tricky march-like beat and typically challenging
vocal parts. In concert, the Pornographers actually sounded better than they do on Mass Romantic, which suffers slightly from a
sterile atmosphere created by its ultra-slick production. While the band executed its material tightly live, the guitars and vocals sounded
just rough enough around the edges to heighten the intensity and emotion of captivating songs like “The Body Says No”
and “Mass Romantic.” Mr. Newman, Ms. Case, and Mr. Dahle did an excellent job singing difficult harmonies, and the performance
hit a high note with Ms. Case’s unhinged vocals on “Letter From an Occupant,” a song that has camped out
in my head for the past three days and shows no signs of leaving. Other highlights included Mr. Bejar’s bouncy
“Breakin’ the Law,” as well as the seamless three-count transition from the soaring, heavily distorted “Mystery Hours” to the brilliant
“Execution Day,” which ended with each instrument dropping out of the mix one by one before surging back to full
volume for the final refrain. The band finished by playing what could be called a three-song encore, closing with “Centre
for Holy Wars,” although they didn’t leave the stage after the main set because of the club’s tight confines. By
the end of their hour and fifteen-minute show, the Pornographers had completely mesmerized the audience with their relentlessly joyful power
pop. Should they decide to stick around—remember, this is a side project—they would be a welcome addition to the pantheon
of brilliant, commercially unsuccessful indie bands scattered throughout rock history.
