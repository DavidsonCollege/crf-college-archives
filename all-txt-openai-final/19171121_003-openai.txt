MANY VISITORS PRESENT AT MARRIAGE CEREMONY

A wedding of much interest took place Wednesday evening at the home of Mrs. W. F. Wooten, when her daughter,
Miss Sarah Alice, was given in marriage to Mr. Willis Neal Johnston, of Mooresville, N. C.

The interior of the home was beautifully decorated in green and white.

The bridal party entered at 6:30 from the hall to the strains of Mendelssohn's wedding march, in the following order:
The flower girls, little Misses Sarah and Helen Johnston, sisters of the groom, dressed in white organdie with Argyle green
ribbons, followed by Master James Rutledge Withers, dressed in white velvet, carrying the ring in a lily; the groom, with
his brother, Mr. Conrad Johnston, as best man; the maid of honor, Miss Marjorie Dance. Then, the bride, attired in
pure white charmeuse, trimmed in lace, court train, with veil of white caught with pearls and lilies of the valley,
entered with her mother. At 6:45 the ceremony was performed, Drs. R. M. Richards and M. E. Sentelle officiating.

Preceding the entrance of the bridal party, J. L. Fowle sang “Entreat Me Not to Leave Thee,” and “Thou Art
Like a Lovely Flower,” Professor Ariail accompanying him at the piano.
