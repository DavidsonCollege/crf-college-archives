Berner at the Paralympic Games this past September in Sydney, Australia, where she won four silver medals. “I was so amazed not only by the athletes, but also the people,” said Berner following her return from Down Under. “After winning one of my silver medals, I rode the bus back to the hotel with the coach and only a couple other people. When I got off, there were people there with sparklers and taking pictures of me. The people truly made the event a memorable experience."

Every year for the past 24 years, the Honda Awards Program has been honoring top female collegiate athletes. This year, Davidson junior swimmer Kendra Berner has been named the Honda Inspiration Award winner. American Honda Motor Co., Inc., sponsor of the Honda Awards Program, annually recognizes the top Division I woman collegiate athlete in each of 12 sports, as well as acknowledging the top women collegiate athletes representing Division II and Division III.

Over the last 12 years, the Honda Awards Program has also recognized several individuals who have been an inspiration to those around them with the Honda Inspiration Award. The Inspiration Award is intended to honor a woman student-athlete who, by her perseverance, commitment, and dedication, has overcome personal adversity or disability, or has undergone extraordinary personal sacrifice while achieving recognizable success in women’s collegiate athletics.

Berner, a native of Lake Bluff, Ill., was born with a congenital deformation of her right hand. She utilizes a training paddle, cut to the size and shape of her left hand when competing in the pool.

The 2000-01 season had been an exciting one for Berner. Back at Davidson, Berner swam the fastest time for the 50 freestyle this season by a Wildcat at the Colonial Athletic Association Championships. Her time of 24.86 seconds stands as the second fastest in school history. Also at the CAAs, she recorded the best time this year by a Davidson swimmer, and the third fastest in school history, in the 200 freestyle. Over her three-year career, Berner has been a member of three Wildcat record-setting relay teams.

“Kendra’s achievements are shining examples of personal commitment and dedication,” said Davidson Director of Athletics Jim Murphy. “We are extremely proud of Kendra. The Honda Inspiration Award is a fitting tribute to her efforts on behalf of Davidson College through our swimming program and the United States through the Paralympics.

“More importantly, this award highlights Kendra’s character, strength, charisma, and leadership as she sweeps us all forward with her intense focus on reaching her goals.”

Berner, along with the 14 other recipients of the program, will be honored at the Collegiate Woman Athlete of the Year Banquet held at the Grand America Hotel in June in Salt Lake City, Utah.Categories from S1 to S10 with S1 considered the most disabled. Berner was placed in the S10 category. At the Paralympics in Australia in October, Berner accumulated four silver medals: 400 freestyle, 100 freestyle, 50 freestyle, and 400 freestyle relay. In the 50 freestyle, she finished 0.39 seconds behind the winner who set a new world record.

By Derek Smith, Davidson S.I.D.

The Davidson lacrosse team’s season came to an end Saturday afternoon with a 17-7 loss to the ninth-ranked College of William & Mary at Busch Field. For the second straight game, Davidson (7-10) jumped out to a 1-0 lead. Senior Lauren Kenchington (Annapolis, Md.) scored at the 26:24 mark. Sophomore Loren Seaton (Moorestown, N.J.) scored two first-half goals to give Davidson a 3-2 edge with 16:01 to play. But William & Mary was quick to respond, as Lindsay Lowman was credited for one of her school-record eight assists on a goal by Tara Hannaford. Lowman put the Tribe ahead for good at 9:01 when she took a feed and found the back of the net for a 4-3 lead. William & Mary scored three more goals to end the half on a 4-0 run and took a 7-3 lead into intermission. The Tribe continued their scoring run as they opened the half with two more goals. Seaton scored her third goal of the afternoon with 19:30 to play in the game. Senior Stephanie Hunter (Melvin Village, N.H.) scored her final goal of her Davidson career with 14:12 to play and Seaton followed that with her fourth goal to cut the deficit to just three goals, 9-6. The Tribe answered with a 7-1 run to close the game. The final Wildcat goal of the season came at the 5:07 mark as junior Christin Raimondo (Latrobe, Pa.) scored an unassisted goal.
