Jugglers prepare for Hurricane Hugo Fest

Press RELEASE
College Relations

Davidson College will host some of the most talented object manipulators in the nation Sept. 25-27, when the College Union hosts the Hurricane Hugo Juggling Festival. Those interested in juggling, or in learning to juggle, are invited to participate in the weekend’s shows, workshops, and juggling games. Special guest at the festival will be Laura Green, “The Juggling Queen,” a widely heralded performer of juggling and other New Vaudeville skills.

This will be the ninth annual Hurricane Hugo Festival. The Charlotte Jugglers Association held the first in 1990 “in recollection of that frightful night in 1989 when Hurricane Hugo blew through, sending objects flying through the sky in an uncontrolled cascade of fury!” It is one of about 50 annual weekend festivals hosted by juggling clubs around the nation and should attract participants from as far away as Florida and New York. Some are professional performers, and others are dedicated amateurs. The most skilled among them will be close to world record levels, which are cascading (briefly) 10 balls, seven clubs, and 11 rings.

The major Hugo Festival activities include a midnight fire juggling display to conclude the College Union's campus-wide “Lunar Luau” party on Friday night, a Saturday morning “learn to juggle” session for the general public on the Davidson Village Green, a half-time juggling show for Davidson's varsity football game on Saturday afternoon, and a Saturday night “Gutz Juggling Show” featuring Laura Green. The festival will conclude Sunday afternoon with juggling games.

Davidson students will take an active role in staffing the festival. Many Davidson students are already avid jugglers. About 50 per year take a juggling course to help fulfill their physical education requirement. In addition, an annual “freshman juggling survey” conducted over the past seven years by festival coordinator and Davidson staffer Bill Giduz shows that at least one-third of entering freshmen can juggle three balls.

Headquarters for the event will be Johnston Gym, with registration beginning at 3 p.m. on Friday, Sept. 25. Those who pay a $10 registration fee will receive tickets to a Saturday night pizza party, the Saturday night “Juggling Queen” show, and the football game. However, unregistered visitors are welcome at any time to visit the gym to view activities and participate in workshops.

Saturday’s public juggling lessons on the Village Green in downtown Davidson run from 9 a.m. to noon. Visitors will receive free water-injected tennis balls for practice and as take-home souvenirs, and will be treated to juggling performances throughout the morning. Jugglers will present the halftime show at the football game vs. Emory & Henry College. The game begins at 1:30 p.m., and the halftime show should begin around 2:30 p.m. Football fans will enjoy watching a 100-yard juggling race on the gridiron and a round or two of juggling Combat, in which club jugglers attempt to make each other drop (last one juggling wins). The show will conclude with an ultimate photo opportunity — The Big Toss-Up. Jugglers will gather in front of the grandstands and, on the count of three, toss their props in the air as high as possible — then duck!

Saturday night’s Hurricane Hugo All-Star Revue will feature Laura Green in Johnston Gym, beginning at 8 p.m.Green has performed her unique blend of object manipulation, character sketches, music, and comedy at all of North America’s major street performing festivals, schools, and even the Smithsonian Institution for the past two decades. The gym will be open Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. At 1 p.m., jugglers will participate in a series of juggling games, including endurance contests in juggling five balls and five clubs, a blindfold three-juggle, juggling races, distance club passing contests, and an obstacle course juggling race. For more information on the festival, contact Bill Giduz.
