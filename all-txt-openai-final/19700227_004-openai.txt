More applications for admission have been received than for any year since 1967, according to Mr. Regen, Director of Admissions. He added that the admissions office is in a good position to enroll more qualified black students than it has in the past years. Allen has already received 17 applications to date and does not expect the number to exceed 20. Here is how the applications of the coming year compare with those of previous years. As of February 26, 1970, the Admissions Office received approximately 1078 applications from prospective students; as of February 26, 1969, 1023 applications were received; as of February 26, 1968, 975 applications were received; as of February 26, 1967, 1130 applications were received. The drop in 1968 was due to an especially large high school senior population in 1967.

Mr. Regen attributed the rise in the number of applications to the interest stimulated nationally by the undefeated College Bowl team and the nationally ranked basketball team of Davidson. He also pointed out as a factor the increase in the number of high school seniors. According to Bobby Allen, the Admissions Office is taking an encouraging attitude toward enrolling black students. Allen is on the admissions office staff working in the recruitment of black students for Davidson. He reported that there was only a moderate increase in the number of black applicants and added that the admissions office is in a good position to enroll more qualified students than it has in the past years. Allen has already received 17 applications to date and does not expect the number to exceed 20.

Allen said the increased efforts have not produced comparable results because of disadvantages that the Admissions Office is attempting to overcome. Davidson has no black admissions officer, but is trying to get one. This is the main obstacle to a rise in black enrollment at the moment. Another factor is the lack of adequate manpower in the Admissions Office. A final factor is the identity problem that black students have here. Finally, the College is faced with stiff competition from professional recruiters representing Ivy League schools.

FABULOUS DINING

With the announced intent of making the Selective Service more responsive to the needs of the public, the North Carolina Director of the Selective Service System has set up a Youth Advisory Committee. The western region has already held two local meetings in Charlotte, mainly for organizational purposes, and the state committee as a whole is still just in the formative stages.Reading the student would be required to write a research or reaction paper having some relation to the area.

For the first time, Frierson stressed, as ad- 1318 W. Morehead tem has set up a Youth Advisory Committee on the draft, with junior Bob Hag- gard as one of the leaders. This Youth Advisory Com- mittee is part of a plan in all states by the national Selective Service headquarters at Raleigh. 

“I doubt if we'll get very far,” said Frierson. “We should follow up on it to get the maximum benefit from the symposium. In a related area, the Educational Policy Committee is working on a reform of the exam system, so that we may have self-scheduled exams, eventually. We need to make the committee structure more effective,” said Miss Breazeal. “With sixteen committees, it is hard to keep things running as smoothly as we would like to, although committee activity has not been totally ineffective by any stretch of the imagination. The coordinate committees of students and faculty would be more effective, for example, if they were united, rather than separate.”

Miss Breazeal concurred. “In my three years at Queens, the student body has, as a whole, become more aware,” she said. “More and more, we realize that our interests should stretch further than the confines of 1900 Selwyn Avenue. Our students are much more concerned with occurrences in the outside world than the average Davidson gentleman might suspect.”

The Senate voted to withdraw an earlier proposal allowing the students full privileges. The proposal will now be returned to the SGA Educational Affairs Committee where it will be reformulated. 

The major business before the Senate Wednesday night involved student membership on the Admissions Committee. SGA President Ran Coble suggested that the proposal be withdrawn in favor of one allowing the Senate Educational Policy Committee to appoint two non-voting senators to the committee. 

Dean Gebhardt singled out the decision of the Residence Student Council to allow qualifying students (1 point average) discretion in the number of weekends which each can take as a change of responsibility in college life. 

“Queens students are more career conscious now,” she said. “But the present placement system does not come near to meeting this new demand. Students are much more concerned with occurrences in the outside world than the average Davidson gentleman might suspect.”

The last year has seen a number of changes which widened the area of student responsibility in college life. Dean Gebhardt singled out the decision of the Residence Student Council to allow qualifying students (1 point average) discretion in the number of weekends which each can take as a change of responsibility in college life. 

Miss Breazeal also singled out a strengthened placement program as another goal of student activity in the future. 

The question of changes in the nature of the Queens student brought a close consensus of opinion among those in positions of responsibility: The Queens girl is not what she used to be. 

“The girls here now are more forceful,” said Miss Carlock. “They are more willing to put their ideas across. They are not so affected by traditional rules and are constantly questioning their value. In sum, there is a new type of activism here.”
