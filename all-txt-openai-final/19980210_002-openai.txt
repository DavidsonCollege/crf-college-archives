Some students are choosing to spend their spring breaks doing something quite different this year. Members of Alternative Breaks have planned three trips that are unlike any “vacation” students have ever experienced. Sophomores Liz Clasen and Anna Judy are leading a trip to Washington D.C. to work with AIDS patients. Doug Penhallegon, a junior, is leading a trip to the Emmaus House in Harlem. Jesse Montgomery, a freshman, is leading a trip to Washington D.C. to participate in the Urban Plunge and work with issues of homelessness. These three trips are ones of service that are bound to make an incredible impact on the participants.

The group, led by Clasen and Judy, will work with HIV-positive and AIDS patients. This work will consist of delivering meals to patients and helping social workers care for the patients. Many Davidson students know very little about the AIDS virus. The goals of this program are to learn about how this virus affects people spiritually and socially and to share the information with other students who did not participate. The group will work with AIDS patients for four to five hours a day. The rest of the day will hopefully be used to help build a habitat house. The group will stay at the Center for Creative Non-violence, one of the largest homeless shelters in Washington D.C. There they will spend time doing activities with people who live on the disabled hall. The group will attend AA meetings where they will learn about the situations that afflict Washington’s homeless. The group will leave Sunday, March 1st and return Saturday, March 7th. The maximum number of participants for this trip is ten, and the maximum cost is around thirty dollars. The group will be doing some fundraising to help with costs.

Montgomery’s group will take part in the Urban Plunge for the first 48 hours of the trip. The Urban Plunge program is designed to allow “economically-privileged people to dress down, empty their wallets, and spend time on the streets as ‘poor’ people.” This program is sponsored by the National Coalition for the Homeless who define its goals as the following: “To familiarize and sensitize middle-class people with the realities and hardships of inner-city life; to gain first-hand knowledge of the growing crisis of homelessness; to bring homelessness to a very personal level; and to see the world through the eyes of a...homeless person.” The group will receive guidance from Michael Stoops, who is in charge of this program. Then the group will split up and get a taste of what it is like to be homeless. Members of this program are encouraged to dress down, beg, look through trash cans, talk to homeless people, make signs, sleep on park benches, eat cereal out of dog or cat food containers, donate plasma for money, and many other activities that make up real homeless peoples’ days. There are many questions of safety surrounding this program. Penhallegon, who participated in the program, said, “The most dangerous thing I encountered last year was a hooker, so I turned around and left.” Participants have to use their best judgment and avoid getting into dangerous situations. The plunge is open to an unlimited number of students who want to participate, but the second part of the program is limited to five students. For the remainder of the week, the group will stay at the Calvary women’s shelter in the section designated for volunteers. Here they will help with the shelter and work at some of the nearby soup kitchens. Penhallegon’s group will be spending the week at the Emmaus House in Harlem. This house is for former drug addicts who receive three meals a day and a stipend of 25 dollars a week. Here the residents gain self-esteem and the skills to live independently. Some of the duties of the volunteers include painting, hauling trash, working in the soup kitchen, and even working with emergency meals on wheels. Within the house, the group will have a great opportunity to interact with the residents. Penhallegon said, “I want people in my group to come away with a real sense of the gravity of poverty.” The group is donating $600 to the Emmaus House for the cost of their stay. Ann Nickel stayed at the house last year and describes it as an “incredible emotional experience.” She went back to the house in the summer and found that the residents she met in the spring were no longer there because they found jobs and are living on their own. The group will also have time to see New York. Last year they visited Greenwich Village and Manhattan. Alternative Breaks is growing and hopes to offer additional programs for the summer. These three trips offer students a way to provide services for others during their spring breaks.
