yet another

Baby Ben timepiece clicks endlessly;
unwound it deserts me

Fluorescent tube numbs out light, brightly;
enervated it spurns me

Refrigerator burps its coldness, frigidity;
opened to reveal porcelain plastic, empty.

I sit
and don’t eat
and don’t suffocate
and wither

Irv Wilson

Window shade of institutional brown hides what;
released it uncovers only institutional bareness

Radiator clanks and clangs mightily;
futilely for its tubes are spaghetti nothings

Dreams are day-born and chromatic vivid;
but the books are gone and Freud’s dead

I sit
and don’t eat
and don’t suffocate
and wither

Macfarlane
