The Athens, Ga.-based group appeared last February in the 900 Room to a sold-out crowd. “We had to turn students
away. I didn’t talk to anyone who didn’t like it,” said Concert Committee Chairman Jim Hoskins.

Oh-OK will open for R.E.M. The performance will be open to the public, and 1,200 seats will be sold.
