Davidson’s Track Team Victorious Over S. C. Murray Breaks College Record for 220-Yard Dash. Captain McTuller’s squad easily took the
measure of the South Carolina track team in the meet held here Saturday afternoon. The main feature of the contest
was the 220-yard dash which was won by Murray in the record time of 22 2-5 seconds. The record was
previously held by J. W. S. Gilchrist, ’15, who made the distance in 23 flat. The half mile which was
won by Finley also proved sensational. The final score was fifty-six to thirty-four. Those men winning their letter for the
first time are Finley, McLeod, Brice, Sprunt, and A. R. Craig. The last named is to be especially commended on
the sportsmanlike spirit shown in the mile run. Murray won his first star, and McQueen his second. The summary of

CLARK AND CASSELL LEAD IN BATTING AVERAGES
The batting average for the team through the game with Trinity Friday shows Clark and Cassell leading, followed closely by
Cop Johnson. The lack of hitting in the first two games causes the general average to be somewhat low, however.
In the last three games it showed quite an improvement and by next week, we expect a much higher average.
