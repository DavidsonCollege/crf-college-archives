single-sex houses.

I’m not trying to condemn this change. The Court offers many opportunities for personal growth and friendships. But I do
feel that the emphasis on the houses isolates individuals, the sexes, students’ energies, and generally de-emphasizes the college community as
a whole. But the Court is the most vibrant place on campus. Most student organizations are hardly lively; indeed they
must struggle to exist. I do not welcome or condemn the change; I accept it as the will of the
student body. I do feel that Davidson is much more boring than it was ten years ago. Think of your
own situation. Unless you are a heroic part of some student organization, what can you specifically tell others about you
and Davidson? Other than our course work, most of our thoughts regard specific social situations, not participation in an organization.

The death of “Flipsides” points to the void in student culture at Davidson. I ask you to pick up an
annual or newspaper of eight or ten years ago and try to imagine what the school was like. Compare it
with the current newspaper or annual. The difference is dramatic. I wonder what students who look at us in ten
years will think about us after seeing these publications. Finally, ask yourself what have you done at Davidson (other than
course work) that you can really be proud of ten years from now. Unless we make an effort to improve
the quality of our college community and to enrich our lives, we can expect our memories of Davidson to be
a bland collage of half-read books and unconnected social incidents involving people we might have known.
