Andy Owen's "In Random Order" Showing in Chambers

By Will Montgomery

A provocative series of works by visiting Assistant Art Professor Andy Owen is currently displayed in the Chambers Gallery. Owen's
professional forte is printmaking, and he instructs both Design and Printmaking this semester. His show, entitled “In Random Order,” presents
a combination of pieces done through variations of the printmaking process. Much of the success of his show stems from
the interplay between traditional techniques and innovation.

Owen explains that lithography has been done for centuries. It involves drawing onto a stone and using the repellent properties
of oil and water to create an image. The process is methodical and time-consuming, and involves many steps. Creating vitreographs
is an equally painstaking process, but the technique of sandblasting glass sheets is relatively new and technologically advanced. Recent pieces
done this fall with a steamroller in the parking lot behind the computer services center emphasize a developed process as
well. Yet the result is far more liberated and spontaneous, approaching performance art. Owen flattens objects, which smear paint onto
paper as they are crushed. The images are random, yet often maintain some semblance of the geometry and structure of
the original object. His crushed sunglasses piece incorporates the boards used to print the image with the paper printed product
to form a triptych. Owen chooses to include the “press” in order to reiterate the sense of process and provide
a glimpse at where the print came from.

Owen usually finds the objects in trash dumps, and relates that much of the fun in his work comes from
meeting the people who supply him with trash or lend him steamrollers. He tells of the worker at a plastic
supply house who could identify the chemical makeup of any piece of plastic trash simply by lighting a corner of
the plastic and sniffing the black glob of toxic smoke. Besides the eclectic characters he encounters while searching for material,
the actual printing process behind the computer center provided social interaction as well, involving students and curious bystanders. Owen’s images
themselves express this context of many parts contributing to a single moment. They contain rich explosions of color and hyperactive
texture, but are subtly restrained by the hard edges of gears, computer disks, wires, and car parts.

The exhibit runs through February 13 and is open during regular Chambers Gallery hours. Due to the range and variety
of the show, the exhibit is well worth visiting several times. A reception for the artist will be held on
Friday, January 24 at 7:30 p.m.

The first words to escape the mouth of Bono, that eternally troubled and usually quite pushy Irishman, on U2’s new
album Achtung Baby are “I’m ready, I’m ready for the laughing gas.” This line proves prophetic as the sickeningly socially
conscious band throws pretense and any message out the window on their new effort. While Bono used to tell us
he had only “a red guitar, three chords, and the truth” (from Rattle and Hum), he seems somehow to have
acquired some dance moves and a sense of humor in the last three years. And it is a relief.

When U2 started producing music in the early 80s, their vision was clouded by the conflict and violence they had
experienced growing up in Northern Ireland.

Throughout the three hours of J.F.K., director Oliver Stone bombards the audience with a seemingly endless barrage of visual, aural,
and moral assaults. Stone has picked the most salient fragments of several contradicting theories regarding the assassination of John F.
Kennedy, and he has strewn them together to create a brilliant thriller. Momentarily avoiding the debate which has preoccupied the
pundits, J.F.K. is excellent entertainment. Kevin Costner stars as Jim Garrison, the New Orleans District Attorney who brought charges against
businessman Clay Shaw in

The world is nuts, folks, completely and utterly whacked beyond what any of us can hope to control. And this
same wonderful Earth that brings us televised professional bowling and drive-by random shootings continues staring us right in the face
and refuses to blink. This is the intermittently depressingMessage that Lawrence Kasdan’s *Grand Canyon* delivers us from the get-go. But
it also implies hope, that perhaps a time might come when it doesn’t seem like all that fine an idea
to shoot each other up in a wild masochistic frenzy. Just maybe. I guess I can begin by saying that
this is an altogether worthwhile film, even though seeing it requires a now-inconvenient trip to Charlotte.

First of all, the screenplay is one of the most original I’ve ever seen. Writers Lawrence and Meg Kasdan provide
slight glimpses of characters for most of the film and thus allow the audience to construct links for themselves and
pronounce its own judgments on what one means to another. The Kasdans’ end product presents six Los Angeles residents on
opposite sides of the socio-economic fence and each person’s realizations that none can escape the problems of the others. The
viewer sees characters with widely varying financial resources (the metaphorical canyon) and strikingly similar inabilities to deny suffering in the
world. Those that could seemingly forget about it the easiest sometimes get smacked hardest by others’ misfortune.

In *Grand Canyon*, Kevin Kline plays an upper-middle-class Los Angelean who is saved from thugs by Danny Glover when his
car breaks down in a less than savory neighborhood after a late Lakers game. Kline befriends the somewhat confused Glover
because of a similar life-saving incident years earlier when he never got to thank his benefactor. The following incidents relate
Kline’s disturbed marriage and the remnants of a short-lived affair.

**Achtung Baby: U2's New Attitude Succeeds**

Ireland. The whole situation resulted in compelling music with strong messages for the people involved in the carnage. And it
caught the ear of the younger record-buying public, as they were intrigued by the urgency of the music. By the
release of their second album *Boy*, U2 had taken a position of great influence on the young people of Europe
as well as America. Refusing to ignore the responsibility of that position, they continued to promote attitudes of tolerance and
social responsibility, notably with their albums *The Unforgettable Fire*, a tribute to Martin Luther King Jr., and *The Joshua Tree*,
whose songs comment on the social problems of this country. The switch from an exasperation with Ireland’s problems to a
preoccupation with America’s, though, was a turning point for the band.

While their outrage at society’s injustice remains legitimate, the crossing to this continent may have blunted U2’s wit. By the
time *Rattle and Hum* came out in 1988, Bono was taking back songs that “Charles Manson stole from the Beatles”
(“Helter Skelter”) and telling us about the color of his guitar and the truth he had. It was all just
annoying, really. The pretension, the admonitions, the preaching—it had lost its “importance.” And, thankfully, the band took a long break,
on which they seem to have acquired a new attitude toward their music. It doesn’t have to push people toward
progress, but it can, from time to time.

**Oliver Stone's Moralizing Doesn't Mar The Suspenseful and Exciting *J.F.K.***

1968 for conspiring to kill John Kennedy. As expected, Costner’s rendering of Garrison is in the same heroic vein as
his portrayals of Eliot Ness in *The Untouchables*, Lt. Dunbar in *Dances With Wolves*, and Robin Hood in *Robin Hood:
Prince of Thieves*. Costner’s performance in *J.F.K.* is just as tedious as in the aforementioned showcases for the star.

The characters and actors surrounding Costner are far more interesting. Joe Pesci is jarring as alleged conspirator David Ferrie. The
hysterical articulation which Pesci brings to the psychotic Ferrie will possibly garner him a second Academy Award. Tommy Lee Jones
luxuriates in his portrayal of the menacing Shaw. Jones relishes this opportunity to ham it up, and he does so
wonderfully. Jack Lemmon, Ed Asner, John Candy, and Donald Sutherland also contribute brief but fine performances.

Stone’s meticulous craftsmanship is ever-present in *J.F.K.*. The film moves at an exhilarating pace from mid-sixties New Orleans to fantastic
dramatizations of hypothetical situations. While often sudden, these changes in time and place are so well structured and visually distinct.
