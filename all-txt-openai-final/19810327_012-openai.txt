**Prospectives descend on DC**

No, we’re not being invaded by UNCC or Charlotte Latin High School; it’s the SGA’s third Annual Admissions weekend! About one hundred highly qualified prospective students selected by Davidson’s new "early assessment" program will be attending classes and meeting the campus community this weekend. Everyone is heartily invited to come meet some of next year’s friends for coffee and cokes on Friday at 10 a.m. in Chambers Gallery. A campus-wide Field Day with food and fun for all will be held on Chambers lawn at 2 p.m. Friday. In case of rain, meet in the gym. The weekend is sponsored by the SGA and was planned by members of the Student Admissions Team. Chairman Diana Pierce said team members wrote to all applicants this year to give prospective freshmen the students’ point of view.

Former prof’s son returns for concert

Cellist Lee Richey will be giving a recital Wednesday, April 1 at 8 p.m. in the 900 Room. His program includes works of J.S. Bach, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Dmitrii Shostakovich.

Richey attended Aspen Music Festival last summer and has played chamber music throughout North Carolina. This talented young performer comes to Davidson as a friend. He grew up here, and his father, the late David Richey, was a composer and Professor of Music at Davidson. Richey’s recital is free.
