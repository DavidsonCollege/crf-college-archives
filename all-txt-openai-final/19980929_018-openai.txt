Golf opens season with strong performance at College of Charleston

By BRIAN MAYERHOFER
Sports Editor

Last season, the men’s golf team had their strongest finish in years as they finished fourth in the Southern Conference.
This year, the Cats looked to build on that finish as they faced tough competition at the Charleston Southern Falls
Invitational. At the Coosaw Creek Country Club (6593 yds, Par 71), Davidson finished in 6th place in a field of
12 with a team score of 588.

With last year’s MVP, Jason Lina, gone to graduation, senior captain Dave Alexander led the Cats by tying for 12th
place in a field of sixty. Alexander shot 73-71-144. Alexander’s 144 was five shots behind the tournament’s champion, Elon’s Terry
Slater (69-70-139). Elon also took home the team title, beating second place teams Coastal Carolina and Charleston Southern by an
astounding fourteen shots. Elon played the course in an amazing six shots under par.

Still, Alexander did not carry the team as several other Davidson players played well. Senior David Deschler had a very
strong performance as he finished in the top twenty. He shot rounds of 74 and 72. After a shaky opening
round of 77, sophomore Sean Davidson shot a one over par 72 to finish in a tie for 28th. Sophomore
Austin Ziegler and freshman Oliver Cross also made their season debuts.

For its first tournament of the year, the Cats played very well against tough competition. They faced two Southern Conference
foes, Citadel and Western Carolina. While Citadel managed to edge Davidson by two strokes, the Cats finished fourteen shots ahead
of the Catamounts. It’s encouraging that the Cats played well with a relatively inexperienced lineup. While the Cats were led
by strong performances from two seniors, the key for the year will be how much progress the underclassmen make. If
they keep improving, expect Davidson to improve on last year’s fourth place performance. The Wildcats' next tournament will be at
the Belvedere Intercollegiate Classic at UNC-W this coming weekend.

Women’s fall tennis preview

While the official women’s tennis season doesn’t begin for months, the team has spent the last few weekends traveling to
places as diverse as Cornell, Virginia Tech, and N.C. State to get ready for the spring.

This past weekend the Cats were in Blacksburg, Virginia at the Virginia Tech Fall Invitational. While Davidson faced some very
tough competition, there were many fine individual performances. Freshmen Kelly Cantrell and Whitney Boykin were especially impressive. Boykin blew through
the competition at the #8 singles spot. In the final, she trounced Virginia Tech’s Monica Archondo 6-2, 6-2. In the
#5 singles final, Cantrell faced conference rival Cara Prupas of ETSU. In a heartbreaker, Cantrell lost in a third set
tiebreaker. Another highlight for Davidson was the performance of the #4 doubles team, Caitlin Haskell and Elizabeth Moreno, as they
won their flight. While Davidson played well over the weekend, they were hurt by the absence of their regular #1
and #2 singles players, Dana Casner and Amber Bradford. They were replaced by Claire Cheatwood and Brenna Tindall. After winning
her opening match, Tindall finished in a tie for third. Still, the Cats should take heart that when Casner and
Bradford are available, they will be even stronger.

Casner’s and Bradford’s strength was evident in the first tournament of the year (September 12-13) at Cornell University. Both players
went 3-0 on the weekend as they defeated players from Cornell, Seton Hall, and West Point. Playing #1 singles, Casner
was named MVP of the tournament. Playing at her usual #3 position, senior Claire Cheatwood finished a strong 2-1, losing
only to her counterpart from Cornell. Lastly, at Cornell, the #3 doubles team of Brenna Tindall and Katie Coykendall won
their flight.

On September 19-20, the Cats were at N.C. State as they faced their toughest competition of the fall. The field
included ACC powers UVA, UNC, and N.C. State, University of Richmond, and conference foes ETSU and UNC-G. In the second
flight, Cheatwood and Tindall finished in 6th and 7th places respectively. Also, freshman Whitney Boykin was the recipient of the
Sportsmanship Award for the tournament.

These fall tournaments are generally used in an attempt to gauge a team’s potential and talent. After these three tournaments,
it is clear to see that the Cats are blessed in both. As long as Casner and Bradford are healthy
and can play, and the freshmen keep contributing, the team should once again be a force in the Southern Conference.
