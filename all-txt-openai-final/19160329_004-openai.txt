4 The DAVIDSONIAN, March 29, 1916

TRACK TEAM BEGINS PRACTICE

A good many men have joined the track squad and Coach Kluttz has been giving them a light workout each
afternoon. The work of rebuilding the old track has been pushed during the past week, and it is now in
much better condition. Davidson will be especially well represented in the dashes and long-distance runs. Captain Morrison, Ives, Mattison, M.
McKinnon, and Crouch are showing up well in the dashes, and W. A. Johnson, A. G. Finley, and Brand are
good long-distance men. In the other departments, some of the men who show much promise are: Hurdles, McAlister and Worth;
high jump, Perry, W. B. Crouch, Boggs, McAlister, and Poole; pole vault, Perry, Boggs, Brand, and W. B. Crouch. In
the weight events, Gray, Poole, and Knight should make good men. It is too early to make predictions as to
the particular stars, but with the wealth of material already out, Davidson should have at least three good men in
every event.

DR. GURNEY SPEAKS AT Y. M. C. A. MEETING

Dr. H. E. Gurney, pastor of the Presbyterian church at Monroe, spoke to the Y.M.C.A. on Thursday night, taking as
his subject, “The Spiritual Birth.” He chose as his text John 3:6, “That which is born of the flesh is
flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.” Dr. Gurney divided the whole race of mankind into
two classes: the unregenerate and the regenerate. The unregenerate class experience one birth, the physical birth, and two deaths, the
physical and the spiritual. On the other hand, the regenerate class experience the natural birth and also the spiritual birth,
but only one death, which is the natural death. It is the spiritual birth by which we pass from death
to life. Sin, said the speaker, is a separation from God, while conversion is a change whereby we draw ourselves
back toward God. The spiritual birth, or conversion, comes by two means: first, a regeneration in the man; second, by
the working of the Spirit in him.

NEW FRATERNITY HALLS

In accordance with the regulation that all fraternity halls must be removed from Chambers building, work on the new halls
is being rushed, in order to complete them before commencement. The Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity will occupy one-half of Elm
Row. The partition between two rooms will be removed, leaving a spacious hall. The Beta Theta Pi will occupy a
portion of Oak Row, while the new Sigma Alpha Epsilon hall will be on the first floor of the Eumenean
Society building, in what was formerly the old “D” room. The contractors are rushing all these halls to completion, and
when finished they will be beautiful and modern in every respect. The new halls with the old ones will form
a “Fraternity quadrangle.”

VISIT OF EXPERT GOLFERS

Monday afternoon the Davidson Golf club was given the rare opportunity of seeing a really famous golfer in action. Mr.
Carl Anderson, professional connected with Wright and Ditson Company, accompanied by Mr. Scott, of Boston, played an eighteen-hole match with
some local players. Mr. Anderson and Professor Woods as partners played Dr. J. M. McConnell and J. W. Clark in
a foursome. After eighteen holes of ragged but close golf, the match ended two points in favor of the professional
and Professor Woods.

BASEBALL SEASON OPENS

(Continued from page 1)

The most ideal, but considering the chilly weather, the game was fairly fast. Spencer Cranford handled the indicator and gave
mutual satisfaction. The line-up and score follow:

OUR NEXT GAMES.
The second baseball game of the season will be played on the local field tomorrow afternoon with Oak Ridge, one
of Davidson's old rivals. The Oak Ridge boys have always given the Davidson lads a lively tussle, and have several
times gone away with the laurels. The Red and Black will do all in its power to get revenge for
its defeat two seasons ago. The visitors come with a strong team and one that has a number of last
year's veterans. In the opening game of the season, they won from the Carolina team, which proves their worth. There
will probably be some changes in tomorrow's line-up, in the light of the Catawba game. The pitchers will probably be
either Lawson or Hengeveld, as Davidson will be called upon to put forth her best material to come off victorious.
The Red and Black team goes to Charlotte Saturday for a game with Wake Forest. The team is getting into
good shape and will go with the intent of reaping vengeance for last year's defeat. A lively game should be
the result.

DR. FULTON TO SPEAK AT GASTONIA
On the evening of April 13th, Dr. Fulton will lecture before the meeting of the State Library Association, in Gastonia.
It will be an illustrated lecture on “Shakespeare and Stratford,” showing pictures of Shakespeare’s birthplace, the Ann Hathaway cottage, the
church in which Shakespeare is buried, and many other slides equally interesting. The Shakespeare evening was planned in order that
the Association and the people of Gastonia might share in the nationwide celebration of the Shakespeare tercentenary.
