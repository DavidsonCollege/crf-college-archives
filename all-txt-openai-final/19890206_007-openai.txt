**UNC-W soars past Cats**

By BRUCE NEWSOME

The Davidson basketball team fell to the University of North Carolina at Wilmington Seahawks 81-68 in their first game back from their Florida road trip.

The Cats were hurt by an off night by Bruce Elder, who struggled by shooting 3 for 15 from the field as a whole and 1 for 8 from 3-point range. He only had 7 points which was 10 points below his season average.

Davidson also missed Paul Drobnitch who was ill for his third straight game. His absence hampered the depth at the power forward and center positions.

After being down by 7 points early in the contest, Davidson came back to tie the game at 21-21 midway through the first half. This run was led by the strong inside play of Jay Schmitt, Dick Seidel, Mo Gray, and Bill Sellers.

However, with 5:18 left in the first half, Jay Schmitt was called for an offensive foul which was his third foul of the game. With Schmitt out of the lineup, the Seahawks went on an 11-0 run.

Paul Denmond finally stopped the run with a three-pointer with 1:36 left, but UNC-W still took a 38-30 lead into the locker room at halftime.

At the start of the second half, head coach Bobby Hussey started Gray in place of Bill Sellers. This move paid off at the offensive end as Gray scored 8 straight points as Davidson scored on 6 of their first 7 possessions.

At the same time though, the Seahawks scored on 9 of their first 10 possessions to take a 59-47 lead at the 10:00 minute mark of the second half.

They stretched the lead to 68-49 with 6:57 left before Davidson made a mini-run. This run pulled the Cats within 14 with 4:35 left.

However, Davidson could get no closer than 13 as UNC-W made 5 out of 7 free throws in the final 3:11, and the Seahawks went home with an 81-68 victory to up their record to 10-9 while the struggling Wildcats fell to 6-16.

The Cats were led in scoring by Gray with 17 as he tries to regain the starting job that he lost during Christmas break. However, the only other Wildcat to score in double figures was Schmitt with 10 and 8 of those came in the first half before he got into serious foul trouble.

Last weekend, the Wildcats traveled to the Sunshine State to take on Florida International and Central Florida.

Thursday’s 91-84 loss to Florida International saw Bruce Elder rack up season highs of 33 points and 15 rebounds. Davidson was down by as much as 28 but rallied back to within five in the final 10 seconds. Paul Denmond was the only other Wildcat in double figures with 10 points.

Saturday, Davidson got its first road win on a non-neutral court with a 91-83 win over Central Florida.

The Wildcats, up by 17 at halftime, got a quick 3-pointer from Elder to open up the second half to go up 60-40. From there, they never looked back.

“This was our best transition game of the year,” said head coach Bobby Hussey. He had a reason to be pleased because Davidson shot an improved 53 percent from the floor and had five players in double figures. Alan Hunter led the Cats with 14.

After a game with Appalachian State on Thursday, Davidson plays on the road February 8 at Northern Illinois and returns home to Johnston Gym on Saturday the 11th to take on William and Mary.

**The times that try (wo)men’s souls**

By HAP BRYANT

The first “Around the Horn” column this year addressed the issues of the changing Davidson sports scene. Entitled “The times that try men’s souls,” it asked questions about the different perceptions on Davidson athletics.

Since that time, one problem has apparently been solved—namely, the football program’s status. With the recent trustee decision to move gradually to Division II in football, the college hopes that the football situation will stabilize.

However, the athletic administration has not yet found a conference affiliation, so some of the same problems confront Davidson today as they did back in September.

Another issue, possibly much more damaging to the college from financial and ethical standpoints, is the treatment of women’s athletics.

Before I say anything else, I must admit a bit of chauvinism on this topic. I would much rather watch men’s basketball than women’s basketball, I prefer baseball over women’s volleyball, and I feel more comfortable watching a football game than I do watching a field hockey game.

My prejudices aside, I still believe that women’s athletics deserves a fair shake. Obviously, Davidson is denying women’s athletics an equal share of its athletic pie.

Allow me to illustrate how unfair I think the current situation is.

My sister is a sophomore in high school. Now, if she were inclined to volleyball or field hockey or track (which she doesn’t seem to be), I would tell her to forget about coming to Davidson.

I wouldn’t want her coming to a place that discriminates against her kind.

The college’s attitude appears to parallel that of the Charlotte alumnus who recently wrote a letter to The Charlotte Observer with the headline “Davidson going female.” He argued that Davidson is losing its identity.
