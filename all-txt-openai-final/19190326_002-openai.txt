**Editorial**

This will be the last issue of The Davidsonian that the present staff will put out. In looking back over
the year, we realize fully that the paper has not been what it should or could have been, yet considering
the conditions which have existed during the past twelve months, we feel we have done what we could. Plans have
been formulated which should make The Davidsonian bigger and better under the new staff, to whom our sincere sympathy and
best wishes are extended.

**Commencement**

It is just two months off. To some it comes as an event long looked forward to; to others as
a time of mere enjoyment; to still others as a release from confinement on the campus. Unfortunately, the majority of
the student body look on it in this last light. Why is it that so few students stay for commencement?
Whoever will answer this satisfactorily and suggest some plausible remedy will have done the college a great service. The Davidsonian
will be glad to publish any discussion of this question, which is a knotty problem facing all. Is it a
change in temperament of the student or a lack of attraction in the exercises themselves?

**Faculty and Students**

One of the most unfortunate conditions which exist in the American college of today is the tendency toward estrangement, and
consequently misunderstanding, between Faculty and Student Body. Somehow the student often forgets that the professor is human, and the professor
often forgets that the student exists. The student thinks of the professor as unfeeling and uninterested in student affairs, picturing
the faculty even as antagonistic sometimes to student interests. Consequently, the student assumes, and envelops himself in, an attitude of
hostility, which he foolishly thinks is mutual. He tends to foster this feeling through campus gossip, though with no grounds
for his statements. Thus many students go through college without that intimate acquaintance with the professors, which is an invaluable
education in itself.

**The Davidsonian, March 26, 1919**

As cordial and intimate as is the relation between professor and student at Davidson, yet there is an unreasonable gulf
between Faculty and Student Body as wholes. It is not a condition that has arisen of late, but has been
prevalent in all times, and in almost all colleges. It is not the fault of either. Faculty and Student Body
are so set apart, that somehow they have no free means of communication with one another. The Student Body has
no lawful way to express its approval or disapproval of any actions taken by the Faculty; and the Faculty has
no way to find out the sentiment or opinion of the Student Body on such subjects. We do not presume
to say that students could match their opinions against the ripened judgment of Faculty members, yet the Student Body as
a whole has the best interests of the college at heart, and should exert some influence at least in matters
of interest to itself. Less hasty judgment on the part of students and more of a spirit of fair consideration
would result in a cooperation on the campus which could not help but prove an asset to the college.

**For the Small College**

Another argument for the small college is found...in the accusation that: students of American colleges and universities have been Germanized
through too much specialization on the part of the men and women who taught them. The accusation comes from Professor
Holliday, of the University of Montana. The American institutions have been following the lead of the German universities, and like
all copying have had all of the bad features while the meritorious ones have been lacking. The specialization has made
the professors lose sight of the big issues which underlie their little corner of research. “The condition of a college
which has a special teacher to teach each tiny branch of the subject and nothing but that is like the
shoe factory of today in which there is not a man who can make a whole shoe. Besides all that,
the specialized professor has at his command so much technical lingo that none can understand him. Because of this, Professor
Holliday advises the abolition of all learned societies. He says that from his knowledge, graduates of today are mentally lopsided
because too many young Ph.D.'s see nothing but their desire to become graduate professors. In recommending a change, Professor Holliday
says that men who teach should have had considerable training in several correlated fields in order that they give a
broad survey of the entire situation. Surely that is a recommendation for the teaching in a smaller institution. Professor Holliday
says that students of today have lost the vision of the stu-

Gave a look so ecstatic and answered emphatic,

“We all admit that a postage stamp can be licked. Even at that, you have got to do the job
behind its back. But a stamp never knows when it’s licked. Placed on a piece of mail, its one object
is to deliver the goods at a prescribed destination. And that is exactly what it does. Thru storm and flood,
wreck and disaster, it hangs on and never lets go. It sticks until it gets there."—Ex.

How many of us stick until we get there? Circumstances of far less importance than floods and disasters sweep us
off of our feet. Why? Because we haven't the grit and backbone to stick. We throw up the sponge before
the fight has begun, and say we can’t before we have tried to see if we could. The world is
full of men and women of this stigma. But those whom we all admire and want to imitate are the
ones who say to circumstance, “So you will break me, will you? We will see. I am going to see
this thing thru. I am going to get such strength from overcoming my difficulties that they will make me.” The
fellow who never knows he is licked, whose one object is to deliver the goods, who hangs on thru all
difficulties is the fellow who has got old man S. O. L. backed up in the corner and the other
green-eyed monsters begging for mercy.
