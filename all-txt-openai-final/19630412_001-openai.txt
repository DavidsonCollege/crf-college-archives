‘November Requiem’ Wins Excellent Rating At UNC

The Vagabonds

Davidson undertakings and plans for ‘November Requiem,’ a one-act play by sophomore Bill Trotter of Charlotte, was presented as part
of the original plays division of the Carolina Playmakers Festival. The Festival was held during spring vacation at the University
of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. Trotter’s play was awarded two ratings of “Excellent,” which is one of the highest
ratings given at the festival. The rating of “Excellent” was given to the play for acting and for production. A
student from the University of Florida playing the lead in Trotter's drama was especially commended for his acting ability. The
next in the series of original one-act plays by Davidson students will be presented at Hudson Hall on April 16
and 17. The last play in the contest this year will be a one-act drama by Steve Clark, a senior
from Winston-Salem.

‘The first major production by the Vagabonds this year will be given on May 14 at Hudson Hall, Cunningham Fine
Arts Center. The play is George Bernard Shaw’s Arms and the Man. The presentation of this play is under the
supervision and direction of Professor W. E. Talley of the English Department. Talley said of this play, “It should be
recognized that this is not a universal light play or triviality. Arms and the Man is one of the striking
triumphs of a major creative figure in English literature. It is hostile to plays like Winterset, The Adding Machine, and
The Man Who Came to Dinner, a work of satire. And it is of more than all the mental and
literary nature.” Concerning his ideas behind the play, author G. B. Shaw, speaking of “the general onslaught on idealism which
is implicit, and indeed explicit, in Arms and the Man,” remarks that “idealism, which is only a flattering name for
romanticism in politics and morals, is as mischievous to men as romanticism in ethics and religion.”

problem. The striking triumphs of a major creative figure. President D. Grier Martin said that there has been a trickle
of the effects of the student talent. There has been no discipline for a long time. "It's been something we've
talked about over the years," he said. The first announcement of the previous had attention cast a lot indefinitely after
the treaty. Therefore, on Tuesday, April 6, at 11:00, the resolution will give a student the choice of attending the
Sunday evening vespers service at the Davidson College Presbyterian Church or attending the Sunday morning worship service of a local
church.

A recent call to the administration for a change in the policy has been met with approval. President Martin stated
that the requirement at Davidson has always been to guide a student to attend the church of his choice in
Davidson. He stressed that the institution would only apply to the churches in Davidson. The option program for vespers will
not go into effect until next year. After a year's evaluation, the faculty will scrutinize the system before renewing, improving,
or abolishing it.

The college has always been independent and has had speakers and discussions on various topics. The new policy allows a
student to choose any church in Davidson on Sunday morning. It is hoped that the attendance of vespers can be
maintained. When the new policy becomes effective, Chaplain Taws was consulted and had no objections to the program. Dr. Ties
Montfort, minister of the Davidson Methodist Church, expressed his approval of the resolution. "I have been very much in favor
of this for several years," he said. "I've had some real questions about compulsory vespers." Montfort also said that the
policy might rekindle interest in regularly attending chapel services, especially among new students.

Many students have expressed their opinions on the new policy. Some feel that the administration should have consulted with the
students before making such a significant change. Others believe that the new policy will allow for more freedom and personal
responsibility in their religious practices.

Study Of Marxism

The YMCA is conducting a study of Marxism. The study began last Wednesday and will continue for three weeks with
weekly discussions. The book "The Marxists," by the late C. Wright Mills, is being used as a source. Dr. B.F.
Patterson described Mills as "perhaps one of the most outstanding sociologists in the United States." He worked on the book
to find the truth. Patterson feels that the study will give students an objective view of different systems of thought.
The discussions are intended to help students search for as much of the truth as any system of thought may
contain.

Last Wednesday's discussion was on the place of Marxism in the world and the general Marxist theory. Next week, the
topic will be on Marx's theory of history, and the last one will be on his economic theory.

Howard Arbuckle, a member of the Honor Court, has been elected as the chairman for the coming year. Recently, he
has been active in various student activities and has been appointed to the Student Council. He has also been involved
in track and other leadership roles.

Eudora Welty Proclaims She Spent the Day Walking

Eudora Welty arrived on campus at 10:00 a.m. Monday morning, a day before her scheduled talk during the service. Her
visit marked a break from the usual series of Book-of-the-Year speakers who have visited the campus in the past. During
her stay, fireworks were set off over the campus. Her soft-spoken presence touched the students in a still, vibrant way.
She showed a warmth and sincerity which spoke louder than words.

Her Craft

Miss Welty's book was "Selected Short Stories." She spent the day walking quietly and observing the life around her. Her
visit to the campus was marked by a sense of calm and reflection. She gave generously of herself, and students
will long remember her soft-spoken charm.
