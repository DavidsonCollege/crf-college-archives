When Coach Rich DeSelm arrived at Davidson in the summer of '93, he inherited a swimming and diving program that was struggling to stay afloat, no pun intended. The once strong Davidson swimming and diving team had fallen on hard times, and DeSelm had little to work with. That began to change immediately. DeSelm went to work in the all-important battle of recruiting. In his first full season as Davidson’s coach, he brought in the best recruiting class that Davidson had seen in years. That class, the Class of ‘98, represents a true turning point in the swimming and diving program. They are the best senior class that Davidson has had in years.

As is the case with most sports at Davidson, many student-athletes have decided to become just students. Of over a dozen members of the Class of ‘98 who joined the swimming team upon entering Davidson, five remain. Three seniors were on the men’s team this season — Freddy Schnell, Dave Maddux, and Matt Lake. For the women, two competed through their senior season. Those were Allison Beebe and Mary Noel George.

Beebe has competed for four seasons in freestyle, backstroke, and butterfly. In her junior season, she swam the last leg of the 400 medley relay team that set a school record. She is also on the teams that hold the records for 200, 400, and 800 freestyle relay. Beebe and her teammates set all three of these records this season. In her rookie season, Beebe set the record in the 1000 freestyle. That record, like many others, has since been broken by other solid classes that DeSelm has recruited. Junior co-captain Kathleen Paffenroth broke Beebe’s record in November of her own rookie season.

Mary Noel George did not enter Davidson with the Class of ‘98. After spending her freshman year at St. Louis University, she transferred to Davidson and joined the squad to compete in her sophomore season. She has remained on the roster since then and has had a great impact on the team, so much so that she was chosen as a co-captain for her final season. In addition to her role on the relay teams, George specialized in sprint freestyle. The day after her 200 freestyle relay record was broken, George inscribed her name in the record books once again when her relay team set a new record in the 200 medley relay.

The impact of this senior class has been noticeable. Members of the Class of ‘98 hold four standing individual records. Furthermore, every record-holding relay team includes at least one member of the Class of ‘98, and three of them include two.

Matt Lake had an instant impact at Davidson in his rookie season as a competitor in breaststroke and individual medley. In his junior season, Lake led the ‘Cats to victory at Southern States by claiming three individual titles and one relay title. Lake is a member of two record-holding relay teams. He swam on the 200 and 400 medley relay teams which set school records on back-to-back days this February. Lake’s skill in breaststroke is second to only one other swimmer in Wildcat history. Lake has several times come within an eyelash of breaking the school records in the 100 and 200 breaststroke. Both of those records were set during Lake’s rookie season by Matt Buck.

Buck entered Davidson as a member of the Class of ‘98 and has since been a standout performer. He holds the records in the 100 and 200 breaststroke.

She has been a crucial part of freestyle and butterfly events. In her first season as a Wildcat, she finished third at Southern States in the 100 butterfly. She was also a member of the relay teams. Of the five relay teams that hold Davidson records, Beebe is a member of four. The fact that his records still stand despite an ever-improving Davidson program is a testament to his own strength and the strength of DeSelm’s first recruiting class.

Dave Maddux’s most important contribution to the team has been his leadership. After a sophomore season in which he was voted the most improved swimmer, his teammates elected him as team captain for two years. As a middle-distance freestyle swimmer, Maddux is a member of one record-holding medley relay team and is also on all three record-holding freestyle relay teams. Along with Lake, Maddux helped set the record in the 400 medley relay earlier this season. He is the lone senior on the 200 freestyle relay team that set a record on the same day. Maddux is one of two members of the Class of ‘98 on the record-holding 800 freestyle relay team. The other is Michael Scarbo, who was on the roster in his freshman and sophomore seasons. This record has stood since February of Maddux’s sophomore season. Maddux’s relay team set the record for the 400 freestyle relay in March of his junior year. Maddux shares the diving record with fellow senior Freddy Schnell.

Schnell has arguably been the most successful member of the Class of ‘98. He has contributed primarily in backstroke and freestyle. Schnell’s skill was demonstrated at Southern States his junior season when he posted top eight finishes in three individual and two relay events. He also has held records in the 100 and 200 backstroke. Both of Schnell’s backstroke records were broken this season by sophomore Terry Dolch, another prize recruit of the DeSelm era. Last season, Schnell had a top-eight finish in the 200 backstroke at the ECACs. Over the course of that year, he also earned individual victories in the 1000 freestyle in four meets.

The record books show how much progress the swimming and diving program has made since the Class of ‘98 arrived on campus four years ago. Only two men and one woman not recruited by DeSelm still hold Davidson records. DeSelm’s recruits hold 28 of the 36 individual records in swimming and diving. The remaining eight are split between only three swimmers. Of the ten record-holding relay teams, only one has a swimmer not recruited by DeSelm. Every Davidson record has been broken since DeSelm arrived on campus, the majority of them by swimmers that he recruited. Eleven of the women’s records were set this season, along with eight of the men’s.

Next season should be no different. The women’s team will return six individual record-holders, and the men five. Many members of record-holding relay teams will be on the roster as well, including three rising sophomores on the women’s squad. At this pace, all of the records held by members of the Class of ‘98 will fall within a few seasons. Yet, there is no shame in that. That class set enough records in their day. They rejuvenated a program that had almost fallen apart and began a new era of winning in Davidson swimming and diving. Back-to-back Southern States titles for both squads should be enough to show that.
