This past weekend, the men’s track team once again defied history and exceeded expectations. This season has been shaping up
as the best track and field season in many years at Davidson, and this weekend showed that a new era
has arrived. Fueled by the loud cheers, physical races, and tight turns at VMI’s Cormack Field House, the men’s track
team posted 18 points (7th place) at the 1999 Southern Conference Indoor Championships, held February 19-20. It was the highest
recorded point total in many seasons, and the most since head coach Gary Andrew’s arrival in 1986. (The 1971 squad
has the highest point total ever for Davidson, finishing in 4th place with 20 points). Western Carolina won their first
indoor crown since joining the SoCon, scoring 159.5 points, outdistancing runner-up Appalachian State (139.5 points). Host VMI claimed the third-place
spot with 108 points.

Friday’s events saw Michael Albert run a Wildcat Top Ten Performance in the 55m, finishing in :06.81 seconds. Addam Marcotte
also competed, running a :06.90. Albert continued to lead the sprint group during the weekend, as he posted a time
of :54.01 in the 400m. Freshman Grant Bleecher sped to a :55.52, with John Moore just behind him in :56.45.
Co-Captain Stan Baker completed the 400m crew, placing in :57.02. Marcotte also competed in the 200m (:24.72), in addition to
Baker’s performance (:25.39).

Brent Ferrell started off the scoring barrage in the 3000m, placing 7th overall in a top ten school time of
8:52.04. Frosh wonder Dan Gibson continued his impressive rookie season with a 9:08.50, while junior Pat Burchett (running just behind
Gibson) posted his indoor PR (9:10.08). Freshman Paul Irwin completed his 3000m with a time of 9:35.37. Keith Chapman and
Davey Bacon provided the most excitement for the day in the preliminaries of the 800m, as both advanced through to
the finals. Although not continuing with them, Jay Jahnes, David Vaughn, and Jonathan Fly also ran the 800m, finishing with
times of 2:07.64, 2:10.48, and 2:15.13 respectively. The close to the first day of the meet witnessed the distance medley
relay.

A successful and exhilarating weekend brought the women’s indoor track season to a close. The team traveled to Lexington, VA,
where they competed in the Southern Conference Indoor Championships at V.M.I. Beating both Wofford and the Citadel, the Lady Wildcats
placed 7th with 11 points, the highest score Davidson has had since 1992.

Spread out over the course of two days, the running events began on Friday with the 3000 meters. Seniors Jenny
Klotz (11:48), Beth Brewster (12:33), Katie Lannon (12:36), and freshman Hannah Grimes (11:48) represented Davidson with four solid races. Following
this quartet was senior Jamilah Sawyer racing the 55-meter hurdle prelims. Sawyer advanced to the finals where she earned Davidson
three points with her sensational sixth place finish. Also advancing to the finals in the 800 meters was sophomore Smyth
Bitter who placed 9th overall. Freshmen Julia Kudravetz (2:36) and Rhiannon Ollis (2:38) and seniors Janet Aardema (2:41) and Tab
Combs (2:59) all ran a strong 800 meters as well. The last event of Friday was the DMR (Distance Medley
Relay), which consists of a 1200, 400, 800, and 1600 meters, was run by Lucy Billingsley, Jamilah Sawyer, Clare Frey,
and Smyth Bitter, respectively. With a phenomenal third place finish, the foursome not only had an All-Southern Conference performance but
they shattered the school record with a 12:45.16. This third place finish brought in Davidson’s first six points of the
weekend.

Saturday’s racing was launched into action with the 1600 meter raced by Bitter (5:23), Billingsley (5:26), Frey (5:28), and senior
Ellen Runnels (6:20). Bitter, Billingsley, and Frey placed 10th, 12th, and 13th overall, respectively. Klotz, Brewster, and Lannon braved out
yet another lengthy race in the 5000 meters—25 laps around the indoor track. With a time of 20:32, Klotz raced
her personal best for an indoor 5K. Wrapping up the weekend’s competition were studs Billingsley, Frey, Ollis, and Sawyer in
the 4x400 meter relay. The relay team earned two points with a strong 7th place finish. Coach Cason comments, “This
was the strongest team showing since 1992. It was a great meet for our team. I can’t wait until the
outdoor season when our team will continue to improve.” The forte of Caroline Little and Wendy Legerton, both talented freshmen,
was sorely missed this weekend. Throwers Yolanda Kirby and Kristy Noesges and sprinter Machelle Borders will also bring strength and
depth to the team as they join the group for outdoor track.Team of Keith Gordon, Michael Albert, Jay Jahnes, and
Thomas McElveen placed 6th overall with a total PORTS time of 11:06.07, also one of the top ten times in
school history. Saturday’s events were kicked off with the triple jump. Competing in his first ever TJ, junior Ade Artis
provided yet another Wildcat spark, placing 6th overall and breaking the school record with a jump of 43’ 4 1/2”.
The scoring then continued with the 800m finals. Despite the physical race, Davey Bacon and Keith Chapman placed 6th and
7th for the Cats, with times of 2:03.20 and 2:03.25. The ‘Cats shined, too, in the mile. Dan Gibson was
fastest for the team, running a 4:32.98. Thomas McElveen put in a solid performance with a 4:38.71, while Pat Burchett
ran a 4:41.16. Paul Irwin and Gordon also competed in the mile, running 4:49.16 and 4:54.60 respectively. Brent Ferrell added
to the point total with his 7th place finish in the 5000m, running a top ten school performance of 15:34.70.
The 4x400m relay team of Michael Albert, Keith Chapman, Dan Gibson, and Grant Bleecher ended the successful meet with a
time of 3:36.45, good enough for 7th place. Nic Crider (individual champion in the 3000m, 5000m, and runner-up in the
mile) garnered Performer-of-the-Year honors, while Jeremy Carter of Western Carolina was the Freshman-of-the-Year. Danny Williamson of WCU was also named
Coach-of-the-Year. The men hope to continue this breakthrough season into the outdoor campaign. Their first meet is the 49er Opener,
scheduled for March 13 at UNC Charlotte.

Commentary By Sean Davis Arts and Living Editor / Sports Columnist

For me, Roger Clemens’ story is a story of childhood. It is a story of a boy who needed a
hero and found one in a Red Sox uniform. It is not a new story, but one worth repeating in
an era far removed from the days when baseball was simply a game. I admit that my memories of baseball
are not from these days. Maybe my image of the early years of baseball is clouded by Field of Dreams
and Ken Burns’ documentaries. I’m not sure why we need heroes, but I do know that a six-year-old kid in
Tampa, Florida was caught up in the midst of an unfortunate year and needed an outlet. Months in a body
cast can really irritate a kid. Your body itches all the time and there isn’t a thing that you can
do about it. When you’re not thinking about the itching in your cast, you sit around and watch television. Cartoons,
in the end, just can’t cut it. So I turned to baseball for something to do. My dad had always
been a fan of sports in general, so having a baseball game on television was normal. The clincher, though, was
the fact that my new first-grade teacher was Roger Clemens’ sister-in-law. She got “the Rocket” to sign a baseball card
for me.

For me, I put that card in a shiny plastic casing and kept it with me. It still hangs up
on the wall in my room back home. I memorized every letter of that card. I asked my dad for
a pack of baseball cards every time he went out. Like I said, this story is not a new one.
Card collecting was an epidemic that infected many of my friends as well. Most of us grew out of it.
We eventually moved on to middle school, where our weekends were no longer spent trading cards. We had the arcades
to hang out at, girls to start thinking about, and, in the end, Mortal Kombat and the Middle School Holiday
Dance got the best of us. I drifted away from baseball. Maybe the country did as well. Michael was winning
his championships. The strike split baseball in two. But I always looked through the sports section to see how my
hero’s arm was holding up. In 1996 he was traded to the Blue Jays. I was crushed. My Red Sox
hat, which I had kept for ten years and which still fit, seemed useless. Roger was a Red Sox. I
was convinced—somewhere it was written as a law. But Clemens moved on, and I smiled when he won his fourth
and fifth Cy Young awards. See, Don Duquette, I told you so! Still, the events of the last few days
have proven that Clemens is not a Blue Jay.

But to think of days gone by, I can’t help but feel a bit nostalgic. I don’t know what number
he will wear, but I’ll hazard a guess that his arm will follow him to New York. A championship may
be waiting there for him. He has won five Cy Young awards. Someday his name will stand in the Hall.
For me, none of that will top off his status as a great pitcher. What can I say? I’m still
a six-year-old kid. When Roger gets on the mound, my leg stops itching.
