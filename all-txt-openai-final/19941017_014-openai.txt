**Football team ends drought with 9-6 victory**

By Will Cobb

Davidson finally got the monkey off their back on Saturday with a hard-fought victory on the road against Methodist College,
9-6. The Wildcats held on to their three-point lead as both teams were held scoreless in the second half. Due
to circumstances and a struggling offense, Head Coach Tim Landis used six players on both sides of the field. Two
of those players made big impacts en route to the Wildcats' first victory of the season.

Senior Chris Leak has taken up the tailback duties in addition to playing linebacker, scoring the winning touchdown on a
four-yard run. Leak ended up the day with 86 yards on 34 carries. Another versatile player included junior defensive end
Bo Bartholomew, who lined up as the fullback on offense. Bartholomew served as lead blocker for Leak and ended the
Monarchs’ chances for a victory with a quarterback sack on third down and four with 18 seconds left in the
game.

The Wildcats got on the scoreboard in the first quarter when sophomore outside linebacker A.R. Barrington blocked a Methodist punt
out of the end zone to put the Wildcats up 2-0. The Monarchs answered with a touchdown in the second
quarter, but the extra point was blocked. Davidson scored the last points of the game on Leak’s touchdown run. Senior
Sean Callahan remained perfect on the season with the extra point.

The team’s MVP would have to be the defensive line, holding the Monarchs to less than one yard per carry
(35 yards on 37 carries). Methodist managed just 112 yards of total offense and seven first downs on the afternoon.
The offense has continued to sputter as the Wildcats managed just 157 yards themselves. The quarterback situation still remains undecided
as senior Kevin Holzworth and freshman Hamilton Hill continue to split time. Davidson will travel to Randolph-Macon seeking their second
win of the season next Saturday. The team’s final home game will be during Parent’s Weekend on November 5.

**Women's cross country has best meet of season**

By Erin Roach

This weekend, the Davidson Wildcats traveled to McAlpine Park in Charlotte for the North Carolina Intercollegiate Cross Country Championships, their
most challenging meet thus far in the season. The women, who have been enjoying their most successful season ever, wanted
to show everyone else in the state just how much they have been improving. After a very disappointing 14th place
finish at this meet last year, the women knew they could do better and came to the meet Saturday ready
to run their hardest.

The Wildcats, who have been training intensely all season long, were ready to reap the benefits of their hard work.
This is exactly what they did on Saturday. Each member planned to run her best time so far this season
at the meet, and the team tried to work together to accomplish that goal. But it would take more than
that to get the women to do really well, and except for a last-minute fiasco at the starting line, everything
fell into place for the women.

After the gun sounded, the women used the competition to help push them along. They ran their first mile with
blistering speed and all concentrated on improving their positions as they attacked the hill on the second mile. Although the
runners were feeling exhausted at the final mile mark, the fabulous Davidson cheering section helped give the Wildcats the energy
they needed to finish strong.

Personal records for the season abounded, just as the women had hoped. Elizabeth Bishop led the Wildcats and tore up
the course with a phenomenal 19:08. Erin Roach, Stephanie Moses, and Laura Jordan all also ran well, clocking times of
19:23, 19:37, and 20:05, respectively. The rest of the Wildcats ran consistently, all having great performances. In the team results,
the Wildcats were excited with an 8th place finish and were psyched with their improvement over previous finishes. The Wildcats’
next meet is the Southern Conference Championships, which has been their focus all season.

**Volleyball team down, but not out since match-filled fall break**

By Traci Cliett

The Davidson volleyball team had anything but a restful fall break. While we were all relaxing on our vacations, the
volleyball team played three intense matches against Furman, Mercer, and Georgia Southern. Davidson fell to Furman and Georgia Southern, which...were
both conference matches. However, they defeated Mercer in a decided victory. Since fall break, Davidson's schedule has not gotten any
easier, but they are still quite positive about their performance. Last Friday, they were defeated by ETSU at home. And
last Saturday, Davidson lost two matches on the road to Hofstra and East Carolina. Both matches were extremely close, as
has been the case the past few weeks; most matches have gone five games. Senior Lorie Logan attributes the team's
losses to the number of injuries they have now. But Logan believes, “We are pulling together as a team” to
get through these losses. Junior Michele Augustin feels the team played well over fall break because they played together. She
thinks these “rough times are to be expected because our coach is changing the lineup due to the injuries.” Michele
knows that “it is difficult to put players in new positions and expect them to do well right away.” The
Davidson volleyball team takes on Winthrop at home on Wednesday night.

Ever since the fifties when it was invented, frisbee has been a source of entertainment to young and old at
picnics in the park, family reunions, and as a way to pass a long Saturday afternoon. Recently, however, a new
style of frisbee has been slowly emerging across the nation in which this pastime is becoming a competitive sport. Davidson
has gotten caught up in this wave, and many students are trying to form an Ultimate Frisbee club team. Interested
students have been meeting for the past month three or four days a week to practice. If approved, the club
team would be open to both males and females. In order to get a club team approved, the P.E. department
requires there to be an organized interest present for at least a year before funds can be provided for the
team. Currently, the team is officially taking attendance at every practice. The list of players has grown to 40. Practice
usually lasts for an hour and consists of organized pick-up games in order to learn the rules, see the skill
level, and determine who’s really interested in playing.

“We don’t unrealistically hope to become a varsity sport,” says senior J.D. Semones. “But, if the interest is there—which it
is—we hope to become a club team and play other club teams in the area.” There are many rules that
the team must learn in order to be ready to compete. “This is new for everyone, but we are excited
about it and people are willing to learn,” said freshman Dave Kearfolt, who began playing frisbee in a competitive manner
in Richmond when his high school cross country coach had his team play as a warm-up. The game is played
on a field similar to a football field. It is 70 feet long with 25-foot end zones. Usually, seven people
play at a time and throw a frisbee that is between 155 and 175 grams; the heavier the frisbee, the
better. The frisbee can only advance in the air and once you catch it, you have ten seconds to throw
it. You can’t move while you have the frisbee in your hand. If the frisbee is dropped or deflected and
hits the ground, it is automatically the other team’s. The other team can play immediately, even on an interception. This
keeps the game constantly moving.

“Due to the fact that you are constantly running, this can be an exhausting sport,” says Kearfolt. The key to
the game is being able to switch from offense to defense quickly. Usually, a man-to-man style defense is played. On
the upper levels, there are plays for offense, but college and high school teams usually just go by the basic
rules of thumb. A team is awarded one point for scoring in the end zone. Most of the time, winning
is achieved by reaching a set score, not by competing for a set amount of time and achieving the highest
score.

Ultimate Frisbee is a varsity men’s and women’s sport in states such as Colorado, Washington, and Arizona. There is a
national tournament held each year in various cities and the United States won the last Ultimate Frisbee Championship against England.
The sport is spreading to the East coast, and Duke, Wake Forest, and UVA reportedly have teams. “We’re not that
caliber yet,” says Kearfolt, “but we’re getting help from outsiders who have played before, and we hope to become competitive.”
