Me - i : srr ae es in Raleigh on Saturday nightCats Weary Lane: The last week produced several upsets.
The case has been entered in the Jinw! 20 Frederick St. Wt ld Ki t pass. The Wolfpack, upset last
week by The Citadel, encountered the Flying Squadron at Lexington and lost to V.P.I. 56-41. The Cats showed the effects
of the four-game schedule.

Playing before a large crowd in Winston-Salem, the Cat Cagers lost to V.P.I. 56-41. The Cats showed the effects of
the four-game schedule. The Wildkittens were defeated in a preliminary match by the V.P.I. with a score of 18-16, bringing
their loop record to two wins and four losses.

The Deacs Go North: During this week, Wake Forest invaded the North, encountering Villanova and Loyola. The Little Blues showed
surprising defensive strength in holding Maryland to three foul shots during the second half and a total of 17 points
in their game. Observers give them a good chance to hold down the high-scoring Carolina Phantoms in their game at
Chapel Hill tomorrow.

Cats Meet State: Davidson Wildcats, with a none-too-impressive conference record, seek to improve their position. The Wildcats were defeated by
V.P.I. in the last quarter scoring spree. Out for the victorious kittens was the fine defensive work of McWilliams and
Currie, and the brilliant floor work of Bruce.
