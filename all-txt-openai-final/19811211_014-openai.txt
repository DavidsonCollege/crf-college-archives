### The Kenyan Connection

Davidson alumni run Kenyan school

In 1975, Crawford Crenshaw, a Davidson student, stepped out of school for a year and came to Kenya because he
was interested in Third World development. A Quaker group, the Friends World College, had contacts to help him find a
place.

The "Kenya Connection" is an informal arrangement of friends recruiting friends and interested people finding contacts. Ken Wood's office at
Davidson serves as an information center and contact point for these Kenyan volunteers.

The work done in Kenya has never been considered a formal program of Davidson College. The successes and failures have
come directly from the students involved—both the actual volunteers and those who participate in the talent shows, spoof musicals, fund
drives, and other projects which have supported the work there.

Bushiangala is one of the success stories. It is now a school of over 600 students and this past year
became a government-sponsored school, the goal of all young self-help schools in Kenya. In addition to the constant stream of
teachers, Davidson gifts have helped sponsor many Bushiangala students with scholarships as well as played a major part in the
construction of the library, dining hall, laboratory, several staff houses, and a dormitory. From Bushiangala, Davidson volunteer help spread throughout
Kakamega District and now has an impact in many communities of Western Province. People who work with volunteers here first
determine if you're an American and then ask if you are from that college.

Not all projects where Davidson people have worked have been successful. Sometimes the local community never really gets behind the
effort, or dislikes or misunderstands the volunteer. In other cases, people have come here with false ideas or inappropriate expectations,
or perhaps for the "wrong" reasons, and the actual conditions soon leave them dissatisfied and unwilling to stay. The third
world is a very different one from where we lived and grew up.

There are many reasons why people decide to come to Kenya—adventure, ambition, searching, idealism, growing. After the experience, no one
returns to the U.S. the same, as it is a powerful cultural, emotional, and personal challenge. For many, it is
difficult to pinpoint within themselves just what exactly brought them here, for it is not easy to be objective about
motivations when they are your own. In any case, the life and work of this place cannot be easily forgotten
or dismissed, whatever the future brings.

Students have returned from Kenya with many different reactions. Some become cynical about development aid and third world problems, others
become even more idealistic and decide to pursue their life's work in a related field. All find the adjustment back
to the U.S. much more disturbing and difficult than coming over to Kenya. The shock of how much America has
and the wasteful extravagance of accepted American lifestyles really hits hard. It is a glaringly apparent fact and a difficult
reality to accept about your own home customs and friends.

The educational program at Davidson strives to emphasize values highly—producing marketable, quality diplomas. The success of this effort is evident
in the large number of committed and concerned individual graduates who have gone on to distinguished careers of service. One
by-product of this effort is the numerous student-conceived and sponsored service programs which have sprung up to allow Davidson undergraduates
to test their values and live their ideals. STEP-tutors, the Y, EMTs, the Depot, and many others are examples close
to home. The "Kenya Connection" is part of that same student spirit touching another continent in another world. The purpose
of this weekly (if the mail permits) column is to make that connection a bit stronger and make all of
our (you at home and us here) work closer together. I hope what we write interests you.
