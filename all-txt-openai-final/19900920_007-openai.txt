The new transfers (and an old one, Jeff Fraley) at Davidson this year come from as far away as Maine and China.

### Transfers Give High Marks to Davidson
By JENNIFER SIECK

Davidson College gained over thirty new students in January of 1990 and this fall. These students are not first-year students, but transfers. They come to Davidson anytime after their first semester at another school. They are geographically diverse, coming from as far away as Maine and the People’s Republic of China and from as close by as Huntersville and Mooresville, North Carolina. They represent a variety of different kinds of students as well: international transfers, “traditional” transfers (American college students between the ages of 18 and 22), and adult transfers who are returning to college to earn their bachelor’s degree.

Transfers, while unique, do share many common interests with four-year Davidson students. Transfer students apply to Davidson for some of the same reasons that first-year students do. Academic challenge, a small school, and professors who give students personal attention are all reasons that transfers come to Davidson. Leigh Hamrick, who is a sophomore transfer student entering Davidson this fall from Berry College in Rome, Georgia, commented, “Davidson has a challenging program. It has a reputation that is not just an empty shell: it has the meat in it.”

Adult transfer student Tom Lorenzin, a resident of Mooresville, North Carolina who has studied at the University of Illinois and UNC-Charlotte, has found the academic life thus far “invigorating, to say the least.” He added: “I have not been in a boring class.”

Transfers agree that Davidson offers much more than just classroom education, however. ROTC, Habitat for Humanity, the Women’s Concerns Committee, Intervarsity, Artist Series, and Amnesty International are just a few of the programs in which transfers actively participate. Life also presents an opportunity to get involved in the campus life. Robert Vanderford, who transferred as a junior this fall from Catawba College in Salisbury, North Carolina, feels that people at Davidson are “warm and amiable” and “willing to include you.” Another transfer, Gail Ruff, who came to Davidson last spring from the University of Florida, said she was meeting people gradually since she transferred mid-year. However, she also said that “people aren’t receptive to new people.” Hamrick found Berry College’s student body to be more “laid-back” than Davidson’s “academically oriented” students.

Another difficulty for this fall’s transfer students is that most live off-campus because of the housing crunch. Living off-campus has advantages and drawbacks, according to Vanderford, Hamrick, and Ruff. Vanderford enjoys having quiet studying time and some seclusion.

### Patterson Court Welcomes Freshmen Today

Today, freshmen will finally be able to hit Patterson Court after four weeks of waiting patiently. Freshmen and upperclassmen alike are ready for the big weekend. But wait a second. Shouldn’t freshmen know a few facts about the court?

In 1960, Patterson Court was built to replace the old fraternity houses on Jackson Court. Dr. William S. Patterson, who was a Pika, is the man for whom the court is named. According to Dean of Students Will Terry, Patterson was a Presbyterian preacher from Davidson. Terry approximates that about 60 percent of men and 80 percent of women join a house on the court. There are a total of 12 houses on the court—three women’s eating houses, six fraternities, the Black Students Coalition (BSC), a house being used for students to live in, and one vacant house. Davidson also has one off-campus fraternity.

In 1971, Davidson began the policy of self-selection for freshmen and others wanting to join a fraternity or eating house. The policy’s purpose was to make the houses open to all who were interested in joining. While self-selection has been a great success with eating houses, many question its effectiveness with fraternities who give out bids to prospective members. Terry says that while in past years there have been students who have self-selected fraternities that have not given them bids, this is not a frequent occurrence.

In the last four weeks, freshmen have found a place for themselves at Davidson. Hopefully, they have adjusted to the academic life, and gotten settled into their new home. No longer will they look or listen woefully to the strains of music drifting up from the court. Yet Terry reminds them that they should not completely let loose this weekend. “It is very important for fraternities and eating houses—”"As well as freshmen—to conduct themselves very carefully, and to act in a responsible manner,” is Terry’s advice to all who will be on the court this weekend. The following gives some information and advice for freshmen about the Patterson Court. This information was provided by the presidents of the houses.

Lastly, we provide a social and cultural outlet for African-American students,” Lindsay Mills, President.

Joe Binns | Music Review: Blues Traveler Has "Jazzy" Sound

Blues Traveler
A&M Records

The man can blow! Blues Traveler’s John Popper is the man with a mouth harp. Trained at the New School of Music and the Jazz Conservatory, Popper’s harmonica dominates the Princeton, New Jersey band’s first album. Popper also plays twelve-string acoustic and sings. His voice is decent, made better by his possession of a couple of different styles which he can sing in. The only bad thing is that while he’s singing he ain’t blowing.

Chan Kinchla, an old friend of Cecily Craighill’s, is, I believe, the only band member who has not received formal jazz training. But the album is not jazz (jazzy maybe), and Kinchla is not hurting on the guitar. He is a completely selfless musician and almost too much so. He rarely cuts loose on the album and I can’t say that I’m sure he could. Bobby Sheehan is the bass-toting member of the rhythm section and Brendan Hill, from London, wields the sticks. They lay down a formidable current of backbeat over which Popper’s mouthpiece skips, diving down, swimming in the groove every so often then resurfacing and flittering effortlessly.
