Take two years off this summer.

With the Army ROTC Two-Year Program.

Army ROTC usually takes four years of college. But you can do it in two.

If, for example, you couldn’t take Army ROTC during your first two years of college.

Or if you just didn’t want to take Army ROTC before. But now you recognize the benefits.

You start the Two-Year Program by going to our six-week Basic Camp the summer following your sophomore year.

Camp—a little classroom work; some challenging physical training—replaces the Basic Course you would have taken during your first two years of college. You’re well-paid for this six-week catch-up.

Then, after camp, you complete your Advanced Course during your junior and senior years.

Maybe you'll decide that the chance to get real management experience earlier than most people will be worth a lot later on.

Maybe you can use the $100 per month subsistence allowance you will get for up to 10 months of each school year.

Maybe qualifying for two careers simultaneously—military or civilian—is insurance against job uncertainties.

Or, maybe the opportunity for an Army ROTC scholarship is exciting.

The Army ROTC Two-Year Program is another chance for a better career, through Army ROTC.

Talk over the Two-Year Program with the Professor of Military Science at your school. Or use this coupon. There’s no obligation.

Army ROTC. The more you look at it, the better it looks.
