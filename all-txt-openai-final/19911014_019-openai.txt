The Athletics Council exists to provide a liaison between the Athletic Department and the student body. Last year, there was some controversy over the basketball ticket policy, and the Athletics Council would like to mediate between the students and the administration to provide a policy that is satisfactory to all involved.

The proposed basketball ticket policy for this year is as follows: the first two rows of seats could be picked up, as in the past, at the ticket window the day before the game, to allow diehard fans the opportunity for an early shot at the best seats. The rest of the seats would be claimed on a General Admission basis, first come-first served on the night of the game. Only an ID would be required for students to get into the game.

Express your reaction to the proposed policy by contacting a member of the Athletics Council.
