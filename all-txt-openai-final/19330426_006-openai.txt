Davidson Baseball Team Defends Big Five Lead

Batting Averages

Davidson has a big chance in scoring high in the individual averages of the Big Five teams. Mackorell leads the Wildcat aggregation with a batting average of .382. Davidson has an especially good hitting team this year, and will run the boys in the Big Five a close race if not outrun them. Morris and Mills have led the field in runs considering the number of hits they have. These two have 10 runs out of 11 hits and 9 runs out of 10 hits, respectively. The remaining three, Morgan, Morrison, J. G., and Peabody, are also to be commended for their excellent hitting.

Miller Cochran Sets New Wildcat Record

Miller Cochran, member of the Junior class of Davidson College, set a new record for the varsity shotput, when he hurled the iron ball 44 feet, 3 inches in the recent Davidson-Wake Forest track meet.

The Davidson athletic teams will have a busy week during the approaching seven-day period. The baseball, track, tennis, and golf teams are all campaigning on foreign soil. Monday, the linksmen took on Washington and Lee University at Lexington, Va. Earlier this year the ’Cats, led by the scintillating play of Jack Wagner, defeated the Generals, 11 to 7, in a match played over the Charlotte Country Club course.

On this same day the Davidson tennis team is at Lexington. On this tour the team has met with defeat at the hands of Carolina and Navy; and has placed second in the state championship held at Durham.

Tuesday finds the Davidson diamond aggregation, Big Five leaders, swinging into action against the Tar Heels of the University of North Carolina, who they have already handed two 4 to 3 lickings. The Carolina boys will be out for blood, and the game will have a bearing on the state race. Southpaw Pearce will probably face the Chapel Hill lads. The tennis team is at William and Mary on this day. Davidson has not met the Indians before, and they have a team highly spoken of.

Continuing their Virginia tour, the Davidson golfers will encounter the University of Richmond over the sporty James River course, Richmond, Va. The Spiders are the team that handed the ’Cats such a thorough lacing in the first match of the season.

On Wednesday, Coach Flake Laird will probably send George Baily to tame the claws of the Wolfpack of N. C. State at Raleigh. State has played two Big Five contests and lost to Wake Forest by a count of 12 to 1, and Duke, 5 to 0.

Thursday, Davidson’s representatives are idle, but on Friday the golf team whips into action at the Valley Brook course of the Sedgefield Country Club in Greensboro, against Duke University’s state champion Blue Devils.

Davidson’s track team treks southward on Saturday to have a meet in Columbia with the representatives of the University of South Carolina. Davidson’s track team risks a perfect record in this meet. Captain Fleagle is yet to meet defeat this season in either of his specialties, the century and the furlong. The ’Cats are especially strong in the weight events. An undefeated freshman track squad will also take into the Palmetto State, where they will encounter Presbyterian College freshmen in a meet at Clinton, S. C. The Blue Stockings have a strong aggregation, and the P. C. lads are expected to furnish plenty of opposition for the local yearlings.

War is the industrialist’s tantrum. He begins by gnashing his teeth, and then loses the worker’s head completely.—Bennet Craig.

The teacher is justified by his scholars.—

This is Cochran’s second year on the varsity cinder outfit, and he represents the college in the three weight events, the shotput, and the discus and javelin throws. In the meet with Wake Forest he threw the discus over 130 feet, but stepped out of the ring, thereby disqualifying the throw. This would have broken the college record in the discus throw.

Cochran is the son of Captain F. M. Cochran, professor of Military Science and Tactics at Davidson, and is a member of Theta Upsilon Omega social fraternity. He served on the committee in charge of Junior Speak.

Kittens Beat Belmont Abbey 2-0 in Good Game

The freshmen chalked up a neat win in defeating Belmont Abbey 2 to 0 Tuesday, April 11, at Belmont. This victory snapped a losing streak.of three games for the 'Kittens. The game was close from the outset, but the Davidson team showed superiority in every department and clearly won the contest. Jenkins, on the mound for the frosh, pitched masterful ball throughout, allowing only two hits. However, he was aided by some snappy fielding by his mates. Ab Cumbie turned in the fielding gem of the day late in the game with none out and a man on first. He came in fast to take a short fly back of second and then made a perfect throw to Burns at first to wipe out another man. All of the team was playing heads-up ball and deserved their victory. In striking out 12 more men in this game, Jenkins brought his total up to 28 for the season. There was no outstanding hitter for the Wildkittens, due to the effectiveness of the Abbey hurler. Nevertheless, in this win the freshmen showed a complete reversal of form, and, if they continue this pace, they are destined to go places in their diamond work.

Hines and Wright Down Davidson’s Net Champs In Doubles Tournament
Davidson Wins Second Place in the Tournament of Six North Carolina Teams

HINES TOURNEY FAVORITE
Damp Weather Mars the Playing of the Final Matches

Wilmer Hines, Carolina star and former national junior champion, defeated Jimmy Halverstadt, Davidson, to capture the intercollegiate tennis championship of North Carolina. The Tar Heel defeated the Wildcat star in straight sets, 6-2, 6-2, 6-3. Hines was the tournament favorite, and Halverstadt the dark horse entry. Halverstadt advanced to the final bracket by decisive victories over higher seeded foes. Damp weather marred the playing of the finals.
