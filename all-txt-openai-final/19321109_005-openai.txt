THE DAVIDSONIAN, NOVEMBER 9, 1932

Introduced by Dr. Walter L. Lingle, he delivered a very powerful talk to the members of this circle. Being one
of the six founders of Omicron Delta Kappa at Washington and Lee University, he related many of the hopes and
plans these men had at that time and then followed the subsequent development of the fraternity to all the major
universities and colleges in the South. After this short introduction, he continued by relating the leading incidents in the lives
of some of the world’s greatest leaders, including Robert E. Lee and others. He indicated the responsibility which members of
Omicron Delta Kappa must realize and assume if they are really worthy of being chosen into membership. He said that
Omicron Delta Kappa was originally founded for the sole purpose of bringing together leaders in the different walks of life
to perform some service on the campus. According to Mr. Glasgow, if any circle does not live up to these
ideals originally set down by the founders, its existence is not warranted.

A graduate of Davidson and of Union studying abroad writes:
"There are able scholars here whose books are read all over the religious world. None of them can surpass our
professors at Union as teachers, and none of them can challenge a student to joyous, practical Christianity as did our
professors there."

You know how it is. If a cigarette is mild—that is, not harsh or bitter, but smokes cool and smooth—then
you like it and don’t worry about how many or how often you smoke. And if it tastes right—that is,
not oversweet, not flat—then you enjoy it all the more. The right kind of ripe, sweet Domestic and Turkish tobacco...the
right aging and blending...make Chesterfields milder, better-tasting...They Satisfy!
