Trivers Easter Clothes Mirror
The Newest and
Smartest Styles

After months of preparation and effort of our large
organization, we are ready for your inspection with a
wonderful Easter showing of New York, Fifth Avenue
styled suits and top coats Direct-From-Maker-To-Wearer.

Not only is the Trivers display complete with the choicest and
smartest styles and models for young men, but it also shows a splendid
assortment of dignified garments for the older men.

Trivers woolens are newly arrived 1919 fabrics—neat and
beautiful in pattern and desirable in shade, comparing favorably with
the best merchant tailoring stocks.

Trivers prices today, as always, are based on a small-margin-of-
profit policy. Because our clothes are manufactured in our own day-
light UNION factory by master mechanics and on account of our
wholesale trade and tremendous volume of business in our 19 branch
stores, we are in a position to sell Trivers Clothes retail at practically
wholesale prices.

Let your Easter suit be a Trivers and remember:
“Whatever Price You Pay—You Save $10”.
