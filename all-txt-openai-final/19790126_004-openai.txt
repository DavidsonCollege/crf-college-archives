### THE DAVIDSONIAN

#### Two More Years

When Dr. Jonathan Boulton was hired to teach medieval history at Davidson four years ago, he was told to make his courses tough and not to worry about student enrollment. When Academic Vice-President Price Zimmermann called Dr. Boulton into his office recently to explain why Boulton’s contract wasn’t being renewed, he was told he wasn’t able to attract enough students to his classes to make it worthwhile for the college to keep him on.

When Boulton was hired four years ago, he was told Dr. Alexander McGeachy would be retiring soon, and that the college wanted to replace him with two specialists, one a medievalist, the other an ancient historian. Boulton was to be the medievalist. When he was called into Zimmermann’s office recently, he was told that he is really too sophisticated and too specialized to teach here. He should instead be teaching at Harvard or Yale, Zimmermann told him.

If Zimmermann actually did cite these reasons, and there’s no way to confirm Boulton’s story since Zimmermann still refuses to even admit that he’s denied Boulton a new contract, then Zimmermann should carefully reconsider his position.

In the first place, Boulton has spent about half his time teaching Humanities and history survey courses which usually attract about a dozen students and have never attracted fewer than six. For an area of knowledge so far removed from the interest and experience of most Davidson students as medieval history, this isn’t such a bad track record. It is very much in line with the enrollment figures of the other esoteric courses taught here.

Also, it is quite inappropriate to argue that Boulton is a “bad” teacher, because those students with a strong interest in medieval history who have taken his courses have said they were impressed with him as a teacher. If math teachers were judged by students who despised math, or if biology teachers were judged by students who despised biology, there would not be a single tenured math or biology professor on the faculty.

To fault Boulton because of the esoteric nature of his field is foolish, intemperate, and unwise. To fault him for his erudition, to say, in effect, that he is too smart to teach at Davidson—he is the only person on the faculty with two doctorates (one from Oxford University in England and the other from the University of Pennsylvania) and is presently working on six books—is to say that Davidson is not really such a good college at all.

To fault him for his personality (some students have said he is too formal, too aloof, and much too arrogant) or his personal habits (there are those students who say they are driven to abstraction by his habit of wearing Oxford robes during lectures and discussions) is to say that Davidson students are narrow-minded and incapable of being considerate to foreigners. Because D’Arcy Jonathan Dacre Boulton is a foreigner: he is a Canadian who grew up in a formal environment. Boulton does not wear his robes out of arrogance, but because he says he feels very uncomfortable without them. He does not invite students over for hot tea out of any Victorian affectation, but because that apparently seems to him to be a rural and pleasant ceremony.

And beyond all this, it should be remembered that Boulton was not up for tenure. He was up for contract renewal. Had Zimmermann been seriously displeased with Boulton’s performance as a teacher (Zimmermann never even sat in on one of Boulton’s courses, despite being invited), then surely he at least owed it to Boulton as a human being to tell him so and give him a chance to improve his performance.

Zimmermann could quite easily have handed Boulton a “Renewal with reservations,” and then have told him that if he didn’t improve he’d never get tenure. That Zimmermann did not even bother to do this is a tragedy.the Editor:

I saw the cartoon in a recent issue of The Davidsonian portraying Jimmy Carter propping up the Shah of Iran with boards taken from a human rights billboard. It is, I believe, a cartoon with two edges to it: criticism of President Carter’s selective human rights policy and portrayal of the Shah as a U.S. puppet.

In my mind, there is no question of the uneven application of the President’s human rights policy, which he has used like a mace on the governments of Argentina, Chile, and a few other countries whose goodwill he feels he does not need, while remaining blind and deaf to the violations of human rights by countries which he has chosen to woo, among them Panama and China.

As for the other side of the cartoon, I believe it is an inaccurate portrayal. Far from being a U.S. puppet, the Shah has exercised a vigorously independent policy and pursued courses that at times were quite opposed to what we perceived as U.S. interests. The Shah has been badly understood in the United States. We have seen demonstrations by thousands of Iranian students denouncing what they called the repression of the Shah’s regime, and probably thousands of Americans have come to believe the claims of the students. They are probably matched by thousands who see the current strife in Iran as a classic example of an oppressed people seeking their freedom from a reactionary tyrant. I hope you do not include yourself in that group, for they are badly mistaken.

The key issue in the current Iranian situation is the effort of hundreds of reactionary religious leaders who oppose the Shah’s reforms and seek to drag the country back into the seventh century. And to get their way, they do not care how many lives may be lost. The principal leader, Khomeini, living in exile in Paris, has demanded “rivers of blood” to flow against the Shah in order to overthrow him. And what are these religious leaders opposed to? The Shah’s land reform program has benefited more than 2 million peasants who have received land from former church and royal land holdings. Literacy has climbed from five percent to 52 percent in a quarter century under the Shah. In the same period, the number of universities has increased from 5 to 21. The Shah has given women the right to vote and to attend the universities. He has developed a network of 4500 hospitals and clinics throughout the country to promote health care.

It is true that the Shah’s rule has been flawed by repression and corruption. But even these abuses were being modified before the present unrest began. The Shah had given amnesty for Iranian students who had participated in anti-Shah demonstrations abroad; he had released 1000 political prisoners; he had set a date for the end of martial law and for the release of all political prisoners; and he had dismissed and arrested officials with human rights violations. The Shah is no saint, but as Middle Eastern monarchs go, he is one of the more progressive. Certainly, he is more progressive than those who would destroy him and throw the entire region into chaos while dragging the Iranian people back into the Dark Ages.
