T SUMMER ~ AH, LAST SUMMER!

The 1956 session of SUMMER SCHOOL at
Davidson offered many varied opportunities
for recreation on campus, as many of you
â€œold timers" may well remember. Seems
like there was something to do every day
to make life more interesting.

Is it all coming back to you?

Last summer, our campus was graced
with the now-infamous International Re-
lations Seminar. Davidson College put
on the cloak of Peace and Friendship
while the town's disgruntled citizenry
had logical (?) reasons for burning
crosses, for throwing water in the
vicinity of Duke Dormitory, and for
firing across the muddy Catawba with a
shotgun at the colorful members of the
Seminar.

This summer, no Seminar.

Last summer, dear old Georgia Dorm
was being dismantled and carted away. We
could watch with awe as the powerful
crane swung an iron fist against defense-
less walls. Yes, and after supper, that
was our time to play the game of destruct-
ion. Remember how that west wall buckled?

This summer, no Georgia.

And last summer, the food at the
cafeteria was always a subject for wry
(a very conservative word) comment. But
now that Mr. Little is in charge, we
can't even complain about the food.

By the way, fellas. Enjoy the
river while you can. They're going to
build a dam right above the river bridge
before long. When the construction
work begins, swimming will be out of
the question.

Last summer --- ah, last summer!
How quickly it passed.

So what to do this summer?

Guess there's nothing left to do
but to study.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR:

It has been noticed that a Phi Delt
has been trespassing upon the rights clearly
posted by a KA pin. Unite, KA's, and
drive this foreign dog from the heels of
this charming Southern belle!

-- An Observant Student

QUESTION OF THE WEEK:
What is your opinion of
the mythological "Davidson
gentleman"?

Jean Holder: Hmmmn?

Lacy Woods: Uh oh, you'd better
not ask me to give my opinion!

Mary Jo Whittle: There's only one,
and he's in West Virginia...

Eleanor Adams: I am very much
impressed with the Davidson
gentlemen. They're quite prevalent.

Linda Wilder: Only married students are
"Davidson gentlemen."

OFFENSIVE BIDDING

Bidding is perhaps the most diffi-
cult aspect of playing a good hand
of bridge. It is essential, at
times, to bluff your opponents by wild
bidding, but it is extremely distasteful
to be left at a bid of four diamonds,
when you have only six points in your
hand, and your partner has passed three
times. (You should have bid five dia-
monds instead, as it is always wise to
try for game.)

One rule to remember is to never
let your opponents take the contract,
if you and your partner have anything
at all. It is much less embarrassing
to bid five and go down four than to
be relegated to the inferior position
of a defensive player. Was it not our
great John C. Calhoun, who, while lect-
uring on bridge to the U.S. Senate,
said: "The surrender of life itself is
nothing to the acknowledgement of in-
feriority."

The words used while bidding are
very important. For example, "A spade"
means something entirely different
from "One spade." Furthermore, whether
you shout the bid or whisper it should
have a very definite meaning to your
partner. These signals must, of course,
be agreed upon in advance by partners,
and both must understand them fully.
