OLAS Makes Waves

Fun, friends, and dancing — just another night out on Patterson Court? No, last Thursday night students participated in the first campus event held this year by OLAS (The Organization of Latin American Students). The night got many people from all around campus and the Davidson community to dance to Latin American music.

Taken from the mission statement, the purpose of OLAS is to establish and maintain a spirit of solidarity among Latin American, Hispanic American, and Spanish students at Davidson College. The organization strives to create a sense of awareness of Latino and Spanish culture within the community of Davidson. By sponsoring events such as the Latin Dance Workshop, OLAS is working to make waves (olas in Spanish) and to achieve its goals.

This year at Davidson, the Latin American community is bigger than ever. In the Class of 2002 alone, eighteen students are Spanish, Hispanic, or Latin American. President Mauricio Sauma said, “OLAS is here to bring the flavor of Latin American culture to Davidson College.”

OLAS not only plans to spice up college life, but the group also wants to have a strong impact on the community. Community Service Chairman Brent Wilson said, “Our primary goal is to build bridges, connecting the Davidson College community with the surrounding Hispanic community. The interaction between the two cultures creates an atmosphere that allows for open communication and a mutual understanding of the cultural differences.”

OLAS has many future events planned such as the Cafe Tango study break, which will be held in the Morrison Room of the Union from 9:00 to 11:30 p.m. on Wednesday, September 16. Also, every Monday in Vail Commons, there is a Spanish table where students can test their Spanish-speaking ability. Everyone is invited to take a study break at either of these events.

OLAS meetings will be held every other Monday in the Conference Room of the Union starting September 14. Anybody can join, and membership is free. Also, there is no obligation to remain in OLAS.

The members of OLAS want to help the non-Hispanic students understand the Latin American culture and the Hispanic students fit into a new environment. Sauma said, “We (OLAS) are here for all of you.”

RENEW DRIVE ARE HERE AGAIN
SERVICE MONEY AVAILABLE

The Sunshine Lady Foundation hopes to brighten the lives of six deserving Davidson students by providing them with funds to donate toward their respective service interests. Sunbeams are provided with $10,000 each to spend on a cause. Specific guidelines for divvying the funds are provided after grants are awarded, as the Sunshine Lady Foundation awards grants to individuals rather than causes.

Students interested in becoming a Sunbeam must complete a proposal explaining why they should fill one of the slots. Students should provide compelling reasons why they would be the “perfect” person to spend this money. The Sunbeams who are selected will receive a packet of information from the Sunshine Lady Foundation and will have one year to spend the money.

Grants on Davidson’s campus are available to a sophomore, junior, and senior Bonner Scholar, and a sophomore, junior, and senior service student. Interested students may contact Ruth Pittard at 2133 for information.
