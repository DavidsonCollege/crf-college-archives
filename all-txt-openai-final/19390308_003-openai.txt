Question of the Week

Recently there has been quite some discussion on the campus on the subject of elections for the coming year. One
remedy proposed is to have the qualifications of a candidate presented before the student body. Many think the best way
to present the qualifications of a candidate is through the president of the student body. However, the president is often
burdened with other duties, and it would be up to him to present this to the student body himself or
have the man who is acquainted with the candidates do it for him. In case this is not feasible, the
vice-presidents of the student body could take over.

Victor Hollis, Junior: The election of candidates at Davidson, I think, is usually done in ignorance of the possible candidate’s
abilities. Very few of the student body know all of the candidates well enough to cast what you might call
a wise vote. My tentative solution to this problem is to have some close friend of each candidate make a
very short and concise presentation of his qualifications. In my opinion, this would help greatly to remedy the present situation,
and also would aid in the student government of tomorrow.

Bob Lewis, Sophomore: In my opinion, there is quite a bit of ignorance on the part of the student body
regarding the qualifications of each candidate. I think it would help to elect the best-fitted man for office, and would
in many cases eliminate the man who would not successfully fill the office. I can see only one possible way
to bring a true, unbiased presentation before the student body. This is to let the president of the student body
appoint a committee to privately investigate the qualifications of each candidate and present their findings to the student body.

36 Alumnus Honored At Mississippi

William Coleman Branton, Davidson graduate of the class of 1936, has recently received the unusual honor of a place in
the Hall of Fame at the University of Mississippi. He is the second to attain that honor this year. The
Hall of Fame is prepared annually by the Mississippian, the university's weekly newspaper. Branton's election is especially noteworthy because he
was elected on the basis of excellent scholarship and extra-curricular activities. He was an honor roll student, president of Omicron
Delta Kappa, a member of Blue Key service fraternity, and a member of the Collegiate. He is now the present
head of the department of the R.O.T.C. unit and senior football manager. His social fraternity was Phi Gamma Delta.

Phi Beta Kappa Initiates

On last Tuesday morning, Feb. 28, Dr. Price H. Gwynn extended bids to five men of the present senior class
on behalf of the Davidson chapter of Phi Beta Kappa. These men have all attained a scholastic average of 93
or over, and their initiation brings the total membership of Gamma chapter to sixteen men. All of these men have
shown themselves very outstanding in scholarship. Those extended the bids are: top row, left to right: Reid Patterson of Charlotte
and Thomas Mullen of Roanoke Rapids; bottom row, left to right: Eugene Liipfert of Winston-Salem, R. Archer Torrey of North
China, and Fred R. Stair of Knoxville, Tenn.

Dr. Lingle To Speak

Dr. Walter L. Lingle, president of Davidson College, will be the speaker at the First Presbyterian Church in Kingston, N.Y.,
next Sunday, March 12. He will talk at the dedication of the new religious education building of the First Presbyterian
Church in Kingston, of which Rev. Harold McAfee Robinson is pastor. On the following Sunday, March 17, Dr. Lingle will
be in Richmond to speak at a meeting of the State Education Association on the place of the liberal arts
college in modern education.
