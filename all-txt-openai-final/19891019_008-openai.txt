Volleyball has mixed week—Plauche continues stellar play

After a tough loss to Radford two weeks ago, the Wildcat volleyball team bounced back to take the first game of a double-header against Mars Hill and Wofford. The team then split with Catawba and Augusta later in the week.

Sophomore Mimi Plauche and freshman Jennie Wagner led the team in a tough battle with Radford University.

The Cats fell 16-4, 4-15, 14-16, 15-8, 11-15. Plauche had an amazing 21 kills, with a .400 average. Wagner also had a great game, slamming nine kills and recording 17 digs.

In the double header last Tuesday, Davidson stopped Mars Hill 15-10, 15-7, but were defeated by Wofford 12-15, 0-15 in the second match.

Coach Rebecca Hawkins said, “The team played well considering the girls just learned a new defense and had time off for fall break.”

“Although we played a little sluggish, we should be back on track this week,” she added.

Last Thursday the ‘Cats lost to Catawba 8-15, 8-15, 10-15. On Friday they finally got back on track to waste Augusta 15-7, 15-7, 15-8.

The Cats played Campbell University at home in a late game yesterday.

Cross Country has good showing at Furman

Last weekend, the Davidson cross-country team finished 13th and 15th in the men’s and women’s divisions at the Furman Invitational in Greenville, SC.

Kathy Beach led the women by finishing 64th out of 137 runners. Freshman Heather Tarpley finished second for the Wildcats with a 66th place finish.

Chris Otrok led the way for the men with an 83rd place finish out of 160 runners. Ian Stewart, David Kerns, Ted Richardson, and Peter Hurtado also ran well.

For Parent’s Weekend the team will host the Davidson Invitational.

Men’s tennis goes 2-1; will cohost Furman with women

Last week the Davidson men’s tennis team defeated UNCC (8-7) and Wofford College (9-0). Earlier in the week the team was defeated by Virginia Tech in a close 5-4 struggle.

For Parent’s Weekend the team will dedicate the Covington Hardcourts with a dual match with the women’s team against Furman University.

Coach Jeff Frank stated, “This is the first time such an event will have occurred at Davidson.” The match will include singles, doubles, and mixed doubles competition.
