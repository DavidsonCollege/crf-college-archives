**Laundry: worth the price?**

“The cost of education is rising. I can do my own laundry. Why do I have to pay more and
more to get my clothes cleaned?” That’s what more and more Davidson students are asking themselves as laundry fees go
up and up — by more than a hundred dollars in the past four years.

Does Davidson really need a laundry? It’s a tough question. Some simple mathematical calculations would seem to prove that the
Davidson laundry is extraordinarily expensive. Suppose that a load of laundry costs $1.50 to wash at a typical coin-operated laundromat,
and that the typical Davidson student would wash four loads of clothes a week. Throw in perhaps twenty dollars for
detergent. That adds up to $200 a year, a lot less than the $310 students are required to pay to
Davidson.

Davidson’s laundry just can’t seem to get into the black. It lost over a hundred thousand dollars in 1984. It’s
projected that it will break even this year, but that’s not surprising; when a business can raise its prices without
fear of losing customers, profits can be summoned at the stroke of a pen. (The proper economic term for such
a business is “monopoly.”) And as if the economics of it all weren’t bad enough, there’s also the matter of
the quality of the laundry’s work: many students complain that their clothes are damaged at the Davidson laundry. There’s no
way to tell how extensive such damage might really be, but even the smallest problems reflect rather badly upon the
college. Instead of having to blame themselves for their poorly-handled clothes, the students blame Davidson.

So why do we have a laundry? Why don’t we just shut it down and fill the building with coin-operated
washers and dryers? Students would save money, so they’d be happy. Coin-operated laundries usually make money, so the college would
be happy. What’s the big deal?

The era when there was an absolute necessity for the college laundry is long since past. Davidson is no longer
as isolated as it once was, and the student body could now conceivably support a coin-operated laundromat. Perhaps the most
important reason why Davidson College still has a laundry, then, is because it employs so many people. Die-hard free-marketeers might
be inclined to advocate firing the staff and installing machines in the name of efficiency, but in a community like
Davidson which bases itself upon trust and fellowship such an action would amount to little more than heartless greed. The
people at the laundry depend upon it for their livelihoods; they’re also much more caring and sensitive than coin-operated washing
machines. A machine can’t sew on a button or dry-clean the expensive wool slacks that you foolishly included in the
bag with your socks. Students pay a price to support a labor-intensive laundry, but the laundry is a much warmer
place because of it.

But sooner or later the college will have to face the fact that the laundry is economically unfeasible. Students can’t
be expected to perpetually subsidize a money-losing business just because it would be morally painful to dismantle it. Wouldn’t it
be best, then, to try to phase out the laundry over a long period of time so as to protect
the people who have devoted their lives to it? Workers could be assigned to other branches of the college until
they eventually decided to stop working. They wouldn’t be hurt, and the college wouldn’t be forced to bear the economic
burden of supporting a money-losing enterprise. Eventually the mandatory laundry fee could be eliminated and coin-operated machines installed. It would
be a difficult solution to orchestrate, but in the end, it might be the best one.while it charges so much

BOARD PLAN — Controversy over the college’s new board plan sparked debate during Davidson’s first week of classes. Under the
new plan, $2.51 is allotted per day for a student’s meals, but students claim that figure is not enough, resulting
in students not eating nutritious meals. Approximately $600 was paid in board fees by the students. Food Services Director Ron
Scott claims that by the end of the term, students should have money left over because of weekends spent away
from Davidson and invitations for meals at fraternity houses. Students can pick from two different houses and atmospheres for meals:
Richards House, a snack bar serving full meals or short orders, and Rusk House, a “buffeteria” which serves sandwiches at
lunch but for dinner becomes a steak house.

BLACKS PROTEST — Black students at Davidson have protested to Dean of Students Will Terry over their harassment by campus
police officers. In eleven days, three Davidson students who were black were detained by policemen, asked to provide I.D.s, and
questioned about their business on campus. For one black student, the student I.D. was not enough, and he was asked
to produce a “special piece of paper” which stated that he was actually a student.

ELECTION ‘72 — Students who voted in the straw poll voted 320 for Nixon, 245 for McGovern, and 11 for
Schmitz. Faculty votes were McGovern, 45, and Nixon, 13. President Samuel Spencer urged students, the majority of whom could vote
for the first time in a national election, to vote and to make arrangements for absentee ballots if necessary.

NEW HOUSE: BSC — The Black Student Coalition, which has been at Davidson since the early seventies, moved from Jackson
to Patterson Court to be more in the mainstream of campus social life. President Anne Elliot expects fifty black students
to join the house, which she sees as, “a backbone of strength for blacks . . . [which] will expose
whites to the culture and sensitivities of blacks that the majority of Davidson students would never experience or face.” According
to house secretary Judy Harrell, the BSC, which is open to all students at all times, is at Davidson “to
encourage interrelationships among blacks and whites.”

SOCCER WINS — Memorial Stadium was the scene of an incredible tie-breaker as Coach Slagle’s soccer team, aided by the
phenomenal goalkeeping efforts of junior Pat Woodward and the team’s remarkable defense, eliminated Winthrop College in the final game of
the Charlotte Observer tournament. The final confrontation ended in a “shootout” which decided the tied game after 110 minutes of
scoreless battle; final count: 2-1.
