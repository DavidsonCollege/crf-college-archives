and to eliminate those that no longer give benefits. Also, the Committee strongly urged that some kind of cost accounting be initiated and closely tied in with long-range planning.

Williams emphasized the importance of economic considerations. He said that these considerations have a vital affect on such things as expanding programs, the size of enrollments, adequacy of physical facilities, personnel, and the character of the community.

The Committee specifically highlighted the need for more endowments for faculty salaries and for faculty and academic program development. They emphasized the need for endowment and capital funds for special academic replacement of Physical Plant items.

Williams believes that the Committee confirmed the prominent needs that have been expressed by the community and campus. He added that it is vitally important for the College to have determined what its primary objectives are in order to secure donors.

"We (the Committee) created an environment on campus which will be conducive to total institutional long-range planning. At the heart of that kind of planning are program needs,” he concluded.

Williams said, “It is equally important to the College that the difficulties the Goals Committee confronted were a result of a lack of direction in long-range planning... In behalf of that committee as individuals and as a group, we received a great deal of criticism from a great many people. Most criticisms were accurately assigned. I think the Committee itself was aware of the accusations it had received,” Williams added that he expects several years to pass before the value of the Goals Committee is realized.

The Committee said that the need for funds to improve student housing and food services was pressing. They hinted that the existing system of small eating clubs may have to give way to a central eating facility.

Because student life depends to a degree on the “focus which the arrangement of campus facilities gives to college activities,” the College must consider the location of new structures on campus and budget in light of this. They also suggested improvements in the fraternity house units to provide more seating room, a chemistry facility, an art facility, and a field house and additional physical education facilities. They called on plans for more endowments for student scholarships, to make sure the College does not “risk pricing itself out of the market for good students, especially those with limited financial backgrounds.”

Lately, Bayer Aspirin’s advertising has featured a blue book that contains some of the findings of a recent American Medical Association drug evaluation.

Bayer’s blue book reports there is “no sound basis” for taking combination pain relievers or buffered preparations instead of plain aspirin.

The obvious implication here is that remedies like Cope (a combination of aspirin, caffeine, a buffer, and antihistamine) and Vanquish (a combination of pain relievers) don't make sense.

The value of the Goals Committee’s work will not be realized until years in the future.
