**The Davidsonian, May 28, 1919**

**ALUMNI NOTES**

For two years the annual alumni address before the two literary societies has been dispensed with. But it was resumed again this spring; and the societies were peculiarly fortunate in having Dr. Walter Lingle, of Union Theological Seminary, to make this annual address on Monday night.

In beginning his “remarks,” as Dr. Lingle chose to style his address, he referred to the vast difference between the present-day lucid, non-frantic, expository form of speaking and the old bombastic, declamatory style, when the preacher began his gestures to the right hand and to the left before he proceeded into the announcement of his text. And Dr. Lingle said that the present-day oratory is superior to the old form. The old style had certain glaring defects which are omitted and more or less remedied in the new style.

In the first place, the old style was too pessimistic. And the speaker cited how he had most scathingly denounced socialism when in college, having read nothing of socialism except its perils. And if all the perils predicted in those Junior and Senior speaking had come to pass, the old world would be “nix” today. Again, the old style of oratory was too sad. A maiden dubbed it aright when she whispered out at the close of a very serious oration, “The services will be continued at the grave.” A third faultiness in the old oratory was its lack of reality. Subjects were chosen which seem absurd now in the lack of relation they bore to life. Dr. Lingle again cited a speech of his own on the future of Constantinople twenty-five years ago when such a subject as little concerned the American citizen as did the Sultan's harem. A fourth fault was that it was too artificial. In those days of the good old South, a speaker could orate long and eloquently when he had but little to say, and would always wax into his greatest eloquence when he had nothing at all to say and was not bound to a subject.

In bringing his remarks to a close, Dr. Lingle pointed out that it had been the result of his several years’ observation of excellent speakers that a good speaker is as a rule also a good listener. And he said, “A man who wants to speak well ought to become a good listener.” It is well, he pointed out, to observe all good speakers and try to find the secret of their success; all bad speakers to avoid their pitfalls. Emulate the successful qualities of a good speaker and cultivate the art of being a good listener.

After this address, the meeting was adjourned to the two literary society halls, respectively, where diplomas were awarded to those Seniors graduating from the societies, and where the alumni of each society were given a chance to redeem the failures of former years and to recount those happy days of long ago.

Hundreds of friends and alumni will be interested in the news of the marriage of Miss Thelma Lamson Russell, of Marlboro, Mass., and Dr. Douglas Heath Nisbet, L. S. Medical Corps, the marriage being solemnized Wednesday night, May 7th, at the home of the bride's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Clifton B. Russell, at Marlboro. Only relatives and intimate friends witnessed the marriage. Miss Margaret Peach, Marlboro, was maid of honor, and Lieut. B. J. Berger acted as best man. Mrs. Mildred Heath Hargrave was the only representative of the groom’s family present. Dr. Nisbet and Miss Russell met in the Boston City Hospital, he being there as an intern, and she in training as a nurse for overseas service.

The bride is a member of one of the old families of New England, her family being among the most prominent in Marlboro, a delightful city of 40,000 or 50,000 people. She is pretty, charming, and talented, and was making rapid progress in the work which she had chosen during the war period. Dr. Nisbet is the oldest son of Dr. and Mrs. Walter Olin Nisbet, of Charlotte. Before coming to Davidson, he took his preparatory training at Charlotte University School. After graduating from Davidson, he entered Harvard in the medical school, from which he graduated shortly afterwards. He is now serving at the Base Hospital at Fort Sam Houston.

**ALUMNI PARAGRAPHS**

R. M. Miller, Jr.

The standing of a College is often judged by the character and make-up of its College paper or magazine. The “Davidsonian” is our College paper—it is an asset and not a liability and as such it deserves the fullest encouragement and support of the Alumni. Its subscription list should now carry at least one thousand names of our Alumni. The staff of the paper donates their time and labor without compensation. This shows a spirit of loyalty which should be appreciated by every alumnus of the College. In return for this loyalty to their Alma Mater, they charge the sum of $1.25 per annum for the “Davidsonian”—a mighty small pittance they ask us to contribute to their success. Subscribe to the “Davidsonian”—and do so now for 1919-1920. Help the boys. They deserve it and are entitled to it.

The friends of the College everywhere join in congratulating Dr. Martin upon his recovery, after a severe and critical illness.

Rev. A. M. Fraser, D.D., of Staunton, Va., is an alumnus of Davidson, class of 1876. He has just been elected Moderator of the General Assembly of the Southern Presbyterian church. This honor is the highest in the gift of the Assembly—it is most worthily bestowed and it will be most worthily worn.

It strikes me that a closer working relation or union between the Board of Trustees and the Faculty, with the Alumni Association, would make for the betterment of the College.

It strikes me that the very drastic restrictions against the social functions and festivities of the “boys” might be made less oppressive, if not entirely removed. The career of no young man has ever been ruined by association with a good woman, per contra, many a young life has been wrecked by the lack of it.

It is still hoped that the Alumni of Davidson will endow a Professorship. The time is hardly opportune now to inaugurate the movement, because many of us have been called upon, during the past two years, to contribute our limit to the various war emergency causes—but, later on, it can be undertaken and I believe carried to a successful conclusion.

**DR. B. R. LACY TO ATLANTA**

It is safe to say that there was no officer in the entire Allied Armies that was better loved or moreAdmired by the men, Captain B. R. Lacy, '06, was highly regarded. "Lacy is the most wonderful man I ever met," is the tribute paid to him by his commander, Capt. L. P. McLendon. Not content with ministering to the comfort of the fighting men behind the lines, tending the wounded under shell fire, burying the dead, and assisting in other phases affecting the spiritual and material well-being of his organization, the young chaplain figured in spectacular fashion in actual clashes with the Huns. The daring bravery shown by the young chaplain earned him the title of "The Fighting Parson," by which he is known throughout the A. E. F. Chaplain Lacy left the assistant pastorate of the First Presbyterian Church of Raleigh to enter a training school for chaplains. At Davidson and later at Union Seminary, his record was a brilliant one. He spent two years at Oxford University, England, by winning a Rhodes scholarship at Davidson. He has accepted the pastorate of the Central Presbyterian Church of Atlanta, Ga., the largest Presbyterian Church in that city.

Among the alumni of Davidson who have made a name for themselves in the world, there is one who has reached the position most coveted by soldiers, namely, holding the title of General. This one is Brig. Gen. George C. Barnhardt. Gen. Barnhardt is from Norwood, N. C., and entered Davidson in 1886, a member of the class of 1890. While at Davidson, he received an appointment to West Point, which he accepted. Mr. Barnhardt received his commission as Brigadier General on the first day of October, 1918.

TWO MORE HAVE REACHED STEPPING OFF PLACE.

Invitations have been received announcing the marriage of Mr. Thomas H. Strohecker to Miss Lucia Helen Smith, of New York, which is to take place at the home of the bride's parents on Riverside Drive, June 19th. Miss Smith is a graduate of Vassar, also of Columbia University, and is at present assistant professor of Chemistry in the University. She is a young woman of exceptional ability and has an admiring range of friends in the University circles as well as socially, in New York, and in Detroit also, where she formerly lived and where she and Mr. Strohecker met. Mr. Strohecker, after leaving Davidson, entered Roanoke College, from which he graduated. He then entered the National Law School in Washington City, where he took a post-graduate course. He enlisted in the Air Motor service when the country declared war. He is now in business in Detroit, and will make his home there after his marriage.

The Central Presbyterian Church learns with interest of the marriage of Miss E. E. White, daughter of Dr. and Mrs. White, of Raleigh, N. C., and Rev. B. R. Lacy, Jr., the new pastor of the church. Mr. and Mrs. Lacy will reach Atlanta the week preceding the third Tuesday in May. As an expression of love and good wishes on their wedding day, the officers of the Central church sent a beautiful silver service as a marriage gift—The Atlanta Journal.

Alumni will read with interest the above announcement, for "Ben" Lacy, "The Fighting Parson," is one of Davidson’s most beloved alumni, belonging to the class of 1906. He has recently returned from France, where his brave exploits as a chaplain earned him the title of "The Fighting Parson."
