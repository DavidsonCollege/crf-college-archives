| THE DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 13, 1932

Survey Reveals That 40.6 Per Cent of Classes Graduating Since 1925 Have Continued Studies After Leaving Here

Of the Total 736 Graduates, 102 Have Prepared Themselves for the Ministry and 197 Have Done Other Graduate Study

PEAK IN 1928

These 299 Men Have Enrolled at 52 Different Institutions Throughout America. Many to North

The alumni office has completed a survey of the last seven graduating classes at Davidson, to ascertain how many have attended graduate institutions, including seminaries, and the alumni secretary has prepared statistics that are revealing to the general public and flattering to the institution. Briefly and summarily, it is learned that of the 736 graduates of the last seven classes, 299 of them, or 40.6 per cent, have continued their studies after leaving Davidson. Of the total 299, almost one-third of them, 197 for a percentage of 26.7 to be exact, have entered institutions other than seminaries, and 102 of them, or 13.8 per cent, have prepared, or are preparing, themselves for the ministry. These men have attended 52 different institutions.

At the outset, it may be explained that this percentage might be even larger if each individual had been asked to fill out a blank indicating the data that has been prepared. It is based largely, however, on the knowledge of the last seven classes that has seeped into the office of the alumni secretary, and it is believed that a number of others have done part-time graduate work since leaving Davidson.

It is readily recognized from the chart which has been prepared and which is printed at the end of this article that there was a notable increase in interest in post-graduate study from 1925 through 1928. The peak was reached in the latter year, when 51.6 per cent of the ’28 graduates continued their preparation at other institutions. Since then, however, there has been a drop, and an explanation which seems plausible is the financial depression which swept the country in the fall of 1929 and curtailed it perceptibly. It is a well-known fact that studying in graduate universities entails an expenditure almost double that of Davidson.

On Decrease

Between 1928 and 1929, the decrease was 7.1 per cent, and the difference between 1928 and 1930 was 12.8 per cent. Figures listed for the class of 1931 should not be taken as final, for a number of the most recent graduates are now working and expect later to enter the professional institutions. This will hold true to a minor extent for the class of 1930, but the final percentage would not vary much from that which is given.

With the exception of the year 1928, when only eight per cent of the class decided to enter the ministry, there has not been much variance in the number of men or the percentage of the class going to the seminary. Eliminating the 1928 record, the percentage has varied but 5.9, the class of 1927 having the highest, 18.6 per cent of its number entering that work, to the low of the class of 1931 with 12.7. Again, there may be more 1931 men entering the ministry, but it will be noted that 1929 had 12.8, which does not change the original margin much.

It is doubtful if there will be any class which will soon equal the record of 1928 in the number of men who went to professional schools, other than the seminaries. The total was 43.2 per cent of the class, or 54 of the men. The low percentage is held by 1931 with 17.3, but there will be others later. The next percentage is that of the class of 1925 with 19 per cent of its members.

No attempt has been made to prepare statistics upon the various seminaries which the 102 men attended, except to state that they have gone to eight different institutions, as follows: Union Seminary, Richmond, Va.; Columbia Seminary, Decatur, Ga.; Louisville Seminary, Louisville, Ky.; Princeton Seminary, Princeton, N. J.; Westminster Seminary, Philadelphia, Pa.; San Francisco Seminary, San Anselmo, Calif.; Erskine Seminary, Due West, S. C., and the Baptist Seminary, Seminary Hill, Texas.

Where They Studied

On the other hand, it is interesting to study where the 197 graduate students have attended. The total is 44 different colleges or universities. It may be explained here that a number of the 197 men have attended more than one institution since they left Davidson, and with this in mind, the statistics offered will be more understandable.

The largest number of Davidson graduates in the last seven years have attended the University of North Carolina in its various departments. Almost one-fourth have gone to Carolina. There have been 48 Davidson graduates there for a 24.4 percentage. What is most interesting is that Harvard University claims the next largest number with 35, or a percentage of 17.7, while the next closest institution is the University of Virginia with 16, followed by Duke University with 15.

Looking at it from another angle, the graduate departments of Carolina, Duke, N. C. State, and Wake Forest have claimed 34 per cent, or 67 of the total 197 post-graduate students, while the five institutions of Harvard, Columbia University, University of Pennsylvania, Yale, and Princeton have together claimed 69 of them for a 35 per cent record. With these institutions obtaining 69 per cent, it is readily seen that the others are over a large number of institutions.

The following are institutions, and the number of Davidson men who have attended them in the past seven years: University of North Carolina, 48; Harvard, 35; University of Virginia, 16; Duke University, 15; Columbia University, 11; University of Pennsylvania, 11; Emory University, 10; Vanderbilt, Yale, Princeton, and Richmond Medical College, six each; Tulane and University of Edinburgh, five each; Cornell and University of Georgia, four each; University of Chicago, New York University, Johns Hopkins, and N. C. State, three each.

Institutions which two Davidson men attended have been Jefferson Medical College, University of Maryland, University of South Carolina, and the University of Arkansas. The others, at which one Davidson graduate was a student, are University of Texas, Temple University, University of Michigan, Colorado School of Mines, Purdue, George Washington University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Colorado, University of Mississippi, University of Alabama, Carnegie Tech, Charleston Medical College, University of Miami, University of West Virginia, Brown, University of Louisville, Wake Forest, University of Illinois, Oxford University, and University of Vienna.

The following chart will give data regarding the distribution of the men to the seminaries and graduate schools according to the classes:

Junior week-end will start off as Class Websters meet in the oratorical contest. Harllee Branch, Jr., and L. D. Wharton, Jr., won debates against William and Mary and Rutgers College. Eleven campus leaders have been recently tapped by Omicron Delta Kappa. The newly elected members include: G. R. Sims, R. L. Lincoln, J. C. Bernhardt, and V. S. Broyles, members of the Senior class; Hugh Arrowood, W. O. Nisbit, B. F. Martin, Charlie McRae, Caldwell Withers, Jr., W. L. Lingle, Jr., and W. R. Grey, Jr., of the Junior class. In the election of members of the Y. M. C. A. Board of Control, Prof. J. P. Williams was elected as faculty member; W. L. Lingle, Jr., as senior member, and R. E. Kell and Monroe Gilmore as junior members. The annual R. O. T. C. inspection was gratifying to the officials and the faculty members were pleased with the results. The Davidson varsity and freshman track teams placed a close fourth in Tech relays held in Atlanta on April 9. Kell, Goodykoontz, Currie, and Pinkney composed the varsity team. The freshman relay was composed of Whittle, McGavock, Peterson, and Brohard.

April 12, 1923

The student body of Davidson College on Saturday, April 7, voted unanimously to abolish all forms of hazing. This time-honored custom has been displaced after three months’ trial under the new regime of the Court of Control. A discussion was led by A. L. Currie, Y. M. C. A. secretary. Following his speech, J. I. Smith read the report of the court’s meeting. W. M. Cox, D. B. Walthall, R. H. Smith, and L. D. Elkins won the right, on Friday morning of Junior Speaking, to contest again at commencement. The following members of the Reporters’ Club have been awarded the Golden Quill, which is the highest honor in the gift of the club: W. P. Brown, H. B. Price, M. P. Calhoun, C. M. S. McIlwaine, W. H. Sharpe, D. B. Walthall, and W. F. Galloway. Junior Speaking goes on record as the most brilliant affair ever staged at Davidson. The gymnasium was converted into the “Black Cat Cabaret,” imported direct from little old New York. Junior Speaking this year was under the direction of W. T. Jones, W. Z. Bradford, R. R. Jones, and L. D. Elkins. In the recent elections A. M. Hillhouse was elected as president of the student body; W. T. Jones as president of the “Y,” and W. M. Heston as editor-in-chief of the annual.

April 18, 1917

R. H. Ratchford and J. A. Thames of Davidson lost their debate to the Roanoke debating team last Friday night. The query was “Resolved: That the United States should adopt a system of compulsory military service.” J. W. Clark, Rawls Howard, H. L. Mayfield, and B. D. Roddey will represent Davidson at the Southern Intercollegiate golf tournament to be held in Greensboro next Tuesday. Statement by President William J. Martin: “I take it that our entire college is at the command of our government to be used as needed. In the light of the action of Congress to be taken this week, we will make every possible and proper arrangement to prepare ourselves to respond at the right time to any call of our country. I expect to get home Wednesday, and we will then decide our definite course of action. In the meantime, I am getting all possible information to act promptly at the proper moment.” Among alumni visitors to the campus during the past week have been Dr. D. C. Mebane, ’78, of Evanston, Ill.; J. M. Ulmer, ’30, of New York, N. Y., and Chas. T. Parker, ’31, of High Point. Friends will regret to learn of the death of J. V. Knox, of near Davidson, father of A. C. Knox, ’17, R. B. Knox, ’20, and Frank J. Knox, ’32. Captain W. A. Dumas, ’15, for the past four years instructor in mathematics at the United States Military Academy at West Point, is now attending the Army War College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. In the recent announcement of fellowship awards by the University of North Carolina, the names of two Davidson men appear. W. M. Treverton, ’27, was given a fellowship in psychology, and James A. Alexander, ’29, was awarded a fellowship in geology. Both of these men have studied at the University of North Carolina the past year under similar fellowships. S. H. Hearn, ’71, member of the board of directors of Efird Manufacturing Company since its organization in 1896, has resigned from a directorship of the mill, but retained his position as treasurer of the company. W. O. Nisbet, Jr., ’28, of Charlotte, is one of the stockholders in the new firm, Interstate Securities Corporation, with the principal office in Charlotte. Rev. W. L. Baker, ’26, pastor of the Union Presbyterian Church near Lowell, is now at Vanderbilt University where he is taking a special ten-day course in the school of religion at that institution as a result of a scholarship award. Among Davidson alumni who were speakers at the joint session of Fayetteville, Wilmington, and Orange Presbyteries at Flora Macdonald College, Red Springs, today and yesterday, were Rev. W. M. Baker, ’09, retiring moderator of Orange Presbytery, who preached the opening sermon last night; Rev. A. R. McQueen, D.D., ’03, of Dunn, who addressed the gathering on Christian education, and Rev.
