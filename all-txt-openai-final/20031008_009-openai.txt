**Complaints and Comments**

"I think what we’ve had here is a little social concern in the NFL. The media has been very desirous that a black quarterback do well. There is a little hope invested in McNabb, and he got a lot of credit for the performance of this team that he didn’t deserve. The defense carried this team."

This statement, made on September 28 by Rush Limbaugh on ESPN’s Sunday NFL Countdown, has resulted in a wave of controversy and, on Wednesday, Limbaugh’s resignation from the show. Players, coaches, and fans have expressed their disappointment, while members of the media have bashed Limbaugh for his insensitivity. With all the attention and criticism that these remarks have drawn, some have begun to wonder whether things are being blown out of proportion. Are people overreacting? Absolutely not.

Limbaugh is right about one thing. There is social concern in the NFL, as well there should be. Racial inequality exists in the league as it does in every facet of American society, and it cannot and should not be ignored. The lack of black coaches in the NFL is perhaps the most well-documented of these problems. It is not the only one. For years the quarterback was seen as a “white” position, and black signal callers were constantly under intense scrutiny. Recently, with an influx of black players at the position, this misconception had seemingly faded away. As Titans QB Steve McNair is quoted as saying in an ESPN.com article about the race issue in the NFL, “Until this episode, I thought it was gone.” The league is making significant strides towards shifting the focus from skin color to ability.

Which is why people like Rush Limbaugh have no place in the NFL. His comments take a significant step backwards from the progress towards racial equality in the NFL. The assertion that McNabb is given undeserved acclaim based on the color of his skin discredits McNabb and all black quarterbacks and players. To suggest that a black person is given any type of benefit based on the color of his or her skin in a society where the exact opposite is often the case is nothing short of ludicrous. Not to mention that the statement about McNabb is completely unfounded. The Eagles have had a great defense since McNabb has been in place as the starter, but that does nothing to explain his 82.7 passer rating from 2000-2002 — his three years as the full-time Eagles starter (though he missed six games last year with an injury) — or his throwing for 3,365 yards and 25 touchdowns in 2001.

**Apologies for last weekend’s column.**

It was brought to my attention that I made two errors in my writing. It is the '62 Mets who hold the record for most losses in a season (excuse: typo), and the high school record for the longest field goal is 68 yards by Dick Borgonone, set in 1985 in Reno, Nevada (excuse: stupidity). Thanks fellas...

The Los Angeles Lakers canceled practice on Sunday to take a field trip across the island of Oahu in Hawaii. Phil Jackson thought it would be a good idea for the team to get out of the hot gym where reporters scrapped to ask questions about the Kobe Bryant case and treat the team to play some paintball. Poor Shaq, at 7-3 and 340 lbs., was picked last...

Continuing with big-bodied basketball players, 6-9 power forward Chris Webber recently signed with the Leicester Riders of the BBL, that’s British Basketball League for you (I know what you’re thinking: this error has to be on purpose). This Chris Webber, however, is white, from Canada, and went to Western University in Ottawa...

And on to littler basketball players, 5-2 Kendall Marshall is twelve years old and getting ready for his second season.WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 8, 2003

63 touchdowns (with just 31 interceptions) and rushing for 14 more. Furthermore, why would the media place their supposed desires for a black quarterback to succeed squarely on the shoulders of McNabb? Steve McNair is currently the second-highest rated passer in the NFL, and Daunte Culpepper, Michael Vick, and Aaron Brooks are all proven premier quarterbacks who also happen to be black. Even with Vick and Culpepper currently out with injuries, seven black quarterbacks started on Sunday. Instead of taking these issues into account, Limbaugh seems to have been more concerned with discrediting black players and any members of the media who attempt to give them the credit they deserve. Whether his goals were simply getting himself some of the publicity that he is known to love or pure bigotry, they are intolerable, hurtful, and nothing short of racist. And they must not be dismissed.

Despite the backlash that has followed Limbaugh’s unfortunate remarks, he has refused to back down. He has forfeited his chance to claim the comment as an ignorant mistake, saying, “All this has become the tempest that it is because I must have been right about something. If I wasn’t right, there wouldn’t be this cacophony of outrage that has sprung up in the sports writer community.” Racism itself is enough to incite outrage. Limbaugh should not have been given the opportunity to resign. He should have been fired.

Other nuggets:

Penrith Panthers upset the Sydney Roosters in the National Rugby League final in Sydney, Australia. On Sunday, in the pouring rain, the Panthers outscored the home team 18-6, and the Rooster fans cheered “cock-a-doodle-booooo!” 

In NHL action, the Buffalo Sabres beat the Columbus Blue Jackets 4-1. During the game, Columbus defender Andrej Nedorost checked Sabre forward Jochen Hecht into the boards from behind. Nedorost received a five-minute major and a one-game suspension while Hecht is out 6 to 8 weeks with a broken arm. Life’s just not fair sometimes...
