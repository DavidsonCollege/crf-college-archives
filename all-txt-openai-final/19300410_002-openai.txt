Monk’s Baseball Team Makes Successful Trip
Wildcats Lose to Wake Forest in Off Form Style

Coach “Monk's” diamond charges showed up very well as a whole on their first State trip of the season, and
except for a bow to the old Wake Forest jinx, would have had a perfect record. After displaying excellent ball
to down fighting teams at Elon and N. C. State, 9-6 and 5-4, respectively, the Wildcats slumped badly and, playing
miserable ball, lost to Wake Forest, 13-2. Poor hitting and worse fielding combined to make this a disastrous day.

Playing in miserably cold weather, more conducive to football than to baseball, the Wildcats were able to bunch their hits
and defeat Elon for the first time in four years. Davidson made four miscues, while Elon was credited with seven,
and they bunched their hits in the second and third to gain a safe lead. Armfield, Goodson, and McInnis hit
best, collecting eight safe blows between them. The pitching of McInnis and Lefty Briggs was about even.

On the following day at Raleigh, N. C. State was downed, 5-4. After a bad first inning, when the Techmen
scored three times on two triples, a double and a single, Kugler settled down and only allowed two hits for
the rest of the afternoon. In the seventh, the ’Cats scored three times to tie the score, and in the
eighth made two more to clinch the game. McInnis continued his good hitting by garnering a home run, and for
the second consecutive day, Parrish hit a triple. Turner and Hargrave hit best for State, while Averette allowed the same
number of hits as did Kugler.

Wildcat Golfers to Meet Wake Forest

Wake Forest will furnish the opposition for the Davidson golf team in the first intercollegiate match of the year on
Saturday, April 12, at the Charlotte Country Club. The rest of the tentative schedule, although not yet fully complete, includes
matches with the following: Concord Country Club at Concord, April 14; Wake Forest at Raleigh, April 17; North Carolina State
at Raleigh, April 18; and Carolina at Sedgefield, April 25. This month of play will be ended when the Wildcat
golfers enter the State Tournament at Sedgefield, April 26. On May 3, North Carolina State will be played at Charlotte.
A trip which will probably be made in the middle of May is being planned by the team captain, Jack
Pepper, and a journey which will include three South Carolina colleges, Clemson, Presbyterian College, and Furman.

The team at present is composed of two upperclassmen and two freshmen. Other members besides Captain Pepper are Jack Wagner,
John Thompson, and W. Lewis Hart. The position of the latter named is yet in doubt, as it is open
to challenge by the rest of the candidates for the team. The competition for the fourth place will be terminated
by the end of this week, and the winner will be given a permanent position on the team, Captain Pepper
divulged. The team playing the University of North Carolina at the tournament will be composed entirely of upperclassmen, and thus
the yearling members will be replaced by two of the following: R. D. Croom, Jr., N. C. Hodgin, and John
D. McConnell.

Davidson Trackmen Overwhelm Furman
Captain Heath Whittle is High Point Man of Meet

The Wildcat trackmen won their second dual meet of the season Saturday by defeating Furman, 90 to 35. The time
of most of the events was exceptionally good, two equalling the college record and another almost as good as the
record. In three of the matches Davidson took all three places, and in five of the events they took first
and second to show their superiority over the visiting team.

Captain Heath Whittle, Wildcat captain, led the Wildcats to victory with 15 points, and was high point man of the
meet. In the two hurdle events Whittle tied the college records which he holds. Lafferty, in the mile run, came
within six-tenths of a second of the record. The Wildcats are in readiness for the Georgia Tech relays and are
fairly strong in all events. In several of the events they are expecting to place. Following is a summary of
the meet:

Mile run—Lafferty, D., Pearson, F., Goodwin, D. Time, four minutes, 41.6 seconds.

D. Distance, 178 feet, three inches. Shot put—Carson, F., Boyle, D., Wood, F. Distance, 38 feet, nine inches.

Mascot of Senior Class Is Selected

At a recent meeting of the Senior Class, pretty little Miss Betty Pritchet was selected as the mascot of the
Class of ’30. Betty is three years old, and is the daughter of Captain and Mrs. N. G. Pritchet. Her
father is the head of the Physical Education Department of the college. Betty was the unanimous choice of the class
because of her great attractiveness and charm, and the members of the Senior Class boast that she is one of
the most attractive mascots in recent years.

Motorist: “Is it very far to the next town?”
Native: “Well, it seems farther’n it is, but it ain’t.”
He: “So you think it would be foolish for me to marry a girl who is my mental inferior?”
She: “No, impossible.”
“Is she a wonderful girl?”
“Yes, figuratively speaking.”

With numerous errors aiding the Deacons and with the worst hitting of the season for the Davidson nine, Wake Forest
tromped on a tame Wildcat, 13-2. Seemingly tired at the end of their three-game trip, the ’Cats looked in no
way like the nine that had downed Elon and N. C. State.

A cigarette it’s ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER than words; what you want to know about a cigarette is how it tastes.
And words can’t tell you much about Chesterfield’s taste. Tobacco quality, mild fragrance, character—these are only words, until you've tried
Chesterfield; after that, three words say it all: “TASTE above everything” MILD...and yet THEY SATISFY
