Hauerwas lectures offer
provocative view of pacifism

By KIRSTEN RECKNAGEL
Staff Writer

“I'd rather be described as
outrageous than provocative,”
Stanley M. Hauerwas said as he
stepped behind the podium in the
900 Room last Monday.

Rowe Professor of Theologi-
cal Ethics at Duke University,
Hauerwas is the author of several
books, including Character and
the Christian Life, and The Peace-
able Kingdom.

Last week Hauerwas visited
Davidson as part of the Religion
Department’s Otts Lecture Series.
Drawing an audience comprised
of students, faculty, and commu-
nity members, Hauerwas delivered
two lectures Sunday and Monday
under the umbrella title, “Why
Christians Should Be Pacifists: The
Ethics of War and Peace.”

In the course of his presenta-
tions, Hauerwas examined the
theory of “just war” and the “in-
trinsically nonviolent” nature of
Christianity.

The hour-long lectures,
marked by their controversial sub-
ject matter and Hauerwas’ dynamic
delivery, were followed by oppor-
tunities for members of the audi-
ence to address their own ques-
tions to Hauerwas.

Audience reviews seemed to
focus as much on Hauerwas’ man-
ner of presentation as on the sub-
ject of which he spoke. Professor
of Philosophy Alfred Mele, a long-
time friend of Hauerwas, remarked
that “his presentation was in his
typical lively style.”

Freshman Mark Gospodnetic
added that whether or not he wanted
to be viewed as such, “[Hauerwas]
definitely was provocative.”

Events of Eating Disorders Week seek to
raise awareness and to root out problems

By MATTHEW ERRICO
News Editor

This week the Women’s Is-
sues Committee is sponsoring a
series of events designed to
heighten the awareness and treat-
ment of eating disorders among
men and women.

Tuesday evening at 9 p.m. in
Richardson Plaza a Self-Esteem
Rally will encourage students to
throw away possessions which
make them feel angry or bad about
their bodies. Eating Disorders
Week coordinator Marianna
Whitehurst hopes the rally will
“start the week off with a lot of
energy” and will act as a “cathar-
sis” for those attending.
Whitehurst says she is parting
with a bathing suit that makes her
“feel fat.” Someone else is throw-
ing away her diet books, Whitehurst
says. Assistant Professor of Span-
ish Magdalena Maiz-Peña will act
as master of ceremonies and As-
sistant Chaplain Brenda Tapia will
give a benediction “in lieu of a
moment of silence, providing in-
spirational words of direction for
the week,” Whitehurst says.
Dying to Be Thin will play
Wednesday evening at 9 p.m. in
the Morrison Room of the Union.
A 35-minute film on anorexia and
bulimia, characters will reveal their
own troubles with eating disor-
ders. Whitehurst describes the
movie as “informational and expe-
riential.”

A forum at 8 p.m. in the 900
Room will focus on providing clini-
cal and experiential information to
members of the community. Psy-
