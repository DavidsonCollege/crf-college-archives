**Haiku/Tanka**

Silence . . . and the sun,  
Rising each morning as if  
You were still with me.

November rain turns  
Summer to fall, to winter—  
Sunsets never change.

Parting fellows! we've  
Filled another scrapbook with  
Colored, rustling days.

Winter's temperance—  
A shower of icicle  
Tears . . . the death of old  
Seasons, and albums—and a  
New bud appears between thorns.

12/31/82

Silvered ice flakes catch,  
Winking, slivers of moonlight  
From drifted temples.

1/1/83

The first robins sing  
In a fanfare of newness,  
And green awakens.

July mornings melt  
‘neath the insanity of  
Dewed leaves, wet grass . . . age.

1/2/83

Under a streetlight  
Two broken strangers bargain  
For intimacy.

Ageless dust settles  
On silent, patient cattle  
Grazing by the road.

Tempest! violent  
Days carry March to April,  
Tearing out flowers  
And crushing still waters, and  
Stones . . . tho’ the sun shines without.

Smoke, curling up from  
The jade of ashtrays in May  
Pretends to catch fire  
In the light of spring sunrise  
While showers hover nearby.

Dying embers spark  
In a final attempt at  
Fatality.

James Moore ’84

Becky, the flower girl,  
Squealing a smile  
In a four-year-old’s frenzy  
Flings her scented cargo to the world.

Rose petals fly from chubby palms to decorate  
The window aisles.

Becky, the flower child,  
In the deep-gold bedroom  
Curtained off with paperbacks  
Puffs smokescreens in rebellion  
Pushes for a place in the crowded  
Sixties.

Becky, the city child,  
Leaves the smoky room to air out,  
Learns along with off-duty firemen, clerks,  
Clears dish-strewn tables,  
Breaking her nails on the change left in  
Tips.

Becky, the city sister,  
Enters the great skyscraper forest  
To pound out new worlds with her fingers  
In her rent-controlled cell  
Bundling up to the purr of cats and  
Space heater.

Becky, the big sister,  
Lights another cigarette,  
Lets her ear patiently bend  
As confused tears flow through long-distance wires  
Looks back into her bottomless basket  
And finds some rose petals left for me.
