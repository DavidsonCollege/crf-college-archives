**Sayres reports on Palestine experiences**
Sayres Rudy

Last week I sat down for several hours and wrote you a piece. After my hard work and toil, I
took a walk along the streets of Amman, Jordan. When I returned and read my article, I found it pedantic,
platitudinous, moody, and long. Like most of my writing.

I’m back at my desk, after a day touring Baqa’a, the largest Palestinian refugee camp in the Middle East. If
you ever need to sober yourself and write a decent paragraph or two, visit a Palestinian refugee camp. Then don’t
describe it. Just develop the pictures.

It all started with a couple named Eve and Adam and it continues until, well, forever.

My name is Sayres and I was lucky to win a Watson Fellowship for this year. I’m traveling in Jordan
and Israel to learn more about and to feel the so-called homeland issue, the question of Palestine. By the way,
to the at least quarter of you who don’t know who the hell I am, I can’t offer sufficient consolation;
I’m usually the least important thing in anything I write, though, so I’m not terribly exclusive.

My project, getting back to my point, involves wide-eyed observation and investigation of one of the central issues in the
Middle East: The Israeli occupation since 1967 of the land not granted to Israel in the UN partition of Palestine
in 1947-8. The complexity of the issue and its history confounds me, stuns me. I can’t scrape the surface without
demanding—and probably ruining—your entire weekend.

It all started with a couple named Eve and Adam and it continues until, well, forever. I guess, up to
and including the Karachi massacre, Israel’s bombing of Tunisia last year, and the children of the children of the children
I saw today packed in their classroom in the Baqa’a camp.

I've read Chaim Potok and Elie Wiesel and seen enough footage of satanic Nazi inhumanity to live here forever without
losing my irrelevant objectivity. Most of us feel for Israel, I think. We are pro-Israel. We are perhaps pro-Israel to
the exclusion of some truths. I can feel the pressure just having written that. If I tell a bad truth
about Israel, will I become ineligible to serve our government? I hope not. I have always supported a democratic Israel,
and always will. But that is still a question I ask myself regularly while reporting what I see.

Other questions: To what extent is America, given its Constitution, consistent in supporting a theocracy which by its own declared
definition, may not be democratic? Is “armed struggle” a Palestinian policy? If so, does it help or hurt their cause?
Who represents the common Palestinian? What role should America play in the Middle East? Do all groups deserve their own
nation-states and homelands, that they may be the majority therein and protect themselves? Do the American Indians have a right
to kick you out of your house? Is it ever going to rain here? What are “rights” in terms of
land? Given its Charter, does the United Nations have a “right” to partition lands it does not own, and if
so, should the Basque separatists, Tamils, Sikhs, Christian Sudanese, or Palestinians be given homelands wherein they may be the secure
majority? Answers: yes, please.

Welcome to the Palestinian Problem, al mushkala fulistinia, and there, I’ve already shown off half my Arabic. Everyone here is
wrong. Or right. It doesn’t much matter. Ultimately, rights and wrongs only make people angry and self-righteous. Power, not morality,
has imposed the question.

If there is one Western illusion I would dispel if I could, it’s the illusion that the Arab mentality differs
from the mentality of the rest of the world, that Arabs are unintelligible, irrational, religious fanatics. Before believing, come here
and listen to Ronald Reagan, Jerry Falwell, Ariel Sharon, and Meir Kehane. Religious “fanaticism” exists here, as everywhere, but power
politics, self-interest, and survival are the motivating force behind Arab politics.

I admit that at first I was shaken when I found out who is the latest to sell Iran arms:
Iraq. Is it irrational, though, even though it sounds crazy? It’s another case of the leaders playing with the lives
of the followers. Remember trench warfare? That wasn’t the Middle East in WWI, it was the enlightened, rational West.

It’s war. Either we're all irrational in war or none of us are. It’s hard to draw the line when
people are killing people. But at home in the U.S., haven’t we drawn the line against the Arabs? Rational explanations,
I assure you, underlie Arab actions. I cannot emphasize that enough.

In the same breath Americans say that Israel needs our massive aid program because the Israelis must protect themselves from
the monolithic and aggressive Arab foe, and we say that the Arabs are constantly divided and fighting one another, and
therefore must be crazy. How can we believe both statements? Sure, Arab states fight and quarrel. That’s what countries do.
It’s not irrational; at least it’s normal. What kills me is that we don’t usually give them a way out.
Either they are the irrational monolith or the irrational bickerers.

Arabs are rational. I’ve talked with many of them, with many Palestinians who have left or have been forced to
leave what they call Palestine, and have been refused re-entry.

Because our government is involved, each of us is involved. We all bombed Libya. We all pour money into the
conflict. My first point was that the fundamental motivation underlying behavior here, like everywhere, is power politics, realism, self-interest. My
second point is this, and it involves all of us and our self-interest as Americans: the Arabs and Israelis are
at war and have been since 1948. The huge flare-ups in 1948, 1956, 1967, and 1973 were peaks. The war
is constant, the military activity, the killing, perennial. You are involved because the U.S. has chosen sides. We are pro-Israel.
The Americans are, indirectly or directly.bombing of Lebanon did not look good. They don’t hate Americans or Jews. They hate
Zionism. They see Zionism as expansionist and violent. They see the bombing of Tunisia. They see the Israeli invasion of
Lebanon from 1982 to this day. They see the occupation of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank long after
the dust settled from 1967, 1973, and the Camp David Accord which brought Egypt out of the equation for Israeli
security. The Arabs talk about the Israeli prison camp called Ansar in Southern Lebanon, where they say Israeli soldiers torture
and urinate on suspects taken on whim and held without charge. Arabs see Americans condemn terrorism. Arabs see Americans kill
over one hundred Libyans in a terrorist assassination attempt. Arabs see America give 48 percent of its global non-military aid
and 35 percent of its military aid to the Israelis. Arabs also see the official Amnesty International reports confirming Israeli
human rights violations.

Please do not confuse the above perceptions with my views. I have thus far only asked questions and reported a
view. I implore you to free your mind of its various constraints, in order to judge the Arab perceptions on
their own merits. That’s asking a lot, especially of people who wouldn’t mind being left alone to enjoy the green
grass and Robert Frost; I myself confess to committing the American atrocity of wanting to be left alone to do
what I want. I ask you to question your assumptions because you are infinitely involved in the whole world, by
virtue of being subject to a democratic government that infinitely involves itself in the whole world. Despite my multitudinous objections
to Thoreau’s brilliant essay on civil disobedience, I think he was right about the war in Mexico. No individual would
go fight it on his own volition; they went because the government made a decision. Now I am no anarchist.
In fact, I’m so confused I’m still a registered Independent! But Thoreau would ask you, What do you know about
Savimbi? How about Mobutu? Pastora? Zia? You and I trust our government about all those thugs because our government does
what it does to protect us. And I firmly believe that our well-being is the goal of all our administrations,
whether I quarrel here and there or not. It’s okay to not know how you are involved way over here.
I would argue that the U.S. doesn’t owe the world a living nor resolutions to all its impassioned conflicts. As
far as I know you don’t owe anything to anyone, except possibly to yourself.

My friend Jon is okay, and please excuse the solipsistic reference to my essay, “My Friends,” which the Davidsonian printed
last year. I talked to Jon this summer, and he said the shrapnel came out with only small scars, and
he’s happy to be alive. Jon was in Rome at the airport last December when the Arab Abu Nidal terrorist
group massacred people at the ticket counter of the Israeli airline, El-Al. Jon jumped over the counter as a grenade
bounced toward him and exploded, stabbing metal into his legs and head.
