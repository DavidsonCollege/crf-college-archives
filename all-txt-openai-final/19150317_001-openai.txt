The Treble Clef Club Gives Good Program

The Readings and Vocal Selections Much Enjoyed By All.

The students and residents of the town of Davidson were entertained by the Treble Clef Club of the Alkahest Lyceum
System last Saturday night in Shearer Hall. Although the house was not packed, there was a goodly number present, and
the program was enjoyed very much.

The club consists of four young ladies, and the program included vocal quartets, vocal solos, duets, readings, and costume sketches.
One of the best features of the evening was the vocal work of Miss Bales. She has a high soprano
voice, and her solos were highly entertaining. The vocal solos of Miss Dashton as an accompanist, and Miss Taylor in
her readings, were also worthy of praise. The quartet, dressed in colonial costume, sang many of the old Scotch songs.

The management hopes to secure another attraction here before the season closes, but is unable to say just now whether
there will be another one or not. However, if there are no more, holders of season tickets will be reimbursed
for the numbers which were not given.

QUEENS COLLEGE GLEE CLUB TO COME SOON

One of the highest class entertainments of the season at Davidson will be here next Monday night, March 22, when
Queens College Glee Club gives their concert under the auspices of the Athletic Association. This organization needs no introduction to
Davidson men, as all know of the high-class reputation of everything connected with Queens College. This is the second time
this Glee Club has been seen at Davidson, having come up last spring for a concert under the able management
of “Bum” Pharr. All of the old students know what a pleasing concert was given last year. From all reports
coming from Queens, they have a much better Glee Club this year than last. Under the able leadership of Miss
Carol Baker, the club has shown ability not often seen in organizations of this sort. Miss Baker is a celebrated
Marchesi pupil and has met with great success throughout Europe. She has a repertoire of more than ten operas, including
“Manon,” “Lakme,” “La Boheme,” “Romeo et Juliette,” “Faust,” etc.

There will be twenty-four members in all in the Glee Club, and they will arrive on the night train from
Charlotte. The concert will start promptly at 8:15 p.m., and all are urged to be there promptly in order to
get a seat. Every loyal Davidson man should be present at this concert for several reasons, chief of which is
the fact that they will be here under the auspices of the Athletic Association, and every ticket sold is just
that much toward bringing good baseball to Davidson this spring. The members of the Glee Club will be entertained in
the homes of the faculty, and the management wishes to take this opportunity to express their hearty thanks to all
who have so kindly and willingly offered them entertainment.

Spring training has begun in horseshoe throwing, and this annual game is as popular this season as usual.

DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N. C., MARCH 17, 1915. NO. 23

Dr. Graham Conducts Special Services

Former Pastor to Preach Series of Sermons In Davidson.

Dr. Alfred W. Graham, former pastor of the Presbyterian church here, and now pastor of the Presbyterian church at Lexington,
Va., is conducting a series of special services this week for the benefit of the town and college. Dr. Graham
is preaching every afternoon at 3:30 and every night at 7:30, thus affording everyone a convenient opportunity of attending at
least once a day. Dr. Graham opened his services Sunday morning with a strong, forceful sermon, showing very clearly the
superiority of the Christian religion over every other existing religion. Outlining the various religions of the world, Dr. Graham showed
the inherent weakness of each one, and how the Christian religion contained every good point of the other religions of
today. Dr. Graham showed that the Bible is the only religious book claiming Divine origin, and the only book which
teaches the right conception of God—a God of mercy, power, holiness, and truth—and finally the fact that the Bible is
as powerful in one language as in another.

It is interesting to hear the alumni speak in loving terms of Dr. Graham, who was pastor here for sixteen
years, leaving in 1909. It is hoped that all Davidson men will avail themselves of this fine opportunity of hearing
this much-loved pastor.

Mrs. Coleman and her small son returned to their home in Knoxville last week.‘The honor roll of the Davidson High

ANNUAL BUSINESS.

W. A. McIlwaine and J. B. Faw, the editor and manager of the Annual, found it necessary to take a
business trip to Atlanta last week to see Foote & Davies, the publishers of the 1915 Annual. It seems that
Foote & Davies have changed the manager of their collegiate department, and as many of the arrangements made with the
former manager were merely verbal, it became necessary for more definite arrangements to be made and for certain points of
business to be cleared up. McIlwaine and Faw returned from their trip Tuesday noon.

Dr. Reavis, a man who already in his heart counts himself a friend to all Davidson boys and their true
interests,

DR. REAVIS GIVES SPLENDID ADDRESS

Last Thursday night, the Davidson Y. M. C. A. enjoyed one of the finest addresses ever heard at Davidson, when
Dr. J. O. Reavis, Professor of the English Bible at Columbia Seminary, spoke of his recent trip to the Congo
Mission in Africa. Dr. Reavis started at New York and proceeded to take his hearers over every part of his
trip. Possessing all the qualities of a good speaker, Dr. Reavis also has a unique way of picturing different scenes
and events. As he described his trip up the Congo river his hearers seemed to see the beautiful scenery, the
luxuriant tropical plant life, and the natives on the banks. So great a hold did Dr. Reavis have on his
audience that he could have his hearers laughing heartily one moment and almost shedding tears the next. His account of
his eating ants, killing a hippopotamus, and “hitting the continent of Africa” several times were exceedingly funny. On the other
hand, Dr. Reavis closed with a stirring appeal for more men to help supply the great need in Africa at
this critical time. As an evidence of how his audience enjoyed Dr. Reavis’ address, he was given quite an ovation
at the train as he left soon after the meeting.

DR. B. F. WILSON TO PREACH HERE SOON

Dr. B. F. Wilson, of Harrisonburg, Va., will preach the Commencement Y. M. C. A. Sermon here. Dr. Wilson is
an old Davidson alumnus, was for twelve years President of Converse College, and is at present the pastor of a
large church in Virginia. The Y. M. C. A. is fortunate in securing him.

Huntersville. On Thursday, the 18th, the Varsity played the All-Stars in the first game of the season. It showed that
the aggregation is fast rounding into shape, but due to the fact that such men as Cashion, Booe, "Ty Cobb"
Caldwell, and Coach Fetzer, composed the All-Stars, the Varsity was defeated by the score of 8 to 7. However, they
equaled the All-Stars in hitting, both securing nine bingles. Christenbury has started the season right on the bases, swiping four
sacks during the game. Captain Alford is hitting in mid-season form, obtaining a three-base hit and a single. Somerville, Black,
and Saunders did some fine fielding. Groom started on the rubber for the Varsity, and in spite of the fact
that he has been suffering with a sore arm for some time, pitched well. Lawson replaced him in the fourth,
and let the All-Stars down with one hit, Caldwell securing that. Morris was sent in in the seventh to replace
Lawson, and showed up well. The fielding of Cashion and Booe played an important part in the locals’ defeat. Caldwell
led the All-Stars with the willow, securing four hits out of five times at bat. However, they seemed unable to
steal bases on Captain Alford's quick and accurate peg. The outfield seems slow in rounding into form, but the material
is good, and in the course of time they will come around all right.
