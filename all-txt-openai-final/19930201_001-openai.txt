**Student, Dean Rusk Program Bring South Asia to Davidson**

By Alice Felmlee

When students become homesick they often reach for the phone or head home for the weekend. For Don Jayasinghe this
is a little more difficult. His house, family, and friends are in Sri Lanka. During the week of February 7-15,
however, Don will feel close to home as Davidson celebrates South Asia Week ’93. Beginning with a classical sitar performance
and concluding with a talk by Tibetan Monks, the week-long program will “bring prominence to a region otherwise known for
its ethnic problems and violence.” With such a vested interest in the area, Jayasinghe, a member of the Student Advisory
Committee, offered to spearhead the project in conjunction with the Dean Rusk Program and other supporting organizations such as the
Chaplain’s Office, SGA, the Solidarity Committee, Women’s Issues, and the Economics, Anthropology, and Political Science Departments.

Although South Asia Week found a lot of support amongst school-wide organizations and faculty members, the challenge of organizing the
event came with the desire for more student involvement. Unlike the Union’s annual...

**Davidson Historian Awarded for Service**

By Mandy Curtis

Chalmers G. Davidson, historian and direct descendant of the college’s namesake, has recently been awarded the state’s highest civilian honor,
The Order of the Long Leaf Pine. Awarded by Governor James G. Martin, Davidson earned the honor for his many
years of community service to the state of North Carolina.

Originally from Chester, South Carolina, Davidson graduated summa cum laude from Davidson College in 1928. He went on to receive
his master’s and doctorate in history from Harvard University and his master’s in library science from the University of Chicago.
He returned to Davidson in 1936 as a history professor and director of the library where he served both for
40 years. Davidson has been the college archivist since 1975 and at the age of 85 continues to work regularly
in the library.

Davidson’s life work has been devoted to the study of regional history and to Davidson College. Davidson has served as
president of the North Carolina Literary and Historical Association, president of the Historical Society of North Carolina, chairman of the
North Carolina Writers Conference, president of the Mecklenburg Historical Association, and the first president of the Latta Place Inc.

**On Tuesday, January 26 Davidson students elected Alden Smith and Alice Spivey as SGA President and Vice President.**

By Leigh Rawdon

“Alden and Alice have both worked very hard the past three years on the SGA. I am confident they will
do a great job,” said current SGA President Anthony Foxx. “I don’t want to limit the SGA to the many
temporary goals it can accomplish this year. The SGA must present itself to the faculty, the administration, and the Trustees
as an example of what we stand for as a student body- what we believe in," Smith said, "Our focus
this year will be diversity- both in terms of recruiting different types of students and nurturing the diversity we have
at Davidson now.”

Merrill Earnest, Jason Bradley, and Vincent Choo ran unopposed for Union Board President, Vice President-Social, and Vice President-Co-Curricular respectively. The
SGA officially approved these three candidates Tuesday evening. Earnest hopes “to broaden the...

**Davidson Seniors Honored by Who's Who**

By Rachel Dunifon

This winter 43 Davidson seniors received announcements of their selection into Who’s Who Among Students in America’s Colleges and Universities.
Who’s Who is “an annual honors program honoring our nation’s leading college students.” Over 1,000 schools in the United States
confer the honor of nomination to Who’s Who upon...Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

Their most outstanding students. Each college or university, through its own nominating committee, selects a number of students to receive
this honor, working under the limits of a quota established by Who’s Who. According to Who’s Who, this process of
local selection “serves to highlight the individual and diverse talents of America’s most prominent students.” Davidson’s nominating committee was led
by Dean of Students, Will Terry. According to Terry, his committee of 30 juniors and 30 faculty members was chosen
“so every major division of the college was represented.” This committee, working from a list of the entire senior class,
voted individually on the people they felt “had made significant contributions to the college,” in any way they deemed important.

Although selection in Who’s Who is not accompanied by monetary rewards, Terry thinks that it

Menkhaus Shares Personal Insight on Somalia

By Sally Stone

Davidson Political Science professor, Dr. Ken Menkhaus, currently holds the titles of consultant to the United Nations, State Department, and
expert on Somalia. Tuesday night Menkhaus spoke about Somalia’s past, present, and future at the Dean Rusk foreign affairs forum.
Having written his doctorate thesis on Somalia and worked in the country within the past two years, Menkhaus is one
of the very few U.S. academics familiar with the country. This past October he served on a six-member State Department
panel organized to lend expert opinion on the three options the government had determined to be the most feasible in
dealing with Somalia.

Between August and October of 1992, the U.S. narrowed its options to cutting off food aid entirely in order to
halt the looting by rival clans; continue food relief and try to strike a deal with the clan warlords; or,
finally, intervene and attempt to save the one million Somalis at risk of death, over 300,000 had already perished from
famine and fighting. Menkhaus informed the audience Tuesday night that five of the
