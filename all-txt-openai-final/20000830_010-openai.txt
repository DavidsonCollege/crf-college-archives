**Press RELEASE**

What higher honor is there than representing your country at the Olympics? Two members of the Davidson community — one athletic staff member and one student-athlete — will experience the thrill of international competition at the Olympic and Paralympic Games held in Sydney, Australia, in September and October.

Swimmer Kendra Berner ’02 and Wildcat head baseball coach Dick Cooke will travel to the “land down under” as representatives of the United States in the world’s most prestigious international competition. Berner will compete in the Paralympics, while Cooke will be an auxiliary coach for the USA Olympic Baseball Team.

To say Berner is excited about the competition would be an understatement. “I am excited to be a part of the games, caught up in the Olympic spirit and representing the United States,” said Berner. “I’ve never been anywhere near as far away as Australia, so that will be thrilling, too.”

In order to qualify for the Paralympics, Berner had to compete in the USA Disability Championships in Indianapolis on June 23-25. Physical disabilities are split up into 10 separate classifications, with S1 being the most disabled, and S10 being the least. Berner, who was born with a congenital deformation of her right hand, was placed in the S10 classification. Having only one hand to use in the water, Berner utilizes a training paddle, which is cut to the size and shape of her left hand. The paddle was initially approved to use in high school, and prior to swimming at Davidson, was approved by the NCAA. Other swimmers in her classification ranged in age from 11 to 38, but most were no match for Berner. In six events, she won five, setting American records in three of them — 50 Free (29.70 seconds), 100 Free (1:04.75), and 400 Free (5:08.26).

**Men’s Soccer kicks off new season with home exhibition**

To the beat of garbage can drums and a student band of trumpets and accordions, the Davidson men’s soccer team played to a 0-0 tie Tuesday night against Winthrop in their first exhibition of the season. Despite out-shooting Winthrop 12-4 and 9-0 on corner kicks, the Wildcats still could not get rid of the goose egg on the home side of the scoreboard. The pace lulled along for a major portion of the evening until a late second-half charge by the Wildcats. However, Davidson was unable to take advantage of numerous shot opportunities and corner kicks.

Nevertheless, Head coach Charlie Slagle was very impressed by the team’s first starting lineup of the season. He quoted conditioning, defense, and ball possession as the high points of Davidson’s game. Slagle also commended Chris Norbert, Jon Tetirick, and Paul Watson, all juniors, on their outstanding efforts. David Buehler ‘01 left the game due to injury in the 69th minute, but he is now back and kicking according to Slagle.

Coming off a roller coaster season of a year ago, Slagle and the Wildcats are hoping that their 17 returning players can better last year’s 10-11 (5-3) record. The 1999 team was ranked as high as #5 in the country, and victories over Clemson, South Carolina, and Richmond last year will give the veterans enough confidence to post more impressive victories this year. September 1 will be the Wildcat’s first game of the season, playing against Towson University in the first round of the Navy Invitational Soccer Tournament. Davidson’s first home game this season will be on September 15 against Virginia Tech.

This game, however, is about much more than the final score. The Davidson Soccer Program will be participating in a charity drive called the “Gift of Life.” This drive raises money to pay for heart surgery for children who cannot afford it. Every year, doctors at the University of South Carolina Medical Center donate supplies and hospital space, while teams in the southeast provide the money. As always, students get into the game free, but all are encouraged to bring donations for this worthwhile cause. Slagle is aiming for Davidson to present a $7500 check to the cause, an amount that is certainly attainable with everyone’s participation. Success in the upcoming season looks promising for the Davidson Wildcats, both on and off the field.

**Brazil Trip**

**How They Spent Their Summer Vacation**

The men’s soccer team took a team trip to Brazil during the summer. The trip proved to be a great opportunity for all willing players to experience tough competition on an entirely different continent. The Wildcats played six games on their trip and compiled a record of 1-4-1. This number is much more admirable, though, when considering the opponents. The ‘Cats played professional junior teams that provided “great competition.” It is yet to be decided, however, if this pre-season journey will improve this year’s record.% ts ek Gp and 7.66 seconds, respectively. She didn’t view her competitors as enemies, however. “We were competing against each other, but for the most part, it was a friendly competition. Some of the people were a little more fierce in their competitiveness than others, though.” 

Berner, an economics major, also won the 100 Breaststroke (1:40.62) and the 200 Individual Medley (2:51.92), while garnering second place in the 100 Backstroke (1:21.86). “The trials were really amazing,” commented Berner. “I had never been to a national meet, or an adaptive meet before. All the swimmers there had worked extremely hard, and I met so many cool people. One girl had both arms and legs amputated, and she was a really good swimmer. She was just so graceful in the water.”

Berner also holds her own at the Division I level against swimmers who have no physical disabilities. She is a member of two relay teams at Davidson that hold school records — the 400 Free and 800 Free. But perhaps a bigger challenge than her competition in Sydney will be figuring out how to manage her studies while in Australia for nearly the entire month of October. “I’ve petitioned for three classes instead of four,” Berner remarked. “Prior to leaving, I will work with professors on different ways to make up the class time and keep up with the work — get audio tapes of lectures, whatever it takes to get the work done.”

Cooke, on the other hand, will be a representative of his country. “It’s amazing to think that I won’t have to worry about studies or even how the players are doing in their advance classes. All the athletes on the baseball squad are professional ballplayers and don’t have a tough 400 level class with which to keep up. I love coaching in the collegiate ranks,” stated Cooke, a former player in the Boston Red Sox organization. “But it’s nice to be around professional baseball people. I can take a break from worrying about anything other than baseball.”

The international scene is not a new one to Cooke. Last year, he was an auxiliary coach for the Pan American Games in Winnipeg, Canada. “The great thing about the Pan Am Games was that so much was on the line,” Cooke said. “Knowing that we had to win at least the silver to advance to the Olympics heightened the intensity level.”

The legendary Tommy Lasorda, the former Los Angeles Dodger manager, will manage the Olympic baseball team, replacing the Pan Am manager, Buddy Bell. Bell is now managing the Colorado Rockies. Lasorda’s coaches will be former major league manager Phil Regan, former major leaguer Reggie Smith, and minor league manager Eddie Rodriguez. “This being the Olympics, we have a lot more attention focused on us,” noted Cooke. “Tommy is such a great ambassador of baseball that he alone draws attention to the team.”

As an auxiliary coach, Cooke’s duties include throwing batting practice to the hitters. He is the left-handed throwing pitcher, while friend and South Carolina head coach Ray Tanner is the right-handed batting practice pitcher. Cooke will also handle the scouting of the other teams at the Olympic Games, although he’s not sure to what degree he will be involved with the scouting. “It depends a lot on how Tommy delegates and utilizes his personnel,” Cooke said. “From what I have seen, though, he is not afraid to rely on his staff for information.”

Unlike last year, Cooke has given input on the players that are being evaluated in the minor leagues that will possibly join the team. The most difficult aspect of that task is choosing players who are good enough to help the United States, but won’t be called up to the major leagues prior to August 31, when the team leaves for Australia. If a player is in the majors, he will not be eligible for Team USA. The baseball games don’t officially begin until Sept. 17, and last until the 27th.

Cooke’s experience last year also had an effect on the Davidson baseball team last spring. The Wildcats finished their best season in eight years. After being exposed to different perspectives of advance scouting, he blended his coaching with those perspectives. “One thing I always worried about before was overloading our players with too much information,” stated Cooke. “They have so much on their minds here at Davidson as it is, particularly their studies. I didn’t force-feed the scouting reports to them; I just made them available, and the players seemed to benefit from those reports.”

The reports that the Davidson community will be waiting for are the ones on the accomplishments of its members. Both Berner and Cooke will be striving for the gold, but just going to the Olympics is a tremendous achievement in itself. “It’s such an honor just to be representing the United States,” said Berner. “It’s amazing to think that I will be a representative of my country. I can’t wait.”
