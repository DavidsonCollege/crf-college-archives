Question of the Week

A misunderstanding of long duration has been present between the Athletic Association and the students about “guest” football tickets. Recently
Mr. Shepard of the Athletic Association announced that hereafter the system would be to sell “guest” tickets to students at
half price up to 200 tickets. In order to get a cross-section of student opinion, this question was put to
some of the students: “What do you think of the new system of ‘guest’ football tickets?”

Julian Lokey—Senior
Student tickets for football games constitute a great idea. The Athletic Association is to be commended highly for such splendid
action. The benefit derived is not single fold, for it is not only the student who is helped. Quite true,
the students’ pocketbooks are tremendously helped by the 50% deduction, and still the Athletic Association is benefitted, for more boys
will have guests, making up for the association's loss in deduction. More girls will frequent the games; hence more color
and spirit for the occasions. The Association had just grounds for discontinuing this scheme under the old system, because when
any privilege is grossly abused, it should be removed. This new system, preceded by a detailed explanation, will be a
success. I am of the opinion that Davidson gentlemen will honor this plan and abide by its regulations. The spirit
created and the benefit derived will be evident in just a short time; therefore, may this plan be permanently established.

Jack White—Junior
I think the idea is good but, as I understand it, the guest tickets are limited to girls only. I
believe that a guest ticket should include any guest. I am glad, however, that this perennial question has been settled
once and for all.

Wilson McDiarmid—Sophomore
I think that the new system of guest tickets for football games is fair. It avoids the controversy that was
prevalent in the old system. The new system will prevent students from indulging in “ticket scalping” and will afford greater
satisfaction all around. Now that each student is limited to one ticket per game, those students who in the past
have been unable to secure tickets in the best sections will be able to do so now. Besides helping the
students by giving them a better variety of tickets, it will help the Athletic Association and will save lots of
time and trouble. Also, it will increase the sales of tickets at football games.

Bob Doty—Senior
This seems to me to be as good an arrangement as could be made and certainly more satisfactory than those
of previous years. Personally, I appreciate, and I believe that the majority of the students do, the fact that the
officers of the Athletic Association recognize the tradition of “girl’s tickets” and were willing to undertake the expense of keeping
up this tradition. The settlement of this question ought to be perfectly agreeable to all students, I believe.

Bill Hamilton—Junior
I think that the plan for reduced price football tickets is fine. The two hundred available tickets will be plenty
in almost every case. Having a set rule as to the price, quantity, and use, will do away with the
constant bickering and ill feeling of the past. As I see it, there is only one disagreeable factor in this
new plan; that is, that only a girl friend may be admitted on this ticket. There was this fault with
the former “girl's tickets.” It seems to me that each student should have the privilege of using his “guest ticket”
as he pleases for father, mother, brother, or friend. What would be the harm in this? One person occupies as
much space as another and it would be easier on the student’s pocketbook if he could take any guest on
this ticket rather than having to pay full price for a reserved seat.

John E. W. Clark—Sophomore
I think that the new system of guest football tickets will be a great asset to both the college and
the students. Heretofore students have abused the purchase of such tickets and now with the present system, tickets are limited
to the students as it should be. The present difficulty is due to confusion with the old. Ticket sales will
undoubtedly rise and this will help both the team and the Athletic Association. Perhaps now, with such a plan on
what seems to me a very fair and economical basis, more students will strive for the first two hundred guest
tickets. However, after the first two hundred are sold, a student may obtain a ticket at full price and also
the adjoining seat free. Since this plan is more than fair to both parties concerned, the system now in effect
should, and, I think, will work. A great deal of conflict will be avoided and time saved.

The athletic department has also provided sports equipment to be checked out by the students. This idea reigns as an
innovation on the hill. Footballs, basketballs, and other such sports equipment may be secured by any student for use in
the afternoons.

Harwell Darby Elected President of Reporters Club
First Year Man Will Act As Vice-President

Harwell Darby was elected president and Ed Lucas secretary and treasurer of the Reporter’s Club at the meeting held at
the end of last year. No vice president was elected, as this office was to be filled by a member
of the class of ’43. Since the Club has not met this year, this office is not filled.

Club Revived

This was the first meeting of this organization which had been inactive for the last several years. Plans were made
for this year and a general effort was made to revive the Club. Meetings will be held every Friday night.

Reverend Crowe used as his text the last verse in the last chapter of Second Corinthians, which reads, “The grace
of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with you
all.” This benediction has been used for centuries to close Christian services and has been taken as a mere dismissal.
It goes much deeper. The benediction is really a prayer that these blessings contained therein, be realized in you and
by you. This passage was used by Paul, in his letter to the Corinthians to describe to them the beauty
of Jesus Christ.

The Davidson Wildcat band celebrated its twentieth anniversary during the Davidson-Duke game last Saturday. This band, the largest ever formed
on the Davidson campus, was led on this occasion by four strutting drum majors and the flag bearers. The high
steppers are Fred Chetwood, head drum major, of Johnson City, Tennessee, Bob Garvey of Winston-Salem, Carl Rowland of Charlotte, and
Bill Norman of Mooresville. W. R. Pope of Mount Mourne, and Theron Sain of Morganton are the two flag bearers.
In twenty years the band has grown from 28 to 78 pieces. (Staff photo by Angus Lytch)

in regard to the painting of Western scenes by infantry drill in former years. The 19th. Other Reviews are set
by the President of Hampden Sydney this year, and Dr. W. K. J. Foreman, of the Davidson Faculty, who was
the substitute pastor during the summer. The Court announced that no new evidence had been obtained. The only evidence in
possession of the Court at present is of a circumstantial nature. However, the Court does announce that if more evidence
is not discovered, action will be delayed for an extended period.

The reason for this phenomenon is the complete revamping of army drill regulations which went into effect this fall. All
members of the local corps, from the commandant down to the greenest private, are having to learn together an entirely
new drill.

Numerous Changes

The personnel of various units, starting with the squad and including all the larger groups, has been altered. Not only
must the soldier accustom himself to new formations and personnel, but the very manual of arms has been revised. An
additional count has been added to most movements, damaging the "snap," but making them easier for the raw recruit.

In the schools of the soldier, the command "Stand at Ease" has been abolished and its former manner of execution
is now "Parade Rest." In an effort to simplify steps and marchings, the cadence has been slowed down to 120
steps per minute instead of the former 128. Double time remains the same. Men line up at a far greater
interval than before. Normal interval is now arm's length. This tends to make movements and formations simpler but less compact.

All marches of any distance are executed in column to avoid the difficult dressing of a long line. This, together
with the fact that the squad is now a single rank, has obviated the necessity of Squad Right, the so-called
basic movement of the old drill.

Several changes have been made to make commands less abrupt, such as "Dress Right, Dress" and "Ready, Front." Also less
abrupt are startings and halts, with no movement of the rifles without command.

Dr. Scott of the Department of Biology of Davidson, will speak tonight at the weekly pep meeting in the college
gym as a send-off for the V.M.I. game in Bluefield, West Virginia, Saturday. Under the direction of the cheer leader,
Loch Hunter, and his associates, Shelton, Abels, Williams, and Martin, much is expected. The band will furnish the musical touch
under the direction of Prof. Pfohl.

Friday night, preceding the Duke game, the Freshman class was led through their paces in a pep meeting in the
Bos. Hunter gave a brief pep talk to both freshmen and team. The meeting was aided by Hunter's promise to
freshmen to shirtail parade on condition that they yell their best.
