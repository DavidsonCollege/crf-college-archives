**Football Non-essential**

We all would like to have a good football program. But we can no longer afford it. Since a major football program is non-essential at a small liberal arts school such as Davidson, football must always be financially suspect. Rampant inflation and limited fundraising success dictate that the College eliminate luxuries to keep academics healthy. Close examination of the problem yields one rational conclusion of what is best for the College as a whole: intercollegiate football must be dropped. The benefits are small; the costs are great.

Inflation is hurting private schools everywhere. Many small private colleges are expected to fold under the pressure of rising energy and construction costs, inadequate faculty and staff compensation, and a projected decline in the number of high school graduates. Assuming that Davidson wants to maintain its academic standards, it has only three defenses against hard times—more productive fundraising, higher tuition and fees, or to cut expenditures.

Prospects for fundraising are not promising. Davidson's main fundraising campaign, the 1987 program, is just barely meeting its goals, but they have not been adjusted for inflation since 1972. Particularly in light of Development Director Duane Dittman’s recent resignation, along with two members of his staff, we have no reason to believe that success in fundraising will improve. The College has already been forced to raise tuition and fees $575 this year alone. Should this trend continue, Davidson will be in even more danger of becoming a school for the rich and will have trouble attracting qualified applicants from a decreasing pool of high school graduates.

Practically all College programs are already operating at subsistence level. Minor sports budgets will not be raised to compensate for inflation and almost all minor sports coaches maintain that even last year’s budgets were inadequate. According to the latest Update, the College is unable to make needed improvements in its heating and cooling system because of lack of funds. And the principal component of a Davidson education, the faculty, has been hit hardest of all. Faculty salaries have dropped against inflation every year since 1966. As a result, faculty morale and confidence in the administration’s priorities have been steadily dropping, and some of Davidson’s most respected faculty members, such as Drs. Avinger, Young, and Davies, have decided to secure employment elsewhere.

In light of all these financial difficulties, a $249,000 (1979 fiscal year) expenditure on football is unjustifiable. Unfortunately, moving to Division III competition would not significantly affect the program’s budget. Football has its benefits, but the College must put education first. Football does give the College publicity. However, such publicity comes in the wrong area and in ineffective amounts. Davidson’s reputation is that of a high-quality educational institution, not of a football power. And a Division I-AA team cannot attract widespread attention no matter how successful it is.

The football program also encourages a more diverse student body. However, the admissions department can select diverse classes with or without football players’ applications. Furthermore, admissions standards for football recruits and other athletes are lower than the standards for most applicants. This inequity means that some non-athletes might be turned away while equally or less qualified athletes are admitted.

Football is supposed to motivate alumni giving. However, elimination of the football program would not necessarily entail a great loss of income. Neither Marquette (in 1961) nor the University of Bridgeport (in 1974) suffered after they dropped football (See Davidsonian, April 25). Besides, the College should not allow a few sports-minded alumni to dictate the continuation of a program that is not in the best interest of the College as a whole.

Economic conditions threaten every aspect of the Davidson experience, particularly academics. In order to maintain its standards, the College must cut its losses. Football must go.

To the Editor:

Last Thursday I traveled to Washington D.C. to attend an anti-nuclear protest and lobbying effort sponsored by The Coalition For A Non-Nuclear World. Now having returned to Davidson I am more concerned than ever about the potential dangers of a nuclear energy policy and the dangers of continued apathy on the part of the Davidson community. Although...Non-nuclear sentiment seems to be growing, yet our government still advocates and pursues a pro-nuclear policy. The 95th and 96th Congresses defeated proposals to place moratoriums on the construction of nuclear reactors and waste disposal sites. Presently, there are 87 nuclear plants in the U.S., and by 1985 that figure is expected to climb to 139. These developments are alarming for several reasons. Historically, nuclear power has proved to be anything but the “safe, clean, and cheap” energy source the proponents of the 1950s claimed it to be. At Browns Ferry, Alabama, an electrical fire knocked out the circuits controlling the water level of the coolant necessary to prevent a meltdown. Only by the grace of God was a major nuclear catastrophe averted.

Earlier this year, a spill at Crystal River contaminated fish, wildlife, and vegetation in the area. From 1958 to 1975, twenty single-walled carbon steel tanks used to store nuclear waste leaked 430,000 gallons of high-level waste into the ground at the Hanford Military Reservation in Washington. A lot of the apathy surrounding nuclear power springs from ignorance of the deleterious effects of radiation. Radiation comes in three forms: gamma, beta, and alpha particles. Gamma rays may penetrate clothing and skin. Beta and alpha particles are called low-level radiation and can be absorbed through inhalation or ingestion. All particles are dangerous. There is no such thing as receiving your quota of radiation for a year. Radiation is additive, meaning that once it enters the body, it is there to stay and will not pass out of your body like other wastes.

Everyone on earth is constantly exposed to “background radiation” from sun rays penetrating the atmosphere and the natural presence of uranium, radon, and radium in the ecosphere. Scientists agree that radiation has detrimental mutagenic and carcinogenic effects on the human race. If nuclear power is to be accepted as a viable energy alternative, then it has to be 100% safe from meltdowns, leakages, waste disposal problems, generic defects in reactors, and human error. Waste is currently handled in two ways: it is either dumped in the ocean or carted off to sites on land called “pools” and buried. Waste containers are subject to corrosion from the nitric acid in the waste solution and from the chemical reactions that take place in the ocean. No land routes of disposal are free from sabotage or accidents that might occur while in transit. Furthermore, 400-500 pounds of plutonium are produced each year by each of our 87 reactors, and thus, logically, we will run out of space to bury it. With more waste, the chance of leakage increases.

Perhaps my major beef against nuclear power rests in the eternal inability to safeguard against human error. Reactors and waste systems are designed, built, and operated by men, and it does not matter how failsafe the technology claims to be, Murphy’s Law always will apply. I urge you, as responsible members of society, to write your Congressman and express your feeling of anger over a continuing pro-nuclear policy. Specifically, tell him/her to oppose S. 2189, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, which is the utilities’ answer to “solving” the waste problem. Tell your Congressman to support a moratorium on construction along with an eventual phasing out of nuclear power. This is a risk that we do not need to take.
