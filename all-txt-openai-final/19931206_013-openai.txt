An embarrassing release from the Thrill Kill Kult

“So you wanna do something that’s a little bit not too afro-centric-erotic-space-groove-jazz-funk-acid-punk?”

Tom Bavis

My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult calls their music “a psychomatik expressionism in sound and beat.” I prefer to
think of it as the kind of unlistenable, pseudo-artsy vomit that tarnishes the image of legitimate dance groups like New
Order and Nine Inch Nails. Possibly the most overly pretentious musical project since the Bee Gees’ box set, the Thrill
Kill Kult’s new album 13 Above the Night is the brainchild of singer “Groovie Mann” and musician “Buzz” McCoy.

It appears that the point of their music is to incorporate all the seedy, underworldly elements of sampling b-movies, documentaries,
and the like. Sound bites of people saying “You worship Satan!” and “I always wanted to be a movie star...”
decorate a rhythm section of keyboards, bass, and a drum machine. Sound effects—screams, police sirens, and crunchy guitar riffs in
particular—add to the sonic jumble. The beats themselves are standard house fare. Anything that strays from the 90’s dance formula
sounds more like an accident or a broken drum machine than an attempt at non-conformity. On top of all this
sound are the vocals, divided between Groovie Mann and the host of female singers in the group’s periphery. Groovie growls
and moans tunelessly throughout. Fortunately, the backing singers, nicknamed the “Bomb Gang Girlz,” are decent and make the songs nearly
tolerable.

The key to surviving the vocals is to ignore Groovie’s words, which should be a textbook example of poorly written
lyrics. “Delicate Terror” is an example of the tedious drivel that must be endured throughout: “Hypnotic mouth talks on fantasy
phone/ Sanitarium borderline/ Gone today and here tomorrow/ Killed his taste for switchblades.” Rarely has someone ever said so little
with so many words.

Compared to the few decent groups (Nine Inch Nails, Ministry) who also incorporate noise and chaos into powerful rhythms, My
Life With the Thrill Kill Kult embarrass themselves. Their sound has no focus and comes off as a pointless mishmash
of annoying sounds. The lyrics are similarly erratic, tiresomely describing places like “The Velvet Edge” and “the temple of the
Expanded Mind” but never explaining to me why I should care about them. 13 Above The Night and its creators
definitely belong somewhere far away from any decent CD collection. To quote the song “Electrical Soul Wish:” “A place beyond
shame is where we belong.”

DRUNK DRIVING DOESN'T JUST KILL DRUNK DRIVERS.

Nicholas Esposito, killed Oct. 13, 1989 at 8:25 pm.

Next time your friend insists on driving drunk, do whatever it takes to stop him. Because if he kills innocent
people, how will you live with yourself?

FRIENDS DON’T LET FRIENDS DRIVE DRUNK.

Video rentals at the Union — Feel like watching a movie but don’t want to drive to Cornelius to rent
one or don’t have a car? The game room in the Union provides a video rental within walking distance. Students
can rent movies for one dollar a night, or VCRs for two dollars a night. Monday through Thursday rentals are...Overnight
only, but Friday rentals are due by Sunday. The 125 movies available provide a range wide enough to satisfy any
mood. One can rent a Disney movie like The Little Mermaid, or a recent release such as JFK. For a
retro-80s feel, there is Flashdance, and for romantics, the rental provides Casablanca or Gone With The Wind. Die-hard fans can
rent the Star Wars trilogy or The Godfather saga. Women with a vengeance can check out Thelma and Louise for
a night of viewing pleasure.

The game room rents out approximately 3 to 4 movies a day, and there are 120 members of the rental
service. When a student rents a movie or VCR, he or she is required to sign a contract promising that
they will return it. This has to be done now because of problems in the past. “There is supposed to
be an honor code here, but people take the videos and never return them,” says Lulu Srinavasan, a game room
worker. She claims that the workers call and pester people who don’t return the videos, but some still do not
come back. Despite these problems, the video rental offers students a convenient alternative to Blockbuster. The game room is open
from 12:00-6:00 p.m. and 7:00-10:00 p.m. on weekdays, and 3:00-6:00 p.m. and 7:00-10:00 p.m. on weekends.
