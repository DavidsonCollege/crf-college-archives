CHRISTIAN ACTIVITIES

WOODROW WILSON ON THE BIBLE.

This is What President Wilson Wrote for the Testaments for The Soldiers and Sailors During the War.

“The Bible is the word of life. I beg that you will read it and find this out for yourselves—read, not little snatches here and there, but long passages that will really be the road to the heart of it. You will find it full of real men and women not only, but also of the things you have wondered about and been troubled about all your life, as men have been always; and the more you read the more it will become plain to you what things are worth while and what are not, what things make men happy—loyalty, right dealing, speaking the truth, readiness to give everything for what they think their duty, and most of all, the wish that they may have the real approval of the Christ, who gave everything for them—and the things that are guaranteed to make men unhappy—selfishness, cowardice, greed and everything that is low and mean. When you have read the Bible you will know that it is the Word of God, because you will have found it the key to your heart, your own happiness and your own duty.”

“Y” TO PUT ON CHRISTMAS PROGRAM NEXT SUNDAY

A special Christmas program will be put on at the “Y” service Sunday night. Appropriate Christmas music by the orchestra and the quartette will be one of the features. E. E. Houghton will give the story of “The Other Wise Man.” An effort will be made to hold this meeting in the church so that the town people may attend. If this effort is successful, Doctor Richards will probably give a short talk on the “Spirit of Christmas.”

MINISTERIAL BAND HEARS TALK BY H. K. RUSSELL

At the Ministerial Band Sunday, H. K. Russell gave a short talk on why he had decided to enter the ministry. He had intended to devote his life work to the study of chemistry, but in October he had thought of the opportunity for service in that occupation and in the ministry and the balance was so great in favor of the latter that he had come to realize that this was the important thing for him to do. Dealing with the main things of life in which one could perhaps use his life the best characterized the ministry.

Sunday was the regular election day and four men had been nominated by the executive committee for the president and one was nominated from the floor. McLeod was elected on the second vote. Four men from the nominating committee and one from the floor were nominated for the treasurer.

SPECIAL SERVICE HELD AT CALDWELL SUNDAY SCHOOL

Special services were conducted at the Caldwell Sunday School on last Sunday afternoon, Doctor Arbuckle being the speaker. The local “Y” quartette was present, and sang a special selection in addition to helping materially with the music as a whole. Mr. Robert E. Mell, who spoke at the college vesper service later in the evening, led the singing and gave a solo just after Doctor Arbuckle’s address. In spite of the fact that services are being held regularly at Huntersville now, the attendance at Caldwell continues good, and the teachers feel very much encouraged over the work there. This is the first service of this kind that has been held at Caldwell this fall, but plans are under way to hold one on the average of once a month during the spring.

NEW MISSION STUDY PLAN TO BE USED THIS SPRING

The mission study classes, which will take the place of Bible classes after Christmas, will follow last year’s procedure. The classes in the past have used books which were too expensive. The topics discussed were general, and as a rule, it was hard to gain interest in the classes. The classes after Christmas will study the missions of the Presbyterian Church. Each mission field with its problems will be studied according to the literature given out by the church. Free pamphlets will be furnished by the “Y” on the several missions discussed. These pamphlets will be illustrated and up-to-date, thus insuring interest in this proposition. The classes will be held every Wednesday, just as the Bible classes, and much interest is expected to be manifested.

D. MEREDITH RECEIVED INTO SOUTHERN ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES

Raleigh, N. C., Dec. 16—A telegram was received from President Charles E. Brewer on Friday, December 2, announcing that Meredith College had been received into the Southern Association of Colleges. Thus Meredith has the honor of being the only women’s college in North Carolina having membership in the association. Proper celebration of the event will take place upon Dr. Brewer’s return from Birmingham, Ala., where he is attending the convention.
