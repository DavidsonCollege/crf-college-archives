One grand business in life is not to see what lies dimly at a distance, but to do what lies clearly at hand.—Carlyle.

### THOUGHTS IN PASSING

The play, “You and I,” by Philip Barry, as presented by the Little Theatre in Charlotte last week, was most creditably done. To the lovers of this art, we suggest that they patronize these plays which will be given here by the Little Theatre.

The candlelight service presented last Sunday by members of the Woman's College of the University of North Carolina Y. W. C. A. was most impressive. A large crowd attended despite the steady downpour.

The Davidsonian wishes to take this opportunity to congratulate the newly-elected members of Phi Beta Kappa and also Omicron Delta Kappa.

The Sophomore stars, Mackorell and Wingfield, continued their splendid running in the V. M. I. game.

We were glad that “Tubby” Hand made a touchdown against V. M. I. It is seldom that a lineman, with the exception of an end, succeeds in breaking into the scoring column.

The Davidson team continued its good work against V. M. I.

The Southern Conference race has narrowed down to Auburn, Tennessee, V. P. I., and Kentucky. The defeat of Alabama at the hands of Tennessee and the tie game between Vandy and Tulane eliminated these three in all probability. Glancing over the schedules of the respective teams, it looks like Tennessee to us.

Tennessee has had splendid teams for several years but has never succeeded in having a clear claim to the title. If they can get by that Kentucky jinx this year, they might come out on top.

We believe that one benefit of the present depression is that it has made the Davidson student body as a whole a much more serious-minded group, which in itself is a good thing.

We like the idea of having deputations from girls’ colleges, and we hope that they will continue from time to time.

Citadel played Florida a very good game this last weekend, and they certainly must not be taken too lightly.

We are glad to see Home-Coming approaching. That is always a gala event for all.

Wake Forest must have an excellent line this year. So far they have not been scored on. We hope that later on this year our numerous backfield men will have some effect on this line.

### CALIFORNIA’S POLITICS

As this Presidential race draws to a close, it is intensified to a great extent as both the Democratic and Republican parties are using every instrument they can make use of to strengthen their stand. Needless to say, the states this year will probably be just as unorthodox in their voting as many were in 1928. Whereas many states normally Democratic voted the Republican ticket in that election, many in this election will in all probability go Democratic which usually go Republican.

One of these states, usually a stronghold of Republicanism, and the home of the President, is California. It will probably go Democratic, as it did for Woodrow Wilson when he was elected for the first time. The way California went in that election really turned the tide, and it may have great importance in this one also.

There are numerous reasons for the change in attitude of this far western state. One, of course, is the universal cry for a change in administration. Many believe that this depression, which has lingered so long, will immediately be lifted by a change. This is a debatable question, but nevertheless, many firmly believe that prosperity will be the immediate result if Roosevelt is elected. Others want to see a Democratic President because the Democratic platform states so much more clearly and precisely its views on the Eighteenth Amendment. Still another reason, and one which may be very decisive, is the recent statement of Senator Hiram Johnson. He said a few days ago that he could not, and would not, support Herbert Hoover in the coming election. Although Senator Johnson is by no means universally popular in California, he has a great many followers, and he has a marked influence. He is a Republican, but according to his own statement, he is a progressive one, and he feels that it is for the good of the country that we have a change in administration.

Another fact which bears up the argument that California does not favor Hoover is the defeat of Senator Shortridge for re-election to the Senate. For twelve years Shortridge has been in the Senate and has been nothing more than a rubber-stamp for most of the ultra-conservative Republican Presidents in the last few administrations. Many will argue that these signs are not true portents, but still most will agree that unless there is a radical change in the viewpoint of the people between now and election day, California will fall in line with the numerous other states, which will vote the Democratic ticket to put Franklin D. Roosevelt in the White House next March fourth.

### CHAPEL SERVICES

One of the most difficult situations for our students here on the campus at Davidson to work out or have worked out for us is the attitude of the students in chapel. It is difficult in that the chapel services have two functions. The first is primarily a religious function. Davidson, being a college which advertises itself as a Christian institution, would necessarily have to hold some kind of a daily devotional or religious service. This is taken care of by our daily chapel services, but we also use part of that time to make announcements to the student body. This, of course, is purely separated from the religious aspect and it is rather hard for some students to attain any sort of an attitude proper for a religious exercise. Practically all of us at times have been guilty of reading letters, newspapers, or studying for our next class during the chapel hour. We should attempt to put all our attention on the religious aspect first. The attitude of most students is most disconcerting to the speaker who is trying to put over a message, and it is also very discourteous. If the students will put themselves in the place of the speaker, and many of our students will speak at chapel services before the year is out, we believe that our chapel services will be greatly improved, and as a result, we will gain much more from the half an hour each morning than has been the case in the past.

### Collegiate Ramblings

**J. E. Lake**

**University of South Carolina**  
The enrollment down at the University of South Carolina has increased to 1,633 students, with the possibility of increasing to 1,800.

United States Senator Huey P. Long of Louisiana has been invited to attend the Carolina-L. S. U. game on November 5th. This is South Carolina’s Home-Coming day. Senator Long has caused quite a stir lately by his views. In the Democratic National Convention, the convention had to vote for about an hour on the question of whether he was to sit upstairs or downstairs. He sat downstairs. Quite a troublesome gentleman, but an ardent Democrat. Perhaps he is on the right side this time; well, we Democrats hope so.

**University of North Carolina**  
The Illustrated Football Magazine this year ranked Duke first in the state, 55th in the nation; University of North Carolina, second in the state, 68th in the nation; State, third in the state, 125th in the nation.

### WORLD SPECTATOR

I SAW

In Spartanburg, S. C., a radio betrayed its owner to the police, resulting in the confiscation of six gallons of whiskey. The police, after searching the home of Essie Wardlaw, were about to leave when the radio struck up the song, “How Dry I Am.” The police, out of curiosity, looked in the radio cabinet and found the contraband goods.

There will be no more hazing at Lincoln Memorial University.Night recently, some upperclassmen grabbed a young professor, and, thinking he was a Freshman, proceeded to apply the usual hazing methods. The outcome of this error is that there is now a rule against hazing. To commemorate the passing of the old system, there is a newly dug grave on the campus with an inscription on the headstone, “Here lies the Spirit of L. M. U. Born Feb. 12, 1897; Died Oct. 8, 1932.”

A rather unique business is being carried on in Dublin, Ireland. This is a rosary manufacturing company, which makes the beads and sends them to all parts of the world. In this factory are 170 working girls who elect a council and control the business of the company. Under the system of capital and labor in this particular concern, the proprietor has no more power in deciding the policy of the business than any one working girl. The employees know all the details of the business and set their own wages. It is said that the working conditions are all right, and that the concern makes a profit.

To the great joy of the Scotch Canadians, and perhaps to the sorrow of those who do not appreciate bagpipe music, the Canadian import duty on bagpipes has been lifted, provided the musical instruments are from Scotland. The duty, however, has gone up on bagpipes from other countries than Scotland. Now the Scotch pipers in Canada can strut and blow their bagpipes to their hearts’ content, feeling happy that they no longer have to pay the 15 percent import duty on the Caledonian instruments.

The sandwich men in our larger cities are a peculiar and interesting group. Many of them have been reared in cultural surroundings and have brilliant minds. Some are university graduates, while others have been high up in the professional world. But by some sad twist of fate, or some bad influence, they have lost their positions and finally land in the gutters, advertising various businesses by placards on their backs. A great many, when they reach this stage, take a turn for the better and attempt to climb back out of the gutters into their original positions, but few succeed. A great many have interesting experiences which are hard and cruel, but still they come and go, like ghosts of men.

Comparing with the burning of Brazilian coffee to raise the price, the destruction of about $11,800 worth of cultivated pearls in Kobe, Japan, took place recently when the Japanese cultivators of the pearls built a bonfire of a great many inferior jewels in front of the Chamber of Commerce building. This destruction had a two-fold aim: to get a great many pearls off the market and to raise the price, and to give some good publicity to the pearl growers.

Free wheeling is not confined to automobiles. Now in England, a locomotive has been developed which uses that coasting device, with the result that the machine uses only half the usual amount of fuel. The total cost is only three cents per mile, and out of the whole length of the locomotive’s journey, one-half the distance is done in free wheeling. The new vehicle is able to make a speed of sixty miles per hour on a level road. It is run by electricity and is used for short commuting runs.

The Von Papen government of Germany has now assumed a more centralized government by declaring the cabinet the real ruler of Germany, and giving the statement that if another Reichstag attempts to meet, it will be forced to break up by the cabinet. This means that the control of Germany is in the hands of a few men instead of the former legislature. Von Papen, in a speech expressing his plans, stated that he intended to institute a “One Neat Plan” for the reorganization of Germany’s economic condition. Von Papen will attempt to introduce some reforms, and put them in a constitution which must be ratified by the Reichstag before the cabinet will give up its control.

A Peruvian recently came to New York to visit. It had been twenty-seven years since he had been to New York, and although he had kept in contact with the metropolitan life through newspapers, magazines, and the radio, he was totally unprepared for the fast pace in which the city lived. He was puzzled by the stop lights and was afraid of all the crowds of swiftly moving automobiles. Finally, he could stand the pace no longer so he took passage on the next ship to Peru, there to rest in peace in his quiet home, and observe modern city life from a distance.

Premier Herriot has been in London, conferring with Ramsey McDonald on the question of German rearmament. He left Paris Wednesday to spend the rest of the week at the British capital. It is hoped that the two Prime Ministers will be able to formulate some plan for satisfying Germany’s desire for arms equality, and at the same time permitting France to still be confident in its freedom from invasion by Germany. There was a feeling of optimism at the meeting of the French Cabinet held just before Herriot’s departure for London. The plan had as a feature not only the equality of arms, but the calling of a convention for the discussion of complete disarmament. This is a very satisfying move, but whether it will have any effect upon the armaments of the world is not known. At least, it shows France’s desire to disarm. Many, when considering Germany’s desire for arms, have thought her very foolish for wanting to place upon her already overburdened taxpayers the added expense of an army. The other side of the question is seen when it is remembered that Germany, surrounded by armed countries, is helpless against invasion. Truly, the best solution would be, not the arming of Germany, but the disarming of the neighbors.

First place went to Southern California, second to Tulane, and third to Tennessee.

Citadel

Here is a little scheme or proposition by which you may prove that you love your girl:

Theorem—If you love a girl, she loves you.
Given—You love a girl.
To Prove—That she loves you.

Proof:
1. All the world loves a lover. (Shakespeare).
2. Your girl is all the world to you (Evident).
3. Your girl loves a lover. (Substitute 2 in 1).
4. You are a lover. (Hypothesis).

Conclusion—Therefore your girl loves you.

Now try and make a girl believe it. You’re being it, you can, and if you can’t, remember many others have failed besides you.

Wake Forest

The North Carolina Press Association will have its meeting at Wake Forest this year, on October 27-29. Wake Forest now has an enrollment of 788 students.

V. M. I.

Johnny Mackorell, flaming quarterback of our squad, has his picture in The Cadet. It is a very good likeness of this flashy Sophomore. Power to you, Johnny.

Queens-Chicora

We were very delighted to have a few of the Queens girls out to enjoy our game with W. & L., and they can rest assured that we enjoyed their company, and the game. They were high in their praise of our work against Washington and Lee.

“Care to dance?” asked Bill.

N. B. Wallace trying to wake up Joe Wadsworth Monday morning. Half of those who take the paper subscribe to be waked up in time for the first period class. N. B. says the hardest of them all to get up is Joe. As a last resort he socked Joe on the head, using the morning paper as a club. On Tuesday, even this made no impression. Joe simply rolled over.

A Freshman asked Bill Mulliss, president of the Pan-Hellenic Council, and newly-elected Phi Bete, about the dance this weekend. “Do you know how to dance?” asked Bill. “Well, I know the holds, but I don’t know the steps,” the Fresh replied.

Buck Mills carrying a football everywhere he went last week. He had one under his arm on the way to the P. O. after supper Wednesday night. Thursday morning he was seen in chapel with a football (I guess it was the same one).

A Senior found a box of cigars in Hartman Eager’s room, smoked one and left the others alone. Who said there is no such thing as honesty!

Kenneth Weeks and Gus Maynard coming up from the student store just before bedtime. Kenneth was telling Gus about a man he knew who married a girl on his deathbed, so she could have his millions when he was gone. He asked Gus if he thought he could love a girl like that. Gus exclaimed, “That’s the kind of a girl I could love. What’s her telephone number?”

Mrs. N. T. Smith, our dormitory supervisor and good friend, having a confab with some friends at one of Charlotte’s swankiest restaurants one day last week.

A Fresh bumming to Charlotte for a date with a telephone operator with a line that would catch anybody. He claims that she is connected with the best Charlotte families. Number please!

A goodly delegation from Davidson on hand to greet the Boswell Sisters Saturday afternoon as they passed through Charlotte on the train.

A Soph wrote down the things somebody called his roommate. They were such expressions as: bombastic mutt, windjammer nonentity, false alarm, ad infinitum. He has them for reference so he can use them on him the next time they have a “Battle of Words.”

Now you just try and keep from reading this column next week. I’m going to announce something that will interest everybody. Well, goodbye and take care of yourself.
