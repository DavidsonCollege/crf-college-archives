THE DAVIDSONIAN, FEBRUARY 6, 1930

Football Team Honored At Elaborate Banquet

Gaston County Alumni Entertained Players and Coaches Last Thursday Night

Davidson College alumni in Gaston County gave an elaborate banquet to the football team of Davidson last Thursday at the
Masonic Temple in Gastonia, approximately 45 people being in attendance. Only three cars of Davidson representatives could be there, due
both to classroom work for some, and inclement weather for others. It was declared by practically everyone from Davidson to
be one of the best affairs they had ever attended.

Fred L. Smyre, 1900, of Gastonia, president of the Gaston County Alumni Association, presided at the banquet, and after several
delicious courses had been served he introduced Hugh A. Query, ’09, editor of The Gastonia Gazette, who formally extended a
welcome to the team, coaches, and visitors. Numerous people were called upon for short talks during the evening, including F.
L. Jackson, treasurer of the college; W. L. Younger, coach; Jos. B. Johnston, '01, president of Barium Springs Orphanage; Ralph
McMillan, '26, athletic coach at Barium; Ernest Milton, alumni secretary; Thad Brock, 1929 captain of the team; William Sparrow, '27;
R. D. Hall, '19; Rev. R. J. Hunter, '93; Rev. T. G. Tate, '10; D. R. LaFar, '22; Sam A.
Robinson, '99; Coit M. Robinson, '10; Dr. R. E. Rhyne, ’08, and J. Lee Robinson, a trustee.

One of the features of the affair was an impromptu comedy skit by three of the football players, Joe McCall,
Hub Covington, and Bill Mason. They had not prepared to give a rendition of their act, but obliged the insistent
people.

At the conclusion of the meeting, officers for the coming year were chosen. The nominating committee of LaFar, Query, and
Sparrow brought in the names of R. D. Hall, of Belmont, ’19, for president, and W. T. Spencer, ’26, of
Gastonia, for secretary-treasurer. These men were unanimously elected.

The theme of the entire meeting was the success which the Davidson team and coaches had enjoyed during the 1929
season, but the trend of thought deviated, and splendid suggestions were made by different individuals as to what the alumni
could do to aid the institution they graduated from.

PUNCTUATE YOUR DAY WITH CAMELS

Let Camels be the commas and periods in the page of your daily activity. Each Camel is a little interlude,
a high-spot of pleasure with which to punctuate your changing moods and thoughts. It adds so much to the pleasure
of life to pause now and then and say to yourself, "Time out for a Camel!" In Camel, you get
that extra measure of pleasure because Camels are expertly blended from the choicest tobaccos grown. Mild and mellow, cool and
refreshing, their fragrance is always pleasant, indoors and out, and they do not tire the taste nor leave an after-taste.
