#### Frisbee golf: disc fun without the sweating

**KATHRYN WYLE**

With the shouts of “owned!!!” resounding from Chambers lawn and legions of “Davidson Ultimate” hoodies confronting you wherever you turn,
it’s hard to miss the Frisbee presence on this campus.

But do you realize, gentle reader, that there is more to this phenomenon than the minions of DUFF? Perhaps you’ve
played a game of pickup Ultimate in your day, or been a recipient of the famous DUFF emailing, but have
you yet discovered the joys of disc golf?

You’ve seen them teeing off as you walked down to your frat or eating house for meals; maybe you have
even unwillingly joined in their game, when that poorly aimed hammer-throw whizzed just past your ear.

As the weather grows increasingly lovely and your work ethic grows increasingly threadbare, take the time to go play a
round with friends and see for yourself what the differences between a putter and a driver are, or why there
is underwear hanging in a tree along the course.

Disc golf began about 30 years ago when a bright soul named Ed Headrick realized that Ultimate Frisbee involved far
too much running, not to mention coordination of large groups of people.

With disc golf you need neither a pentathlete’s body nor a sorority girl’s bevy of friends (though both are certainly
with their merits, should you have them). In its most pure form, disc golf is an internal battle, a challenge
between (wo)man and disc.

In its less pure—though no less enjoyable—forms, it can also involve friends, pets, coolers, and copious bushwhacking to recover lost
discs. The aim of disc golf is really quite simple.

Davidson’s campus harbors not one but two courses: the first begins on Patterson Court between SigEp and Fiji, continues out
behind satellite before looping back and concluding by Commons. The second, less well-known course is hidden at the lake campus.

It bears mentioning in all of this that not all discs are alike.

One very easy way to betray your ignorance is to confuse the equipment of Ultimate Frisbee with the titular tool
of Disc Golf.

Regulation Ultimate Frisbees are larger, lighter, shaped differently, and hold far more strawberry milk. Disc golf Frisbees are small, heavy,
and come in putters, drivers, and midrange.

Both, however, can be found for hire at Davidson Outdoors.

Just as golfers take great pride in the titanium-aluminum core nine iron, serious Disc golfers are similarly finicky about their
Frisbees.

Discs vary in stability and the type of plastic, whether they “float” or not; you can even order discs painted
in colors that show under ultraviolet light. Though it is by nature a simple, relatively unencumbering sport, the true enthusiast
can amass quite a collection of paraphernalia and debate the merits of Wham-o to Discraft.

I was initially chagrined to discover that disc golf courses do not generally involve windmills, miniature castles, or animatronic pirates.
Instead, the targets are, in effect, large chain baskets on poles.

Admittedly, these lack some of the exotic charm of your standard putt-putt course, or the groomed country club sophistication of
the PGA. But disc golf fills a different niche, I would argue, placing the player in a more naturalistic setting
far from commercialization or kitsch where the sweet rattling of chains mingles with birdsong.

So if you are stuck on campus over a break (which begs the question, “Why aren’t you paddling to Capers
Island or hiking in the Smokies?”) take advantage of a nice day and celebrate your freedom from work by throwing
a small plastic disc at large metal poles.
