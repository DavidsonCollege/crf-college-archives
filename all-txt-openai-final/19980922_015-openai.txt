THE DAVIDSONIAN — SPORTS — Tuesday, September 22, 1998

MY DEGREE GOT ME THE INTERVIEW.
ARMY ROTC GOT ME THE JOB.

Things got pretty competitive for this job. I’m sure my college degree and good grades kept me in the running.
But in the end, it was the leadership and management experience I got through Army ROTC that won them over.
Army ROTC taught me responsibility, self-discipline, and leadership. Those are things you just can't learn from a textbook. I don't
know where I'd be right now if I hadn't enrolled in Army ROTC, but I do know one thing for
sure ... I wouldn't be here.
