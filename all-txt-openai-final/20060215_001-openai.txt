Cingular proposes
tower for campus

By KATIE PFEIFFER
Senior Staff Writer

Cingular Wireless has proposed
building a tower on campus to pro-
vide better cell phone service to
Davidson students and town resi-
dents.

The College is in the preliminary
planning stages and does not yet
have a time frame for decisions
regarding the proposal.

Many students are frustrated by
the limited cell phone service on
campus.

“One of my great friends, J.P.,
could not make a call for four years
because there was no Cingular
tower on campus,” said Christian
Davis ’06. “I know it greatly
affected his social life.”

Currently, reliable cell phone
service on campus and around
town is limited.

Many students use Verizon
Wireless, owing to the fact that a
Verizon antenna was placed on the
roof of the library two years ago.

While the Verizon antenna was a
good fix for local campus use, such
a strategy is not necessarily appli-
cable to other companies.

The Cingular tower would bene-
fit not only the College, but also
the town.

Although the tower was original-
ly planned to be placed in the town,
it is now being considered for sev-
eral locations on campus.

The most feasible option is to
replace one of the light posts on the
IMAC fields with the tower and
then to hang lights for the fields
from the tower.

Students who have been forced
to switch cell phone services while

CoHo to close
next semester

By: JILLIAN BARTELS
Staff Writer

CoHo, Patterson Court’s only
co-ed eating house, will close at the
end of the semester due to lack of
membership.

Although house members are
upset about the closing, president
Tammy Ivins said they have no
other option. Their low member-
ship has made it financially impos-
sible to keep the house running.

The organization was founded in
2000 and now has 13 members.
Approximately half of their mem-
bers will be graduating this semes-
ter. While the house could continue

as a recognized Davidson College
organization, the lack of members
would make a decision to keep the
house open cost-ineffective.

Former CoHo president Aubrey
Groves ’06 said that “the board bills
would be exorbitantly high and the
manpower would be bare mini-
mum.”

CoHo experienced financial
problems in spring 2005, leading
them to drop their meal plan and
become a social house during the
fall.

The members said that they
wanted to devote fall semester to

First-years to get credit
for ‘Assassins’ game

By COLLEEN McKown
Senior Staff Writer

The game Assassins, a mock
combat game played with water
guns, has recently been approved
as a Physical Education (PE) life-
time credit. The game is for fresh-
men only and will start in March.

Hall counselor Emmanuel Jose
’06 proposed the idea to the PE
department after talking with some
freshmen on his hall.

“My freshmen residents had
asked if it would be possible to get
PE credit for playing Assassins
since this year’s game involves

physical, mental and endurance
challenges that active players can
compete in to advance further in
the game,” Jose said.

Jose worked with the Union
Board and Davidson Outdoors to
create the challenges, which are
being finalized this week. Physical
challenges will take place on the
climbing wall in Davidson
Outdoors and in the pool at Baker
Sports Complex.

According to Senior Women’s
Compliance Director Katy McNay,
who works with the PE depart-

Farmer
to speak on
healthcare

By EMILY KOTA
Senior Staff Writer

Dr. Paul Farmer will be speaking
in the Duke Family Performance
Hall on February 19 at 7 p.m.

Farmer, a humanitarian physi-
cian, is expected to focus on his
work providing healthcare in limit-
ed settings through community-
based efforts.

Farmer is an infectious disease
physician who advocates improved
healthcare in developing nations.

He is the founding director of the
international organization Partners
in Health (PIH).

PIH aims, according to their
website, “to bring the benefits of
modern medical science to those
most in need of them and to serve
as an antidote to despair.”

The organization is active on
four continents, and it has pro-
grams in seven countries, including
Haiti, Guatemala, Rwanda,
Mexico, Peru, Russia and the
United States.

PIH’s work stems from the belief
that everyone, independent of eco-
nomic status, deserves high quality
medical care.

“Partners in Health makes treat-
ment very community-based
through directly observed therapy,”
Professor of Biology David
Wessner said.

Trained local community mem-
bers help ensure that long-term
treatment regimens for infectious
diseases such as HIV, AIDS and
