**Proposes $50,000 For Dorms**

By GRAY WILSON  
Managing Editor

Faced with the destruction of the College Union, the Residence Hall Council (RHC), spearheaded by president Bill Alexander, has approached the administration with proposals to equip the dormitories with massive kitchen and recreational facilities.

“This has climaxed everything I've been working for in RHC because I think dorm improvement should be the main objective of every RHC president,” Alexander said.

The proposals were submitted in a general meeting of the RHC with Director of Student Housing Scotty Nicholls, Dean of Students Will H. Terry, and college Business Manager Robert A. Currie.

The recommendations include the following:
1) A recreation room in each residence hall which would contain full kitchen facilities (stove, refrigerator, cooking utensils), ironing facilities, an ice machine (similar to the one already in Belk dorm), and such items as pinball machines, etc.;
2) Carpeting for all dorms, beginning this summer with Belk, Little, and one other dorm (this includes rooms eventually, but the halls are to be carpeted first);
3) Bulletin boards for each freshman hall for announcements to be posted;
4) Ping pong tables for each dorm located in an adjacent area outside each building (as say, the patio of Belk).

Considering the cost of the facilities (an ice machine alone runs approximately $800) as well as the space that must be given up for the rooms, the loss in revenue for the college will be about $50,000.

Alexander emphasized that the timing this year was perfect in view of the demise of the union. “The administration has felt that it had finished renovation of the dorms this year, but its response to the proposals has been particularly good because these new dorm facilities will help take up the slack left by the vanishing role of the union.”

Both Terry and Nicholls expressed their support for the proposals. “I'd like to see it done,” said Nicholls. “Our dorms have always been deficient in common use area, and nothing would improve residence hall life more than these facilities.”

**King Kong, Other Classics To Highlight “Film Nut”**

By ROBERT TOUCHTON  
Asst. Managing Editor

If you didn’t pay to see King Kong when you went home for Thanksgiving because your girlfriend wanted to see Love Story again—you’re in for luck Sunday night.

The original, uncut version of the big man's story is showing in Love Auditorium at 9 p.m. and will actually be free.

Doug Lemza, a graduate of Wake Forest, a representative of Films, Inc., a “film nut” (according to Shaw Smith), and a friend of Davidson College, is spending a portion of his vacation on campus talking to other “film nuts” such as Bobby Allen and Jon Jewett.

And, fortunately for all Davidson students, he’s bringing six nice films with him for public showing, courtesy of Films, Inc., a film rental firm.

Sunday night a double feature will play in The Entertainment Center of the South. Preceding the 9 p.m. King Kong, Where East is East, a 1929 silent classic, will begin at 7 p.m. The first flick was directed by Tod Browning and features the original Lon Chaney. It is described as “hypnotic and perverse,” at least by 1929 standards.

Monday afternoon at 3 p.m., The Big Parade, a silent anti-war movie, will play in Love Auditorium. It was filmed in 1925. That night at 8 p.m., Diary of a Chambermaid, vintage 1966, will be shown. Tuesday at 7 p.m., a “mystery film,” selected by Lemza from a list of five movie classics, will light the big screen in Love. According to Jewett, it will probably be a musical.

The second half of the Tuesday night double feature will be the 1941 The Magnificent Ambersons, considered Orson Welles’ second best film, ranking behind only Citizen Kane.

While at Wake Forest, Lemza created a film program like that college had never had before, a program rated as one of the best in the country. After graduation, Films, Inc. quickly picked him up.

Lemza knows the history of innumerable movies and stories about films and film nuts. Discussion sessions will be announced at the showing of the films, probably to meet in the Union Bar. Coffee will be provided; any other beverage should be brought.

If the college were to rent these six movies, the cost would probably be $500 or more, according to Smith and Jewett. In addition, Lemza may bring an extra movie for showing.

The special showings are an extension of the Union film programs, this year being directed by Robin Gray and Jewett.

**CAPRICORN,**

**Dec. 22-Jan. 19**

Capricorn, the Goat, never defies conventions. And that's why you've got to take it easy with Schlitz Malt Liquor... & Taurus, the Bull.

Because The Bull ain't conventional—it’s a unique drink with dynamic good taste.

Even though you present a no-nonsense, disciplined exterior to the world, you've actually got a very gentle soul—romantic and poetic. But you keep this submerged and only a chosen few know the real you.

You tend to be a social climber—you admire prestige and success. And when you get together with these kinds of people, you ask for Schlitz Malt Liquor, because you know they're bound to be impressed with your discrimination and good taste.

But just remember, you're shy. And the Bull isn't. So be wary when you take on the Bull. It may take some adjusting, but you and Schlitz Malt Liquor can be friends.

Nobody makes malt liquor like Schlitz. Nobody.
