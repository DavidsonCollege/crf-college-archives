Santa brings the men's basketball team a great present
By Will Cobb

Davidson’s men’s basketball program captured their first victory over an ACC opponent in over a decade when they defeated Clemson
University in the Charlotte Coliseum during exams last semester. The success has continued as the Wildcats went on to upset
NC State and East Tennessee State on the road. Along with the big wins have come a couple of tough
losses as well to schools such as The Citadel and Marshall. Still, Davidson has proved that this year’s squad is
a serious contender for the Southern Conference title, with a probable trip to postseason play if the current success continues.
The overall record now stands at 10-5 (4-4 Southern Conference, 2-1 ACC).

Davidson 82 Clemson 79:
After running out to a 13-point halftime lead, the Cats held off a late surge from the Tigers to preserve
the victory. Sophomore Brandon Williams had a career-best 28 points, hitting 5 of 8 attempts from the three-point line while
leading the team with 6 rebounds. Another great performance included senior Jason Zimmerman, who hit 6 of 12 shots, including
5 three-pointers, finishing with 21. With the Wildcats having a height disadvantage, they shot from the outside, sinking 14 three-pointers
as opposed to 12 regular field goals.

Marshall 75 Davidson 71:
The three-game win streak came to a halt at the hands of the Thundering Herd in Davidson’s first game in
11 days. After falling behind by 10 at the half, the Cats came back to take the lead with 7:19
remaining. But following two consecutive Davidson timeouts, Marshall put the game out of reach, holding on for the upset. Williams
led the team with 20 points. Just as the Cats beat Clemson with great 3-point shooting, the team shot only
22% from the 3-point line in the loss.

Davidson 64 NC State 63:
Davidson came ready to play and the sharpshooting Janko Narat buried the Wolfpack by hitting 7 of 10 field goal
attempts while hitting all nine free throws for a game-high 24 points. Chris Alpert protected the ball well while gathering
12 points and Jason Zimmerman put forth an excellent defensive effort, leading the team with 8 rebounds.

Davidson 68 Western Carolina 64:
For the second game in a row, Narat led the Cats to victory with 24 points. George Spain added 18
points and Brandon Williams gathered up a game-high 13 rebounds while scoring 8 points. Davidson jumped out to a big
lead but was not able to put the Catamounts away.

Swimming finishes third in meet with national programs
By David Dwyer

Davidson’s Swimming and Diving teams faced an uphill battle Saturday afternoon in facing Georgia Southern and UNC-Wilmington. In many of
the swimming events, Davidson swimmers found themselves outnumbered by a heavy margin, often competing against three or four members of
each opposing team. Because swimming and diving are basically individual competitions, one might think that the number of participants isn’t
significant — but in this case, it is, because it indicates the size of the resources from which GS and
UNC-W could draw. Still, Davidson performed admirably, notching at least a top-five finish in almost all of the events they
entered.

Leading the Davidson charge was, as usual, sophomore Churchill Hooff, who finished first in both the men’s 500 and 1000M
freestyle and third in the 200M individual medley. Freshman Michael Hart stood out as Davidson’s top performer in the men’s
1M and 3M diving, finishing second in both categories. On the women’s side, freshman Suzanne Herring finished second and first
in the women’s 100 and 200M freestyle, respectively. Sophomore Meg Bentley took third place in the 3M diving competition to
lead her teammates. The women’s relay team also made a significant contribution, earning second and third places in the 400M
medley and the 400M freestyle.

Overall, both Davidson teams finished third of the meet’s three contestants, though the margins of defeat weren’t great: Davidson’s men
lost toGeorgia Southern by only 19 points and by 33 to UNCW, who finished first overall. Saturday’s meet was a
challenge of the upstart versus the established, and this time the upstart fell just a bit short.

I love ACC basketball. For those of you who don’t know me, I am a die-hard Georgia Tech fan. Being
a Yellow Jacket makes it often difficult to live in Tar Heel and Blue Devil country. I have watched some
of the most thrilling ACC battles from Alexander Memorial Coliseum (“The Thrillerdome”). I have watched a last-second win over Duke
in 1993 and a convincing 1994 victory over UNC (a great way to bring in the New Year, I might
add). I have also seen, however, the Jackets completely destroyed by these two teams as well as other members of
the ACC.

Conference battles in the ACC are the most intense in college basketball. Can any college conference even come close to
ACC-type conference competition? No team is ever safe in the ACC. No conference game is ever easy. The ACC is
full of talented players and coaches. I have never seen a center as strong as Eric Montross. He looks like
a tree that has staked his position in the ground and seems to say, “Excuse me while I reach over
your head and dunk this basketball.” Joe Smith, the phenomenal freshman center/forward from the University of Maryland, gets my vote
for freshman of the year. He is second in the ACC in the scoring department, averaging 22.3 points a game.

The ACC has had and still has some of the most amazing guards. Kenny Anderson and Bobby Hurley are two
that come to mind because of their assisting and scoring abilities. (By the way, I wish Bobby Hurley the quickest
possible recovery). Randolph Childress, the guard from Wake Forest, whose scoring ability helped defeat Duke last week, is leading the
ACC in scoring, averaging 22.7 points a game. I cannot fail to mention Mr. Versatility himself, Grant Hill. He complements
an amazing Duke starting line-up.

No one can argue against the fact that the ACC has some of the best coaches. Dean Smith—no explanation is
necessary. In my opinion, he is one of the best ever. Coach K has also done extremely well at Duke
(No offense Duke fans, but I am not even going to attempt to spell his last name). Coach K has
a 405-177 record at Duke with 2 National Championships. To this elite few, I must add Georgia Tech’s Bobby Cremins.
He’s not as good as Dean Smith or Mike K..., but he is just so likable.

The ACC is definitely the strongest basketball conference. In the 93-94 preseason rankings, 4 ACC teams were ranked in the
top 25. The ACC tops the list of conferences with the most NBA players. The University of North Carolina has
the most active NBA players with 11, followed by Arkansas and then two more ACC teams: N.C. State with 9
and Georgia Tech with 8.

I love ACC basketball. March just would not be the same without the Atlantic Coast Conference. And, let’s not forget
that our own Davidson Wildcats posted two important victories over Clemson and N.C. State and lost a close one to
Wake Forest. Way to go guys. We have a near-perfect record against the toughest conference in basketball.

**Correction**

Before Christmas, The Davidsonian ran a feature story which incorrectly reported that senior Garnett Smith is a music major. Instead,
Smith is forming a self-designed major in choral conducting through the Center for Interdisciplinary Studies. The editors regret this mistake
and wish to apologize.
