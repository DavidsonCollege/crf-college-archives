| DIAMOND DUST | “Murray, of the State College, and Clarke, of Davidson, are without doubt two of the best college heavers in North Carolina this season. In the same class, however, are Southard, of Trinity, and Powell, of the University. Any college team with these four twirlers would lose only a few games in four years' time.” — News and Observer.

The winning run in the first A. & E. game was made with the bases full when the ball hit the bat of a Davidson man as he attempted to dodge and the ball rolled fair.

* * *

Ratchford on second is continuing to play a good steady fielding and hitting game and is mentioned in practically all of the newspaper accounts of the games.

It is reported that Clarke has received telegrams with offers from the Baltimore Club.

Practically all of this year's team will be back next year. We will greatly miss Miller and Clarke in the line-up.

SECOND GAME.
Both teams were decidedly weakened by the hard work of the day before and the game was very loosely played. Burrus, the invincible southpaw who recently held Davidson to one safety, was again on the job, and although poorly supported, kept his hits sufficiently scattered to stay in the lead. Currie was hit hard and often and was not given the proper support. The Presbyterians had ample opportunity to score but inability to hit at the proper time allowed ten men to perish on the sacks. The lucky seventh was the only inning in which the timely hit was produced when it counted. Pressley dropped Ratchford’s fly to left field. Johnston and Currie were unable to connect. Spann walked. Miller drove one to the bank, bringing Ratchford in and landing Spann at third. Cassell followed with another clout for half the circuit, bringing Spann and Miller across. W. Johnson, the Tech catcher, wielded a hefty stick, poling out two doubles and one single out of four appearances at the plate.

Very few details have been learned of the defeat handed out by Trinity Thursday afternoon. Miley was in the box for the Wildcats but the hard-hitting Methodists were a little too much for his delivery and the final count gave them the decision by a 6-2 score.
