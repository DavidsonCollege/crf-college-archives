**Wildcats split in soccer games last week**

By PERRY MATHEWES

The Davidson soccer team split their two games this week to bring their record to 5-12-1. Saturday, in a rainy game, they fell 6-1 to UNCC, then won at The Citadel 3-2 Wednesday night.

In the UNCC game, the two teams played fairly evenly but UNCC made their shots count, scoring three goals on four shots in the first half. Davidson, however, missed many of their opportunities. Davidson’s goal came in the first half. A long pass from senior forward Brian Shockley found junior midfielder Chip Wittmann who tipped the ball over to junior forward Craig Mattison. Mattison’s volley then found the back of the net.

The team was hurt by the absence of junior sweeper Michael Spear. Spear has been a steady player for several years and the team does not have a backup sweeper. With Spear out due to an injury, freshman Rob Vest was moved back, but his inexperience at that position showed.

The Citadel game went much better for the Wildcats. Just four minutes into the game, Shockley headed the ball in for a goal to give Davidson the lead. Mattison was credited with the assist. After the quick goal, however, the team lost some of their intensity and allowed The Citadel to equalize. The score was 1-1.

The Cats came out in the second half with a much different attitude. Playing with more intensity, they dominated the rest of the game. Senior fullback Steve Stith made a long cross that beat the defense to find freshman forward Jim Walker, who scored with his left foot. Spear scored Davidson’s last goal on a penalty kick when sophomore forward Mike Friedlander was tripped in the penalty box with four minutes left in the game. Davidson again eased up and allowed The Citadel to narrow the margin a minute later on a defensive error.

Coach Charlie Slagle was pleased with the win. Davidson clinched third place in the Southern Conference with a 3-2 record. “Motivation is tough since we didn’t reach our goals of the season, to win the conference and to break .500,” Slagle said.

Davidson will host Richmond tomorrow at 2 p.m. then Akron, the number six team in the nation, Sunday at 1 p.m. “Richmond is a pretty team to watch, they one-touch the ball a lot, but they have had trouble scoring this year. Hopefully we’ll give them a good game,” Slagle said. Akron will be much tougher, but an enjoyable team to see. This will be Davidson’s last game of the season.

**Field hockey has high hopes for next season**

The Davidson women’s field hockey team concluded their season last weekend at the Deep South Tournament at Catawba College. Although the team was winless for the weekend, there were some fine performances individually and as a team.

Davidson was unfortunately seeded last among the college teams which meant a tough early schedule in the tournament. On Friday, the Cats started off with the number two seed among the college teams, Pfeiffer. The Cats played well but fell short in a 1-0 loss.

In the next game, later that afternoon, Davidson faced High Point. They played well but fatigue set in quickly. Sophomore Suzanne Mauze and senior captain Heather McKee helped the Cats’ cause with goals, but it was not enough as Davidson fell 3-2.

On Saturday, the team faced a fine Carolina Club team, and responded to the challenge with their strongest game of the weekend. Unfortunately, they could not score and Carolina escaped with a 1-0 victory on the strength of a second half goal.

Sunday, Davidson lost to the Durham club team by a 4-0 tally. On the individual level, several Davidson players were selected to one of the Deep South all-star teams. Senior Heather McKee missed Big South for the first time in her career.First time in her career, but was selected to the Big South 2 team. Junior Mandy Barrett, Mauze, and freshman Marta Bukowski were all first-time selections to the Big South 3 team. These teams will practice this weekend in preparation for the Southeast tournament at the University of Richmond starting Nov. 15.

Sophomore Mike Friedlander vies for the header. The team finished the regular season with a 1-2-1 record. The loss of McKee, Davidson's strongest player for each of the last four years, along with goalie Nana Lay and midfielder Polly Northen, will leave some big gaps to be filled next season, but overall, the team is very young. In assessing the season, Bukowski said, “We had a new coach and lots of inexperience. We really came together at the end, which is good motivation for next year.” Freshman Christi Sloane said, “We seemed to get better and better, we did everything but score. It was hard for the seniors, but we’re all very positive about next year.” McKee, the team’s leading scorer on the season, agreed. “I felt we improved a lot over the season. We became more of a team and people's individual skills improved as well.” Despite vast gains in the areas of experience and skills, the team will miss McKee’s steady play of the last four seasons. Possibly the best field hockey player in the history of Davidson, McKee has received All-Deep South honors in each of her four years. Even more impressive was her selection to the Olympic trials in the spring of 1984.

Cross country places well in Conference match

The men’s and women’s cross country teams became the first of Davidson’s teams to end their Southern Conference association when they ran in the SC championships for the final time Saturday. The men ran to a seventh-place finish and the women placed fifth in a field of seven teams. Senior Greg Foreman led the men’s team with a fine time of, erry ge we, for the season by 26 seconds. The time was the best for any Davidson runner this season. He was followed by junior Chris Fisher. Freshman Jay Clugston ran his best time as a Wildcat to place third. Senior Emil Cekada and sophomore Bill Hartman rounded out the scoring. The men placed in front of Western Carolina and The Citadel in the standings. The defeat of The Citadel marked an improvement over last season when the team beat only Western in an eighth-place showing.

For the women, the Southern Conference was unquestionably their best race of the season. Five of the seven women running for Davidson posted their best times of the year. Junior Laura Fannin led the Cats with a time of 20:28, topping her previous best effort by 1:06. Classmate Morrow Reeves also ran a fine race, posting a 20:36, her best of the season by 1:07. Freshman Lisa Culbertson posted her best time of the season to finish third, as did junior Karen Kemerait en route to the fifth spot on the team. Freshman Missy Willis came in fourth for the women. The women’s team finished ahead of Western Carolina and Furman. The defeat of Furman was especially gratifying since the Paladins had beaten Davidson earlier in the season. Coach Gary Andrew said of the race, “I was thrilled with the way the girls ran. It was by far their best effort of the season.” “Looking back to where we started, I feel very positive about the season so far. We’ve progressed a lot. Everything has gone really well,” Andrew said. Both teams have a week off in preparation for the NCAA Region III meet at Furman on Nov. 15. The race will give the Cats a chance to run against some of the best teams in the country and should provide a good conclusion.
