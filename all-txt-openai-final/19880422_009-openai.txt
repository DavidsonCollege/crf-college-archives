**Trustees plan to reevaluate football program in two years**

**Board seeks to allow Gatto time to firmly establish his program**

By BRUCE NEWSOME

Recently, rumors have circulated around campus concerning the future of the Davidson football program. In an interview on Monday, April
18, Athletic Director Christopher B. “Kit” Morris explained the situation.

The Board of Trustees has decided to review the program over the next two years. At the end of these
two years, they will evaluate the program and decide whether Davidson should continue its commitment to play Division I-AA football
in the Colonial League, drop to Division III, or drop the football program entirely.

The school can drop the football team to Division III without declassifying its other sports. Morris pointed out that at
present, the school is dedicated to fulfilling its commitment to upgrading the football program and competing in the Colonial League.

The Board will look closely at the team’s performance against league foes over the next two years. As a result
of a lackluster recruiting effort by former coach Farrell in his last two years at Davidson and Coach Vic Gatto’s
late start on recruiting when he arrived in the spring of 1985, the Cats have played with mostly freshmen and
sophomores in the last two years.

However, by the 1989 season, Gatto will have four recruiting classes, and Davidson should be evenly matched with other Colonial
League schools in age and physical maturity.

Since the Board has set up a two-year review, Gatto will have had enough time to firmly establish the program.

After the 1989 season, the Board will look at Davidson’s performance against Colonial League competition and decide what course the
Davidson football program will follow into the 1990s.
