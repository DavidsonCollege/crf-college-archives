Men's Track Shines At Clemson, Pembroke St.
By Peter Hurtado

Continuing a season which promises to see many records fall, the men’s track and field team returned from meets at
Clemson and Pembroke State this weekend with one school record and several promising performances.

At the Clemson Relays on Friday, the 4x1500m relay squad of Captain Ted Richardson, Cam Dauler, David Kerns, and Peter
Hurtado set a new school record of 16:43.8, placing 2nd overall. Richardson led the way for the ‘Cats with a
sensational opening leg of 4:05.6. Strong performances by Dauler (4:15) and Kerns (4:16) kept the ‘Cats near the lead, before
Hurtado (4:05.7) rallied Davidson to the record. The fallen record was set in 1988.

Senior John Moss, having a stellar track season, conquered the 3000m Steeplechase in a phenomenal time of 9:47.6 to place
3rd at Clemson. Moss is now Davidson’s 3rd best Steeplechaser ever. In the 400 hurdles, freshmen Duncan Spears (58.6) and
David Stewart (58.9) continued their successful seasons.

On Saturday at Clemson, the Distance Medley Relay squad made a run at a 26-year-old record, but came up 9
seconds short. Cam Dauler led off with a super 800m of 2:00.8. The baton then fell into the hands of
Duncan Spears, who rocketed to a 400m of 50.6. Peter Hurtado put in a 1200m of 3:14.4, and then watched
as teammate Ted Richardson flew his way to a 4:25.5 mile and 3rd place overall. The ‘Cats’ time of 10:31.2
is the 3rd best time ever at Davidson.

At the Braves Track Classic at Pembroke St. on Saturday, freshman Richard Wharton took the lead after one lap and
never looked back as he won the 3000m Steeplechase in a personal best time of 10:43. Other notable performances for
the ‘Cats included a long jump of 20’ 6" by D.J. Ruggles, who placed 6th. In the javelin, Captain Paul
Levengood placed 4th at 147'11". Mike Grant put in a quick 800m of 2:06.2 for the Wildcats. Steve Waters led
the way for the ‘Cats in the Discus, placing 3rd at 115’ 3 1/2". Rafael Candelario and Rob King swept
5th and 6th places, respectively, in both the shot-put and discus. This season is the finest in several years for
these field events. No record is safe from falling this season, as this year’s Wildcats are strong in almost every
event. Stay tuned, as this year’s squad takes Captain Ted Richardson’s words to heart: “Let’s rewrite ‘em, ‘Cats!”

Coastal Scares Indiana, Hoyas Top Vandy In NCAA Tourney
By Bruce Balestier

Indiana 79 - Coastal Carolina 69

After defeating Davidson in the semifinals of the Big South Tournament, the Chanticleers of Coastal Carolina took the title with
a 35-point blowout of Augusta, and then advanced to the NCAA Tournament with a victory over Jackson State of the
Southwest Athletic Conference (SWAC) in the play-in game to the Tournament. Seeded 15th in the Southeast Region by the NCAA,
the Chants drew #2 seed (and #3 in the country) Indiana.

Thursday evening’s matchup with the Hoosiers was close early on, but a surge by Indiana late in the first half
gave them a comfortable 46-30 halftime lead, and the game seemed destined to end up a blowout. But before 18,000
screaming fans in Louisville (most pulling for Indiana) and a national TV audience, Coastal fought back. The shooting of senior
Brian Penny (13-15 from the field, 5-6 from 3-point land), who scored 25 of his 34 in the second half,
helped Coastal to gradually pare away the Indiana lead. Their comeback reached its height when they trailed just 66-63, and
had the ball, with 2:34 to play. From there, though, the Hoosiers did what they had to do; Damon Bailey
hit a 3-pointer to make it 69-63, and they made their free throws in the final minutes to account for
the 79-69 final score. Said legendary Indiana coach Bob Knight, “I told you Coastal was a very good basketball team.”
The Chants finished 24-8.

Tarpley Still Reigns
By Peter Hurtado

The women’s track and field team, as promised, once again delivered in meets at Clemson and Pembroke St. this Saturday.
They returned with 3 new school records and an exciting relay performance.

At the Clemson Relays, Heather Tarpley continued her domination of the 400 hurdles. Heather’s time of 67.3 in the trials
on Friday broke her own record set only a week ago. Tarpley promptly set the record again on Saturday with
a 67.2 clocking. Heather also broke her own standard in the discus with a throw of 122'9".

Co-Captain Kathy Beach reeled off consistent splits, as she broke her own record in the 5000m run in a time
of 18:20.5. Beach placed 5th overall. In the Distance Medley Relay, the women ran their way to a fine time
of 12:43.6, but were disqualified by a hand-off foul. Lisa Sitek opened with an outstanding 800m of 2:33. Heather Tarpley
then blazed a 62.3 400m, handing off to Karen Marshall, who passed several runners and covered 1200m in 3:52.6. Kathy
Beach pulled the ‘Cats in with a strong final mile.

At the Braves Track Classic at Pembroke St., senior Laurie Reams placed 3rd in the 1500 with a time of
5:29.2. Freshman Jennifer Humphrey improved her 400m time with a 69.4 performance. The depth displayed in the relay andIn other
areas for the women, this could translate to additional records later this season. Don’t miss the action.

Georgetown 70 - Vanderbilt 60. Davidson transfer Bruce Elder’s Commodores, seeded 9th in the West region, fell Friday night in
Tucson to 8th-seeded Georgetown, in a game for the dubious privilege of playing #1 UNLV in the 2nd round. After
trailing 35-25 at the half, the ‘Dorés fought back to take the lead 40-39 with 15:03 left. But Georgetown, spurred
by 5 points from Alonzo Mourning, took off on a 9-0 run that put the game away. Elder, who has
2 years of eligibility remaining at Vandy, scored 6 points (2-6 fg, 2-2 ft) and handed out 4 assists. He
finished the season averaging over 11 points and 5 rebounds for the Commodores, who finished 17-13.

Front Continued from Page 10

Zimmerman led the team in scoring with 12.5 per game, was among the conference leaders in 3-point field goal percentage,
and was among the national leaders in free throw percentage at 86.3%. Musch scored 9.9 points a game for the
second year in a row, but his points were more significant this year in that they came on a team
with more offensive weapons. His growth as a player was obvious and impressive. Holloway averaged 9.0 points, Narat 8.3, Paul
Denmond 7.3, and Marsh 7.1. Marsh was among the conference’s best rebounders at 6.2 per game. Both Zimmerman and Musch
were 2nd team All-Big South selections. The team’s trademark has become its consistent defense; the ‘Cats held 22 of their
29 opponents under 50% shooting from the field. Ten of those 22 shot 40% or under.

Frosh Lead Golf Team
By Bruce Page

With their spring season newly underway, Davidson’s golf team is showing well, and coach Gordon Mietz is pleased with the
progress he is seeing. In the fall season, freshman Will Coble was the Wildcats’ most productive player, leading the team
with a 76 stroke average. Senior Captain Mike Maggart and Junior Craig Leonard were second and third, respectively, and freshmen
Mark Raber and Will McDaniel rounded out Coach Mietz’s starting unit. In an interview with The Davidsonian, Coach Mietz spoke
extensively of the potential for excellence he saw demonstrated by all of his players. Mietz says all have shot in
the low to mid-70’s and he believes they can continue to do so. Mietz is also very hopeful for the
future of the Davidson team. This year’s team loses only one senior, and Mietz is anticipating the arrival of some
talented recruits for his team. Davidson looks forward to a successful spring season from the team, which figures to play
very competitively this year and continue to improve in the future.

Wildcat opponents averaged 44.0% from the floor. Davidson's defense even drew the praise of Mike Krzyzewski, whose Duke teams are
considered by many to play the finest defense in the country, after the ‘Cats held the Blue Devils under 30%
shooting in the first half. Better yet, the Wildcats lose just two players to graduation, co-captains Darry Strickland and Turner
Gilmore. Strickland was a presence that will be missed; Gilmore was limited by injury to action in just 2 games.
Guard Paul Denmond will be the rock of experience for the team next year. With 807 points in three years
of extensive play, he could join the 1,000 point club sometime next year.

I can’t even begin to express what a bad idea it is to have classes during the early rounds of
the NCAA Tournament. I don’t mean to imply that basketball is more important than academics—I mean to state it as
obvious fact. Unfortunately, there is a direct correlation between the number of basketball games watched and the number of GPA
points lost, as I can well attest.

On the subject of the NCAA Tournament, one problem with having a 64-team tournament and 32 first-round games is that
any network that tries to cover them all inevitably scrapes the bottom of the barrel. I heard a couple of
announcers over the weekend say that, for announcers, this was their favorite time of the year. And it’s no wonder;
every hack announcer on the continent is paid to butcher first and second-round games. Bill Walton, the former UCLA and
NBA star, littered the airwaves with pointless platitudes all weekend. He and Mimi Griffin are hereby banished from ever announcing
another game. Mimi’s exile from broadcasterdom is not meant to imply that women cannot proficiently broadcast sports—it just seems that
way.
