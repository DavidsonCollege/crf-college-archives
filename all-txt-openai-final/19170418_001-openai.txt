Roanoke Defeats Davidson In Debate  
Wins Two to One Decision Over Davidson Team.

Davidson matched her debating team with Roanoke’s on the platform at Salem, Virginia, last Friday night. The subject of the debate was: “Resolved, That the United States should adopt a system of compulsory military service.” Messrs. W. C. Robinson and O. F. Blackwelder, of Roanoke, upheld the affirmative; R. H. Ratchford and J. A. Thames, of Davidson, the negative. The judges rendered a decision two to one in favor of Roanoke.

Mr. Robinson, of Roanoke, opened the debate. He showed how inadequate our present army is for our defense. He argued that our volunteer system had fallen down in the past and that we had suffered greatly by using untrained soldiers. He also contended that our navy was inefficient, poorly equipped, and slow, and that we had a ten thousand mile coast practically undefended.

Mr. R. H. Ratchford was the first speaker on the negative for Davidson. He showed that compulsory service was incompatible with American ideals, and that it was militaristic in tendency, eventually leading to militarism. That it was undemocratic in its very nature. He refuted the argument of the affirmative that compulsory service would be democratic because it would be universal and affected everyone alike, by saying that to imprison everybody would be universal, but would not be democratic. He said that Germany had this system, that everyone bore the same burdens and obeyed the same orders, therefore Germany was an ideal democracy according to his opponent's argument. He also showed how our volunteer system had won every war in the past.

Mr. Blackwelder was the second and last speaker for Roanoke. He argued that service in the army would make the American youth more obedient and law-abiding, that it would make them more patriotic and give them a broader view, at the same time giving them good physical training. He argued that compulsory service in the United States would be democratic because the orders would come from the people and not from a Kaiser, as in Germany. He closed by asserting that Great Britain had the “compulsory system,” and Germany the “volunteer system.” His speech was marked by fine oratory and sarcasm.

Mr. Thames closed the debate for Davidson. He overwhelmed his opponents with facts, logic and sarcasm, taking up their own statements and turning the tables on them. He contended that the affirmative had to show that we needed a powerful army all the time for our safety, before they could prove their side. He showed how difficult it was for any nation to land and equip an army across the ocean. That England had not landed a single soldier on German soil in spite of the fact that her navy was four times superior to Germany’s, and that Germany, with her powerful navy, had not landed a single soldier on Russian soil. He also pointed out the slowness of the Gallipoli, Salonica expeditions. Then he asked the question if any German professor could invent a powder (Continued on page 6)

Red and Black Nine Win Three And Tie One Out of Four Games  
Ties and Wins One From Trinity. And A. and E.----Carolina Wins 1 to 0.

Davidson won the second game of the past week by defeating Wake Forest on Sprunt Field here on Wednesday afternoon by a 3-1 score. The game was slow but interesting. In the early stages of the game Wake Forest secured a one run lead, but in the seventh Davidson came back strong by scoring all three of her runs. With Miller on base Keesler singled, scoring him. Keesler then stole second. At this point Hengeveld proceeded to win his own game with a drive to center field, which he managed to stretch into a home run, scoring Keesler ahead of him.

One of the prettiest fielding features of the game was a catch of a foul fly by Legget in the seventh, the player falling over the visitors’ bench in making the catch, but retaining the ball. For Wake Forest, Cox and Ellis were the stars, while Saunders and Flowers were the Davidson leaders. Both pitchers twirled a steady game and showed up well.

Davidson walked away with Trinity at Statesville Thursday in the second game of the series to a score of 10 to 3. Trinity got aTwo-run lead in the first inning on an error by Johnston and a home run by Lefler, but gave little trouble thereafter.

In one of the fastest and most interesting games staged on the Hill this season, Trinity and Davidson struggled to a tie last Friday afternoon. The game was held up until 4:30 o'clock on account of threatening rain, and at that time, the weather looking favorable, the game was begun. The Red and Black swatters took a lead in the first inning when by a series of walks and hits they put three runs across to their credit. In the fourth inning, Trinity came in strong, bunching several beautiful hits and scoring three runs, tying the score. There was considerable hitting on both sides, besides the bunching that resulted in the 3 to 3 score, but all were sufficiently scattered to not allow any additional runs. Both teams threatened to score after the fourth inning, but the extra tap could not be made. The game was called off after the seventh inning on account of darkness. In the individual starring list may be placed Beal, first-baseman for Trinity. He played a good game at first, and his hitting was spectacular. The pitching on both sides was good, both striking out 8 men each and keeping the hits well scattered. Box-score: (Continued on page 6)
