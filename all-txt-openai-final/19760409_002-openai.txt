### Faculty Censures  
By MATTHEW COVINGTON  
Editor  

Tuesday, while the new basketball coach was collecting his things at Maryland, and Davidson College students were planning a march to protest the academic calendar, the faculty met and passed resolutions. These resolutions were worded as protest measures. The first protested the trustee decision to pursue a national level basketball program:

> The Faculty hereby expresses to the Board of Trustees its concern over the recent action of the Trustees regarding the intercollegiate basketball program at Davidson. Over a period of years, members of the Faculty have questioned the wisdom of subsidized athletics at Davidson. We affirm our opposition to the present commitment to a “national level basketball program,” both on principle and as a matter of economic practicality. We believe that the stated assumptions on which the Trustees’ action was based are of questionable validity.

Before taking a vote, which showed about two-thirds of the faculty in favor of the resolution, the faculty heard discussion from its members. One professor suggested that the new basketball coach could make $60,000 a year. He compared this figure with the average salary of a professor at Davidson which is about one-third the amount. Other discussions centered on the claims that Davidson will have to lower its admission standards for exceptional athletes. The entire integrity of the athletic program was questioned at one point when it was implied that Gary Walters, the head coach at Dartmouth who accepted and then declined the Davidson head coaching offer, had been asked to go against his conscience and break his contract with Dartmouth.

The faculty also passed a resolution protesting the scheduling of Spring Frolics weekend:

> Resolved: that the Davidson College faculty protests the scheduling of Spring Frolics on Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and the Saturday of Easter weekend as inconsonant with the college’s religious commitment and as offensive to the religious sensibilities of many in the college community and the town.

The faculty heard a statement on the situation from Union President Karl Goodhouse who defended the scheduling of Spring Frolics on the basis that Easter weekend seemed to be the least offensive to everyone concerned. The faculty voted in favor of the resolution by a voice vote. It was not by an overwhelming majority.

### Dormitory Crime Increases  
Meetze Laments Repair Bill  
By MATTHEW COVINGTON  
Editor  

Davidson College is suffering from an increase of campus vandalism. The reparation of damages will cost the college over $5000 this year alone. The college is not making an attempt to increase discipline of student vandals but is instead appealing to students and student groups to police themselves.

In recent weeks a prankster has removed the hinges from a bathroom door so that the next person to come in would accidentally knock the door down and damage a urinal. The urinal cost $4000 to replace. The doors and shower curtains in bathrooms in Watts were removed, forcing girls on these halls to call the physical plant to repair the damage by working overtime. Two entire windows were destroyed in...Sentelle. Reparation of this damage will take extra time because the woodwork must be copied. "In the past three years vandalism has doubled as far as frequencies are concerned," said Director of the Physical Plant Grover C. Meetze, Jr. "Horseplay with fire extinguishers has doubled. It's gotten to the point that we can’t keep them in the buildings," said Meetze. "It is $1000 a year just to replace fire extinguishers. It takes about nine dollars apiece." Meetze said that it is his philosophy that a building should be maintained in as good a condition as possible. This makes it more attractive to the students who live there and do not take part in destruction. According to Meetze, however, competent maintenance is not a deterrent to vandals. Dean of Students Will H. Terry believes the problem of current vandalism began with a lack of discipline on freshmen halls. "Vandalism is part of an attitude we have allowed to develop from freshman year. [see TERRY, page 6]

mind. These include a display area for Davidson’s own art collection and student exhibits and a home for the Davidson National," said Williams. "By locating this art gallery at the center of the campus, we are symbolically and literally emphasizing the importance of the arts at a liberal arts college. The Cunningham Fine Arts Building is clearly inadequate for present and projected needs," said Williams. "The Department of Drama and Speech needs new classroom, production, and storage facilities. No definite plans at all have been made, but a building of 20,000 square feet should house the Department.

"Physical education facilities and intramural needs are becoming increasingly acute," said Williams. "Officials of the Athletic Department are working on plans for a sports complex that might include additional athletic fields, indoor tennis courts, indoor track, additional handball and squash courts, swimming pool, and a non-spectator basketball fieldhouse with several courts.

Williams: "Additional housing will be provided, but not traditional housing along the lines of present dorms," said Williams. "In recent years other schools have suffered a loss in enrollment. We don’t anticipate that happening here, but if it should, we wouldn’t be able to convert a traditional dorm to any other use.

"The College owns about 60 houses in the area, in varying states of repair, which it rents to faculty, staff, and others," continued Williams. "Some of the dwellings are on the fringe of the campus, and we plan to make these perimeter houses available to students.

"I don’t think we’re sacrificing our character as a residential campus by not building a new dorm as some have charged. Many people, especially older students, prefer the unit-type living of perimeter housing," said Williams. Piecemeal renovation of dorms will occur in the summers as funds become available.

"The present food service setup is inefficient," said Williams. "It is widely recognized that so many kitchens and cooks are not economical. The eating-house concept works well with lesser enrollments," he continued, "but it isn’t viable for the future, especially if enrollment increases to 1500.

"No new construction will be undertaken until funds are on hand to complete the job and money is endowed to maintain the building," concluded Williams.
