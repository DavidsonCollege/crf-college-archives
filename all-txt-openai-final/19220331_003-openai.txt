THE DAVIDSONIAN, MARCH 31, 1922.

CHRISTIAN ACTIVITIES

DR. J. M. WELLS TO SPEAK AT “Y” SERVICE ON SUNDAY

Dr. John M. Wells, president of Columbia Seminary, is to be the speaker at the Y. M. C. A. vesper
service next Sunday night. He is a graduate of Southwestern University, Clarksville, Tenn., and of Union Theological Seminary, at Richmond.
While a student, Doctor Wells was a football player and carries now the scars of former battles on the gridiron.
He was pastor of the First Presbyterian Church in Wilmington, N. C., for 20 years, from 1901 to 1921, during
which time this church increased with a rapidity that was greater than the increase in population of the city. For
the year 1917-18, he was moderator of the General Assembly. In 1921, he assumed his duties as the president of
Columbia Seminary, and is also professor of Pastoral Theology in that institution. Since his arrival, this seminary has taken on
new life. The students of the seminary say such things as: “He is a prince,” and “I would rather go
to his class than play a set of tennis,” which is saying a lot, but Doctor Wells is just that
sort of man. He is a thorough scholar, a forceful speaker, and a man’s man, and is recognized as a
real leader not only in the Southern Presbyterian Church but among ecclesiastical bodies generally. While here, Doctor Wells will conduct
several other meetings besides the Sunday night service, and interviews will probably be secured for those who desire them.

FIVE MEN COMPOSE THE “Y” TEAM ON KINGS MT. TRIP

The Y. M. C. A. deputation which went to Kings Mountain last week received a hearty welcome, and an enthusiastic
response seldom met with in work of this kind. The team was composed of McKethan, Houghton, Sorrells, LaFar, and Hillhouse,
leaving Davidson Saturday afternoon and returning Wednesday. The team worked mainly in the High School, especially among the boys. Four
meetings were held in the school during the two days at which various members of the team spoke on different
phases of the Christian life, especially as it related to student life. The central thought of the services was “Come
Clean” in athletics, in social life, in school work, and in religious matters. On Sunday, the members of the team
distributed themselves about the various churches assisting in the Sunday School work, and meeting with the Young People’s Societies. Sunday
afternoon, a mass meeting of the young people of the various churches was held and the series of meetings was
inaugurated by a talk from two of the Davidson boys. Of especial interest is the athletic work the members of
the deputation engaged in. Monday afternoon, the party joined a group of High School boys in a game of baseball.
Tuesday, the five Davidson boys formed themselves into a basketball team and defeated the Varsity team of the High School
in a fast, clean game. This game aroused great interest and comment, especially as the High School team is champion
of the surrounding district. Doc LaFar seems to have been the star of the game. On the whole, the trip
could hardly have been more successful, and several decisions were formed as a result of the meetings.

It was with very evident pleasure that the Y. M. C. A. Board of Control announced recently that Buck Currie
has accepted the position of Davidson Y. M. C. A. Secretary for next year. Buck, of course, was president of
the student body last year, and our star baseball pitcher. He is now principal of the Davidson High School. Buck
was one of the leading spirits in the Y. M. C. A. during his college career, being on the cabinet
two years as secretary and vice-president, and having charge of one of the Mission Sunday Schools. There has never been
any question as to his ability to fill the position of Y Secretary, and his decision to accept it came
as a very pleasant surprise to all concerned.

C. E. TRAINING CLASS MEN VISIT EPWORTH LEAGUERS

MOVIES SATURDAY NIGHT

Last Sunday afternoon, the Christian Endeavor Training Class sent a deputation to the Fairview Church, near Mt. Mourne, where they
held a short conference with the Epworth League leaders of that place. The deputation consisted of Gamble, McIntyre, J. L.
McLean, and C. C. Miller. At the meeting of the Junior and Senior League, Gamble and McLean made short talks,
which were well received and enjoyed. For the near future, the Training Class is working on several interesting deputations. J.
L. McLean, chairman of the Training Class here, is in communication with the leaders of Christian Endeavor organizations at a
number of points, and states that a number of deputations will be sent out soon. He is also in communication
with the State Secretary of the Christian Endeavor and is making arrangements to send delegates to the District Convention at
Belmont in April. A small deputation to Center Church will probably be arranged for the near future. Under the able
leadership of Gamble, the class has decided to have a special course for each phase of the work. This, it
is thought, will bring about the best possible results. Although the deputation movement is a new one in the Chris-tian
Endeavor Training Class, much activity along this line is planned for the near future.

R. O. T. C. HAS MUSEUM OF CONSIDERABLE INTEREST

One of the novel features which added much to the attractions of Junior Speaking was the opening of the R.
O. T. C. museum to visitors on the last evening of speaking. Especially interesting was the sand table reproduction of
a section of the golf course extending across the course in the general line of Hole No. 2 and Hole
No. 3 of the golf course, from the negro cemetery across toward Concord Road. This sand table map of such
a familiar piece of terrain not only gives an excellent opportunity to compare the actual lay of the land with
its reproduction on such a map but is also to be used in working out one of the most practical
military maneuvers ever staged at Davidson.

A sham battle soon to be fought by the different units of the Davidson Battalion on this terrain is now
being worked out on this sand table by the whole class of cadet officers. Company “A,” under Cadet Captain Richards,
with the advice and assistance of Captain Ellis, is to defend Cemetery Ridge against an attack to be launched from
Concord Ridge by the other three companies under Cadet Major Phillips, with the advice and assistance of Major Hearn. Both
forces are to be fully equipped with machine guns and in addition light artillery and trench mortar fire is to
be assumed.

The rifle match with Georgia Tech to be held Saturday promises to be a close and interesting contest. Tech is
reported to have a record firing team and Davidson's best shots are to be selected to fire this match.

Over 400 students and professors from the universities in and around Vienna, Austria, met at the University of Vienna on
January 17th for consideration of the problem of alcoholism. The meeting had been widely advertised and was attended by the
President of Austria and many other prominent officials. A popular professor spoke against alcoholism and was followed by two students.
Then a resolution adopted by a vote of 305 to 15, asking the government to prepare quickly a law prohibiting
the use of alcohol as a beverage, was voted.
