### A Kind of Homecoming

**Alumnus Jason Thompson Returns**

*by Mark Murrey ‘83*

It has taken a few years and many miles, but Jason Thompson is back in the Davidson classroom. This time,
however, he is on the other side of the desk.

As the latest addition to the Davidson Economics Department, Professor Thompson recalls, “I had a dream when I was at
Davidson that I would come back to take Bobby Avinger’s or Randy Kincaid’s place when one of them retired.” With
Kincaid on leave of absence and Avinger pursuing other career interests, these positions became available long before the young Thompson
expected.

By chance, while passing through early last year, he found that the Economics Department was interviewing to fill the vacated
positions. After sending a résumé and having a few interviews, he is teaching introductory economics and a seminar in urban
economics.

From an alumnus’s perspective, he has found that, “on the first day of class, I saw that things had not
changed much; students' attitudes toward their work are very much the same.” He notes, however, a broader range of reaction
in the classroom as a result of co-education.

Recalling some of his favorite Davidson experiences, Thompson spoke fondly of his junior year in Marburg, Germany, and winter term
senior year in Spain. Those experiences increased his knowledge and interest in foreign languages and international economic studies.

At the University of Texas, Thompson pursued a master's degree in Latin American Studies concentrating on international business and economic
development. He then participated in a three-month marketing study in Brazil. Afterwards, Thompson received a master's degree in Economic Development
and Economic History at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst where he is presently writing his doctoral dissertation.

After being in school for so long, the young economist wanted some non-academic experience. “I needed to get out and
test the classroom theories,” he said. Remaining in the East, Thompson received a position in the Boston Redevelopment Authority where
he has worked for the past three and a half years. “The office was in City Hall, at the heart
of Boston and the work was exciting and dynamic.” Such projects as urban revitalization, hotel and office tower developments, and
residential developments were the orders of the day.

Now back in academic life, Professor Thompson is glad to see the students’ new interest in economics. “When I was
in school they talked of fine-tuning the economy and not many were interested in economic analysis,” but now he explains
that economic instability makes it difficult to find a consensus on policy. “That’s what makes it interesting.”

But he seems to take it all pretty coolly. As he sits reading on the Union patio, his necktie is
all that reveals whether he is to lecture or be lectured. “It’s a lot of work,” he confides, “but I’m
enjoying it.”
