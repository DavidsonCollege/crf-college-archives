NOTED BIOLOGIST

His new textbook on prevention of future conflicts can be had by offering modern scientific developments to needy peoples. Brother
Pritchard spent the early morning hours in the Queen City serenading the Mayfair set with his original version of a
currently popular hit, “Bamboo, Bamboo—Don’t Wanna Leave the Bamboo.” Richard, with the adjustable halo, spent the weekend engaged in nefarious
activities in Charleston, S.C., where the Ashley and Cooper rivers converge. Brother Ha was in the Chez Montet drowning his
sorrows in a bowl of vichyssoise. Don’t worry, child, Beverly is keeping the home fires burning.

KAPPA ALPHA
Feathers will fall this week, just about every brother within a hundred-mile radius is going to be home for Thanksgiving,
despite the Furman fracas. Of course, many will see the Wildcats win, which should be the biggest disappointment of last
week. Gastonia’s gridiron group would have to be a Rose Bowl team to do the things that “Sealed-Beam” and “Morph”
predicted. Needless to say, Stokes, Glasgow, and “Shakey” et al. were beaming over Central's win. Durham Day was Saturday when
Brothers Baxter, Biggers, Erwin, Matthews, and Johnson were numbered among the thousands. It is rumored that Matthew's presence had much
to do with “Choo-Choo's” performance. On the S.A.E. front, Brothers Preyer, Fowle, Mitchell, and Barron were on hand for the
Citadel slaughter. Charlie deserves a hand for his fine work as a cheerleader this season. The word from Queens is
that “Green Streak” Holt set a new record between here and Durham.

HAMILTON, known in the South as the team to do the things that “Sealed-Beam” and “Morph” predicted, spent the past
week-end with most of the brothers off to seek adventure in distant places. Many of them made the pilgrimage to
Durham in the bumper-to-bumper traffic. Those included Brothers Neisler, Williams, Holt, Richardson, White, Gallant, Murphy, and pledges Maner and Joy.

HURRICANE, 20-6...

The Cats made only one serious penetration, that to the Furman 16-yard line, but the Hurricane stiffened and repulsed the
Cat attack. Time and time again, the Wildcats drove to the shadows of the Davidson goal line, but each time
an inspired Wildcat forward line...To arrive for the kick-off party, (an ir the) to offer sufficient power, then you saw
an unknown crew of KAs descended. He really enjoyed the well-lit, newly iced transportation, and industrial on the campus Saturday
night, and hopes to find it sometime. Determined goal growth to give balanced economy. Among the described were: A Gallant

Charlotte 2, North Carolina. Responsibility to apply what we wave trombone player. When seen last night—tea sets. We should be
motivated by our political struggle. The recreation room did. We have to be motivated by our aim and we will
have me.

State, Washington and Lee. The Cats, ranked among the final conference standings with a season record of three wins, three
losses, and one tie, which is one of the best standings.
