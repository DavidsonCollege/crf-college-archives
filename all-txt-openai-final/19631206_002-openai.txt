**Christmas For The Collegian**

Before Thanksgiving, American merchants began to gaily toot their horns, heralding the coming of Christ and advertising “good deals” for all potential wise men. The prematurity of this perennial call to Santa Claus-dom is distressing, to say the least. But, nevertheless, we must now admit that Christmas is upon us, with all its expected joys—both real and inappropriate.

Christmas for the college man is a time of brightly colored reunion parties with old high school friends, highlighted by eggnog and the seemingly sad realization that you no longer have much in common with the old “group.” The golden “leaders” aren’t leaders anymore; the hometown basketball team looks pitifully small; Sally-next-door has a baby, and her husband works the night shift in a mill somewhere. Education wears different clothes at every school. The problems and solutions, the worries and joys of life at Davidson don’t seem to be shared by George-at-UNC or Jeanie-at-Ole Miss or Dave-at-Dickinson. We have all been aged in different vats, and there seems to be nothing to talk about.

We from Davidson will brag about our basketball team, make implausible excuses for our miserable football season, relate various embarrassing and eventful moments of Homecoming, say nasty things about the administration—just because it is the administration, and generally gripe about returning to the cold greyness of a Davidson January, made even more bitter by the ominous fact of last-minute reviews and exams. But does anyone really care? “After all, we are different,” they say.

Christmas for the college student is also a time of trying in vain to be really a part of the family again. Or, maybe, it is a time when we realize that our relationship to our family is not quite the same as it was before we ventured off to college. Thomas Wolfe's “you can’t go home again” seems sadly appropriate. The love is still there, the grass still needs cutting, and there is still a crack in the front steps, but the guest towels in the bathroom are a silent reminder that Davidson is “home.”

Christmas is many other things for the college student. It is working in a department store rush to earn extra money and to avoid the uneasy boredom of sitting at home. It is driving by the high school at lunch hour and feeling strangely grown-up. It may be the careful observation of faces and noises on a crowded Christmas-Eve street. Or it may be taking particular pride in buying something extra nice for your mom, and paying for it yourself. Perhaps it will mean seemingly unlimited time with a sweetheart or loved one—time to spend too much time with her, unconsciously trying to make up for three months of going to movies and being back on the campus by midnight.

Christmas 1963, no matter how gay and joyous, will find us still clothed in a lingering shame and grief because of the world’s horror on November 22. Both human decency and American democracy were dealt harsh blows on that day. Christmas 1963 must find us thankful that our nation survived this wound. And, yet, despite our worries about the future and the general pain of growing up, each of us knows the happiness that is Christmas, and each will leave Davidson next week expecting to experience again this happiness.

For some, Christmas 1963 will find its meaning in the events of 2000 years ago. For others, Christmas 1963 will find expression in the giving of things material and of ourselves. And, for many, Christmas 1963 will be a pure and simple enjoyment of the proverbial “spirit” of Christmas.

And THE DAVIDSONIAN takes this opportunity to wish for you all a meaningful Christmas—in whichever way you choose to make it so.

**The Spirit Of Christmas**

A few weeks ago, Will Terry received a letter from CARE, Inc. with information concerning the anesthesia machine donated to the CARE/MEDICO hospital at Lomphat, Cambodia by the student body through last year’s Christmas Gift Fund. Although shipped from New York on May 22, the machine still has not arrived at its destination. However, this delay is not unusual in view of the remoteness of Lomphat. “Allow a couple of months to Saigon, Viet Nam; another two weeks waiting transshipment to Phnom Penh, Cambodia (then consider briefly that Cambodia suspended diplomatic relations with Viet Nam two months ago which should not, but may well, delay transshipment); then, when the anesthesia machine finally arrives in Phnom Penh, it still has a long and hard trip inland via Koratie to Lomphat (which is in the northwest corner of the country, is unreachable by land six months out of the year, and must normally receive all shipments by means of the tortuous Mekong River route as far as Strung-Treng, then through the Tonle and Srepok Rivers to Lomphat).”

That’s a lot of trouble. But it seems to us that this gift and the circumstances surrounding it illustrate your willingness to give generously wherever and whenever the need arises, regardless of political circumstances. One final note which might cause us all some reflection in this Christmas season is contained in the following excerpt from a letter of the Cambodian Prime Minister, Prince Norodom Sihanouk: “I have had occasion to appreciate CARE/MEDICO's efficient and dedicated approach to the task it has undertaken—particularly in the course of my visit to the center at Lomphat in April of last year—and I'm personally of the opinion that aid inspired solely by a desire to be of service to the less privileged in countries equipping themselves as best they may to play a worthy part in the modern world, can assist greatly in bridging the gulf fixed between peoples of different color, civilization and creed by creating that feeling of universal brotherhood which is so urgently needed for the peaceful settlement of international disputes. Thanking you for the good work your organization is doing on behalf of my people, I am yours very truly.

N. Sihanouk
Chief of State of Cambodia”

**Secor On Commitment: The Promise Not To Run**

BY PHILIP B. SECOR
Asst. Prof. of Political Science

“Certainly the professors would share our grief. Perhaps they would have some insight, some consolation. They are men of learning, men of wisdom, Christian men of commitment... Yet in the classroom we experienced even more frustration; for most professors lectured as always as if nothing had happened... But we scream hopelessly... If history, English, economics, and psychology have nothing to say, then why go on pretending any longer? If men have commitment... now is the time to express their commitment.”

This was the reaction of Joe Howell, Davidson senior, YMCA president and pre-theological student in the Dec. 1 issue of THE DAVIDSONIAN. This was his reaction to the response of his professors to the tragic death of President Kennedy. Certainly no one member of the Davidson faculty, especially not a newcomer to that faculty, can speak to Joe Howell's demanding complaint for all or any of his colleagues. So, what I have to say now is only my own feeble attempt to respond. I want to make this reply in part because of my friendship for Joe and my high regard forhim. In a more general sense, however, this is not a reply to Joe at all but to the many students for whom I suspect Joe speaks. When I hear:

"You have dropped your dusty cloak and taken your wondrous wings to another sphere, where no pain is: Then shall I hush this dinning gear."

Why poetry, Joe? Would you prefer something political or scientific? Shall I be “relevant?” Something about government of laws: the marvel of peaceful succession of a new man to the presidency; the effect of murder on the political aspirations of Barry Goldwater? How about something on the history of assassinations of heads of government? Perhaps you want to hear that God has forgiven Mr. Oswald and Mr. Ruby and you and me; that the grave is not final.

WASHINGTON, D. C., NOV. 25 effectively articulated a deep feeling of resentment and frustration. First, Joe, why does this response come now, so long after death and not on the morning of the first day? Why do “committed” men so often seem to go about their business on the morning of the first day? Thomas Hardy asked the question and gave an answer:

“Why do I go on doing these things? Why not cease? Is it that you are yet in this world of welterings and unease, and that, while so, mechanical repetitions please? When shall I leave off doing these things?”

Should I quote scripture? Should I say that time heals all pain? The king is dead, long live the king? Hatred breeds self-destruction? You tell me, Joe. Is man good or evil? Can freedom and authority ever be reconciled? Does God care? Do history, English, economics, psychology, and Christianity have any relevance—in New York slums? in Birmingham jails? on a Dallas street?

“Should we go on pretending?” you ask. Is it a pretense? Do we have a choice to pretend or not to pretend? Indeed, “we scream hopelessly.” Indeed, “if men have commitment, now is the time to express their commitment.” The trouble is, Joe, that we—you and I—each scream hopelessly; we each seek commitment and relevance. This may be an unending hopelessness or an unending search ennobled only by hope. I cannot impose upon you my own small scraps of belief tied to life, as they are, only by thin and fragile strands of relevance. The comfort of certainty which I spoon to children on Friday and Saturday and Sunday, I can’t give to you. You are a member of an adult academic community filled with sensitive people who do lack answers, who do struggle with fierce doubts and agonize to believe and relate. I wish that I had more to offer you. Inspiration, perhaps. Some of the tools with which to construct your own relevant faith, perhaps. But if it is to be only frustration, so be it. Much of order, faith, and even beauty may be constructed on this existential foundation.

If there is one positive response (commitment) I am willing to offer to the question of the relevance of the Christian academic profession to the death of the president, it is this: The search for knowledge and relevance in a Christian college is carried on within the community of Christian love. There may be no comforting and relevant response from the psychologist as psychologist or from the historian as historian or from the English professor as English professor. But there is—or certainly there should be—a community in which students and faculty alike with mutual and supportive respect, tolerance, and love pursue what they may never achieve—knowledge which is both true and relevant.

The poet, James Stephens, posed the problem to which the Christian college should offer an answer:

“My enemy came nigh; And I stared fiercely in his face: My lips went writhing back in a grimace, And stern I watched him from a narrowed eye: Then as I turned away, My enemy, That bitter-heart, and savage, said to me: ‘Some day, when this is past; When all the arrows have been cast; We may ask one another why we hate? And fail to find a story to relate: It may seem to us, then, a mystery That we could hate each other — Thus said he; and did not turn away; Waiting to hear what I might have to say! But I fled quickly; fearing, if I stayed, I might have kissed him as I would a maid.”

All that I can give you, Joe, as a teacher trying to be true to Christian commitment within an adult academic environment, is the promise not to run away.

Europeans Mourn Death; No President Rated Higher

Saturday, Nov. 23, was to begin a weekend of reunion and reminiscence for three Charlotteans (myself, my wife Sue, and Graham Allison) now studying in England. But at 7 p.m. Friday, the news was received that President Kennedy had been assassinated. After two days, the great enormity of this act has still not fully registered in our minds. We were stunned, and we remain stunned. The three of us spent the weekend huddled near a radio, perplexed and wondering. For the first time, we had felt a part of universal grief.

One year in a foreign country has taught us more about what it means to be an American than all the fulminations of our professional patriots on the right could ever do. The Cuban crisis showed that the fate of the West does rest ultimately in American hands, whatever our alliances, U.N. commitment, and proclamations of multilateral dependence would have the world believe. The death of John Kennedy demonstrated that the trust and hope of the West had become focused as well as in America, in the man who was its President. It is not inappropriate that the man who had awakened the West to the collective nature of its peril has been the medium of a mutuality of suffering and human sympathy which has no historical parallel. Never have so many people in so many lands shared so personally a single moment in time.

That Kennedy had always been more universally popular abroad than he ever was at home is well known; what no one had anticipated was the manner in which millions of people—the great, the humble, the uninformed, the wise—had placed part of their hope for the future in the image of this one man. The response in Britain has been profoundly moving: strangers shyly approach Americans in the street and express their regrets; radio and television programs were canceled Friday and Saturday and replaced with somber music and news announcements; the American embassy and Air Force bases were deluged with calls from people expressing sorrow; in Cambridge, each of the college chapels had a commemorative service and college sports events were canceled; by Monday, one British newspaper had raised over $5,000 by public subscription of not more than $5 each for a statue to commemorate the President. In other nations, the response has been the same. Even East German guards at Checkpoint Charlie spontaneously lowered their flag in deference to the Stars and Stripes flying at half-mast across the Wall.

I dwell on these happenings because it is important to know what the figure of Kennedy meant to Europe. No other American President has ever raised our prestige, our reputation for reason, competence, and fairness quite so high. Many in the South would not share this assessment of Kennedy, but they have not seen what his leadership has meant to a Europe shaken by eight years of bluster by Dulles, of benign but fuzzy incompetence by Eisenhower. Kennedy as a statesman towered so far above any other contemporary statesman in the West, that our admirers in Europe fear that his passing may cause a malevolent vacuum in our capacity to sustain peace.

The spontaneous sympathy of Europe contrasts with a report in the London press of approval, even exultation by some groups in the news at Kennedy's death. I do not believe that this report is indicative in the most superficial sense of southern reaction, but it does demonstrate how the irresponsible maundering of a few misled bigoted men can darken a region’s image. Justly or unjustly, the fact is that in much of the world today, the South has become anathema by the same standards of judgment which make John Kennedy's death a tragedy and heartbreak.
