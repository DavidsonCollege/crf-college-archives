Davidson’s Share Is Oversubscribed
Splendid Total Made By Student Subscribers to Fund.

The Y. M. C. A. War Fund campaign was completed at Davidson last week. Never before in the history of
the college was there such a universal spirit of sacrifice as was manifested in this campaign. Davidson’s share was $2,000.
To organize for the canvass of the student body, about thirty-five prominent men were collected for a meeting Wednesday night.
At this meeting, they were informed as to conditions and inspired to do their best. Seventeen couples were formed who
were to see every man in college the next night and solicit his subscription. As the meeting broke up, it
was announced that the results would be counted at 11 o'clock the next night. The students responded nobly to the
appeal and the amount crept steadily nearer the goal, $2,000, as each additional couple came in and reported. At ten
minutes past ten, when the last team arrived and reported, a cheer broke out, for it was seen that Davidson
had exceeded her assigned amount by $18. Several additional subscriptions have been received since that time and with the $160
subscribed by the faculty, the total sum subscribed now amounts to $2,303.75.

Wake Forest Humbled By Red and Black
Overwhelmingly Outclassed Despite Weight. Score 72-7.

The Davidson Red-Skins left their hunting grounds Saturday and took the war-path to the city of Greensboro and there completely
massacred the settlers from Wake Forest. They returned to their wigwams and hung the scalp of Wake Forest to the
ridge pole, beside the scalps of Auburn and V. M. I. The final score was 72-7—that is, 72 for Davidson
and 7 for Wake Forest. The Davidson warriors drew out and left the Wake Forest team as victims of a
massacre. Davidson had definitely asked Wake Forest to cease their assault, but the Wake Forest team continued, leading to their
overwhelming defeat.

DAVIDSON STUDENTS

The amount raised was $660; $160 of which will go to the students’ fund. This speaks well for Davidson and
shows that she deeply feels the spirit of the times.Guard Mebane .. .. .. .. E. A. Woods (1)

LEAVE FOR ACTIVE DUTY
With the mobilization of the Brenizer Hospital Unit, O. W. M. Gibson, ’19, who is a member of this unit,
was called from his college work to join the colors. Gibson left for his home in Statesville, Friday, November 10,
and on the following Monday went to Charlotte to join the other members of the organization there to await transportation
to Fort McPherson, Ga. After a short period of intensive training, the unit expects to be sent to France.

R. W. Robinson, ’19, enlisted with the Marines at the recruiting station in Charlotte on Monday of last week. On
Tuesday he left college for his home in Steele Creek, and on Thursday left Charlotte for Paris Island, S. C.,
where he will be in training for fourteen weeks. After a ten days’ furlough at the end of his training,
he will be sent to a distribution camp, where he will await the call to active service.

The Freshmen defeated the Seniors in a fast basketball game Thursday evening. Both teams fought hard from the beginning to
the end, but the Freshmen outplayed the Seniors in the last half, winning 20-13. McCachen, for the Freshmen, and Hawkins,
for the Seniors, deserve special mention for their good work.

JUNIORS VS. SOPHS.
One of the best games of the season was witnessed Saturday evening between the Juniors and Sophomores. Every man in
the game played hard, as both teams were contending enviously for the victory. McAskill and Alexander, for the Juniors, and
Chalmers, for the Sophomores, were easily the stars of the game.

The meeting of the Christian Endeavor Society last night was held by W. Worth; the subject was, “Our Foreign Missions,”
and, as the leader is the son of a missionary, a profitable and enjoyable meeting was held. Next Sunday there
will be held the monthly joint meeting of the Christian Endeavor Society, the Ministerial and Volunteer Bands, with J. R.
Woods as the leader.

An article on a reception held for the Freshmen in the September 9th issue serves as a good example of
“the well-spoken” Davidson gentleman at the turn of the century. The Freshmen were introduced to the “traditions and institutions of
the college.” Davidson students expressed themselves in a unique manner. Today we read articles and conduct meetings in a very
quick and business-like fashion. In 1914, we did not have simply the SGA, but “a very quick and business-like description.”
