THE DAVIDSONIAN, MAY 3, 1933

DAVIDSON NINE CONTINUES TO LEAD IN BIG FIVE RACE

THE SPORTS PARADE

FLEAGLE AND COCHRAN SET NEW RECORDS IN MEET SATURDAY

By CASKIE NORVELL

In spite of the surprise defeat at the hands of N.C. State, the Davidson diamond aggregation is still on top
in the state championship race. Carolina's timely trouncing of Wake Forest did the trick. Davidson has a half-game lead over
the Deacons, with State, Duke, and Carolina trailing in the order named. This week the ’Cats go on a four-game
foreign invasion, which will bring them into contact with Lenoir-Rhyne and Hampden-Sydney, once each, and twice with the Gobblers of
V.P.I. Coach Lard’s proteges will return to their own back lot Friday to take on the much-talked-of Demon Deacons of
Wake Forest, who will present a strong team, with none other than Junie Barnes to do the mound work.

The editor regrets the errors in the batting averages and wishes to assure members of the team it was a
staff error, made by one uninitiated in the art of baseball scoring, who actually counted in the walks as times
at bat. In the future, the editor will take care of that column personally and promises no further mistakes.

Davidson’s freshman ball club hits the road this week for a four-game campaign. Games are booked with the Louisburg College
nine, and freshman teams from Carolina, State, and Wake Forest. Unger’s boys came out of a slump and have knocked
off three victims in a row and look plenty good. That Jenkins lad turned in a three-hit game against Charlotte
High.

Yours truly, ye editor, in addition to the rest of the college, takes this opportunity to say “nice going” to
Fred Fleagle and Miller Cochran, who set new college records in the 220-yard dash at 21.6, and 134 feet in
the discus, respectively, in the meet with South Carolina Saturday. Fleagle broke Currie’s record of long standing by one-fifth of
a second. Earle Frazier, freshman miler, stepped out in the meet with the P.C. neophytes and ran a mile in
4:36.9, to not only better the Davidson varsity record but to shatter the South Carolina state record in this event.
He also took first in the 880-yard run.

Davidson’s golf team broke even in a series of matches played away from home last week, dropping matches to W.
& L. and William and Mary, while winning over N.C. State and the strong University of Richmond linksmen. Wagner, through
absences, will be lost to the team for the rest of the year. The varsity tennis team followed two severe
trouncings by Carolina and Navy by winning three straight last week. The victims were Washington and Lee, William and Mary,
and The Citadel. The last-named match marked the return to the team of Johnny Lafferty, who has not been able
to participate in the other matches on account of an overabundance of cuts.

Inter-fraternity ball has gotten under way with Sigma Phi Epsilon defeating the S.A.E. boys in the first game, and the
Pi Kappa Alpha team knocking off the Betas in the only other game played to date. In the race for
the inter-fraternity athletic trophy, Beta Theta Pi is tied with the Pi K.A.’s for first place.

Charlie Harris’ return to the baseball team will greatly strengthen the pitching staff. Charlie cut church too many times and
has been on restrictions, which kept him off the last trip. Shrimp Morris is also on restrictions but is due
to be off Saturday. In the meantime, Bruce Peabody, slugging left-fielder, is holding down first base in great shape.

WILDCATS DEFEAT TARHEELS

N.C. State Wolfpack Nine Rallies to Defeat ’Cats 9 to 6 in Big Five Fray

Baily, West, and Pearce Used on Mound to Check State Onslaught

SEITZ STATE HURLER

Davidson Leads by Four-Run Margin Until Fourth Inning

It took the Wolfpack of N.C. State to upset the dopesters and hand the Davidson Wildcats their first licking by
a college team this season. State came from behind in a game played in Raleigh last Wednesday to defeat the
’Cats, 9 to 6. As the fourth canto opened, Davidson enjoyed a 6 to 2 lead, with Baily on the
mound. However, State scored seven runs in the next three innings, one of these being a home run by Duke,
who hit for the circuit with the sacks loaded in the sixth. The four markers brought in by this blow
proved to be the margin of victory for the East Raleigh team.

The ’Cats used three hurlers in an attempt to halt the State onslaught, while Seitz went the route for the
Techmen.

The inter-fraternity baseball series started off with a bang last week. The series was started with a game between the
S.P.E.’s and the S.A.E.’s. The second game was between the Pi K.A.’s and the Betas. The S.P.E’s beat the S.A.E’s
by a score of 22 to 11, in a seven-inning game, but the S.A.E.’s fought hard all the way through.
The game was featured by home runs by Clark, Cely, and Mixon of the losers.

My Greatest Thrill AS TOLD BY FRED FLEAGLE

My greatest thrill came in this year’s game with Wofford. I was playing halfback when the signals called for a
line sneak, and the first thing I knew the offense had cleared Wofford’s players from the field, and I was
able to carry the ball forty-seven yards that stood between Davidson and a touchdown. As this was on the second
play, it came as a surprise to me, furnishing my greatest thrill in football. Fred Fleagle, fleet halfback, is a
senior and captain of the Davidson track team, the century and the furlong being his specialties. In the recent Davidson-South
Carolina encounter he set a new college record in the 220, at 21.6 seconds. He made his letter in football
this year. With this statement by Fred Fleagle, this column comes to a close until next year, when “The Davidsonian”
hopes to publish a similar series of statements from such titans of the gridiron as Charlie Rives, Eb Willson, Percy
McElrath, and others of the Junior class who make varsity letters.

VARSITY ON TRIP

Davidson's varsity baseball team left Tuesday morning for Virginia where it meets Hampden-Sydney and V.P.I.

GAME AT CHAPEL HILL

First Two Encounters Won by Scores of 4 to 3

The Davidson Wildcats made a clean sweep of their three-game series with the Tar Heel diamondmen of the University of
North Carolina by winning the final game at Chapel Hill last Tuesday afternoon, 8 to 7. In two previous encounters
the ’Cats came out on top with 4 to 3 scores. The Wildcats were outhit fifteen to fourteen, and used
three pitchers to Carolina’s two, but bunched their hits in the pinches to win. Julian West, who relieved Pearce in
the sixth, got credit for winning the ball game. Carolina opened strong, and held a 3 to 0 lead as
the fourth rack opened, but the Davidson sluggers got into action and scored four runs in this inning to go
into a lead, never to be headed again. Powell, Tar Heel third baseman, had a perfect day at bat, singling
three out of three. J. G. Morrison led Davidson's sluggers with three for four. Line-up and summary:
