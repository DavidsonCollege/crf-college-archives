Every Tuesday night, twenty-one-year-olds have something to look forward to: twenty-one-year-old night in the 900 Room of the Union. This night can provide a relaxing environment very different from the normal court party.

Twenty-One-Year-Old Night

Twenty-one-year-old night produces a setting where alcohol can be used as an enhancement and not as a focal point. Students, staff, faculty, and former faculty members come to the Union on Tuesday nights from 10:30 to 1:00. These 21-year-olds can sample beer from around the world in bottles, a domestic beer on tap, or the free soda and popcorn which is always supplied. People often play games of spades or hearts or simply sit around and talk to each other. Senior Jamal Jones believes that 21-year-old night produces a “quiet laid back atmosphere, which is not centered exclusively around alcohol.” Senior Eleanor Hatcher says that the event “improves [her] quality of life.”

The History

The 900 Room bar had been open six nights a week when the legal drinking age was still 18. The drinking age was first changed to 19 in 1983, and William Brown, Union Director, had to change the rules to fit the laws of the state. Pitchers of beer were not allowed on the table once the drinking age went up to 19, but people under 19 were still allowed in the 900 Room. By the fall of 1986, the drinking age had gone up again to 21, which forced the Union to change its rules again. The Union decided to wait until the second semester, the spring of 1987, to unveil the 21-year-old night, because Brown did not know if there would be enough people of age in the fall. Until three years ago, the Union held just two 21-year-old nights in the fall, because Brown did not know if there were enough people to support the event, and he wanted to make it special. However, the success of the night caused the Union to change to every Tuesday night.

The Reaction

Brown found success immediately because the Senior class “enjoyed being together for the first time since freshman year.” Senior Ashley Atkins says that she likes 21-year-old night “because it is mostly a bunch of seniors.” Brown takes extreme pride in this night because of the “emphasis on conversation.” However, he was disappointed that the night had to be restricted, because it had belonged to everyone before the laws changed. Thus, he decided that no student activity tax could be spent at 21-year-old night because not everyone would have the opportunity to enjoy it. When asked if he has ever gotten a negative reaction by teachers or administration to the night, Brown responds, “No.” He believes this is because the night has a definite starting and ending time and is totally within the law. Brown says he would love to provide this atmosphere for students under 21, but he is unable to do this. He will continue to look for a way this atmosphere could be repeated for the under-21 crowd. Rosie Molinary, an under-21 student, feels that going to 21-year-old night is the “coming of age of a Davidson College student.”

Focus on concentrations: Applied math, ethnic studies, and gender studies

By Beth Lindsey

Continued from last week.

Applied Mathematics

The applied mathematics concentration incorporates the math, physics, psychology, chemistry, economics, and anthropology departments under one study. Students have the option of selecting the natural science track or social science track. This concentration was a brainstorm of the math department as a whole. “I was asked to come up with a concentration in computer science, but I really felt that it couldn’t be done at that time. I could, however, structure an applied mathematics concentration centering on math and economics,” says Dr. Stephen Davis. The first graduating class with concentrators in applied mathematics was the class of 1991, which had two participants. The program has experienced steady growth each year, with ten or eleven graduating concentrators this year. “There is pretty much an even split between the two tracks,” says Davis. “The majority of participants are economics majors; however, we have some in chemistry, physics, math, history, and philosophy also.” “Besides the fact that some feel it really helps them in the job market or when applying to graduate school, I feel that it is healthier to have a greater understanding of math in respect to society, and this concentration certainly provides for this,” says Davis. Applications must be submitted in written form to the Applied Mathematics Advisory Committee by the last class day of the fall semester of the junior year. For more information on this concentration, contact Dr. Stephen Davis.### Ethnic Studies

As the newest concentration at Davidson—approved in April 1994—the ethnic studies concentration is in its first year. It was formed upon the expressed interest of the faculty, students, and Board of Trustees. Dr. Nancy Fairley was hired to aid in the formulation of this area of study. Says Fairley, “The concentration seeks to help students understand the contributions of three particular groups—African-Americans, Native Americans, and Latinos—both as integral groups and also as culturally distinct. Though we cannot guarantee to teach sensitivity to students, we can guarantee to introduce the critical thinking skills necessary to understand and evaluate issues of democracy and cultural pluralism.”

Fairley stresses the comparative study of ethnicity in this program as a necessary part of understanding the entire human experience. Its importance to education today lies in the issue of diversity being continuously raised. “It is so beneficial to have an academic curriculum inclusive of minority contributions and social issues that impact their lives. With the opportunity to study various segments of society comes the opportunity to learn about diversity as a whole.”

There are currently five students who have expressed an interest in the program, with one student majoring in Ethnic Studies through the Center for Interdisciplinary Studies. Applications must be turned in by the last day of the fall semester of the junior year, while any questions can be taken to Dr. Nancy Fairley.

### Gender Studies

The gender studies concentration, begun in 1989, was initiated by Dr. Mary Thornberry of the political science department, Dr. Sally McMillen of the history department, and Dr. Elizabeth Mills of the English department. Despite the large number of female participants, Mills says, “We strongly encourage males to participate in the program because the study is really on gender—both male and female. There are a good number of male faculty involved in the program, also.”

The program as a whole has experienced both an increased number of participants each year as well as an increased number of courses offered. There are 11 participants in this year’s graduating class ranging in majors from history, psychology, English, and anthropology to economics, political science, and philosophy. Mills says the concentration “is a signal to people beyond the school that students really had done a concentrated study in a particular area. Many of our students have moved onto further women’s studies. One has a graduate assistantship at UNC-Greensboro while another has a teaching assistant position at UNC-Chapel Hill—both emphasizing women’s issues in their studies. Yet another former gender studies concentrator here at Davidson is studying at the University of Maryland and is interested in the area of women and law.”

Applications for this concentration need to be submitted by the last day of the fall semester of the junior year. Any questions can be directed to Dr. Elizabeth Mills of the English department.

### Golf Course Graveyard Ghost Stories

The northern boundary of the college along the current Main Street. At this time each faculty member was given a free burial plot as a perk for teaching. The cemetery was considered a burying ground for the public as well. In 1913 Davidson College President Martin suggested that the burial lots be sold and the income used for the maintenance of the burial grounds. These lots went for $1 to $2 per foot. After half an hour, the school had sold over $1000 worth of lots.

In 1962 an endowment was raised for the cemetery as a result of the poor upkeep of the area.

### Who Lies in the Cemetery?

The cemetery is the resting place for nine mayors of the town of Davidson, ten Davidson College presidents and their children who died while they were in office, and 12 Davidson College students. Twenty-nine of those buried in the cemetery were Civil War soldiers, and one soldier fought in the Spanish-American War. During war times many men were buried in the Davidson College cemetery because there was no way to ship the corpses to their homes; at this time the railroad system had not reached Davidson.

### Stories of the Dead

Walter Lee Lingle, 1868-1956, was the eleventh president of Davidson College. Although his presidency coincided with the Great Depression, his tenure marked a period of significant growth for the college. He helped found Preyer Infirmary, Duke Dorm, and Grey Library.

Andrew Goetchius and a group of fellow students decided to go skating on a pond near Davidson in January of 1894. Goetchius ran upstairs to get his skates. While coming down the stairs, he fell over the railing to the floor below. He died two days later.

David Yonan, class of 1900, was a Davidson student from Persia. He drowned in the Catawba River while attempting to rescue others who had swum too far out.

William P. Williams became the first mayor of Davidson in 1879. At that time, the town was called Davidson College. Within ten days Williams changed the name of the town from Davidson College to Davidson.
