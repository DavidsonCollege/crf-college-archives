### THE DAVIDSONIAN NEWS
**MONDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1993**

Most fraternities live in fear of being off campus, but not FIJI.

**By Ashlyn Dannelly**

The Phi Gamma Delta house off campus remains a place of unknown mystery for most Davidson College students. But, according
to newly elected FIJI president Taylor Hartley, an increasing number of students have been riding the “Phi Gam Tram” to
parties this year.

#### The History

Many people assume that the Davidson FIJI chapter is located off campus because of drug-related offenses in the 1970s. But,
according to FIJI historian Towner Blackstock, this is not the case. FIJI built their house in the summer of 1972
as a response to the Trustees’ and then-college-president Sam Spencer’s decision to impose a self-selection system on fraternities. Instead of
folding as many of the fraternities did, FIJI, along with Sigma Phi Epsilon, opted to move off campus.

The Phi Gamma Delta’s built a house in the summer of 1972 with a loan from the national fraternity. That
house, which president Taylor Hartley describes as a “gray Pizza Hut,” still serves today as the FIJI house.

Drug problems emerged for the FIJI house in the late 70s and early 80s, as drug use increased on campus
with the college’s liberalization. As Blackstock says, the loss of such institutions as required chapel and required ROTC and the
emergence of the Code of Responsibility allowed a drug cult to emerge, as it did nationally. Finally, in 1982, the
national fraternity stepped in, forcing the resignation of about 30 brothers who refused to sign an anti-drug proclamation. That loss,
coupled with the graduation of about 25 brothers that year, caused an immediate decline in the strength of the house,
which in 1981, had claimed about 110 members, one-tenth of the Davidson College population.

FIJI barely held on until the fall of 1989, when 8 graduates assembled 14 freshmen to recolonize the house. The
Class of 1993 provided the backbone for the current brothers. According to Blackstock, “They saw the opportunity to basically start
their own fraternity and do it the way they wanted.”

#### The Advantages

The FIJI brothers seem to enjoy their small size. According to Taylor Hartley, “We like the fact that it’s small.
More people would always be better, but we have enough to get by.” There are currently 14 FIJI brothers, with
one additional person abroad. Also, the house will have nine pledges this spring. As Blackstock says, “We’re comfortable with our
small size. I’d rather have that than have 30 guys I didn’t know in the house.”

The house also revels in their off-campus status. The FIJI brothers have voted not to return to campus if there
is an opportunity to do so. The house does not have to pay rent since the national fraternity owns the
building, unlike the houses on Patterson Court, which are owned by the school. In fact, no other fraternity can move
into an off-campus house if the Faculty committee passes on it.

### Faculty Committee Passes on Its Own Statement of Purpose

*Continued from page 1*

Benjamin Klein serves as a faculty member. Together, their duty was to review and edit the Statement of Purpose, retaining
as much of the existing document as possible while working to make it more inclusive of the various people and
religions represented at Davidson.

According to McKelway, a religion professor, this was not an easy task. He says, “I now understand why the Nicene
Creed took so long to produce.”

Although the changes proposed by the committee were hard to come by, McKelway believes the effort was worth it, as
the revised document espouses “a more open and welcoming attitude” toward the wide range of people at Davidson. The revised
version has been reviewed by the Executive Committee of the Trustees and awaits approval from the whole board when they
meet in February. It is being circulated among faculty and students, and committee members are willing to listen to their
input.

At Wednesday’s forum, a majority of the debate revolved around the revised document’s second paragraph. The first two sentences of
this new paragraph read, “Davidson commits itself to a Christian tradition which recognizes God as the source...”of all truth and
finds in Jesus Christ the revelation of that God, a God bound by no church or creed. The loyalty of
the college thus extends beyond the Christian community to the whole human community and includes an openness to and respect
for the world’s various religious traditions.” These sentences are to replace the old statement’s claim that Davidson “sees Jesus Christ
as the central fact of history.” Some students feel that these two sentences contradict each other, emphasizing Christianity, yet following
with an affirmation of all religions. However, McKelway believes that acceptance of other beliefs is a natural result of Davidson’s
Christian heritage. He worries that, “if you don’t specify this, people assume otherwise,” labeling Davidson as an exclusively Christian school.
Others believe that the Statement of Purpose should not include any theological pronouncements at all, but should simply state Davidson’s
goals as an institution. Klein pointed out that the document’s importance extends beyond the highly debated second paragraph. He wants
to ensure that Davidson’s commitments to service and internationalism are expressed in the revised document. Some of this is reflected
in a new paragraph which states, “Davidson values diversity and seeks to be a community which recognizes the dignity and
inherent worth of every person.” According to SGA Senator Jennifer Humphrey, the crux of the struggle with the Statement of
Purpose is how to reconcile Davidson’s Presbyterian heritage with its current composition of faculty and students. According to McKelway, the
revised version was crafted in an effort to “be honest” about what Davidson stands for today. On February 4, the
Trustees will have the final say about just how honest they think this new statement is.

Zoning restrictions forced the Sig Ep’s back on campus. Since then, no fraternities have been allowed to set up house
in Davidson. Also because of those laws, if FIJI decided to move back on campus, then they would not be
allowed to move off again, creating a truly unique situation. According to Blackstock: “There’s no chance in hell that we
would ever come back on campus.” Hartley also sees an advantage in having parties off-campus. “You can go out there
and do what you want. There are no police hanging around bothering you.” Also, the “Phi Gam Tram,” posted in
front of Richardson dorm, takes party-goers to and from the house, so that people do not have to drive.

The House Itself
To get to the FIJI house at 832 Beatty Street, you take a right onto Main Street from Glasgow. You
then take a left at the caution light, crossing the railroad tracks, and the gray house is on your left.
No brothers actually live at the house, because it has no shower. The house consists of a large dance floor
and bar, with two bathrooms. There is also a foyer, couches, and a TV. Hartley sees an added safety factor
in that, unlike Patterson Court houses, the FIJI house has no balcony. In addition to being the site of their
parties, the brothers meet at the house to organize such worthwhile services as canned food drives and working with Project
Genesis in Charlotte.

The Increased Interest
As Hartley says: “I don’t know what happened, but more people have started coming to our parties this year and
last year.” The house has parties frequently, but only two or three per semester which are advertised for the entire
campus. Hartley explains this low number by saying that because of the small number of brothers, “parties are a lot
of work for us.” According to Hartley, "The house was pretty much rocking at their last party." In response to
the increased interest, the brothers are planning more parties.
