By W. M. MEANS

Paging Trader Horn, Abie’s Pawn Shop or Major Clark! Found at last, the apotheosis of trading expertness. He is none other than D. A. McLean, ‘40. “Gooly” began exercising his bargaining powers during his freshman year. The beginning of the narrative of the modern Trader Horn goes back to those embryonic months of the initiative year.

Begins Career

The start was made rather un-auspiciously just before Christmas vacation. McLean on one of his many tours to Charlotte purchased a bicycle for the unbelievable sum of eighteen dollars. At Christmas the proud owner made the long trip into the wilds of eastern North Carolina to his home in Pinehurst on the two-wheeled pavement pounder. After the return trip to school the cycle ran across John D. Allen, Davidson ‘37, who later spent a few days in Bonn with him.

TRADES ’CYCLE FOR CAR

Bonn, Germany — Dr. Henry Louis Smith, former president of Davidson College, who has been recently praised for his pioneer work in radiography in America, looks more proudly upon the part he played in bringing the World War to a close than upon this latest distinction, says the Greensboro Daily News in a Sunday feature article. Smith served Davidson College as professor and president before the war. He left Davidson to take the presidency of Washington and Lee University, which office he held when his idea which aided in peace originated.

Army Misinformed

By skillful work during the latter days of the European conflict, the Allies kept the German command successfully misinformed. They published tales which said that the city of New York had been successfully destroyed, that London was on the verge of surrender and that the French government had given up Paris. And so the German soldiers fought on, thinking that they were accomplishing the brilliant victories that their officers told of.

The Allies, however, realized that if propaganda could be spread over Germany that the termination of the war would be near. The National Security League offered a prize for the most logical plan to accomplish the feat. Dr. Smith’s Plan

Dr. Smith, who had been a professor of physics and meteorology while at Davidson, hit upon a plan which would do the work rapidly and inexpensively and effectively. He knew that the battle tide lay in the position across which blew the north temperate air drift which moved steadily across Germany and Austria-Hungary. Therefore he proposed that this air drift carry across the empire a multitude of small balloons timed to descend during the night. Although there were not many upperclassmen there to help, the freshmen fairly shook the symphony.

Elmore Holt introduced a new yell called the “Skyrocker Yell.” After a number of yells had been given, Bill Lolin and Dave Warden spoke for a few minutes. They said that the whole team would be fighting on Saturday against V. M. I.

South Carolina alumni of Davidson College will meet at the Columbia Hotel in Columbia for their annual meeting Saturday at 12:30. The occasion is the South Carolina-Davidson football game, which will be played at Melton Field in Columbia at 3 o’clock.
