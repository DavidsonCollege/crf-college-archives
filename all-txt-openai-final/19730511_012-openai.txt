... the summer," he said. "If Dean Terry can find 20, 30, or 40 people that want to eat at Random House we will be glad to have them. As far as the social part is concerned, every party we have at Random House is open," Branigan stated. Terry said, "I sent a letter to the president of the SPE on the fifth of February explaining the situation. If they have waited until now to do something about it, that's their fault." The Trustee directive and town zoning restrictions prevent the SPEs from serving meals at their house on Main Street. Asked about the possibility of losing Random House, Branigan said, "We will eat with the college dining service if we have to."your shelves to see if you have any books which should See Our Large Selec Reputation for 3 generations Of Jewelry 1h Ls LA LtLI SI OL Let MLOMTG Jewelers of t 241 N.

As for Williamson's talk, Kaylor thought that he identified the college and the church too closely. “I think that he would like to see a college like Davidson become a church. He speaks from a very conservative theological standpoint which is not particularly helpful in getting at the issues of the college in the present day,” added Kaylor. “The value of both speakers was that they wanted us to take seriously our Christian commitment,” Kaylor observed. “The question is what form it should take. They said that the form should remain constant, but I feel that our form should change even while our commitment stays the same,” said Kaylor. “It was a disappointing day for me,” he said. “I felt that both speakers were telling us to maintain the status quo they supposed existed here. I'm afraid the only thing they really did was to confirm the idea a large number of trustees hold, instead of challenging us to see things in a new perspective. I would hope, however, to have more opportunities to discuss this situation with the trustees,” Kaylor said. Philosophy Professor Earl MacCormac indicated that he was “very surprised to find both sides of the issue presented. “I agree that if all faculty members were non-Christian, it would be just as much a prohibition against discussing a position advocating the Christian faith as we have now a prohibition against tenured faculty members advocating an alternative to the Christian faith,” he said. “Too often Davidson College is viewed as if it were a church rather than as a church-related college where various points of view can be debated,” MacCormac asserted. “I do not believe that sincere Christians are so insecure that they are unwilling to meet the challenges of their critics and opponents,” he concluded. “Dr. Williamson gave an impressive deliverance of such an unpopular viewpoint and did it very forcibly,” was the comment of Spanish Professor Thomas Rogerson. “The man was aware that he was making an unpopular opinion, but he did it magnificently.” As to Dr. Fry's speech, Rogerson felt that he “couldn’t assimilate the man’s conclusions from his lecture.” Economics Professor C. Louise Nelson declined to comment on either of the two speakers, saying that it was a “controversial subject,” but added, “What we're trying to do is come up with approximate solutions to insoluble problems.” NOW There will be a meeting of the National Organization for Women (NOW) at 7 p.m. Sunday, May 13 in Perkins Auditorium. Featured will be a slide show detailing the history of the women’s movement and a discussion afterward. Everyone is welcome.
