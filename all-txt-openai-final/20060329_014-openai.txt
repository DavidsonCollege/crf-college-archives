The men’s and women’s track teams competed successfully this weekend in the Wake Forest Open and Clemson Relays, taking place on Mar. 24 and Mar. 25, respectively. While the women competed as a team at the Wake Forest Open, the men split their squad between the Open and the Clemson Relays. The men and women placed in the top 10 an amazing 12 times in the track and field events.

For the men at the Wake Forest Open, Ryan Hubbard ’08 led the team in various events. Hubbard placed fifth in the long jump, with a jump of 6.47 meters (21 feet, 2.75 inches). The sophomore trackster also recorded a team-best time in the 200 meter dash, crossing the line in 22.52, which earned him 11th place at the meet.

Other all-stars for the men’s team include co-captain David Ritchie ’07, who picked up a fourth place spot in the 400 meter hurdles with a season-best time of 54.8 seconds. Another top-10 finish came from the 4x400 medley relay, made up of Ritchie, another co-captain John Bialas ’07, Daniel Bragason ’09 and JinHan Justin Song ’09, who came in fifth when they crossed the line in 3:27.67.

On the field, Jim Walter ’07 earned a fourth place finish in the discus. He threw the discus 43.60 meters (143 feet), which beat his performance last meet by just under five feet.

The men who competed at the Clemson Relays also fared well. In the 4x1500 relay, the team of Douglas Noreen ’07, Sam Morris ’08, Lance Harden ’09 and Thad Sieracki ’09 set a new school record with a time of 16:39.06, which also earned them third place in the race.
