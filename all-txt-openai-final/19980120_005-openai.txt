THE NATIONSBANK/KEMP SCHOLARS PROGRAM AT DAVIDSON

Rising juniors and seniors at Davidson are encouraged to apply for the NationsBank/Kemp Scholars Program for 1998-1999. The program provides $3,000 in support of independent study, travel, and research.

NationsBank/Kemp Scholars work independently with faculty supervisors on a project of their own design throughout the year. In addition, they participate with supervising faculty in an interdisciplinary seminar which links their independent research projects in a meaningful way. They also are expected to utilize the following summer for internships, further research, and travel before writing a final report on their project.

The 1997-1998 scholars, their projects, and their supervising faculty are: Stephen Becker, “The European Union: Two Countries' Perspectives (Norway/Sweden)” (Dr. Ross); Caroline McGaughy, “The Impact of Economic Development on Indigenous Populations: The Case of the Pehuenche Indians in Chile” (Dr. Simpson); and Aylin Somersan, “Dimensions of German Reunification on the Road to Pan-Europeanism” (Dr. Ortmayer).

The selection committee for the NationsBank/Kemp Scholars Program consists of the Dean of Faculty/VPAA, the chair of the Department of Economics, the director of the Center for Interdisciplinary Studies, and a representative of NationsBank.

Applications are available in the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs (Chambers 116). Completed applications are due by May 1. For further information, contact the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs.
