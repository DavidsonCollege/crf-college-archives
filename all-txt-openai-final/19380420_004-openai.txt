Williams, Johnson Break Davidson Track Records Tennis Team Continues Its Long Winning Streak

DAVIDSONIAN WEDNESDAY, APRIL 20, 1938

Varsity Racketeers Beat Wake Forest, Wildcat Nine Beaten In Thriller By Duke Infield Aces Frosh Nine Beats Furman; Beats South Carolina in Thriller Varsity Wins Slugfest From N.C. State, and Elon

After losing, 7-1, to a strong Duke nine on Thursday, the 'Cats came back strong to take Furman and South Carolina on Friday and Saturday by 12-6 and 6-5 verdicts.

Facing the outstanding Blue Devils for the first time this season, the Davidsons were only able to get one base blow off Dave Smith, Duke speed-ball artist. This hit, a double by Joe Kellam in the second frame, scored Tubby Hand for the only Davidson tally. Crash Davis, the Devils’ star second baseman, twice stopped sizzling line drives by J. D. Hicks that were labeled for the outer gardens. Hugh Verner and Tubby Hand also made spectacular catches of fly-balls to the outfield.

The highlight of the game was the sensational plays pulled by both teams. “Crash” Davis, who incidentally is a former teammate of Hicks, Hand, and Rudisill, snagged two of Hicks’ drives that would have been certain hits. To even the score up, however, Hugh Verner twice made a shoe-string catch of one of the Devil drives that came his way, and later, Tubby Hand pulled a long hit down and turned several flips on the ground before the stands knew what was going on.

On Thursday the 'Cats journeyed to Furman, and aided by six runs in the wild and wooly second inning, defeated the Purple Hurricane 12-6. Fitzgerald, substitute catcher, had three for three at the box. Dizzy MacLean gave up ten hits but kept them well scattered.

On Saturday the team won a decisive victory over State in spite of a strong wind which made many shots uncontrollable. Kenney played his best tennis of the year, making many almost impossible shots. Frampton displayed good form while Reinhardt was as dependable as ever. Jones, playing steady tennis, won easily over his man.

Results: Singles—Tenney (D) lost to Dillin 6-4, 6-3; Kenney (D) over Speers 6-2, 6-3; Frampton (D) over Murray 6-3, 7-5; Reinhardt (D) over Smith 6-2, 6-3; Jones (D) over Boney 6-0, 6-2. Doubles—Tenney and Kenney (D) licked Dillin and Murray 6-2, 6-2; Hunter and Northeross (D) licked Boney and Speers 6-2, 6-2.

Davidson varsity golf team left Tuesday for Athens, Ga., to engage the University of Alabama.

Three Records Fall in Meet at Blacksburg

The Virginia Tech Gobblers defeated the Davidson College track team Saturday at Blacksburg by a score of 81-45 in a fast meet that featured the breaking of two Davidson records and one V.P.I. record. Bailey Williams heaved the discus to a new Davidson record, throwing it 138 feet, 10 inches to better the old record by 6 inches. Even though he was second to Shockey, Tech weight star, Shockey hurled the discus 143 feet, 10 inches to equal the college record set by Herman Lund in 1928. Also, Swede Johnson, blonde Davidson javelin thrower, won his event with a throw of 180 feet 8 1-2 inches, and bettered the former school record of 180 feet, 2 inches.

Summary: Shot—Davis (T) first, Crisp (D) second, Warden (D) third, distance 42 feet 6 inches. Mile—Dennis (T) first, Walker (D) second, Long (T) third, time, 4:37.5. 440—Mast (T) first, McAlpine (D) second, Hickman (D) third, time 50.1. Pole vault—Ellis (T) first, Demuro (T) second, Douglass (D) third, height 11 feet 6 inches. 100—Bishop (T) first, Baker (D) second, Birmingham (D) third, time 10.8. Discus—Shockey (T) first, Williams (D) second, Cameron (T) third, distance 143 feet 10 inches. 880—Eagar (T) first, Bishop (T) second, Hickman (D) third, time 1:59.7. High jump—Douglas (D) first, Ellis (T) and Black (D) tied for second, height 6 feet. 120 high hurdles—Barrow (D) and Bradshaw (T) tied for first, time 15.6.

Kittens Beat Freshmen

The freshman tennis team had a successful weekend where they lost to Carolina's freshmen 5-4 and defeated Elon 8-1. The strong Pika volleyball team cinched a vast majority of the remaining meets, and seems to be the crop of the season. If the 'Cats do take most of the remaining meets, they will more than equal the past Whigs as the best team in recent years and will give them a merry battle before the match is over.: qr ' miata) >para- ‘e ‘ Racers 3 ree shaw (T) tied for first )) splendid record made by last year’s y+. yn over Sproull ear Ings today in a team match inuDReDaras | mite phi Gare took Gver: WOnial nae THinecHeren tou thontine: cracks Es | ed for fi ay Harbin (1 edition ey Peal to) tion for the annual Southern [nter- |), ey) frase aad te ; pcm. third, time 17 flat. 220—Mast (T) i i St o-0.
