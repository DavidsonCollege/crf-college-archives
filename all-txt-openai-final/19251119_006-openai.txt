6 THE DAVIDSONIAN, NOVEMBER 19, 1925

Only one more game now and the 1925 season will have ended. It has been a successful season, despite the
fact that Carolina defeated Davidson, and it shall go down in history as one of the greatest. In fact, both
of the past two years have been great years for the Wildcats.

Sophomore Team Sweeps Thru Class Series to Championship

The Sophomore basketball team clinched the title of the class basketball tourney by defeating the Central Cafeteria 30-20. The Sophs
had defeated the Seniors, who were rated their strongest opponents, and the other classes have likewise been defeated in the
contests with them. Although the Sophs have not finished their schedule, their claim to the title is clear since their
lead is so great that they cannot be overhauled.

The Sophs showed their strength in their first game with the Seniors, whom they defeated. The Seniors were doped to
have the best team and were generally conceded to be the strongest contenders for the title. Previous to the game
with the Sophs, the Seniors had defeated the Juniors, while the Sophs had swamped the Fresh. This gave an insight
into the true strength of the Soph aggregation and they soon proved that they meant to be the champs by
decisively defeating all their opponents. The Fresh were walloped twice, the Juniors once, and the second game with the Seniors
proved to be their second defeat.

As a general thing, the Soph class wins the championship easily, and also in former years the second-year men have
proved their ability to lick the others. This is possibly due to the fact that none of the star players
on the Soph teams have had a chance to be claimed as varsity material and disqualified from playing in the
tournament.

Two Great Pep Meetings Precede Carolina Game

The two pep meetings preceding the Carolina game proved beyond question that the Wildcat spirit had suffered no decline. All
that is needed is someone to adequately voice the fighting tradition of the college and organize the loyalty and enthusiasm
of the student body.

Following the unfavorable showing of Davidson in the Hampden-Sidney game, which was not preceded by a pep meeting, some of
the members of the squad who had seen the great pep meeting before the Wake Forest game, requested Coach to
have pep meetings Wednesday and Thursday night preceding the Carolina clash.

The pep meeting on Wednesday night began at 7:00 o'clock with rousing cheers led by Monk and his assistants. Coach
Monk then introduced Professor Wachter, saying that he considered it a privilege and an honor to be allowed to introduce
him. He also said that Davidson owed him a great debt because of his work for athletics and his contribution
to the 1925 football team. He spoke by special request of the coaches. Professor Wachter asked the students to forget
him and listen for 20 minutes while he analyzed the various elements which brought about Davidson's showing in the Hampden-Sidney
game. His remarks were to the point and aroused great enthusiasm among all present. His parting thought was: “Let us
finish with Hampden-Sidney tonight and at tomorrow's pep meeting talk of the Wildcat spirit that will take possession of the
field at Carolina Saturday.”

The Thursday pep meeting was the greatest in the history of the college. Shearer Hall was unable to hold all
that wanted to be there. There were students on all the steps leading into the building. It was begun by
lusty cheers and the singing of “Old Davidson.” Professor Wachter again spoke. This time for an hour and by his
humor, the student body left the Hall with the spirit of do or die, which accounted for the spectacular showing
of the team which one sport writer characterized as the finest exhibition of football ever played on Emerson field.
