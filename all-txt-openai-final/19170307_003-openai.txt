A motion was introduced and carried that the Seniors and Juniors should hereafter not be excused from attendance before Senior and Junior oratorical exercises.

In the Eumenean Society Monday morning, one declamation and three orations were delivered. Morton gave an oration on “The Causes of the War;” McCloy, on “The Future Results of the War.” Orgain gave an oration on “Mexico.” The one declamation was by McGirt, “Regulus to the Carthaginians.”

REVIEW OF LAST ISSUE OF THE MAGAZINE

The recent issue of The Davidson College Magazine is by far the best of this term. The only thing lacking about the magazine is good, wholesome humor. The stories, essays, and poetry are above the average, but the tone of the magazine is decidedly too serious. This issue contains four poems, all of which are good, particularly Cumming’s poem on “The Ocean Beach.” The melody of the words is practically unbroken, and the pictures are clear and distinct. Chambliss closes his story, “The Lunatic,” and gives a striking illustration of what he believes would happen to a man who would try to apply moral law to every business. “Owing to the Weather,” by Love, is a story

L. S. PATTERSON, RepresentativeThat is decidedly worth reading, and shows a degree of talent very unusual in a Freshman. Although Howell, in “The Skeleton in the Closet,” oversteps the “classical writers” a little, his story is very interesting and well told. “Lagore and the Spirits of the East and West,” by J. W. S. Gilchvist, '14, is very interesting and instructive. Stone, in his contribution about the early days of the Phi Society, has added much to this issue of the magazine. Dr. Richards, in a convincing article, has shown clearly “The place of religion in the curriculum” to be one of great importance. “War Poems,” by S. R. Keesler, review some of the poetry produced by the European war, and show its powerful effect upon world literature. Hamilton, in “Tnisheen,” has written very entertainingly of the scenes of his childhood.

I BELIEVE
In Health.
In Fresh Air.
In Preventing Tuberculosis.

I AGREE
To keep some windows open in my home, day and night, summer and winter.
To keep my body in good general condition by eating simple, wholesome food—and thus save myself from getting tuberculosis.
To take plenty of sleep and rest.
To avoid spitting on sidewalks or floors, because disease is spread by spitting.
To get all the fresh air and sunshine and outdoor life that I can.
To try to have the windows opened often in the place in which I work.
To take at least ten deep breaths twice a day outdoors.
To try to get my friends and relatives to join the fight against tuberculosis and to observe these rules—Committee for the Prevention of Tuberculosis, Brooklyn.
