Emeka Erege, a 6 foot 4 swingman who will wear Wildcat red and black next season, led Long Island Lutheran to the New York Class A Federation state championship, the USA Today reported on March 24.

Erege, who committed to Davidson during the early signing period this winter, scored 25 points in a shocker over LaSalle of Manhattan, then the second-ranked high school team in the nation.

Next stop, Davidson.

“He’s been playing really well lately,” assistant coach Matt Matheny said Friday. “So we’re pretty excited about that.”

Erege and Brian Allenspach, a 6-10 forward also clad in red and black next season, could add to an already solid recruiting class. The coaching staff is currently still weighing its options for a third recruit, according to assistant Jason Zimmerman.

The late signing period begins Wednesday.

Split from page 16 golden chance to sweep the season series from their cross-county rivals. Davidson scored five in the second inning and three in the third to take an early 8-4 lead. But UNCC (15-13) plated four runs in the eighth to knot the game at 9-9, and scored the winning run on an Anderson Marvin wild pitch with no outs in the 11th. The teams combined for 19 runs (only 11 of which were earned), 26 hits, and eight errors. The loss spoiled a workmanlike effort by pitcher Jamie McDonald, who gave up five earned runs and struck out four in seven innings. Perhaps still feeling ill effects from Tuesday’s defeat, the Wildcats looked sluggish in the early going versus the Terriers, falling behind 6-2 after three. But the Wildcat bats then awoke — in a big way. Behind Gus Quattlebaum’s 11th home run of the season and a three-hit performance by Luke Goodwin, Davidson scored the game’s final 14 runs to register the blowout. Brad Edwards added two hits and three RBIs, Ben Brown two hits and two runs, and Marvin two RBIs. Mike DeSimone provided effective middle relief for starter Ricky Paugh, throwing four scoreless innings to record his first win of the season. HBP - Mastro and Zban by Bowers, Quattlebaum by Mills and Dunn. T - 2:25, A - 247. Hill. HR - Matan (7), Anderson (3). WP — McKay, 2-3. LP — Marvin, 1-2.

Belk hosts National Wheelchair Association tourney © Basketball By JASON PRINCE Davidsonian Correspondent Over Easter break, the top 16 youth wheelchair basketball teams in the country gathered at Belk Arena to vie for the 1997 National Wheelchair Basketball Association (NWBA) championship. Approximately 450 players (ages 19 and under), coaches, support personnel, and family members were in attendance for the three-day tournament sponsored by the Charlotte Institute of Rehabilitation and the Carolinas HealthCare System. While the majority of the field hailed from the midwestern United States, teams traveled from as far away as Los Angeles, Calif., and Albuquerque, N.M., in order to compete. Before reaching Davidson, each team had to finish either first or second in their regional competition. After 33 games, the fifth-seeded Kentwood Junior Pacers of Grand Rapids, Mich., defeated the Rollin’ Rebels with a CAWS of Munster, Ind., 57-40, to claim their second title in three years. “Involvement such as this teaches these kids to not look at themselves as disabled, but rather, as competitors,” explained Kentwood coach Lee Montgomery. “It’s important for them to realize that their wheelchairs don’t keep them from being equal.” The Junior Pacers were led by senior standout and tournament MVP Paul Schulte who racked up 26 points, 12 assists, 9 rebounds, and 8 steals in the championship game. Schulte has accepted a full scholarship to play for the defending national champion collegiate team at the University of Texas-Arlington next fall. “People tend to believe that being in a wheelchair is a disability, but it is really more of an ability,” stated Kentwood senior D.J. Corradin. “When people say that something can’t be done, we have the opportunity to go out on the court and show them that it can.” Bill Giduz
