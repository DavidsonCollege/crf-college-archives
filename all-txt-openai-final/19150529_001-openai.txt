The DAVIDSONIAN VOL 2.

Inspiring Sermons Delivered Sunday
Dr. Leyburn and Dr. Wilson Address Seniors and Y. M. C. A.

A few minutes before 11 o'clock Sunday morning, the graduating class, in caps and gowns, marched in procession from Shearer
Hall to the church for the Baccalaureate Sermon. The sermon was preached by Rev. E. R. Leyburn, D.D., pastor of
the First Presbyterian Church of Durham. He was introduced by Dr. C. M. Richards, in a few fitting words. Dr.
E. P. Davis ('73), of Greenville, led in prayer, after the reading of the Scripture. Dr. Leyburn's text was Matt.
25:21: “Well done thou good and faithful servant.” The theme was “The Successful Life, What It Is, and How It
Is to Be Attained?”

All of us wish the highest possible success in life, said Dr. Leyburn. We may differ widely as to what
constitutes success and how it is to be attained, but all desire success. Standing today at the end of your
college course, it is well, young men, to pause and ask: What then is success? What do we mean by
the successful life? This is the first question to settle.

Success in life does not necessarily mean making money. I could name scores of men and women who have made
the highest and truest success of life, but who lived and died at last in poverty. There are men who
have made money and have also made a complete failure of life as God looks at it, and as God
reckons success and failure. Not what we get, but what we become; not what we have but what we are;
not what we lay up for ourselves but what we lay out for God and our fellow men: these are
the things that really count in life.

Neither does making a success in life necessarily mean making a name for one’s self and getting the honors of
the world. Many of the world’s greatest and most truly successful men never held a public office and never saw
their names in a newspaper or magazine. I suppose there is hardly a man in America who has had more
printed about him in the last ten years and whose photograph has appeared oftener than Harry Thaw, and yet I
suppose there is hardly another man on our continent who has made a more complete and pitiable failure of his
life than he.

Neither does making a success in life mean the carrying out of the most cherished plans of life, and reaching
the goal we have set for ourselves. Moses never reached Canaan. General Lee had to surrender at Appomattox. Jack Johnson
and Jess Willard have reached the goal of their ambition, but they are not a success in life, for their
success depended upon the nearness with which they approached the brute. “Not failure but low aim is crime.”

What then is success? What is the successful life? It means fulfilling perfectly God’s plan and purpose for the life.
Being all God wants us to be, doing all God wants us to do. Talents have been committed to our
keeping. At the end of life's day, the reckoning will come. Each will be rewarded, not in proportion to what
was given him in the beginning, but in proportion to the use he has made of it. The man who
had received two talents received just as great a reward as the man who was given five talents because they
were equally faithful. Many of the world’s greatest men were men whom their fellows looked upon as one talent men,
who by their energy and zeal and en—

Reunion of Societies Feature Monday

DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N. C., MAY 29, 1915.

Seniors Hold Sway in Tuesday Program
Edmunds Orator—Gym Exhibit and Senior Orations in Morning—Class Concert Other Events.

The program for the second day of Commencement week, Monday, the 24th, included the gymnasium exhibit in the morning, the
concert given by the Davidson Orchestra and Glee Club in the afternoon, and the reunion of the two literary societies
at night. The distinctive literary event of the day was the address before the Eumenean and Philanthropic literary societies, in
Shearer Hall, by Prof. S. H. Edmunds, of Sumter, S. C., a loyal alumnus of the class of 1890. The
subject of his splendid practical address, delivered with ease and force, was “Some of Life's Graces and Virtues.”

The first of these which he pictured was “humor.” It has its place in every normal and healthy life. Wit
appeals to the intellect, humor to the emotions. Humor therefore never leaves a sting, while wit often does. Sarcasm is
a form of wit, which from its derived meaning shows its brutality, tearing the flesh. Humor is a saving sense
and therefore a needful quality in life. Professor Edmunds here told three stories of humor to test the audience’s possession
of this saving sense.

Pathos is a virtue and grace allied with humor. One who is truly humorous always has a pathetic sense. There
is no grace that yields a larger practical dividend than courtesy, the courtesy which comes from a kindliness of heart
and manifests itself in graces of gentility. Courtesy increases with greatness. Discourtesy arises from three things—a false belief in the
lack of time, in the want of thought, and the belief that courtesy means servility. Courtesy is nobility.

The mad rush after the almighty dollar and the consequent materialism has given this age the air of irreverence. It
is the duty of the school and the home to cultivate reverence. This can be done by teaching a sense
of reverence for parents, sacred things, for women, for one's superiors, for our bodies and finally for God.

The history of the world has been a series of quests, quests for power and riches, honor and pleasure. The
Holy Grail typifies the religious quest, the Holy Sepulchre, religious patriotism. The greatest of all quests is the search after
the unattainable, infinite truth. Finite truth, however, can be attained and manifests itself in sincerity, honor and civic righteousness.

The resultant of all these graces and virtues is manhood. To say that a man is a manly man is
the highest compliment that can be paid a man, unless it be to say that he is a gentleman. How
shall we attain these virtues? By grace and by work. Work makes us victorious. Labor, well directed, systematic and conscientious
alone surmounts all difficulties, and makes a man a gentleman of graces and virtues.

REUNIONS HELD.

Immediately afterProfessor Edmund's address, the societies retired to their respective halls, where the annual reunions were held. In the Eumenean
society, the Valedictory was delivered by Norman Johnson, of Atlanta, in an eloquent and earnest manner. Patton, of the Junior
class, responded with well-chosen words and delivered the diplomas of the society to the following men: W. A. McIlwaine, C.
M. Gibbs, Norman Johnson, Alfred Scarborough, M. A. Boggs, W. M. Shaw. (Continued on page 4)

Day Exercises Impressive.

Tuesday was filled almost to the last minute with different events, the meeting of the Board of Trustees and the
Senior Orations in the morning, the meeting of the Alumni Association and the Class Day Exercises in the afternoon, and
the Junior Oratorical Contest followed by the Alumni Reception at night.

MEETING OF THE TRUSTEES.

At the meeting of the Board of Trustees, Prof. W. W. Wood, B.A. and C.F. of the University of Virginia,
was elected to the chair of Associate Professor of Applied Mathematics which will be left vacant by Dr. Wunder next
Fall. It was decided to connect Shearer Hall with the central heating plant and to install steam heat in the
chemical laboratory. A residence for Dr. Arbuckle will be erected at once, and later, one for Dr. Sentelle. It was
also decided to pay the expenses of the trustees attending future meetings. A special resolution was also passed endorsing, in
hearty terms, THE Davidsonian, and a hearty stamp of approval was placed on the campaign for $100,000 now going on,
of which $67,000 has already been raised.

SENIOR ORATORICAL CONTEST.

This event opened the public program for the day. Prof. M. G. Fulton presided. After the invocation by Dr. B.
F. Wilson, and orchestral music, J. W. S. Gilchrist was introduced as the first speaker, his subject being "Kipling's Message."
In his speech, he made a careful analysis of the things for which Kipling stands. H. B. Overcash, third honor
man, spoke next, on "Conservation of Our Natural Resources." F. W. Price, second honor man, made a ringing speech on
"The Man Behind the Degree," voicing an appeal for an educational system that shall give to every man the proper
development, minimizing no side of his life. Alfred Scarborough made a forceful speech on "Americanism," pointing out the dangers that
beset it and urging that it be preserved inviolate. G. W. Gignilliat, first honor man, had as his subject "The
Thief," putting his oration in the form of an address to a jury sitting in judgment on a youthful human
wreck, calling attention to the causes of the youth's degradation. Norman Johnson spoke last on "America's New Slogan and Mission,"
making an eloquent presentation of America’s mission to show to the nations the path of heroic peace.

ANNOUNCEMENT OF DISTINCTIONS AND PRESENTATION OF TROPHIES AND MEDALS.

Immediately after the Senior Orations, Dr. T. W. Lingle announced the distinctions in scholarship for the past year and in
the case of the Senior class, for the four years: Mr. T. K. Currie then presented the athletic trophies, the
class football championship cup to the Junior and Sophomore teams, who had tied for the championship. The baseball cup went
to the Sophomore class, and the track cup to the Senior class, who had won it twice before. Dr. B.
F. Wilson next presented the medals, intercollegiate debater’s emblems, for the Clemson-Davidson debate to U. S. Alexander and C. H.
Rowan; for the Emory-Davidson debate, to F. W. Price and F. H. Smith; Fresh-Soph declaimer’s medals to L. A. Chambliss
(Eu.), and J. A. Thames. (Continued on page 4)

Wednesday Program Furnishes Climax

Dr. H. L. Smith Speaks---Degrees Conferred---Prizes Awarded.

The climax of the four-day program of Davidson's seventy-eighth Commencement was reached in the Commencement Day Exercises on Wednesday morning,
May 26. Dr. W. L. Lingle, on behalf of the Board of Trustees, reviewed in glowing terms the work of
the year completed, predicting larger and better work; President W. J. Martin announced that the campaign for $100,000 additional endowment
has resulted in pledges already secured amounting to $66,000; thirty-five Seniors received diplomas for having successfully completed their four years’
work; the day was one to arouse the enthusiasm and kindle the hopes of alumni, faculty, students, and friends.

The outstanding features of the formal exercises of the day were the academic procession, the annual literary address by Dr.
Henry Louis Smith, President of Washington and Lee University; the presentation of medals, prizes, and diplomas, and the salutatory and
valedictory, by F. W. Price and G. W. Gignilliat, the second and first honor men, respectively, of the graduating class.

ACADEMIC PROCESSION.

At 10:30 a.m. the academic procession formed between the Library Building and Shearer Hall. First marched the undergraduates, then the
alumni in order of classes, beginning with the ones most recently graduated. These parted into two rows just before Chambers,
through which the trustees, the graduating class, the speaker and president, and faculty members passed. Each of these bodies was
led by a marshal. The Seniors were led by Chief Marshal F. W. Price, and the Valedictorian, G. W. Gignilliat.
Riggs McConnell, the popular little mascot of the class, marched with the graduates, in cap and gown.

DR. SMITH’S ADDRESS.

After music and invocation, the salutatory was delivered by Price. To the Davidson that was and is, and is to
be, he welcomed all. It was wonderfully appropriate then that the Annual Commencement address should be delivered by Dr. Henry
Louis Smith, formerly President of Davidson and now President of Washington and Lee. The class of 1915 is the last
class which knew him as President of Davidson. As Dr. Smith expressed it, “It is the last class of my
adoption at Davidson.” Dr. Smith was introduced by Dr. Martin in words full of praise and feeling, warm, hearty and
generous, ringing with the note of strong friendship. (Continued on page 2)
