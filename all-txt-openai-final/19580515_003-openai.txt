**Sports All That**
By JIM HAMILTON

It’s been a good year in sports for Davidson College. If the won-lost record is considered (Davidson won 62 and
lost 62 regularly scheduled matches this year for a percentage of exactly .500), it would seem as if this year
has only been a fair one. But when one considers various individual performances, the picture brightens.

In football, the Wildcats, despite flu and mud, managed a 5-3 season. High spot of the season was the trouncing
of Wofford, at that time the top football power among the nation’s smaller schools. Individual stars, to mention a few,
were Captain Bill Price, All-Conference center, and the passing duo of Benson to Wall. Co-captain Dave Fagg, Tommy Peters Award
winner, shone at tackle.

Soccer, a relatively young sport at Davidson, gave its new fans plenty of thrills during the season, and its 4-5
record doesn’t indicate the brand of ball played. Claude Finney and Pete Andrews gained all-conference honors to lead the men
of the hard toe.

The season record for basketball wasn’t too impressive (9-15), but such stars as Semi Mintz, the nation’s leading foul shooter,
and freshman dead-eye Bill Shinn gave Cat fans hopes of greater things to come.

On the mat, Coach Parker’s boys completed the best wrestling season since 1935, winning five and losing three. And of
course, there was Westervelt, who grappled his second undefeated season and captured the conference title in his weight for the
second straight year.

The swimming record also was not spectacular (five won, five lost), but the young squad showed promise of greater things
to come. Sophomore Tom Smith missed a conference championship in the backstroke by about three-fifths of a second. Freshman Tom
Hudgins continually placed first in the distances, and another soph, John Scott, was a hard man to beat in the
breaststroke.

The tennis team, perpetually strong at Davidson, posted a 13-5 record, the best in several years. Besides that, they took
second place in the conference in the tourney at Williamsburg. Individual conference champions were Doug Orr in the number five
slot and Dick Hodel at six. Orr and Dave Pearsall won the number three doubles.

With the best golf team in years, Davidson tied George Washington for the conference title in Danville last week. This
represents a jump from the cellar to the top of the league in only three years. Bucky Dennis was conference
low man with a 145.

Baseball was another story in contrasts. The Cats climbed from a 6-14 record last year to 11-6 this year. Davidson,
which led the conference until the last two games, finished fourth in the league.

**Orr, Hodel, Pearsall Pace Davidson to Second Place**

By FINLEY LEE

Davidson's tennis team, led by Doug Orr, Dick Hodel, and Dave Pearsall, gained the runner-up position for the second consecutive
year in the conference tourney last week at Williamsburg. George Washington won the championship, winning six out of the nine
divisions.

Jim Tarr of George Washington was the big winner of the week, narrowly defeating Toby Perry of William and Mary
for the number one singles title. Dave Pearsall, Davidson’s number one man, played his finest tennis of the year before
bowing to Tarr in the semi-finals.

**POINDEXTER AND BROOME**

Davidson also gathered points in the number two and four divisions, where John Poindexter and Harry Broome, who both won
opening round matches, were defeated in the semi-finals. In the number three singles, Tom McCutchen went to the finals against
Sol Libowitz of George Washington, who defeated him after McCutchen had gained an early lead.

Doug Orr, a freshman, won the number five division, defeating Jim Whitehead of George Washington 10-8, 6-1 in a fine
match in the finals. Scrappy Dick Hodel took the sixth division, defeating towering Chuck Bowie 7-5, 6-3.

**DOUBLES**

In the doubles, George Washington was again the strongman, winning the number one and two divisions. But the Cats scored
in the third division as Orr and Pearsall topped Whitehead and Shorr in three sets. The pressure was on Pearsall,
down 4-5 in the third, with his serve coming up. Dave held serve and for all purposes, the match was
over after breaking their opponent's serve. Orr served the final game at love.

In the official team totals, George Washington was first with 36 points, Davidson second with 21, and Washington and Lee
third with 19.

**Tech Drops Cats to Fourth Place**

Davidson's dreams of Southern Conference glory faded Tuesday afternoon as the unheralded Virginia Tech Gobblers exploded for 31 runs in
two games to defeat the Wildcats in two crucial contests. The Wildcats were riding high in a first-place tie with
Richmond before Tuesday's game with a 7-2 conference record. Richmond's record was also 7-2. The double loss not only knocked
the Cats out of first place, it put them completely out of title contention down to fourth place. Davidson now
trails George Washington, which has a 5-2 record, and Citadel, who owns a 6-3 slate. Virginia Tech’s record is five
won and six lost.

The Wildcats' hopes rose briefly in the first game of the doubleheader when they scored five runs in the first
inning to take a 5-2 lead. Victim of the onslaught was Dave Kuhn, Tech starter, who contributed to the Cat
effort with six walks. The lead, however, was short-lived, as the Gobblers tallied two more in the bottom of the
second and added two more in the bottom of the fourth to take the lead, 6-5. They accounted for six
runs in the sixth.

Left-hander David Ludwig sent the Cats blinking as he hurled a nice three-hitter. Ludwig sent nine Wildcats to the bench
on strikeouts while walking only one.4-5 one. His teammates backed Ford while three wins and seven losses give the S.P.E.s
ninth place. The Sigma Nus have no wins and nine losses.

Kappa Sigma 4-6
Independents 0-6
Sigma Phi Epsilon 3-7
Sigma Alpha Epsilon 2-8
Pi Kappa Phi 2-8
Sigma Nu 0-9

Phi Gams Top Softball, Lee Wins In Tennis
By MAL MURCHISON

The standings now give the K.A.s a shaky hold on second place with an 8-2 record, with the Phi Delts
trailing close behind in third with an 8-3 record. The Phi Gams are way out in front in the current
interfraternity softball tournament. The Fijis added number eleven to their perfect record by easing over the Betas 19-6 on Tuesday.
They increased the lead to 7-5 in the fifth and then erupted.

In fourth place, the Phi Delts have won eight and lost four; the Betas and the Pikas are in a
tie for fifth place having won six and lost six. The Sigma Chis’ Lee Reiger combination will play the K.A.
team of Gayle and Redmond. The winner of these matches will play for the championship.

Cats In Conference Tourney
McBryde Stars In Track Meet
By PETE WYRICK

The 34th annual Southern Conference track meet, held May 9 and 10 at Richardson Field on Davidson’s recently renovated track,
saw William and Mary squeak by The Citadel for the conference championship. Davidson claimed one individual championship as Angus McBryde
took first place in the mile run. McBryde paced himself well, running in the fifth position for the first three
laps, then kicked the last half of the final lap to win in 4:26.3. His time, run on a track
which most participants considered “a little slow,” was only one second off last year’s winning mark.

Other finalists for the Wildcat track team were Chris Bremer in the high hurdles, Date Gramley and Dave Warden in
the shot and discus, John Huie in the high jump, and Al McKay in the 440. Gramley finished second in
the discus and fourth in the shot, Huie tied for third in the high jump, and Warden was fifth in
the discus. The mile relay team gained fifth place.

The Citadel, sparked by freshmen and sophomores, took an early lead and held it until the high jump, the next
to last event in the meet, was over. Then a record jump by Bob Storm of William and Mary brought
the Indians from behind to win their second straight championship. Storm’s leap of 6 feet, 3½ inches erased the old
mark of 6 feet, 3 inches held by Jack Moody of U.N.C., since 1947 when Carolina was a member of
the old Southern Conference.

The only other record to be broken was in the pole vault, where Dave Tork of West Virginia broke his
own record of 13 feet, 10½ inches, set in 1956. Tork’s vault was 14 feet ½ inch. The meet produced
no double winners, but Tork and teammate Ray Peterson took individual scoring honors with ten points apiece.

William and Mary amassed 47½ points in winning, followed closely by The Citadel which finished with 44. Other scores were:
Furman 31, West Virginia 29, V.P.I. 28½, V.M.I. 18, Davidson 16, Richmond 9, and Washington and Lee 2.

Athletic Banquet Wednesday Night

On Wednesday, May 21, the Davidson Athletic Banquet will be held in the Old Dining Hall of Chambers Building. This
banquet not only honors those boys who won letters and awards, but also all boys who participated on any intercollegiate
team. Coach Tom Scott will act as toastmaster of the ceremony, and each coach will make the presentations to the
members of his team.

Football Coach Dole will be first to announce his outstanding players. The Academic and Blocking trophies will also be given.
Others to be honored will be members of the cross country, swimming, basketball, tennis, golf, baseball, wrestling, rifle, soccer, and
track teams. Angus McBryde will be honored as the top Southern Conference miler, while Doug Orr and Dick Hodel will
receive awards for their contributions to the tennis team. Also winning recognition for outstanding achievements on the team will be
the doubles combination of Dave Pearsall and Orr. The medalists on the golf team will be given their awards.

The trophy for the outstanding Freshman athlete will be announced at the banquet. It was won last year by George
Hart, who won letters in both football and baseball as a freshman.

There will be no supper speaker.
