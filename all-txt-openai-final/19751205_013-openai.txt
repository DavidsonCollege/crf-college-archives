The Davidson basketball team opened its season this week with two games, beating Wofford on Monday and dropping a Southern Conference contest to Richmond on Wednesday.

The Wildcats completely dominated Wofford, coasting to a 110-81 victory. The Cats jumped out to a 13-2 lead in the first five minutes, capitalizing on a couple of Terrier turnovers and some fine outside shooting. The Terriers closed the gap to 13-8, but Davidson ran off 12 straight points. Midway through the first half the Cats led 27-11. Davidson's man-to-man defense kept the Terriers from maintaining any momentum for most of the half, but at the 2-minute mark the Cats’ lead had been whittled down to 12. At the intermission the score was Davidson 50, Wofford 37.

Davidson vs. Wofford

The Cats came storming out in the second half, opening up a 66-43 lead after four minutes. After that, the closest the Terriers could come was 17 points.

The Wildcats opened up near the end of the game to run the Terriers off the court 110-81. Freshman John Gerdy led all scorers with 23 points, followed by Eppa Rixey and Tom Dore with 16 each, Marvin Lively with 13, and Pat Hickert with 12. Lively and Jim Rice led the Cats in rebounding with 9 and 8 respectively.

On Wednesday, the Richmond Spiders invaded Johnston Gym for an important conference game. The Spiders survived a shaky start to take a 75-62 victory. With the score 4-4 after two minutes of play, the Cats outscored Richmond 14-8 to grab a six-point lead. The Spiders stormed back with 10 straight points to regain the lead they never relinquished.

The game was tied six times in the first half, the last time at 34-34. Richmond held a 35-34 advantage at intermission.

Richmond came out strong in the second half, opening up a 47-39 lead after four minutes. The Cats scored eight straight points in less than two minutes to tie the game, and Richmond called a time-out.

The Spiders went into a 1-3-1 zone defense and started taking advantage of their superior height, opening up a 57-47 lead. The closest the Cats could come the rest of the way was six points. The 1-3-1 zone gave Davidson many problems, forcing turnovers and making the Cats take poor percentage shots. Davidson’s defense kept the game close until the last minute, when the Spiders expanded a six-point lead into a 75-62 win.

Gerdy was again high man for the Cats with 24 points, and Rixey and Tom Jorgenson had 10 each. The Wildcats travel to St. John’s on Saturday, and open their Charlotte Coliseum schedule next Thursday against Baylor.

WDAV will broadcast Saturday’s game.
