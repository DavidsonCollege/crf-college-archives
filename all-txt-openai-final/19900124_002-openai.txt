**Roadblock permanent near Baker Sports Complex**

The road that runs in front of the Baker Sports Complex has been open for several weeks to help facilitate
the move from Johnson Gym. Maintenance Engineer Phillip Cashion says that access to this road is only temporary. Grover Meetze,
director of Facilities Planning, has called for that road to be blocked off at all times once the transition to
the new complex is complete.

**Admissions to lose Parker to CA school**

By CLAY WRIGHT

Assistant Dean of Admissions Savander Parker has decided to leave his position at Davidson in order to pursue further career
options as the Director of Student Affirmative Action at San Jose State University in California. His resignation takes effect January
31.

Parker explained that he loves Davidson's size and students, but his current position offers him little possibility for career advancement
or the responsibility and resources which will be available to him at San Jose State. Although visibly excited about the
move, Parker deeply regrets having to leave the students he met and befriended, many of whom were his early recruits.

Due to his sincere concern and personal, easy-going manner, Parker is extremely popular with those students who have had the
chance to meet him. Freshman Anthony Foxx described Parker as “genuinely interested in the future of every student.” Jana Player
said she has been impressed by his ability to “keep up relations with the students that are here” as opposed
to just those he is recruiting.

Parker has been a member of the college’s admissions team since 1988. He was responsible for the mid-Atlantic region in
Davidson’s admissions program and also sought to add to the diversity of the campus by actively recruiting minority students. No
replacement has yet been named.

**Phi Delt will stay despite low numbers**

By GARY WHEELER

Despite the fact that only a few freshmen self-selected Phi Delta Theta this winter, President Andy Hunt told The Davidsonian
recently that he does not expect Davidson’s chapter to fold next year. Hunt admits that Phi Delt’s junior class is
“virtually non-existent” (2 members), but also says that the fraternity’s total membership will not change drastically. Thirteen people self-selected Phi
Delta Theta this year, 7 freshmen and 6 sophomores. Hunt estimates that between 12 and 15 seniors will graduate this
year, leaving the fraternity with about 30 members for next year.

**Baku taken by Soviet troops; new Panama head to visit Washington**

By CAROL GATEWOOD and CAROLINE WILSON

**SOVIET UNION:** Violence continued in the Soviet republic of Azerbaijan, a site of ethnic unrest between Christian Armenians and the
Moslem Azerbaijani majority. On Saturday, Soviet troops broke through blockades and shot at Azerbaijani protesters. This was the first time
the Kremlin has used deadly force against Soviet citizens since last April, when troops opened fire on protesters in...Tbilisi, Georgia.
The Kremlin is now up against not only the Azerbaijan Popular Front, but also an Armenian paramilitary group. The violent
crackdown has resulted in criticism of the Soviet government by its own people and the governments of Turkey and Iran.
On Monday, ABC News reported that Soviet troops had lined up along the Iranian border to control the supposed transfer
of arms to Azerbaijani nationalists.

BULGARIA: Communists announced that they will hold a major party congress on January 30th as a result of recent protests
and demands by labor movements for a more open economy.

ROMANIA: The government cancelled the referendum previously scheduled for January 28 that would have outlawed the Communist party. Officials also
announced cuts might be made in the flow of electricity to some large industries.

POLAND: Last week, 35,000 coal miners went on strike to protest new government-imposed wage controls. The controls are part of
Poland’s new experiment in a “crash” economic plan and are expected to check current inflation at 500 percent. Polish families
can expect to have their total income reduced by 20 percent before improvements are seen in the economy.

CZECHOSLOVAKIA: The United States has given “most favored nation status” to Czechoslovakia. This means that Czechoslovakian goods can now be
sold in the U.S. and marks the first step in its move to participate in a market economy.

EAST GERMANY: Criminal investigations into protesters who raided the capital’s secret police headquarters last week were opened. East German leaders
said that the nation’s revolution must remain peaceful. In West Germany, leaders said that a freely-elected East German government must
join them in declaring German unity as their goal and indicated that treaties now being negotiated between the two countries
were intended to prepare for national unity. Egon Krenz, the Communist responsible for the opening of the Berlin Wall, was
expelled from the country on Monday.

PANAMA: Guillermo Endara, Panama’s new president, announced that he will travel to Washington “as soon as possible” to ask for
at least $240 million in economic aid. Part of this money will help rebuild homes in the poverty-stricken neighborhood of
El Chorillo that were destroyed in the U.S. invasion of Panama. Endara has not spoken with President Bush since December
20th, the first evening of the invasion which overthrew General Manuel Noriega. Endara faces severe employment problems and fears that
a guerrilla insurgency will develop if solutions are not offered soon. With this fear, Endara has proposed that the Fuerza
Publica (police force) be increased from 1,000 to 10,000 members. The Fuerza is mostly composed of former Noriega soldiers.

SOUTH AFRICA: At the three-day meeting of the African National Congress, Walter Sisulu urged the congress to “sound out” the
government on its eagerness to negotiate with them. The ANC’s “Harare Declaration” requests the release of Nelson Mandela, former leader
of the congress; the lifting of a ban on the ANC and other political opposition groups; and the withdrawal of
security forces from black South African townships. It also outlines stipulations for constitutional reform in South Africa. President Mugabe of
Zimbabwe claims to have received U.S. backing for the document. The interference of an outside force could stall negotiations and
the release of Mandela.

CHINA: Five hundred seventy-three people who were jailed during last year’s freedom demonstrations were released last week. Thousands remain in
prison.

OOPS! We apologize for leaving Sigma Alpha Epsilon’s 21-week off the article last week.
