One would think that after taking first and second places respectively in the Southern States championships, the Davidson women’s and
men’s swimming and diving teams would take a few weeks off. Yet one week later the ‘Cats were back in
the pool at the ECAC Swimming and Diving Championships.

On the women’s side, junior Mary Shell Brosche continued to shine for the ‘Cats as she has all season long.
Brosche took seventh in the 200-yard individual medley and fourth in the 200-yard backstroke. Brosche also teamed up with junior
Britta Toleman, and freshmen Starr Daniell and Kendra Berner to claim seventh place in the 400-yard medley relay. In the
200-yard medley, sophomore Elissa Weddle joined Brosche, Toleman, and Daniell to take third in the consolation race, while the team
of junior Rachel Horak, sophomore Sarah Wines, Weddle, and Berner took fourth in the consolations of the 200-yard freestyle relay.

Continuing the ‘Cats success in the relays, freshman Heidi Hester, Berner, freshman Leisa Rossello, and Brosche took sixth place overall
in the 800 freestyle relay, while Berner, Brosche, Weddle, and Wines took second in the consolations of the 400-yard freestyle
relay. Other standouts for the ‘Cats included Berner, who took fifth in the consolations of the 200-yard freestyle and seventh
in the consolations of the 100-yard freestyle. Also, Heidi Hester and Daniell took 13th and 14th places respectively in the
consolations of the 500-yard freestyle. Daniell also took sixth place overall in the 200-yard butterfly, while Hester claimed ninth in
the grueling 1650 freestyle. Finally, freshman Beth Summerlin won the consolation race of the 400-yard individual medley.

The men’s team also enjoyed a solid showing as they were led by the strong performances of sophomore Kurt Hirsekorn,
junior Terry Dolch, junior Scott Harper, and senior co-captain Jay Rosenquest who, in one of the last races in his
Davidson career, took tenth in the 800-yard freestyle. Hirsekorn took fifth in the final of the 200-yard breaststroke and earned
second in both the 200 and 400-yard individual medley consolations, while Dolch swam an impressive race to take second in
the consolations of the 100-yard backstroke. Harper claimed first place in the consolation round of the 200-yard butterfly.

Just as they did during the regular season, the men’s team swam extremely well in the relay events. Harper teamed
up with senior Michael McCabe, senior Bill Paterson, and freshman Michael Warner to take twelfth place overall in the 200-yard
freestyle relay. Also, Dolch, Hirsekorn, Harper, and Patterson earned an impressive sixth place finish in the 400-yard medley relay while
Dolch, Rosenquest, junior Mark Medendorp, and Patterson took seventh in the 200-yard medley relay. Finally, sophomore Matt West joined Harper,
Patterson, and McCabe to take a first-place consolation showing in the 400-yard freestyle relay.

The Lady ‘Cats notched a 9th-place finish at the ECAC’s while their male counterparts finished with a strong 8th.

Davidson Doubles Classic:
Davidson 1 UNCC 2
Davidson 2 JMU 2
Davidson 2 Wofford 2

In a day dedicated solely to doubles matches, the ‘Cats split contests against both James Madison University and Wofford while
falling to East Tennessee State. Versus JMU, the #1 team of seniors Dana Casner and Amber Bradford lost a hard-fought
pro-set 8-6 while the second-seeded duo of freshman Forbes Thompson and senior Kirstyn Leuner lost 8-3. The #3 seeded team
of freshman Elizabeth Moreno and senior Claire Cheatwood and #4 seeds senior Clara Marks and sophomore Brenna Tindall won their
matches 8-5 and 8-6 respectively to salvage an overall 2-2 tie for the ‘Cats.

Davidson also earned a 2-2 tie against Wofford but this time the #1 and #2 seeds won their matches. Casner
and Cheatwood teamed up to earn an impressive 8-1 victory while Marks and Thompson won 8-4. The teams of freshman
Kelly Cantrell and Tindall and freshman Whitney Boykin and Moreno both fell 8-4. Versus ETSU the senior-freshman duo of Leuner
and Thompson earned the ‘Cats lone victory 8-3. Casner-Bradford and Cheatwood-Marks fell 8-5 and 8-4 respectively.

Against UNCC, doubles play took a back seat to the singles as the ‘Cats won five of the six singles
matches en route to a 7-2 victory. The #2, 3, and 4 seeds of Amber Bradford, Claire Cheatwood, and Forbes
Thompson won their matches in two sets, while #1 seed Dana Casner needed three sets to defeat Alice Hansen of
UNCC. Also, Clara Marks won her match at the #6 position 7-6, 6-1.

Davidson 2 N.C. State 7
The match against N.C. State brought a not-so-welcome change of pace for the ‘Cats. Against a talented N.C. State squad
the ‘Cats could only manage two match wins as #1 Dana Casner earned a 6-4, 6-4 victory and the #3
doubles team of Clara Marks and Forbes Thompson won 8-2. Number two seed Amber Bradford fought to take her match
to a third set after dropping the first 6-1 but ultimately fell in a second-set tiebreaker seven points to five.

Davidson 7 Wofford 2
Davidson earned their first conference win of the season last Monday with a victory over Wofford. The 7-2 score is
deceptive as the ‘Cats were forced into several very close matches. At the #4 spot, Forbes Thompson dropped the first
set 6-2 but came storming back to claim the next two sets 6-4, 6-3. Also, #1 seed Dana Casner was
on her way to a possible marathon match after taking the first set 7-5, but her opponent was forced to
retire. Claire Cheatwood was also forced to play a tough 7-5 first set at the #3 spot, but the senior
raised her game a level to easily take the second 6-0. In possibly the hardest-fought match of the afternoon, Brenna
Tindall and Wofford’s Jennifer Simpson battled for three exhausting sets. Simpson took theFirst set by virtue of an 8-6 win
in the tiebreaker. Tindall came back strong in the second to win 6-4. In the third and deciding set, however,
Tindall fell 6-1. Number two Amber Bradford and #6 Clara Marks also won their matches 6-3, 6-2 and 6-2, 6-1
respectively. Heading into doubles play, the ‘Cats were up 4 matches to 2 and needed only one more victory to
seal the victory. They got three. The #1 team of Casner and Bradford easily won their match 8-3, while the
duos of Cheatwood-Moreno and Thompson-Leuner triumphed with identical 8-5 scores.

The men’s track team opened the outdoor portion of their 1999 season in chilly, overcast conditions Saturday at the annual
49er Classic at UNC-Charlotte. Many of the athletes ran and jumped exceptionally well, despite the weather and the long break
since their breakthrough indoor conference meet three weeks ago. Head Coach Gary Andrew reflected on Saturday’s meet: “This was the
best opening meet in many years and a great effort despite the cool conditions. We seem to have a different
mindset this year, and this was reflected in the number of strong performances overall.”

Roland Williams led all Wildcats in the sprints as he ran :11.56 in the 100m and :23.32 in the 200m.
Addam Marcotte ran second to Williams in the 100m (:11.71) and also sprinted to a :23.87 in the 200m. Stan
Baker ran a near-PR race in his 200m, blazing through to a :23.53, while also running one of his best
times ever in the 400m hurdles recording a :61.99. Distance standout Brent Ferrell tried his first ever 3000m steeplechase, running
well enough to place 3rd and record the school’s fourth-fastest time (9:39.83), while doubling-up in the 1500m with an excellent
time of 4:11.52. Freshman Jay Jahnes was just behind Ferrell, running his 1500m in a time of 4:13.57. Thomas McElveen
led all Cats in the 800m with a strong showing of 2:02.36, with freshman Paul Irwin second to McElveen in
a time of 2:02.53. David Vaughn made an impressive debut to the outdoor campaign in the 800m (2:05.56), while Victor
Talbird (2:10.01), Jonathan Fly (2:11.30), and Miles Harmon (2:17.53) also competed for the team.

Noesges kicked off the morning’s events in the javelin. Both threw strongly with lengths of 87’09” and 85’ respectively. Senior
sensation Jamilah Sawyer competed soon after in the 100m hurdles, placing 6th overall with a time of 15.20. Sawyer also
exhibited her speed in the 400m hurdles (1:12.72). Placing 9th and 14th overall, sophomores Smyth Bitter (4:51.49) and Clare Frey
(4:56.49) represented Davidson in the 1500m. Frey broke her personal best record by three seconds. Accompanying Bitter and Frey was
freshman Rhiannon Ollis (5:24.41) who also ran a strong race.

Albert & Gibson lead men’s track team at opener

The field events were well represented as junior Ade Artis (fresh off his 6th-place indoor conference finish) triple jumped 43’
1 3/4” to place 7th overall, and John Moore threw the javelin an impressive 134’ 2”. In one of the
strongest performances of the meet, senior Michael Albert posted a :51.61 in the 400m to place 12th overall. His time
also puts him among the conference leaders at this early stage of the season. Senior Karim Lawrence also ran the
400m, finishing in a time of :53.51. Freshman Dan Gibson continued his tear through the Wildcat record books, as he
ran an 8:41.56 for his 3000m Saturday, only .03 of a second off of Ferrell’s year-old record. This time put
Gibson in 6th place for the meet and proceeded to establish him as one of the conference’s best rookies. Pat
Burchett followed in strong suit, running 9:02.96 (a personal record and one of the school’s top ten fastest times). Scott
Hutchins and Joel Hanisek ran 10:07.63 and 11:15.38, respectively, to close out the team’s runners in that event.

The Wildcat relay teams provided for much excitement Saturday, with the 4x100m team running :44.97 earlier in the day. Addam
Marcotte, Michael Albert, Karim Lawrence, and Roland Williams joined together to record a 7th place finish for the team. The
men also sent three teams to compete in the 4x400m relay, with the team of Paul Irwin, Davey Bacon, Stan
Baker, and Michael Albert leading the way in 3:33.73. Bacon rebounded from a disappointing 1500m with a :52.4 split to
help the “A” team to a 4th place finish at the meet. The men compete next at the Wake Forest
Invitational this weekend.

Women’s track team kicks off outdoor season

Cold and misty weather conditions were not enough to hinder the women’s track and field team this weekend at the
UNC Charlotte 49er Classic. In front of a host of Davidson fans, the Wildcats raced with vigor and earned multiple
personal best performances against the stiff competition of Appalachian State, Wake Forest, Bucknell, Liberty, and NC State. The junior duo
of Yolanda Kirby and Kristy Noesges kicked off the morning’s events in the javelin. Both threw strongly with lengths of
87’09” and 85’ respectively. Senior sensation Jamilah Sawyer competed soon after in the 100m hurdles, placing 6th overall with a
time of 15.20. Sawyer also exhibited her speed in the 400m hurdles (1:12.72). Placing 9th and 14th overall, sophomores Smyth
Bitter (4:51.49) and Clare Frey (4:56.49) represented Davidson in the 1500m. Frey broke her personal best record by three seconds.
Accompanying Bitter and Frey was freshman Rhiannon Ollis (5:24.41) who also ran a strong race.

Next came the 3000m, in which seven Wildcats competed. Freshman Lucy Billingsley came in first for Davidson with a time
of 10:46.51 (9th overall). Also breaking the 12-minute barrier were freshman Hannah Grimes (11:27.24), senior Jenny Klotz (11:35.92), freshman Julia
Kudravetz (11:37.08), and co-captain Beth Brewster (11:59.22). Seniors Katie Lannon (12:02.84) and Ellen Runnels (12:27.80) also turned in impressive performances.
Six of the seven 3000m performances were personal bests. Also securing a personal best record was senior Tab Combs in
the 800m with a time of 2:19. Running 1:07.29, sophomore Machelle Mess had a strong showing in the 400m. Wrapping
up the day’s events was the 4x400m relay run by Sawyer, Ollis, Frey, and Bitter. All four had impressive quarter
splits with a combined time of 4:18.24. Coach Thomas Cason was pleased with the meet’s outcome, “It was a great
first outdoor meet. Despite cool weather conditions, everyone competed hard, and most had personal best performances. It was a strong
team showing.” The women’s team is looking forward to action this Friday and Saturday at the Wake Forest Spring Invitational.
