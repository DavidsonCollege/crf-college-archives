**Date For Room Drawings Still Under Postponement**

After almost a month-long postponement, there has still been no definite date set for drawings for rooms in the dormitories
next year. According to Mrs. Scottie Nicholls, director of student housing, the college administration has asked her not to proceed
with room drawing until there is a reasonable degree of assurance that there will be full occupancy in the dorms.

“I know of no other reason for the delay than the administration’s interest in full occupancy,” she said. “This is
rightfully so, since the college does need the money. This really is no change in policy, for we've always wanted
to fill as many spaces in the dorms as we could since empty spaces lose money for the college.”

Actually, Mrs. Nicholls emphasized, the current stress to fill all possible dormitory space is “off-center,” because we have always had
all the beds filled in the fall. This past fall is the only exception.” Mrs. Nicholls said that this past
fall saw 32 students who had signed up to live in the dorms either leave Davidson or move off campus
during the summer. “The unfilled space caused Dr. Spencer (Samuel R. Spencer, college president) concern, and he would like to
make sure that we're filled this year,” Mrs. Nicholls said. “Because of the financial situation, I can understand his concern,
too, because unfilled dormitory space costs the college money. This has always been my aim, though, and except for last
year I have always had the dorms filled in the fall,” Mrs. Nicholls said.

Mrs. Nicholls had tentatively planned to hold the room drawing on Monday through Thursday of next week, but was requested
by Dean of Students Will H. Terry to put it off for a short while longer. “Now I’m working on
the possibility that the drawing might be held on the week of May 17, but that’s not a definite date,”
Mrs. Nicholls said. “I’ve been told not to do anything about room assignments until the administration gives me the go-ahead.”

Mrs. Nicholls pointed out that all her office can do in order to assure full occupancy is to “operate on
numbers, and when you are using numbers like this there are many variables, such as summer marriages, the attrition rate,
and so on. I’ve been assured 315 freshmen will be here next year to fill the dorm space now reserved,”
she said. East, Cannon, and Watts have been reserved for next year's freshmen class already. Presently the first two floors
of Watts are occupied by upperclassmen, but the whole dorm will be filled with freshmen next year. East and Cannon
have been freshman dormitories for several years. “Traditionally I never have enough rooms at drawing time, so I have to
account for dorm drop-outs over the summer,” Mrs. Nicholls said.

**The Definitive Farce: A REVIEW**

By BILL GREEN

Hours later, and over a much-deserved beer, a cast member tossed out the suggestion that “Charley’s Aunt” may just be
“the definitive farce.” Perhaps the nicest thing about the Drama Department production is that Hodson Hall is so hungry for
the things this show does so well. The soundly experienced and unusually balanced cast forms the basis for physical slapstick
in reaction to the coincidences and inverses of a Well Made Play. Slapstick done well is unbeatable, and the movement
in “Charley’s Aunt” is the best of its kind at Davidson in at least three years. My own favorites are
a first act chase between the three young men, and a perfectly done and classic letter-snatching sequence. The play is
a natural vehicle for...

**Student Group Conducts Three Day Fast For Peace**

While peace protesters were arrested in record numbers in Washington this week, Davidson students demonstrated their support through passive activity
on campus Monday.Tuesday and Wednesday. The Davidson Peace Coalition initiated a three-day fast to demonstrate support for those in Washington
and to commemorate last year’s killings at Kent State and Jackson State Universities. Other activities during the week included the
coalition's vigil across the street from the post office on Tuesday and a sit-in organized by international student Ken Ozeki
on Monday. Spokesmen for the coalition placed the number of those fasting between 15 and 20, with many wearing black
armbands to signify their sympathy. The total number of fasters was well below the figures from last spring’s fast. The
vigil lasted from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. with an hour of silence observed from noon to 1 p.m. The
numbers were sparse, with one to eight students maintaining the vigil. The vigil was planned as a memorial to the
four students killed by Ohio National Guardsmen last spring at Kent State. The names of the four were written on
crosses and, along with a banner, made the backdrop for the vigil.

Ozeki’s sit-in in the main hall of Chambers attracted the largest number of participants. In four posters, Ozeki made his
appeal for the legal, non-violent protest of the Vietnam War and support of those in Washington. The number of demonstrators
in the Monday morning sit-in ranged as high as 15-20, with several administrators and faculty members joining in.

Economist Galbraith To Speak Here Monday

John Kenneth Galbraith, author of "The New Industrial State" and one of the world's foremost economists, will speak at Davidson
College Monday on "Foreign Policy: The Next Reform." His talk at 8:15 p.m. in Love Auditorium will be open to
the public. He will also speak informally at 4:00 p.m. in the College Union.

Galbraith is the Paul M. Warburg Professor of Economics at Harvard University and spent the first portion of the 1970-71
academic year as a fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge University, England. He holds a Ph.D. in economics from the University
of California and was a research fellow at Cambridge in 1937-38. During World War II, he was personally responsible for
organizing the wartime system of price control as Deputy Administrator of the Office of Price Administration. Later, he directed the
U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey and headed the Office of Economic Security Policy in the Department of State. During 1961-63, he
was President John F. Kennedy's ambassador for the U.S. to India. He has also been active in the Democratic party
as a campaign and economic adviser. He is the author of numerous books and articles and is an authority on
foreign policy and Indian painting as well as economics. His talk at Davidson will be supported by the Z. Smith
Reynolds Foundation Lectureship Fund, established at Davidson in 1961, and will be coordinated by the college economics department.

The particular talents of George Draughon shine in his roles as Babs and as Charley's bogus "aunt." His comedy timing
is precise, and his facial asides and use of personal effects (watch that gaudy fan) alone could carry any number
of scenes. Peter Lutken and Ken Jones are equally adept as Babs’ classmates. Jones’ lovesick stares and Lutken’s characteristically brisk
and superbly timed movements are outstanding. Their counterparts, the young women of the plot, are Cathy Ross and Martha Plott.
The girls are perhaps not consistently as sugary sweet and likable as one might have them, but their duet movements
(mirrored and simultaneous steps and glances) are some of the finest touches in the show. Dave Bradley and Scottie Nicholls
are convincing as Jack's (Lutken) father and the real aunt. Bradley, in particular, serves as a necessary, effective, and welcome
anchor for the cast’s antics by means of his relatively straight approach to his part. Cullum Rogers and Tim Timmons
regularly delight the audience in their handling of two more-or-less character roles. Rogers especially works well with comedy timing and
stage movements. Timmons produces one of the show’s most original characters and gets laudable comedy mileage from some dry Well
Made Play exposition.
