### RIS & LIVING

**MONDAY, APRIL 7, 1997**

Experienced fun of Frolics.

Without an opportunity, but it sure helps — especially with the event geared to wild abandon: the “Big Party” held
Friday on Richardson Field.

Providing musical accompaniment and the traditional amusement park test-your-strength hammer (to the big guy snickering at my score of five,
it wasn’t as easy as it looked), there were these enormous yellow plastic wonders like a velcro wall and boxing
ring. We're talking big. We’re talking inflatable. We’re talking mayhem.

What was actually the most impressive, though, were the scads of people on the field who were really and truly
frolicking. Sure, the pumps and pearls could still be found hedging the “track” (I use the term loosely), dodging frisbees
and water guns so as to not muss their coiffes or soil their crisp linen, but the majority of students
were getting down and dirty. No doubt the competitive drive blazed through more than a few keep-away players and lawn
dart fans, but the atmosphere remained one of relatively good-natured fun.

Other events during the weekend included the International Ball and a poetry reading on the Union patio Saturday afternoon where
students shared both published and personal poems.

Saturday night featured the Archers of Loaf playing in the 900 Room to a large, enthusiastic, head-bobbing crowd. Kudos to
those brave few who broke out of the bob.

And kudos, again, to all who made Spring Frolics happen — we may be able to frolic on our own,
but it’s not every day we can eat a snow cone while wearing a velcro suit.

The Intimate Performance Committee is generally known for bringing Davidson laid-back, acoustic-based music, but on Saturday night, Chapel Hill’s Archers
of Loaf delivered a more straight-ahead rocking show than Davidson has seen in a long time.

Prior to the show, guitarist and singer Eric Bachmann expressed concern over playing colleges, saying that the band is never
sure whether the crowd will just be confused or will actually get into the music. As things turned out Saturday
night, the crowd in the 900 Room was anxious to move to the high-energy set.

The Archers began their one-hour set mostly with material from their latest full-length, *All the Nations Airports*, from the dirge-like
“Distance Comes in Droves” to the more poppy “Scenic Pastures” and “Form and File.” By mid-set, they dipped into their
older songs such as “Nevermind the Enemy” and “Underdogs of Nipomo.” Toward the end of the concert, they even brought
out their live classics like “Plumbline” and the encore of “Web in Front” (which really got people moving) and “Slo-Worm.”

Throughout the show, the crowd matched the energy level of the band, bouncing to the rock songs and bobbing their
heads to the slower ones.

To help create their sound, the band used a variety of guitars with special “adjustments” such as different tunings and
strange stringing methods. They also employed a sampler to generate sound loops over their two-guitars-bass-and-drum setup. The music itself, the
exceptional quality did not go unnoticed. The Archers’ sound guy, Craig, even commented on how outstanding they sounded.

The Archers’ last stop on a mini-tour of the Carolinas before they play an 18-date Midwest tour, Saturday night’s concert
hopefully sent the group off feeling more confident that this crowd knows how to “get into” their music.
