A Davidsonian In Germany

(The following is an excerpt from a letter to a member of the local community from a 1955 Davidson graduate who is presently studying in Germany.—Ed.)

I know that you're interested in my opinion of the German women, but I’m afraid that I don’t have much data on the subject. The few that I've met and gotten to know very well have been nice enough and it’s interesting to try to break through the language barrier. But most of the German women don't dress well, are often untidy, and in general don’t look as good as the American women. Few of them wear lipstick and none wear nail polish. However, they're interesting enough to while the time away and make things pleasant, but I still prefer my gal in the States.

There are no American soldiers here, but there are about 15 American students here, so that it is hard to keep away from them, sometimes. I’m living in a Studentenheim with about 70 German and foreign, male and female students. It’s a lot of fun and I've gotten to know most of them very well, but I sometimes wonder when the German students study. It’s certainly not very apparent until they are preparing for final examinations.

In general, I find the German mentality very hard to understand and impossible to characterize. In spite of many apparent similarities and some American influence here, I have found them to be totally different and in polar contrast to the American culture. It has been and will continue to be, I'm sure, a very profitable year for me, both in relation to my studies and in relation to comparative culture and de-provincializing.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor:

One need only to look in one of our church magazines and one will see an advertisement to the effect, “Send your son to Davidson where a Christian atmosphere prevails.” But where is this Christian atmosphere? Is it in the Bible class where God’s Holy Word is taught to be filled with discrepancies, and where the faith of many promising young is destroyed so that they enter life’s mad race with little or no respect for religion? Or is this Christian atmosphere to be found in Religious Emphasis Week when we had a two-bit politician whom “that state to the north of us” repudiated in several elections, and two other speakers who told us that to be Christians we must be in favor of organized labor in the South and that we must integrate. Or possibly it is to be found in the seminar groups where we are told that the Bible is the Word of God only when one reads it and applies it to oneself. If this be true, then the Bible is on the level with the Koran and any other writing, no matter what its nature may be. Is this the Christian atmosphere which Davidson advertises?

A Science As Yet Undiscovered

Flying Saucer Phenomena No Hoax, Says Ex-Student

(George O. Fawcett was a student at Davidson in 1948. Published below are portions of a summary of his research into the so-called flying saucer phenomena which has mystified the world in recent years. Contrary to the official governmental releases on the matter, Fawcett feels that there definitely is concrete evidence for the existence of the saucers, and logical basis for various other unexplained happenings, which have other-worldly overtones.—Ed.)

A Science As Yet Undiscovered

Flying Saucer Phenomena No Hoax, Says Ex-Student

(George O. Fawcett was a student atand spraying objects. These investigations are located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base at Dayton, Ohio. Also, Fawcett says that the different varieties of both earthly and heavenly objects have made it very difficult for both civilian and military investigators to determine which are which. UFOs (Unidentified Flying Objects), the official Air Force name for the saucer phenomena, give further evidence of the following: (A) Intelligent Control, (B) Appearances in Periodic Cycles of Time, (C) Landings on Various Occasions in Recorded History, and (D) An Outer-Space Origin. He bases his beliefs on the following facts that support the case for the flying saucers:

First, Exhaustive Research Has disclosed records of sightings covering thousands of years. Second, astronomers have been seeing the saucers in space for hundreds of years. Third, case after case, with pilots’, scientists’, and astronomers’ statements that the saucers are controlled machines, with speeds and maneuvers beyond the power of any earth-made aircraft. Fourth, simultaneous radar and visual sightings and many other official and unofficial reports of solid objects behind the mysterious lights prove the objects are real. Fifth, countless photographs, movies, and sketches of identical objects seen all over the world in periodic cycles of time. (Fawcett has over 104 photos since 1941.) Sixth, the mother-ship reports of huge cigar-shaped crafts used to transport the smaller disks through outer space, tying it all together with the spaceship answer. Seventh, worldwide saucer landings, attempted landings, and contacts with the saucers and their occupants. (Fawcett has over 85 reports of landings since 1836 and says that landings reported in Europe in 1954 rivaled landings reported in the spring and summer of 1956, like they did in '44, '46, '48, '50, '52, and '54.)

It is quite possible, Fawcett believes, that many of the earthly saucers have been launched from those mysterious submarines sighted in recent years off the East and West coasts of the United States and other foreign countries. Those heavenly saucers could possibly be linked with the mysterious explosions, radio signals, canals and bridges, lights and flying objects, strange geometric shapes and clouds, and other moving bodies observed on the Moon, Mars, Venus, other planets, and nearby space throughout history and especially in the last dozen years. Whether or not these objects, both earthly and heavenly, will be friendly or not in future years will depend upon their point of origin and their purpose for appearing in the skies.

Other Phenomena

During his study of the saucer phenomena, Fawcett says his hobby ran into many other unusual phenomena, some of which could possibly be related someday. Among these many mysteries of the unknown world around us, he listed the following which he hoped future science would someday be able to explain, along with the saucer phenomena:

(1) The appearance of strange creatures on the face of this earth along with the Abominable Snowmen of the Himalayan Mountains, (2) Mysterious footprints and marks on the face of the earth, (3) The disappearances of people, ships, and planes from the face of the earth, (4) Glasspox, better known as the cracked windshield mystery, (5) The burrowing garden hose phenomena, (6) The appearance of strange sea monsters, (7) Bleeding and weeping of religious statues, (8) Falling substances from the skies (ore, wood, wheat, honey, fish, blood, stones, meat, frogs, metal, large ice blocks, cotton fiber, powdered milk, red rains, blue snows, the Angel Hair Phenomena), (9) The appearances of apparitions, visions, ghosts, (10) Mysterious fires and unusual airplane crashes, (11) Psychic phenomena such as extrasensory perception, mind reading, mental telepathy, precognition, (12) Unusual cattle and crop destruction, (13) Movements of large numbers of people and heavy objects from place to place, and (14) Fireballs and lights, explosions and earthquakes, tricks of nature, and certain legends throughout history.

Perhaps there is a “Science As Yet Undiscovered,” states Fawcett, that will someday be able to explain many of the unknown mysteries of today. Perhaps either modern-day science is not as good as it is cracked up to be, or we are living in a new age, an age of everyday miracles round about us. As a final conclusion, he summed up the world situation in view of recent happenings, as a possible solution to the unseen and unknown world around us by a verse or two taken from the Holy Bible. From St. Luke 21:25-27 where Jesus was telling of some of the signs of His coming again into the world— “And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars, and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity, the sea and the waves roaring; Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken. And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.” No one knows, but maybe even this event could come in the age in which we live at the present time, Fawcett concluded.

The University of Richmond Graduate School is offering six Williams Fellowships for the session 1956-57 to graduate students working toward the Master’s degree. The Williams Fellowships pay from $600 to $1200 each. They are available in the departments of Biology, Business Administration, Economics, English, History, Mathematics, and Sciences. The University of Pennsylvania has announced the offering of a number of fellowships and assistantships for graduate study during the academic year 1956-57. The awards carry stipends from $400 to $1,600 in addition to free tuition. A number of University Scholarships granting free tuition are also available.

The Northwestern University Graduate School is offering a number of University Fellowships and Scholarships carrying stipends respectively of $1,775 and $960. Teaching assistantships carrying compensation ranging from $900 to $1,300 a year plus tuition are also available. Completed applications for these awards must be filed before March 1, 1956, in the Office of the Graduate School, Room 215, Pearsons Hall, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL.

The University of Rochester's Center for the Study of Group Relations and the Department of Sociology have announced that several graduate assistantships and fellowships are available for work toward an M.A. degree in sociology. The stipends range from $600 to $1,500 plus tuition. Graduate scholarships in other departments of the University of Rochester are also available. Further information may be had from the Registrar of the Graduate School, University of Rochester, River Campus Station, Rochester 20, New York.

The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy has a graduate program of training for careers in the State Department, in the United Nations, and various international agencies. Enrollment is limited to fifty students. Several fellowships and scholarships are offered to students possessing outstanding personal and academic qualifications. Applications must be completed before February 15, 1956. Information and forms may be secured by writing to the Office of the Dean, The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University, Medford 55, Mass.

The Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Foundation is offering twenty fellowships for advanced professional training in rocket and jet propulsion engineering and flight structures. They are awarded for graduate study at the California Institute of Technology, Princeton University, and Columbia University.

The Admission Test for Graduate Study in Business, required for entrance by a number of graduate business schools or divisions throughout the country, will be offered on three dates during the coming year, according to Educational Testing Service, which prepares and administers the test. During 1955, many students took the test in partial satisfaction of admission requirements of graduate business schools which prescribed it. Among these institutions are the graduate business schools or divisions of the following universities: Carnegie Institute of Technology, Columbia University, Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Northwestern University, Rutgers University, Seton Hall University, Syracuse University, University of Chicago, University of Michigan, University of Pennsylvania, and Washington University (St. Louis). A candidate must make separate application for admission to each business school of his choice and should inquire of each whether it wishes him to take the Admission Test for Graduate Study in Business and when. Since many business schools select their entering classes in the spring preceding their entrance, candidates for admission to the 1956 classes are advised to offer the February test, if possible.

The Admission Test for Graduate Study in Business is not designed to test specific knowledge in specialized academic subjects. Normal undergraduate training should provide sufficient general knowledge to answer the test questions. Sample questions and information regarding registration for and administration of the test are given in a Bulletin of Information. The tests will be administered on February 2, April 14, and August 18 in 1956. Applications and fees must be filed with the Admission Test for Graduate Study in Business, Educational Testing Service, 20 Nassau Street, Princeton, New Jersey, at least two weeks before the testing date desired in order to allow ETS time to complete the necessary testing arrangements.

A civil service examination for Medical Biology Technician has been announced for filling positions paying from $2,960 to $4,525 a year in various Federal agencies in Washington, D.C., and vicinity. Most of the positions to be filled are in the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland; and in Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, and Food and Drug Administration, Washington, D.C. The examination includes the following specialized fields: Animal anatomy, bacteriology, cytology, general biology, hematology, parasitology, pharmacology, physiology, serology, and virus and rickettsia. No written test will be given. The basic requirement for qualification is appropriate technical experience in the field of biology; however, pertinent graduate or undergraduate college study averaging at least 5 semester hours per year in the biological sciences may be substituted for the experience required for positions paying up to $3,670 a year. Full details concerning the requirements are given in the examination announcement which may be obtained from college placement offices or from the U.S. Civil Service Commission, Washington, D.C. Applications for this examination will be accepted from students who expect to complete the courses necessary for qualification within 6 months of the date of filing applications. Applications will be accepted until further notice and must be filed with the Commission’s Washington office.

Opportunities to study or teach in France during 1956-57 are available to American graduate students, it was announced today by Kenneth Holland, President of the Institute of International Education, 1 East 67th Street, New York City. The French Government is offering approximately thirty university fellowships through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and forty teaching assistantships through the Ministry of Education. The fellowship awards are for students with definite academic projects or study plans. The assistantships afford language teaching experience and an opportunity to become better acquainted with France. Nominations of candidates for fellowships and assistantships will be made by a joint committee of French and American educators working in cooperation with the French Cultural Services and the Institute of International Education. Closing date for application is February 1, 1956.

The French Government awards are open to men and women preferably under 30 years of age. Applicants must be U.S. citizens. Other eligibility requirements are: a bachelor’s degree from an American college or university by the time of departure; good academic record; good knowledge of French; correct usage of English; good moral character, personality, and adaptability; and good health. Graduate fellowships are open to students in all fields of study. In the field of medicine, candidates must have the M.D. degree. Fellows study in French universities and other state institutions. These awards provide tuition and a modest maintenance. Since the number of supplementary travel grants is limited, applicants should be prepared to pay their own travel. Applicants for the French Government awards should apply to the United States Student Department of the Institute of International Education.
