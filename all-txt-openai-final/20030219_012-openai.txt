Hoops first place within reach with win at Ga. Southern

Bernard scores 20 as Wildcats rebound from ETSU loss with road win

By Matt Garfield, Editor

Davidson coach Bob McKillop says his team is at its best when its back is against the wall. That’s exactly where the Wildcats found themselves on Tuesday night at Georgia Southern, needing a victory to keep pace with ETSU for second place in the SoCon North Division.

Davidson delivered, pulling ahead with an early three-point barrage and holding on for an 85-76 win over the Eagles in Hanner Fieldhouse. Thanks to ETSU’s win over UNC Greensboro, the Wildcats remain tied for second place with the Bucs. A win against Appalachian State on Saturday could create a three-way tie with only two games left in the regular season.

Wayne Bernard led the way with 20 points and six rebounds. But it was his defense against Eagles’ guard Julius Jenkins—the conference’s leading scorer at 23 points per game—that may have been the key to the win. Jenkins was held to only nine points on 3-of-12 shooting, his lowest total of the season. He fouled out with seven minutes remaining, dealing a serious blow to Georgia Southern’s hopes for a comeback.

“I really challenged Wayne about his defensive match-up, and he responded,” said McKillop. “He came up big for us.”

Brendan Winters added 18 points for the Wildcats, while Conor Grace anchored the inside game with 14 points and 15 rebounds. The Wildcats shot 50.8 percent from the floor, and outrebounded GSU 46-30. They were even better in the first half, shooting 59.4 percent from the floor and hitting 10-of-17 three-pointers.

“Our shooting demonstration in the first half was extraordinary,” said McKillop. “You could see in the shoot-around today our guys felt good about the way they were shooting. When you make the number of threes we did in the first half, that sends a message.”

After Georgia Southern (13-11, 6-7) scored the first six points of the contest, Davidson (15-8, 9-4 Southern Conference) rattled off a 14-2 run to grab a 14-8 lead on a Winters basket with 14:11 to go in the period. The Eagles cut the deficit to three on a Jenkins trey with 5:59 left, but the Wildcats outscored GSU 18-9 to finish the half, hitting six three-pointers in that stretch, and take a 49-37 lead into the intermission.

The Wildcats extended the advantage to 17 at 59-42 on a Conor Grace trey with 17:09 left in the game before Terry Williams responded with two consecutive three-pointers to pull the Eagles within 11. Williams again pulled GSU to within 11 points at 65-54 with 11:31 to go on a jumper, but Davidson went on a quick 14-7 spurt to push its lead back to 18 with 8:36 to play. The Eagles fell behind 85-68 with 2:02 left in the contest before scoring the last eight points of the contest to provide the final margin.

Williams finished with a career-best 22 points on 7-12 shooting, while Jean Francois added 18 points.

Brendan Winters scored 18 points Tuesday.

East Tenn. St. 87 Davidson 72

Just one game after shooting 54 percent from the field and 75 percent from three-point range, the Davidson men’s basketball team struggled to find the bottom of the net, falling 87-72 to East Tennessee State at Belk Arena on Saturday evening. The Wildcats shot a season-low 33 percent from the field in their first home loss of the season.

Three ETSU freshmen led the charge for the Bucs. Ben Rhoda led the Bucs with a season-best 20 points, hitting 6-of-10 from the field. Also scoring a season-high was Brad Nuckles as he poured in 19 to go along with his team-high eight rebounds. Point guard Tim Smith also notched 19 points.

Freshman Brendan Winters led the Wildcats in scoring for the second game in a row, dropping 19 points, thanks to 3-of-5 from beyond the arc. He also added seven boards in the effort. Senior Wayne Bernard and freshman Jan Johnson also netted double figures, scoring 13 and 12, respectively.

The Wildcats struggled from the start, falling behind 14-2 in the first five minutes of the game. Davidson crawled back to within three points on a Bernard three-pointer, but theLone Wildcat three-pointer in the first half, at the 4:27 mark. Junior Terrell Ivory converted on a three-point play a minute later and the Buc advantage was only two. Davidson did not score for the remaining three minutes of the half. ETSU went on a 13-0 run to take a 41-26 lead into the locker room. Each team turned the ball over nine times in the first half, but the Bucs scored 14 points off Wildcat turnovers compared to only three by Davidson.

The Wildcats kept the game interesting in the final half, slowly cutting into the ETSU lead. Senior Peter Anderer made his return after missing nine games due to a broken hand and nailed a three-pointer that cut the Buccaneer advantage to four points, 73-69, with just over four minutes remaining. Davidson did not connect again from the field and turned the ball over four times in the final two minutes of play as ETSU ended the Wildcats’ 10-game home winning streak.

Prior to this game, Davidson had shot below 45 percent in only two conference games. The Bucs, meanwhile, connected on 50.8 percent from the floor, the second time in the past four games a Wildcat opponent has hit at least 50 percent. It had been more than two years since an opponent had shot 50 percent or better before Wofford drilled 54 percent on Feb.

Men’s Hoops Week Ahead

Saturday
Davidson at Appalachian State
1 p.m. Holmes Center
Boone, NC

Winning the North Division will be nearly impossible unless the Wildcats beat Appalachian State (17-7, 10-3) for a second time on Saturday. A win would put the Wildcats in first.

SCOUTING REPORT: The Mountaineers are 12-1 at home this season, suffering their only loss last Saturday to College of Charleston 108-96. Guard Shawn Hall is a wild but sometimes deadly shooter who averages 22 points per game.

TAKE THE BUS: The SGA is sponsoring a bus trip to Saturday’s game. The ride and game ticket cost $10. The bus will leave the Baker parking lot at 12:30 p.m. and return around 7 p.m. Sign up at the Union Information Desk or contact Francois Trappey at K7515.

Tuesday
Coll. of Charleston at Davidson
7 p.m. Belk Arena

Davidson and Charleston have created a nice rivalry since the Cougars joined the conference in 1996. It could get even better when the Wildcats join the South Division next year, meaning they’ll play Charleston twice every season. Davidson has won the last four meetings, including a 73-70 road win last year.

SCOUTING REPORT: Legendary head coach John Kresse retired after last season but the Cougars haven’t suffered at all. In fact, they may be even better. Former Virginia assistant Tom Herrion has guided Charleston to the league’s best record (21-5, 11-2), including marquee wins over Wyoming, Oklahoma State, and Villanova. Herrion dismissed forward Zeke Johnson and suspended two other players before Saturday’s game at Appalachian, but the Cougars still managed to win.
