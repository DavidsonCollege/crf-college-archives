**CONCERT.**  
The concert given last Saturday night by the Orchestra and Glee Club was certainly no disappointment to the large audience which gathered in Shearer Hall. It was probably the best entertainment that has been delivered by that organization for some time. The Orchestra was not as large as previously, due to so many of the members leaving college, yet their music was of high order and was a fine accompaniment to the splendid singing of the Glee Club. The entertainment began with the “Marseillaise,” sung by the Glee Club, followed by “Dixie,” with the display of a large American flag. This called forth long and vigorous applause. Instrumental pieces by the Orchestra alternated with solos, quartets, or choruses by the Glee Club throughout the program. The features of the evening were the singing of Fowle, and of the quartet; also the selections rendered by the mandolin quartet. Fowle’s solo, “Thou Art Like Unto a Lovely Flower,” was received with such delight that he was called back twice, giving as encores, “Joan of Arc” and “All the World Will be Jealous of Me.” The mandolin quartet was also much appreciated, playing a number of the latest popular airs. The quartet, “Jamie” Fowle, “Johnnie” Curry, “Turk” Shaw, and “Bessie” Shields, brought down the house and were uproariously encored several times. “Turk” seemed to be greatly tickled and enjoyed himself as much as anyone else. “There” and “They Go Wild, Simply Wild, Over Me,” were the favorites. The last number was “The Recessional,” which was sung well by the Glee Club. During intermission, the football “Ds” and “D.C.s” were awarded by Dr. Arbuckle, with appropriate speeches, to the intense stage-fright of the recipients.

**REVIEW FOOTBALL SEASON**  
(Continued from page 1)  
Davidson's loss to Tech 10-32 looked good tucked in between the shutouts Tech handed out to Penn and W. & L. 41 to 0. The fast heavy team of Virginia Tech nosed out a13-7 victory over Davidson. D. C. held a 7-6 lead until the last few minutes of play, when luck came to V. P. I.’s aid and enabled them to score a touchdown just before the last whistle. According to V. P. I.’s paper, the "Virginia Tech": “Davidson gave Tech her baptism of fire.” “In the first real game of the season Tech turned seeming defeat into glorious victory.”

When Davidson met V. M. I. in Charlotte, they met, for the first time during the season, a team with “no advantage in the waist-line.” A 23-7 victory tells the story of how Davidson tends to a team anything like her equal in weight. Furman lost to D. C. 28-7. On November 10, Davidson met Auburn in Atlanta. Davidson smashed the grand old dope to everlasting smithereens—outplaying and outthinking Auburn to the extent of 21-7. "Twas an affair of beef versus brains—but Davidson had the brain.” Wake Forest was “easy picking,” and Wofford, though fighting gamely, could not stop the “Wild Cats.” Clemson was the “Last Unfortunate” to meet Davidson. Coach Donahue, of Clemson, was unable to serve “Davidson scalps by the dozen—a la carte.” Instead, Coach Fetzer’s fighters gave Clemson a dose of “21-9 Soothing Syrup.” (We hope ‘twill soothe).

A clipping from the Atlanta Journal says of Davidson: “The team often loses but is never defeated.” "Tis the fighting team that when downed won't stay down.” Morgan Blake of Atlanta, said, “We desire here and now to claim the lightweight championship of the world for the Davidson Wild Cats. No team ever put together in these United States of the same weight as Coach Fetzer’s team could ever get the verdict over that flock of wild men from North Carolina.” —And we believe Mr. Blake.

Various and sundry reasons have been given for Davidson's successes. To save time and trouble—the real reason for our winning is named—Coach Bill Fetzer. Georgia Tech claims the best team in the U.S. Davidson claims the best coach—and is prepared to back up her claim. We firmly believe that if our “Coach Bill” had the material, coupled with the financial backing necessary, he could turn out a machine that would almost tear up the Hindenburg line, and make end runs to Berlin. We give due credit to our Red and Black fighters—but we give more credit to our Red and Black thinker—Coach Fetzer.
