DAVIDSON'S NEWS FOLLOWER — December 9, 2009

A Peek Inside the Post Office: The Yowl’s Holiday Letters

Dear Santa, I regret to inform you that I have been a negligibly naughty girl this year. I may or
may not have been caught as the leader of my college drug ring (too soon Ace??). Some accounts have reported
witnessing my involvement in a brawl outside a bar, and certain enemies of mine may or may not be attempting
to present me to the Honor Council due to my kleptomaniac tendencies when it comes to community bikes. (Fountain Walker
did NOT find a stash of them in my shower, and he also did NOT discover my octo-bong.)

In any case, I have several requests. All of these things can be found in any SkyMall catalog, in case
you want to send the reindeer early with your luggage and catch a U.S. Air flight to Charlotte. I would
like the garden statue of three ants carrying a gnome. I would also like the metal cuff bracelet shaped like
a very long dachshund. And also the Box of Applause, which I can open while closing my eyes and imagine
that I am winning a Grammy.

That is all. Oh, and I have prepared a VERY special treat for you when you reach my room, and
I must admit, it’s much tastier than cookies. (That’s what the Easter Bunny told his friends, anyway.)

Love, A.

Dear Santa, It’s Lil Wayne aka Lil Weezy aka Weezy F. Baby aka Young Mullah aka Young Money aka Birdman
Junior aka Mr. Carter aka Best Rapper Alive. All I want for Christmas is mad drugs and world peace. And
when I say mad drugs I mean a lot. I have been really good this year, I mean even Gwen
Stefani said she couldn’t doubt me. You can come chill at tha Carter too and we could hang out on
Christmas Eve. And if you don’t have time to get me drugs and world peace just drop the world peace.
Actually just go ahead and drop the world peace. Now that I think about it, it would probably just be
easier to get me cash money. All I want for Christmas is a milli in cash money.

Ya dig, Lil Wayne

Please enjoy the rest of the Yowl!
