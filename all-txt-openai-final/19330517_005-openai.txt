CAROLINA TAKES TRACK CARNIVAL AS WILDCATS WIN THIRD PLACE

Carolina made it thirteen straight when they bagged the recent state track championship. Duke pushed the Tar Heels, while Davidson and State, who finished third and fourth, respectively, were outclassed by the leaders. Fleagle, Davidson captain and star sprinter, was troubled with several ailments, which severely hampered his style. He placed in both dashes, however. Evans and Frazier were others on the sick list.

Grid Card Announced By Captain Pritchett

Captain Pritchett, Davidson's athletic director, has just made public the football schedule for next year. Two opponents not met in 1932 have been added, and two have been dropped. The teams dropped are Washington and Lee and Clemson. During the past year Davidson beat W. & L., 7-0, and tied Clemson, 7-7. Elon opens the season and appears on the ’Cat card after a year’s absence. In the last meeting, in 1931, the Wildcat eleven downed the Christians, 13-2. William and Mary, a school noted for strong teams, is the other new opponent. This game will be played at Williamsburg, Va. Carolina, William and Mary, Wofford, and Wake Forest will be met on foreign fields, while home games have been arranged with Elon, V. M. I., Duke, and The Citadel. The place of the game with N. C. State is still uncertain, but either the V. M. I. or Duke game will be held on Homecoming Day.

Nine new varsity records were set in this annual North Carolina track carnival, not to mention the mighty heave of the discus of over 152 feet by Milan Zori of Steubenville, Ohio, sensational N. C. State freshman. While prepping at Massanutten Military Academy, Zori threw the discus over 150 feet in the southern prep championships at Chapel Hill last season.

The Big Five baseball race swings back and forth with Davidson, Wake Forest, and N. C. State as the most potential contenders for the crown won by the Deacons last year. Davidson dropped a contest to the Dekes and took one from Duke’s Blue Devils to place themselves at the top of the column. Bruce Peabody was the hitting star of the trip to Duke and Wake, getting two for four in each game. Big Jim Morgan got four out of five tries off Junie Barnes, famous Wake Forest lefthander. Shrimp Morris likewise got on Barnes for three out of five.

The golf team closed its season with a meet with South Carolina, which the Davidson golfers won. The team on this southern tour was composed of Captain Tom Caldwell, Mac Manson, Bob Gregory, and Tom Bowles, playing in the order named. Jack Wagner and John Thompson were not able to make the trip. Our best congratulations to Jack Wagner anyhow. That long driving titan of the links entered the Southeastern open, and was tied for second at the end of the initial 36 holes of play, and even though he slipped on the last campaign, he turned in a 72-hole total of 317 to lead all amateur entries in the tourney.

With the recent victory over Wake Forest on the local courts, the tennis team brought a successful season to a close. They counted five victories out of eight starts. Jim Halverstadt, John Lafferty, Charlie Myers, Tee Thompson, Dudley Elvery, Bob Morrow, and Francis Scott composed the team. Myers was captain. Halverstadt and Myers distinguished themselves especially in the state tournament.

Inter-fraternity baseball is drawing to a close. The Kappa Sigs defeated the Phi Delta Theta nine, 10 to 2, to go into the semi-finals, where they will encounter Phi Gamma Delta for the right to meet the Pi K. A.’s in the finals. The Kappa Sigs won the title last year, beating the Pikas, 5 to 4, in the final game.

As athletics begin to come to a close for the year, we see the teams in retrospect, and Davidson has shown up splendidly. This is especially true of football, baseball, wrestling, track, and tennis. Although defeated more times than they were victorious, the Davidson golfers and basketeers showed the Davidson fight and the Wildcat tenacity, in addition to clean sports, and so together with all the other athletic teams, the student body, through this column, offers to all of you their sincerest thanks and congratulations.

Carolina Takes First In State Track Meet
Grabbing six first places in a meet where nine new records were established, the University of North Carolina track team won the state championship with a team score of 82½ points. Duke was second, Davidson third, and N. C. State fourth in the varsity meet with 63, 12½, and 6 points, respectively.

Davidson men who placed in the state meet were: Varsity—Fleagle, fourth in 100-yard dash and third in 220-yard dash; Gammon, tied for fourth in high jump; Cochran, third in shot put and fourth in discus; Gwynn, fourth in 880-yard run; McCallie, fourth in 220-low hurdles and fourth in 120-yard high hurdles; Pratt, third in 120-yard high hurdles, and Glasgow, fourth in 440-yard dash. Freshmen—Lee and Pittman tied for first and Dolan tied for third in pole vault; Merchant first in two-mile run; Evans third in 100-yard dash; Fraley fourth in 440-yard dash; Faison second in 220-yard dash, and Cathey second in 120-yard high hurdles.

Davidsonian Picks All-Star Baseball Team
The sports editor, along with information gleaned from various and sundry sources, has made public the team appearing elsewhere on this page, as his selection of an all-state baseball team. A full team, plus four pitchers, two right-handers, and two southpaws, make up the organization.

Wagner of Duke gets the call for catcher, over Hicks of Wake Forest and Whitley of Davidson, both veteran receivers. The infield is composed of Morris of Davidson on the initial sack, Bunting of the Deacons holding down second, Powell of Carolina in the hot corner, and Mills of Davidson at short. It was hard to leave off such players as Joyner, Wake Forest, and McQuage, State, at first; Weathers of Carolina on the keystone sack, and Mackorell of Davidson at third, but the boys picked just showed a little more of the stuff.

The pitchers were plentiful in this state, but four appeared to loom above the others. Wake Forest’s illustrious Junie Barnes, and Charlie Pearce, Davidson ace, looked like the state’s outstanding southpaws. Of the orthodox hurlers, Harris of Davidson and Griffith of Carolina get the choice. Men like Coombs of Duke, Andrews of Carolina, Baily of Davidson, and Seitz of State, are splendid pitchers, but the four named on the team delivered more goods.

Wildcat Nine Goes on Batting Spree to Completely Route Blue Devil Team

PEARCE HURLS WELL
Wagner of Duke, and Peabody and Mills, Davidson, Leading Hitters

Davidson’s Wildcats returned to the lead in the Big Five race by giving the Duke University Blue Devils a severe 9 to 3 shellacking in a game played last Friday in Durham. Charlie Pearce, stellar southpaw, did the twirling for the 'Cats, and with the exception of Wagner, had the Duke team at his mercy. He gave up but six hits. Wagner, Duke catcher, led the hitters, getting three hits out of four times up. He was followed by Mills and Peabody of Davidson, who secured two for four apiece. The Wildcats had their big inning in the eighth, when they jumped on Harkrader for four runs to virtually clinch the ball game.
