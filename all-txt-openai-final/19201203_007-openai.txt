both from the point of appearance and training. From the fact that no especial preparation was made for this inspection
and that during the regular drill period that day the inspector called the various companies from their scheduled work for
the purpose of inspecting their performance, this report speaks very highly for our unit, and confers no little credit on
the battalion commander, the company commanders, and their assistant officers and non-commissioned officers. This report of course is made with
the view in mind of the very small amount of training the battalion has had to date. The ultimate attainment
of any R.O.T.C. unit is to earn enough credits to allow its institution to be rated as a distinguished college,
an honor held by only a small proportion of the colleges maintaining R.O.T.C. units. Some of the criticisms and suggestions
made by the inspector will indicate in just what manner we at Davidson College must extend and improve to enable
us to win that honor.

Criticisms
1. Armory, best in this area.
2. Saluting particularly good.
3. Manual of arms good with the exception of a few stragglers.
4. Physical exercises, satisfactory.

Suggestions
1. Deem it necessary to have an indoor rifle range.
2. No college can distinguish unless they maintain:
(a) An assembly room capable of seating the entire unit, and available for this purpose.
(b) Out of doors rifle range for light charge ammunition, at least 200 yards long.
(c) A machine gun range of at least 1,000 inches.
(d) A pistol range of at least 50 yards.

The inspector has to date visited 32 schools and colleges, so has excellent material for his commendations and criticisms. He
also expressed a desire that as many as possible of the schools in this corps area make an especial effort
to attain distinguished ratings, he himself will put forth every effort to assist the various units in the attainment of
this honor.

SERG. W. T. JOHNSON RECEIVES WELL EARNED PROMOTION

First Sergeant William T. Johnson has been appointed a second lieutenant in the infantry. He will stay at Davidson as
a special assistant to Captain Hearn. His duties heretofore have been keeping the files and other stenographic work. Sergeant Ryan
will take his place at this. Lieutenant Johnson went down to Columbia several weeks ago to take the officers’ examination.
He was uncertain at the time of the outcome, and up till November 26 he heard nothing about it. On
that date his appointment from the War Department arrived and he donned his officer's uniform. Being uncertain about the appointment,
he had neither bars nor leather puttees on hand. He was able to borrow Sergeant Ryan’s bars as he was
an officer during the war. The leather puttees perplexed him until he thought of Major Rogers’ beautifully shined pair. Major
Rogers readily consented to loan his for the time being and the lieutenant was able to appear in all his
glory. Lieutenant Johnson is well liked by all who know him and his many friends in college and in town
rejoice with him in this honor that he has gained. Promotion usually comes to those who deserve it, and none
could deserve it more than Lieutenant Johnson, both for his work in the world war and his work here.

B. W. ROMEFELT NAMED (Continued from page 1)

their losing the last game of the year, and spoke with confidence in the future success of the Wildcats under
the direction of Romefelt, who was unanimously elected captain for the year 1921. Among those responding to toasts were Coach
Grey, who expressed his appreciation of the full work accomplished by this year’s squad and for the fine spirit of
all the men. Mac Richards represented the second string men, who deserve a great deal of credit for their continuous
hard work. Brady, who finishes his football career with this year’s team, and Faison who is looking forward to three
more years with the Davidson squad, made very fitting speeches. Dr. Douglas ably represented the faculty in a few well-chosen
remarks. Captain-elect Romefelt expressed his appreciation of the honor shown him and expressed his strong hopes for even a more
successful season for the Wildcats in 1921.
