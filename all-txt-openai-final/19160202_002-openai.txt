DR. THORNTON WHALING HEARD HERE ON SUNDAY

Dr. Thornton Whaling, President of Columbia Theological Seminary, spent the day here last Sunday, preaching at both morning and evening
services. In the morning he spoke on “Home Missions,” showing the influence of the United States upon the rest of
the world, the laxity of the Church toward Home Missions, and urging the young men of America to consider this
field as a life work. In the evening he spoke on “Hitting the Mark.” A single act can either hit
or miss the mark, and a life must either be a success or miss the mark in this world. Dr.
Whaling made an interesting address Sunday afternoon to the Ministerial Band.

MULLEN SPEAKS AT Y. M. C. A. MEETING

Students who attended the last Y. M. C. A. meeting enjoyed a splendid talk on “The College Man and His
Friendships.” L. A. Mullen, who made this talk, impressed upon us all the value of friends, especially during our college
days. He pointed out that we should be careful in the choice of our friends because friendships are so lasting.
He showed very clearly the attitude of friends toward each other, in times “when knighthood was in flower” and that
the same courageous spirit still exists between true friends today. He closed his talk with a double plea: first, to
the younger men who are just entering college, that they exercise great care in the selection of their friends, and
not be too hasty in forming such friendships; second, to the older men, that they remember their responsibility in making
friends of the younger men. W. G. Somerville, the president, announced that the various Mission

A FINANCIAL BOARD

Briefly stated, there seems to be imperative need for a committee of men who will have general oversight of the
student financial interests of the college. This committee should be composed of members selected for their general knowledge of business
methods and record, and for their knowledge of Davidson student activities. It would be the duty of this committee to
examine at regular intervals the books of student treasurers and managers, and in this way furnish protection both to the
men who are handling the money and affairs of students and to the students. Not only should their work be
that of auditing the accounts and giving advice to men already in these positions, but they should take a broader
view and help to install a uniform set of books in different organizations.

The crying need for a system of this kind does not mean that we now have intentional dishonesty. We do
not believe this to be true. But it does mean that through lack of experienced planning and lack of any
uniform records, there is much waste of money, effort, and efficiency in the handling of our student affairs. The men
who have in the past and who are now filling the places of treasurers and managers are the first to
recognize the need for this formation of a board of this nature. At the end of the fiscal year, carrying
the accounts through the entire twelve months, a condensed report of each organization should be in the hands of this
board and these reports combined and given to the students for their information.

We will appreciate your business.

Special invitation to all.
