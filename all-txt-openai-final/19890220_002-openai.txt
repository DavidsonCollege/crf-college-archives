**Davidson Habitat for Humanity issues annual report**

In an annual report issued last week, Habitat board members claimed success so far in rallying community support for their cause. The 1988 Habitat organized volunteers and raised money to build one single-family house and begin construction on another. Those two dwellings are being sold through no-interest loans to families who would otherwise not be able to afford homes in Davidson.

In 1988, board member Ed White led the Davidson Habitat effort to select three families from the 17 who submitted applications. The first home will be occupied soon by Brenda, Orlando, and Erica McCain. Carlos and Jill Lasanta and their children will occupy the second home, which is under construction; and Jesse and Marilyn Williamson and their children will occupy the third house, which will be built this summer.

**White-Smith Scholarship established**

William Anthony White Jr., Davidson class of 1952, and his wife, Elizabeth Smith White, have established a scholarship for study and internships abroad for needy students at Davidson. The White-Smith scholarship honors several generations of alumni descendants of Anthony White, class of 1847, and Samuel W. Smith, class of 1929. Over the next few years, the endowment for this scholarship will grow to approximately $150,000. The scholarship will be administered by the Dean Rusk Program in International Studies.

**Epilepsy support group**

On Tuesday, February 28, the Epilepsy Association of North Carolina will offer monthly community meetings for adults with epilepsy. The meetings will be held the fourth Tuesday of every month at the Charlotte office, 4801 East Independence Blvd., Suite 1000, from 7 to 8:15 p.m. Persons with epilepsy and their family members are encouraged to attend.

**AIDS, from page 1**

In order to help the campus on the problem of AIDS, the committee itself needs to be better educated. The committee seeks to learn more about AIDS at an AIDS Prevention Workshop that four student representatives will attend later this month at Tennessee State University. This two-day workshop will focus on swapping information between the various universities represented, and teaching the participants how to better educate others about AIDS. The Davidson representatives will hold a campus-wide assembly to discuss what they have learned when they return from the conference.

Kimmel also suggested sending a group of Davidson students and faculty to the University of Virginia this summer to attend a six-week intensive course on how to talk and teach about AIDS.

Junior Cackie Walters, who is currently organizing a Rusk House committee on AIDS, complains that the “campus is dangerously ignorant” about AIDS. Students need to take the problem into their own hands and do something about it.

One suggestion on how to protect Davidson against the AIDS virus is to install condom machines in the bathrooms of the dormitories. As Kimmel warned: “The more difficult it is to obtain condoms, the less frequently they will be used. Condoms ought to be freely available to all students, because besides education, they are the only way to stop the AIDS virus from spreading.”

Davidson Service Coordinator Caroline Craig urges the students to take action on this issue. If it is left for the school to propose, Craig stated, the idea will have to travel through many time-consuming channels before it gets approved, including the conservative Board of Trustees.

Action needs to be taken right away; we can’t afford to wait for years for the school to become accustomed to this radical idea. Students interested in this problem should bring the issue to the attention of the SGA, and work on raising the awareness of their peers. Petition sheets will be posted around campus to gain extra support. Many other universities have already adopted this idea.

These extreme measures are necessary. Although students will probably not suffer the effects of the disease while attending Davidson, Fulton points out that soon “people won’t be coming back to our alumni reunions because they have died of AIDS.”

While at Davidson, however, the students will not alter their lifestyles because they don’t have any symptoms of the disease, and the majority believe “it won’t happen to me.” The job of the AIDS Action Committee is to convince everyone at Davidson that AIDS is a problem that all must confront.

Anyone who is interested in joining the AIDS committee or in learning more about AIDS can attend the weekly meeting, every Tuesday at 5 p.m. The location of the meeting will be posted.
