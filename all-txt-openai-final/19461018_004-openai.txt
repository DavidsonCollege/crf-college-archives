FRAT COURT

Female Walker met Brother Dave in Raleigh. Brother Dave Beats and Little Dave at the game.

We hope that the building project is completed soon so Nancy and Dave, Jr., can be here. Brother Moore tested
his will power by staying at school this weekend. He says it will never happen again.

KAPPA ALPHA

Raleigh was the objective for most of the K.A.s last week. They went by various ways, but were on hand
for the big game. Brother Dick Baxter gave Brothers Shep Dunn and Joe Baxter a ride in his car, and
called on some old acquaintances eastward.

Pledge Brother Bill Barron is to be commended for arranging the round-trip bus, which carried a large number of Wildcat
rooters. It was like old home week in the Capital City, with Brothers Davis Thomas, ’42, Ben Turnage, ’42, Ben
Washburn, '43, and Jimmy Houston, ’46, turning up for the game.

But not all the Sigmas turned up. One we know of went just the opposite way. Who? Pledge Brother Quince
Adams toured over to Asheville to date a Univ. of S.C. co-ed.
