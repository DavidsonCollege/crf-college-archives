PRELIMINARIES FOR DEBATE WERE HELD JANUARY 25
Monday night, January 25, the preliminaries for the collegiate debates were held. In both societies there was exhibited by the debaters a great deal of competition and spirit. The societies were very well attended and the audience was appreciative of the efforts of the speakers. In the Philanthropic society, the affirmative was debated by Messrs. I. Shaw, Rowan, Cooper, Howland, Arrowood, and Ormand; and the negative by Messrs. Neal, Alexander, Thames, M. Morrison, and J. D. McLeod. Some exceptionally fine debates were heard. The judges were Dr. Harding, Dr. Lingle, and Dr. Gray. The four who were chosen to enter the finals were Messrs. Alexander, Rowan, Neal, and Cooper. In the Eumenean society the affirmative was upheld by Messrs. Scott, H. Smith, Gignilliat, Chambliss, and Bellingrath; the negative was upheld by Messrs. Patton, F. W. Price, Perry, and Hunter. Dr. J. M. Douglas, Dr. Arbuckle, and Dr. Sentelle, as judges, selected to enter the finals, Messrs. Smith, Chambliss, Patton, and Price. The speeches as a whole were splendid and did credit to both literary societies. There will undoubtedly be some debates well worth hearing in the finals which will be held in Shearer Hall, February 12. The eight men who were chosen from the societies will then speak.and from these the teams and alternates will be picked.

CAMPUS PICTURE TO PRESIDENT WILSON

The following extract is taken from a letter received from the J. P. Bell Company, of Lynchburg, Va.:

"It will be of interest to you to learn that recently our photographer made a considerable enlargement of one of the views of Davidson College and sent it to President Wilson. Mr. Wilson was pleased to acknowledge the picture in terms of appreciation, stating that it recalled to him many happy days."

President Wilson has many times shown that he has many pleasant memories of the days spent at Davidson.

STRONG ADDRESS AT Y. M. C. A.

The Y. M. C. A. last Thursday night enjoyed one of the strongest addresses ever given on the Hill. Dr. H. B. Arbuckle presented the subject of Voluntary Mission Study Classes, showing in a very forceful way the need of such mission classes in college. Dr. Arbuckle showed:

(1) The appeal of the fact of missions themselves and the fact that it is a man's work needing strong men.
(2) Mission study is one of the best antidotes against materialistic tendencies.
(3) A new breadth of vision given, an acquaintance with all phases of world work.
(4) Brings historic, political, and social problems before college men.
(5) The great opportunities and privileges of the college man in respect to missions.
(6) The appeal of the Saviour's love. Jesus sent out His disciples to others because of His love. Should we not do likewise? Do we wish to have a share in this work?

At the close of the meeting, the Mission Study Committee, under the leadership of Alfred Scarborough, made a thorough canvass of the dormitories. Mr. Scarborough announces that approximately 200 men have been enrolled in the mission study classes. The four courses this spring will be:
(1) The New Era in Asia,
(2) Present Forces in Negro Progress,
(3) The Decisive Hour of Christian Missions,
(4) The Challenge of the City.
