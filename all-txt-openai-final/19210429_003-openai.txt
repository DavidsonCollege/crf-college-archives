At the regular meeting last Saturday night the question, “Resolved, That German indemnity should be reduced by half,” was debated.
The affirmative, upheld by G. I. Roberts, A. C. Summers, and J. C. Ives, argued that the present indemnity is
unfair to the German people; that Germany is absolutely unable to pay as required by the terms of the treaty;
that if there is a bankrupt Germany there will also be a Bolshevistic Germany to deal with. The negative, upheld
by James McCutchen, H. M. Morris, and K. G. Tucker, argued that Germany can pay in full if we give
her time and open up trade relations with her; that this heavy indemnity is more than justified; and that Germany’s
war aims make it absolutely imperative that she be prevented from becoming dangerous again. The decision was two for the
negative.

The subject for the extemporaneous debate was announced, "Resolved, That Congress should pass a bill forbidding foreign publications in the
United States." The affirmative, upheld by F. W. Smith, argued that such a move would help American publications; that this
law would check useless publications and thus be an economy on paper. But Query, in opposition to this proposal, argued
that these publications were great factors in forwarding democracy of these people, and also that such a move would not
work with the present freedom of the press. Again the negative won the decision of the judges. Freeman closed the
program with an oration.

DEBATING TEAM LEAVES FOR MERCER STRUGGLE

The debating team composed of J. M. Tamlap and A. P. Ormond left Wednesday morning for Tifton, Ga., to engage
in a debate with the team from Mercer, composed of Messrs. Odom and Webb. Davidson is upholding the affirmative and
Mercer the negative of the query: "Resolved, That the U.S. should cancel all war debts made to the allies during
the great war.” Each speaker will be allowed 20 minutes, to be divided between the main argument and the rebuttal.
The contest will take place Friday at 8:30 p.m., in the auditorium of Coker College. Our debating team lost to
the Mercer team last year and Davidson hopes to meet with better success before the audience at Coker College on
this occasion.

FLORA MACDONALD LADIES TO GIVE CONCERT HERE

On the evening of May 6th, four ladies from Flora Macdonald College, of Red Springs, N. C., will give a
pleasing concert in Shearer Hall. The program will consist of vocal solos by Miss Fannie Foy, graduate in voice, accompanied
by Miss Bisner, of the music faculty; violin solos by Miss Jane Dickson Vardell, instructor in violin, and piano solos
by Miss Mary Poole. Such a program will find many of the students and townspeople on hand to enjoy the
delights that such a class of entertainment furnishes.

PRESS ASSOCIATION MEETS WITH LOCAL PUBLICATION

(Continued from page 1)

Mr. Julian S. Miller, of The Charlotte News, who was expected to address the Association, was held in Charlotte due
to the inclemency of the weather. Following Professor Currie, Mr. J. O. Faulkner, former editor of the Ring Tum Phi,
of Washington and Lee University, spoke. He made a very interesting and instructive talk on “The Outside and Inside of
a College Newspaper.” In his talk he discussed the makeup, divisions, symmetry, and positions of different heads in the paper.
Quite a bit of stress was laid upon the editorial section. In a college newspaper the editorial is a powerful
factor since it reproduces the feeling and spirit of the entire student body.student body. Hence it is seen that a
great responsibility rests upon the mouthpiece of the students. Mr. Faulkner closed his address by urging anyone talented in journalism
to follow this talent up, as journalism offers a very wide field. After a few announcements by Mr. Weathers, the
meeting was adjourned.

Reception.
Immediately upon the close of the meeting, an informal reception was held in the Bachelors’ hall, where the delegates were
the guests of the Sigma Upsilon Literary Society. Refreshments were served and a very enjoyable time was had by all
those present.

Saturday Sessions.
The North Carolina Collegiate Press Association held the second meeting of its convention here in the Phi hall at noon
on Saturday. At this meeting, Prof. E. J. Erwin addressed the delegates on "The Literary Magazine." Mr. Matthews spoke on
"Advertising." Jonathan Daniels, managing editor of The Tar Heel, of the University of North Carolina, spoke on “The Managing Editor’s
Job.” Philip Hettleman, business manager of the “Tar Heel,” spoke on the “Work of the Business Manager” and advanced a
plan for the interchange of advertising information among the members of the association. These addresses were followed by reports and
business, and a meeting of the executive committee.

Saturday afternoon, the delegates attended the Davidson-Citadel ball game as guests of the Athletic Association. At 7:00 p.m., all the
delegates enjoyed a banquet at Mrs. Brady’s. President Grey, Dr. Shewmake, and Dr. Landrine made short talks. The banquet was
followed by a business meeting and the election of new officers. The officers elected for the coming year are: President,
Miss Anne Cantrell, of N.C.C.W.; first vice president, Mr. Emeline Gororth, of N.C.C.W.; second vice president, Miss Sarah Jane, of
Salem; treasurer, Mr. J. J. Dray, of Elon.

RAIN PREVENTS TRACK MEET WITH A. & E. AT RALEIGH.
A. and E. didn’t win a single event in the recent meet in Raleigh! No, not a single event. Davidson
won every event that was won! Yes, the trouble was that it rained. It rained prominently the very morning before
the big meet, that no one else wanted to be present. All the track squad had finished warming up and
the first call for the low yard dash had just been sounded when the rain descended and the track was
a track no more, because it was made of nice red clay. It continued to rain that night, thus blasting
all hope of pulling the meet off the next morning. Coach Grey accordingly packed his cohorts into the next train
and “lit out” for Davidson. With no mishap except two sleepless nights, our disappointed Wildcat “cinder squad” reached Charlotte in
time to see the baseball game Saturday afternoon.

Doctor—Was it a new penny?
She—Yes.
Doctor—Then it ought to pass.

MAGAZINE OFFICERS FOR NEW YEAR ARE ELECTED
The new staff will publish its first edition about commencement time.

WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH GIRLS TODAY?
Craving for Excitement Due to Boredom
Participation in moonlight automobile rides, "close" dancing, and a craving for excitement do not by any means indicate that our
young folks are deliberately going to the bad. Often, particularly in small towns, it is all due to just a
plain lack of something better to do. So says the latest Y. W. C. A. movie, “The High Road,” based
on the experience of the Y. W. C. A. with girls in towns large and small. The movie clearly shows
how one girl who has the right ideas can influence the whole community away from the wrong kind of amusements,”
says Dr. Anna L. Brown, of the Bureau of Social Education which is releasing the film. “Give young people in
your town something better. Preaching, without offering a substitute, is a waste of time.”

In a typical town, the scene of the romance, girls with enthusiastic co-operation from the boys are shown getting away
from joy rides in the moonlight, late hours, and high heels, to the “High Road” of health, hikes, and outdoor
sports. The movie is available for showing in your town, at your community center or elsewhere. Address the Bureau of
Social Education, National Board, Y. W. C. A., 600 Lexington Avenue, N. Y. City.

The reports of the Billy Sunday meeting in Cincinnati and the Gypsy Smith meeting in Indianapolis might almost be interchanged.
In both places, the tabernacles are overcrowded every night, and the Gospel is preached with power and tenderness. A very
deep impression is being made in both places by these great evangelists.—Herald and Presbyter.
