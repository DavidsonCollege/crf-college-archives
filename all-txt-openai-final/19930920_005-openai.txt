P.E. 101 teaches good health and safety

By Wendy Lee

Freshmen are undergoing a six-week program, instituted last year, called Physical Education 101. Weekly sessions focusing on a variety of health and related issues are required by every freshman. The classes cover first aid, adult and infant-child CPR, sexuality, and alcoholism. Students are also informed about career planning, student health, and counseling services offered by Davidson. The classes not only inform students about important health concerns but also orient them to many of the services offered to students.

Ron Morrow, director of physical education, said the program began to a large extent because of the high demand for first aid classes. A collaborative effort to add other topics grew out of this demand, involving the Dean of Students Office, the Athletic Department, the Student Health Center, and the Career Services Center. Morrow also added that Davidson can become a better community if more people are trained in CPR.

Freshman Laura Seib said that the tour of the counseling center was of great benefit because without it, she would have been unaware of the counseling services offered to students. However, she noted schedule conflicts as a problem: “The class conflicts with other activities like flickerball games.”

Georgia Ringle, Davidson health educator who gives the presentation on human sexuality, noted that it is important to “get the students to think ahead and be responsible for themselves.” Morrow noted that while the program is now limited to freshmen, it may be opened to upperclassmen if demand is sufficient.

Programs include trips to the 3rd world

including an independent study, counting towards her Davidson biology major. Incorporated into the courses was scuba diving three times per week. This program housed only thirty students, two of whom were also Davidson juniors, Rod Carter and Bill Webb, along with three professors. The living conditions were “rugged” and with nowhere else to visit on the island, Heather called it “a unique bonding experience.”

Sam Knowles and Jimmy Stuart also experienced “bonding” as they lived and traveled together in Spain for the year. Deciding to take an entire year abroad, Sam chose Spain after visiting the country in high school. Instead of living in one city for the year, Sam and Jimmy lived with a family in Seville during the fall semester and then lived independently in Salamanca during the spring.

The World Expo was in Seville at the same time Sam and Jimmy lived in Seville. Visiting it, Sam recalled bungee jumping off the New Zealand exhibit. The pair was able to visit most of Spain during their year. Sam and Jimmy also toured Europe during a seven-week break between programs. While their Salamanca school involved a month-long orientation, the two were excused because of their earlier Seville experience. The timing was perfect to travel, Sam commented.

The Salamanca semester offered different characteristics than the Seville portion. In the spring, Sam and Jimmy lived alone and enjoyed their freedom. The courses they took were serious, Sam stated, yet the program coordinators realized the importance of cultural experiences as well. One such instance Sam remembered involved discrimination. On several occasions, not just in Spain, he recalled not being served or allowed in bars or restaurants because he was an American. New sentiments like discrimination became part of Sam’s education abroad.

Other students interested in creating their own study abroad programs have a unique source of funding in the Dean Rusk Center. Here a faculty advisory committee selects abroad applicants to whom they disperse the “rather unusual” program fund, according to director Jack Perry. In the past several years approximately $30,000 has been awarded to students interested in studying abroad in the summers.

While they never award a full scholarship, the funds allotted are based on the student's estimated coverage and costs. “Giving preference to unique, independent academic programs, the Dean Rusk fund encourages students to specify their interests. Students participating in the Davidson-in-Cambridge summer trip or Davidson’s summer semester in Mexico have also received funding from Dean Rusk in the past. In addition to the general fund which is based upon private donations, a separate Third World Medical Internship fund exists. The classes of 1984 and 1986 both donated their class gifts to Dean Rusk scholarship. Private donations comprise the core of funding for scholarship-based programs.

Students support speech code

STANFORD, Calif. (CPS) - Just over half of Stanford University seniors questioned in a recent poll said they support the university’s policy on free expression, and 80 percent said they do not feel that it hindered bringing up sensitive subjects in the classroom. Stanford adopted a policy entitled “Fundamental Standard Interpretation: Free Expression and Discriminatory Harassment” after concern mounted over racist incidents on campus. John Marr, who conducted the survey for his doctoral dissertation in educational administration at Ohio State University, mailed questionnaires to 1,269 Stanford seniors, or about 75 percent of the 1993 graduating class. “Although some respondents reported that they believe that the policy has contributed to some degree of self-censorship among students, many others reported positive benefits as a result of the policy,” Marr said. The 555 respondents reflected the racial composition of the class, he reported.

Flood survivors will feel stress

CARBONDALE, Ill. (CPS) - A college psychologist predicts that Midwest flood victims will have a tough readjustment when the glare of the media dims, support dwindles, and relief money and goods stop flowing in. “Emotional stress comes as part of being involved in an event,” said John F. Snyder, a psychologist from Southern Illinois University at Carbondale. “But afterward, when there’s nothing to be done anymore, you start seeing physiological symptoms—heart palpitations, dizziness, and so forth.” Snyder heads SIUC’s “Go-Out Team,” a group of psychology students who experience what disaster victims are going through by becoming a part of it. Snyder suggested that flood victims express their feelings and not lose their connections that come from family, friends, and churches.

Service with a smile

AUSTIN, Texas (CPS) - Texans apparently have a different style of helping new and returning students move into their dorms—at least at the University of Texas at Austin. President Robert Berdahl and about 300 other faculty and staff members participated in the “Mooov In” event in late August, officials said. The volunteers were stationed at four residence sites. As students and their parents drove up to move in, the volunteers assisted by carrying boxes, luggage, stereos, and other items into dorm rooms. A campus news release said the first-ever event was designed to give students an informal “Texas style” howdy. The “Mooov In” was named so because of the University of Texas’ mascot, the Longhorns.

Davidson covers the globe

Davidson’s Art History Department now offers three programs of study in Europe, alternating between England, France, and Italy each Spring. This Spring, Dr. Nina Serebrennikov will take Davidson students to Rome, studying art and architecture there, as well as throughout Italy. Last Spring, professor Shaw Smith led a similar trip to Paris. Next Spring, for the first time, Davidson students will travel to London, led by professor Larry Ligo. According to Dr. Ligo, the group will spend about half of their time in London, and the other half traveling in England, as well as spending three weeks in Paris. Davidson’s Art History programs in Europe began in 1976, and, according to Ligo, are very unique to offer this type of on-site study to their students. Finally, Davidson offers an annual summer program of study in Cambridge, England. Davidson’s wide variety of study abroad options contains something for nearly every student. More information on each of these programs can be obtained from their sponsoring departments, as well as from the Study Abroad Office.
