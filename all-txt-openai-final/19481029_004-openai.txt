to tell you who you can hire and fire. Dewey, as well as Truman and Wallace, stand for FEPC. If
we go Republican now, we will be "throwing our weight around" indiscriminately, whereas if we withhold our support from both
of the big parties until they come to appreciate our position, we will have regained our proportionate share of influence
in national affairs.

Though Thurmond cannot win, even if the South votes for him in a block, the 1952 major party conventions will
be anxiously courting our favor. As a temporary move, as a declaration of political independence, perhaps Southern voters would be
wise to go Dixiecrat November 2, NOT for an absurd "white supremacy" which millions of Southerners do not favor, but
against centralizing more power in Washington designated by the Constitution to the State and local governments.

Dewey, let us hope, will be the next president, but he does not need our vote, and if a vote
for Thurmond and Wright will help end our one-party system and make us independent voters, perhaps that would be the
wise thing to do. It is a difficult choice to make. Any conclusion, but decide and vote!

PHI DELTA THETA

Verifying the age-old adage that variety is the spice of life, the brothers and pledges of Phi Delta Theta diversified
themselves this past weekend in such a manner as to do credit to Don Juan himself. All Saturday morning there
was a feeling of expectancy, a very perceptible desire to be off. Many furtive glances at creeping timepieces, and already
readjusted ties and otherwise natty attire. Noticeably lacking at the house were the football fans, who usually listen to Carolina
romp over a hapless foe on Saturday afternoon. The Phi's were about the boarding house.

With the threat of a Queens invasion, a skeleton force of capable defenders was being prepared. The girls from Queens
arrived, and the Phi's were on hand to meet them. Regardless of cramped style, the situation was handled admirably, and
the general consensus of opinion could be printed in the Queens publications. The dissension was not with the dates but
more with the serpentine inclinations of certain stag brothers. Dill Montgomery led the wheeling, dealing aggregation by rocketing off to
Chapel Hill for an extended stay. How was the game, Monk Man? Brother Parker off to his old haunts, and
back with a sly grin. Brother Newell gone again as per usual. Jim Vann to Yadkin, etc. The game in
Spartanburg claimed numerous Phi's. The traveler for the Converse campus and belles, Wofford or the wine.

Since the present year of 1948 is considered a good one for the Broyles' call, the success of the Gazette
is due in large measure to the cooperation and interest of the students in his work, but it is easy
to see that the success of the Gazette is also because of the interest that Mr. Broyles has.AND MON. “ISN’T

Mebane, Kline, Campbell, Brother and Hy P. (Harse Us I to mention but a few. Could the question, “How the
week be best answered after Homecoming?” be influenced by the rush of feminine companionship? We will certainly be on hand
to see.

A few of the brothers spent the weekend in relative quietude to complete the divergence of recreational pursuits. But even
they had to howl, and picked the wee small hours to serenade Duke Dorm. An ominous flashlight dispersed the choristers
ere long. Brothers Knight and Hollister went to a movie, or movie Brother Turnipseed’s “euphoric spirit” upon his return to
the campus has long been a mystery. Did he spend a restful weekend, or did he receive some Chanel No.
5 scented inspiration?

The brothers treated the pledges to elegant after-night week end Phi well known Back Sunday come close to a few
of the brothers who were not victims of the back-to-the-campus blues. With bright and inviting on the horizon, Homecoming looming,
Phi Delta Theta begins the groundwork for an unprecedented deal.

KAPPA ALPHA
This column has made it again. No doubt it has been censored. High Pressure King took a load (he went
without one) of the boys to Bristol in his semi-taxi. His latest lower weekend bargain (it’s the last printed here)
offer is a cab over the basement, but can’t to Bristol for only 50. The only Brother who was smart
enough (what a plug) to take advantage of this amazing offer was J. Q. Adams. What went on in Bristol
is hushed-up, but anyone with an imagination can imagine things—can’t he?

Grant took Richmond this past week for a reply as to who attended the game. At first he said: “I
couldn’t see who was there.” Attending were Mitchell, Biggers, Ditus, Gilmer, Bird, Sherry Stribling, Donald Watt, Ralph Dickson, Bill Buckey,
and Converse. Dating in Charlotte were Watt Jeffries with Eugenia Harris, Jim Wright with “C. H.” Andrews, McKeithen with Madame
X, Schmaltz with Rosalyn Harden, and Freshman Bryan, Robinson with Aileen.

The KAs took Spartanburg like Buckey and Bird ran up a score at Converse.

THE DAVIDSONIAN
Remember of the fraternity, there are some members of the fraternity. Don’t blame him, the senate has duties.

In Greensboro, tests he must be taking. Anyone desiring to start trials for purity, Brother Ata has four years to
complete them! The tests may contact Coach Pete Whittle for further details and information.

Each person is allowed an unofficial seat in the band section for his date. His idea is to increase the
morale of the band as a whole. That’s unselfishness in its purest form. Brothers Hamm and Walker put on their
usual good performance with the band and had little trouble in showing up the Wofford drum major. Brother Coble decided
to take advantage of the weekend and visit all over South Carolina. His first stop was Columbia, where he met
a traveling companion. Then they rolled into Spartanburg for the game and spent the night in Gaffney. Sunday, it was
back to Davidson.

Brother Cameron and Markey report an increase in prices at the Bates Cleaners.

Delta Psi on the Davidson campus is holding on apparently for dear life. Brothers McN and Mills, permanent stockholders at
Converse, spent the weekend at home with their dates. Fred McAllister and Jack Gray, a large number of stragglers are
making trials and several only need to pass one or two tests to complete them.
