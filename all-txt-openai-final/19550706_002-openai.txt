LETTER TO THE EDITOR:

Dearest Readers:

Have been out to Las Vegas to see my old friend Noel Coward, but I will be back on campus
in time for the social event of the Carolinas—Summer Frolics at De Ce. I'll be with my intimate friend, Southern
Scandal, from across the way.

May all your affairs be as successful as mine,

Louella O. Linker.

THE LATE COMERS

ED DAVIS comes back to Davidson after transferring to Chapel Hill at the end of his Sophomore year. When asked
how he liked Carolina, Ed's only comment was that a lot more partying is done there than at Davidson.

WARNER MENDENHALL, who will be a Senior this fall, is taking Psychology 22. An ATO, Warner is commuting to school
from Charlotte where he is building a house (literally) in the booming Derita section. This represents just one of Warner's
investments. During the school year, he works at the snackbar and is sometimes called by his fellow workers "the pride
of the snackbar." Warner's home is in Orlando, Florida.

TOMMY RIVERS is up from Charleston, S.C. for the second three weeks of S.S. Tommy is going into his Junior
year at Davidson. He has been quite an asset to the swimming team and his fraternity, Phi Delta Theta.

PAUL SELLERS comes to Davidson from Georgetown, S.C., and is taking Psy. 22. Paul is an amateur radio operator. If
you should hear strange sounds coming out of 1 East, it is not Paul talking to himself, but to one
of his radio pals. Incidentally, Paul is not kin to either Ed or Chuck Sellers.

FRED WALSH has returned to us for three hours via Psychology 22. He will graduate at the end of the
S.S. Fred has progressively moved from Yankeeland to the Deep South—Boston, Charlotte, and now Atlanta, Georgia. It is easy for
Fred to sport the newest model Chevrolet, for his father is a Chevrolet dealer.

SOUTHERN SCANDAL

MILLER BYNE went all the way to Georgia before he realized that he had left his bag at Davidson. By
the way, he won the Waynesboro Open Golf Tournament.

GEORGE SCOTT had a lonely 4th—Bobbie Horrison went to Florida without him.

SARAH ADAMS had a bout over the campus cat with dubious surgeons and various spectators. She won—"How would you feel
if they did that to you?"

RAY HARDING didn't celebrate the 4th until he got back to school on Monday night.

LYNNE PALMER didn't get anything done that she had planned to do over the 4th. Wonder which Lee took up
her time?

We were informed that we missed the big scoop last week. Belated Congratulations to CARROLL JENKINS who is now engaged
to Sudie Spain.

CESS FOOL became allergic to ED PRICE'S Piper Acrobatics while 2,000 feet over Chambers. LEROY the Rock didn't bat an
eye.

STUART COLLINS is now limping after falling asleep under a beach umbrella at Myrtle. He had taken every precaution, but
he forgot to pull his feet in.

Other Davidsonians at Myrtle Beach bumped into ARCHIE JOYNER who is Business Manager of the Playhouse at the Ocean Forest
where he has a suite full of dice girls.

J.D. STEWART, BOB SIVE, RANDY DANIELS, and SMITHY JOHNSTON really whooped it up in Montreat.

ED SCHOENBERGER has to thumb from now on. He left that big convertible in Jacksonville.

DR. E.E. BROWN has developed a passion for field trips. You ought to see those Biology students struggling through the
swamps.

JIM MURR faithfully promised his roommate that he would be back at Davidson Sunday night. But a little girl named
Jo Ann obviously detained him.

See you at Summer Frolics and remember to LIVE IT UP AND MAKE SOUTHERN SCANDAL.
