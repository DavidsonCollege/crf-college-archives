Solicitor: [Name not providedHandsome Lorenzo McPhail, Warner DuBose, and Gus Maynard were going around barefoot in front of Watts and
having the time of their lives doing it. This is the gospel truth: Prof. Fleagle’s darling little granddaughter from Greensboro
was uptown with him recently. She likes to watch the military drills on her visits to Davidson, for uniforms strike
her fancy. On espying Captain Cochran in the p.o., she exclaimed, "Oh, Grandpa, look at the soldier boy!"

Bigelow Bailey asked his roommate if his practicing on the clarinet made him nervous. Frey? McPhail sympathetically replied that it
did when he first heard people on this hall discussing it, “but now I'm getting so I don’t care what
happens to you,” he added.

A porter on a Greyhound the other morning announced the arrival of the bus with, “Davidson, this is the place
where Woodrow Wilson received his education—at.”

Attractive Carrie Lee Lingle is home from Agnes Scott for the Easter holidays. By the way, she is editor-in-chief of
“The Silhouette,” the college annual, this year and has taken an active part in other campus activities. I also hear
that she had a charming house guest over the weekend.

I guess by this time you have looked down at the signature and know who Tippy really is. Now, if
anybody wants to get even, they'll have to see me by appointment. I’m going to be a very busy man.
Just let me know a little beforehand so I can lock the door. My roommate, Lyman Clardy, says he will
not be responsible for any damage to the furniture, and I do hate a row!

Seriously, I really got a big kick out of writing this column. Everybody took it in the right spirit and
we enjoyed it together. Don’t you think for a minute I told even half of what I know. I was
very discreet and then that eagle-eyed editor, Ed Guerrant, often found it necessary to rule out the best of the
chatter. Why, sometimes I didn’t recognize my column when it appeared in the paper! But I don't blame him; I
thought he was a peach of an editor! I just hope you got half the pleasure out of reading it
that I did in writing it each week. Anyway, it was something new under the sun! So this is the
end—goodbye, au revoir, buenos días, auf Wiedersehen, and that’s all, there ain’t no more!

Your old friend,
Jack Williams, Jr., alias TIP POFF.

Collegiate Ramblings: J. E. LAKE

V. P. I. is to have none other than “Genial” Jan Garber and his orchestra and Kay Kyser and his
orchestra for their Easter dances this weekend, April 7th and 8th. Jan will play for the Cotillion Club Friday night
and Kay for the German Club on Saturday night. The Techmen are expecting a large crowd up there; they should
get it with two such fine orchestras. Both of these are well known, especially to listeners of WLW of Cincinnati.
Kay hasn’t played there lately, but Jan has been a regular entertainer for the last few months.

The Harvard Teachers Association has decided that examinations are no good. We imagine that all Davidson students will agree to
that and hope that it is enforced here. Not much chance while the present members of the student body are
here.

Roanoke

Beware of Minnesota co-eds. The co-eds at this university are liable to a fine of $10 or six days in
jail if they are found wearing a fraternity pin.

University of South Carolina

The Gamecock’s April Fool issue is called The Horse Doctor (neighing for prettier co-eds). Here are some of the headlines:
Beer rejected by U.S.C. students; Bradley leads students in Nudist movement; Frat merges with Sorority; $500,000 Stadium Given University.

WORLD SPECTATOR

Recent reports, put out by British news correspondents, have it that Russia is having a famine, and in some parts
of the country, a great many are dead from starvation. But according to Walter Duranty, things are not as bad
as they have been said to be. It is true that there is a food shortage in certain parts of
Russia, the Ukraine, North Caucasus, and lower Volga, but this shortage is not enough to cause wholesale deaths from starvation.
This food shortage has been caused by mismanagement and corruption on the part of some of the agricultural commissioners in
charge of the collective farming program. The Russian famine propaganda is another of a series of prophecies and statements issued
by British writers which later were found to have no foundation. It is true, however, that the present Russian condition
may become a terrible famine should the grain crop of this year fail. Should the weather ruin the grain crop,
the Russian Soviet would have a hard time holding its own, but if the crop is as usual, all the
present hunger will soon be over.

Last week, the British automobile manufacturers sold more cars than in any week since 1929. It is thought that this
shows a definite upward trend of the automobile business, and an indication of business in general. The record-breaking sales were
thought to have been caused by a return of confidence and an opening up of trade. If Great Britain is
returning from the depression, there is a feeling of general economic optimism for the whole world.

Rochester, New York, has recently had a mild strike. The farmers supplying the milk to the city have struck and
have not only declined to send their dairy products to Rochester, but have tried to cut off all milk supplies
to Rochester. The city, however, has been able so far to procure milk by having it brought in from neighboring
cities’ supplies by armed convoys of trucks. These trucks have in many cases had to fight their way through crowds
of irate farmers who tried in every way possible to dump the milk or else spoil it. The farmers succeeded
in ruining milk loads which were being taken to Rochester by independent producers. They either dumped the milk onto the
highway or poured oil or kerosene in it. It seems that this strike is a very foolish and brutal thing,
for should the strikers succeed in cutting off the Rochester milk supply, it would be the small children and infants
who would suffer. Milk is absolutely necessary to the life of the small children, and the farmers take advantage of
this fact in trying to raise the price of milk. But in so doing, they endanger the life of many
Rochester children. So far, however, the forces of law and order have been able to keep the city supplied with
milk.

Synthetic stone, usable for the building of any kind of building from bungalow to skyscraper, has recently been made by
research chemists at Purdue University. This stone is made by pulverizing a mixture of waste materials and compressing them in
steel molds under a pressure of 2,500 pounds per square inch. A chemical process is gotten by first drying the
compressed mass and then steaming it. The completed article is not unlike ordinary building stone and can be made any
color by the addition of coloring matter in the mixture. It is said, too, that the stone will not streak
with alkali which washes out of ordinary building stone when it becomes weathered. Laboratory tests show that the stone is
well adapted to building purposes and is as good as or better than regular building stone.

There are various signs of improvement in economic conditions throughout the world. Whether they are just slight tremors in the
business graph, or whether they are the beginning of a general upward trend in business is rather difficult to say.
It is, however, very pleasing to read that most of the leaders of business are optimistic, and if the mental
recovery is started, surely the material rise is not far away. The National City Bank, surveying recent events, states, “It
is demonstrated that sound measures, however drastic, will win the cooperation of the people, and if these measures are administered
as they deserve to be, there will be no question as to restoration of order in the credit situation.” Another
optimistic report is that issued by Leon Fraser, new president of the Bank of Industrial Settlements. He prophesied a return
of Great Britain to the gold standard and showed general optimism in a world economic recovery.

The Nazis are now doing all kinds of things to persecute the Jews in Germany, and are probably doing more
harm to themselves than they are helping the Nazi cause. Their persecutions have aroused the rest of the world against
them, and that is no slight account. Even if this were not the case, the vandalism and boycotting are hurting
Teutons about as much as Hebrews. The broken windows and destroyed stores are insured by German companies and are therefore
paid for by the Germans. The boycotting of all Jewish businesses means the throwing out of employment of a great
many Gentiles. So no matter how the situation is viewed, the Nazi program against the Jews seems foolish and entirely
unnecessary. How the German people can desire such a program is hard to understand. Perhaps they have been in a
depressed state for such a long time that they need something to give them a feeling of superiority and thus
preserve some of their self-respect.
