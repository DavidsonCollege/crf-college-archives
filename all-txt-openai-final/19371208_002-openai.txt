We have always been and always will be in favor of Davidson's high scholastic standards, but would we destroy this
to let in a herd of brainless football toters? Absolutely not! This editorial does not contradict the editorial of two
weeks ago concerning the athletic situation. We still agree that if an alumnus or friend wishes to help athletes or
any other students through school, this should be permitted and welcomed. We still hope that sometime athletic scholarships might be
arranged. At present, however, we await with bated breath the actions of the Southern Conference in session.

You. The Editor...

During the past three months, the editors of The Davidsonian have made a sincere attempt to put out an improved
paper; one that will please every student.

THE DAVIDSONIAN OPERATES A FREE LUNCH COUNTER FOR BUMS AND HOBOES. THEY FEED FROM 10 TO 25 DAILY. JOE D'URSO.

WEDNESDAY, DEC. 8, 1937

Dance weekend, even though unfortunately attended by a small number, was a decided triumph for the council and the new
plan. All told, chugging along in all a typical Davidson set with the price of milk blew sky high in
the exception perhaps that outsiders scarce—two, three ejected by the new committee for the only infraction of the rules. But
some lovely girls and gallant escorts. Understand the PIs lost around $150 on the weekend, which is rather remarkable considering
the small amount of publicity given these dances and the new situation. I wonder if they complied. Jerry Harris to

but can be placed upon those individuals besides the faculty and the students who wrote the paper and the Editor
(don’t forget him), would realize the fact that a paper was published by the students of Davidson, “For a Better
Davidson.” Already there have been mutinous murmurings about the campus. The word goes around that the Davidsonian is slipping, that
the old days of brilliant and hard-working writers and editors had passed, leaving the paper without a brain to stand
under. It is

Southern Conference “On the Spot”... (Continued from Page One)

Now can we believe that the Southern Conference is abiding by its own constitution or attempting to make others abide
by it? Then of what earthly purpose is a constitution? WE BELIEVE THAT THE SOUTHERN CONFERENCE WILL ABOLISH RULE 13
IN THEIR COMING MEETING. And that we recommend unless the conference decides to enforce their rules, which is now next
to impossible. Nor does Davidson College have only an objective interest in this meeting and its results. Dr. Oren Moore,
president of the Alumni Association states of the Charlotte News: “I have proof that not a single team in the
Southern Conference is adhering to its regulations.” He does not except Davidson in this statement. Hugh Query, editor of the
Gastonia Gazette is even more vehement. He states: “Even at Davidson there is no simon-pure policy. Several of the football
players are being helped through school, on the quiet by alumni and others. Technically speaking, the rules of the Southern
Conference are being broken. Davidson is violating the letter of the law, if not the spirit, in allowing its athletes
to accept even a minimum of help from other than natural sources.”

Perhaps these statements are too vehement, especially Editor Query’s, but there is a great deal of truth therein. Davidson's violations
are relatively minor compared with the wholesale subsidization existing in most Southern schools. But how can Davidson be blamed when
the cases mentioned have been submitted to the Southern Conference and approved? THE BLAME LIES IN THE SOUTHERN CONFERENCE. However,
we hope that the Conference will abide by and enforce the much-attacked Rule 2 of the same article. This states
that “no undergraduate student shall be eligible for varsity athletics until he has passed twenty-four semester hours or thirty-six quarter
hours. After an undergraduate student has become eligible for athletics, he must, to be eligible for any ensuing year, have
passed twenty-four semester hours or thirty-six quarter-hours of the previous year.” After all, a college is supposed to have some
scholarship standards, but Editor Query does not seem to think so. He accuses Davidson College, in the same article as
above, of being “so all-fired exclusive and high-minded.” Since when have alumni had the audacity to suggest that the College
lower its standards to pick up and gather into its ranks football material rather than college material?

In a recent issue

noted for their brilliance or at least, that body attitude is responsible for the lack of creative effort expended on
our rag, as it is responsible for such other noble and praiseworthy things as our efforts at imitating a large
and vicious colony of swarming bees while we are in what is euphemistically called chapel.

Some of the unofficial comment heard around the campus is really enlightening and probably would be even more enlightening and
create more of a stir, if its author

However, on being questioned as to the advisability of taking bacteriology in undergraduate work, Dr. Perlezweig replied with an emphatic
“no.” His point lay in the fact that the student only picked up a mass of jumbled and scattered facts
concerning that subject. The point is that Dr. Perlezweig's statement applies to the bacteriology courses in many colleges, but in
our minds and we don't believe in his, it does not apply to the local course. The local course is
a general course dealing primarily with the fundamentals of technique in the lab, a general knowledge of the terms involved,
and a few of the major pathogenic bacteria. However, it is not a smattering knowledge of a myriad of bacteria
and their characteristics. This letter is printed merely to explain what might be a rather disastrous misunderstanding. Dr. Perlezweig said
what he did say, but as we said before, his statement did not apply here.

SCIENCE MOVIES OF LITTLE VALUE, SAYS STUDENT...

The other night, after hearing practically nothing about the baritone singer. But, being a student in the science department, I
thought it only wise to better myself by seeing Power on Parade. Evidently, the person who booked the picture had
taken the producer's word for it! I surely hope he hadn't seen it before presenting it for the presentation proved
more than humorous. Many students, some of the faculty, and a couple of visitors, spent a solid hour of useful
time seeing molten iron being poured from a ladle into a form, cylinders and crankshafts being shaped, the parts being
swung together and the nuts tightened to hold them in place, and then a series of views of the Twin-City
(something) tractors completely assembled—the other reels of the movie consisted of a salesman’s talk and presentation of his tractor to
a farmer, for to

Since most of the pictures which

Why can't Davidson’s science department have such pictures? What about it, Department of Science?

students, it naturally follows that the science department should be very careful as to what is presented. I know the
department is not helped financially by bonuses from the corporations in advertising. Quite different from my experience here, I saw
some very fine educational pictures in high school. I remember one particularly on Surface Tension, and I think another was
Conductivity. These were educational pictures and when I left I knew something worthwhile.

Take It Easy By Rut Miller

DID YOU — know that there was more rain at Davidson than any other college in the United States with
the exception of Chucky Tech and Lincoln Memorial University? (unofficial report) — Know that this past set of dances was
one of the best ever held by this school? — Ever call for your date and find that she WAS
ready? — Ever notice how people quit supporting a losing football team??? — Ever from Doctor Sentelle without feeling the
least bit of anxiety? — See the All-Star game in Charlotte last Saturday? There were a lot of good boys
playing there that would do very well at Davidson if wink — Know that there were only seventeen shopping days
till Christmas.

IT'S ONE WAY — A certain church, so the tale was told to me, let the same way. These did
not have money enough to pay its pastor's salary and other expenses, so a new treasurer was elected. He sent
out letters to delinquents, and 90 per cent of them paid up their dues. He then sent a letter to
the remaining neglectful members, and all responded but one. This one received a third letter, and he too paid up.

Buy Christmas Seals

Shortly afterwards the pastor met this member and said: “Don't you think our new treasurer is doing splendid work? My
salary is now paid up and there is considerable money left in the church treasury.” “Yes,” he answered. “He is
a good collector, no doubt, but it's disgraceful for us to have a treasurer who doesn't even know how to
spell correctly. Why, would you believe it — he is so ignorant he begins ‘cockroach’ with a ‘k’ and spells
‘dirty’ with a double ‘r’.”

WAS IST DASS — Adam, after awakening from a deep sleep, and viewing for the first time his helpmate in
all her marvelous beauty, smiled broadly in amazed admiration. Then he began counting his ribs. “I wonder,” he mused, “if
a man could do without all his ribs.”

WINGS — There are many kinds of things. The best dictionaries will list all the things that anyone could possibly
be interested in. For instance, a thing in Psychology is a thing. That is indisputable. But probably the best things
in view right now are Christmas holidays and Spring vacation.

THUMBNAIL SKETCH — This person is surely known by all Davidson students by size if not by a personal acquaintanceship.
He treats them like he is one of the boys. He has a trim black mustache and is usually seen
wearing a suit of army khaki and leather boots. He is apparently never too busy to stop for a few
words and is always willing, nay, even anxious to tell a story of the army. Most of his time is
spent in a building back of West dormitory where he does practically everything that needs to be done. He has
been attending Davidson longer than any student now here and the department with which he works could not get along
without him as he will admit.

SERIOUS THOUGHT — The only place where errors cannot take place, whether in baseball or life, is in the grandstand.
