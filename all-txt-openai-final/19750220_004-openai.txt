Fiscal Exercise

When the administration announced that the freeze on student tuition would end this year, they were not kidding. During 1975-76 the administration expects to collect about $500 in extra fee increases from each enrolled student. Tuition fees will rise at least $300 next year. Dormitory rent will increase $50-$75. Further, all students receiving financial aid will be expected to contribute an extra $100 toward college costs next year. In other words, freshmen enrolled with aid must contribute $450 instead of $350; expected contributions from upperclassmen enrolled with aid will rise from the current $450 to $550. Board bills will also be higher next year. ARA food fees for freshmen, and for others on the meal plan, will increase $35. Many Patterson Court houses have already announced hikes in their food bills.

Although proposals for higher tuition and fees come as no great surprise, nor as a welcome announcement, the manner in which such fiscal decisions are made in regard to the yearly operating budget is a bit surprising. The SGA Senate passed a resolution this week calling for the early organization of an advisory council on fiscal, personnel, and developmental affairs to handle priority decisions within the yearly operating budget. We support this move to include all sectors of the college community in budget decisions and discussions.

Further, we support Professor of Economics Robert Avinger’s suggestion to use program budgeting as the method for determining the budget needs of certain departments, such as physical education, intercollegiate athletics, alumni operations, and admissions and financial aid. If Davidson is to remain committed to a balanced budget and simultaneously keep itself competitive in the market for students, we feel that such improvements in the budget process must be made immediately.

Watts’ Locks

The card lock doors and window screens proposed for Watts Dormitory in the name of campus security reveal a remarkable amount of faulty reasoning, a considerable amount of chauvinism, and an occasional touch of hysteria by administrators and students alike. The extra security measures for the women’s dormitory reflect at the least a condescending and chauvinistic attitude to the “Davidson little sister occupants.” According to Health, Education and Welfare officials, the added measures for the women’s dormitory probably constitute a violation of the 1972 Educational Amendment Acts Title IX section.

Equally disturbing is the ineffectual nature of the window screens. Easily removed from the outside with a few turns of a screwdriver, they are virtually impossible to remove from the inside. In case of fire or another emergency, the occupants of Watts are potentially trapped. And the screens are obviously little if any deterrent to anyone seeking to enter. The card lock doors are an extravagant financial addition to the security system. With locks on individual room doors, the need for a card lock system remains unsubstantiated, and to many, the system is totally undesirable.

We support Senator Shewmake’s proposal to make security policy at Davidson consistent. We further applaud the suggestion to remove window screens and to deter installation of a card-lock door system. We commend the SGA Senate for passing the resolution on Watts’ security, and we look forward to saner decisions in the future regarding security for all Davidson students.

Honors Students Experience, Research Rocky River

Arising near Mooresville and meandering 90 miles to empty into the Pee Dee River is a stream called the Rocky River. It absorbs the sewage discharges of ten major population groups and drains an area of 1400 square miles. The interests of the Honors Center staff in cleaning or at least observing the river were first aroused early last year. The Rocky River Project has since become the only endeavor in which Honors Center enrollees are required to participate.

Goals as set out by those involved are clearly defined. First, it was planned to aid students in attaining proficiency in the planning and various aspects of research conducted largely in the field. Secondly, it serves as a forum for faculty and student cooperation in interdisciplinary research. Finally, as the project concludes in the summer of 1975, a comprehensive report including significant aspects of all research work will be made available to the public. Disclosure of results, it is hoped, will create both awareness and concern on the part of the public which may in turn spur efforts to curtail pollution.

Last year, after it was determined that a systematic program of microbiological and macrobiological sampling would be feasible, fund-raising was undertaken. Large contributions from the Danforth Foundation and from the National Science Foundation provided working capital of over $90,000. The summer of 1974 saw the beginning of a pilot study during which Professors David Grant, Ralph Gable, and Williams Lammers, along with 5 students, conducted biological and chemical research. Starting with this academic year, Professors J. Harris Proctor and Ernest Patterson are offering projects in politics and economics dealing with Rocky River as well. Students choosing biological or chemical formats have engaged in systematic samplings of Rocky River flora and fauna at some 20 sites. Those opting for political or economic programs have investigated possibleSources of funds for rectifying the pollution problem and have delved into the general politico-economic ramifications of pollution and its prevention. All four options will be open through next year. Plans for this summer call for continued periodic sampling and analysis by five faculty members and ten students. Student participation will not be limited to Honors College members. Certain misapprehensions of the nature and purpose of the Rocky River Project seem to exist. To physically single-handedly dredge and purify the stream has not been the project’s aim. Such effort would be futile unless point sources of pollution may be monitored and controlled. It is hoped that the extensive research conducted over the three-year period will, when publicized, elicit a response from concerned citizens of such magnitude as to pressure those entities whose aid may be enlisted in cleaning the river by eliminating wholesale discharge of effluents. The Rocky River Project is one way of instilling in interested persons an apprehension of the means by which environmental damage is manifested on a local level, and the means by which it may be ameliorated. As such, it should be a program of importance to anyone concerned about maintaining a sane attitude toward environmental manipulation.

### Alumnus Critiques Blasé Davidsonian

To the Editor:

I would like to thank The Davidsonian staff for the complimentary paper that they sent me last month. As a former Davidsonian staffer, I welcomed a chance to reacquaint myself with the old school. Having read it, however, I cannot contain my disappointment. I cannot believe how much The Davidsonian has changed for the worse. When I was on the staff, students were constantly making charges and administrators were constantly making denials. Some of the charges were paranoid and some of the denials were bovine excreta, but at least the students had a sounding board for their grievances. We kept the administration on its toes. There was not a single controversial note in the Davidsonian that I received. Every article consisted of self-congratulatory comments by administrators about what a job they had done, were doing, and would continue to do. No problem was pointed out except by an administrator, who always followed immediately with bland assurances that everything will be all right.

When I was on the staff, The Davidsonian flexed its journalistic muscles from time to time and delved deep into some major issue. The problems and hopes of the black students, the reform or abolition of fraternities, the implementation of curriculum changes, the criteria for admission, the administration of financial aid programs, the enforcement of drug regulations, and coeducation were among the areas explored by The Davidsonian’s investigative reporters. We were not always right, and we often drew fire for our alleged biases, but we were not afraid to dig into problems of our college, because we hoped that our exposes would improve conditions at Davidson. Where is our adventuresome spirit today? I could not find it reflected in the pages of The Davidsonian that I received.

In Deaton’s editorial, he promised that he would make The Davidsonian “a gadfly to this community.” This is a worthy ambition for any newspaper editor. Past editors of The Davidsonian, such as Bob Dunham (1969-1970), Ed Shoaf (1970-1971), and Russ Merritt (1971-1972), showed what a useful gadfly The Davidsonian has been in past years. Study their example if you wish to know how to edit a gadfly college newspaper.

### Hockey Club Uses Power Play

To the Editor:

With the new proposals for physical education requirements, club sports could become increasingly popular at Davidson. One such organization is the Hockey Club, which was first organized two years ago by Ross Manire and myself. The club has continued to operate in some fashion every winter since the first one. The club plays every Thursday night at the Holiday Ice Rink in Concord from ten to midnight. Club members include everything from experienced skaters who have played considerably in Canada, Europe, and New England to Southerners who had never skated at all or held a hockey stick before they began to play at Davidson. The idea of it all, however, is fun, so all people interested in playing hockey, learning to play hockey, or just getting some exercise during the winter are encouraged to join the club, especially since it appears that P.E. credit can be earned by participating in a club sport.

Other Southern universities, such as Georgia Tech and Tennessee, have club hockey teams, and the Davidson group hopes to be able to play them eventually; the prohibitive cost of equipment has so far prevented such contests. The Davidson club has had trouble getting any financial support from the school and members have paid for practice time themselves. The lack of equipment has necessitated an easygoing style of play and no one has received more than a few minor bruises and injuries to pride in the three years of the club’s existence. Besides players, the club welcomes anyone who wishes to watch an often amusing brand of hockey. Club members leave for Concord Thursday nights at 9 p.m. from the ATO house.
