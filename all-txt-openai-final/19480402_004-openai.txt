ROAMING WITH RONNY
(Continued From Page Four)

“The skipper was Captain J. A. ——, an old merchant marine officer of about 62 years of age. His favorite
topic was atheism, of which persuasion he claimed to be an exponent. (‘Willie L.’, of course, never had a true
test of her mettle, being in the hands of a heretic.) The ship sailed alone and did not sail in
convoy but sailed alone except for firing on a whale. (The captain wanted to kill Jonah.)”

Eckerd’s lost 40 pounds because of the food. Everyone was suspected by the armed guard crew. The cook was a
former longshoreman, who would get down on all fours and cry to Allah on the slightest provocation. Our proud protege,
“Willie L.”, was gone completely as she was to be used by the Navy in an experimental project. Dr. Cunningham's
letter has been returned to the college, having been found in the wardroom of the ship at the time of
decommissioning, and preserved for us by some kindly soul. This letter is in bad repair, stained by many seasons and
countless undiscerning hands. It should be framed as a memorial to a kindly effort gone astray and a heritage unfulfilled.

AMONG THE GREEKS...
(Continued From Page Four)

All the brothers are relaxing now after the busy three-day installment period that we have just gone through, and anxiously
awaiting their big neon rings (to add to their Sig pins). Although no public announcements have been made yet, many
are reportedly making plans for their pins (to grace some fair damsel’s figure, that is). Bill Richard already has five
claims. (Bill's political experience in handling delicate situations will come in handy.) The big banquet at the Charlotte Hotel was
the crowning climax of the installment, and at the banquet “Senator” Richard was busy selling ducks and urging claimants on
his spin. Richard was seen leading a duck into the hotel lobby at 10:30 with Gopher's suspenders for a leash
(meanwhile “Gopher” was sitting it out). The result: Richard won a bet and collected five dollars. While this was going
on, Butt was at the banquet hoping it would never end because his plastic suspenders were scraping the floor from
the heat.

As if three days of installment weren't enough, many of our Sigs were off wheeling again on Sunday (probably to
show off their pins). Butt got full of afternoon at Queens, busy in a neon. Brown was with his private
secretary in Charlotte, and Homer Hayworth drove up to the house in a cream-colored Packard convertible and four bouncing beauties.
Immediately the house was thrown into confusion and Bill Clarke went to work with his see-all camera. He expects to
make a fortune from his blackmail. John Pritchard took after the girl that owned the car, hotly pursued by Jim
Riddervold (who got her address!). Jim Gribben was just flitting around from girl to girl. Hating to see a beautiful
sunny day go to waste also, Morgan and Hamilton took off for a few pleasant hours in Concord. The most
surprising (unexpected anyway) move of all was John Carr's quick trip to Winston-Salem on Sunday. That shows Carr's thirst for
knowledge at Salem College (check that rhyme scheme). Carr's choice was Joyce!

Now that we are all brothers of Sigma Chi we can all go home for the holidays and rotate to
the tune of “Significant Sigs”—and don't everybody rush at once to see who can give his pin away first!

Cinema Comments ... By WALTER MANN

Monday and Tuesday April 5 and 6
“FUN AND FANCY FREE”

Walt Disney has done it again. That is he has done the American public again. Mr. Disney says that he
found the ethical justification for his misdeed in the time-honored golden rule of “Do others before they have a chance
to do you.” But if Mr. Disney has swindled the public in the content of his animated drama, he can
certainly not be accused of defrauding if one looks at his cartoon from the standpoint of “title value.” The value
of the name can hardly be calculated. Following the time-honored custom established by the clergy, I shall try to bring
out three points which prove the worth of the heading under which this film is presented to the world.

To begin: Fun—the producers must certainly have had fun enough while producing this movie. They should have even had some
left over for their old age. Attacking this point from another angle: It is certainly funny that a man would
use his time to produce or that adult American audiences would spend their money to see such a picture.

Secondly: Fancy—the production is certainly fanciful. In fact, there are few things more fanciful than Charlie McCarthy and “Jack and
The Beanstalk” combined in one story.

The two parts of the title previously discussed were certainly appropriate, but the word “free” is even more so. It
is significant because this is exactly the price that should be charged for admission to the showing of this cinematic
production.

Wednesday and Thursday April 7 and 8
“RIFF RAFF”

For those uninitiated in geographical lore, Riff Raff is a sort of Ubangi kayak. The members of this noble African
tribe use these nautical wonders for hunting purposes as much as their northern cousins use their ships of skin and
bones. In fact, their quarry is very similar to that sought by the Eskimo. These sable-skinned hunters paddle their riff-raffs
up and down the famous river Styx in search of the wary koroseal. Aside from its elastically delicious flesh, the
koroseal is also especially valuable because of its beautiful hide. All Ubangi tribes keep themselves well supplied with tobacco, snuff,
nose rings, and neon signs by selling the pelts in wholesale lots to B. F. Goodrich Company.
