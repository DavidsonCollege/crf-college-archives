**RIS & LIVING MONDAY, FEBRUARY 3, 1997**

Last week, the phrase "sold out" slowly became the core of my frustration as it was passed around in various
and sundry forms referring to one thing only: Star Wars. The hot spot of the week was Carolina Pavilion 22,
an airport-sized movie theater that boasted THX sound, stadium seating, and tickets in advance if you had a credit card
— but who doesn’t? Consequently, several Davidson students were spotted strutting around with the confidence of knowing they had tickets
to one of the most coveted movie experiences since the film’s initial release. Those slow on the draw were content
in the knowledge that Movies at the Lake wasn’t selling tickets until Friday, though the fear of missing another chance
proved too much for some.

Doug Meislahn arrived at the box office at 9 o’clock on Friday morning, remained the only person in line for
about three and a half hours, and didn’t touch his tickets for another two. But he took his responsibility seriously,
and though the ticket vendor raised his eyebrows when Doug asked for 27 student tickets, presenting one ID as proof,
the Force must have been on his side.

The movie itself seemed to meet everyone’s demands. If Jurassic Park made you believe genetic science actually could clone dinosaurs,
the Star Wars Special Edition will definitely amaze you. Simply seeing the movie in the theaters was enough for me.
My eyes darted from one corner of the screen to the other as they tried to take in the complete
glory of 35mm film, most of which is lost in the video translation. The revamped sound also made a distinct
impact. Every time the Millennium Falcon shot past the camera or an Imperial Star Destroyer drifted by, the audience felt
the movement in addition to hearing it. The theater experience was nothing short of amazing, and considering that a large
part of our generation never got to see it on the big screen, the excitement was inherently doubled.

Around four and a half minutes were added to the original stock, including the famed Jabba scene and a short
interchange between Luke and his friend Biggs. Though everyone I’ve talked to loved the additions, I still can’t be entirely
impressed with all of them. I worship Star Wars as much as the next guy (probably more), but most of
the added special effects glowed as digital technology is wont to do — not helped by the fact that Tatooine
offers a very drab backdrop to 90s computer-generated graphics. Also, the human body exhibits movements so complex that it should
come as no surprise that not even the most advanced computers can duplicate them with much authenticity. The Special Edition
tried.

One place that I thought the new effects worked perfectly was the space battles. The quick action, heightened explosions, and
brisk editing made them all the more exciting. Maybe it’s a question of...

**Peklo fights fire with dedication**

Art has limitless vectors of expression. This week’s interview focuses on a more practical artist. Senior Josh Peklo was recently
the first Davidson student to be appointed Captain of the Davidson Volunteer Fire Department. Not only is Josh the first
student to be appointed to a leadership role, but he is also the youngest captain ever in the town’s history.

Josh, how did you get interested in firefighting?

I grew up in a small town, West Friendship, Maryland, and my family always had involvement with the local fire
department as far as going to the fund-raisers and open house events. We also had to call in their services
once or twice. When I was at one of the open house events, I found out that once I turned
16 I could become a volunteer, and this was something that I had always...ways been interested in. I can remember
the siren going off while I was in school, and I can remember thinking that people who were volunteers were
going to take care of whatever the emergency was. So, I thought I would try it out as an activity
and got involved with it.

What was it like when you first became a full-fledged volunteer?

First, I had to take a training class, 120 hours. It met a couple of times a week and took
about six months. So, after I took that, I was actually allowed to go on calls. At first, it was
a combination of excitement and fear. It was a little bit scary at first knowing that you are 16 years
old, you have this training, and you know how to do it. If you are one of the first to
arrive, whether it’s a minor call or a big fire, then whomever called you expects you to know what to
do. There was certainly excitement, but the obligation to the community is a serious factor, and you always want to
make sure you do a good job. As the excitement fades, you really begin to trust your training and the
apprehension begins to go away. They tell you in training that when you drive up to a burning building, most
people are running out of the building, but you are going in—try not to think that you are crazy. It
was a good training program. It taught you faith in your equipment and inspired confidence towards the people you worked
with. The older members really help you feel more secure.

How did you get involved with the Davidson Fire Department?

When I was looking at colleges, one of the things I always looked for was whether or not it had
a volunteer fire department. I wasn’t going to let that be a deciding factor in where I went, but it
definitely helped. When I came to Davidson as a freshman, I stopped by the fire department and talked to the
chief and got an application and joined the department. I’ve been doing it my four years here.

How does it feel to be the first Davidson student to be appointed an officer of the Davidson Fire Department?

I consider it a tremendous honor that I was chosen. I’ve learned a lot here in Davidson, but I guess
my training back in Maryland really prepared me for a leadership role. It was a real surprise when the chief
first came to me since there has never been a student officer.

What is your favorite kind of emergency call?

My favorite kind of call is the stereotypical cat-stuck-in-a-tree call. We actually do get those from time to time, and
it really is a lot of fun because there is not a lot of pressure. When you do go up
and get the cat out of the tree, it really pleases whomever the cat belongs to. I’ve been involved in
a couple of cat rescues. It was something that I thought was a myth when I joined the department, but
people do call.
