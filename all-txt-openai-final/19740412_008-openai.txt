**Scandling Opposes Athletic Scholarships At Davidson**

To the Editor:

In the last issue of THE DAVIDSONIAN (April 5, 1974) two columnists, Mark Wilensky and Pete Celentano, suggested that a
re-evaluation of Davidson's sports philosophy may be in order. Mark Wilensky wrote in support of athletic scholarships. I would like
to express my opinion of athletic scholarships.

I am opposed to athletic scholarships. It seems that anytime money is pumped into a sport, expectations rise. I believe
that Davidson athletes and coaches should not be subjected to the tyranny of the expectations implicit in scholarship support. I
subscribe to the philosophy that intercollegiate athletics are non-scholarship endeavors here for the benefit of those students who wish to
participate. Academics certainly take precedence over athletics. This has been my understanding of the wrestling program here, and I am
glad to have participated under these terms.

Two questions now arise: can we get a sufficient number of walk-ons to compete? And, can we compete under such
a walk-on basis? My answer to both is yes. Few people realize how unusual it is for a school this
size in the South to have a non-scholarship wrestling team, especially one composed mostly of one-sport athletes, but this is
the case here. Someone competitively interested in wrestling would never consider coming here. Yet, we have had some good wrestlers
here in my four years, and I dare say all have come here for the academics. Academics and student life
are the only lures we should use when trying to snare prospective athletes.

As for our ability to compete on a walk-on basis, that is a question of our competition. Scheduling is the
obvious answer. Each year our wrestling schedule has on it several teams who will beat us, several teams we will
beat, and several matches which provide us with a challenging season. Granted, our records have not been the best, but
my first two years here we had winning seasons. Championships are an impossibility as long as we remain in the
Southern Conference. Although everything seems to be working against us, I still feel that we can compete respectably. I feel
that the other sports here can also compete without scholarship aid.

I am seriously concerned about the new form of aid which will go to athletes under the need basis. The
Wildcat Club will grant an athlete a “scholarship” in order that he not have to take a loan or a
job if it is determined that he needs either or both. The problem is that this will not be a
uniform practice throughout all sports but will be limited by the funds available.

**Guru Fervor Hits American Middle Class College Youth**

The latest far-out cult in today’s counterculture, the ‘Divine Light Mission,’ is sweeping America. Mahatma gurus from India, in less
than two years, have converted over 60,000 Americans. Most of the converted have been middle-class youth, many of them in
college. Thousands of American young people will converge on the Houston Astrodome in November for the Divine Light’s inauguration of
cultural birth. At the center of the Houston gathering will be 15-year-old Guru Maharaj Ji, the “Perfect Spiritual Master” of
this new religious movement. With the title “The Lord of the Universe,” this young guru is regarded by his followers
as the Deity incarnate. In his presence, his devotees prostrate, offer flowers, and kiss his feet. The Divine Light followers
believe that Maharaj Ji’s movement will dissolve all the world’s problems, such as racism, poverty, and warfare.

Commenting on the Divine Light Mission, William H. Barr, assistant director of the division of student activities at Michigan State
University, says: “Higher education seems ill-equipped to grapple with the utopian visions of youth and the sectarian scenarios they embrace.
Yet if movements like the Divine Light Mission surface on a campus, faculty and staff members should attend their meetings,
rap with the kids, and thereby expand their awareness of student culture. Our staffs must view these quests as part
of the current orchestration for cultural rebirth, with overtones that transcend any one instrument... Adolescents desperately need such encounters. So
do adults.”amount of funds that the Wildcat Club solicits. This is grossly unfair, and some other factors will undoubtedly come
into play in the determination of which sports and athletes receive the "scholarships." I may be naive, but I do
not care to see Davidson athletics caught up in the expectations which athletic scholarships imply.

The Joy Of Eating

Down And Out
Around And About Charlotte

WORLD'S BEST PECAN PIE! FAMOUS BLUE RIBBON STEAKS!

With no more pretentious gloating than that, Anderson’s Restaurant has acquired a secure spot in Charlotte on Elizabeth Avenue and
in the hearts of devoted clientele. Anderson's is a family restaurant - very functional - with booths lined around the
sides and down the middle. High chairs in the corners and children's menus flesh out the story. So it appears
at least, but on the last couple of visits most of the customers have appeared to be on the downhill
side of middle age.

Only rarely is Anderson's suggested in discussions of eating places in Charlotte, but this is due almost entirely to the
shortsightedness of flashy gourmets. Anderson's is so nondescript, so restaurantesque, that it frequently escapes the attention of people searching only
for charm and atmosphere.

BUT THE FOOD! An examination of the menu immediately impresses one with the low prices of the profuse entrees. The
famished eater can waddle out for less than two dollars. Most meals are typical of those in any other restaurant
in the area and are served oven hot with a minimum of fuss. But one of their numbers - the
Hot Dorsey Sandwich - would be outstanding in any restaurant anywhere. Briefly described, the Hot Dorsey ($1.85) is a remarkable
combination of kirsch and a ham sandwich, and is served in a baking dish in the same manner as lasagne.
Even Roger Manley says that the pecan pie is the world’s best, but I would also recommend the Boston Cream
Pie. For those of you who have experienced this delight, be assured that this is really Boston Cream Pie and
not a silly Southern shortcut between angel food cake and banana pudding.

Next time you go to Queens, or to South Park better yet, look to your right as you pass the
entrance to Presbyterian Hospital on the left, and there you will see Anderson's.

Down on the south side of Charlotte on South 21 is a drive-in called South 21. Every small town has
a drive-in with a reputation supported not so much by the food as by the cars cruising the lot, and
chances are that many of these places were modeled after the South 21. Charlotte is generally conceded to be the
home of drive-ins of both the restaurant and the movie species. In fact, this area still has the highest per
capita number of drive-in movies of any place in the world. Within this mecca, South 21 is the grandpappy of
them all. A decade ago, South 21 was in its prime and provided the hub for a culture far more
complete than has been supported by any institution since that time. I even know someone who proposed to his Junie
Moon there. Today, family-pecked kids all over Charlotte soothe their munchies at the drive-in after blowing their lids. But so
much for the aura. John Bevan went there after the opera last week and enjoyed it thoroughly. Other sources say
that this is the only stay-in-your-car place in Charlotte that still uses real onions for their onion rings. This authenticity
can be found in other items on the menu also. For whatever would possess you to go to a drive-in,
just remember that South 21 is the original and still the best.

Next week: Please don't tell me your Calabash stories.
