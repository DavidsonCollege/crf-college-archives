#### The cast of the Vagina Monologues kicks back after a hard day’s work.

### The vaginas are coming!
By SARAH ROBINSON, Arts & Living Editor Emeritus

Thirty-five women and one man have combined talents to produce an original version of Eve Ensler’s provocative play “The Vagina Monologues,” which premieres this Friday in the Duke Family Performance Hall. “The Vagina Monologues” is part of the V-Day campaign, an awareness event to stop violence against women and girls. Last year was the first time students performed the show on campus.

To preview the show, I attended a rehearsal of the production last Sunday. I was immediately struck by the relaxed atmosphere and sense of camaraderie among the cast, which made me excited to see what they had in store for their production of Ensler’s work. The play features a combination of upbeat and heartrending stories. Some of the pieces involve full cast participation, such as the defiant “My Short Skirt,” whereas others feature only one or a few participants. One piece, called “My Vagina was my Village,” features translated dialogue of two women’s ultimately tragic stories. Each monologue builds off of the one that precedes it, though each conveys its own unique message. The cast often actively participates in the monologue transitions, making for a lively dynamic that persists throughout the play. The entire show runs about two hours.

To be honest, I was a bit skeptical before coming to the rehearsal. Women’s issues have come up so many times this year, and usually not in a good way. It almost felt like many people on campus were pushing these issues too hard. Nevertheless, I tried to set my skepticism aside when evaluating the performance. After all, I’m just a theater reviewer who happens to have, well, a vagina.

Having a vagina, however, was not a prerequisite for directing this year’s play. In fact, this year’s “Monologues” is co-directed by Visiting Assistant Professor of Theatre Scott Ripley. Ripley said he was drawn to the production for his own reasons, which mainly include having a 17-year-old daughter who has faced the kind of biases against females that are addressed in the play. He is directing the Vagina Monologues on an entirely voluntary basis, since it is not being staged by the Davidson Theatre Department.

Aside from having a new director, this year’s production is unique in that many cast members have not participated in traditional theatre productions before. A few faculty and community members are also participating in this year’s show. These older cast members provide an emotional depth that might have been difficult for younger members to express. For example, Assistant Dean of Students Kathy Bray-Merrell retells a touching story on childbirth which allows the audience to grasp the importance of this event.

“It’s not just about vaginas, but about getting a dialogue started and allowing women to get a voice, to re-empower women.” - Heather Yopp ‘06

In preparation for the production, the cast was asked to draw individual interpretations of their vaginas, which are on display in the Union. Ellen Ioanes ‘09 said that these pictures are “not about being explicit or graphic, but about something that is life-giving and beautiful.” The vaginas are meant to show how women interpret their body and how society has taught them to see their body. Heather Yopp ‘06, co-president of the Women’s Committee and producer of the production, said “it’s not just about vaginas, but about getting a dialogue started and allowing women to get a voice, to re-empower women.” “It’s not about agreeing with all stories, but the overarching message,” she said.

In addition to ticket sales, the production is selling chocolate vagina lollipops for $2 and raffle tickets for $1, which go toward a drawing for a basket of various spa-related goodies. The lollipops and raffle tickets are being sold in the Union this week. All proceeds will go to the International Organization for Women and Development. The play will take place Friday and Saturday evening at 8 p.m. Tickets are on sale at the box office, and are $5 for Davidson affiliates and $8 for community members. There will be talk-backs after both of the performances, with the director, cast, Health Advisor Georgia Ringle, and Assistant Professor of English Ann Fox.

### Dorms of distinction
By AMOURA CARTER, Staff Writer

Most college students attempt to bring a little bit of home to their otherwise uninspired, white-walled...Dorm rooms. Some Davidson students have gone beyond the typical dorm decorations of celebrity posters and pictures from home to create thematic living environs that reflect their personality and style. Bianca Guinn ’08 and Elyse Harris ’08 have created an art-themed room out of original artwork. “I brought my art with me to school because it’s a piece of who I am,” Guinn said. “If I left it at home it would be like leaving a piece of myself.” “We wanted our room to reflect our personalities so we included many bright colors, pictures, and art,” added Harris.

Candace Coleman ’08 looked to do something a little different with her own living space to make her feel more at home. She and roommate Annamarie Glaize ’08 took an understated approach and aimed for simplicity. “That is, less is more,” Coleman said. “Minimalist atmospheres are very conducive for work.” Craig Pickett ’08 took the concept of simplicity to an extreme when creating his room, which contains little aside from a king-size bed in the center. Pickett joined the room’s two twin beds together to form his new resting place after the departure of his former roommate. “I arranged my room so that I could have my area to converse with others, which is on my futon, and an area to rest, which is on my king-size bed,” he said.

One roommate’s love for soccer and the other’s sense of style helped roommates Aaron West ’08 and Matt Hayes ’08 create their ideal room. “I think even though our room is the smallest on our hall, we’ve made the best use of space,” West said. “It seems both spacious and comfortable without seeming impersonal. Both Matt and I have put our personal touch all over, so it’s really ours.” Gordon Ballingrod’s ’08 room has what he describes as a “modern feel.” It is decorated with many silver accessories and black and white photos. “My roommate has spent a lot of time and effort furnishing and decorating our room,” Ballingrod said. “It can be difficult to walk through at night, but it garners a lot of compliments and visits from our hall mates.”

The rooms of some Davidson students, however, definitely failed to impress. Some residents noted how easily their rooms had deteriorated into such disastrous states. As one occupant of Cannon put it, “I will do my laundry and I don’t feel like putting it up, and before you know it, clothes become shoes become books become ‘where’s the remote’?” Whether they treat or mistreat their living spaces, Davidson students all put a personal touch on their dorms, for better or worse.

Yellowcard’s third album shows “maturity” but lacks creative edge. ‘Lights and Sounds’ unimpressive

By PRESTON Davis Staff Writer

Whether you are one of the 1.7 million people who bought the album “Ocean Avenue” or are just a fan of contemporary rock music, prepare yourself for Yellowcard’s latest release. The group, who hails from Jacksonville, Florida, is back with a new album titled “Lights and Sounds.” Unlike “Ocean Avenue” or “One for the Kids,” “Lights and Sounds” is stylistically all over the place. In the transition of leaving behind their emo roots to embrace a more traditional rock sound, the band loses both the punk quality of its past as well as some of its individual personality. It seems that Yellowcard, in trying to lose the inferiority complex that has often held back emo bands, wants to break out onto the larger stage. In the process of becoming more widely known, however, there seem to be some awkward spots.

The main problem with this album is its lack of that distinctive quality that captured me in the band’s last two records. The band’s use of the violin, played by band member Sean Mackin, is what really separates them from other modern rock groups. In “Lights and Sounds,” however, Mackin makes a more subdued appearance than in previous albums. After going to yellowcardrock.com and listening to the new title song “Lights and Sounds,” I felt as if I had been let down. There were some good things to be said, however. Songs such as “Rough Landing, Holly,” “Waiting Game,” and “Martin Sheen or JFK” have incredible dynamics. Within the album itself, Yellowcard looks for balance by separating these tracks with slower, more methodical songs that place their emphasis on the lyrics. The title track “Lights and Sounds” can be misleading. The song begins with the author—
