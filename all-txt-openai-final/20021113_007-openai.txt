**Staff Editorial**

There was an interesting article in Tuesday’s New York Times about minorities and American colleges, certainly a major topic here
at Davidson. Efforts to recruit minority students over the last several decades are paying off, as many campuses are more
diverse than ever, the article said. Now, colleges are aiming toward a broader goal—building better relationships among racial and ethnic
groups within their student bodies. They’re realizing that diversity is about more than numbers.

An event on Sunday night suggests that some on our campus are beginning to understand that point. The BSC hosted
a forum on intercultural dating, moderated by Allen Lee ’01. Students discussed a variety of topics, centering on how race
and ethnicity affect the relationships we pursue during our college careers. Bringing minority students to a campus doesn’t qualify as
diversity. Colleges also must create an environment in which diverse people can interact and learn from one another. Those who
participated in the forum realize that. Let’s hope they’re not the only ones.

**This Quiz Bowl thing is really catching on.**

The campus-wide tournament, the first of its kind at Davidson in several years, is in full swing, with matches taking
place nearly every night. Your friendly Davidsonian staff took its first loss Monday night, but we’re not done yet, and
neither are most of the other teams trying to get to the championship round. The tournament isn’t nearly over (it
won’t end until December), but it already appears to be a smashing success. So why not make it a regular
event? Let’s have one of these deals once every semester. It doesn’t cost much money, it brings people together and
it’s good, friendly competition. Good luck to the teams still alive in the tournament, and here’s hoping those who aren’t
get another chance to hit the buzzers again soon.

**It’s registration season again, and the WebTree system is back in the spotlight.**

Without question, registering online is much more convenient and efficient than the old way, which required pencils and Scantron sheets.
But do we have to keep using those confusing tree formats to rank our course preferences? We’re not experts on
course registration systems by any stretch, but isn’t there an easier option than those tree flow charts? By the way,
you’ve got until midnight to finish filling out those trees.

OK...IN CASE THERE ARE ANY MORE HELICOPTER PILOT TRAINEES IN HERE, THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX IS JUST AN EXPRESSION...

**Thanks for explaining my political views**

I just wanted to extend my thanks to Travis Lee for his comments in last week’s lead story (“Poll Finds
Students Lean Left,” Nov. 5). Until I read Mr. Lee’s statement concerning students’ desire to be “fashionably liberal,” I had
always thought my liberalism stemmed from strong personal convictions for civil rights, social and economic justice, and a commitment to
the First Amendment. After reading Mr. Lee’s comments, however, I now understand that my liberalism has nothing to do with
this; rather it stems simply from my desire to be liked. I hope others who felt as I did can
now understand their political views.Views more correctly as a result of Mr. Lee’s wise analysis. Fashionably,

Can someone please fix those nets?

Since two work orders placed more than two months ago are not enough to get something done, I want to
let everyone know what’s wrong and what needs to be fixed. The chain nets on the West basketball court have
been completely broken since the beginning of the semester. Besides being a nuisance, they are hazardous due to the sharp
and rusty ends of the drooping metal chains. Why does the maintenance staff ignore a long-time problem, especially when the
problem is repeatedly reported to them (the same problem happened at the end of last year, too)? Please, someone do
something about these nets.

When did having fun go out of style?

Something is plaguing me. I realize that much of our student body is satisfied with life at our school, but
I believe that many students want the old familiar and fun school. The Davidson College to which I applied is
now some yuppy Amherst wannabe (and this isn’t a North/South issue) rather than the life-source that it once was. I
hate to complain, because I am fortunate to be here, but some aspects of our school need to change.

Patterson Court should not walk on eggshells in order to appease those who complain of noise levels or take offense
to party themes. The majority of our campus is affiliated with the Court and should not be victim to its
recent transformations. Whatever happened to those random weekday nights of fabulous debauchery that would eventually dwindle at dawn? When did
we resort to accepting the vices of academic servitude rather than rebelling against them? When did we become so scared?

In truth, Patterson Court is a wonderful establishment that encourages students to interact with each other. The Court sponsors community
service events, forums, and other meaningful activities, in addition to the ever-abrasive evening fun. It also prevents drunk driving. Shouldn’t
we be comforted knowing that our friends and classmates are safely walking home? Isn’t it pretty selfish to be aggravated
by those who are too loud? And if they are too loud, why not buy earplugs?

The average eating-house or fraternity member pays between $800 and $1,200 per semester. They are paying dues to be a
member of a house they cannot even use freely. Impromptus have disappeared. I haven’t the faintest idea as to where
the jolly Friday Afternoon Club wandered. Court activities are sometimes trivial and time-consuming pastimes that some may condemn as spiritually
and mentally vacant. But if we log in five to seven hours a day, shouldn’t we reward ourselves with mindless
revelry? Shouldn’t we pursue mysteries of Patterson Court rather than succumb to the dogged verses of electronic reserve?

Alcohol consumption (while unhealthy) is not a sin, making a fool of one’s self will not brand you with that
evil scarlet letter, and dancing on a table is, in fact, an aerobic exercise. This school used to be electrifying.
People were drawn to the subtle noises that came from the Court. Now, those same people will not even venture
down the hill because they fear awakening someone or being blamed for something they didn’t do. We are adults, and
we should not concede to the malaise that has recently plagued our school.
