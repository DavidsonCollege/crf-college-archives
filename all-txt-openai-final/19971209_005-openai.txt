1960s Basketball: A School Success Story

Driesell’s squads earned national attention

Watching Davidson’s impressive start on its 89th basketball season has caused many to conjure up the warm memories of another time, a time some refer to as the “Golden Age” of Davidson basketball. These were the Lefty Driesell years and the time when a controversial coach succeeded in transforming a weak team of “preministerials” into a strong team of aspiring All-Americans. And one cannot forget the manpower behind the movement, the players who carried basketball to this “sleepy little town” on their shoulders.

The seasons of 1962-69 brought Davidson what it had only dreamed of: Southern Conference regular season championships, Southern Conference tournament titles, national rankings, NCAA Tournament wins, spots in the Elite Eight, and most importantly, the emergence of Davidson basketball as a force to be reckoned with.

In 1963, the Wildcats accomplished a 20-win season for the first time in school history. Under the direction of coach C. G. (“Lefty”) Driesell, Davidson orchestrated a Cinderella season. Finishing second in the Southern Conference, the Wildcats posted an overall record of 22-7. However, Davidson stumbled in the finals of the conference tournament, falling to West Virginia, and ending their hopes for an invitation to the NCAA tournament.

At that time, many athletic conferences, including the Atlantic Coast and Southern, selected their representatives to the NCAA solely by the postseason tournament method, thus leaving out many talented teams that failed to win the championship game.

The 1963-64 season was to be the true test of Davidson’s competence. Some fans had high expectations for the Wildcats, while others dismissed the previous season as a fluke — a Cinderella story that had already been closed and moved to the shelves. Nevertheless, Driesell and “his boys” continued their march to the national rankings. The phenomenal Fred Hetzel, who was boosted by one sports writer as the “most outstanding Davidson athlete to have put on a uniform in recent history,” led his teammates to an impressive 22-4 record and a regular season championship.

Fueled by momentum and armed with the “patented zone press,” Davidson headed into the postseason with high aspirations. But the league tourney would again be the Wildcats’ nemesis, as they went home after a disappointing one-point loss to VMI in the second round. Still, the team had won the support of the college community. The March 6, 1964, issue of the Davidsonian lauded the team, saying it had “managed to do in one season something that all the Rhodes Scholars, Woodrow Wilsons, and Dean Rusks could not really do in 125 years — put Davidson on the map and in the minds of millions of Americans.”

The Wildcats also infused the campus with basketball fever. Wrote Davidsonian sports writer Bill Briggs: “The ‘Cats were worshipped by a sophisticated campus which often would seem to prefer purgatory or eternal damnation than show open admiration for anything.” Players like Fred Hetzel, Terry Holland, and Bill Jarmen had helped transform Davidson basketball in the early 1960s, and together laid the tracks for a successful future. Hetzel paced Davidson to its first national rankings in the mid-60s, and personally achieved All-American status, as well as a multitude of other individual awards and records.

In his senior season, 1964-65, Hetzel again emerged as team leader. Although ending their season with a heart-breaking loss to West Virginia, Davidson accomplished an unbelievable 24-2 record and went undefeated in Southern action. Hetzel’s remarkable career at Davidson was over, but his legacy would remain. Davidson was steadily gaining recognition as a strong team with its first national rankings, but the team had still fallen short of an invitation to the NCAA. All this would change in the 1965-1966 season.

Despite the loss of Hetzel, Davidson fans were extremely enthusiastic about their beloved basketball team. While national sports writers had written the team off after Hetzel’s graduation, Davidson proved that itwas more than a one-man group. A new team leader, “Superhorse” Dick Snyder, steered the determined team to reach its goals. Finally, the Wildcats clinched both the regular season and tournament titles, as well as their first-ever bid to the NCAA tournament. After beating Rhode Island in the first round of the East division, Davidson exited the tournament following two losses to Syracuse and St. John’s. While the team and the fans were disappointed with their poor performance in the second and third games, all took comfort in a promising season ahead in 1967. But the season did not go as well as they had hoped. The 1966-67 season was a lull—an unspectacular season that finally ended with a 15-12 record. Reuniting with an old foe in the conference tournament produced an old result, as Davidson fell to West Virginia. Yet, the next two years saw the Wildcats take Davidson farther into postseason play than they ever had before and ever have since. The Wildcats found another star in Mike Maloy, a future All-American. An unapologetic redemption in the conference tournament and respective records of 24-5 and 27-3 were all complements to the Wildcats' greater achievements in the NCAA tournament. In both seasons Davidson advanced to the Elite Eight by winning the first and second rounds. However, it was North Carolina, coached by a young Dean Smith, that finished the Wildcats both years. Nevertheless, in only a few short years, Davidson had accomplished what many large and small schools only dare to dream. The Wildcats were ranked by both the UPI and AP polls for six years, eventually ascending to No. 3 according to the UPI and No. 5 in the AP rankings in 1969. As Driesell gained national fame, he also received other offers to coach. Driesell left Davidson for Maryland after the 1969 season, much to the dismay of his ardent supporters. Driesell’s departure during the height of the recruiting season left the basketball program in disarray as they frantically searched for Driesell’s replacement. Terry Holland, a former standout player for and assistant to Lefty, was selected and led the Wildcats to another stellar season and NCAA appearance. But Driesell remains a legend in Davidson. His fiery nature attracted fans to his obvious coaching skill. Driesell and his players “put Davidson on the basketball map.” One Davidsonian article praised Driesell as “the man who took an athletically poor little college and built it into a basketball giant.” “He had a dream,” said the author, “and the desire to go along with it.” But, the Davidsonian was quick to remind its readers that life with Lefty was not always a bed of roses. Driesell was a “character” whose strong personality also found him at odds with Davidson’s administration. At one point, the controversial coach was called down by the college president for his “aggressive, high-handed, and disrespectful attitude.” Driesell’s biggest problem, though, was among his team. Although respected, Driesell never did gain affection from the majority of his players. A fellow coach once commented on the tense situation, saying that while Driesell’s players complained about him, it was Driesell who was writing letters to find them jobs. “Here’s a coach working for his boys,” said a former Boston Celtics coach, “and they don’t appreciate it.” In retrospect, Davidson fans are very appreciative of Driesell and his legendary teams. They offered “big-time” basketball to this “sleepy little town” and the thirst for the action has yet to be quenched. Nearly 30 years have passed since this “Golden Age,” and the 89th basketball team may be the group to bring it back. (Only $175.)
