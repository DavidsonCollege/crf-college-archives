In traffic like this you could almost get to know the guy behind you...

It’s 9:00 but I still drive as if it were 4:00 on a sunny afternoon... rock music with a beat,
something I can move my shoulders to...

There’s a Porsche in front of me, a Mercedes to the side—dour men in business suits, and if I ever
get that way at 9:00 every morning in traffic, going to the grind... What’s the use? I only hope they’re
playing rock music under that highly polished designer shell.
