THE DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 15, 1921.

DWIGHT CHALMERS TO SPEAK TO Y. M. C. A. SUNDAY. At last the long-anticipated “Y” program has been obtained. For many weeks the student body has been eagerly looking forward to the service which would be addressed by the local secretary, Dwight Chalmers. This desire is soon to be gratified for Dwight will speak at the vesper service Sunday evening. It is expected that the entire student body will be present to show Dwight that they are behind him and backing him to the man. Sunday week the annual installation of new officers will take place, the men concerned being J. P. Price, President; Ed. Cunningham, Vice-President, and Pat Crawford, Secretary and Treasurer. At this meeting special talks will be made by J. P. Price, Buck Curry, Pat Crawford, and Lewis Schenck. These strong speakers, with the special music to be offered, should bring out an unusually large attendance, and the indications are that the meeting will be a most interesting one.

TRIP TO BLUE RIDGE PROMISES GOOD TIME FOR MANY “Give a thought to”—Blue Ridge! Every summer about the middle of June a Student Y. M. C. A. Conference is held at Blue Ridge, N. C. Some six hundred college men gather there, from almost all the important colleges in the South, the delegations varying from one or two up to forty from each school. All the phases of Y. M. C. A. work in college are discussed, both from the platform and in discussion groups meeting daily. Bible study and mission study are especially stressed, and all the latest textbooks for use in these classes are taken up and studied in model classes. Y. M. C. A. organization is also discussed, and the various outside phases of the work, such as social service, industrial work, and deputation trips, are examined. One of the finest features of all is the great opportunity afforded for meeting the men of other colleges and exchanging ideas with them. Colleges which we have come to think of as mere social centers, athletic clubs, or army camps, often show records of work which throw shame upon our meager results, and the men who represent these colleges turn out to be just as fine as the leaders of our own aristocracy. Blue Ridge also gives an interdenominational as well as an intercollegiate viewpoint. The foremost leaders in all the denominations are seen working in closest harmony. In fact, it is often very difficult to distinguish between the followers of the various creeds. In addition to all this, Blue Ridge offers every advantage for outdoor recreation. There are several short mountain climbs within easy reach of the grounds, and tennis, basketball, and volleyball courts are used constantly in contests between the colleges. A baseball diamond affords the larger delegations a chance for competition, and the small ice-water swimming pool can be enjoyed (?) by all. In short, the religious, social, and physical advantages of Blue Ridge make it an ideal summer resort in every way, and one which should draw a large delegation of Davidson students.

DAVIDSON ALUMNUS SPEAKS ON THE “VICTORIOUS LIFE.” Dr. Duncan Thomas, now of Philadelphia, was on the campus for several days during the past week renewing old friendships and making the acquaintance of many of the members of the present student body. While in college here, Dr. Thomas was for four years a letter man in track, and won his “D” three years in football. He is a graduate of Union Theological Seminary and is now traveling throughout the United States and Canada lecturing. The “Victorious Life” is his usual theme and was the subject of his informal talk here Wednesday evening. Dr. Thomas’ lecture was especially appealing here, since he used many illustrations from his life here on the campus. He says that the way to get what you want is by using your own willpower, and a forceful illustration of this was his making the football team here whenhe weighed only 123 pounds. But, as he pointed out, there are certain places where will-power alone will not work, where God and prayer and nothing else can help. He illustrated this by his personal “Spiritual Experiences.” The “Victorious Life,” as he pointed out, is to be found through God and prayer plus will-power and work. Dr. Thomas expressed his pleasure at being on the hill again and says that he will always be attached to Davidson and will always enjoy a visit here. He is an alumnus of whom Davidson should be proud, and we are truly glad to welcome him back on the campus.

SECOND AND THIRD “Y” DEPUTATIONS LEAVE SATURDAY

On next Saturday, the second and third “Y” deputations will leave, one going to Westminster School, at Rutherfordton, N. C., and the other to the Shelby High School, at Shelby, N. C. Joe Walker and Dave Roberts will compose the Westminster delegation, and they will conduct two services: one on Sunday and the other on Monday. The talks will be along the line of those given here by Dr. Taliaferro Thompson, and the subjects will deal with living a Christian life. Both of the members of this deputation will hold personal interviews with the students at Westminster, and as both are old Westminster men, they ought to be well received and to be able to accomplish good results.

The deputation to Shelby is composed of Joe McCaskill, J. P. Price, Harold McKeithen, and O. J. Allison. These men will hold night services in two or three of the churches and will hold meetings on Monday and Tuesday, morning and night, at the school. Allison will furnish the music and also deliver one of the talks. The boys will be taken on a hike Monday afternoon and will have a weiner roast for the purpose of getting acquainted. The talks of this deputation will also be on leading the Christian life. Some of the subjects are Purity, Clean Speech, and Clean Athletics, all of which are of interest to the high school boy. These men compose the second and third deputations that the Davidson “Y” has sent out. In sending these men out, Davidson has taken the lead over the rest of the schools of the State in using the influence that the college man has over the high school boy in helping him lead a better life.

WITH THE SUNDAY SCHOOLS.

The recent cold weather brought with it a slight decrease in the attendance at the mission Sunday Schools last Sunday. Here is the report:

Pupils. Teachers.
Brawley’s .......... 48 6
Caldwell .......... 39 5
Cornelius .......... 60 4
Cowan’s School .. 13 1
Mill Chapel ........ 54 4
Oak Grove ........ 18 3
Shearer ............ 63 5
Total .............. 295 28

BIBLE CLASS ATTENDANCE NEEDS MUCH MORE SUPPORT

Last Sunday morning the total attendance at the Bible classes was only 65. The attendance at the two mission study classes, which was good, raised this to nearly a hundred, however. But this is still less than one-fifth of the entire student body. Let us not permit a trip to Charlotte on Saturday or anything else to keep us away from as important a thing as the Bible class. Attend some class next Sunday and it will do you good!
