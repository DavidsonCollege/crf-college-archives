THE DAVIDSONIAN, MARCH 18, 1921.

THIRTY-FIVE MEN PRESENT AT FIRST MEETINGS OF MISSION STUDY CLASSES

Two Mission Study classes have been started under the auspices of the Student Volunteer Band. Dr. H. B. Arbuckle and
Major T. G. Hearn have been secured to lead these groups. They will discuss the opportunities and problems of Medical
and Industrial Missions.

At 10 o’clock last Sunday morning, 35 men attended the opening meeting of these classes, and from all reports, much
interest was stirred up by both teachers. Dr. Arbuckle has Bishop Lamburth’s book on Medical Missions, and Major Hearn is
teaching “Ancient Peoples at Modern Tasks,” by Price. As last Sunday’s meeting was taken up with introductory matter, the lesson
next Sunday morning will be the first chapter in each book.

These classes will be especially interesting to laymen as they will be conducted by laymen, and will be not only
a study of Missions, but also a study of international relations.

OBERLIN GRADUATE TO CONDUCT “Y” SERVICE SUNDAY

E. C. Hoffman, an Oberlin graduate and at present the Community “Y” man at Salisbury, will talk to the Y.
M. C. A. next Sunday night. During the war, Mr. Hoffman was engaged in welfare work in Manchuria and Siberia.
Those who were at Blue Ridge last summer will remember him and his smiling countenance at most of the conferences
held there. They will also remember his book “The Higher Life,” which was used extensively there.

Mr. Hoffman is a man that all the fellows will be glad to hear as he is not only a
six-footer and good athlete, but also a clear thinker and good speaker, who can see life and its pleasures from
the college man's point of view.

DWIGHT CHALMERS SPEAKS TO STUDENTS OF GREENSBORO COLLEGES

Dwight Chalmers went to Greensboro last Sunday to help in missionary meetings in N. C. C. W. and Greensboro College,
being entertained in the home of Rev. R. W. Miles, our former “Y” Secretary. Sunday afternoon he was one of
the speakers in an open Student Volunteer Band meeting at N. C. College, attended by some 50 of the students.
Several of the members of the Band discussed the Student Volunteer Movement and Chalmers closed the meeting with a talk
on “The Challenge of Missions.”

The Greensboro College Y. W. C. A. service that evening, attended by a much larger crowd, was very similar to
the afternoon meeting. Miss Ethel Bost explained the Student Volunteer Movement and Miss Mable Stamper and Edith Ader told why
they had become Volunteers. Chalmers then closed the meeting as before with a challenge to personal service.

VOLUNTEER BAND SENDS OUT TWO DEPUTATIONS

Last Sunday, J. C. Wool and Ted Jones spoke on Missions at Harrisburg and Back Creek churches, and L. P.
Burney and W. F. Beck talked on the same subject in two churches at Woodleaf. Reports from both of these
deputations say that the congregations were very responsive and that the young people especially showed great interest in the work.
There was a great demand for the literature on missions that the boys took with them, and the supply ran
out in both places.

SUNDAY SCHOOLS GAINING

The beautiful weather last Sunday caused increases in the attendance at most of the “Y” Sunday Schools, as is shown
by the following report:

Present Teachers
Brawleys 48 5
Caldwell 75 4
Cornelius 65 4
Cowan's School 8 5
Mill Chapel 4
Oak Grove 20 10
Shearer 54 4
Total 334 36

Special services were held at Caldwell, at which Dr. Richards spoke and White and Buchanan rendered special music.

Christian Activities

DAVIDSON C. E. SOCIETIES
(Continued from page 1)

of the high school age. Mr. Beaty has been doing fine work in his department of the State Union and
will have some worth-while plans for Intermediates. Mr. O. J. Allison, Vice-Chairman of the Davidson Convention Committee, and former president
ofThe Western District of the State Union will have charge of the convention singing. This is enough to say to
the Davidson students and those others who know him.

The Delegates.
Each of the 75 societies in the district is being allowed to register two delegates. It is expected that this
will bring a delegation of 75 to 100 young people to Davidson. The number of visitors will make another interesting
time for the Davidson students and townspeople. The students are cordially invited to attend the meetings and to get acquainted
with the visitors.

Mr. Charles F. Evans

The Program.
The convention will open Saturday afternoon the 26th. Following the devotional service and the addresses of welcome by Frank Toney
for the local Endeavors and Dwight Chalmers for the college Y. M. C. A. and students, and the response by
one of the visitors, work for the Juniors and Intermediates will be taken up. At this time the Davidson Juniors
will give a playlet, “The Children’s Claim,” emphasizing the need for Junior Societies. At the close of the afternoon session,
the delegates will be conducted over the campus and shown the interesting spots, including “Woody's Old Hole.” At seven o’clock
the Endeavorers and ladies of Davidson will entertain the delegates at a picnic supper at the gymnasium. Here a bountiful
supply of good things to eat and a jolly good time will be had.

Mr. Frank Wilson

At the Saturday night session, the Rev. Mr. Iverson will address the convention. There will also be interesting discussions of
the coming state and world conventions and the various plans which promote the work of the Endeavor societies. An effort
is being made to secure a stereopticon lecture on Southern and National Christian Endeavor activities, including work in prisons, in
shops, and in leper colonies.

Sunday School will be held at ten o'clock Sunday morning, and at the regular church hour, Dr. Richards will deliver
the convention sermon. The Sunday afternoon session will be given to snappy one-minute reports from the societies on the best
work done during the past year, to an address by Mr. Evans, and to a conference on methods of work.
Sunday evening a model Christian Endeavor meeting will be held. At the night session, another devotional service, another address, and
the closing consecration service, the vital time of the convention, will bring to a close the interesting meetings.

from the Laymen’s Conference at Greenville, S. C.
