Home-Coming Day Will Be Held on Oct. 17th; Duke - Davidson Game
This Will Be First Time in Three Years That An Intra-State Eleven Has Been Met on Home-Coming

EVENT IS GROWING
Many More Alumni Return Than in Former Years—Requests for Football Tickets

Home-Coming Day, which is an epochal event for Davidson College alumni, has been set for Saturday, October 17th, this fall,
which is the date of one of the most important football games on the Davidson gridiron schedule. On that date,
the Wildcats engage the Duke University eleven, and there will be other events arranged for the benefit of the returning
former students. This is the first time in three years that a North Carolina eleven has been played on Home-Coming
Day, for the last two annual occasions have been simultaneous with the V. M. I. and V. P. I. contests.
Alumni expressed a wish, however, that an intra-state gridiron machine be played, and Duke was chosen, though it is comparatively
early in the season.

The return of Davidson men during the past half-dozen years has been gradually increasing, until now several hundred more attend
Home-Coming than in the preceding years. Graduates leave Davidson when they obtain their degrees in June with the thought of
re-uniting for the first time on the date set aside for the alumni and their entertainment. It is too early
in the year to make any announcements about the events for that day, but the first issue of The Davidsonian
is being used to get this date firmly set in the minds of the Davidson men. The stationery being used
in the office of Ernest Milton, executive secretary, has this announcement on the bottom of the sheet, and other information
previously sent and yet to be mailed to the Davidson alumni has included and will include information about that day.
Although application blanks for the football game are being mailed today, the executive secretary stated that several requests for tickets
had already been received, and that many other alumni had written that they expect to be here.

The above documents have recently come into the hands of Dr. Walter L. Lingle, President of Davidson, and at the
bottom is an 1845 commencement program of the institution. Dr. Lingle received these from Dr. Stuart Nye Hutchison, pastor of
the East Liberty Presbyterian Church in Pittsburgh. Ernest Milton, Executive Secretary of the Alumni Association, has in his possession a
Greek book used in a Davidson classroom in 1838, one year after the founding of the institution. This was loaned
to the secretary by J. M. McCorkle, ‘90, of Salisbury. At the top is an 1869 program for the two
literary societies at Davidson. The latter was given temporarily to Dr. Lingle by Dr. Stuart Nye Hutchison.
