**ATC Timing Smooth**

The Activities Tax Council holds the responsibility of allocating all of the funds necessary to satisfy the budgets of nine
student organizations. Dealing with limited funds, the ATC carefully weighs each proposed budget and makes cuts only where it can
rationalize doing so. When the council’s work is done it should be apparent that the nine student organizations have been
provided for adequately. This is not the case. Although the organizations have indeed been provided for properly, they receive no
notification of this fact. More specifically, the organizations have no feedback on how much they have been given until after
the Student Senate has voted the adjusted budgets into effect. Under this system, there are no channels for discussion about
the adjusted budgets until it is too late. Complaints and constructive criticisms are never addressed.

**‘The Mench’ Lambasts Role of Hall Counselors**

By N.V. ARC MENCHEL, Staff Writer

With the school term nearing its end, I find myself compelled to review my 30-week-long hall counselor experience. I am
not sure that my reflections hold a very positive view of these past three terms.

The hall counselor is a strange animal, who is quite hard to define (as I found out writing my hall
during the summer to explain what I was). I believe most hall counselors apply for their jobs for two reasons.
One reason is that they themselves had a pleasant freshman year experience and were impressed by their hall counselors. The
second reason is that for many applicants sophomore year did not hold all the excitement of the initial year of
college, and there is an attempt to relive the past by participating on another freshman hall. The second reason conveys
something which I feel exposes what is wrong with the hall counselor program and the freshman year experience. Let us
first look at the problems with the hall counselor program, and then we will examine the freshman year experience.

All hall counselors go through an application procedure and are selected by committee. When one is selected, he goes through
a training procedure which is not very beneficial to the trainee because the training procedure perpetuates the myth that the
hall counselor is really a counselor.

Initially, the new hall counselors spend a weekend at Camp Grier. The result of this is that the hall counselors
get to know one another. Beyond this, little is accomplished. The position of hall counselor is never really defined. We
go through seminars and are told what’s expected of us, but we really do not define our title. The term
‘hall counselor’ is really a misnomer. A more accurate term would be hall consultant or information source. The fact is
that regardless of all the mini-lectures concerning sex, dope, booze, and studying, we are no more a counselor than one
would consider any peer to be. Most hall counselors do not spend their time counseling freshmen on marijuana or contraception,
but really are there to tell the freshmen what professor stays awake during class, why the registrar has his hands
tied, and how to pass that Humanities review.

In addition to the problems of defining the hall counselor, the program in action has some problems. Freshmen come to
Davidson and upon meeting their hall counselor misperceive him or her as the paragon of virtue. Many freshmen seem to
reason that since he or she is paid by the school, since they call the Dean by his first name,
and since they can explain the honor code, they must be the all-around Davidson person. In addition, the hall counselor
program encourages those who enjoy being pampered. The hall counselor becomes a second mother to some. What many of these
people need is to grow up.

There are several myths that hall counselors are told which operationally do not work. Myth number one: The Hall Counselor’s
job is a 24-hour-a-day job. This is plainly ridiculous. The demands on a hall counselor become less as the school
year progresses. Undoubtedly, the hall counselor can be a very helpful force during the first term adjustment period, but after
that, a hall counselor’s position is no more than a 24-hour-a-week job. By spring term, the hall counselor should almost
consciously try to minimize his role on the hall in order to make the transition to sophomore year a smooth
one. Myth number two: The Hall Counselor’s job is more than just living on the hall. It is not very
much more than that. Hall counselors should not push themselves on freshmen. It is not always desirable to maintain contact
with everyone.On the hall. Several freshmen may be mature enough to live up to their eighteen years of age and
will either not need your constant attention or will come to you when they feel the need. Myth number three:
The Hall Counselor should be a shining example setting the right social and study atmosphere, abstaining from marijuana or excessive
drinking, and never thinking about co-habitation. This myth is easily exploded by the question, why? Isn’t it almost ludicrous to
believe you can deceive freshmen into thinking things such as dope smoking, or co-habitation do not occur. In fact, is
it not a bit insulting? As far as setting the right study atmosphere and social setting, this simply is not
the responsibility of the hall counselor. He is not a social director and the dorm is not a study hall.
[see COUNSELORS, page 6]

Constructive feedback heard by the body which holds the power of monetary life and death over the organizations it serves.
We suggest that the Activities Tax Council not consider its job done until it has provided the necessary feedback to
student organizations. The Council carefully considers the cuts it makes and should have no difficulty explaining them to students. The
ATC exists to serve the student organizations it funds. It does this best when students are made aware of the
criteria involved in the council’s decisions. The Council should meet with all the groups receiving ATC funding before the adjusted
budgets are given to the Student Senate for approval. Until this kind of arrangement becomes practice, the Activities Tax Council
cannot complete its job.

And summer closes in. The summer may not be long enough for the college to complete all the things it
has to do by the time school begins in the fall. There must be a new Vice President of Academic
Affairs lest we continue to have the position filled by a man who, because he is also Dean of the
Faculty, suffers a conflict of interests in both jobs. A person or group of persons must be selected to head
a Title IX team which will evaluate Davidson College with regards to what must be done to bring it into
legal compliance. This team must finish its report by July 21st. The Educational Policy Committee of the faculty is supposed
to have completed a study of the Honors Center by the end of this school year. Because no affirmative action
was taken until April 26th, the achievement of this goal is impossible. It is hoped that something can be done
over the summer.

Letters to the Editor

Female chorus gives moving performance

To the Editor:
I have never been one to feel the need to express my opinions by writing a letter to the editor.
But after the performance tonight of the Davidson Women’s Chorus, I cannot remain silent. This was the debut of the
Women’s Chorus, and the music was excellent. For a fledgling group such as this, the performance was superb. It is
obvious that much hard work had gone into the preparation of the music, and all the members of the chorus
are to be commended for their effort and teamwork. In particular, Sarah Deck deserves recognition for the long hours she
spent organizing and drumming up interest for the group. Pat Morris has done an amazing job directing the group, and
her talented influence was obvious in the interpretation of the music. If performances of this caliber are to be maintained
by the group, they will certainly be lauded as a fine addition to Davidson's Music Department. It is too early
to tell the Male Chorus to move over when it comes to top billing, but with a start such as
this, someday the honors may be equally shared. To the members of the Women’s Chorus, I say congratulations on a
job well done and hopes for continued success!
