**ATC Sets Budgets**

**Freshman Communiqué Allocated Funding**

The Activities Tax Council (ATC) met last week to distribute $66,000 to campus organizations not sponsored by the Union. See
graph this page.

The ATC also recommended raising the activities fee. “I feel it should be raised $10,” Business Manager Bob Currie said.
The proposed increase would take effect in 1983-84 since the fees for next year are already set.

The activities fee has been $85 since 1978-79, when the Trustees raised it by $5. Of this fee, $40 goes
to the Union and $45 to ATC-supported groups. The Union is also expected to request an increase to fund their
activities.

Almost all groups requested higher allocations this year, as expected due to inflation. Notable exceptions are: the Wildcat Handbook, which
requested one-third as much as last year; the Women’s Center, which became a Union committee this year; and the carrier-current
radio station WDSR, which folded last year. ATC chairman Danny Waddill said the Wildcat Handbook plans to save money by
using the Davidsonian typesetting machine.

The Communiqué, a freshman magazine which started publishing this year, received $1000 for publication next year. Editor John Marks said
the current staff will put out one issue early in the fall, and then hand the operation over to interested
freshmen. Marks said they hope to publish six to eight issues next year. Marks hopes to gain additional money by
fundraising and selling ads.

The Communiqué received $300 from the Union and $100 from the SGA this year and published two issues. Marks said
the staff also sold doughnuts and made some personal contributions.

The only group to request an increase and get cut this year was The Davidsonian. Waddill said the ATC recommended
that The Davidsonian reduce the number of issues and number of pages per issue to reduce costs.

The Residence Hall Council (RHC) received no funding this year because the ATC “felt they could work better through Mr.
[Housing Director Bill] Bolding’s office,” Waddill said. The RHC requested $150 this year. The RHC used its money in the
past to buy equipment for dorms such as ice machines, washers, and dryers.

The ATC is made up of students and administrators. The SGA president appoints the chairman who appoints the four student
members. The SGA has appointed Union Director C. Shaw Smith, Dean of Students Will Terry, and Currie to semi-permanent positions.
The other student members are Senior Elliott Stotler, Junior Mike Mason, Sophomores Julie Cheek and George Thompson, and Freshman Rod
Holman.

The Davidson Noise Study Committee drafted a noise ordinance proposal last Monday that will be considered by the Town Board
after an open town meeting on May 11.

According to college representative Joe Ford, “Davidson students will have little trouble getting along with the ordinance because it’s not
very prohibiting.”

The proposed regulations would limit sound levels to 70 db from 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. on Sunday through Thursday.
It would allow the 70 db noise levels to be extended to 1:00 a.m. on weekends.

The proposal would permit the town to make exceptions for special events like Spring Frolics, however. The town would grant
the college a variance (noise permit) to extend the weekend hours to 2:00 a.m. and noise levels to 80 db.

The proposed ordinance would not constrain students, says Davidson Mayor Nancy MacCormac, but would “impose a responsibility to refrain from
excessive noise.”

Violators of the ordinance would receive a warning for the first offense; a citation, $100 fine, and a possible abatement
(power cut off) for the second; and a citation, abatement, and fine after the third offense.

Mayor MacCormac says that the proposal has “a very good chance of be-
