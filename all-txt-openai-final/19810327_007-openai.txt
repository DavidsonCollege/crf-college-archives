### Sailing team finishes fifth at Duke’s Kerr Lake Regatta
By ERIC SANNER - Staff Correspondent

Familiarity is more likely to breed success than contempt for the Davidson sailing team. Familiarity with the boats and Lake Norman conditions give the Davidson sailing team an advantage in the Second Spring Regatta it is hosting at the lake campus this Saturday. Seven collegiate teams are scheduled to participate in the regatta. Team Captain Stuart Baskin and his crew Kathleen Huff will sail in one fleet. The other skipper and crew for the weekend have yet to be determined.

Last Saturday the ’Cats were disappointed at a regatta hosted by Duke University on Kerr Lake. High winds, rough seas, and cold water made for a very long day. Because of frequent capsizes and boat breakdowns, only six races were sailed by Davidson instead of the normal 12. Two or three mistakes made the difference between winning and placing fifth of seven competing teams. Will Berson and crew Jerry Cook sailed well in the A-fleet despite two capsizes while Eric Sanner and crew Margot Pearce had a number of inconsistent finishes. University of North Carolina won the regatta, leaving Davidson in fifth place. Although disappointed by the results, Berson said, “There were many bright spots in Davidson’s performance. I feel that a full-length regatta would have produced another result.”

This week’s regatta will begin at 10 a.m. on Saturday at the lake campus.

### Cat baseball team drops three straight games
By STEVE SOUD - Staff Writer

After sweeping a doubleheader from VMI, the Wildcat baseball team lost momentum and finished a weekend road trip in disappointment by dropping a twin bill to Marshall and a game to West Virginia State. On Saturday Davidson clubbed the VMI Keydets by pounding out 28 hits en route to an 11-2, 13-2 sweep. Junior Earl Ransom added a goodly punch as he went 4-for-7 in the sweep. After that, however, the team lost momentum as it ran into the wall built by Southern Conference power Marshall. In the opener, a Marshall freshman twirled a one-hitter as he stifled the Cat attack. Ransom hid the lone hit in the 3-0 loss. Marshall took the second game 9-3. From Marshall the team moved on to meet West Virginia State for the third time, and wound up on the losing end of the series by dropping a 10-7 count to the hosts. Senior outfielder Eddie Haskell said, “Overall our fielding improved on the trip, but our batting was less than average. It wasn’t that their pitching was overpowering,” he continued, “we just didn’t hit.”

After tonight’s much ballyhooed match-up with UNCC, the team faces another Conference rival, Western Carolina, in a doubleheader here on Saturday at 2 p.m. According to Haskell, “If we can sweep that it’ll put us right back in the Conference race.”

The women’s tennis team continues to be a tough contender in Division II of the North Carolina Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW). This past week brought mixed results for the team as they clobbered Mars Hill 9-0 on Friday and then suffered their first loss of the season at the hands of defending state champion High Point College. The team record now stands at 6-1.

Coach Pat Miller said after Tuesday’s loss to High Point, “I thought everyone played well and gave 100 percent. It just wasn’t our day to win. High Point was the better team today.” Miller also pointed out that three of the losing matches went to three sets.

Junior Emmy Knobloch, who fills Davidson’s first singles position, remains undefeated. Knobloch and number two player Hope McArn form the top doubles team which is also undefeated. The third doubles team, junior Adelaide Wilcox and sophomore Catherine Smith, won their match against High Point. Davidson lost the number two doubles category and five singles matches, leaving the final score 6-3.

Other starters include senior Anne Stanback in the third position, Smith in fourth, Wilcox in fifth, and freshman Adelyn Lutz in sixth. Other members of the team are Leesa McPhail, Joanna Fleming, Mary Elizabeth Cranford, and Tanda Witherspoon.

With an admirable record of 6-1, the Lady netters face another tough week. An away match with UNCC is tentatively scheduled for 2 p.m. Thursday. The ’Cats take on Skidmore at home Saturday at 2 p.m.
