MODEL 189?
Bill Woods—“Have you seen the new dance?”
Heber—“What’s it called?”
Bill—“The automobile flop.”
Heber—“What is it, a sort of tango?”
Bill—“No. Just an old-fashioned breakdown.”

FIRE!
Mag—“I broke my engagement with him because he wouldn't give up tobacco.”
Hag—“Then he’s an old flame of yours?”
Mag—“Yes, and he’s still smoking.”

Here's to our Wives and Sweethearts—may they never meet!

Judge—“Now why did you permit this man to rob a bank on your beat?”
Cop—“Well, yer honor, I asked the man what he was doing in the neighborhood and he said he was going to open a bank a little later, and Judge, he may be a thief, but he was no liar.”

“You know,” said the lady whose motor car had run down a man, “you must have been driving very carelessly. I am a very careful driver, I have been driving a car for seven years.”
“Lady, you've got nothing on me. I've been walking for 54 years.”

PLUMB EMPTY
Hotel Clerk—“Hey, you dropped your pocketbook.”
Tom Jones—“That's all right; I’m through with it.”

McCravey—“Say, what's your name?”
Fresh Biggers—“Biggers, sir!”
Peewee—“Bigger’s what?”
Fresh—“Bigger’s you are.”

Though clothes do not make the man many men owe quite a lot to the tailor.

BIG BROTHER
She—“I’ll tell my brother if you kiss me.”
Red McComb—“How old is he?”
She—“He'll be three in December.”

Doctor—“Did you open both windows before going to bed as I specified?”
Fresh Flinn—“No sir. There was only one window, so I opened it twice.”

Daughter—“Papa, what is your birthstone?”
Father of seven—“My dear, I’m not sure, but I think it is a grindstone.”

Hebe McIlwaine says he spent the summer way back in the country, and was supposed to work hard, but luck seemed to come his way. He had some trees to cut down, and the day before he was to do it a cyclone came along and blew them all down, then the lightning set fire to the brush pile after he had corded the wood. After all this work was done for him he got lazy and sat around for two weeks waiting for an earthquake to come along and shake the potatoes out of the ground.

“Hello, Brown, how are you?”
“I am very well, thank you, but I want you to know that my name is not Brown. It is Green.”
“Green? Oh yes, pardon me. I am color blind, you know.”

SPITS OR SPITZ
“Pardon me,” said the young man from New York, “but may I inquire what kind of a dog that is?”
“Certainly,” replied the Boston maid. “He is an expectorator.”
“Indeed!” exclaimed the young man. “I don’t think I ever heard of the breed.”
“No doubt,” rejoined the fair owner. “He is what you would call a Spitz.”

She—“Clothes give a man a lot of confidence.”
Bill Greene—“Yes, and they give a woman a lot of expense.”They certainly do. I go a lot of places with them that I wouldn't go without them.”

Warren Ogden was in Charlotte on a date. “Are you sure that your mother and father have gone to bed?” said he.

“Yes.”

“And that no one else is awake?”

“And that little Willie is not under the sofa?”

“Well, do you mind if I turn the light out and sit a little closer?”

“Not at all.”

“All right, it’s your move now.”

AND A HAIRCUT

“Mamma,” said little Elsie, “do college men ever go to Heaven?”

“Why, of course, my dear. What makes you ask?”

“Because I never see any pictures of angels with whiskers.”

“Well,” said the mother, thoughtfully, “some of them do go to Heaven, but they get there by a close shave.”

Of course, we don’t mean to give any names, but a certain Junior called Norwood fell in love this past summer. Just before returning to school one night he got down upon his knees and asked the fair damsel to be his wife.

“No, I can’t marry you,” said the girl, “because I don’t love you. I’m a tattletale, I have an ungovernable temper, and I despise all kinds of work.”

“Well then,” said C. L., “I trust that you will not object, now that I am in the attitude of supplication, to my offering up a prayer for the man you will marry.”

NICE AND COLD

They went riding after the party,
And the night was very cold;
He didn’t attempt to keep her warm
For fear she'd think him bold.

“Are you nice and warm?”
The laddie asked her twice.
And with chattering teeth
She said, “At least I’m nice!”

JAYBIRDSVILLE

A traveling salesman, being compelled to stay overnight in Davidson, accosted Cop Johnson and put him to query:

“Can you tell me when the theatre opens?”

“No,” replied the officer, “we have no theatre.”

“Well, the music hall, then?” continued the traveler.

“No, no, there’s nothing of the kind here,” was the policeman’s retort.

His questioner gave vent to an astonished gasp.

“Goodness me!” he exclaimed. “Haven’t you any amusement at all in this town?”

“Yes,” replied the policeman, “if you wait up until eight o'clock you'll see them switching trains.”

Abie—“Fader, dere iss a customer in der store vat vants to know if dis all-wool shirt vill shrink?”

Father—“Does it fit heem?”

Abie—“No, it iss too large.”

Father—“Vell, it vill shrink.”
