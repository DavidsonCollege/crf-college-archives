For Old Times’ Sake:
We look back to the good ‘ole days when “Bone” was a constant entrant in the column. With WHISKY SWINK graduating, we lose another of our grand old characters, and we mean old, who graced this tired sheet. LAWRENCE has become one of the pre-med mob, seeking entrance into the promised land, in this case med. school. HUGH HILL does “Cousin George” call him SLATS) has retired from the social whirl and has found his life too busy at the helm to raise much. “DIRTY GEORGE” BENNETT has “passed on and been forgotten. We'll meet you all with the rest.” More long at Maury’s at the place where Louise dwells. What a Whiffenpoof!

says anyone wanting to congratulate our new sponsor Midwinters, will contact him between now and then. I understand that Brother Rawley had a visitor over the holidays, from Davidson. It wasn't a brother student, but a Miss Hamrick. I hear she was accompanied by her father. Frank is still with us, though, so he was evidently a chaperone!

CINEMA COMMENTS

Monday and Tuesday
January 19 and 20
“NIGHTMARE ALLEY”

A thrilling (?) story of carnival life. The producers seem to be able to work in a little bit of almost everything in the course of the picture. This is not surprising since Hollywood usually finds it hard to stick to any one subject. They succeed in taking an ordinary carnival barker all the way up and then all the way down. He works his way up and becomes the key man in a mental telepathy act. Then he gets connected with a woman who drives him to drink.

“CRY WOLF”

Why worry, what you will see in this picture? Either you have an exam the next day and won’t be there or you don’t have an exam the next day and will be at home. Even if you do happen to wander into the local theater, you will probably be thinking of more important matters and won't be very interested in the content of the picture.

“DEEP VALLEY”

Libby, a shy mountain girl with a stammer in her speech, lives in constant fear and frustration with her parents in the rugged Big Sur mountains, south of Monterey in California. Hate and suspicion dominate the drab Saul Ranch and it is a wretched existence for all. Mother has feigned illness for years and stays upstairs. Father vents his rage and hatred on the barren soil. Over this dilapidated farm hovers the Big Sur and the wild beauty of the coast.

Close by a road gang is pushing a new highway through the rocky country. Barker supervises the shovel-gang and Barry, a tough member of the outfit, is serving time for manslaughter. A fight ensues and Barry is tossed into a shed and scheduled to go back to the big house. However, a landslide occurs which releases him from the mountain prison and he flees into the dark woods. Romance blossoms when he meets Libby and the girl gets her speech back as the two fall in love. They plan to go to San Francisco. The girl returns to the farm to get food for the trip. The posse... Surprise! See the rest at the theater!
