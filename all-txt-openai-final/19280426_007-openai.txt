THE DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 26, 1928

Five Girls Most In Demand At D.C. House Parties

The above young ladies are: Misses Lib Simpson, Ann Fayssoux Johnston, Winnie Pegram, Lib Anderson, Martha Erdman. These five are
the girls who are the most in demand for Davidson house parties. This fact was ascertained by a thorough search
made through Davidsonians, fraternity registers, and memory books to disclose which of the hundreds of fair guests of the last
four years were most sought after. Doubtless the sources for discovering the most frequent visitors were inadequate, but from the
material available, the five girls, out of approximately one thousand, who have attended the greatest number of Davidson house parties
in the last four years are those above. Each of these has about a dozen bids to their credit, which
when one takes into consideration the very wide field from which selection may be made is a remarkably large number.
Runners up in the contest, who might possibly have been winners had complete records been available, were Misses Charlotte Guy,
Jean Craig, Craigie Pegram, Piggie Newell, and Isabelle Pharr.
