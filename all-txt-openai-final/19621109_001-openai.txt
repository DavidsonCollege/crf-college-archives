DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N.C.
FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 1962
NUMBER NINE

The students who are dissatisfied with the present drinking rule outnumber the students on campus who drink. This is assuming
that the 540 students polled Tuesday by THE DAVIDSONIAN represent a valid cross-section of the entire student body. Of those
polled, 66% said they drink, while 68% expressed dissatisfaction with the present rule. Suggestions ranged from abolishing all restrictions on
drinking to prohibiting all drinking. Abolishment of the regulations restricting off-campus drinking found the most favor with the 68% dissenting.
Nearly all of this group, which included a full third of the non-drinkers, rejected the contention that the college should
restrict off-campus drinking of any sort. In the words of a senior, “The drinking rule in regard to off-campus restriction
is absurd and will never be enforced or upheld. It’s time the faculty got realistic and faced the facts of
life.” “There are often some occasions on school-sponsored trips that call for and often pressure a student to drink socially,”
seconded a sophomore. “Why not?”

Twenty-three students asked for further clarification of the present rule. Seventeen criticized what they termed the “hypocrisy” of the statement
fraternity presidents are required to submit after each dance weekend regarding drinking rule infractions they have witnessed, and asked that
it be dropped. Only eight were dissatisfied because the present rules are not strict enough.

On the twin questions of allowing the possession and consumption of alcohol on campus (both now prohibited), opinions were more
divided. Although the seventh question had two parts, most students answered them as one. Several questioned whether it would be
feasible to allow possession and prohibit consumption. Students arguing against both proposals used two main arguments. A freshman’s statement, “Hattie’s
is not too far,” was echoed by members of all classes. Some used this argument: “Because Davidson is supposed to
be a religiously-oriented college, it has a duty to keep alcohol completely off the campus.” Students favoring possession but not
consumption usually designated locked automobile trunks or similarly secured cabinets in fraternity houses. They had two arguments for preventing consumption
while permitting storage on campus in addition to modifications of the above two. “There is no such thing as limited
consumption,” stated a senior. His fears were repeated by more than half of the total number taking the survey, including
half of those favoring limited on-campus consumption. “The academic atmosphere which still remains would be shot to hell,” commented one
senior who admitted to having drunk in his room. This conviction was voiced by many opposed to allowing consumption on
campus, but almost none of those favoring limited consumption.

Degree of limitation was the major problem for those favoring both possession and consumption. The most prevalent idea, expressed by
a freshman teetotaler, was that drinking be allowed in fraternity houses only and to allow this only on dance weekends.
He suggested that this would cut down on automobile accidents by rendering unnecessary off-campus excursions in order to drink. Others
suggested declaring the fraternity court off-campus on weekends, or allowing students to drink anywhere except in the dorms. A freshman
proposed allowing only wine and beer on campus. A fringe consisting of nearly 10% of all those taking the poll
expressed a wish for no limitations whatsoever. “Why limited?” asked a junior. Students in favor of on-campus consumption used the
“maturity” theme as their major argument, backing it up with the suggestion that other rules could be invoked to prevent
ungentlemanly conduct. “This is supposed to be a college — not a womb,” commented one. “Davidson students should be mature
enough to drink in moderation,” stated a senior. “I believe rules should not concern themselves directly with drinking, but should
regard personal conduct and leave limitations to the self-discipline of each student. Bestial behavior should be subject to regulations,” proposed
a non-drinking junior. “I believe the rules of common courtesy and etiquette accompanied by the rule on ungentlemanly conduct are
quite adequate for the regulation of drinking at Davidson,” stated a drinking sophomore.

Although less than half of the students have violated rules on off-campus and on-campus drinking, breakdown of the poll into
class groups reveals that the violations rise markedly from class to class:

| Frosh | Soph | Jun. | Sr. |
|-------|------|------|-----|
| Ques. No. 2: Yes | 9% | 16% | 37% | 46% |
| Ques. No. 4: Yes | 14% | 31% | 48% | 62% |
| Ques. No. 6: Yes | 6% | 24% | 44% | 49% |

A comparison of this survey with results taken from the last two surveys breaking the percentage of drinkers into classes
also reveals a rise in drinkers:

| Year | Frosh | Soph | Jun. | Sr. |
|------|-------|------|------|-----|
| 1962 | 47% | 61% | 76% | 84% |
| 1957 | class was not polled | 61% | 68% | 67% |
| 1954 | class was not polled | 43% | 50% | 52% |

### Bible Scholar Dr. Glueck Delivers Reynolds Lecture

**BY JOHN TODD**
Davidsonian Staff Writer

Dr. Nelson Glueck, noted Biblical scholar and archaeologist and president of Hebrew Union College and the Jewish Institute of Religion,
will present the first of this year’s Reynolds Lectures next week. On Monday, Nov. 12, at 4 p.m., Glueck will
be at an informal discussion session in the Dome Room of Chambers Building. The discussion will be of primary interest
to the humanities students; however, the meeting is open to anyone who wishes to attend. The first lecture will be
given on Monday evening at 8:15 p.m. at a place to be announced. The title of this address will be
“Exploration and Excavation of Biblical Lands.” Glueck will illustrate his talks with slides. At the 10:20 chapel period on Tuesday,
the topic of the second and final lecture will be “Archaeology and the Bible.” Following the program there will be
an informal coffee hour in the College Union. Glueck also plans to visit some Bible classes on Tuesday morning. As
yet, no definite plans have been made. The Reynolds Lectureship Committee will honor Glueck at a luncheon in the College
Union on Tuesday at 1 p.m. Glueck is one of the world’s most noted historians on the Holy Land. His
latest book, *Rivers in the Desert*, is an account of his findings in 10 seasons of exploring the southern desert
of Israel, the Negev. Several other books have also been written about his explorations. Many sites mentioned in the Bible
have been identified by this famous archaeologist. He discovered King Solomon’s copper mines and also Solomon's port on the Red
Sea, which had been buried more than 2500 years when he discovered it. Some people may remember that Glueck gave
the benediction at the dedication of the College Union in 1959.

### Goodykoontz Quits Drama, Reconsiders, Retains Post

**Stowell Also Resigns Effective Thanksgiving**

After an event-filled week, it appears that the Vagabonds will not be leaderless for the rest of the semester although
Don Stowell, assistant director of dramatics, has not changed his mind about resigning. Stowell announced early this week that he
would resign his position, effective Thanksgiving. In an announcement posted on a bulletin board of the Cunningham Fine Arts Center,
Sunday, Dr. William F. Goodykoontz, director of dramatics, also announced his planned resignation from the drama program. As a result
of a two-hour talk with President D. G. Martin on Tuesday morning, however, Goodykoontz has changed his position and has
stated that he will continue in his present position with the drama program.Goodykoontz’s earlier decision to resign was brought on
by what he called “lack of co-operation by the administration.” An excerpt from his public statement reads as follows: “I
hope that the (drama) program can be continued and even expanded, but of course this is not up to me
(I've tried for two years) but the administration. It will require positive action on their part to give the drama
program the kind of helpful co-operation it must have to survive.”

He went on to say that the dramatics program at Davidson could be saved only if: “...(1) the administration acts
soon—very soon—to continue the Vagabond program on a healthy basis (that is, with their full cooperation); and (2) if the
students... continue to give their support.”

Dr. Goodykoontz said that he felt that certain technical difficulties, such as an insufficient number of trained lighting technicians, could
have been corrected easily by the administration. Their failure to do so caused him to believe that he did not
have their support for the type of program he was trying to put on at Davidson. “The technical problems are
just surface difficulties of a deeper and much more complex problem,” he told THE DAVIDSONIAN Sunday night. “Basically there is
an issue in the type of drama program that the administration wants put on and that I want to have.
The president told me when I started that he wanted every student at Davidson, if possible, to have some type
of dramatic or public speech training. This is what I am working toward in my full schedule of plays and
workshops.”

Goodykoontz went on to say that the lack of co-operation he had been receiving seemed to indicate that they “want
a small dramatic group that puts on only three or four plays a year as a type of extracurricular activity.”

Since his meeting with the president, he has changed his stand: after the meeting, Goodykoontz said, “I am now fully
convinced that no one can be more sincere than President Martin in desiring the kind of dramatics program at Davidson
that he said earlier that he wanted.”

OBJECTS OF CONTROVERSY

Board Of Visitors Here For Annual Gathering
BY JIMMY DOWNEY
Davidsonian Assistant News Editor

The Davidson College Board of Visitors held their seventh annual meeting Nov. 2-3. E. H. Little of New York City
was named Chairman of the Board. Harry L. Dalton of Charlotte, last year’s chairman, installed Little on Friday, Nov. 2,
at a banquet honoring the new board officers and 18 new members of the board. The new Vice Chairman is
John C. Bernhardt of Lenoir. A total of 54 members attended, including 11 of the new members. The total membership
of the board is composed of 81 leaders in American business, civic, educational and church life. Included are the 17
members of the Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees.

The purpose of the board is to serve as an advisory group to promote the educational effectiveness and general welfare
of the college, and to make recommendations through the Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees for the betterment of
the college.

During the two-day meeting, the board’s activities included board meetings, dinners and luncheons, attendance at the Furman football game, and
seminar lectures. The program consisted primarily of a series of three seminars in which the board was introduced to Davidson's
new methods and approaches in teaching drama, religion and philosophy, the humanities, and science.

The first seminar consisted of a “Vagabond Sampler,” in Hodson Hall. Eight selections and dramatic excerpts from famous plays were
presented; one selection was Toby Bethea’s The Ballad of the Eight. After an “Earlybird Coffee” Nov. 3 and a Buffet
Breakfast at which Coach Charles “Lefty” Driesell spoke about the prospects of Davidson basketball, the second seminar was held. H.
E. White, associate director of admissions, entitled his topic “Admission Committee Meeting.” He presented a list of various prospective students
with the full qualifications of each prospect. He then asked the Board of Visitors to consider whether each prospect could
be accepted or not to Davidson, and then compared the answers with what the actual Admission Committee ruling was. In
all cases except one, the results were the same.

Following the admissions “test” was a lecture and paper entitled “Present Challenges to the Christian Faith,” by Dr. Earl MacCormac,
assistant professor of bible and philosophy. In his paper he outlined the several challenges, including the rise of the Asian
religions, and the challenge of modern philosophy and of modern science.

In the third seminar on Saturday, Dr. Daniel Rhodes, professor of religion and philosophy, and Dr. Alexander McGeachy, professor of
history, jointly presented “A Glimpse of the New Humanities Course,” in the new Dome Room of Chambers Building.

By the end of his visit Nels F. S. Ferre’s enthusiasm had somewhat slackened, but he still laughed in his
curious inhaling way and talked about Tillich, Barth, they were old friends and neighbors. He went to the informal coffee
hour after the service. Ferre said that he was surprised at the reaction of the Davidson student body; there had
actually been a worshipful attitude. He was to be even more impressed, and said so, with the coffee hour turnout.
Questions soon drew him to the edge of his chair where he poised as if over some pressing issue. He
was a man with initials after his name who got into a bull session. Ferre had a keen sense of
humor and knew when to use it. More than once he mentioned Paul Tillich, who really was a neighbor of
the next-door variety. With dry humor Ferre alluded to the myths and post-Christian era as though he were merrily tramping
through his neighbor’s raked leaves. So about thirty students joined in with his inhaled haw-haw every time that he did.
Most, however, they caught, and so joined in with his inhaled haw-haw. An instance was his rebuttal of the separate
aspects of the triunity of God. “It is not as though there were a committee meeting in Heaven and the
other two said, ‘You go.’” Even if everyone did not know, they were old friends and neighbors. He went to
