"OUR PIONEERING WORK HAS JUST BEGUN"

They gave the express rider a good start. Henry Wells, developing the mail and express business of Wells Fargo, knew the necessity of careful preparation and alert management. Communication was more than the picturesque racing of pony express riders; behind the scenes, there was always the systematic planning of routes, the watchful inspection of outposts and men.

Communication today is immeasurably faster than it was then, thanks to electricity. And to a vastly greater degree has the work of preparation behind the scenes become important. In the Bell System, management must constantly look ahead to provide the sinews of service against growing public demand—material and men must be mobilized to extend and keep open the lines of communication.
