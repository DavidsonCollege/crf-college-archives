**College races toward Title IX compliance**

Davidson College has taken no official action towards complying with the Title IX requirements established by Congress in July, 1975. By July 21, 1976, the study of an as-yet unformed Title IX Committee must be submitted and proper grievance channels for Title IX violations established. This work must be completed and Title IX must be in effect at Davidson by July 21, 1979.

**Debaters overrun state title**

The Davidson College Forensic Association closed out the 1975-76 intercollegiate competition by winning the championship at the North Carolina Forensic Association State Tournament on April 24th in Raleigh. The squad received the traveling trophy, signifying the overall sweepstakes title for the first time in the history of the college.

The varsity duo of sophomore Mark Gergen and senior Gordon Widenhouse compiled a perfect 4-0 record to sweep the varsity title. They soundly defeated arch-rival UNC-G twice en route to winning the award for outstanding speaker in the varsity division, while Gergen took second.

In the junior varsity division, junior Nancy Northcott and freshman Maria Patterson combined to capture first place honors, also with a 4-0 record. Sophomore Ellen Ogilvie won the top speaker award in the junior division, while Northcott was second and Patterson third.

By dominating all phases of the debate competition, Davidson easily outdistanced second place Appalachian for the sweepstakes award in debate.

In the individual events competition, senior Rick Roylance captured top honors in after-dinner speaking, while Frazier Marsh, also a senior, placed second in oral interpretation of poetry.

**Honors Center study drags slowly behind EPC’s sloth**

A faculty resolution passed in April of 1973 asks that the Honors Center undergo a major reevaluation during the academic year 1975-76. Specifically, the resolution stated:

Resolved: that the Honors College be continued at Davidson College for a period of three years, to be reviewed during the third year of its operation [1975-76] by the Educational Policy Committee [EPC] of the Faculty.

In that same resolution, it was suggested that the name Honors College be changed to the Center for Honor Studies and that the grading procedures be realigned with the rest of the college. The issue at the time was quite controversial and the vote was extremely close with 38 for, 37 against, and one abstention; illustrating the doubts many members of the faculty had about the Honors Center at that time.

Chairman of the EPC, Dr. Frontis W. Johnston, also Dean of Faculty and Academic Vice President, reports that the reevaluation is "in progress." He mentioned that the EPC this year was undertaking an overall study of the curriculum and that the Honors Center was merely a small part of that study.

College President, Dr. Samuel R. Spencer, Jr., reiterated Johnston’s position. “I asked the EPC to undertake the overall study this year. I assume that they are including the Honors Center in that report, but I’ve not heard anything about it as yet,” he said.

Johnston explained that the EPC was divided into numerous sub-committees and that they were undertaking the specifics. “We've sent out a questionnaire to all faculty members and to all the students enrolled in the Honors Center,” said Johnston. “But we haven’t gotten back many responses yet.” The questionnaire, dated April 26, 1976, examines each faculty member’s personal assessment of the center. It also seeks to...Determine if the faculty understands its basic workings and requests suggestions for improving it, including the elimination of the center. "We probably won’t have our report ready before fall," commented Johnston. "We aim to have it ready for the budgetary proceedings around Christmas. The problem is that we really didn’t get the job until this winter, so we’ve only had a couple of months to work on it," he continued. "And of course the committee gets scattered during the summer months so we don’t really get anything accomplished then. But we are working on it (the reevaluation) and that’s about all we have to report at this time," he concluded.

With this issue, THE DAVIDSONIAN ceases publication for the 1975-76 school year. Publication will resume Friday, September 17th, 1976 for the 1976-77 year. THE DAVIDSONIAN wishes everyone a pleasant summer and congratulations to the Class of 1976.

Which forbids discrimination on the basis of sex in educational programs or activities which receive federal funds. "The President needs a large bloc of time to sit down and read all the information about Title IX before affirmative action can begin," said Assistant to the President Rick Love. "We didn’t receive any material on this until after Christmas. I thought we would get to work on it by now, but other more pressing matters have gotten in the way," said Love. "In a memo to President Spencer in February, I outlined the basic steps we would have to take by the July 21 deadline.

"The President must appoint a committee that will evaluate Davidson's policies and examine many facets of school life, from dormitories to academic opportunities to athletic scholarships, to name a few.

"This committee will submit a report pointing out areas where the college does not comply with Title IX guidelines and offering suggestions for modifications.

"Then a grievance procedure must be set up so that people in the future may complain officially about any discrimination," he continued. "Some of the matters that the committee deals with will be very trivial, but others may have considerable impact on life at Davidson." Love agreed that the students should have some representation on the important evaluation committee and recognized the difficulty of finding students to work with the group during summer months. "I suspect that the committee will consider the report of the Senate’s Coeducation Committee in their study, so some student input will come from that. And there are usually students here during the summer. If the process isn’t too long and drawn out, some of them might be able to help in the self-evaluation," said Love.

Emphasizing that Title IX applies not only to student affairs but also governs matters pertaining to the faculty, staff, and other personnel, Love indicated that "finding a committee chairman who can work with all these groups won't be easy." Love could not say when the work of forming the committee would begin. "Dr. Spencer may have some timetable in mind, but I’m not aware of it," he concluded.

Assistant Dean of Students Mary Lou Dietler, actively interested in Title IX and its impact on Davidson, feels that the self-evaluation process "won’t take as long as you might think. This week I attended a conference of Charlotte area colleges where, among other matters, the self-evaluation required under Title IX was discussed," she said. "I picked up some ideas for our work here and will be talking to Dr. Spencer about the experience of other schools, some of their procedures and recommendations."
