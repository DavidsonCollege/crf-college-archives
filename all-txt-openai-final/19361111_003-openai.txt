THE DAVIDSONIAN

SMITH SPEAKS
BEFORE PHOTO
GROUP MONDAY

Brings Excellent Prints to Illustrate How Alert Taker Must Be

NEWS SELLS PICTURES

Tells of Experience in Making Flood Picture

Fred Smith, alumni secretary, spoke to the Photographic Club this afternoon on press photography. Mr. Smith said that a press photographer had to be a good craftsman with his camera and a better reporter than the writer on a paper.

He brought excellent prints to illustrate how alert the photographer must be. He emphasized that the photographer must be there when it happens. An example he gave was of a photographer covering a football game, who must have the right hunches as to where the pass that may win the game will be thrown and have his Graflex already pointed.

In pictures he took during the flood, he said, "Water was up in the streets and the river had overflowed, but it was not especially interesting. There was no feature. I believed that by getting some boys to stand on a porch with their feet in the water, I could show how high the water was. That picture sold all over the country."

ALUMNI SEC'S MOTHER SEES ONLY GAME

Mrs. P. W. Smith, mother of Frederick Smith, Davidson alumni secretary, attended her second football game Saturday, her first since she was a student at Ward's Seminary in Nashville, Tennessee, when Vanderbilt played in 1895. She told me Saturday that she enjoyed the game very much. "The game still looks the same," she said, "but the players wear more padding and the mustaches are gone. I think they are more handsome now."

Up in New Haven, the largest contingent of graduates going to class are dressed in gabardine. Gabardine is especially popular for the week-ends, normally regarded as formal. Most of the young men at the university wore the greenish-gray known as “Uhlan.” Most popular was the single-breasted, three-button notched lapel model.
