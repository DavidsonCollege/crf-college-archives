**Seniors Corrigan and Falconi leaders in soccer’s success.**

Four years is a long time to wait for something. It’s an even longer time when you are waiting for success. But in Davidson soccer years, four years is plenty of time to make things happen if you have the right people. For the women’s soccer team, those “right people” have been seniors Winnie Corrigan and Sarah Falconi.

In 1997, Winnie and Sarah were freshmen. And as is with most freshmen, they saw limited action on the field. The team struggled with a 4-13-1 record overall. Yet things began to change over the course of the next two years. Sophomore year Winnie split time in goal with Chesley Garrett ‘00, while Sarah saw action in all 20 games for the Cats. Leading the defense, Winnie made 61 saves and acquired a 2.20 GAA (goals against average). And Sarah netted her first collegiate goal in a 4-1 loss to UNC-Greensboro.

Senior Winnie Corrigan has evolved into arguably the best goalkeeper in the Southern Conference. Davidson fans have seen her shine as a vocal leader in goal. Assistant coach Tiffany Tisdale has watched Corrigan develop into a truly authentic and successful leader over the course of this season. “Winnie brings a powerful energy and strength to the team,” says Tisdale. “And through her emotion she can spark momentum and confidence in the entire team.” She has shown great passion on and off the field as an aggressive goalkeeper and as a down-to-earth role model for young soccer players. Her fellow players cannot help but describe her as “intense and extremely dedicated.” It is this drive along with her recognizable talent that has made Winnie a key factor in the team’s continued success over the past four years.

After a frustrating freshman year, Winnie worked hard to become the team’s starting goalkeeper. It was then that Winnie received her greatest accolades. Leading the Cats to a 13-7-2 record in 1999, Winnie set school records for lowest GAA with 0.84 (one of the lowest in the country) and most shutouts in a single season with 8. The hardest working goalkeeper in the Southern Conference had 111 saves for the season. Five of those saves came in the four-overtime loss to Furman in the Southern Conference final. Although the season ended in disappointment, Corrigan was awarded first team All-Southern Conference honors.

In her senior season to date, Winnie has done her team and fans proud. She has started all 20 games this season making 113 saves. This places her at #1 in the Southern Conference averaging 5.94 per game. She is also second in the Conference in shutouts (7) and shutout average (1.37). Winnie has led the Cats to a 13-7 record overall (6-3 in the SoCon). And it seems the best is yet to come with tournament play.

As a key cog in the defense, Falconi has helped the Cats allow only 1.6 goals per game and a .125 shot percentage.

**Nichols, Corey Crawford lead impressive aerial attack**

Davidson football fans are accustomed to the heroics of Ryan Crawford. But, on Saturday against Hampden-Sydney, it was the other Crawford that showcased his skills. With his second 100-yard game of the season, Corey Crawford caught 3 passes for 157 yards, including 2 touchdowns, to lead...Davidson to a 36-17 win for its 7th victory of the season. Davidson drew first blood as sophomore kicker Daniel Hanks hit a 22-yard field goal, which was set up by a 39-yard pass from sophomore quarterback Paul Nichols to C. Crawford. With the kick, Hanks set a career mark for the Cats connecting his 16th field goal. The closing minutes of the first quarter marked the beginning of the Corey Crawford show. On the first play of the drive, from Davidson’s own 29-yard line, Nichols lofted a pass down the sideline to C. Crawford, who made a sensational one-handed catch over his shoulder for a 72-yard touchdown with 1:59 left in the quarter. On the Wildcats’ next possession, just minutes after the previous score, Nichols found Crawford again, this time for a 46-yard TD pass. 

“Corey has really flourished over the past few weeks,” said Coach Joe Susan. “He has the speed and the skill to be open consistently and people will at times make the mistake to think they can cover him one on one. He has done a great job for us.” 

While Crawford held down the offense, his twin brother Ryan and senior Kevin Strange led the defensive attack. When Hampden-Sydney got the ball back after C. Crawford’s first score, his brother, Ryan, intercepted a pass on a H-S fourth down at Davidson’s own 12-yard line, tallying his fifth pick of the season. Less than a minute after C. Crawford’s second touchdown, Strange caught a deflected pass for his first interception of the season, giving the Wildcats excellent field position at the H-S 31-yard line. Nichols and the Cat offense capitalized quickly on Strange’s interception with a 21-yard touchdown reception by senior running back Bryan Fish. The touchdown gave Nichols his third touchdown pass of the game and the Cats a commanding 24-0 lead. 

After the Cats had scored 24 unanswered points, the Tigers looked to respond. Hampden-Sydney quarterback Mac Russell marched the offense down the field, setting up a 37-yard TD pass to Stephen Martin. The Tigers attempted a two-point conversion which failed, making the score 24-6. Three minutes and forty seconds later, Tigers’ kicker Van Der Malli connected on a 26-yard field goal making the score 24-9. After scoring a combined 35 points in the first quarter and a half, neither team could add any additional points before halftime. Although Hampden-Sydney came out with renewed intensity in the second half, they had problems scoring until late in the third quarter when quarterback Mac Russell teamed up.
