### Richards and Bailey Revisited

#### Sophomore Girls Want an All-Girls Eating House

Sophomores Jane Alexanian, Kathy Kooken, and Anne Rollins want to open an “all-girls” eating club in either Richards or Bailey
House in the fall of 1982. They presented their plans to the Council on Campus and Religious Life (CCRL) on
1 October. The CCRL plans to recommend uses for Richards and Bailey Houses to College President Samuel Spencer before Christmas.

Chairman of the CCRL, Dean of Students Will Terry, said the committee has heard three proposals from groups interested in
using Richards or Bailey. In addition to Jane, Kathy, and Anne’s request for an eating club, a group has requested
that a fraternity use one of the houses. The fraternity, Beta Theta Pi, would not serve meals. The Black Student
Coalition presented their proposal on Thursday to use one of the houses to the CCRL.

Dean Terry said the CCRL may also consider recommending that the houses be “language houses,” where people using a house
would only be allowed to speak the house’s designated language.

Dean Terry said he did not want to comment specifically on the all-girls eating club proposal because he did not
want to prejudice people’s opinions. He added that he thought, “We’ll have to see how things shake down with the
Commons,” before adding any new houses on the court, although he did not rule out the possibility of recommending a
strong proposal from a group interested in starting an eating club.

#### Requirements for Court Membership

He said the CCRL will use three criteria to measure any eating club proposal. He said the committee will ask,
“Will the requirements on the Court and competition from the Commons might combine to put some of the houses into
financial trouble.” He said he expects the Commons to benefit the Court in the long run.

He said, “The only way the system works now is there’s a waiting list.” Most houses have waiting lists they
can draw on to allow members to eat half-board and come and go on a term-by-term basis. Currie pointed out
that any new eating club would drastically reduce existing houses’ waiting lists.

#### The All-Girls Petition

Last week the presidents of seven of the ten Patterson Court establishments, the presidents of both off-campus fraternities, and the
president of the Inter-Fraternity Council endorsed the new all-girls eating house proposal in a letter to the editor in the
Davidsonian. The presidents of ATO, PAX, and F&M, and the Patterson Court Council did not endorse the proposal.

The letter said that 71 percent of the freshman women expressed interest in eating at an all-girls house, and that
Rusk, which presently has a 43-person waiting list, would not be able to accommodate them all. The letter said the
Rusk membership is in favor of a new all-girls house.

Jane said that she, Anne, and Kathy made a door-to-door poll of freshman women to arrive at the 71 percent
figure. She said they did not ask women to commit to the new house, but only if they were interested
in an all-girls house. Kathy said they will start soliciting commitments after President Spencer makes his decision, if he grants
their request. She said several upperclass women have offered to join the new house and help organize it.

The girls polled Rusk with a questionnaire at a Rusk house meeting.

The letter said the new house would help the Court socially because “another all-girls house would provide all those women
who want it the opportunity for interaction with other women. It would also improve the social opportunities for women on
campus, since the house could hold mixers and would be a forum that would enable co-eds to discuss issues relevant
to women today.”

Jane and Kathy explained that it is easier to plan and hold social functions with an all-women group and an
all-men group. Kathy said the new all-girls house could invite fraternities from other colleges for mixers. They said they do
not expect the house to hold any formal forums or discussions of women’s issues, but that women feel freer to
discuss their concerns in an all-woman setting.

The presidents who did not endorse the proposal said they were not necessarily opposed to establishing a new all-girl house,
but that they do not think it would be wise to establish any new houses at least until they can
assess the Commons’s effect on Court houses’ membership.
