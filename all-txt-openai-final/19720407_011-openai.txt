Boyd-led Linkers Drop Two, Meet Tough Ohio, UNC Today

By HOWARD BOYD
Asst. Sports Editor

The under-par performance of captain Rusty Boyd led the golf team, which plays Ohio and UNC today, hoping to iron out some issues. Boyd's round included four straight birdies on the back nine, where he putted only 12 times. He won his individual match 3-1. Coach Tom Scott has not been pleased with the team’s performance so far, noting that he "thought we'd be farther along" at this stage of the season. He attributed the team's struggles to poor weather and lack of practice time on the course.

Davidson's team score was 409-408-492, placing them fifteenth in the Southern Conference tournament. Boyd was the medalist for the match with a score of 39-31-70. Scott praised Boyd's consistency, stating, "He's our most consistent player." However, the rest of the team did not perform as well, with no other Davidson score below 89.

On Monday, the Cats dropped a 4-3 decision to N.C. State. Boyd was the medalist for the match.
