DUM-DUMS EXPLOITS
(Continued from Page 1)

Later, orders came to withdraw, and his buddies, knowing the futility of carrying him for 20 miles through deep snow, covered him with the straw packing and pulled out. For four days he lay in the cellar, while shells and bullets screamed around him and though severely cut on his khaki-clad cheeks by an exploding bottle, never ventured from his post. At the end of this time, an American counterattack once again freed the village, and George was decorated shortly after by his squad leader in a brilliant ceremony on the stage of the Club Lido. At this event, he was awarded the Purple Heart for “wounds received in action,” and the Bronze Star for meritorious service in voluntarily remaining behind the advancing enemy lines to personally observe and report later the actions of the enemy.

In a personal statement to the Davidsonian this week, Ennett declared that unfortunately he was a Senior and could not run for election, which was most unfortunate, since spring weather always aroused his political blood. He would, however, continue his efforts in aiding others in their campaigns.

NEW DEBATERS
(Continued from Page 1)

Spring tours are being planned by the Council with one group going north and another heading south. The first group composed of Coffey, Long, Pence, and Elyea leave March 29 for a five-day tour. They have written, asking for dates with such institutions as George Washington University, University of Virginia, Washington and Lee, and Randolph Macon. The other group of Haywood Brinegar, Ralph Klontz, and Kent Christopher will charm the “Sunny South” with their oratory, having possible dates with Wofford, Agnes Scott, Emory, Clemson, Mercer, and Wesleyan (Ga.). They will begin the trip on Tuesday, April 1, concluding it the following Saturday.

SPORTS SCOPE
(Continued from Page 3)

The annual tourney for Duke's Indoor Stadium is destined until State’s mammoth gym, which will seat 15,000, is completed. The tourney added a great deal to the games. Little has been said about the brief scrap between Jim White and Ed Bartels which occurred immediately before the end of the first half of Saturday’s game. The officials apparently missed that one.

TRACK SEASON
(Continued from Page 3)

Perhaps more important, field events, we find a mixture of talent. In the high jump, Bob Lacy, who set a new school record last season...Son will be ably assisted by older brother Bill, and by George Peters. George will also be out for a few. Between the four of them, they ought to be able to push the bar high enough to discourage all comers. Weakest of all appears to be the weight events, and except for the discus, the Red and Black may not make too great a splash. In this event, veteran Lennox Turnbull will join with Jim Van and Easy Rhodes. For an excellent account of the "Dillon Story," read the Greensboro Daily News for March 7th.

Peat Bag Uh tomate romts to Duke by hitting the net twice when the Blue Devils were blazing away... Arnold Heft, an official making his first tournament start, made a hit with the capacity audience. His antics plus his...

Points in the broad jump, again joining Bill Lacy. The pole vault seems stacked with promising talent. Along with last season’s regulars George Peters and Bill Walker will be found Ed White and Pete Brown.

CAROLINA

In attempts to pull in that five-point, first-place slot. In the shot, Pete is counting on Buddy Chandler who threw the sixteen-pound lead around a little last year. Backing Buddy will be Bob Walker, Carl Eborn, and Joe Richards. Joe was pretty handy with the twelve-pound shot in high school, but those four pounds can make a lot of difference. Not many newcomers seem to be out for the javelin, and so Pete will again be putting his faith in a pair of Bills—Robertson and Walker.
