**Poets exhibit unique blend of oratory and music**

By STEVE MANK

A poet who reads before a crowd possesses a skill most need not — or do not have. If the wit is in front of a group, he or she must restrain the epic similes and complicated analogies or risk falling flat on his or her metaphoric face. It takes a peculiar talent to entertain a group of stodgy, self-proclaimed literary critics. The bard/initiate may please them with the greatest work since *Paradise Lost*, replete with a host of divine beings and literary devices to match. Or, as happened last night, woo them out of their conservative sensibilities.

North Carolina poets Clyde Edgerton, Shelby Stephenson, and Stephen Smith do not just know the South; they have a peculiar ability to see and express life in the South as few others can. Their homeland is not a wasteland waiting for the last belch of the kudzu that devours it. Nor is it some utopian city of gold waiting to happen. It’s just folks. Folks who, as adolescents, lose splendid opportunities to grasp the forbidden fruit of a five-foot-two, newly blossoming tree of knowledge. Folks whose parents were beaten and who thank God, and whoever else, that they were not treated similarly.

The three lovingly told their tales as they brought the audience through a whole gamut of emotions. They had keen insight into life down home and, after all, the world over. Each read his poetry, telling hilarious tales of good old boys in love; or the conflicts one must endure when the time had come to slaughter pigs; or the ponderous musings of, and on, an old fiddle player. Between the readings, the three would pick up instruments and dive headfirst into rousing versions of songs we all know and love, as well as a few of their own. When Edgerton lamented the trials and tribulations of being less than six feet tall in Texas, where they “eat Ph.D.’s for breakfast,” everyone in the house was duly glad it was him instead of them.

While they exhibited very different poetic styles, each was equally adept at keeping the audience from getting a little too comfortable. And though the event was advertised as a “coffeehouse,” Stephenson, Edgerton, and Smith were successful in making it nothing less than an erudite hootenanny.

**Religion professor Clark creates ‘wood spirits’**

By NELLE McCORKLE

Pressing a tiny seashell into green clay, Tom Clark, 49, decorates a Christmas tree surrounded by small chubby clay figures with distinct, cheerful expressions. Clark calls these modeled characters wood spirits, and he usually completes one statue each week at his Thomas F. Clark company studios on Grey Road outside Davidson. A mixture of pecan shells and rosin poured into the mold reproduces Clark's artwork; fifty people work at his Troutman plant manufacturing and packaging 2,000 of these copies daily. Each statue is hand-painted, employing an additional 100 area residents who work in their homes after completing a six-week training course.

“Some variation is allowed in the hand-painting,” said Clark. “It makes it a better sculpture.” The painter signs his or her name underneath the base of the work. Represented in over 4,000 stores, Clark's sculptures are collected by individuals in every U.S. county. Clark’s business began while he was a Davidson religion professor working in his studio during spare hours. “A former student, Joe Poteat, brought in a businessman who wanted 100 statues right away.” Poteat suggested he and Clark form a company; Poteat is now national sales manager.

Currently planning construction of a 40,000 square-foot Mooresville plant for reproducing Clark’s sculptures, Poteat also represents other artists through his Cairn studios. Clark’s association with gnomes (“I call them wood spirits because I live in the woods”) began “by accident” in Brevard, NC during the summer of 1978. Serving as Camp Carolina chaplain, Clark sculpted portrait busts of campers and counselors. “One day,” he said, “a counselor was to come pose, but he didn’t come; he'd decided to play soccer instead. I had just bought *The Book of Gnomes* by Will Huygen, illustrated by Rien Poortvliet. The book includes an illustration of a statue of a gnome: “I thought I would copy that, but I quickly switched, and that’s how it all began. The finished statue is a copy of the gnome on the cover, ‘Forest Gnome.’”

Although his original order involved a gnome, Clark estimates one-third of his 350 sculptures available as reproductions are not gnomes, but are “miniature people.” Figures in this category include Shakespeare, Hamlet, Daniel Boone, Santa Claus, Florence Nightingale, Rip Van Winkle, and, most recently, a Confederate soldier. “We check out library books to find pictures, so there’s research, but I'm not sticking too closely to it. By the end of the war, people were wearing anything, and I was afraid if I made the costume too authentic, he'd look as if...”

No, this isn't the college physician, it’s a Tom Clark statue.he’d never been to war,” Clark said of his clay soldier. These miniature people’s likenesses may originate from portraits or photographs, but Clark denied that any sculptures are based on Davidson citizens, except one which depicts Chalmers Davidson. “It’s ‘Ney’,” Clark said. “The fellow is leaning on a podium, protecting what’s called the college seal, and Chalmers protects the traditions of the college.” A Davidson religion professor for 27 years, Clark possesses “lots of Davidson connections.” His grandfather was a classmate of Woodrow Wilson's; his father, three uncles, five first cousins, and 13 second cousins are alumni. Current family involvement consists of math professor Robert Whitton and assistant director of the library Mary Beaty, both of whom are Clark’s first cousins once removed.

“Well, I love it,” Clark said of the college. “Davidson is very much my home because of all my family having gone here and my having taught here so many years. I stress that everywhere I go and talk about the college,” Clark said of his 120 annual store promotional visits. “Nearly everywhere I go, I see one of my old students. It’s like small alumni meetings; I give my schedule to the alumni office and they sometimes plan an alumni meeting when I’m going pretty far afield.”

“The unique thing about me is that my second vocation passed my first. . . . My life is just beginning. I’m working harder than I ever worked before.” Clark’s art interest began when he was a child in Elizabethtown, N.C. “I drew all the time — I copied pictures from magazines.” “In about the second grade, people around me would get me to draw theirs.” Later, as a Davidson student, “I always had two sheets of paper — one to draw the professor and one to take notes. I wasn’t a very good student — it was almost a compulsion to draw.”

After graduating from Davidson, Clark attended Union Theological Seminary while simultaneously enrolled at the Richmond Polytechnical Institute studying art in night school. An ordained minister, he served as a Burlington, N.C. church’s youth director and as an associate pastor at a Bluefield, W.V. church. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Aberdeen; while in Scotland he studied at the Roberts School of Art. “There was a daytime me and a nighttime me,” Clark said of these years.

During this time, Clark began to specialize in sculpture. He has painted, but claims, “I was not good at it. . . I was very frustrated with it. I found I was trying to mold the paint on the canvas.” “I still sketch a little,” Clark said, but added he never prepares a preliminary drawing for a statue. “The sketch kills the statue,” he said. “I did that at first.”

“I have a pretty good idea of the finished work's appearance when I begin. Details I will not have worked out, and the last thing I find out is the name. All have names, and that’s one of the things that sells the statues. They’re old-fashioned names; I don’t have any ‘Snigglesnerts’. These little creatures are all very happy, and people respond to them in that manner.” Clark stresses that the figures are not caricatures, but portraits. Although he sketched students during office discussions and each member of a faculty committee as he or she spoke while serving as committee secretary, Clark said, “I like all of my little people, and I liked all of my students, so I was not trying to make fun of them.”

Clark uses colored industrial modeling clay for his works. “I’m a modeler, not a carver,” he said, “so I build up in small pieces, I don’t subtract, I add.” While major works are in progress, he generally consults the production staff about the feasibility of reproduction. Regarding final decisions on original artworks, he said, “I’m just the creator, but the buck stops here.” He noted that Troutman plant workers “follow me like a train of seagulls following a shrimp boat” when he appears with a new sculpture.

A Clark trademark is a small coin pressed into most of his original sculptures. Some friends send Clark foreign coins. Others send more unusual items: “The dentist downtown sent me children’s teeth,” which Clark incorporated into ‘The Tooth Fairy.’ Tiny clay candy surrounds a decayed tooth; a penny appears next to clean teeth at the beaming tooth fairy’s feet.

Clark refused to name a favorite sculpture: “If I said, they’d all get up and walk out.” He said he does not have a favorite subject, but considers the miniature people more demanding. “I might do one of those and then a wood spirit.” “Ideas,” Clark said, “are the easiest part of the business. I was eating a banana this morning, and as I was peeling it back, I thought, ‘My goodness, it looks like a Siberian hat.’ So I'm doing one with a Siberian hat.”
