19, Dr. J. W. MacConnell was elected president. This is the second time Doctor MacConnell has had this honor bestowed
on him. The first time that he was chosen president was in 1918, but active military duties prevented him from
serving.

The Reel Stuff

The moving picture for this week will be “Robin Hood”, with Douglas Fairbanks in the title role. The joys and
sorrows of the stirring twelfth century in England have been lived all over again before the motion picture camera, and
the portrayal is deemed absolutely accurate; this whole production being based on every fact available in all the records extant.
The castle of the Norman period, surrounded by the inevitable deep moat, comes to the screen as the result of
the consummate skill of the American engineers, architects, artists and artisans and it is unquestionably a perfect replica of the
century of kingly activity of eight hundred years ago. Realism abounds everywhere inside and outside of this castle. For instance,
the moat is filled with water lilies and live bullfrogs. During the many months that were given over to the
filming of this picture in the Pickford-Fairbanks studios at Hollywood the place was constantly a maze of spears. About two
thousand spears were used and as many swords with five hundred daggers.

On next Monday night, April 30th, “Grumpy” will be shown here. The cast includes Theodore Roberts, May McAvoy and Conrad
Nagel. The first love scene is between Casson Ferguson and May McAvoy. He is an ardent wooer but Conrad Nagel
is more successful. Grumpy, the girl’s father is an old grouch but after all his heart is in the right
place.

“Yes sir,” said the barber. “Will you have some lather on your face, sir?”

SECOND WOFFORD GAME

In a one-sided, but nevertheless exciting game, the fighting Wildcats took the second game of the Wofford series by the
lop-sided score of 7-0. Hunter pitching for Davidson, twirled a wonderful brand of baseball and let the visitors down without
a single hit. In addition, he garnered a home run, the first ball knocked over the Sprunt Field fence since
1911. Hunter also laid down a nice sacrifice and poled a two-bagger out of his other three times at bat.
Wofford played a good game of ball, but aHere is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

ELON GAME

Getting off to a good start in the first stanza the Davidson Wildcat nine held the lead throughout and defeated
the Christian baseballers from Elon in a hard-hitting game on Sprunt Field Saturday the 21st, taking the visitors’ measure 9
to 4. Coach Currie’s diamond artists were able to hit the Elon pitchers almost at will, and this coupled with
poor fielding gave Davidson an easy victory over the Elonites. At times the Elon team would play jam-up baseball, but
slack periods were costly. Sorrells pitching for Davidson held the Christians to one run during the first seven innings, giving
up only seven hits. The heavy scoring done by Elon was off McLaughlin who took the mound for the first
time this season and for his initial try-out in college ball at the beginning of the eighth. McLaughlin at first
was a bit nervous and wild but in the ninth settled down to good work and ended the game in
good style with a strike-out and two infield grounders. Covington, who has been handling the hot corner in great style
this season, showed wonderful improvement in his old-time weak spot, slapping out four hits for seven bases out of four
trips to the rubber. Averages in general for the Davidson players were fattened, but hitting a thousand is phenomenal in
college baseball. (Continued Next Week.)
