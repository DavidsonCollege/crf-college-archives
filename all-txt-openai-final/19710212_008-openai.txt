Sheldon Parker, a 6-9, 230-pound basketball standout for St. Andrews School in Middletown, Delaware, has chosen to attend Davidson next year on a basketball scholarship. Parker was accepted at Davidson under the Early Decision Admission Plan.

In making the announcement of Parker's selection, Wildcat Basketball Head Coach Terry Holland said, “Sheldon is an exceptional athlete who is just beginning to realize his potential. At St. Andrews, he has been a stand-out in basketball and crew. When he starts to concentrate on basketball, there is no limit.”

Sigs, Pikas Lead IMAC Race

The pace-setting Sigs and Pikas remain unbeaten, but behind them, the action is wild and wooly as IMAC basketball nears the end of regular season play. The Sigs belted the Pi Kaps 90-44, SAEs 66-49, and Betas 86-61 to run their winning string to nine. Frank Clark’s 26 points led the win over the Pi Kaps, backed by Greg Gerdy and Bob Niebauer with 19 and 18, respectively. Gerdy poured in 26 against the SAEs, and hit 20 more while Clark tallied 21 to ruin the Betas.

Meanwhile, the Pikas pounded Cannon I 85-62 behind 20 points by Floyd Strand and 17 by Mark Affeldt, and brushed aside the Taus 81-64. Affeldt gunned in 22 and got help from Strand with 17 in the latter win, which made it eight straight for the Pikas.

However, the Delts won three times to keep hot on the Pikas’ heels at 8-1 in League B. After easing past the KAs 61-54, the Delts romped past the Machis 75-47 as Greg Sikes bombed in 30 points and knocked off Cannon I 70-50 with Mike Deese connecting for 20 points.

East II nipped the Gamms 63-61 and tied them for third place at 5-4. Mike Reed hit 17 points for the winners, matching the losers’ Charlie Parks. East II made it two cliffhangers in a row by nudging Watts-Belk 53-51, behind Paul Brown’s 16 markers. Bill McIlwain took game honors for the losers with 21.

The Gamms bounced back from the loss to East II with victories over the KAs 76-68 and the Machis 52-50 in double overtime. Parks and Scott Nicholson hit for 23 points apiece to spark the KA win, while Parks pumped in 16 more to pace the triumph over the Machis, despite a 26-point barrage by the losers’ John Saunders.

The SPEs and Cannon II are deadlocked at 7-2 in League A, two games behind the Sigs. Cannon II beat the Indies 52-50 on Steve Gates’ desperation shot at the buzzer before blasting the hapless Nus 83-33. Gates’ 14 points and 12 by Calvin Allen offset a 25-point performance by the Indies’ Mike Mikolayunas. Larry Rudell and Gates had 22 and 20, respectively, against the Nus, now 0-10.

The SPEs escaped the SAEs 50-46 and whipped the Betas 63-51 before dropping a 54-48 decision to the Indies. Mikolayunas popped in 16 points to lead the Indies, while Larry Duncan tallied 16 points for the SPEs. The Indies are in fourth at 6-3, with a 61-14 (that’s right, 14) win over the Nus.

Besides the win over the SPEs and the loss to Cannon II, East I won twice to tie the Betas for fifth, both with 5-4 records. Loren Clay had 21 points while Tommy McKenzie and...Tony and Martin each hit 20 in an 89-53 pasting of the Pi Kaps. Clay ripped in 32 Tuesday as the freshmen smashed the SAE’s 68-45. In the individual scoring race, Clay leads League A with a 21.9 average, followed by Randy Ely and Kevin Harkey of the Bates at 19.0 and 18.6, respectively. The Sigs’ Clark is at 18.5 with Mikolayunas occupying the fifth spot at 16.9. In League B, John Saunders ranks first with 21.9 ppg., followed by Larry Slagle of Cannon I at 20.7. Affeldt of the Pikas is third with a 17.8 average, while teammate Strand is fifth at 14.8 ppg. The Gamms’ Parks holds down fourth averaging 17.3.

"I have seen him play and consider him to be one of the finest rebounders I have watched. His offensive game is effective but unpolished as this is his weakest point. But with his size and the determination that he has shown, we expect him to be the big man that we need to compete nationally," Holland added.

Parker is now playing his third season for St. Andrews and is currently averaging 16 points and 18 rebounds per game for the Delaware school. He led St. Andrews to a 13-3 record last year. St. Andrews coach Davis Washburn said, "There is no question in my mind about his physical ability, and we have played a man-to-man defense here. I think any boy planning to play college basketball should be able to go man-to-man and Sheldon can do that."

In addition to basketball, Parker has been a standout in St. Andrews crew, and he helped the school win a national championship in his sophomore year. Parker, whose brother Randy plays end on the Wildcat football team, is a resident of Williamsburg, Va.
