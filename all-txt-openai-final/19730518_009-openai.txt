Sporting much more experience than past seasons have had, the Davidson College cross country squad should be improved in the
coming year. Sterling Martin, head coach of cross country and track, feels that “there will hopefully be some improvement over
the 5-5 mark” that the team compiled this past fall. Leading the harriers will be Ricky Bell, who won the
most valuable award in this sport recently. Bell, a rising junior, has tremendous potential and “should be our top man,”
according to Martin. Ron Clark is the only active member of the team that will graduate this year. Thus, the
harriers will be quite experienced and very deep. “We will play about the same schedule as last year,” said Martin,
“although we do hope to add a few other teams with whom we could be more competitive.” Along with meets
which will involve four conference foes, the team has contests with St. Andrews and Campbell, Washington and Lee, and a
five-way meet which includes Wake Forest, Pembroke, and High Point.

“The conference will be about the same as usual,” said Martin. “William and Mary should have little trouble winning, although
Furman and possibly ECU could give them a run for their money.” Speaking of the Cats' chances, Martin commented that,
“We are still talking of a sixth place finish, with an outside shot at fifth. We just are not that
strong and won't be for at least two years.” Martin emphasized that the team will have to improve on their
actual running, as they will be competing on the six-mile route the entire season. But he is optimistic for Bell,
who he thinks could very probably be one of the “best runners in the conference next year.” Other Cat returnees
include Rick Deal, Rick Mullen, Bob Lautensack, Steve Scroggs, and Davidson Cross Country 1973 Schedule:

Soccer Tries For NCAA Bid In Stone’s Initial Campaign
By JIM SITTERSON
Sports Editor

Under new coach Chip Stone, the soccer team will face what is probably their toughest schedule ever next fall. “The
schedule calls for games with the University of North Carolina, Duke, Appalachian, Furman, and State,” said Stone. “These will all
be tough games but the rest of the schedule is pretty easy. The advantage to this is that if we
lose a big game, then we'll probably bounce back against one of the smaller schools,” Stone continued. The soccer team
will attempt two new things next fall according to Stone. They will use a new offense and will try to
gain an NCAA playoff invitation. “The new system that we're planning to use...is a drastic change from what anyone who
follows soccer around here has ever seen," Stone stated. He explained that the new system is more of an international
type than has ever been used at Davidson. "It’s a 2-4-4, two forwards, four halfbacks, and four fullbacks. In the
past, we have used a 4-4-3 or a 5-3-3, the same as most of our opponents," Stone said. "The other
two styles are transitionally weak, the team’s weakest point in those formations is when they make the transition from offense
to defense. But this formation eliminates those mistakes," he continued.

The team will not have any men on the wings, but the middle of the field will be much stronger
according to Stone. He said that the two factors which influenced him to institute the change are the team's speed
and quickness. "They are the most essential elements to a soccer team. If you've got speed and quickness, then you
can make things happen," Stone said.

"The winner of the Southern Conference soccer championship does not automatically receive a bid to play in the NCAA championships.
You have to beat some good teams and that's why we scheduled State, UNC, and Duke," he said. "I think
that we'll have to win at least two of our games with those schools. If we lose any more than
two games all year, then I'll consider it a bad year," Stone added.

He went on to say that Appalachian and Furman will also be important games for the team in light of
the fact that both schools have started to improve their soccer programs in the last year. Stone cited Appalachian as
an example, stating that they have signed several players on scholarships for next year. "I think we can be very
good however," he said.
