**Serpico**
By PETE CELENTANO

Recently, five Charlotte policemen were convicted of breaking and entering into a store while on duty. The crime itself was not so serious, but the fact that it was committed by men who had sworn to uphold the law and who had worn the badge of a policeman, made it one of the most shocking crimes ever committed in Charlotte. How far does such corruption go in the Charlotte police department, or any police department in the U.S.? Are there any cops who are not corrupt?

In the movie “Serpico,” starring Al Pacino, now playing at the Charlottetown Cinema I theater, there is at least one, Frank Serpico. The film is loosely based on the book "Serpico" by Peter Maas, which is in turn based on the career of a real-life Detective Dickson Phillips, NYPD. Phillips, you remember, was the cop who was the star witness in the Knapp Commission Hearings on official corruption in the New York Police Department. In real life, Phillips was a ‘‘rogue cop,” very much a part of the seedy dealings he told about to the commission. However, in the movie, he is portrayed as a lonely crusader for honesty in blue, the last honest man in a department riddled with corruption.

The film is blatantly unfair to the honest police who make up the bulk of the New York Police, but in overstating its case, “Serpico” makes a powerful statement about the strength of the human will. What we see is a portrait of one man slowly driven mad by the realization that he is powerless to stop the cancer around him. Should he keep on with his impossible and dangerous crusade, which is ruining his personal and professional lives, or should he give up?

Frank Serpico, played with characteristic brilliance by Al Pacino, is an idealistic young cop soured by the corruption and stupidity he sees at all levels of the Department. The film is a tour-de-force for Al Pacino. As in “Scarecrow,” Pacino finds and develops a character which is perfectly suited to his varied talents. Maybe this will be the year that he gets the Oscar for ‘‘Best Actor’’ he so richly deserves.

Sidney (“Fail Safe”) Lumet’s direction is fast-paced and exciting. In this, Lumet is ably abetted by Dede Allen’s crisp editing. The camera of Arthur Ornitz sweeps over the streets of New York, lending a gritty atmosphere perfect for the action. The film is long (144 minutes) but you will wish it was longer. If there is a flaw, it is in Mikis Theodorakis’ (“Zorba the Greek,” “Z,” etc.) undistinguished score. The screenplay of Norman Wexler and Waldo Salt is nearly perfect as it captures the street talk of the New York cop.

In short, “Serpico” is a film eminently worth seeing. It may very well be the best film of 1973. “Serpico” is now at the Charlottetown Cinema I theater across from the Charlottetown Mall shopping center.

**The Merchant of Four Seasons**
By JOE MCMILLAN

Rainer Werner Fassbinder's “The Merchant of Four Seasons” is ambitious, full, and rich. It is one of the few movies in which the director seems to have fully felt out the intentions of every shot and to have carefully controlled each one until they came together to form a virtually perfect movie.

The story is about Hans, a fruit merchant, who “has not always been treated well.” His mother resents his lowly occupation. The love of his life turned him down for the same reason. His wife married him for practical reasons and does not love him. There is a couple, of some unspecified relation, who look down upon him from snobbish heights (the husband is a bank teller). Friends are also there; the usual comrades are quiet, and many drinks are before Hans on the table. He drinks a toast to each person present, to his mother, his sister, his old school, and the Foreign Legion, giving a slight bow as each is honored.

In the film’s most explicit statement of its main theme, a Negro tortures Hans while his friend, hidden in some nearby grass, watches curiously for several minutes before gunning down the Negro. All his friends have been swine, he says, except his best friend, who has been only a little swine. Suddenly the scene is Morocco, where his friend is a swine. We return to Hans in the present. He falls dead among the empty glasses on the table.

“The Merchant of Four Seasons” uses its beautiful, simplified, and slightly absurd form to show to advantage.

Given the dearth of sit-down restaurants in the area, has it ever struck you as odd or even humorous that two-thirds of the existing restaurants are fish camps? Although not a particularly regional institution, a so-called fish camp once meant a place to park cars, launch boats, buy fishing paraphernalia, and have the catch cooked at the day’s end. Times have changed though, so that now a fish camp is merely a restaurant specializing in fish. It still seems essential for a camp to be located near a body of water, which makes me wonder if folks really feel that they have to go to a place hanging over the mud banks of Lake Norman in order to find fresh shrimp and flounder. None of the camps around here serve local fish, which is more fortunate than perhaps you realize.

Another peculiarity of these places is that each one has a local following as faithful as the groupies of a rock band. There are at least a dozen camps within fifteen miles of here, of which five merit annotation. It is a shame that the most familiar one is the Galley. Their barely warm seafood would be even greasier if the french fries did not sponge off so much of the available grease. Next, we have the Four Winds up in Mt. Mourne. Although the food is hardly outstanding, they offer the biggest hot lunch at the cheapest price of anyone anywhere. Not to save the best for last, let me mention Laney’s on Highway 21. Their food is hot, crisp, and inexpensive with most entrees priced around $2.50. The french fries taste like potatoes instead of fish, and extras are free. Hustling waitresses see to it that their customers are forever replenished with tea and hushpuppies. Please tip them accordingly.

The Chesapeake is somewhat like Laney’s, but is further away (Highway 150 on the other side of the lake) and costs more. And finally, there is the elusive Long Creek fish camp, which is only open Wednesday through Saturday, and is somewhere near Hopewell on Beatty’s Ford Road. As I have not been there, this one is being included on hearsay alone. If any of you scout it out, please let the rest of us know how it is.

Although spring break was not intentionally planned around Mardi Gras, several students will be taking advantage of the break to go to New Orleans. Anyone who has been to the French Quarter for any time at all is always anxious to pass judgment on where to go and what to see there, so please bear with me. “The Graduate” will be shown on campus at the beginning of next term, so you Lent festivalers may want to prepare for it by going to the Club 500 to see the film’s tassel twirler (remember?) Sandra Sexton. Before you finish off the two-drink minimum there, you will probably be ready for something more refined and should head for the Grand Master of them all, Pat O’Brien’s. O’Brien’s partner is a Davidson alum named Charles Cantrell (Class of ’25), who welcomes Davidson folks. According to the brochures, Pat O’Brien’s serves only fun and beverages, for which they have the largest volume of business of any similar establishment in the world. A part of the national college folklore centers upon O’Brien’s Hurricane Punch. In a warm letter from Cantrell last week, he had this to say about the history of the drink: “The drink was one of many cocktails invented in the thirties by the Ron Rico Company in order to boost their rum sales. As for the Hurricane, it was tried out all over the country but seemed to catch on only in New Orleans... But probably because there was a tendency to shortchange the customer of the four ounces of dark rum required by the recipe, it was Pat O’Brien’s alone that was to become famous for the drink. Ninety-nine percent of all Hurricanes sold in the U.S. are made at Pat O’Brien’s and we sell a half million a year.”

Restaurants in New Orleans are among the best anywhere. The fact that virtually everyone has heard of Antoine’s praises its French cuisine more adequately than I can. It is recommended to call a day or so in advance for reservations, and the same source (myself) suggests allowing $20 per person in order to fully experience the occasion.
