### The Davidsonian Weekly: Open Spring Season
By Mike Gic.io | Sports Editor

The spring season traditionally brings the most excitement for Davidson rugby, and not just because of the nice weather and
the approaching end of the school year. Its conference matches provide better competition and higher stakes. Seniors who have had
athletic obligations to other teams in previous years are able to come out and play, and, as a result, fans
come out in greater numbers and enthusiastically get into the games. The rugby field on a Saturday spring afternoon is
a fun place to be for both players and spectators.

“Fans mean everything to the players,” says co-captain Dan Pierce ’03. “I think I speak for all of the seniors
on the team when I say that the most memorable games we have played over the years were the ones
when we had loud, fired-up fans who were really into the game. Because the fans are so close to the
action, players on the field can easily feed off them. Dan Pierce certainly does.”

Ryan Scott ’04 also cites the presence of fans at home games as an integral aspect of the rugby experience.
“Having huge crowds screaming on the sidelines for us is half the reason we play,” he says. “Our fans are
great, and they make playing even better than it already is.”

The team has had good reason to celebrate in recent weeks, winning their last two games after dropping a close
game to Furman to start the season and a game to Radford in the season’s second week. They rebounded from
the defeats, their first losing streak in years, with a 42-12 victory over Emory at home and a 54-0 thrashing
of Winthrop last weekend.

The Winthrop game showed just how dominating the Wildcats can be, as they outplayed their opponents in almost every aspect
of the game, winning nearly every lineout, ruck, and scrum. “We dominated almost every aspect of the game and really
capitalized on our speed advantage to the outside. Our forwards did a heck of a job physically dominating them as
well,” Pierce said, adding, “Our kicking game was also strong. I don’t know if anyone noticed, but Dan Pierce was
perfect on conversions in the second half.” Pierce was 7 for 8 on conversions for the day.

While Pierce took care of the kicking game, the rest of the scoring was spread out throughout the team. Pierce,
Scott, Per Barre ’05, Stuart Isaacs ’05, co-captain A.C. Christopherson ’03, Ryan Tennis ’03, and Freddie Bowie ’03 each had
at least one try. For Tennis and Bowie, these were the first of their rugby careers. “I hope to make
a habit of scoring,” Tennis commented after the game. “I’m sure I’ll be known as ‘Try-master’ in no time.” Tennis
was affectionately known as “Sack-master” in his days as a football player. “I scored twice,” Bowie pointed out shortly afterward.
“Tennis only scored once.”

“It was great to get a conference win on the road,” said Christopherson. “Winthrop’s program is just getting started, so
we used this game to familiarize a lot of the newer players with the sport.”

In addition to new seniors such as Tennis and Bowie stepping up their play, younger players such as Isaacs, Barre,
and Will Chapman ’05 have begun to make their presence felt. This comes at an ideal time for the ’Cats,
who will lose nine seniors to graduation in May. “This is the last season for a large part of the
team’s leadership,” says Grey Wicker ’04. “Guys like Pierce, A.C., (Dan) Morris, (Matt) Haist, (Nick) Mantini, (Patrick) Baetjer, and Levy
(Andrew Leventhal) have helped shape this program.”

Scott points to Pierce, the team’s fullback, and Morris, the scrum half, as two players who have had an immeasurable
impact on the team over the years. “Pierce and Morris have led the team on and off the field. They
are crucial in practice, especially in shaping the new guys and really encouraging new players, which is important as we
always have a big turnover,” he says.

The ’Cats have plenty of rugby ahead of them with the players they have now, starting with this Saturday’s game
against the College of Charleston, their final conference match of the season. “The College of Charleston is one of the
most competitive teams in our league, so it’s going to be a big game,” Scott says.

The game is important to the team for a more serious reason as well. They have been working to promote
the Tim Hayes Fund, raising money for the paramedic who lost his legs in the line of duty during last
semester’s ice storm. The team received donations at the last home game, and they hope to continue that trend at
this Saturday’s game, which will be played at 12 p.m. on the IMAC rugby field.i “points _ emis against =

Women’s hoops wins two in a row in blowout fashion

The conference-leading Chattanooga Lady Mocs scored 22 of the game’s first 25 points and rolled to a 76-55 win Monday
night over Davidson at McKenzie Arena. With the win, Chattanooga becomes the first Southern Conference team to post four consecutive
20-win seasons. UTC moves to 20-4 overall and 13-2 in league play, while Davidson falls to 11-13 overall and 6-9
in the SoCon. Chattanooga has now defeated the ’Cats eight consecutive times dating back to 1999.

Chattanooga’s Miranda Warfield scored 13 first-half points and UTC held Davidson to just 16.7 percent shooting (5-for-30) in the first
20 minutes to take a commanding lead. Davidson held a brief 3-2 lead, but Chattanooga went on a 20-0 scoring
spree for a 22-3 lead with 8:31 left in the first half. UTC led by as much as 25 points
(38-13) shortly before halftime. The lead for the home squad swelled to as many as 33 points midway through the
second half and it was never less than 20 at any juncture in the final 20 minutes. Davidson was held
to 33.3 percent shooting (21-for-63) and committed 25 turnovers in the loss. Meanwhile, the Lady Mocs shot 50 percent for
the game (28-for-56).

The Wildcats were led by junior Robyn Flewelling and senior Bethany Schott with 13 points each while junior Lindsay Shade
chipped in with 10. Schott nearly had a double-double with nine rebounds. Warfield finished with 15 points to lead all
scorers, and, amazingly, was the only Chattanooga player in double figures. Twelve of the 13 Lady Mocs scored in the
victory including Tiffani Roberson and Katie Galloway who both netted eight.

Davidson returns to Belk Arena for its final home game and senior day to face ETSU in a crucial conference
game this Saturday, Feb. 22. Game time is slated for 3 p.m.

Davidson 82 Wofford 52

In the first game of the basketball doubleheader on Saturday afternoon, the Davidson women stormed back from a disappointing loss
to Appalachian State last week to crush conference rival Wofford University by thirty points, 82-52. Not wasting any time, Ashley
Hallsted ’04 grabbed the tip and drove straight down the middle of Wofford’s zone defense to give the ’Cats the
first two points of the game. Unfortunately, Courtney Laird ’04 picked up two quick fouls and had to be replaced
at the 18:45 mark by Katie Delk ’06. Delk’s impact was felt immediately as she put the Wildcats up 9-4
with a turnaround jumper and forced a traveling call at the other end with 17 minutes to go.

Davidson continued to force Terrier turnovers as they switched to a trapping man-to-man defense. A three-pointer by Emily Callahan ’05
at the 15:55 mark, followed by her steal and layup a minute later, put the ’Cats up 18-10. While Wofford
remained in a five-minute scoring drought, the ’Cats continued to deliver with the help of Callahan and the Davidson bench,
which accounted for 32 of their total points. The barrage of Lindsay Shade ’04 and Callahan’s three-pointers elicited a Terrier
timeout with 6:45 left in the half and put the ’Cats up 22, 37-15. The unbelievable 56 percent three-point shooting
didn’t stop in the final five minutes, as Laird added her own basket from behind the arc with 2:30 to
go. The team entered the locker room up 49-28, the 21-point advantage in large part due to Callahan’s 21 first-half
points.

Knowing that they had a lot of ground to cover, the Terriers sprang out of the locker room with the
first points of the second half, and they appeared to have stepped up their defense until Hallsted unloaded a three-pointer
at the 17:45 mark for Davidson’s first points of the second half. Wofford’s poor shooting and inability to stop the
three continued for the rest of the half, as Davidson shot 50 percent from behind the arc compared to Wofford’s
dismal 19 percent. With 5:57 to go in the game, Amanda Horne ’06 scored to put all eleven Wildcat players
on the scoreboard. A minute later, her impressive one-handed pass in transition to fellow freshman Delk for a layup put
the ’Cats up 77-47. On the very next play, Delk sent a Terrier player to the ground with a big-time
block, sending the message to Wofford that Davidson was tired of losing. As Callahan said, “We were all very focused,
and we wanted redemption from the loss to App State.” The ’Cats indeed got redemption, as they shot an impressive
51 percent from the floor and recorded their second-highest point total of the season.

Meghan Bryant ’04 believes it was a team victory. “Everyone stepped up in this game, especially Joy (Newsome ’05) and
Katie,” she said. Callahan led all scorers with 26 points. As head coach Antal Watts remarked, “Hopefully this will propel
us to do good things in our final four games.”
