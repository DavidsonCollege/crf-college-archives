8 THE DAVIDSONIAN, NOVEMBER 5, 1925

Next Friday the freshmen go to Greenville, S. C., where the Furman freshmen are to be met. Last year the
Wildkittens were smothered until the driving attack of many of the men who are on the Furman varsity today, 25
to 7, and according to reports that have been drifting out, the little Hurricane is just as strong as it
was last year, if not stronger.

It costs but seven dollars a month to go to school in China, tuition, books, board, and room included. Of
this, books constitute the largest item of expense.—The Flat Hat.

NORRIS PRIZE (Continued from page 1)

5. Each regularly enrolled student of the college may vote for the candidate of his choice in the primary by
writing the said candidate’s name on the ballot prepared for that purpose and depositing same in the ballot box; but
after the field of candidates has been narrowed down to three by the primary, only the three men receiving the
highest number of votes shall be considered in the final election.

6. Ballots for the final election shall carry the names of each of the three candidates, and the voter shall
indicate his choice by a cross-mark (X) after the name of the candidate for whom he elects to vote.

7. Balloting in both the primary and the final election shall be conducted by representatives of the Norris Athletic Trophy
Committee. Immediately after the primary, the committee shall determine from a count the three candidates to enter the final election.
Their names shall be published in the student’s newspaper, “The Davidsonian,” and also be posted on all college bulletin boards.

8. If the three men receiving the highest number of votes in the primary are below the scholarship standard adopted,
the committee may substitute the names of the next highest men whose scholastic work meets the requirements. In determining the
scholastic standing of a student, the committee shall be guided by the records on file in the registrar’s office.

9. All expenses incurred in holding both the primary and the final election, such as the cost of printing the
ballots, etc., shall be borne by the Davidson College Athletic Association.

10. The name of the winner of the trophy shall be given to the commencement program committee to be printed
in the commencement program and the trophy shall be awarded along with other awards, medals, etc., at the commencement. As
stated in the rules, this trophy shall be awarded to the man receiving the highest number of votes in the
balloting. This then becomes the property of the man so honored, to cherish and keep as long as he lives.
The rules committee will have to decide whether a man once receiving this high honor shall be eligible to compete
for it again.

The trophy is on display in the window of the White Drug Company, where it is viewed by the student
body daily. This trophy is given through the generosity of Norris, Inc., of Atlanta, the famous candy manufacturers, through Mr.
Frank E. Lowenstein. The trophy is a highly valued one, and in itself speaks of the high quality of the
Norris candies, from whence it came. The students of Davidson appreciate the generosity of the donors, and the sweetness of
Norris candies only exceeds the high regard the students have for the generosity of the manufacturers of such candies.

WILDKITTEN GRID TEAM (Continued from page 1)
and aided by a pass to Kell for 18 yards and a pass to Myers for 15 yards, put the
ball on Duke's six-yard line. Kell gained four and a half yards, Black gained one, six inches to go for
goal. On the next play Black failed to gain and the quarter ended. On the opening play of the fourth
period a delayed buck was called for, and after the two lines had become one mass, Kell gave a flying
leap, skimmed both lines and landed over for a touchdown. Wenberg failed on extra point. Other features of the last
quarter were a couple of completed passes by Duke for 24 and 18 yards each. Duke fumbled again and Davidson
recovered. Duke intercepted a Davidson pass on her own 10-yard line, and in the closing minutes McConnell and Kerr both
intercepted passes for Davidson. The backfield star for the little Wildcats was Kell, both on defense and offense, with Black
a stellar force on defense. Leftwich won first honors in the line, breaking through consistently, accompanied oftentimes by both LeFevre
and Smith. The entire team was fighting better than at any time this season.
