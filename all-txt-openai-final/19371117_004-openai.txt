these insists that on several plays Bill Johnston, back, blinded by smearing mud, groped around absolutely and hasn't gotten all
of it out of his eyes yet. On one play the ‘Cat line blocked a Harvard kick; the ball came
straight up, came down in a young lake, and bounced about a foot in the air! However, an extra strong
gust came along right then and blew it fifty yards clear over the Davidson goal. All who believe that! The
best story Felix has heard yet, and which, strangely enough, seems authentic, runs like this: Throughout the game Frank Purdy
snapped the ball to the backs very softly. After it was all over Coach asked, “Frank, why didn't you put
a little more zip on that ball?” “Well, Coach, I tell you,” drawled Frank, “that thing was pretty wet and
I couldn't handle it very well, so I just threw it up in the air and let the wind take
it on back there.” The Dukes proved themselves true gentlemen and sportsmen. The only referee available was a Davidson man,
and yet they didn’t make a single “kick” about the officiating even when close decisions went against them—an example which
the Davidson cheering section would do well to follow, especially at basketball games. Students To Guilford (Continued from Page 1)

a great line.

First Score

Virginia Military Institute’s Flying Squadron came midway of the second quarter after the ‘Cats’ stubborn defense prevented the Harvard attack
from getting a first down throughout the first period and a half of the muddy battle. On an attempted quick
kick, the slippery ball slid off the side of Williams’ foot and skidded crazily to the Wildcats’ 35. At this
point, the Harvard attack clicked for the first and only time of the dreary game.

In the inter-Virginia clashes, Washington and Lee eked out a 14-12 victory over a fighting William and Mary team. The
University of Richmond proved too powerful for Hampden-Sydney and won 19-0. Two intersectional contests saw Davidson and N. C. State
bow to powerful Northern rivals by 15-0 scores, in two of the worst rain and wind storms that have ever
been given lightest chance to football games. Harvard’s powerful Crimson, rated as one of the outstanding teams in the East,
had to use all of its resources to conquer the injury-jinxed Wildcats.

Wake Forest’s Demon Deacons had little trouble bowling over Wofford, 25-0, a Friday afternoon game. Washington and Lee, last year’s
runner-up, had little trouble in rolling over Davidson.

Last week the Sophomores nosed out the Seniors to win the first badminton championship of Davidson College. The Sophs did
not lose a match during the whole tournament, while the Seniors lost two and won four. The Juniors were third
with two wins and four losses, and the Freshmen again took last with no wins.

Badminton has proved to be quite popular this year. The weather was very favorable, and the Duke team, who narrowly
lost to West Point, should end their cross-country season in the runner-up position. The Nittens used a five-man line for
the first time in this game and it was very successful. Snelling and Johnston backed it up well. The frosh
play the Wofford College Freshmen next Saturday at Wofford.
