To be honest, The Davidsonian staff simply could not think of any more space fillers so we just decided we might as well give away the secret that that is what this is here--a space filler.

Poetry...

B.J. Rudell

Twenty-one

21
So much fun

Looking back on ages young
When dreams outweighed

The fear of truth

Enchantment came

From Dr. Seuss

And all the wonder

That you shared

With all the mischief

That you dared

Curfews, dances

Brief romances

Free to always take your chances

Mother’s squeeze

Scraped up knees

Joys of irresponsibilities
You could fly to the moon!

(If you only had permission)
You would clean up your room!
(If you’d only been a magician)
21 should not ignore

The time since you could crawl
Childhood is not the past

But a place that lives inside us all

Resisting Refrain

The music plays on

Without its players

For a silhouette
Without a partner

Who can see him weeping?

Surely not the walls
which feel every vibration
of delivering melodies
and quivering bones

Nor the lady
who once proudly paraded
on the smooth tiled floor
with sensuous steps

Who can find the lady?

Surely not the gentleman
whose eyes are cloaked
by the raging torment
of discordant rejection

Nor the walls
which merely peer inward
at the floor soaking
beneath the deserted dancer

The music will change
For all of us

For all of time

In this we trust

The floor may fade
After each dance
To signal for

A new romance

But all that we can surely do
Is turn and twist and burn and shake

To show the walls we love the song

And all the music that we make
