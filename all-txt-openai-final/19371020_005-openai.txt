Varsity Debate Try-Outs To Be Held

Debate Question Will Be Concerning Control of Labor Disputes

Varsity debating try-outs will be held on Wednesday and Thursday, Nov. 17th and 18th, it was announced recently by Bill
Kiesewetter, President of the Forensic Council for 1937-38. The debate question this year is “Resolved: That the National Labor Relations
Board Should Be Empowered to Enforce Arbitration of All Industrial Disputes.” Material for the subject is being collected by Professor
Chalmers G. Davidson, librarian, and John Reisner, secretary of the council. It will be found the latter part of the
week in the back room on the second floor of the library. Kiesewetter further stated that the customary northern, southern,
and western debating trips are being planned at this time.

Heywood Hill is the only member of last year’s varsity debating team who is back this year. The other members
were John D. Allen, Charles Mauze, Tyler Port, Robert Stewart, and Harold Sugg, members of the 1937 graduating class. The
three alternates of last year’s team are back this year, namely: Bill Kiesewetter, John Reisner, and Sherrard Rice. The subject
for last year’s debating team was: “Resolved: That Congress Should Be Empowered To Fix Minimum Wages and Maximum Hours For
Industry.” Try-outs for freshman debating will be held later on this fall, and it is hoped that they too will
have a regular debate schedule this year. Their question for debate will be the same as that of the varsity.

November Business Club Hears Banker

R. E. Kerr Explains Modern Banking Effects

The newly organized Kommerce Klub met last Thursday evening in the Philanthropic Literary Hall at which time R. E. Kerr,
executive vice president of the American Trust Company of Charlotte, was guest speaker. Mr. Kerr spoke on “Modern Banking and
Its Effects on the Community in the Present Business Era.” After an interesting talk, Mr. Kerr quite willingly and very
ably answered questions proposed by the audience composed of the forty charter members of the club and the two honorary
members, J. S. O'Connor. Mr. Kerr expressed his hearty approval of the new organization, its purposes and aims, and predicted
that it would be a big success on the campus, as well as an advantageous movement for those going into
business actively. After the meeting adjourned, Mr. Kerr was detained by many of the members who wished to make his
personal acquaintance.

The next meeting of the Kommerce Klub will be on the evening of October 27th in the Phi Hall at
8 o'clock, when a man of distinguished career in the mercantile field will be the speaker. It is hoped that
the committee for programs will be able to secure Mr. David Ovens, who is manager of Ivey's Department Store in
Charlotte and also president of the American Dry Goods Association.

Tom Corbin Makes Fine Start As Prominent Plebe At West Point

Every morning when reveille sounds at historic old West Point, Tom Corbin, Centennial Senior, leaps out of his bunk and
begins the daily routine of the West Pointers. Corbin, who finished Davidson last year, passed the entrance examinations of the
institution during the spring holidays last year and entered West Point in July of last summer. During his four years
at Davidson, Corbin established an enviable record.

Your Film Report Card

By HENNY B. BAKER

(The following film ratings are based upon those of “Time,” “Movie Mirror,” “The Digest,” and local theater advertising augmented by
the columnist's own observations). The alphabetical ratings are: A—Excellent; B—Good; C—Fair; D—Poor.

“SOULS AT SEA” — Gary Cooper, George Raft, Frances Dee, and Olympe Brande. Ye Columnist was all set to give
this production an “A,” but critics of several magazines gave it “B”—so “B” it is. It is a highly dramatic
film which belongs in the same class with “Mutiny on the Bounty.”

John Mawhinney, chairman of the program committee, introduced the novel program. The debate began by two men introducing the subject.

Mint Exhibits Ingerle Group

Includes Many Landscapes of Great Smokies

The Mint Museum in Charlotte has at present an interesting and very timely group of pictures on exhibit. It includes
landscapes and works depicting the horrors of war. Included in the paintings are thirty-five portrait studies and landscapes of the
Great Smoky Mountains by Rudolph Ingerle of Vienna and Chicago. The pictures show moonlight scenes in the Great Smoky Region
and also true-to-life studies of mountaineers. Among the works shown are “Public Sale,” “Restless Clouds,” “The Silver Veil,” “October in
the Smokies,” “Patterns of the Mist,” “Moonlace,” “Moon Pageantry,” “Carolina Moon,” “Mirrored Moonlight,” “Mount Le Conte,” “Road to Gatlinburg,” “Past-Present,”
“Salt of the Earth,” and “Just a Resting.”

Ingerle was president of the Chicago Artists for two years, was first president of the North Shore Art League, and
is now a director of the Municipal Art League. He has served on art juries with Rockwell Kent, George Bellows,
Redfield, and other famous painters. His work is in the collection of the Municipal Art League, Art Institute of Friends
of American Art, Arche Club, City Collection of Chicago, Century of Progress Exposition, Eastman Memorial Foundation, and Gary collection. From
1916 through 1936, Ingerle was awarded 17 prizes and medals for his work.

Dr. C. R. Harding, of the Davidson College Faculty, referred to Mr. Ingerle as a conservative impressionist who does not
belong to the colder classic or academic schools, but who does not go into the extremes of Modern Abstractionists, Cubists,
Post-impressionists, Futurists, and the Art for Art's Sake groups. “The very fact that the scenes are laid in Western North
Carolina,” said Dr. Harding, “makes it necessarily true that subject matter hasn't yielded first place to decoration or the more
strictly formal elements such as line, area (or contour), and color.”

Doctor Talks to Freshmen

College Physician Gives Series of Lectures

Tuesday afternoon at 3 o'clock in Chambers auditorium, Dr. John W. MacConnell began his annual series of lectures to the
freshmen. Dr. MacConnell, who has recently been appointed by Governor Clyde Hoey to the office of consultant surgeon of the
State Hospital at Morganton, began his series of lectures with a talk on “The Heart and Diseases of Circulation.” He
spoke on high blood pressure, the danger of over-heating in exercise, and on phases of blood diseases. He used charts
to exhibit his points during the lecture. Dr. MacConnell also mentioned in the course of his talk that he is
continuing his blood examinations, and would like for every man in school to have one of these tests.

This was the first of six lectures to be delivered by Mr. MacConnell, which all freshmen will be required to
attend. These will take place at intervals throughout the school session. Later a series of moving pictures will be conducted
by the school physician.

Dr. Brown Talks At Sunday School Class

The College Sunday School Class was opened last Sunday by song after which Ned Iverson led the class in prayer.
Due to the fact that the secretary and treasurer elected last year was unable to return this semester, it was
deemed advisable to elect a new secretary and treasurer. Jack Ferguson was elected to fill the position for the remainder
of the year. Dr. C. K. Brown, who has been substituting for Professor Beaty during his illness, has for his
topic (Continued on Page Six)
