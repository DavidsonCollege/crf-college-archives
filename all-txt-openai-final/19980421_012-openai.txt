SAVINGS
ON NEW

SPRING
CLOTHING!

After 50 years we’ve REALLY
gone crazy, mad, & zany and
marked the price down on
new, yes new, ladies’ spring
clothing at Harold’s! Who knew
shopping could be so much
fun!! And if that’s not enough...
there'll be cheap refreshments
(they're free!!) and loud, terri-
ble music (you'll love it!!) All
this...plus a few bizarre and
insane surprises too crazy to
mention!!
