DAVIDSONIAN

The Davidsonian’s John Evans sat down with Dexter Filkins before his address last Thursday. Excerpts of the interview are below; the entire article can be found at www.thedavidsonian.com.

Jeffery Goldberg writes that you “know better than anyone how to work your way into bad places, and work your way out again.” What is it about places like Iraq and Afghanistan that attracts you?

No, I’m not attracted to the madness of those places. I’m more attracted to the bigness of it. Iraq and Afghanistan are enormous stories. If you’re lucky enough to be on the ground in the middle of one of those places, you get to see history unfold in front of you. It’s extraordinary. The human drama is like two continental plates that push up against each other. That’s why I’m there. The violence is something you have to deal with, and you have to figure out what’s going on. But it’s much more of an intellectual experience than an adrenaline rush.

But do you think of yourself as somewhat of a thrill-seeker?

I can’t lie to you, that’s part of the experience. But it’s the type of thrill. It’s not that I like being shot at and having to speed off in a car. It’s all of it bounded together. I just came from Afghanistan. Literally. I was there for two months. It’s a whole big giant country with a long history of people dying and lives at stake. It’s huge. That’s what it’s really about. Not so much that a suicide bomber blew somebody up. It’s just the process of figuring it all out. That’s what you do when you’re a reporter. You figure it out. It’s so big and so vast and it changes so quickly day to day and there are so many moving parts that intellectually it’s really something amazing. And that’s part of the thrill for me.

How important is it to you to tell the personal stories of individual people in Iraq and Afghanistan, rather than to focus always on more public, media-making news?

When you sit down to write a book, you have to ask yourself, “What kind of book am I going to write?” I could have written any number of books. Particularly in the case of Iraq, I thought that everybody already knows these arguments anyway. We went in without a plan. No WMDs. What went wrong. Blah, blah, blah... That’s not what it is. War is on the ground. It’s people dying. It’s people getting killed. That’s what history is. History is what happens to real people. It’s not these abstract ideas. I was so exhausted by the abstractions that I wanted to write something that was very, very concrete. And in that sense, I hope powerful.

In your latest article for the New York Times, you write that the civilian death toll in Afghanistan has risen nearly 40 percent in a year, from 1523 civilian casualties in 2007 to 2118 casualties in 2008, and “is the highest since the Taliban government was ousted in 2001.” To what factors would you attribute this increase?

It’s a difficult place. It’s hard to describe if you’ve never been there. It’s a very, very difficult place to try to do anything. There are no roads, there’s no electricity, there’s no running water, there are no telephones. There’s nothing. They’re basically operating in the fourth century. The Taliban side of that is easy. The Taliban is killing people because they want to kill people. So they send a suicide bomber into a crowd, or they drop a box, or whatever. They just want to make anarchy. They want to make the presence of the Americans and NATO unsustainable. In that sense, it’s pretty easy to figure out why that’s happening.You experience life in the nation’s capital. Why the Americans are killing civilians is a little more complicated. I’m not making an argument on their behalf. There are a couple of factors in this case... They very clearly have a different set of rules of engagement that other troops don’t operate under. Which is to say that the circumstances under which they’re allowed to kill people are broader than they are for other soldiers. It’s unclear what they are. But I think there is a kind of overriding problem in Afghanistan as to why these things are happening. There have never been enough troops there to try to do the things they want to do. So the result is that there is an economy of forces. When groups of American or British soldiers or whoever come under attack, what do they do? They call in an airstrike. It’s just a lot easier to call in the airstrike. They wouldn’t have to do that if they had more people on the ground or if they were in the population. But they’re not, because they just don’t have enough people.

President Obama recently deployed 17,000 new troops into Afghanistan. What do you think about the President’s strategy in that region, and do you foresee an increase or decrease in civilian casualties?

I don’t know if it will help. It’s an extremely difficult country. It’s the graveyard of empires. All you have to do there is drive down any unpaved road and you'll be reminded of that. Inevitably there will be an old, rusty, overturned Soviet tank with the hammer and sickle still on it. The Soviets tried. The British tried. Alexander the Great tried. The Indians tried. Is it going to be any different for us? I don’t know. It’s tough. It’s very difficult. I don’t know if it’s going to work.

Does your book give you a sense of closure to all those years spent covering the wars? Or do you consider the book as sort of a necessary means to organize your thoughts and experiences in preparation for any future coverage overseas?

Both. I really wasn’t anticipating going back to Afghanistan after finishing the book. I’m really kind of tired of that. It’s exhausting. But in the case of Iraq in particular, it was emotionally very wrenching. A lot of people I knew were killed. I watched a civilization implode, disintegrate. That’s not an easy thing to see. But “yes” to both of your questions. Writing is thinking. When you write about something, you try to make sense of it. It helps you to deal with all the things you saw. You can put them in the proper context and remember them very clearly. You can try to think about what they mean. That’s basically all I tried to do.
