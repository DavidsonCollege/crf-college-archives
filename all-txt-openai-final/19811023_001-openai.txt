Buying term papers

Pacific Research reaches legal settlement with Postal Service

by Tim Whalen '82

BEWARE: From now on the College can find out if you buy research papers from Pacific Research of Seattle. Over
the summer, former Davidson basketball player John Gullickson admitted that he bought a paper from Pacific Research and handed it
in as his own work last year.

Pacific Research made three policy changes on 16 September as a result of legal action brought against them by the
Postal Inspection Service. A Pacific Research spokeswoman said the first policy change is that the company agreed to release the
names of their student customers who bought papers on or after 16 September. The company will only respond to requests
from administrators and professors, and the requests must be written on official college stationery.

She said that in addition, Pacific Research agreed to include a “longer and more explicit” release stating actual penalties for
fraudulent use of our materials, in its catalogs and ads, and with each order. Seattle postal inspector John Mohr said
the penalties for misusing Pacific Research products range up to five years in jail and a $10,000 fine.

No more custom research

In the third term of the agreement, Pacific Research eliminated their “custom research” service. Pacific Research’s 1980 catalog said, “PACIFIC
RESEARCH will produce an original (custom) research study custom-tailored to your specifications. . . . Our writers are knowledgeable and
experienced in your field: we can follow any theme you'd like examined, develop whatever argument you want developed, or elaborate
on any concept.”
