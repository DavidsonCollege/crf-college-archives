A few days following the letter was a local newspaper: “If my boy was an outstanding football player I wouldn't let him go to Davidson where, under the policy of little or no subsidizing, he probably would be the lone target for opposing teams to spot and to gang up on. I wouldn't want him to carry so large a part of the burden as has Lafferty, and probably leave the school crippled and worn. Davidson owes it to Lafferty and Wingfield and Davis and such like to protect them and to offer them support — despite Joe Johnston's nauseating statement that Lafferty is crippled because of what he did to Duke and not because of what Duke did to Lafferty. DAVIDSON SUPPORTER.”

Undoubtedly, “he’s got to have some help.” But if there is another back or two who can tote the leather, they will be able to give your first-stringer some rest, since players are much more liable to serious injury when they are tired.

Tourney Is Under Way
Juniors Continue Winning Ways By Garnering Four Straight Games

The Junior class basketball team got off with a bang this week with seven games being played off and only five remaining. Fowl led the Juniors last week with 12 points to his credit.

Sophs Come Back
The Sophomores came back in the next game, however, and set a fighting pace back to the finals. Means and Sitt made life miserable for the Juniors, leading the Soph attack with 15 points between them. The Juniors were never threatened.

Davidsonian Sports Defeated By Winston ‘Y’
Lowrance, Ellis, Wilson Win For Davidson, While McFadyen Gets Default

The Winston-Salem Y. M. C. A wrestlers scored a surprising 16-14 win over the Davidson varsity grapplers in the season's opener. Winston-Salem scored victories in the 118, 135, 145, and 155-pound classes, while Davidson took the 126, 165, and 175-pound matches and won the unlimited class on a forfeit, as no man appeared to fight Howard McFadyen, captain of the team.

The match began with a victory for Winston-Salem as Cline took Walker by a fall after two minutes and five seconds of wrestling in the 118-pound class. Davidson reversed the tables in the next bout and Lowrance beat Peddycord on a referee’s decision. The 135-pound class match went to Winston-Salem as Hailey beat Craver. Winston-Salem’s Bailey was defeated by Davidson’s Ellis in the 165-pound class, which was the feature match of the afternoon. After this win, Davidson's Wilson beat Robertson on a referee's decision.

Eighteen Frosh Grapplers Show Promise

The Davidson freshman wrestling practice has started for the year with eighteen boys out. The prospects this year are much better than the past few years. Four freshmen, Bobby Williams in the 118, Ed Whisnant in the 126, Fred Lowrance in the 135, and John Donaldson in the 155, won the finals of the intra-mural tournament. In practices, Fred Lowrance, Ed Whisnant, John Donaldson, and Raymond McDaniel have looked exceptionally good. The other boys out for the team are: Joe Wilson, John W. Moore, Charlie Rouzer, Beverly Royster, Bruce Kennedy, Jim Bolin, Hank Bahansjin, Lan Latta, Bob Parker, Norris Erb, Whitney Reynolds, Ed Brown, and Bob Brandon. Manager Charlie Parker said that there were still several places on the team to be filled.

HARDING FETES (Continued from page three)

This concluded the program of the evening and the lives of the German people.

The All-America pick of the fourth annual Intercollegiate Sports Writers Association poll was released last week by Robert A. Kunkel, of the University of North Dakota. Votes from forty states were received in the poll.

Pittsburgh maintained its rank by placing three men on the first team. Fordham and Alabama each placed two, while Carolina, Colorado, Yale, and Texas A. & M. each had one man on the first team.

North Carolina's “Hammering Hank” Bershak was chosen as an end. Bill Crowell of the Fordham Rams, who placed “Handy Andy” on his first team All Fordham-Opponents club, also received honorable mention. Writers were not allowed to vote for more than one player from any one team.

The freshman basketball team has been practicing now for about two weeks, and much progress has been made in that time with the material at hand. The squad has shown a great deal of promise, and the Wildkittens will engage the Carolina frosh in Charlotte on Jan. 15th, on the same night that the varsity plays the Blue Phantoms. The Carolina freshman team is reported to be very good, and the Davidson frosh are pointing for this game.

Ned Iverson, stellar Wildcat forward, dribbles down the court. Ned is a Junior and will be seeing his second year as a first-stringer on the Davidson hardwood club. He broke into the opening line-up in his Sophomore year and started every game, being high scorer for the Cats.—(Courtesy Charlotte News).

So there are two courses for Davidson to take: either she can begin to subsidize or she can arrange easier schedules for the Wildcat teams. At first thought one might say, “Subsidize,” but Davidson's finances are much too limited to do so.. around the campus that the frosh are stronger this year than they have been in many years, and it is quite probable that there will be some unexpected upsets in the freshman loop.
