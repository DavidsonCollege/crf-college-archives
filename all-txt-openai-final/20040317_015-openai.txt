While most Davidson students poured away from campus immediately to enjoy their spring breaks, the men’s tennis team had to
wait two extra days. The team entered the final two days of February having compiled a 5-2 record against non-conference
opponents, but the real test was about to begin with a trip to Charleston to play two conference matches in
two days against The Citadel and the College of Charleston.

After suffering two unexpected losses to The Citadel last season, including a first-round loss in the Southern Conference tournament, the
Wildcats were hoping to get some revenge against the Bulldogs. Davidson never really got into the match, though, perhaps suffering
the effects of their eight-day layoff following a win over Richmond, and they lost by a 5-2 margin. The Wildcats
were plagued once again by inconsistency in the doubles matches, as only Rob Haywood ’04 and Donald Miles ’05 managed
to win, earning an 8-5 victory at the number one position. Davidson missed multiple opportunities in the other two doubles
matches, giving away the doubles point for a 1-0 advantage for The Citadel.

With two notable exceptions, the ’Cats continued to struggle in singles. Bryan Stonestreet ’04 and Porus Jetli ’07 won easily
at the three and six positions, respectively, while the rest of the team did not fare quite as well. Though
three of the other four matches stretched to three sets, the men were unable to close out the victories, giving
The Citadel the 5-2 win. While disappointed in the result, head coach Jeff Frank recognized the Wildcats’ potential against The
Citadel: “We can beat that team if we play anywhere near our potential.”

Davidson faced a tough task the next day, trying to rebound from their disappointing loss against probably the best team
in the conference, the College of Charleston Cougars. While all three doubles matches were close, on this day the Wildcats
could only muster a win at number two, courtesy of Jonathan Britt ’04 and Rob Gould ’04. While the Cougars
earned the 1-0 lead with the doubles point, Frank was encouraged that the ’Cats gave themselves opportunities to steal the
doubles point from the conference’s best team.

In the singles competition, Davidson once again managed to pull out only two victories. Britt outlasted his opponent 6-3, 5-7,
7-5 to notch a win at number four, while Jetli once again came through with an impressive three-set victory at
number six, winning 6-4, 1-6, 6-4. Despite the solid efforts from Britt and Jetli, the Wildcats lost 5-2 for the
second day in a row.

“I felt good about our performance against Charleston,” remarked Frank. “We could’ve won the doubles point and some of the
singles matches could’ve gone our way as well. I still feel that they are the best team in the conference.”

After two weeks off, the men returned to the courts last Saturday, hosting the James Madison University Dukes at the
Covington Courts. In a match that did not feature Davidson’s best tennis, the Wildcats still emerged victorious with a 6-1
win. The two-week layoff, one of which included spring break, certainly played a factor in the team’s rust, especially in
the doubles competition. Haywood and Miles won easily at number one as did Stonestreet and Russ Burns ’05 at number
three, but Britt and Gould struggled to find the form that propelled them over North Carolina’s number two team earlier
this season. Regardless, the Cats earned the doubles point for the 1-0 lead over the Dukes.Five Starters as Favorites to
Win Southern Conference Next Season

COMMENTARY By Matt Garfield Editor Emeritus

There are plenty of reasons for optimism heading into next season for the men’s basketball team. All five starters are
back, along with key bench players Ian Johnson and Kenny Grant. Richmond transfer Jason Morton joins incoming freshman Jason Richards
to provide even more depth. And the SoCon’s perennial favorites — ETSU and College of Charleston, especially — lose several
key players to graduation, clearing the way for the Wildcats to enter the 2004-05 season as favorites to win the
conference title and advance to the NCAAs.

If recent trends are any indication, Davidson may have history on its side.

Wildcat fans certainly remember their team’s trip to the 2002 NCAA Tournament and its near upset of Ohio State in
the first round. But what many may forget is that the nucleus of players on that team needed a full
year of experience in the prior season to prepare them for the title drive — the type of experience the
current nucleus gained this year. That 2000-01 season was frustrating — the team got off to a slow start, struggled
with consistency, and didn’t find its rhythm until late in the year. Sound familiar? Like that team, the Wildcats caught
fire in February and into March; their nine-game conference winning streak over the last month of the season proved they
can compete with the SoCon’s best. And like that team, they’ll enter next year with both experience and momentum.

Logan Kosmalski ’05, Nick Booker ’05, and Ian Johnson ’06 will help lead a star-studded team next season. But will
those strengths translate into a SoCon title and a return trip to the NCAAs? The one-two punch of Brendan Winters
and Logan Kosmalski will be as good as any you’ll find in the SoCon. So the key for this team
becomes surrounding that tandem with capable, consistent role players who can also shoulder some of the scoring load when necessary.
And luck always is a major factor: the 2002 team was fortunate to draw three beatable opponents in the SoCon
tournament, none as good as East Tennessee State this year.

With so many players returning, and with the conference looking a little less imposing, the Wildcats appear well positioned to
compete for a championship. Anything less will be seen by many as a disappointment.

The singles matches featured even more success for Davidson, as the Wildcats were victorious in five out of the six
matches. Haywood, the team’s top player, returned to the winner’s circle after several disappointing matches following his recent injury problems.
Despite still not playing up to his high standards, Haywood commented that “it was good to come through and get
the win and break out of my slump.” Jetli was also victorious in singles for the third straight match, easily
winning 6-1, 6-2 at number six to improve his record to a team-leading 6-3. “The guys fought hard,” observed Frank.
“They weren’t sharp at all times, but they eked out some good matches. Porus played especially well again at six.
He’s almost floating out there right now.”

The win over James Madison returned the Wildcats to their winning ways, stretching their season record to 6-4. Though the
’Cats are 0-2 so far in the conference, they have two more big conference matches this week. Davidson travels to
Elon on Thursday afternoon and hosts perennial contender Furman on Sunday at 1:30 p.m. With many tough conference matches looming
on the horizon, Frank recognizes the recipe for success: “We just need to get into a rhythm where we play
a lot more matches. We’re amazingly deep beyond the top six, and we’re finally pretty healthy.”
