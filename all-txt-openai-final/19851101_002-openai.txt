Arab relations specialist discusses terrorism

David E. Long '59, the Middle Eastern Area Officer for the Office of Counter-Terrorism in the U.S. State Department, spoke
on international terrorism at the Dean Rusk Forum on Thursday, October 24.

Long, a specialist in Arab relations, said that one of the main problems of terrorism is to define it. “One
man’s terrorist is another man’s freedom fighter,” he stated, adding that this ambiguity causes difficulty in isolating an enemy other
nations can work to counter.

Another problem, Long pointed out, is to determine who committed various terrorist acts. He said many countries will openly oppose
terrorism while secretly they support it, for terrorism is a relatively inexpensive form of violence in comparison to the amount
spent on open warfare.

One aspect of terrorism which Long has seen throughout the world is that terrorists all seem to have a sense
of hopelessness in solving the problems they face.

Long serves on the Advisory Council for the Dean Rusk Program and also helps with the Davidson in Washington Program.

Girls banned from campus in scooter incident

On Friday, October 25, Officer Ray Thrower noticed that his police scooter was missing from in front of the police
hut. He came out of the office to find that two girls had moved the scooter to the side of
the hut. The girls were apparently trying to start the vehicle.

The girls were from a school in Winston-Salem.

Thrower analyzed the situation and concluded: “There was not really any criminal intent.” He advised the girls of their rights
and issued them trespassing warnings, which state that they cannot return to the Davidson College Campus.

Thrower said the warnings are standard procedure and go on file at the police station. Should the girls return, Thrower
said that they will be issued citations.

Wisconsin-born musician John McCutcheon will perform in the 900 Room on Nov. 5 at 7:30 p.m. This folk singer plays
banjo, guitar, autoharp, fiddle, and hammer dulcimer, for which he is especially well-known.
