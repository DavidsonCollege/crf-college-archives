JUNIORS WILL GIVE DANCES

Annual Junior Speaking Weekend Will Be Held March 13 and 14

After a month's rest from the Mid-Winter dances, the junior class again turns the Davidson student’s mind to dancing with the announcement of Junior Speaking to be held the thirteenth and fourteenth of March. Nine representatives of the respective fraternities have assumed the responsibility of giving satisfaction to the habituated hoof hoppers, announces Russell Patterson, president of the class. These men are: Dave Sellars, Beta Theta Pi; Ken Knorr, J. C. Crowell, Pi Kappa Alpha; Joe Hunter, Kappa Alpha; Ed Armfield, Pi Kappa Phi; Carl Carlson, Sigma Alpha Epsilon; Russell Patterson, Kappa Sigma; Jack Branch, Phi Gamma Delta; and Jim Morton, Sigma Phi Epsilon.

The set will consist of three dances which include the Friday night formal, the Saturday afternoon tea dance, and the Saturday night informal. All three of these dances will be held in the Charlotte Armory-Auditorium. Further plans will be made at a meeting to be held Tuesday night. The sponsors will be announced in the near future.

The origin of Junior Speaking weekend goes back into the moss-drippings past far beyond the range of mere human memory. Junior Speaking was once the time of year when each member of the Junior class delivered an oration, then a requirement for graduation. A companion to this event was “Senior Speaking,” a preceding day when all seniors delivered their speeches. A social feature has been con- (Continued on Page 6)

ANNUAL MEETING OF BOARD OF TRUSTEES IS HELD HERE TODAY

PETITION FOR DANCES IS SUBMITTED TODAY

Another petition for dancing on the Davidson College campus was presented to the trustees for their consideration at their annual meeting Wednesday, February 19. The petition reads as follows:

To the Board of Trustees:

In view of the fact that the dances given by Davidson students this year have been conducted in a most respectable and decorous manner, which fact we consider proof that Davidson dances CAN be so conducted regardless of the place where they take place; we respectfully request that the board consider allowing dances to be presented on the campus at the earliest time which it deems possible.

Respectfully submitted,
The Davidson College

F. L. JACKSON STATES FACTS ON OPERATION OF BOOK STORE

Profits From Sale of Books Aid Students Through Loan Fund

When interviewed on a criticism voiced in an editorial a few weeks ago with regard to longer and more convenient hours for the bookstore to be open, Mr. F. L. Jackson, treasurer of the College, made the following reply:

The Business Office of the College is run solely as a service unit of the institution. Its one purpose for existence is to serve and make more effective the other divisions of the College work. The bookstore is operated for the convenience of the students. It is operated without cost to the bookstore or profit to the college. If too many books are not left on our hands, a small profit is made. Such profit, if made, has for a quarter of a century gone into the student loan fund. Several hundred boys have been helped through college in this manner.

We might keep the store open all day, or any part of the day the students might like. This would necessitate adding to the cost of the textbooks. The College Business Officer’s Association, however, feels that the textbooks are already too high and is doing everything possible in a cooperative way to get the prices reduced. It would be possible also to employ clerks to keep the store open for longer periods, but this would either add to the cost of the books, or necessitate adding a line of eats, drinks, novelties, etc., which would be in direct competition to the student store. Suggestions for the improvement of the service of any part of the Business Office are always solicited, considered, and appreciated. If some other hour would be more convenient for a majority of the students, we would like for it to be indicated.

Pan-Hellenic Offers Plans For Dance Set

As an outcome of the success of the installment plan used for the Mid-Winter dances, the Pan-Hellenic Council is proposing a similar system for the Bowery Ball, to be held in April. The plan used for the Mid-Winter set, whereby each person planning to attend paid one dollar a month for five months, was mainly responsible for the excellent orchestra. 

The proposed plan, which has met the approval of seven of the social fraternities, is that each person is (Continued on Page 6)

Dr. W. L. Lingle and Mr. Jackson Make Report on Condition of College

TO PLAN CENTENNIAL

May Select Director of Physical Education

Trustees of Davidson convened today, Wednesday, February 19, for their annual meeting, to consider the present status of the College as manifested in the reports of President Lingle and Mr. Jackson. The executive committee, composed of ten of the forty-nine trustees, met Tuesday at 2:30, to hear the yearly reports before being read to the trustees as a whole. The president’s report consisted of, primarily, a resume of college activity and curriculum, and a list of eighteen recommendations for the committee’s and eventually the trustees’ approval. Mr. Jackson's report, although not a yearly report, as was the president's, dealt with the present financial condition of the College.

The committee appointed last year to consider the question of dancing on the campus met again Tuesday evening to consider the petition and this year's “reminder” petition which was drawn up and submitted to the group. Aside from the many other small committee meetings, the main subject of consideration was the yearly report drawn up and presented by President Walter Lingle. The first division of this paper consisted of concise discussions of the major phases of college activities and their present status. The students were first dealt with as to number and classification. Following this, a brief paragraph was devoted to the faculty, those on leave, and those teaching at present. The curriculum and its problems followed logically in the discussion. The next three topics were given over to the Otts lecture, Vesper services, and the lecture series for ministers being sponsored by the College. Then, in the realm of extra-curricular (Continued on Page 2)

AN EDITORIAL

MERITS OF FRESHMAN FRANCHISE...

In recent issues of The Davidsonian, there have been opinions expressed concerning the question of Freshman voting. There can be no doubt that the question is one which warrants the earnest consideration of every member of the student body. To the man who is seriously and sincerely interested in the general well-being of Davidson, there is nothing of more importance than the revision of some of our freshman rules and regulations, particularly the question of freshman voting. Let us consider the situation since the entry of the present senior class. The measure prohibiting freshman voting was passed during the spring term of 1933, the class of 1936 being the last freshman class allowed to vote. The vote was taken away on the grounds that freshmen were the most easily influenced members of the student body, and that they knew the nominees less than any other members. The first point is difficult to gainsay, though it seems as if a mountain were made out of a molehill in regard to it. The second point can not only be questioned, but actually refuted. We of the upper classes are prone to consider that the freshmen do not know us, simply because we do not know them. If we are able to go back, in memory, to our freshman year, we will find that we knew far more upperclassmen than we might at first think. It is an established fact that one knows the classes ahead of him quite well in a school like Davidson, and the classes behind him to a much smaller degree. Thus the situation as we1906 and went on to study at Oxford, Union Theological Seminary, and Hampden-Sydney College. In 1914 he was ordained into the ministry and served from 1914 to 1917 as a home missionary in Wake County, N.C. With America’s entrance into the World War, Mr. Lacy became a chaplain and later captain with the Field Artillery in a division of the U.S. Army. After the armistice, he was called to the pastorate of the Central Presbyterian Church in Atlanta, where he served for seven years. Since 1926, Dr. Lacy has served as president of the Union Theological Seminary, Hampden-Sydney College.

NO EPIDEMIC

The following announcement was made Monday by John W. MacConnell, M.D., the college physician: “Influenza seems to be on the wane. At Davidson, we have not had the fullest force of the epidemic, though we have had over 50 cases last week and there are 10 cases in the infirmary today, none very serious and all uncomplicated.”

(Continued on Page 2)

...now have it, deprives some of our most competent voters of their franchise, and allows many to retain their franchise who have less right to it than the man who faces three more years in college. For the relieving of the situation alluded to above, a plan has been worked out which entitles each freshman to a half-vote. Thus, one upperclassman vote would equal two freshman votes. This feature would eliminate practically all danger of the politically skillful working havoc with the elections through influencing freshman votes. The plan would provide that each freshman ballot be so marked when printed, so that there could be no possibility that freshman votes would count more than their prescribed value. In this manner, the freshman class would be re-incorporated into the student body. It is unjust, and in a sense, unconstitutional to segregate any class, as the freshman class is now segregated. It might be added that since the placing of this additional restriction on the freshman class, the classes have been more inclined to disregard or disobey present regulations, and various demonstrations of so-called “class spirit” have been far more obvious than formerly. This measure is designed to affect the class of 1940, and not the present freshman class. No doubt, the suggestions the proposed plan introduces are most welcome. Comments and suggestions on the plan will be most welcome. In final analysis, the evils it introduces are insignificant compared to the evils brought about by the present voting situation. Every member of the student body should not fail to give the plan his full consideration. —Carleton B. Chapman.

WILL SPEAK HERE

Pictured above is the Reverend H. B. Johnson of Winston-Salem who will speak here on February 24.

REV. H. JOHNSON WILL LECTURE ON COUNTRIES OF SCANDINAVIA

Winston-Salem Minister To Speak in Chambers on Feb. 24th

Reverend Herbert Johnson, minister of Fries Memorial Moravian Church of Winston-Salem, will lecture in Chambers Auditorium, Monday night, the 24th, on the Scandinavian countries.

Mr. Johnson came to Wisconsin from his native Swedish home. Of course, he will deal with all the Scandinavian countries, but his lecture will be particularly interesting and popular because of the Scandinavian angle. Mr. Herbert Johnson will be accompanied by Mrs. Johnson, who will take part in the popular program feature with piano selections; the Norwegian National Anthem, one of the very famous Scandinavian folk songs, and a Norwegian hymn. The lecture has already been delivered in several colleges over the country. It will be a non-technical lecture which will appeal to students of history and music and to the public in general. Mr. Johnson’s son, Thor Martin Johnson, an acquaintance of Davidson’s Director of Music, James Christian Pfohl, now conducts the famous Little Symphony Orchestra at Mr. Pfohl’s Alma Mater, the University of Michigan. The Little Symphony Orchestra appeared here last year and will appear again on March 6, under the direction of Mr. Herbert Johnson. Mr. Johnson’s parents came to this country while he was still a youth. Mr. Johnson received his early education in this country. He graduated from the Moravian College in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and has been in the service of the Moravian church for the past fifteen years.

Varsity Men Debate Washington & Lee

The Davidson debaters met their first opponents of the season, Washington and Lee University, here last Tuesday night. The decision was given out too late to be included in this week's edition of the paper. Wade Boggs and Tyler Port represented Davidson in this first home debate, held in the “Eu” hall at 7:15 last night. The question was “Resolved: That Congress should be permitted to override with a two-thirds majority vote any 5 to 4 decisions of the Supreme Court declaring a law of Congress unconstitutional.”
