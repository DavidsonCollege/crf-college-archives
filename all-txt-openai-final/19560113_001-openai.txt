**LISTED (Page 3) SENIOR SCHOLARSHIPS**

DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N. C., FRIDAY, JANUARY 13, 1956

The National Intercollegiate Bridge Tournament on February 23 will climax an active second semester for the Davidson Bridge Club. Regular
meetings are planned for January 26 and February 14. In the tournament, sixteen players from Davidson will compete with the
nation’s best undergraduate bridge players by playing duplicate Contract Bridge under uniform regulations. Winning teams and individual champions will receive
recognition for campus, regional, and national level competition.

During the first semester, the club held a campus-wide tournament won by Mrs. S. R. Spencer and Dan Lafar and
sponsored an exhibition game featuring a bridge expert. On January 10, each of the fifty bridge club members brought a
guest to the meeting in an effort to interest students and townspeople in duplicate bridge and to increase the membership
of the club. The club was formed last year with Mr. J. C. Postell, of Charlotte, as director. About twenty-five
students and the same number of townspeople are members of the club, and any bridge player is welcome to play
as a guest.

Results of the duplicate tournament held in the College Union on January 10 are as follows: North-South: First, Dr. and
Mrs. Spencer; second, Rush Wilson and Warren McCall; third, Joe Brown and Andy Watson; fourth, Bill Tedford and J. M.
Tait. East-West: First, Dr. and Mrs. Workman; second, Larry Champion and S. D. Maloney; third, Dr. and Mrs. McGavock; fourth,
Dan LaFar, and Huger King. There were ten tables participating.

Just before the Christmas holidays, on Tuesday, December 13, 1955, Mr. R. D. Hall of Belmont, N. C., was the
guest of the Davidson College ROTC Cadet Regiment. The visit was of particular significance because Mr. Hall was the first
student commander of the Davidson College military unit, commanding a battalion of the ROTC in 1918-1919. Mr. Hall, who graduated
in 1919 from Davidson, and who was active in class athletics, publications, and oratory, said, “I was delighted at the
wonderful exhibition by the cadet corps, and tremendously impressed by the cadet briefing and the departmental facilities. There has been
an unbelievable change over the beginning of the corps; and it was a tremendous thrill to me in coming back.
My only hope is that none of these cadets will have to use the skill they have learned in the
ROTC.” He concluded that, “It was truly great to see this part of the national defense in such competent hands.”

Mr. Hall's itinerary included a briefing by the Regimental Staff, a conference with senior Cadet Commanders and the Regimental Staff,
a tour of the ROTC facilities, and an observation of the Cadet Corps during their Tuesday afternoon inspection and drill.
The ROTC was fortunate to receive from Mr. Hall several clippings from issues of the Davidsonian of several generations ago
telling of the work of the ROTC. These clippings were posted on the bulletin board in the ROTC.

Fred G. Myers, a senior here at Davidson, has become the school’s eleventh Rhodes Scholar. He is one of 32
students representing 30 states and 23 colleges who will enter Oxford University, England, next fall for at least two years
of study in the fields of their choice. Myers plans to read for the Honour School of English Language and
Literature, one of the 26 colleges which make up the University. Myers and the 31 other winners were selected in
a process which takes place in three stages. First, they were designated by the president or other responsible official of
their colleges to participate in the competition. They were then chosen by a State Committee of Selection to go forward
as one of the state’s two nominees to appear before a District Committee comprising six states. Finally, they were named
by the District Committee to receive one of the four Rhodes Scholarships allotted to each of the eight districts in
this country.

When the Rhodes Scholarships were founded in 1903, under the provisions of the will of Cecil Rhodes, this award constituted
a pioneer effort in the field of international educational exchange. Winning Rhodes scholarships has become almost routine at Davidson College.
There may be another small liberal arts college that has won as many scholarships as Davidson, but if so it
has not been well advertised. This year for the eleventh time a Davidson student has won this coveted award and
proved again that this college deserves its reputation for having one of the highest scholastic standards in the country. Davidson
wins scholarships where other colleges win football games. —Charlotte Observer

Three social fraternities have elected new slates of officers at their last meetings. These three fraternities are Pi Kappa Phi,
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and Sigma Chi. Williamson is the new president of the Pi Kapps. Bill Duke holds the position
of secretary, David McFadyen is the new treasurer, Al Moreau the boarding house manager, and Joe Huskins will serve as
IFC representative. The SAEs are now headed by Dee Helm who is serving as president. Charles T. Henry is vice
president, Ralph Brigman is secretary, and Jack Williamson is treasurer. Boyce Martin is now boarding house manager, Jimmy Conger is
corresponding secretary, and Ross Smyth is serving as rush chairman. As president of Sigma Chi, Charlie Robinson heads the list
of new officers for the coming semester. John Trotti has been elected vice president and Jim Kuist is now serving
as secretary.

The Davidson College Gift Fund Drive begins on February 1 and lasts through March 1. This year the Gift Fund
Committee has a two-fold aim: First, to educate the student body in the two fields which have been chosen for
us to invest our money and second, to encourage students to contribute. There were two projects selected: a foreign and
a local project. The foreign project is the buying of receivers for an educational station in the southern Philippine Islands.
Each of these receivers will serve about 20 people. This station is sponsored by several denominations and is designed to
fulfill three functions: to educate people in child care, home economics, and agriculture; to spread the voice of Christianity in
this area; to make people aware of the threat of Communism. The local project for this year is concerned with
Mental Health. Our money will be used by the Alexander County Mental Health Association to help build a new mental
health clinic.

Frank Sherrill, organist, will give a recital on Friday evening, January 20, in the Davidson College Presbyterian Church in Davidson.

Come,” and the Toccata, Adagio and Fugue in C Major by Bach; Schumann’s “Canon in B Minor”; the “Chorale No.
2”; two movements from Messiaen’s “La Nativite,” and the “Grand Choeur Dialogue” by Gigout.as secretary. The treasurer for the coming
semester is Jim Kiser, the boarding house manager, and France Jordan, corresponding secretary, Willie Thompson, and editor, Rogers Bates.

At its first meeting of the new year, the Student Council last Monday night heard and acted on the report
given by the curriculum committee. The committee, with Dan LaFar as chairman and Bill Bondurant and Pat Woodward as members,
has recently been working on suggested changes to the college curriculum.

There will be a voluntary dance to be held on Friday, February 17, (2) The concert to be held on
the afternoon of the eighteenth, and (3) The informal STATE OF THE COLLEGE (Page 2) NO. 12.

Woody Herman and His Third Herd will play at Davidson's Annual Midwinters Function to be held on the weekend of
February seventeenth and eighteenth. Herman has just returned from a tour on the Pacific Coast where he was acclaimed to
be a success. The Third Herd features some of America’s top musical artists such as Dick Collins, Bill Castigino, and
Al Porcino.

The students and their “Southern Belles” will be able to hear musical presentations by the “Ole Woodehopper” three times during
the dance weekend: (1) The formal dance to be held at 8:00 that night. Herman's popularity began almost immediately after
he recorded his first musical arrangement. His latest Capitol releases are “Muskrat Ramble,” “Woodehopper’s Mambo,” and the “Mexican Hat Trick.”
He has proved himself to be a very capable musician by doubling on the clarinet and the alto saxophone and
singing novelty and ballad numbers. During his tour in Europe in 1954, he proved himself popular with Europeans who said
that this was the first time that they had heard a truly great American band. His tour ranged in an
area from Oslo to Munich. As a result of his tours and appearances, the Third Herd has been chosen by
the Metronome Poll, Parade, and Time as the band which has done more for bringing back dancing than any other
band. He will be coming directly from successful engagements at the Blue Note in Chicago, the Paladium Ballroom in Hollywood,
and the Basin Street in New York to play at Davidson's Midwinters Function weekend.

GETS $411,400 GIFT (Continued on Page Six)

Chapel service in Lingle Chapel of the Davidson College will be led by students and faculty members. All members of
the student body, faculty, and administration are invited to attend.

The Council did, however, pass by a unanimous vote “to request the Faculty Curriculum Committee to present the reasons for
the inclusion of each of the subjects required for graduation.” Councilman Jason McManus suggested that, perhaps the Council should pool
its resources and consult with the faculty to present a more unified front. This suggestion received favorable consent from other
Council members; however, no action was taken.

The report by Chairman LaFar included certain required courses and the suggestion that a student be placed on the faculty
curriculum committee. A motion to this effect was delayed until the next scheduled meeting which will be held on December
12. Davidson College was named one of the beneficiaries in the Ford Foundation’s $260 million grant to privately supported colleges.

This is the largest single gift in philanthropic history, and Davidson’s sum of $411,400 was the third largest in the
state of North Carolina. For example, Davidson College’s handsome sum of $411,400 will produce only about $17,000 annually for the
10 years it must be invested in endowment. This income will increase salaries of the 63 faculty members only about
$270 each per year.

"... a remarkable and fluent technique and the soul of a true poet.” Thus one writer has characterized the brilliant
pianist David Bar-Ilan. Mr. Bar-Ilan appears tonight on the Chambers Auditorium stage at 8:15 as the new year’s first Artist
Series performance.

Born in Haifa, Israel, Bar-Ilan commenced the study of piano when he was five years old, and gave his first
public recital at the age of ten. As a child, he was also a brilliant mathematician, which prodigious talent led
him to a degree, by correspondence, from the University of London when he was 17. However, his mathematics teacher heard
him play the piano and urged him to study for the concert stage. At fourteen, he had joined the Hagana,
the Israeli underground, and three years later was fighting in the Israeli War for Israel's independence. He took part in
the battle to clear Galilee and in the Battle of Nazareth.

Following the war, Bar-Ilan began formal training at the Guildhall School of Music and the Mannes College of Music in
New York. There he studied under the eminent pianist Hans Neumann. Since his formal training, he has become one of
the most successful concert artists in the world. During the coronation of Elizabeth II, he became the first non-Commonwealth citizen
to win the medal given annually by Dame Harriet Cohen, pianist to the Queen of England. This medal is awarded
by the British Music League to the year’s outstanding young pianist.

DAVID BAR-ILAN

Bar-Ilan has since been heard in concert throughout the United States and Europe. He gave the first concert ever presented
in the ancient city of Nazareth. Critics have acclaimed his “whirlwind technique, tremendous sound, and undoubted musicianship and brilliance.” For
his concert here at Davidson, he has chosen the following: Bach's Toccata and Fugue in E Minor; Beethoven Sonata in
C, Opus 53; Chopin Ballade in F Minor, Opus 52; Ben-Haim: Intermezzo, Opus 118, No. 2 and Ballade, Opus 118,
No. 4 by Brahms; and Hungarian Rhapsody No. 15 by Liszt.

The Council also discussed a proposal to require an additional endowment of $470,000. Also, the grant will build no buildings,
buy no laboratory equipment or books while it is in endowment for the required 10 years. It will provide only
an insufficient increase in teacher salaries.
