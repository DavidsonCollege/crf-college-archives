Basketeers Close Out Campaign With One-Sided Win Over Cadets!
By C.D. STRIBLING

The Wildcats brought their 1950 basketball season to a successful conclusion last Saturday night with an overpowering revenge victory over
The Citadel. The Cats had been beaten by this same team in Charleston by a score of 41-34 in the
“poorest game of the season” for the hot and cold hoopsters according to Coach Boyd Baird. The score this time
was 87-48 and the Cats amply fulfilled Captain Whit Cobb's chapel prediction that they would “beat the pants off The
Citadel.”

Whit Cobb was the whole story as he closed out a brilliant cage career with his most prolific scoring spree,
ending up with a total of 22 points. This topped his previous 20-point effort in the Clemson game. So, in
a storybook ending, Mr. Cobb finished off four years of varsity basketball in a blaze of glory. He had ample
support for the night from Tommy Haller with 14, Fred Hengeveld with 11, and long Bill Brooks with 8 points.
The cagers were hot as firecrackers in the last game of a season that has been characterized by on and
off nights. The Kaydets tried to make a game of it but were impotent at their best against the fast-breaking
Cats.

The final record for Davidson was 10 won and 16 lost. Bill Brooks stood out in the scoring totals with
290 points for an 11.1 average. Haller followed with 242 points and a 9.3 average. The game average for the
squad was 58.7 while the opponents averaged 62.9. All indications point to a great season ahead for the young and
scrapping Wildcats.

Coach Charlie Parker and Mott Price may well be discussing the latter’s chances in the Conference Tourney at College Park,
Md., next week. Mott will wrestle in the 175-pound class for the Cat grapplers.

Brooks, Haller, Cobb Post Individual Records During Season
By WOODY McKAY

Bill Brooks, Davidson’s sophomore scoring ace, closed out his first season as a varsity player by topping the scoring list
of the Wildcat basketballers. Starting out as a chief firebug for basketball nets of the Wildcats, Brooks whipped in goal
after goal to make himself a marked man to all opponents. Then competing teams learned his favorite shots and tried
to hold down his basket-burning techniques, but Bill still hit the hoops consistently to remain among the conference leaders throughout
the season. Three times he endorsed his membership in the Charlotte Observer’s “Twenty Club,” and sizzled in thirty points against
the Hanes Hosiery semi-pro quintet. All in all, it appears as if Brooks will continue to be a feared man
by Southern Conference mentors for his remaining two years of college basketball.

A junior, with only a smattering of varsity experience under his belt before the ‘49-'50 season, ended in second place
on Davidson's scoring charts. Tommy Haller has proved himself to be a real ball hawk as well as a scorer
this season, and has been a great asset to the team. His floor play steadily improved through the season, and
he was faking foul shots as well as opponents as the season closed.

Greek Tournament Produces Surprises
By JIM SMITH and J. V. HOWELL

Phi Delts 33; Phi Gams 29
The Phi Delts took a close 33-29 decision from the Phi Gams in a first-round game of the Inter-Fraternity Basketball
Tournament Wednesday night. The score was tied 15-all at halftime, but the Phi Delts forged ahead to win. Lambeth and
Spires led the Phi Delt scoring with 11 and 10 points respectively, while Whiteman was tops for the Phi Gams
with 11 points.

K.A.'s 42; Pikas 38
The KA’s, led by Pryor who scored 14 points, knocked a favored Pika team out of the main round of
the Intra-Fraternity Basketball Tournament last Wednesday night. The score was nip and tuck throughout the game, with the KA’s finally
ending up on top. Jim Smith scored 14 points to lead the Pikas.

Sigma Chi 44; Campus Club 21
The Sigma Chi's won an easy game from the Campus Club, 44-21, to put them into the quarter-finals of the
Intra-Fraternity Basketball Tournament. The Sigma Chi’s were never threatened. They held a 17-9 halftime lead and coasted to victory. Berry
led the Sigma Chi's with 12 points, while Remson was high for the Campus Club with six points.

Phi Delts 37; SAE 35
The Phi Delts won another close game. The Phi Delts led 19-14 at halftime, but were almost overtaken by the
SAE’s before the game ended. Lambeth again led the Phi Delts, scoring 14 points, while Atkin was high man for
the SAE's with 11 points.

Kappa Sig's placed in the quarter-finals of the Intra-Fraternity Basketball Tournament. Leading 23-14 at halftime, they were never seriously threatened
by the Pi Kapps. Leading the Kappa Sig scorers was Fitzgerald with 17 points, while Cassels was high for the
Pi Kapps with nine points.

The tournament began with Pi Kappa smothering a fighting team of the Beta by 45-29. Billy Cassels led the Pi
Kapps by dumping in 10 points.

SPRING SPORTS...
(Continued From Page Four)
The best description of the promise this blackhead, hustler has shown in off-season work would be found in re-reading the
above two paragraphs, substituting White for Gregg. The two are that much alike. White is probably the faster of the
two, if not as shifty. But then, when they can’t see you they can't hit you. Together with A. C.,
he seems to be the boy who'll coordinate with speed and deceptiveness the Cat T-attack with the passing of Lambeth
and the plunging of fullback C. L. Runyan, an element sorely absent from the Davidson offense last fall. Gordon Stuart
and Wood Leach are undeniably good-lookers at half, too, but Leach is a senior and won’t be around three more
years as will Gregg and White. Stuart, however, is going to be around for three years.

One of Davidson's all-time greats is next in line in the point parade. Captain Whit Cobb finished his Wildcat basketball
career in a blaze of glory, scoring twenty-two points in his finale against The Citadel and playing as great or
greater than expectations could call for.Great team man, Whit was a constant threat all the time he was on the
basketball floor because of his sharpshooting ability from near mid-court and his agility at defensive as well as offensive play.
A type of player which Davidson will always be proud to claim, Whit will remain in the memory of Davidsonians
for years to come, along with such men as Tommy Peters and Buddy Cheek. Fred Hengeveld takes the clean-up spot
and is another man who has proved his worth in continuous varsity competition. Dutch’s long shots accounted for many points
this season and were almost impossible to stop. Dutch started practically every game and handed in a reputable record at
the season's close.

Tom Coleman is fifth in scoring honors and shows as much promise as any man on the team. He is
a hawk for rebounds and a good floor man and seems to have his finger in every play.

These boys should grow and develop with Little's T, or better said, it should grow and develop with them. Team
scoring is as follows:

| Player | Games | FG | FT | TP | Avg. |
|-------------|-------|----|----|-----|------|
| Brooks | 26 | 112| 66 | 290 | 11.1 |
| Haller | 26 | 94 | 54 | 242 | 9.3 |
| Cobb | 26 | 94 | 45 | 233 | 8.9 |
| Hengeveld | 26 | 86 | 39 | 211 | 8.1 |
| Coleman | 26 | 68 | 53 | 189 | 7.2 |
| Lazenby | 18 | 25 | 31 | 81 | 4.5 |
| Osborne | 21 | 27 | 18 | 72 | 3.4 |
| McLean | 25 | 32 | 17 | 81 | 3.2 |
| Cook | 12 | 15 | 3 | 33 | 2.7 |
| Turk | 26 | 27 | 16 | 70 | 2.6 |
| Roddey | 19 | 14 | 9 | 41 | 2.1 |
| Hankins | 7 | 4 | 4 | 12 | 1.7 |
| Nimocks | 8 | 1 | 3 | 5 | 0.6 |
| Bowen | 8 | 1 | 1 | 3 | 0.3 |

An easy 43-20 win over the Pr. This picture should be proof enough that Coach Crowell Little has been putting
his gridders through some stiff workouts. On the left is George Nickels, freshman center, who has shown promise during the
spring drills. The other two are Jerry Kiser and Bill Reynolds, steady performers on last year’s squad. Both are sophomores.
Kiser plays a lot of mean tackle and Reynolds has shown up well in the backfield and has been recently
switched over to a tackle slot in the line.

Bill was an all-round athlete. He chose football as his favorite sport, made the varsity teams at Pomona Junior College
and at the University of Oregon. The 1st Observation Squadron, Fort Riley, Kansas was Lieutenant Reynolds’ first assignment. While there
he met the future Mrs. Reynolds. They married a year later and now have two fine sons.

ONLY KA 26; Ind. 16
The KA’s got off on the right foot by downing an off Independent team by 26-16. The points were well
divided among the KA's with Pryor and McKeithen with 6 and McWilliams and Adams had 5 each. Ritenburg for the
Independents was high with 6 and Herrin had 5 while Mapes had 4. Although the game was a low scoring
affair, it was fast with not many fouls being called on either side.

A Theta Chi, Bill enjoyed campus social life. Found that it eased the pressure of rugged athletics and his heavy
study schedule in Personnel Management. The Squadron moved to Panama, then the Pacific. Bill advanced from pilot to operations officer
to squadron commander. He came home a Major and qualified for a Regular Commission.

Major Bill Reynolds, Oregon 40
Pilot-Professor, U.S. Air Force!

Upon graduation, Bill chose a future in the Air Force. He “flew” his first Link trainer as an Aviation Cadet
in 1940. By March, 1941, he had won his pilot wings. Recently commended for peacetime work—organizing and improving instruction techniques—Major
Reynolds, a “Pilot-Professor,” looks forward to a long and gainful career in the U.S. Air Force.

If you are single, between the ages of 20 and 26½, with at least two years of college, consider the
many career opportunities as a pilot or navigator in the U.S. Air Force. Procurement Teams are visiting many colleges and
universities to explain these career opportunities. Watch for them. You may also get full details at your nearest Air Force
Base or U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force Recruiting Station, or by writing to the Chief of Staff, U.S. Air
Force, Att: Aviation Cadet Branch, Washington 25, D.C.
