Federoff receives First
Union teaching scholarship

By Beth Lindsey
Melissa A. Federoff has been
named the first recipient of the
First Union Teaching Scholarship
at Davidson.
A freshman from Muncie, In-
diana, Federoff attended the Indi-
ana Academy for her junior and
senior years in high school. It was
at this school that Federoff had
“the most unbelievable academic
experience” which has inspired her
to look toward a career in educa-
tion. “Teachers educated students
about life as well as academics,”
says Federoff.
Chair of the Education De-
partment Dr. Grace Mitchell ex-
plains that Federoff’s “unique com-
bination of activities and her well-
rounded personality allowed her to
stand apart from the rest.”

In high school, Federoff was
active in the “Feminists for Ac-
tion” group, an escort service on
campus, and was a supporter of
Amnesty International. She also
worked to help stage an exhibit of
the NAMES Project AIDS Memo-
rial Quilt at both the Indiana Acad-
emy and at Davidson.

She gained her most valuable
teaching experience when work-
ing as a tutor for underprivileged
children in low-income housing
sections of Muncie. Her work with
“Motivate our Minds,” a center
devoted to keeping children in
housing projects off drugs and pro-
viding them with emotional and
academic support, opened her mind
to the need for better education in
cities.

The First Union scholarship,
renewable for each of a student’s
four years at Davidson, was estab-
lished last year by the First Union
Foundation for students who have
expressed an interest in teaching.
The scholarship is part of a $1
million dollar gift from the First
Union Foundation to provide en-
dowed support for Davidson’s
education department.

The remainder of the funds
supports the department’s opera-
tions.

Debate persists concerning new social options for women

your chapter needs to be.”

Davidson as a campus would
decide how informal the rushing
process would be. Another option
involves an integration of sorori-
ties with eating houses ensuring a
place for every woman.

Despite these reassurances of
flexibility, concerns remained that
women could not switch houses
and someone would be left out.
These are two factors that our cur-
rent system prevents.

Senior Warner Hall member
Yvette Pita does not see the neces-
sity for sororities: “You become
friends with people because you
want to, not because of some insti-
tution.”

Wake Forest and Presbyterian
College provide possible parallels
to how a sorority system would
work at Davidson.

Wake Forest had national so-
rorities and societies which were
essentially sororities on a local
level, but a year ago the societies
were forced to gain national back-
ing because of insurance reasons.

While this produced contro-

funding.”

According to Clark, the loss
of federal support would have a
negative effect both locally and
nationally. At WDAV, the num-
ber of broadcast hours might have
to be curtailed, and the number of
on-air membership drives might
increase. On a national level, many
public stations that have a greater
dependence on federal funding
might fold. Those stations that
survive would likely have to pay
more for national shows like NPR
news programming, and might
even lose such programming.

Clark and others on the task
force urge those who support pub-
lic television and radio to write
their local Congressmen. While
the issue is still being debated on
the Hill, time may be running out.

versy on campus, Senior Becky
Plesco, President of the Chi Omega
chapter, told the audience the tran-
sition has turned out positively and
the national leaders helped them
throughout the whole process.

Sophomore Kirsten Nobman,
a fellow Chi Omega, is happy with
her situation but acknowledges
some pitfalls with sororities. She
says, “Rush is definitely not nice;
but the real world is not nice.”

Pita does not see the merit of
such a process, “I think sororities
have a really fake atmosphere. The
worst thing is the rushing process;
you have to get dressed up in some
stupid little outfit and go from house
to house and try to impress people
in 15 minutes.”

She also agrees with many
women that the lack of sororities at
Davidson was an appealing factor
when they applied.

Presbyterian College, which
is similar in size and structure to
Davidson, brought sororities onto
their campus five years ago.

At the meeting, Lee Hernberg,
president of Alpha Delta Pi, ex-
pressed how happy she is with the
way things have worked out. She

commented that for every one per-
son who falls through rush, there
are many more people who benefit
from the system.
A sophomore at Presbyterian
who rushed unsuccessfully for two
years acknowledges that “rush is a
good way of casually meeting
people; however I feel excluded
now that I’m not in [a sorority],
and it has created a rift with my
friends.”

Despite concerns about sorori-
ties on campus, Patterson Court
Advisor Kurt Holmes was quick to
downplay their immediacy.
Holmes says, “This is not
something the college is going to
rush into, but if we muster enough
interest, the school will look into
