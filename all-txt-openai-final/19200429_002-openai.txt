THE DAVIDSONIAN, April 29, 1920

JUNIORS AND SOPHS LEAD IN INTER-CLASS SERIES
Games Thus Far Played Slow and Uninteresting.

Not a few students paid their lone jit Monday to see the Juniors overcome the Seniors on Sprunt field in
the first of the inter-class baseball games, by the close score of 5 to 4. The Juniors scored two in
the second, but the Seniors came back with such force that the beginning of the eighth found them leading 4-2.
The Juniors pushed one across in both the eighth and ninth, thus tying the score. Douglas’ muff of Hodgin’s long
drive in the tenth gave them the game 5 to 4.

Batteries — Seniors: Brady and McConnell; Romefelt and Walker.

Fresh-Soph Game — Did any of you miss this wonderful exhibition of America’s greatest game last Tuesday? Of course, no
one expected you to stay throughout the whole game, for even the greater part of the 75 Fresh aspiring for
their team deserted before the end was reached. Inning after inning, the Sophs trotted around the bases until in the
ninth, when they stopped with the appropriate number of 22 runs, the Fresh receiving 4 in the meantime. The features
of the game were the chasing of flies by the “23rs” and the hitting of the whole Soph team.

Batteries—Sophs: Murphy and McFadden; Fresh: Sorrells and McCutchin.

D. C. GOLFERS BREAK EVEN WITH SALISBURY IN WELL PLAYED MATCHES

Fore! The match was on! Teeing off for the Davidson College Golf Club were Professor Arbuckle and Professors Wood, White,
and Sample, while Messrs. Hennessee, Hennessee, Pickens, and Walker did the trick for the Salisbury Golf Club. Playing over the
recently built and as yet incomplete golf course of the Salisbury club on the afternoon of April 19, 1920, the
two teams, after a hard-fought and interesting match, arrived at the last green with the honors divided. As an additional
proof that age and experience can’t be beat, it was the team composed of Professors Arbuckle and Wood that saved
the day for Davidson. The playing of these two gentlemen was consistent throughout and at times attained the brilliant strokesmanship
of professional play. Their younger colleagues, White and Sample, played consistent golf but were not able to hold up to
the standard set by their opponents. The Salisbury team played its usual consistent game but were not able to overcome
the flashy playing of the Professors. The Davidson team was accorded delightful entertainment and had a most enjoyable trip.

Davidson’s track team won its third victory in eight days when the “Speed Boys” took Clemson into camp to the
tune of 52-47. The meet was full of excitement from beginning to end. Davidson held the lead for the first
few moments, but Clemson soon began piling up points until the score stood Clemson 37, Davidson 26, with only four
events left. Davidson won three of these and came second in another and won the meet.

Clemson won seven of the eleven events, but Davidson won eight second places and eight thirds and saved the day
for the Red and Black. There were several good records made during the day. The most notable of these were:
Striebeck’s shot put of 39 feet, 4.5 inches; Colbert’s discus throw of 116 feet; and Boggs’ pole vault of 10
feet 6 inches. Voigt made good time in the dashes by taking the 100 yard dash in 10 seconds and
the 220 in 22 2-5 seconds. Captain Murray, of Davidson, was the high point winner of the day. He took
12 points during the day. Voigt, of Clemson, ran him a close second with 11 points. Murray was handicapped by
a sore knee and a weak ankle. He did not place in the broad jump. The meet was in doubt
until the last race, the 220 low hurdles. Davidson had to take a first or second place to win the
meet. This race had to be run by time. When the time of the runners had been compared it was
found that Davidson had won second and third places.A summary of the events follows:

DIAMOND DUST

The Wildcats are still on the heavy side of the percentage column, having won 6 and lost 5. These results
are only those compiled through the last game of the North Carolina trip. The results in hitting on the Carolina
trip caused the averages of most of the Clan to tumble. As a result, the batting order is well shaken
up. The team is hitting as follows:

| AB | H | Pet. |
|---|---|---|
| Shepard, p-lf | 39 | 12 | .307 |
| Cassell, E., 3b | 37 | 11 | .297 |
| Crawford, rf | 26 | 7 | .269 |
| *Poe, lf | 19 | 5 | .263 |
| Richards, cf | 33 | 8 | .242 |
| Cassell, F., ss | 21 | 5 | .238 |
| Wrenn, c | 34 | 8 | .235 |
| Ratchford, 2b | 42 | 9 | .214 |
| Huffstetler, ss | 17 | 3 | .176 |
| Currie, p | 16 | 2 | .125 |
| Miley, p | 9 | 1 | .111 |
| Johnson, c | 9 | 1 | .111 |
| McArn, 1b | 29 | 3 | .104 |
| Sample | 1 | 0 | .000 |

342 75 .219 (Including only last game on Carolina trip).

*Poe disqualified for remainder of season.

The twirling staff is holding up well and all are getting better as they go. Their standing is as follows:

| Won | Lost | Pct. |
|---|---|---|
| Currie | 4 | 1 | .800 |
| Miley | 2 | 1 | .666 |
| Shepard | 1 | 3 | .250 |

Currie has performed in five games. He has retired 33 via the strike-out route and has given 11 free passes.
Two batsmen have been hit. Miley has pitched three games. “Bill” has struck out 14 and walked 2. He has
pitched one no-hit game against Elon, and hasn’t passed a man for 22 innings. Shepard has pitched four games. Three
of these were against the strongest teams in the state and were lost by two-run margins. “Shep” has caused 25
to whiff and has passed 12.

Miley’s no-hit game against Elon Monday was a sensational affair. “Bill” allowed only one man to reach first, this on
an error, but he was cut off at second. Besides pitching the masterful game, “Bill” slammed out a single, a
triple, and walked in three trips to the plate.

880 yard run—1st, Dick, Davidson; 2nd, Going, Clemson; 3rd, Fricker, Davidson. Time, 2 minutes 7 seconds.

High jump—1st, Covington, Clemson; 2nd, Green, Davidson; 3rd, Gentry, Davidson. Height, 5 feet 8 inches.

220 yard dash—1st, Voigt, Clemson; 2nd, Murray, Davidson; 3rd, Brice, Davidson. Time, 22 2-5 seconds.

Pole vault—1st, Boggs, Clemson; 2nd, Williams, Clemson; 3rd, Green, Davidson. Height, 10 feet 6 inches.

Discus—1st, Colbert, Clemson; 2nd, Sutton, Davidson; 3rd, Roberts, Davidson. Distance, 116 feet.

REPORTERS’ CLUB HOLDS FEED

Plenty of Pep a Feature—Old and New Officers Hold Floor.

Last Thursday night was gala night for The Davidsonian scribes. It was feed night for the Reporters’ Club. The regular
club, the Freshman reporters, and all who have been writing at all were present. T. H. Spence presided over the
head-end of the table. Besides being the chief money-getter, he proved to be a very capable speech getter. He delegated
two Freshmen to give a yell—and he got the horse laugh. When the eats had disappeared and the boys had
stopped opening coca-cola, Spence introduced the officers chosen for next year. Bitzer, as secretary and treasurer, importuned the members to
be regular in attendance at meetings and help the secretary. Summers, the vice-president-to-be, gave a short, snappy speech on the
weather and other prevailing conditions. Mitchell, the president-elect, delivered an interesting and instructive address in which he outlined the platform
which he hopes to inaugurate during his term in office. After all the eats had disappeared, and all the hot
air had been exhausted, the room was turned over to a delegation of Freshmen and the boys retired downstairs, where
McIlwaine stood ready to strike at their beauty.

“Wooley” Grey, our next year’s football coach, was up to the Davidson-Clemson meet Saturday. “Wooley” expects to put out a
real old-time team next fall. After having speeches from the most prominent (?) men present,

Cape of Good Hope—Sweet sixteen.
Cape Flattery—Twenty.
Cape Lookout—Thirty.
Cape Farewell—Forty.

—Ward-Belmont Hyphen.
