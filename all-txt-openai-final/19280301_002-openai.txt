THE DAVIDSONIAN, MARCH 1, 1928

Sport Talk - News and Views of Wildcat Events
By Raymond Lake

The Wildcats raised their percentage of victories to 50 on their second trip as compared with 40 on their first jaunt, but even then the trip could hardly be called a success. It is true that they ended the season with a victory, and thus did much better than they might have done, but the decisive defeat they suffered at the hands of the Duke Blue Devils subtracted from the glory of this victory and pulled their percentage of victories on the trip down to 50.

That must have been some game last Thursday night with the Guilford Quakers. At the end of the second half the score stood 26 to 26, and only in the five-minute extra period were the Wildcats able to drop in the two baskets that won the game. We predicted in this column last week that the Davidson team would show some form in the last game, and they must have shown some to hold the Quakers down in the last period on their own court. The Guilford team, though of course inferior to the larger teams of the state, is a fast-working and excellent team for a school the size of Guilford.

The 1928 baseball season was officially opened last Friday when Manager Link called for the candidates to be out on the field at 3:00 o'clock ready to start the regular workouts. A large squad of men turned out and more are expected to report in the next few days. Practice has been held every clear afternoon for the last two weeks or more under the direction of Captain Dulin. Comparatively few were coming out until the official call was issued last Friday, but since then the number has increased greatly and regular and systematic workouts have been held each afternoon. Several more are expected to report when spring football is over to raise the number still more.

When the baseball schedule was announced some time ago, there were 22 games to be played, but since then one of these, with Furman, has been canceled, leaving a total of 21 games on the schedule. During the fall, there was some fear expressed that Captain Dulin would not be able to play this year on account of having played some during the past summer. However, he will be able to play in 19 of the 21 games on schedule, there being only two colleges out of the 21 that have rules which will bar him.

The track candidates have not yet been able to begin their regular workouts on the track. They have been working out in the gym or on the field when the weather permitted, under the direction of Captain Curry, but they have not yet been able to begin their regular practices. Coach Tex has been working with them since the close of the wrestling season, and as soon as the weather permits, which should be within the next few days, they will begin their daily outdoor practices. It will be much better for the team when practice can be held regularly out on the field as was shown by the accident which occurred during the workout in the gym last Thursday when one of the Freshmen fainted, fell on the floor, and knocked two front teeth out. The stuffiness of the air in the gym is said to have partially caused the trouble.

The Freshmen were not able to end their season as well as the varsity. After suffering four defeats on their trip, they returned to the hill and lost their last game to the Bingham team on their home floor. The Freshmen were in the lead during a large part of the game and it looked as if the game would end with them in the lead, but when the final whistle blew, the visitors were several points ahead. The Wildkittens fought hard and played well during most of the game, but they were not able to keep the lead when they got it. Several mistakes near the first of the game cost them several points and may have lost the game for them. The Freshman track season will be getting under way in a few days and perhaps the yearlings will uncover something in the way of track material that will overbalance, or at least counterbalance, their showing in the other sports so far this year.

Wildcat Five Captures Nine of Sixteen Games

The Davidson College basketball team completed its 1928 basketball season by winning over Guilford 30 to 27. This win was a fitting close for the season for the Wildcats in which they chalked up nine wins and seven defeats. The 'Cats started off the season by defeating the Salisbury “Y” 47 to 43 at Davidson. The Wildcats clashed with Duke next but were defeated by the score of 46 to 27. Furman and Guilford were both victors over Davidson by narrow margins, the scores being 33 to 25 and 28 to 26 respectively. Now the 'Cats began a series of victories by trimming Wofford 53 to 31, Elon 40 to 37, Salisbury “Y” 47 to 44, and Lenoir-Rhyne 40 to 33. The team next took a trip through South Carolina, during which they were defeated by Citadel, Clemson, and Furman, but won easily over the College of Charleston and Wofford. Back on the home grounds, the Wildcats took Wake Forest into camp to the tune of 51 to 27. In Durham, Duke being 51 to 33. The final game of the season was at Guilford, Davidson winning by the close score of 30 to 27.

The Wildcat team scored a total of 594 points during the season to 550 by their opponents. Pritchett led the scoring with 174 points with Wilson a close second with 160. The scores for the season are as follows:

Outlook Bright as Batmen Begin Work
By “Monk” Mattox

Baseball practice at Davidson College, which was scheduled to have commenced Wednesday afternoon, got under way Thursday after being delayed by inclement weather. “Monk” Mattox, Davidson Freshman athletic director and former Washington and Lee diamond ace, will direct the Wildcat baseball activities for several weeks until “Monk” Younger, varsity coach, assumes control. Battery aspirants have been working for the past two weeks under the direction of Captain Johnnie Dulin, and are said to have developed considerable speed and accuracy. Lee Meadows, “Doc” Henderson, and John McInnis form the nucleus around which Coach Younger will build his corps of twirlers. Henderson and McInnis were members of last year’s Freshman nine, while Cathey is one of the best collegiate wrestlers in the ACL. During the season, he won four of his matches, while two resulted in ties, thus maintaining his excellent record of never having lost a match within his own exercise.

Davidson mat team won its initial match on December 16, in a one-sided affair, when it administered an overwhelming defeat.Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

and Meadows are veterans of varsity service. Paul Mauldin, for the past two years a varsity substitute, looms as a likely addition to the ranks of the first-string moundsmen. Dick Grey and English McGeachey, both gridiron stars, will in all probability handle the receiving end of the Davidson batteries. Prospects for a winning club are unusually bright. Seven members of the 1927 team will be back in uniform when the Wildcats open their season on March 23rd against Oak Ridge. This does not include the twirlers and receivers named above, and does not take into consideration the new material that was produced by the Freshman nine last season. Ratchford and Johnson, outfielders; Kugler, Dulin, Harrison, Littlejohn and Crawford, infielders, are the varsity men who reported for the initial practice Thursday afternoon. Among the members of last year’s Freshman team who are seeking varsity positions this year are “Tuc” McConnell and Miller, outfielders; and Parrish and Kugler, infielders; Hugh Arrowood, gridiron performer for several years and one-time high school diamond star, will be a candidate for a position on the varsity this spring.

In the program Monday, the coach introduced stiff batting practice. The team was also put to some infield work. Two games are slated to open the season before the Northern trip into Virginia. Immediately following this trip, two big games are scheduled: Carolina in Salisbury on Easter Monday, and the University of Pennsylvania here on the following Tuesday.

Wildcat Grapplers Conclude Schedule
Davidson Defeats State in Final Match, Bringing Number of Victories to Four

With their match at Raleigh Monday night, the Davidson wrestling team brought to a conclusion a successful season. Handicapped by the loss of captain Frierson and the other stars of last year’s team, the Wildcat grapplers began the season with rather mediocre prospects. Under the leadership of Captain “Jeff” Garrison, however, the team has shown considerable stamina and ability, and the results of the season have been much better than initial prospects indicated. Captain Garrison who graduates this year, led his team to the close of a successful season, and proved his ability as class. Beginning the season with a rush, the defeat to the Concord “Y” team. Captain Garrison and his men won every match except one by falls, the other match being of the Wildcats. On January 31, Davidson swamped the Concord “Y” team for the second time of the season. The match was an interesting one from the spectators' viewpoint, however, and furnished frequent thrills for the fans. Concord did not register a fall or decision until the final match, in a little over nine minutes. In the third match of the season, on February 4, the Davidson wrestlers gained a victory over the University of North Carolina team by a score of 13 1-2 to 7 1-2. The Wildcats won four of the seven matches and Carolina two, the other being a draw. All of the matches were won by a decision, not a single fall being registered. The six bouts that were won by one side or the other required an extra period each to decide the match.

Fresh Five Downed by Bingham Cadets

Davidson’s Freshman basketeers have played their last game of a big season. The last game was with Bingham, and was a hard-fought battle, the Davidson Wildkittens displaying their fighting ability but failing to win at the last moment. The final score was 22-19. For Davidson, Goodson made the highest running score, while LePerr scored the highest for Bingham. The number of field goals for Davidson was 8, and for Bingham 9. Under the leadership of their captain, Dean Rusk, the Wildkittens have won three games, and most of the other games were lost by close scores. They have fought hard in every game and have shown that Wildcat spirit. Following is a list of the games played and the scores of each:

most interesting match of the meet was in the 145 pound class, when Captain Garrison of Davidson opposed Captain Abbott of Carolina. Garrison barely missed getting a decision over his opponent, after two extra periods had been fought, missing a decision by only a few seconds. In the next match February 1, Davidson lost to the Virginia Military Institute grapplers by a score of 13 1-2 to 9 1-2. The teams were evenly matched, and but one fall was registered, that coming in the unlimited class when Christenberry of Davidson threw Haase of V. M. I. Flythe won over his opponent with a time decision while Captain Garrison’s match resulted in a tie. On February 25, Davidson met the strong Duke team in Durham, and bowed in defeat by a score of 20-3. Victory went to the Blue Devils by reason of five time decisions and one fall. Captain Jeff Garrison, winning his match over Jennings of Duke by a time decision, was the lone scorer for the Wildcats. In their final match of the season last Monday night, Davidson won a decisive victory over the North Carolina State grapplers at Raleigh. The score, 17-8, was the result of time decisions in all matches but two. Hill won over Day of State by a fall, while Baker’s match was forfeited when the Wildcat wrestler was knocked out, after putting up a game fight. This match, the last of the season, brings the total number of victories to four, with two losses.
