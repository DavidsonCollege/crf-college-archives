‘Doggone It,’ Says Fred

From Our Wire Services

EAST CANNON, N. C. Police reached a new brutality high Sunday evening as a member of security attempted to run
down and kill one of the beloved friends of the peasants in this rural village. In an unfortunate clash in
an East Cannon alley between two groups of peasants, the security force attacked one of the groups’ members, identified only
as “Fred.” The cause of the clash is uncertain, though speculation ran high that it was provoked by the government
of the region, designed to split the peasants and weaken their pro-war forces against the government’s oppression, which has centered
on four broad areas.

Numerous witnesses, however, testified that the crowbar-wielding agent of the Establishment forces repeatedly threatened Fred. They reported that the peasant
reacted bravely, and that when severely threatened, even attacked the agent. “The agent’s wrath knew no bounds,” said one of
the peasants. “He just kept rushing at Fred with that crowbar.” Cornered, the peasant somehow managed to flee from the
alley. He sought refuge near the village laundry, after leaving his assailant far behind. In a desperate attempt to catch
up with the helpless peasant, the security agent sprang behind the wheel and began to pursue his innocent victim, chasing
him all the way to nearby Belk, N. C. Catching up with the peasant, he tried to run down the
victim. Seeking shelter, “Fred” tried to hide behind the branches of some shrubbery in the middle of a Belk traffic
circle. Not to be evaded, the agent crashed through the shrubbery, taking a large part of it with him.

A number of older peasants, vigilant in their struggle against police brutality, militarism, and the government’s ever-increasing oppression, rushed to
their fellow’s aid, charging after the agent and his truck. Shouts of “Fred lives” and “Kill the Pig” were coming
from all sections of the gathering crowd of peasants. A number of Belk residents also denounced the mutilation of the
shrubbery as a spoliation of the natural environment, or water pollution. “Defoliation is an act of aggression whether practiced in
Vietnam or Belk,” said one alert youth, who was busy passing out leaflets.

**Sigma Chi Disaffiliation Dissention Splits House**

BY STEVE ROADY
Staff Writer

The Sigma Chi vote to end its national affiliation last week did not come without a fight. In fact, the
matter is still the cause of some dissention within the house. Junior Keith Everett and Bob Buchanan, a senior, this
week discussed the reasons behind the action, which came in the form of a 37-14 vote (with four abstentions) to
disaffiliate.

Everett cited several reasons for the action. The “social acceptance” clause in the national Sigma Chi constitution amounts to discrimination
against blacks, he said, and many brothers have long been opposed to it. In addition, the national office has, in
the opinion of some brothers, Everett said, been less than honest in its dealings with local Sigma Chi chapters (including
Davidson’s chapter) who have pledged blacks. At the Sigma Chi national convention this summer, said Everett, 10 amendments to the
Constitution were proposed, all of which Davidson's chapter backed, and all of which were defeated. The alumni chapters were mainly
responsible for the defeat of these liberal amendments, said Everett, as most of the undergraduate chapters voted for them.

The happenings at the Convention prompted Everett and Sigma Chi President Jerry Kroll to begin drawing up this fall a
series of agendas for meetings to review the situation. It was this series of meetings that ended with the vote
to go local. Although emphasizing that the discrimination question provided the main impetus for action, Everett stated that the belief
on the part of some brothers that a national fraternity was unrealistic for Davidson served also to sustain the disaffiliation
momentum.

Buchanan agreed that the discrimination question was the major source of local discontent, but he defended the “less than honest”
actions by the National office in its dealings with chapters which have pledged blacks by asking “What are you going
to do in the face of government interference?” Buchanan doesn’t object to the “social acceptance” clause as long as it’s
fairly applied.

The minority regards the vote as unfair, said Buchanan, because “bull pledges” and social affiliates were allowed to vote in
addition to initiated brothers. And although 2/3 of those voting chose to disaffiliate, less than 2/3 of the initiated brothers
voted to disaffiliate, he said. Buchanan also contended that several brothers voted to disaffiliate in order to preserve house unity,
though they would have preferred to keep the charter. “I would say that there are around 20 boys down there
who want the charter to remain on campus, and that’s what we're going to try to do.”

He pointed out that those who wished to remain affiliated had presented a compromise whereby individual Sigma Chis could have
disaffiliated from the national office but remained at the house. But this proposal, although approved by a special committee, was
defeated by a vote of the brothers. Those who favored going local asserted that such a plan would only result
in the revocation of the local chapter, since national technically doesn’t allow social affiliation. Buchanan disagrees with this thesis, stating
that he talked to a province Sigma Chi official who said that the local chapter would not have its charter
revoked if such individual disaffiliation took place. Everett, on the other hand, asserted that Kroll had been informed directly from
the national office that the charter would be revoked if the compromise were put into effect.

Everett and Buchanan also differ in their outlook on the future of the former Sigma Chi house at Davidson. Buchanan
would say only that he was pessimistic for the future while Everett stated that Davidson's first local social eating club
plans to go all out in rush and hopes to form “a selective group.”

At 10 a.m. Wednesday morning, as a part of Davidson College's Vietnam Moratorium program, a capacity crowd in the Morrison
Room of the Union held a teach-in on the war, in which President Richard Nixon and Vice-President Spiro Agnew received
firm rebukes from Professor W. E. Jackson. L. F. Griffin, a prominent civil rights worker, was scheduled to speak but
has been hospitalized for a bleeding ulcer. Dr. Alan B. Brinkley, Associate Professor of Philosophy, made the first speech, naming
five “just war” criteria: (1) Whether we have exhausted all possible means of reconciliation, (2) whether the war has been
declared, (3) whether the South Vietnamese government is a desirable alternative to the Viet Cong, (4) whether we can achieve
our objectives through military means, and (5) whether we are in fact preserving more than we are destroying. On these
five counts, Brinkley condemned the war in Vietnam. We have, he said, turned down several peace initiatives proposed by the
North Vietnamese. He pointed out that half a million men have been committed to battle without a formal declaration of
war; instead, the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution was passed, which, he charged, gave President Lyndon Johnson a blank check to
carry out whatever foreign policy he wished.

Dr. Thomas A. Williams, Jr., Associate Professor of French, followed him to the rostrum, and quoted French philosopher Blaise Pascal:
“All the world’s troubles are caused by the fact that a man can't go into a room, sit down, and
be happy.” (Man needs causes, Williams added.) During John F. Kennedy's early administration, he said, people were excited.be cause Kennedy
seemed to show an understanding that society today should no longer be based on greed, but on “something new: love,
openness, and generosity.” Dr. Robert Lennox, Instructor of Education, quoted a petition signed by over two thousand American psychologists which
said, “War is not innate.” Lennox claimed that social engineering can redirect the destructive impulses in man that lead to
war. A just foreign policy, he said, would grant a large measure of self-determination to the two-thirds of the human
race which is nonwhite.

NEVER SAY DIE (Staff Photo by Davidson) Clodfelter gives EPC members the sophomore plan. equivalent to air urging a general
worker's strike on Wednesday. The scene of the chase shifted to another neighborhood community, Fraterni town, a citadel of bourgeois
reaction, but even there the peasants gained support. Reportedly, “Fred was seized there by the agent and bodily thrown into
the truck. He was then carried away. Reports that a national reaction has labeled the act as ‘yet another example
of brutal repression,’ which has been added to the area oppression adding insult to injury. Approached by members of the
community on the county administrator Spencer Samuelson gratuitously replied in the manner of a national leader, “That's a very good
question, I'm glad you asked it.” To comment on the incident, Dr. William E. Jackson, Assistant Professor of Political Science,
indicted Lyndon Johnson for involving this country “in a disastrous war.” He read many quotes from former Secretary of Defense
Robert McNamara, former President Lyndon Johnson, and members of their government, which predicted success in Vietnam. (See TEACH-IN, Page 6)

Misty Peace Day Asks War’s End Light Professors Attack Nixon-Agnew War Aims

WEDNESDAY a chance Responsibilities Program Begins In keeping with the program established by last year’s Code of Responsibility, the administration
this week began its series of programs for freshmen regarding personal responsibility with alcohol, sex, and drugs. In the first
of six programs planned by the college, Dr. Ronald B. Simono of the Counseling Center at the University of North
Carolina at Charlotte, spoke on “Mental Health for College Students,” Monday. Next week Dr. Myron Clodfelter, Sophomores Hit Sandifer of
the University of Kentucky Medical School will talk on the “Historical and Physical Aspects of Alcohol.” A week later, H.
Middleton Raynal, of the Lee-Harnett County Mental Health Service in Sanford, will discuss the “Social and Legal Aspects of Alcohol.”
Two representatives from offices at Chapel Hill and an officer of the U.S. Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs in
Washington will complete the programming.

Support Higher Than Expected The speeches were spoken, the slides were shown, the songs were sung, the obscenities were shouted
and after it was all over Davidson knew that there was more student interest in ending the war in Vietnam
than anyone had suspected. The long-heralded Vietnam Moratorium got underway Wednesday with its anti-war slides, folk songs, marathon speeches by
faculty members and a call to arms by ex-student Marvin Sparrow. The day-long forum on the Vietnam problem began in
Cunningham Fine Arts Center at 10 a.m. with a slide show presented by Instructor Herb Jackson and attended by several
professors and about fifty students. Jackson encouraged the audience to “juxtapose each image with others you've seen... on the war.”
The slides shown included ultramodern assemblages, bullfight scenes, Goya’s “Execution of the Rioters,” Greek bas reliefs of men battling centaurs,
Picasso’s “Guernica,” Goya's “Saturn Devouring One of His Sons,” an anti-Nazi painting by German artist George Grosz, a pop-art blow-up
of a revolver, and Michelangelo’s fresco of the Last Judgement. After the showing, crayons, colored chalk, pencils, magic markers, and
paper were provided to participants who wished to make their own visual statement about the war. Several of the sketches
were later put on display in the lobby of the Union.

L. F. Griffith, a civil rights worker who has fought for the desegregation of schools in Prince Edward County, Va.,
and who was scheduled to speak of the war's effect on national priorities, phoned Tuesday night to explain that he
had been hospitalized and was unable to attend. In Griffith's place three Davidson professors Dr. Alan B. Brinkley, Dr. Thomas
A. Williams, and Dr. Robert Lennox gave their views on the war to a capacity audience in the Morrison Room.
After William's speech, ex-Davidson student Marvin Sparrow rose, charging that the participants were sitting around ineffectively while people were dying.
Later, in the afternoon, he listed several things he thought the students should do: support the Black Panther Party, and
boycott Merita Bread, Saran Wrap, and the federal excise tax on telephones. He urged the students to attend precinct party
meetings and to organize the janitors and fraternity cooks into a union.

At 1 p.m., the Eumanean Literary Society held a poetry reading which was open to all who wished to read.
At 2 a large crowd met in the Morrison Room to hear the remarks of five more Davidson professors. Dr.
William E. Jackson, Assistant Professor of Political Science, led off with a well-documented indictment of past and present Vietnam policies
and received a standing ovation. Dr. Max E. Polley, Professor of Bible and Religion, speaking on the Christian attitude toward
Nationalism, recalled a Quaker friend who had burned himself to death protesting U.S. military policy. Dr. R. L. Avinger, Assistant
Professor of Economics, discussed the cost of the war. Dr. Frederick Gaige of the South Asian studies program discussed the
economic impact of the war. (See MORATORIUM, Page 6)
