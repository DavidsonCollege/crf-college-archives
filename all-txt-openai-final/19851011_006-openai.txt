Davidson old-timer recalls past experiences

By NELLE McCORKLE
“Along Main Street” is a new regular feature. Please submit suggestions for your favorite Davidsonian to the newspaper in care of Nelle McCorkle.

“Bye, Dottie.”

Twirling in his desk chair, Bub Cashion announces, “That was the first lady of North Carolina.”

“Dottie” is Mrs. Jim Martin, one of the many friends of Robert J. (Bub) Cashion, owner of Cashion’s Gulf Station on Main Street.

Since he began operating the station in 1966, Cashion has served the cars of two North Carolina governors and of countless Davidson students. He has lived all his life in Davidson.

A generous supporter of varied town causes, Cashion still manages to find time to take a student's bicycle to Charlotte — twice — for repairs, refusing to accept payment except for the materials.

Stopping by the station in mid-afternoon, you’re likely to find Cashion under an engine. If you’re fortunate, though, he’ll be in the station’s office, swapping stories with friends.

One favorite Cashion story involves former Davidson College President Samuel Spencer: “Dr. Spencer had bought an old police car for his son Frank to drive. Eventually, that car just quit and wouldn't run anymore, and the Spencers left it in the yard. One afternoon, I got a call from Mrs. Spencer. She said, ‘Please come pull that car out of the yard. The Trustees are coming!’”

Cashion’s wife Edith is also a Davidson native; she is the daughter of F.D. Hobart, former Superintendent of Building and Grounds for the College. The Cashions have a son, a sophomore at Appalachian State University.
