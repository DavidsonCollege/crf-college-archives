**Financial Aid Scams**

“If you are suspicious of a scholarship offer, call or visit your school’s financial aid office,” advises Mark Kantrowitz of the Financial Aid Information Network. “Every year thousands of families fall prey to fraudulent scholarship offers. They work by imitating legitimate foundations, scholarship sponsors, lenders, and search services. They use official-sounding names like ‘National,’ ‘Federal,’ ‘Federation,’ and ‘Division’ to fool unwary parents and students. Students should beware of application fees, even ones as miraculously low as two dollars. These companies can pay out a scholarship or two if they award any at all,” warned Kantrowitz.

**Phonathon Approaching**

The annual Davidson fundraising drive is scheduled to take place from Sunday, March 17th, to Thursday, March 21st, in the Chambers Gallery. All houses and Independents have been assigned a day to work the Phonathon.

**Buford Addresses Minors**

At the recent SGA meeting, President Warren Buford discussed minors, stating, “The question of the faculty is not whether students want minors, but why. Professors desire students to approach them in person to advocate the proposal and answer objections to it.” He then outlined a lobbying timetable for minors for the next two weeks that will include a student-faculty roundtable and “minors tables” located in Chambers.

**SGA Debates Dorm Storm ‘96**

Jonathan Sipling (Freshman Class Senator) spoke at the SGA meeting regarding Dorm Storm ‘96, a program in which SGA Senators would divide into pairs and be responsible for polling students in a certain geographic area of the campus. Some senators agreed with the plan, while others found flaws within it. Senior Senator Rick Onkey stated he felt that this plan would be “a lot of time commitment for very little benefit,” and other senators felt that the plan would work best if they polled their own constituents, which would be difficult considering living arrangements. President Warren Buford closed the discussion by announcing a forum would be open to all senators during the SEC meeting at 7 p.m. Sunday to discuss suggestions to reform the plan.

**Independent Senators**

If anyone is interested in being an Independent Senator, they should contact Election Council Chairman Saad Gul (-6172) or SGA Chancellor Adam Hickey (-2147).

**Merit-Based Scholarships Available**

Students who did not receive merit-based scholarships in 1995-96 but plan to apply for 1996-97 should pick up application materials at the Financial Aid Office, 413 N. Main Street by Friday, March 15, 1996.

**Need-Based Financial Aid Available**

Students who did not receive need-based financial aid in 1995-96 but plan to apply for 1996-97 should pick up application materials at the Financial Aid Office by March 1, 1996.

**Minorities from page 1**

The College’s commitment to the increased hiring of minorities. The committee’s recommendations urge the school to strengthen that commitment by ensuring that “a department’s obligation to search for qualified black candidates doesn’t end with the hiring of one African-American member.” The study also wants to prevent stereotypes from being applied to minority professors, asking “the college to be open-minded in its search for African-Americans and not fall victim to the assumption that African-American faculty will have teaching interests that relate only to minority issues and or that African-American administrators will be primarily interacting with minority students.”

Finally, the study’s recommendations urge the college to continue to forge links with Johnson C. Smith University and other historically black colleges and universities. This move would allow the college to begin faculty exchange programs and possibly create a few temporary positions for minority professors.

Next Week: The Self Study discusses gender issues, from women faculty to male/female relations on campus.

**Beyond your resume, why do you think we should have minors at Davidson?**give students an opportunity to branch out and pursue individual interests.

Freshman Lorraine Harron: I think minors would allow a student to receive an in-depth education in a subject area that they enjoy, but do not want to commit ten courses to study it. Often deciding on a major is a hard choice; if everyone could choose the less vigorous option of the minor, then they might not feel so bad if they were not happy with their major.

Freshman Derek Wenzel: A liberal arts college is supposed to have its focus on learning, not always a resume. Minors would enhance the learning experience here by allowing students who really enjoy a subject but can’t major in it because of parental pressures or other reasons to still have a chance to receive a structured in-depth education in a discipline they find fascinating.

Sophomore David Jackson: Minors would help add to the diverse interests and talents that many students already possess. Right now, many people have to follow those urges by double majoring, possibly overextending themselves. Minors would allow motivated students a more realistic route to follow up on whatever they desire.

Sophomore Robert Knight: If I wanted to double major I wouldn’t have room for any other classes. All I would be taking is my major requirements and my core requirements... [double majors] leave no room for other interests.

Freshman Julie Baskin: [Minors] allow you to have a deeper breadth of knowledge to draw from.

Junior Caroline Polster: Our schedules are so limited now... I just think it would give us a better opportunity to expand on what we want to take.

Freshman Alexis Wood: [Minors would allow you] to focus on more than one subject area if you’re interested in more than one thing.

Freshman April Edlin: [Minors] are stronger than a concentration... but not as strong as a major. They give you more focus.

Freshmen Jessica Goodson and Andrew Letizia: I think that right now students are interested in multiple disciplines, but aside from the guidance students have in their majors, they don’t have direction to gain a basic and core foundation of knowledge within a second discipline. Having a set of six recommended courses within a department... would help students who would like to pursue a second area of interest.

Freshman Jonathan Sipling: Because [minors] give you more in-depth knowledge about a subject area.

Junior Allen Marshall: If you have dual interests, and one interest is stronger than the other, minors are a good way to explore both subjects without having to give up a true liberal arts education.

Senior Jill Dyer: I would like to expand the forefront of my knowledge to extend beyond the capacity of my major.

Sophomore Byron Faler: If students choose to take five or six classes in one discipline, I don’t see why it wouldn’t hurt to give them the credit they deserve.

Senior Isaac Squires: Offering minors means offering yet another academic benefit to students in the same spirit that we already offer double majors and concentrations. In this sense, it fits nicely in Davidson’s overall mission of providing a good and challenging liberal arts education.

Junior Warren Buford: With minors, you have a guide for the broadest based education possible.

Senior Sally Atlas: Minors would be an incentive to excel in an area of interest other than the major.

Sophomore Leigh Gaston: The faculty argues that minors are the antithesis of a liberal arts education, but I see minors as encouragement to pursue more than one area of study, which actually epitomizes the liberal arts education. They would also bring more ‘business’ to the smaller disciplines, such as art history, which typically have very few majors.

Junior Noni Nielson: I just want the damn things.

Sophomore J.R. Romenowski
