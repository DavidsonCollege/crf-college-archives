#### Crimestoppers Program Introduced At Davidson
By Tom Price

Crimestoppers, a nationwide organization that allows citizens to report crimes anonymously and receive rewards for their efforts, has reached Davidson.
The North Mecklenburg Crimestoppers includes the communities of Davidson College, the town of Davidson, Cornelius, and Huntersville. In the past,
Davidson and the other towns were included in the Mecklenburg County Crimestoppers. The rapid population growth of the northern part
of the county convinced Davidson, Cornelius, and Huntersville that a separate organization was needed.

Officer D.E. McLaurin is the contact person for the Campus Crimestoppers and wants Davidson students to become more involved. “We
know it works,” he explained, “Cornelius has already cleared 3 or 4 cases.” The system only works, however, if people
are willing to call in and report what they have seen or heard. As an incentive to calling in, rewards
are offered for information leading to an arrest. Crimestoppers pays up to $1000, depending on the case.

The North Mecklenburg Crimestoppers meet once a month to determine the size of awards and to discuss other business. The
whole process is totally confidential. When citizens call in, they are not asked to reveal their name. Instead, they are
assigned a number. If the caller receives a reward, he or she may obtain the money in any fashion they
wish so as to maintain confidentiality. Officer McLaurin explained that if a student was to receive a reward for his
cooperation and wanted to maintain his anonymity, Crimestoppers would even “be willing to ride by his dorm and throw the
money out the window.”

Crimestoppers works for any kind of crime. From minor theft to drug dealing to murder, the system is designed to
help police solve all types of cases. The main point, though, is that Crimestoppers doesn’t work at all unless citizens
pick up the phone.

#### Campus Crime Watch
By Tom Koonce

Along with the persistent problem of bicycles being stolen, this year has also seen the continued inane prank of pulling
fire alarms. On Saturday, September 14, a student from UNC and a student from Duke were charged with molesting the
fire alarm system. These two people are awaiting trial for this misdemeanor. Even though these two people were outsiders, Davidson
students are often the ones who are guilty of pulling fire alarms.

The warning is as follows:

**GIVING FALSE ALARM; MOLESTING FIRE ALARM SYSTEM.**—It shall be unlawful for any person or persons to wantonly and willfully give
or cause to be given, or to advise, counsel, or aid and abet anyone in giving a false alarm of
fire, or to break the glass key protector, or pull the slide arm, or lever of any station or signal
box of any fire alarm system, except in case of fire or willfully misuse or damage a portable fire extinguisher
or in any way to willfully interfere with, damage, molest, or injure any part or portion of any fire alarm
(fire detection, smoke detection or fire extinguishing) system. Any person violating any of the provisions of this section shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00), imprisonment for not more than
six months, or both. (General Statutes)of North Carolina) May 21, 1976

1. It's easy to use. Bring home an Apple® Macintosh® computer today, and use it to complete assignments by tonight—even
if you've never used a computer before.

2. Macintosh uses familiar words, such as Copy and Print, and pictures, such as file folders for storing your documents
and a trash can for files you want to throw away.

3. You don’t have to be a computer science major to set one up. Just plug everything together, flip the
“on” switch, and you're ready to roll. To place the chart in another document, just choose the Paste command. Learn
to use one Macintosh program, and you've learned the basics of using them all. For example, the commands you use,
such as Open, Close, Copy, Paste, Save, Cut, Print, and Undo, are found in the same place—every time.

4. It can grow with you. This week you're majoring in philosophy, next week it’s nuclear physics. After all, no
one knows exactly what the future will bring. That's why millions of students have found that investing in a Macintosh
is a smart move. Because Macintosh can immediately help you do whatever you do—better. And if, come tomorrow, you find
you want to do something different, no problem. It’s easy to upgrade your Macintosh to help you rise to the
challenge.

5. It’s great for college and beyond. Doing your work faster, better, and more creatively is also a plus in
the real world. That’s why Macintosh computers are used in 74 percent of colleges.

6. It’s got connections. To connect a printer, a modem, an external hard disk, or just about any other peripheral
to a Macintosh, simply plug it in. That's all there is to it.

7. It lets you work with every Macintosh. Every Macintosh is equipped with an Apple SuperDrive™, a unique floppy disk
drive that can use not only Macintosh disks, but also MS-DOS and OS/2 disks created on IBM and IBM-compatible computers.
With SoftPC from Insignia Solutions, you can even run MS-DOS applications on your Macintosh.

8. It’s so easy to network. Just connect the LocalTalk® cable from one Macintosh to another Macintosh. It takes just
a few minutes, and you don’t have to buy any additional hardware or software.

9. You can connect to your school’s mainframe or network. With Macintosh, you can send in assignments, gain access to
software you need for a class, and receive lecture notes, class schedules, and other information—right from your own room.

10. It's more affordable than ever. Macintosh prices have never been lower—especially with the student discount.

These reasons all add up to the power of Macintosh. The power to be your best®.
