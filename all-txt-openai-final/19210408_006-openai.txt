**THE DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 8, 1921**

**HENRY ELLIOT SHEPHERD WORTHY DAVIDSON ALUMNUS**

The subject of this sketch was born at Fayetteville, N.C., January 17, 1844. His father was Jesse George Shepherd, one
of the most accomplished lawyers, jurists, and gentlemen that North Carolina has produced. His mother was Catherine Dobbin, sister of
J. C. Dobbin, Secretary of the Navy, in the cabinet of Mr. Pierce.

At the age of seven, Mr. Shepherd entered the school of Miss Mary Weeks on Haymount. From here he was
transferred to the Donaldson Academy where he was prepared for college. When he was but 14, Mr. Shepherd entered the
Freshman class at Davidson College. The call to training for military service was too strong, however, and he followed his
teacher, Major D. H. Hill, to the Military Academy which they established in Charlotte.

He was scarcely 17 when the blast blew, but he was soon in the field of service. His first position
was that of instructor to raw recruits in Raleigh, N.C. In the spring of 1862, he was advanced to the
rank of first lieutenant in the 43rd N.C. troops and was probably, at the time of his appointment, the youngest
commissioned officer in the armies of the Confederacy. At Gettysburg, he was dangerously wounded and taken captive. After a long
and cruel captivity, he found his way to his desolate North Carolina home where the smokes were still rising from
Sherman's fires.

Soon after the close of the war, he taught school in Louisburg, N.C. From there he went to Baltimore, where
at the age of 24 he was elected to the chair of History and English in the City College. This
trust he resigned in 1882 to assume the presidency of the College of Charleston, S.C. He caused five years of
wonderful progress there, and then returned to Baltimore to give his entire time to writing. Many noble volumes have been
the result of his efforts. Mr. Shepherd has gained eminent success throughout the United States as a lecturer. In religion,
he is a Presbyterian, and in all his sentiments, sympathies, convictions, and ideals he is heartily Southern. He has in
contemplation for the future an even greater work than has rewarded his past efforts. Davidson will continue to watch and
hope for unlimited success—as she has in the past—to crown the labors of her worthy son, Henry Elliot Shepherd.
