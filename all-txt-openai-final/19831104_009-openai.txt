Highlight 1983 Homecoming

October 28-30 marked Davidsonâ€™s first big weekend of the 1983-84 school year.

Perfect weather and high spirits made Homecoming 1983 a great success. From Trustee/alumni golfers to Kitty Dudley being crowned Queen,
young and old alike shared a break from more mundane concerns. The weekend illustrated how well Davidson responds to tradition.
