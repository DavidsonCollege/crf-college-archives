**IT’S HAPPENING**

**Light, Whipped Cream And Onion Sandwiches**

By BILL SEIGLER
Associate Editor

"It's a bombardment of sounds, light, paint, whipped cream and onion sandwiches which creates an atmosphere having no meaning." That
is how Instructor of Fine Arts Rob Williams describes Davidson's first "happening," which will take place Friday night, April 28th,
at 8 PM at Hodson Hall as part of the Davidson Fine Arts Festival.

A happening, in Williams’ words, is "an art of our time," a modern dramatic phenomenon which has no plot, reason,
or real purpose. "It's just created insanity, a drug experience without drugs." Although it is hard if not impossible to
define, a happening is involved with communications, with the creation of an environment which should arouse some type of feeling
in the audience to the point that there is no longer an audience, but instead an extension of the characters
participating.

Artistically, Williams explained, a happening belongs to the neo-dada tradition in that it is actually anti-art. "It rejects laws and
attacks bourgeois sensitivity." There is no limit to the range of happenings, examples of which include a girl marrying a
Volkswagen, a boy reading a book and then burning the pages, and a hazardous voyage across a courtyard of tires.
The actors need no training; the stage can be anywhere.

The stage for Davidson's happening will be in the drama workshop. Williams advises that people wishing to attend should wear
old clothes "that are expressive of their personalities" and feel free to follow whatever impulses are created in them at
the happening. Like all happenings, the Davidson one will be designed to be irrational; it will attempt to make participants
transcend their physical bodies and enter the realm of the imagination. "Its only justification," Williams commented, "is that through it
perhaps you will experience something you have not experienced."

**Visiting Artist Urges Belief, Honesty**

By HERB JACKSON

The goal of the artist is to create a work in which he can believe, and then being not quite
satisfied, move on to the next problem, according to Maud Gatewood.

**MAUD GATEWOOD**
"Guided By Integrity, I Continue"

Monday, Miss Gatewood delivered a lecture at noon on "The Significance of Certain Painters." In the afternoon she held a
critical session in the art studio, warning students to be aware of their influences. Questions such as the meaning of
art were raised, to which Miss Gatewood replied, "There is a point at which you do not wish to find
all the answers, to classify or categorize. It's like a love affair you understand too well—it will get boring."

Tuesday evening, after lecturing during the day at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, where she is associate professor
of art, Miss Gatewood returned to Davidson for a session on "The Role of the Artist." She explained the problem
facing the creator who is assaulted by modern communication media. He must be aware of what is happening in the
art world and still maintain a basic integrity that allows him to absorb, restate, but not become derivative to the
point of imitation. In the studio, his main concern is with the making of the painting, but he must also
deal with the buying public in an age when art is bought and sold like shares of stock.

During the month of April, an exhibition of Maud Gatewood's work is on display in the Cunningham Fine Arts Building.
The honesty of her intellectual approach to the problem of art is reflected in the bold application of paint to
the canvas, but often the painter is better as a craftsman than the paintings show. "The longer I paint, the
simpler, yet more subtle and thus more difficult my purpose becomes," she said. "What is involved is never quite pinpointed
and is continually changing; so, guided by integrity, I continue this pursuit." That is to say, as a creator her
perception of environment and actual application of paint are often superior to the understanding of color and sense.

**Arts Festival Theme Is "What’s Going On"**

By SAM DARBY
Staff Writer

The Fine Arts Festival is a month-long celebration through which the various departments will attract student interest "by performing, displaying,
talking and informing the general populace of 'what’s going on.'" Featured earlier this month were Peter Taylor, the short story
writer who presented the Vereen Bell award; Jose Molina Bailes Espanoles; the Drama Workshop production of Endgame; a recital by
Grier Williams and Anita Bultan; a recital by the Woodwind Ensemble; and a two-day visit from Miss Maud Gatewood, associate
professor of art at the University of North Carolina extension in Charlotte.

Miss Gatewood kicked off two weeks of concentrated festivity by presenting two talks, teaching a couple of classes, and in
general submitting herself to the Davidson scene. A collection of her paintings is on exhibit in the Cunningham Fine Arts
Building.the Stowe Galleries. Tonight there will be a concert by the Male Chorus in Hodson Hall, followed by a reception
in the galleries by the light of Miss Gatewood’s exhibition. Monday night William Watkins, organist and choirmaster of the Georgetown
Presbyterian Church, will give a recital in the Davidson College Presbyterian Church. Paul Green, a Reynolds Lecturer, will speak and
present a slide program entitled “The Outdoor Drama” Tuesday. Thursday the Alard String Quartet from Pennsylvania State University will give
a concert. Friday is the last big day of the festival. The Annual Student Art Auction will be held in
the Morrison Room with Tom Covington serving as auctioneer. Student work should be turned in at the Union desk by
April 24 in order that the selection committee will have time to do its work. That night, Friday, April 28,
Fine Arts Festival history will be made with the happening that will take place on stage and in the workshop
of Hodson Hall. Precious little information seems to be forthcoming, but people are asked to wear old clothes as paint,
whipped cream, flowers, pies, and things could be flying around. But a happening is what the participants make it, and
the battle is half won when there is uninhibited participation; at least that’s what the Happening Committee is saying. Exhibitions
of painting and sculptures by students will continue through May in Hodson Hall, the foyer of Chambers, and the lobby
of the Union. Members of the Fine Arts Festival Committee are Rupert Barber, Douglass Houchens, Donald Plott, David Richey, Shaw
Smith, and James Purcell. The happening is under the direction of Rob Williams.

Clark Describes Sculpturing As A Frustrating Pleasure
By FRANKLIN ANDERSON
Asst. Managing Editor

“It’s frustrating - you can’t get it to come out - it’s just basic sin, no, incompetence,” said Dr. Tom
Clark of sculpturing. Clark, a professor of Bible and amateur sculptor who has been pursuing his hobby for 11 years,
is giving technique instruction to four students. Dave McCorkle is receiving credit, but Ross Cornwell, Tim Rothermel, and Locke Holland
became interested “from a museum-spectator standpoint,” Clark said. “They receive no credit, and I receive no pay.”

“There is a different pleasure about sculpturing,” Clark commented, “a chance to do it with your hands instead of a
brush.” A bust takes about 12 hours to complete, and in the first three only the hands are used. Usually
there are four three-hour sessions. McCorkle has been in charge of securing the models, Clark said. Models have ranged from
one of the girl cheerleaders to Herb Jackson (see picture at right) to “Bobby, who carries beer cartons for Hattie’s.”
Normally, the model sits for 15 minutes and gets a five-minute break. But, Clark said, “we require a different angle
each time, so that we can get the perspective.”

Clark characterized McCorkle as a sculptor of “real talent.” The bust of Herb Jackson is “the best thing he’s done.”
“They’re all different,” observed Clark. “I don’t tell them any special method to use. I only try to show them
the relationships of various parts of the head. Every person sees something in his own fashion. I’m not telling them
to do an abstract, or to do it rough or smooth,” he insisted.

Each model is done in clay, then baked in a kiln outside Charlotte. Busts are left on top of flower
pots in the kiln to bake. After the clay has been baked, a plaster cast is made of the head,
in two sections. The cast is then filled with plaster. When the plaster inside is dry, the cast is chipped
away to produce the finished bust. After the first sitting, a knifelike “stick” is used. The stick resembles a dinner
knife, with a spoon-shaped blade. Often, there is a wire loop on the other end for digging out clay. No
courses are offered as such in sculpturing, but credit is possible through special arrangement with the art department.
