**Rotational Recast Inspires New Hope**

So, you're all "strung out" with exams, gas pains, and the general fear of whether you'll wake up tomorrow. Don't worry! I know something that may brighten your night. The "Kid" has a solution. Watch out.

During the Second World War, a young poet from England emerged on the scene. Keith Douglas was born on January 24, 1920, and was unfortunately killed at Normandy on June 9, 1944. (His book of poems is in the library 821/D73S.)

However, in a letter to a friend, J.C. Hall, he wrote something that sums up for me a new way to view whatever it is I worry about. He said that:

"To be sentimental or emotional now is dangerous to oneself and to others. To trust anyone or to admit any hope of a better world is criminally foolish, as foolish as it is to stop working for it.

"It sounds silly to say work without hope, but it can be done; it’s only a form of insurance; it doesn’t mean work hopelessly."

Without getting too deep, maybe Mr. Douglas has more to say. If we can implement the execution of all ignorance and pardon all those who hinder our progress, maybe we'll be on the way to forming a new insurance policy. President Nixon, the fuel shortage, no T-Day vacation, war, exams, and whatever other gripe you may harbor "doesn’t mean work hopelessly." As a friend of mine once said:

"Before I could swim, I hated water! Now, I love it, I drink it, and I wash in it. Now I can use it."

**‘Ne Ultra Greenback’ Prompts Outrage, Neisler Challenges Barbecue Criticism**

To the Editor:

For those of us who have faith in the future of Davidson and other good colleges, it is reassuring to observe that student writers such as the one responsible for the "Ne Ultra Greenback" piece (February 1 DAVIDSONIAN) eventually develop some maturity and judgment and even a modicum of good taste in later years.

To the Editor:

Mr. Doug Brown, by his own assessment, is a student at a college whose administration deceives her benefactors by "glossing over" Davidson’s many faults. This is partially accomplished through the smooth-tongued wizardry of Long.

These people are not motivated by any sincere interest in Davidson. They selfishly support Davidson in order that they may have a "tax write-off," whatever that is. (It sounds very evil and dishonest).

Mr. Brown has learned nothing of economics at Davidson. (He probably questions the ideas of John Maynard Keynes).

The only glimmer of light is Davidson alumnus, Governor Holshouser, but the explanation is simple. He had the good fortune to "rise above" his Davidson background.

During the past year, it was my privilege to have significant and meaningful contact with hundreds of supporters of Davidson College. I did not find them to be shallow, selfish, or unwealthy.

Not only did they give of their money to help Davidson College (and, incidentally, also help Mr. Brown), but more importantly, they gave of their time which to most of them was a precious commodity.

To the Editor:

Last Sunday evening (February 3, 1974) Mac Legerton gave a talk on migrant workers in California. In the typical Davidson tradition, less than ten students showed up to hear of the power elite’s exploitation of the farm workers. I can only conclude that the rest of the student body was either studying, watching television, or indulging in some other socially accepted activity.

Why has this benign indifference overcome the student body? Are other universities having to cope with this mass lethargy?

Our time is highly organized by the administration: we are supposed to spend the majority of our time either studying or engaging in some form of entertainment.

In essence, we either spend our lives memorizing facts for professors or attempting to lose consciousness in an intensive escapism. Time passes, and instead of thinking, we absorb information like mindless robots. The other hours of the day are uneventful and uncreative.

In class, the Davidson student learns to absorb huge amounts of information and regurgitate it on exams. This is not education; it is a colossal failure.

Can one really blame us for being apathetic and escapist when we are socialized to a mute acceptance of free enterprise, exploitation, harmful competition, and nationalism?

It is readily apparent to most futurists that capitalism is not the answer to the future. So we read the classics and learn economics and Euclidean geometry.

No Davidson student would discuss this in his spare time because, "I have to write a paper." We try to ameliorate social inequities by carrying on one or two token activities, but we are extremely alienated because of the corporate power struggle.

The little man in our society seems to be just as dissatisfied. I daresay that the twenty million poor are a little alienated too. Is this going to be our collective future?
