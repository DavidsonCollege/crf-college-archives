Woody's Athlete Of The Week

The inaugural Woody’s Athlete of the Week is freshman basketball player Janko Narat, a 6’6" forward from Domzale, Yugoslavia. Narat averaged 16 points per game during the week, in Davidson victories against Campbell and Charleston Southern and a loss to Radford.

Monday night in Fayetteville, he scored 10 points and garnered 4 rebounds to help the ‘Cats to a 59-53 win over Campbell. Thursday night at Belk Arena he delivered a career-high 15 points and captured a team-high 8 rebounds, and was instrumental in the Wildcats' 92-78 victory. Saturday night at Radford, he upped his career-high with a 23-point effort against the Highlanders.

Now firmly installed in the starting lineup, he has proven himself able to burn opponents with penetration and with the three-pointer. His selection as WAoTW entitles Janko to a free dinner for two at Woody’s Restaurant in Cornelius.

Davidson Plunders Buccaneers

By Larry Dagenhart

Just when it seems as if the world is falling apart, we still have college basketball. Although many minds were focused on the Persian Gulf situation, the Davidson basketball team managed to pull together and knock off Charleston Southern (formerly Baptist College) 92-78 Thursday night.

Appropriately, the international contingent came through for Davidson, as the Cats got 16 points each from Detlef Musch and James Marsh, as well as a season-high 15 from Janko Narat. Also scoring well were Pat Holloway with 13 and Paul Drobnitch with a season-high eight points.

Things started slowly for Davidson, as Charleston Southern jumped out to a 7-2 lead on a steal and dunk by Anthony Houston. Fortunately, the feisty Wildcats quickly answered, and back-to-back three-pointers by Jason Zimmerman put them up 10-9. From there Davidson never looked back. The ‘Cats hit 16 of their first 24 field goal attempts, a feat accomplished through something the team has had trouble with until now—kicking the ball out to the shooters when the big men are trapped inside. “They (Musch and Marsh) didn’t think it had..."To go to the basket every time,” said coach Bob McKillop. “We were able to get some threes on some kickouts,” he added. Although the Wildcats cooled off, hitting only three of 15 over the rest of the half, they remained energized by a buzzer-beating Pat Holloway jumper, and went up 47-36 at the intermission. The 11-point halftime deficit was the closest the Buccaneers would get for the remainder of the contest. The Wildcats concentrated on running out the clock with patient offense and eventually got the win, avenging an 80-76 loss to the Bucs in Charleston on January 5. “We're better than our record demonstrates,” noted McKillop after the game. “The players are developing a sense of trust in themselves and the chemistry is developing,” he said.

First Place Radford Defeats Cats
By Bruce Balestier

Saturday evening at the Dedmon Center in Radford, Virginia, 3,900 fans were witness to a guest from another dimension; Doug Day made everything in sight, scoring 30 points, including 7 three-pointers, 4 of them during a 21-7 run that settled the outcome in Radford’s favor. Day’s hot hand, despite the fine defensive efforts of the Wildcats’ Darry Strickland, turned a 45-45 tie into a 66-52 Radford lead with 6:43 to play, and the Highlanders held on for a 78-72 win.

Radford threatened to put the game out of reach in the first five minutes of the contest, feeding off a frenzied crowd and Davidson turnovers to take a 9-0 advantage. The ‘Cats, aided by three-point baskets from Jason Zimmerman and Paul Denmond, managed to stop the bleeding, but the Highlanders continued to lead, and enjoyed a 21-12 edge with 9:05 remaining in the half. But Janko Narat proceeded to take over the game for the ‘Cats, scoring 13 points (among them 3 three-pointers) during a 5:17 span late in the half to bring his team back. Jason Zimmerman’s three free throws with :02 left cut the Radford lead to 33-31 at the intermission.

The Highlanders, helped by a pair of Davidson turnovers, threatened to pull away during the initial possessions of the second half. A three-pointer by Day gave Radford a 38-31 lead at the 18:52 mark, but the ‘Cats refused to fold. A driving layup by co-captain Darry Strickland brought Davidson within 43-41, and two free throws by J.D. Heuer tied the contest at 45-45, setting the stage for Day’s heroics. Narat continued his good play in the pivot, contributing 12 points and 9 rebounds.

A pair of major challenges lie ahead for the ‘Cats, who travel to Charlottesville, Va. to meet Virginia Monday night before returning to Belk Arena to face South Carolina Wednesday night at 7:30. They return to Big South action Saturday night at Belk Arena against the Jaguars of Augusta.

Notes:
Entering the Radford game, Jason Zimmerman was 8th in the Big South in scoring at 14.6 ppg (the leading freshman scorer in the conference), 1st in free throw percentage at 87.5% and 2nd in three-point field goal percentage at 43%. James Marsh ranks 9th in rebounding at 6.6 per game and 2nd in field goal percentage at 56.3%. Paul Denmond ranks 3rd in free throw percentage at 79% and Detlef Musch ranks fourth in blocked shots with 1.5 per game.
