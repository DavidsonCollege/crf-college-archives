For coach Bob McKillop and the rest of the men’s basketball staff, the first day of practice always seems strikingly similar to Christmas — the family is all gathered together, a host of new gifts lie in wait of opening, excitement abounds, and glad tidings fill the air.

When the Wildcats held their first practice session of the 1998-99 basketball season Oct. 17, 10 veterans and four rookies made a pledge to continue the superlative effort that in 1997-98 earned Davidson a Southern Conference championship and its first NCAA appearance in 12 years.

Among the 10 veterans is junior forward Landry Kosmalski, the conference freshman of the year in 1996-97, for whom the first day of practice couldn’t possibly have come soon enough. “The preseason is just so long, and with all the great feelings we have about this year’s team,” Kosmalski said, “we just really couldn’t wait to get out there.”

Senior forward Ben Ebong, a team captain and last year’s league tournament MVP, feels precisely the same way. “It feels good to finally get out of the preseason,” Ebong said. “Everything’s gone really well so far.”

Assistant coach Jason Zimmerman says that when players arrived in Belk Arena for the first day of practice, they may very well have been under the impression that they’d never really left Davidson’s Chambers classroom building. “The first week of practice always involves a lot of teaching,” Zimmerman said. “To keep the pace going, we make an extra special effort to incorporate activities as well.”

Coach Bob McKillop is quick to note a distinction between rookies and veterans’ experience of the first week of practice. “Veterans have the advantage of already understanding terminology and techniques,” McKillop said.

Ebong added: “Freshmen are learning a lot and trying to get up to speed, but veterans have been through this all before. We’re just trying to make sure no one misses a beat. We want to pick up right where we left off last year.”

Key to a renewal of success for the Wildcats in 1998-99 is smooth transfer of knowledge and insight from veterans to rookies. So far, according to McKillop, the process has come off without a hitch. Said McKillop: “The rookies have been extremely fortunate that the veterans are lending so much moral and technical support, walking them through things, and helping out in a number of different capacities.”

Senior captain Chadd Holmes views veterans’ support of rookies as something unquestioned. “Freshmen have no idea what to expect,” Holmes said. “We understand that. We’re there to help.”

“Even veterans have anxiety coming into the first practice, because every year it’s a new team,” Ebong said. “The dimensions have changed.”

Assistant coach Matt Matheny put it more succinctly: “You can’t help but be anxious coming in as a freshman on the first day.”

So how would rookies characterize their first week of practice? “It was probably the hardest thing basketball-wise I did in my life,” said Brian Turner, a rookie guard. “I got hit from all different angles with things to learn. I got hit by people too. It was all very intense.”

Turner cited senior leadership as a huge asset to the 1998-99 Wildcats. “The veterans have been helping me out a lot with things I don’t know,” he said. “I know I'll be adjusted. I'll be alright.”

Fellow freshman Martin Ides, a 7-foot-2, 280-pound native of the Czech Republic, said his main goal thus far at practice has been to cut down on personal mistakes. “I didn’t get yelled at as much today in practice,” he said, “so I guess I’m doing alright.”

McKillop has no unrealistic expectations for how long it will take the 1998-99 Wildcats to gel together and come into their own. “It’s a step-by-step process,” McKillop said. “Our guys are listening and learning, and I’m very impressed with the progress they’ve shown so far.”

Added Matheny: “Our goal is to get better and better each day. The freshmen have made tremendous strides already and I’d say we’re right about where we want to be going into our first scrimmage.”

THE COACH

What they are saying about McKillop:

Emil Parker, Davidson sports information director: “He's the most intense coach we've had since Lefty Driesell. He’s bringing the program back to the heights Lefty had it at. In terms of organization, he’s unsurpassed. His in-game coaching is the best I’ve ever seen. He had it clear in his mind what type of system he needed when he came here, and has done an excellent job of recruiting players for that system. That's why the program is in as good a state as it is right now.”

Judi Murphy, Research Technician, Office of Planning and Institutional Research: “Ever since he and his family first moved to Davidson, they’ve been extremely well received by the community and the campus. He’s done a lot to promote professionalism and good spirit within the basketball program. He has a true interest in each one of his players. He spends social time with them as well as court time. He’s a very good coach and a big plus to Davidson. We're all pleased that he’s here.”

John Kuykendall, President Emeritus and Professor of Religion: “He took a program which had fallen into disrepair and had both the patience and confidence to build it up again from a very low foundation. The people he’s brought here as colleagues in coaching and as student-athletes have not only contributed in one way or another to the basketball program; they've contributed to the fabric of this community. You never have to doubt Bob McKillop about the character of someone he wants to bring here to play basketball.”Very gratifying to see him having the kind of success he’s had the last two or three years. I would have to say, though, that in times when he’s been deeply disappointed, his strength of character has still shone through.” 

Bobby Vagt, President: “We are fortunate to have in Bob McKillop a coach well-schooled in the art of basketball. Bob passes on to his players a sense of responsibility, caring, and honesty. He embodies in his program that work ethic and discipline which is central to Davidson College. I find his basketball program absolutely consistent with what goes on within the school. He has a rare gift.”

Dean Jones, Director of Development: “Bob McKillop exerts a positive influence on all his players and on the campus as a whole. It’s clear that his players respect him very much. That’s particularly admirable in a day when there are so many negative reports circulating about coaches’ relationships with players. We’ve been very fortunate and pleased to have Bob here.”

Tom Shandley, Dean of Students: “Bob McKillop’s program has pulled us together as a community and generated great pride in Davidson. One looks back at the last game of last year when we played Michigan in the first round of the NCAA tournament and remembers what a time of unity and fun it was for the entire community. The success of Coach McKillop and his team enabled that.”
