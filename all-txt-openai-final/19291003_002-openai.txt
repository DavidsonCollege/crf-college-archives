**THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER 3, 1929**

**Davidson Students Indicate Choice For Large Variety of Professions**

**Excellent Tennis Squad**

**Large Number of Men Remain Undecided as to Vocations**

**MEDICINE PROVES POPULAR**

**Business, Ministry, Law, Education, Engineering, and Banking Follow in Order Named**

According to the registration sheets, Davidson students are entering into a great variety of special fields of work in the
future. Nearly every branch of industry is represented on the list. There are also a large number of students enrolled
who are undecided as to their life work. Davidson offers a fine opportunity for a strong foundation in every subject
listed.

It is interesting to note that there are more students who are undecided as to their life work than those
who signified a particular preference. Also, medicine tops the list with business coming second, and the ministry lags third. This
is the first time that business has been second choice in several years. The vocations chosen by the students are
as follows:

**Work Preferred** | **No. of Students**
--- | ---
Business | 80
Medicine | 93
Ministry | 70
Law | 63
Educational Work | 35
Engineering | 29

**Quadwrangler Club Initiates Dr. Lingle**

Thursday night, September 26, the Quadwrangler Club held a meeting and entertainment to officially welcome Dr. and Mrs. Walter L.
Lingle to Davidson College. Its purpose was also to elect Dr. Lingle into the Quadwrangler Club ranks. The meeting was
held in the beautiful new club room on the third floor of New Chambers. It was opened by the acting
president, Dr. Vowles, who welcomed the guests, including Dr. and Mrs. Lingle, and the wives of the faculty members. Music
was furnished by the Orr Brothers in a violin duet, being accompanied by Paul Frye. Next, Professor Cullum, accompanied by
Ruth Broughton, of Chicago, Ill., beautifully rendered two vocal selections.

Amid much mock solemnity, Dr. Walter L. Lingle’s name was proposed for membership. After being certain that he could perform
certain tricks and customs, he was duly elected as a member of the great and mysterious Quadwranglers. The secretary, Professor
Beaty, then read a letter said to have been received by him (probably also written by him) giving valuable information
as to the behavior of certain Davidson College professors during their summer month abroad. Refreshments were served and the meeting
was brought to a close. Professor Beaty was in charge of the refreshments; Professor Lyon, arrangements; Professor Lilley, decorations; Doctor
Vowles, program.

A minister in addressing his flock began: “As I gaze about I see before me a great many bright and
shining faces.” Just then eighty-seven powder puffs came out.

“They've taken all the brooms out of the White House.”
“Why?”
“Because they’ve installed a Hoover.”

“Papa, what do you call a man who drives a car?”
“It depends on how close he comes to.”

**Tentative Schedule Listed For Matmen**

Although the eyes of all on the hill are focused on the eleven men who are upholding Davidson College’s honor
on the gridiron, still many are looking forward to the varied interests of the winter sports season. Among the most
of this group are those who plan to center their attention on wrestling.

In preparation for the opening of the season on February 1, when N. C. State is met at Raleigh, Coach
Tex Tilson has advised afternoon workouts for those men not out for football, and soon expects to have regular practice
two nights a week. The long grind of conditioning has commenced early this year in hope that the men will
be in the pink of condition by the first meet. An unusually stiff schedule has been arranged for this season,
including Big Five meets with N. C. State, Duke, and the U. of N. C. The team journeys to West
Point where the strong Army team is met. Also, a tentative meet is being arranged with the U. of Virginia.
The following letter men will again represent Davidson College on the mat: Captain Christenberry, Brown, Brohard, Cowan, Warren, and Marrow.
Some promising sophomores, who have had previous experience at High or Prep school, are slated to appear for workouts. The
schedule to date follows:

February 1—State at Raleigh.
February 8—V. P. I. at Blacksburg.
February 12—U. N. C., here.
February 15—Dukeat Durham. February 22—Army at West Point. February 24—U. Va at Charlottesville (Tentative). Old Gold tobaccos... they do not
require "artificial treatment."

Davidson To Have Usual

With three of last year’s lettermen back in ranks and all of last year’s freshmen team also back, tennis prospects
for this season are very bright. All of the returning lettermen have improved their game during the summer and are
now practicing regularly every afternoon when the weather permits. Last year’s lettermen who returned this year are: Captain Frontis Johnson,
A. N. Halverstadt, and W. L. Poe.

All the members of last year’s freshman team who have returned are preparing to put up a fight for the
position vacated by the graduation of J. T. Roddy. E. Z. DuBose, No. 1 on the freshman team, is the
leading contender for the coveted position while the others are working hard to furnish him with plenty of opposition. Members
of the freshman team were E. Z. DuBose, S. B. McLean, G. R. Fain, and M. L. Roddey. Added to
the above mentioned are several who were on neither team last year but have good prospects in this year’s race.
A. L. DeCamp, Pettus, and several others who have tried for the team in past years are at school this
year while D. G. Calder, T. W. McLean, and others from the freshman class are also working hard for a
position.

The Davidson tennis team of last year had one of the best seasons ever recorded by a Davidson team. Thirteen
matches were played and thirteen matches were won while a total of 72 individual matches was piled up to 7
for opponents. With the material at hand, the team for this season should be able to hang up a record
quite as impressive as those of Davidson Tennis Teams of the past years.

LUTHER LITTLE TO SPEAK (Continued from page 1)

In consideration of his past lectures, it is certain that Dr. Little will have a valuable message for all college
students.

AN EARLY MATCH IS PLANNED FOR GOLFERS

Announcement was recently made by L. A. Mills, Captain of the Golf Team, that an elimination tournament would be held
at an early date to determine those men who will constitute this year’s team. The exact date has not been
definitely set. Mills and Jack Pepper, who was recently elected manager, were members of the team last season and appear
to be in good form. The loss of J. B. Hutaff will be keenly felt. Freshmen material is reported as
being plentiful but the yearling possibilities must remain doubtful to a large extent. A larger number of candidates than usual
have reported up to this time.

A tentative match is being arranged with the team of the Gastonia Country Club. This should prove an exciting contest,
as the Gaston County Club has proved its quality in previous appearances.

For the benefit of those who are not particularly interested in this game at the present time, let it be
said that it has quite a following on the campus, both by students and faculty members. Dr. W. L. Lingle,
President, endorses the game most highly and is an habitual player. Among others who have an avowed liking for the
links are Professors Brown, Fulcher, Watts, and Doctor Moffatt. Doctor Arbuckle, head of the Chemistry department and in active charge
of the course, states that the links are in the best condition they have ever been since their construction. More
improvements are planned and will be put into effect as soon as possible. Particular work and repairs have been made
on the third green. Especial attention is called to the sign on which the rules of the course are posted,
at number one tee. Everyone playing is requested to carefully read and observe these in detail.

Back Joe McCall, Half-Back

Whose eighty-five yard run for a touchdown against Clemson was a feature of the game.

When meat or fish or fowl has to be made good by artificial flavoring or sauces, let your stomach beware!
Beware, also, of tobaccos that have to rely on “artificial treatment.” OLD GOLD tobaccos are naturally good; made honey-smooth and
free of “throat scratch” by Mother Nature herself. By the violet rays of natural sunshine... not by artificial treatment. More
than three million smokers have changed to this smoother and better cigarette. No other cigarette ever won so great a
fan-family in so short a space of time. Try a package... and you'll know why. P. Lorillard Co., Est. 1760

Better tobaccos make them smoother and better... with “not a cough in a carload.”
