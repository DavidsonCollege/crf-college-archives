**Presuming honor**

When new freshmen arrive at Davidson, they are smothered with information about the Honor Code. Usually, they feel proud to be at a school where they can leave their doors unlocked and their books unguarded. They follow the Honor Code and believe everyone else does too. Davidson becomes for them a utopia where no lying, cheating, or stealing takes place.

As they grow older, they become a little nonchalant. Ask an upperclassman about what sort of crime goes on in Davidson and he’ll probably mention that a few bicycles are stolen now and again. And then he’ll quickly add that townies — not students — are the likely thieves. When one adheres to the Honor Code and never witnesses any violations, as is true for almost all students, he draws this inference: no student ever violates the Honor Code. This, unfortunately, is not true.

Two students, acting separately, both in responsible positions, stole over $3000 from a campus organization over the past year and a half. Their cases may be flukes — or they may be tips of the iceberg. In either case, the point is that honor code violations — gross honor code violations — do occur. Trusted students do not always resist temptation.

The proper response to this discovery is to minimize the temptation students face. Students who control large amounts of money — the eating house treasurers, the fraternity comptrollers, the SGA chancellor, and the business managers of other organizations — should be audited on a regular basis. Right now only a minimal amount of — if any — scrutiny is applied to these students.

We suggest that the office of student auditor be created. The auditor could be either a student who serves on a volunteer basis, like the student solicitors and defense advisors, or he could be a first-year alumnus who, like the assistant to the president, holds a full-time, salaried position with the College for one year. Of course, the student auditor would have nothing like the expertise of a CPA, but he would be performing a duty that is now completely neglected. An amateur auditor is better than no auditor at all. And one expects that a student auditor could rely on the College comptroller and business manager for assistance.

However we complete the details of the auditor’s job, we must recognize that the job must be performed if we are to ensure the proper functioning of the honor system. We can assume that most students are honorable, but we can never assume that all students are perfectly honorable. Simple obedience to the honor system is not always sufficient to uphold it. We must actively insert checks into the system when the system appears weak.

**Public scrutiny**

**Breaking through the Honor Code’s veil of secrecy**

I spent spring term away from Davidson, but still tried to keep up with campus news. I was concerned when I heard about two controversial Code of Responsibility cases, one in which a student seemed to have been punished too severely, the other in which a student seemed to have gotten off lightly. I wished that somehow I could get a first-hand look at the honor system in action, to see how fairly the system actually worked.

I wished too hard...

A week after returning to Davidson, I discovered that a student had been routinely taking money from a campus organization. Upon my confronting him, he returned the money — upwards of $800 — but maintained that he had not violated the Honor Code. Instead, he told the Dean of Students that he had merely “misused the money,” didNot want an Honor Council hearing, and was willing to accept whatever punishment the Dean deemed fair. Quite a statement... John Siman's acceptance of the sanction and repayment of the money certainly indicated his implicit confession. I heard the words “no precedent” several times during the settlement of this case. A month after my return, I discovered that a second student had stolen money from a campus organization. This student was a more ingenious thief than his counterpart, for his take — nearly $2500 — had gone undetected for many months. This case was complicated by the student’s having graduated a few weeks before the evidence was gathered against him. Ultimately, the student agreed to repay the full amount stolen, but he was not punished. The Dean did not take part in this settlement. The case was not brought before the Honor Council, for there is no easy way to make the Honor Code apply to an alumnus. Again I heard the words “no precedent” while the case was being settled.

The problem with this approach is that sooner or later students guilty of relatively minor infractions will be caught in the middle, punished too harshly by a system that was not paving to accommodate cases like theirs. Reflecting on these two cases, I concluded that the Dean had acted with good intentions, but that he did not handle the cases with the legal meticulousness one would demand from, for example, a magistrate. Let me be quick to say, however, that the fuzziness of procedure was not clearly the Dean’s fault. I had the impression that the honor system itself seemed so vague in spots as to provide no guidance for the Dean. Which brings me back to the two Code of Responsibility cases of last spring: in both cases there was no clear procedure for determining punishments for the students. And, not surprisingly, people in the community questioned the fairness of both punishments.

Now one approach to eliminating questionable punishments is to inscribe mandatory sentences for all Honor Code and Code of Responsibility violations onto stone tablets. Allow the Dean and the Honor Council no discretion in determining punishments. Treat all students exactly alike. Disregard all exceptional cases. A second approach is to allow the system to operate more or less as it does now but to make the decisions of the Dean and Honor Council part of the public record. Without compromising the privacy of accused students, the Dean and Council can announce the number of cases heard each term, the nature of the cases, the number of convictions, and the severity of the punishments. This information will allow the community to scrutinize the performance of the Dean and the Council, and thereby give them a chance to question seemingly unfair convictions and sentences. Furthermore, the Dean and Council, aware that their decisions were no longer shrouded in secrecy, would be more sensitive to how the community would regard any inconsistencies in their verdicts.

The idea here is simple: when one has to justify his decisions publicly, he often is more judicious than he would have been otherwise. I am submitting this proposal to the Student Conduct Council. I hope that the Davidsonian can begin printing the results of Honor Code and Code of Responsibility cases by the end of this term.
