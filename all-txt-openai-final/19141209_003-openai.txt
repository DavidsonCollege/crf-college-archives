TWO GOOD DEBATES SECURED.
Two debating contracts for Spring have been recently signed. Preparations will begin immediately after Christmas for the preliminaries to determine the members of the two teams which will represent Davidson. Both of the debates, the one with Clemson College, and the one with Emory College in Georgia, will be held on Easter Monday night. The Emory-Davidson debate will be staged at Agnes Scott College in Decatur, Ga. The debate with Clemson, at Winthrop, it is hoped.

Intercollegiate debating is fast assuming great prominence in the American colleges, and there has been much interest in the contests which Davidson has engaged in. Davidson has been exceptionally successful in this line. Year before last she won both debates, with Wake Forest and the University of South Carolina, by unanimous decisions. Last year the Davidson team lost to South Carolina, but won the series cup from Wake Forest. Great interest is already being shown in the coming debates, and it is to be hoped that a large number of men from both societies will enter the preliminaries. Davidson has already proposed subjects to both Clemson and Emory and answers as to the sides chosen are expected withina week. The subjects will be posted in the reference room of the library, where material for study of them will also be collected. The debate with Emory is a single debate, the one with Clemson the first of a series of three.

The game between Georgia Tech and Clemson was played before a crowd of 5,000 spectators on Grant Field, in Atlanta. More than 500 Clemson boys backed their team up and gave a fine exhibition of rooting. The final score was 20 to 6 in favor of Tech, but Clemson is not discouraged, as this is the first time in several years she has scored a touchdown against her old rival.

The Belgian counsel proposed that Virginia and Washington and Lee have a post-season game on December 5 for the Belgian Relief Fund. Dr. Smith, President of Washington and Lee, was very enthusiastic for the game and sent a message to the Virginia authorities asking them if they would play, but the request was refused on account of the Virginia team having disbanded for the season.

Virginia, Johns Hopkins, and Carolina will hold their regular triangular debate in the Spring. This is the deciding year for Carolina, as she has won two and lost two debates in the series.

The Dramatic Club of Vanderbilt presented "The College Widow," by George Ade, last Friday before an appreciative audience. Quite a prominent part was taken in the production of this play by the co-eds.

Tennessee is putting up a strong claim this year for the football championship of the South. Neither Auburn nor Tennessee has been defeated this season, but Auburn was recently held to a scoreless tie by Georgia, while Tennessee has won every game she has played this season. Auburn, however, claims that it belongs to her as her goal line has not been crossed during the entire season. There has been some talk of arranging a game between Tennessee and Auburn, but nothing has been done as yet.

Dr. Weatherford, General Secretary of the Intercollegiate Y.M.C.A. of the South, recently gave an address before the V.M.I. corps.

"Ike" Biggers ('14) is studying medicine at the University of Virginia.
