THE DAVIDSONIAN

I hope everyone had a fantastic holiday season and a memorable New Year’s. If you think back really intently, you will remember that the previous Professor X was a novelist, a worldwide web entrepreneur, an aficionado of the classics, and involved in very interesting research on the human eye. This professor was unveiled by Debbie Berry, who correctly pegged him as Dr. Elliot McGucken of the Physics department. Debbie wanted everyone to read Dr. McGucken’s book: I took her advice and purchased the book from Amazon.com. Overall review: fun allusions, interesting plot, excitement, danger, poetry, two thumbs way up.

This week kicks off the first Professor X of the new semester. For those of you coming back from lands far far away, this is how the column works: you guess who the professor is by emailing the answer in. The first person to correctly answer gets to select the professor to be discussed in next week’s column. Good Luck!

She, the second of three children, was born in a northern suburb of Chicago. Her father was a neurosurgeon and her mother was a bookkeeper until her children arrived. Her older brother, Larry, is involved in a tutoring center called the Sylvan Learning Center and is the president of a small railroad, the US Sugar Corp. Since her maiden name is Sugar, her brother seems a natural fit for his job. His business cards must be a hoot! Her younger brother, David, is a consultant for businesses’ employee benefits programs. Growing up she was a very active child.

EDITORIALS/OPINIONS

Professor “X”

She was a “Brownie,” then a girl scout; she hiked, camped, canoed, played baseball, and despite her vertically challenged stature she excelled at basketball. All through her younger academic years she was enamored with mathematics. She was a natural and loved it. By the time she was a senior in high school, she was getting more and more into math.

That same year her family invited an exchange student from Belgium to join them in their home. Eveline became what she refers to as her “Belgian sister.” They still keep in touch and recently had a visit. When it was time to go to college she jokes that she was trying to get as far away from her brother Larry as possible; since he went to Cornell, she went to Pomona in southern California. Seriously, the east coast and the Ivy League didn’t appeal to her, so she went west. The coast of sunny southern California was permeated with a laid-back mood and attitude she really grooved with.

Two courses shy of completing a major in math, she discovered that she did not enjoy all the higher abstractions and theories. So she switched and has never looked back. On a blind date as a freshman, she went on a one hundred mile drive to the San Diego Zoo. Her date was a first-year grad student at Cal Tech. Apparently, the first year there they must teach their students how to win a woman’s heart, because one year later they were engaged. She likes to joke that she met her husband in a monkey house.

Aside from seeing her fiancé in college,

she also enjoyed tutoring other students and playing bridge and intercollegiate basketball. The rules of women’s basketball have come a long way to give us the WNBA. In her college days, they played six on six, where three girls from each team stayed on one side of the court and were not allowed to cross over the half-court line. This was enforced so that the women would not overexert themselves.

After graduating from Pomona, she went straight to UCLA graduate school and continued studying. While at UCLA, she was in a serious earthquake that destroyed a VA hospital and a major overpass. The aspect of the earthquake that she found rather unexpected and frightening was the extreme loudness of the entire ordeal.

After she and her husband graduated from graduate school, they moved to Salt Lake City, where she was employed by the University of Utah. She says they laid low all winter and then exploded into the outdoors all summer. The huge university research engine never really appealed to her, so when she was offered a job here at Davidson she readily accepted and has been happy ever since. When she arrived in 1979 she...was Davidson’s first Jewish professor. If you visit her in her corner office, you can see one of her hobbies on display. She crafts rather large wall hangings with a carpet-like texture. There are two in her office; one of them is a reproduction of a famous abstract painting, and the other is a geometric pattern that is based on Native American designs. Also in her office, you will find a large purple dragon resting on the windowsill, wrapped around a model castle. She loves purple dragons. E-mail your guess to Brandt at brmcmillan@davidson.edu.

By Andrew MacDonald

It is an idyllic January morning. I awake to the sunlight streaming through the cracked shades that should have been replaced years ago. I yawn and look up at the alarm clock. Ah, a bright and early 9:35. “Aaaaah,” I thought to myself as the last remnants of my dream-state wandered away, to be lost until another night. I climb down from my bed, being careful not to step on the Dr. Perky soda I left out the night before. I yawn and stretch my arms out to the sky and meander over to the window. I crack the sordid shades open a tad and I fall flat on my ass. Rising again, I look out once more. Yes, it was not the LSD flashback I had feared. It was snow!!! I blink and rub my eyes as my hand quickly reaches for the blinds cord. I yank and before I know it, the light blinds me. It is sunlight, reflecting off of the pristine, beautiful, white snow. I am shocked, then amazed, then quizzical. Why am I sitting in my boxers when I could be outside playing in the snow? I quickly race to the closet in search of “layers” and my warm jacket, and as I try to figure out why my head would not fit through the sleeve, I turn on the computer and begin my IM assault. Within ten minutes of this idyllic January morning, I am outside hurling hastily made snowballs at everything that moves. (Luckily these moving objects are the friends who I had enticed outside to “see” the snow). Hehehehe...

The day then proceeds as normal, the occasional class, the occasional nap, the occasional nuclear holocaust (just checking to see if you were paying attention), until the afternoon. I find myself playing in the snow, once again, when I hit upon the idea of creating Davidson’s first snowman of the season. As brilliant as it was, the project was not without peril. First, there was the problem of selecting a location. The spaces of “virgin” snow are far and few between. We finally decide on a spot near the sidewalk on the way to the old well (a great place for pictures, but I would not recommend the water). Let me repeat, do not drink the water. I shall not go into why, just trust me, purple spots are not fun. With the location selected, we then proceed to construct and have finished by the early evening. I return to the site a little while later with my top hat in hand to complete the final touches on the snowman. Yes, I have a top hat, is there something wrong with that? Abraham Lincoln had a top hat and no one ever gave him crap about it. So, leave me alone! Sorry, where was I? Oh, yes. I then leave the hat and go about my evening activities.

The next day, while wandering towards the post office, I decide to check in on my snowman. He had been leveled!!! And, more importantly, the hat was gone! My hat! My top hat! Gone! Who would dare do such a thing? So, now, we reach the heart of the issue: someone stole my top hat! I want it back. Furthermore, I have lost my faith in Davidson. Who would destroy an innocent little snowman (well, not that little, after all, it took us a couple of hours) and take the poor little guy’s hat from his lifeless mound? Who would dare do such a thing? I implore all of you. Seek out this malefactor in our midst. Avenge the snowman! Do not let him be forgotten!

Note: Andrew was suffering from pneumonia and frostbite when he wrote this article. It was especially difficult since he only had 6 fingers to work with. Also, it should be noted that the “snowman incident” will not be forgotten. A reward of one million dollars (our own little version of Who Wants to Pretend Like They Will Be A Millionaire) will be given to whoever finds the top hat and then proceeds to kick Regis Philbin’s scrawny little behind.
