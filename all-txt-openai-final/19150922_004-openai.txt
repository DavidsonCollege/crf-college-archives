FINANCIAL AGENT FOR THE COLLEGE ELECTED

In order to facilitate the raising of the $30,000 balance on the $100,000 Endowment Fund, a financial agent was recently
elected. He is to be permanently employed to attend to the finances of the institution. Mr. Shive, pastor of the
Presbyterian church at Wilson, N. C., was called to this work. He has accepted and is now in the field.
His territory consists of all the states in which Davidson College has a sufficient following to warrant him success. For
several days after the opening of the session, Mr. Shive was at Davidson getting a more intimate knowledge of the
institution to aid him in his work. There is a possibility that within the near future Mr. Shive will move
his family to Davidson for permanent residence. All friends of the college will hail Mr. Shive’s acceptance of the position
with pleasure, and Davidson should consider herself fortunate in procuring such an efficient man for this work. Dr. C. M.
Richards, who received leave of absence from the local church in order to conduct this campaign during the past summer,
has resumed his pastorate, after a successful canvass.

PLANS FOR THE ANNUAL

“Quips and Cranks” has everything in its favor to make the twenty-first volume of the Davidson Annual the best yet
issued. At present the manager, L. A. Mullen, is busy selecting and appointing his staff. Before he appoints this staff
he would like to get in touch with anyone in college who has worked on an annual in any other
school or has had experience in this sort of work. Mr. Monse, of Greensboro, who did such splendid work last
year, will again have charge of all the photographic work, except the kodak pictures. An opportunity will soon be given
every man to give his order for the Annual, and the hearty support and cooperation of the student body in
contributing articles, poems, and drawings is all that is necessary to ensure the success of this year's Annual and to
keep it among the foremost of the state.

LYCEUM COURSE

The Y. M. C. A. has made a contract with the Alkahest Lyceum Bureau for a course consisting of five
numbers. If the support is such as to justify it, an extra number will be added. The Association does not
plan to make any money, but to provide wholesome entertainment at a moderate cost. Season tickets are two dollars each,
and every man who has not bought a ticket from Manager Witt should see him at No. 12 Rumple at
once. Everyone who was here year before last will remember that the lyceum numbers furnished by the Alkahest Bureau were
entirely satisfactory. The numbers which have been secured this year are first-class in every respect; and it is to be
hoped that the men will give their hearty support to the management so that this may be a successful season.

GASTON COUNTY CLUB

With ten charter members, a Gaston County Club was organized last Saturday night. Mr. F. L. Jackson, a Gaston County
man when he graduated from Davidson, briefly gave his idea of what should be the purpose of the club, and
presided until a permanent organization was effected. Officers as follows were elected: President, H. W. Ormand; vice-president, C. E. Neisler;
secretary-treasurer, F. P. Hall; historian, J. F. Huffstetler. The charter members are: C. E. and Paul Neisler, James Gill, H.
W. Ormand, J. F. Huffstetler, R. H. Ratchford, F. P. and R. D. Hall, Harvey Davenport, and F. L. Jackson.

GOLF CLUB HAS SPLENDID PLANS FOR THE YEAR

At the first regular meeting of the golf club, held Tuesday, September 7, the only official business transacted was the
election of Mr. S. T. Henderson as student treasurer of the club to succeed Mr. Nisbet. The plans for a
fall tournament among the members of the club were also brought up and discussed. As a means of increasing interest
among the members, it was decided to vary the usual order of things. Instead of having the regular tournament in
which each man plays for himself, it was decided to have a two-ball foursome tournament in which the players pair
off and play in teams of two men each.one ball. The players are to qualify as in an ordinary tournament
and the qualifying rounds are to be played during the month of September. The date of the tournament has not
been definitely decided. The purpose of such a tournament will be to increase among the players team spirit. It is
hoped that some time in the near future Davidson will send out a golf team to represent her in that
field of sport. A more immediate hope, however, is to have a match between players selected from our club and
a corresponding number from Charlotte. This match will come off immediately after the fall tournament. It was decided furthermore to
keep the club dues for students at $5.00 per annum, the fiscal year beginning September 2.
