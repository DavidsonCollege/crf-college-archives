The Lady at the Corner Drugstore -

She pulls the lever that sends the Coke
Gushing into a glass, and looks across the counter
To see if the nearby face has a story to offer.

She needs to laugh to relieve the boredom of
A 10 to 5 counter waitress.

She turns to the window to stare out onto the street,
To see if anything has changed
In the last ten minutes. But it is still full of
Empty clothes, pushing empty faces, into
Empty stores. It wouldn't take much
To relieve the boredom of
A 10 to 5 counter waitress.

And when she goes home she yanks the TV on,
To watch what she will not listen to,
And dials the friends she does not like,
Only to feel the sound of her own words.
She must not stop to think of the boredom of
A 10 to 5 counter waitress.

And where has the time gone she wonders,
“Arthur's a character. The way he carries
On and all, and it’s a shame that
The old Sears Building has to go down, and
Who would have guessed that
Jayne Miller is pregnant.” It doesn’t
Take much to relieve the boredom of
The 10 to 5 counter waitress.

Nest

Impaled
By the unsheathed
Branches
Of a sycamore,
A matted
Tangled nest
Is waking
From a three-month rest—
Shaking
Woody locks
In lightly
Scented breeze
The abode
Waits to be
Needed by
A nursing brood.
