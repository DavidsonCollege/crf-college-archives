ATC, from page 1

Young Democrats last year. This year the ATC changed its mind about the issue. “Good leadership pays off,” said Matthews. Pending passage, next year the Republicans will receive a 60 percent budget increase, from $625 to $1000. Matthews noted their impressive presentation, organized and detailed budget, and increased number of activities next year. They already received an additional $1,500 from the ATC this year to help bring conservative speaker Dinesh D’Souza a few weeks ago.

Joseph Adams ’06, President of the College Republicans, expressed appreciation for the allocation but was also hoping to get the full $2900 they had requested. “We needed every dollar because we’re more active this year,” Adams said. “Still, the College Republicans are up-and-coming and the budget reflects that.”

The ATC gave the Young Democrats $365 out of their requested $865. This allocation reflects a 42 percent budget decrease. McLean Quinn ’04, Co-President of the Young Democrats, was also disappointed with the outcome, but he still said, “[The Young Democrats’] allocations have been sufficient for providing the kinds of events and services that our organization has hoped to achieve. The fact is that our numerous activities this year have not been costly.”

Matthews also said that these allocations are not final. Organizations can request further funds from the ATC reserve later in the year. Matthews was elected in the Category II elections as Vice-Chair of ATC last year and automatically became ATC Chair this year according to SGA by-laws. The ATC consists of ten members: two elected students (Vice Chair and Chair), five students interviewed and selected by current ATC members, SGA treasurer, one faculty representative, and the Coordinator of Student Activities.

Talk on Korean nationalism to cap off year-long lecture series

Funded by the Freeman Grant, series investigates rapidly expanding role of Asia in the world

By AMANDA STEPHENS Senior Staff WriterMonday, Dr. Charles Armstrong of Columbia University delivered the final speech in a speaker series hosted by Davidson’s Asian Studies Program. His lecture centered on the historical development of Korean nationalism and was followed by a video showing of the Korean film “2009: Lost Memories.” Armstrong specializes in modern Korean, East Asian, and international studies, and has published a book called "The North Korean Revolution, 1945-1950."

In an effort to bolster Asian Studies at Davidson and to promote international awareness, the Asian Studies Program has brought a total of four speakers over the course of the year to Davidson. Of the four speakers, two have spoken on China, one on Japan, and one on Korea. Speakers have addressed such topics as nationalism, nuclear issues, Asian identity, national security, and current East Asian concerns. Following each speaker has been a film showing from the country of discussion.

Funded by the Asian Studies Program, the speaker series has been made possible by proceeds from the Freeman Grant, which was brought to Davidson by Dr. Shelly Rigger, head of the Asian Studies Program. Although Davidson currently does not have an Asian Studies major, the college does have an East Asian Studies Concentration, which is led by approximately ten professors from the language, anthropology, history, and other departments.

In particular, the speaker series has been a corollary to a class taught by Dr. Barak Kushner called Asian Nationalism and Martial Arts Films. Kushner’s class has focused on the development of the nation, culture, and state in three Asian countries: China, Japan, and Korea, both North and South. Throughout the course, the class has watched 12 movies, four from each country. The objective has been to identify popular culture within these movies and to distinguish between the different countries.

Asia is considered one of the most rapidly developing and influential regions of the world today. Japan is the world’s second-largest economy and North Korea has taken a considerably important role with respect to nuclear issues. Because the speaker series is open to the public, Dr. Kushner views the series as an “educational outreach” that has the potential to inform the community about Asia and its growing importance in the national community. Dr. Kushner is also hopeful that the speakers will offer a deeper understanding of Asian popular culture.

“2009: Lost Memories,” the film that followed Dr. Armstrong’s talk, is a science fiction movie that questions what the consequences of Japanese colonialism would have been, had it not ended in Korea. The movie was a big blockbuster hit in Korea and sheds light on contemporary Korean culture. The film also examined North-South Korean relationships and the history of Japanese colonialism.
