Engineering, math, physics, and chemistry majors with at least a 3.0 GPA, 3.3 and above preferred, and having completed one
year of calculus and one year of calculus-based physics are eligible. You need only submit a copy of your transcripts
to determine your initial eligibility. Qualifying students will then be offered a cost-free, no-obligation tour of a Navy base at
Charleston, South Carolina, including a tour of a nuclear-powered submarine and/or surface ship. We are convinced this is THE BEST
PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING OPPORTUNITY AVAILABLE TO A COLLEGE STUDENT TODAY.
