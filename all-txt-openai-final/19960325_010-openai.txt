**“Why Men Hit” searches for the source of abuse**

“Why do men hit?” Presumably, the promise of an answer to this question brought together the crowd of about 30 students, faculty, and community members which gathered in the 900 Room last Monday afternoon. The expert on hand was Lois Warren, Director of the NOVA program, which stands for “New Options For Violent Actions.” Located in Charlotte, NOVA is a counseling program for men (and recently a few women) who batter their partners. Most NOVA participants have been court-ordered to seek treatment through the 26-week program.

Warren proved to be a veritable fountain of statistics on domestic violence. Within the first minutes of her presentation, the audience was deluged with numbers. According to sobering statistics, domestic violence occurs every 18 seconds in America, and one in four female suicides is related to such violence. Audience members were visibly affected when Warren stated that “children who witness domestic violence are a thousand times more likely to abuse than those raised in nonviolent homes.”

But an answer to the question which headlined last week’s forum, “Why Men Hit,” is not as clear cut as these statistics. Domestic violence, Warren explained, is a “pattern of coercive behavior designed to control the thoughts, feelings, and actions of the victim.” Further explanation as to “Why Men Hit” is found in her general profile of a typical batterer. An abusive man measures his masculinity by his ability to control,” she said. “This is not some sort of delusion of his — it’s not just in his mind — it’s found in society’s messages which surround us.” Insecurity and poor self-image exacerbate abusive tendencies as well. Warren explained that an abusive man is “often jealous and unable to express his feelings” in ways other than anger and violence.

In addition, men typically hold an economic advantage in their relationships. They often claim greater control over the couple’s finances, leaving their partners economically dependent. A man’s greater size and strength may also contribute to violence against women. When advantages in size and strength are concerned, she said, abuse “happens because he can do it.” “The bottom line,” Warren stressed, “is that abuse is a matter of control.”

**This Week’s Women’s Month Events**

Last Friday evening, Anonymous 4, an a cappella vocal group consisting of four women, performed in Love Auditorium. The concert was the fourth of five Artist Series productions. The repertoire of Anonymous 4 consists mainly of sacred medieval chants and polyphonic works. The group was created in 1986, and have since toured throughout the world and made several critically acclaimed recordings. Friday’s concert featured sacred English music dating from the 13th to the 15th centuries. The performers sang music dealing with the Virgin Mary. More specifically, the group performed selections dealing with “Mary’s experiences at the foot of the cross.” The concert did not consist solely of music; the group also recited several selections of medieval English poetry as well. The performers pronounced the lyrics to the chants and the poetry using period pronunciations. Anonymous 4 presented the audience with a glimpse of medieval English society through their beautiful harmony.

Throughout the concert, the four women sang with beautiful precision. Their voices blended together terrifically, creating a unified and pure vocal line. When the group performed in monophony, that is when they each performed the same melody, they were in such balance with each other that they sounded as one unblemished voice. Much of the concert featured these exquisite monophonic melodies. However, the group also performed several polyphonic works where many different voices intertwined to form a continuous musical line. The different voice parts played off of each other, forming a continuous stream of sound.

The major disappointment of the concert had absolutely nothing to do with the group's virtuosic singing. The acoustics and accompanying noises of Love Auditorium proved to be a great disruption to the enjoyment of the concert. The group sang beautifully, but Love’s detrimental acoustics made sure that the music would die before the audience had the opportunity to appreciate it. At the end of the concert, the audience rewarded the hard work and talent of the four musicians with a standing ovation, thoroughly pleased with the virtuosity of the performance.

Layman’s Daughter sings like “the nice girls next door”

Jill, Laura, and Tracy are the three mid-20-year-old members of Layman’s Daughter. They looked like they played tag in the cul-de-sac together in second grade and have been friends ever since. When I first walked into the 900 Room Saturday night, I felt bad for the group. The stage was so bare. There was no one in the audience (except friends and family and six Davidson students), and they sounded like they were performing for the youth group at church.

After a song or two, I found myself paying close attention. Their music grows on you. These girls are real people. They talked to the crowd and amongst themselves and cracked jokes to the audience. I realized that they would never be successful because they were too normal. But it was refreshing to hear someone down to earth sing to you. They sang songs of grandmother, breaking up, and not being able to stand English and Psychology classes anymore. They had something to sing about and they enjoyed doing it.

Jill sang lead and played guitar while Laura and Tracy closed their eyes, swayed in time, and harmonized. Then Tracy or Laura would take a turn at lead vocals. At times, they mouthed words as the other sang. All of their songs were close to home. Their style was minimalist folk, relying on only a few instruments the entire show. They had two acoustic guitars, which Jill and Tracy played, a tambourine, and one of those shaker instruments used in Salt-n-Pepa’s “Push It.” And they did their best with what they had — Tracy slapped her guitar as if it was a drum set.

This was a family event. I think one of their moms was in the audience as well as a boyfriend, sister, and friends. They took pictures, smiled, laughed, tapped their feet, and slapped their thighs. The band gave them much to be proud of. At times, their voices were very nice, conjuring thoughts of folk legends The Indigo Girls. They had fun. One could tell that their music was often therapy for themselves. It was heartwarming to see the enthusiastic Jill sing. Laura and Tracy really felt what they performed. I am glad I went.
