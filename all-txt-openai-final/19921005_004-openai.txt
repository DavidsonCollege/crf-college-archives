Davidson Day Care

The Day Care Center, located on Gamble Road next to the Ada Jenkins Center, provides quality day care to local children from various backgrounds and income levels. The fee is based on the ability of a family to pay; therefore, there is a special mixture of 2-4 year olds learning and interacting together. The Center is fully staffed with qualified employees who plan parties and daily activities for the children. Davidson students, who volunteer as many hours as they choose, help by spending one-on-one time and giving extra attention to the kids. It is always an exciting experience! We would love for you to volunteer. If you are interested, please call Jennifer McCraw (-646) or Angela Capillary (-6538).

NOTE: THERE WAS A MISTAKE IN THE REACH OUT ARTICLE IN THE LAST DAVIDSONIAN. THE COORDINATORS FOR THE CAROLINAS MEDICAL CENTER CHILDREN PROGRAM ARE FELMLEE AND LISA LYONS.

Russian Foreign Ministry Official to Speak at Davidson

Courtesy of College Relations

Sergei V. Lavrov, the deputy foreign minister of the Russian Federation, will speak at Davidson College on Tuesday evening, October 6. His address on “Russian Foreign Policy in a Changing World” is free and open to the public beginning at 8:00 pm in the Davidson College Art Gallery in Chambers Building. It is sponsored by Davidson’s Dean Rusk Program in International Relations.

Lavrov, a career diplomat, has been in his current Russian government post since April. He is in charge of departments and bureaus of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs dealing with United Nations foreign policy planning, human rights, and international economic cooperation. Born in 1950, Lavrov graduated from the Moscow State Institute for International Relations and has worked for Soviet missions in Sri Lanka and for the United Nations. In 1990 he was appointed director of the department of international organizations in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, then was promoted to deputy minister for Foreign Affairs in April. For more information on this presentation, call the College Union at 892-2140 or the Dean Rusk Program in International Studies at 892-2440.

A party stigma attached and they usually hold the parties at their houses, they receive the brunt of criticism for the alcohol abuses of the past years and for the reactions to new rules and regulations. The students, and especially the social organizations of Patterson Court (including women’s houses), prove themselves unwilling to change for the betterment of the entire community, clinging instead to memories of wild, free keg parties and searching out ways to recreate last year off-campus. They can or will not move to creative party themes that rest on something other than just alcohol, cheesy period music, or what have you. If they did...so now it might ward off the great reproaches of the likes of 1971. Yet, we may well accuse the administration and faculty for their continued shortcomings as well. As during the sixties, our College simply heaps continued rules and regulations, but somehow forgets the incentives and rewards for better and more responsible behavior. No trophy awaits a Court house for community service or high scholarship, nor recognition for responsible-risk-management, creative alcohol-free events, or alcohol education. Even the man placed to help Patterson Court develop the very pro-active programming that may well save it, Kurt Holmes, remains so mired in the tangled alcohol policy enforcement controversies that he has no time to think about anything else. For absolutely too long Patterson Court had the freedom to choose its course, and it chose irresponsibility; yet those who point out this fact forget that the College never gave them the incentive or direction to choose anything else. By looking back upon the trying circumstances of our past, we of Davidson College may find similarities to our current problems, if not the very causes of those problems. In both the ‘self-selection’ controversies and the alcohol policy unrest we saw reactionary students and fraternities, and the unwillingness of the Davidson powers-that-be to give them positive incentives or rewards for proactively rather than reactively dealing with the situations. History, by allowing us the full view of past circumstances, reactions, and results, allows us to examine the mistakes of the past, and gives us the chance to avoid those self-same errors. If the fraternities wish to preserve their institutions, they will well take heed and examine other Greek campuses and the advice of their nationals to find new ideas and focuses. Likewise, if the administration wishes to save itself a lot of grief and another failed policy like self-selection, it will try a different method for inducing change. If neither wishes to do so, then they should again look back on history to foresee the next twenty years of controversy and wasted energy. You’ll notice that fraternities now issue bids, allowed officially since the mid-eighties, and that all of the co-ed eating houses arising from self-selection have died out, and even the women’s houses periodically fold. Remember: if not heeded, our past will prove to be the window to our future.
