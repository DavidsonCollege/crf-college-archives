He has been a frequent speaker at the Massanetta Springs Conference Grounds during the past few years and is well known among young people. Two SERVICES DAILY Political Issues Will Be Debated From Trenches Of Literary Halls An old-fashioned brass band, blood-and-thunder political rally will be sponsored by Philanthropic and Eumenean Literary societies on Tuesday night, October 29. Aspiring orators will stand on the porches of the two society halls while the student body will stand in the roadway between and respond as the occasion demands. Two speakers each will represent the two major parties, and there is a possibility of a third party orator. No holds will be barred, and hecklers will be welcomed. Tentative plans call for a torchlight parade, placards, vote-swingers, and blaring numbers from the brass band between speeches. Tryouts This Week Both societies are joining in sponsoring this revival of the ancient hall-to-hall debating custom. Headed by Paul Crane and John Moore respectively, Phi and Eu are holding tryouts this week to select outstanding orators. Setting the date on the Tuesday before election day, the societies will meet October 22 and 29, and the Forensic Council, ordinarily scheduled to alternate with the societies, will meet November 5 and 12.

Fall Dances Will Feature Remodeled Hotel Ballroom Each Guest Band Will Give An Exhibition Before Sewanee Game Room Will Give New Setting For Dance Set Davidson's annual Homecoming will draw some 15 to 20 bands to the campus for the Sewanee game this Saturday. According to Hector MacLean, director of music, a band festival will be held in the stadium at 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon. Each band will be given six minutes during which it can march, play, and execute any maneuvers it desires. The program will begin when the bands assemble at 4 o'clock. They will march in procession to the stadium, where the program described above will take place. The climax of the program will be the playing of "DeMolay Commandery March." During the game, the bands will sit together and play during time-outs. At the half, the Davidson band will put on a special exhibition for the benefit of the visiting musicians and spectators at the game. The Hotel Charlotte ballroom is going to make the Homecoming set of dances one of the best yet. This ballroom has been completely remodeled and reconditioned. The Hotel Charlotte ballroom is air-conditioned, so whether the weekend is hot or cold, it will be perfectly comfortable. A new, modern lighting system has been installed and will greatly facilitate hearing the orchestras effectively. The new lighting system and new decorations will make the ballroom one of the most beautiful and best equipped in the South. The ballroom floor has the capacity for accommodating 300 dancers. Letters concerning the band day were sent out this week. Fifteen bands have already responded. The Fall and Spring Services have become one of the traditions of Davidson, and each year outstanding ministers of the church are brought to the campus. Last year Rev. S. S. Wiley of Thomasville, N. C., was the speaker for the Fall Services.

Another feature of the program will be a group of selections rendered by Miss Grace Robinson, director of voice at Queens, and prominent in Charlotte musical circles. Many of this year’s concerts will be held in Shearer Hall, Director James Christian Pfohl stated. The large old auditorium is enough to accommodate average audiences and its smaller size makes hearing easier.

BOB GARVEY - The art of studying is acquired over a period of time and consists more of the art to rid oneself of outside influences rather than learning facts. To prove this fact, I must go into the details of the night before four straight classes. The first detail is answering "come in" to a timid knock that enters the student into a new period, that seems to be an inevitable part of every night. In chapel, the student body hears disturbances on our campus. 

The bull session. In this case, it might be a fellow that has the same class for the morrow and is seeking the assignment or might even be seeking more fertile ground. Although the crowd is constantly leaving (against gentlemanly protest), it never grows any smaller since the overflow from other sessions is finding its way to the room where it is quite evident (from the noise) that a session is on. 

Despite the failure of freshmen to report the painter of the tank, officers of the court are still determined to find and punish the actual culprit. Clues now in possession of the judges lead some to believe that a confession will be obtained in the near future. 

The final month before the election has rolled around. The student body decides to make a choice between Willkie vs. Roosevelt.
