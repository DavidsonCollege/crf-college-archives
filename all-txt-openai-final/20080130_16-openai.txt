After last week’s tough defeat in its season opener against NC State, the men’s tennis team showed perseverance against USC Upstate on Sunday. Despite losing the doubles point to kick off the match, Davidson rallied to win the match 4-3 and improve to 1-1 on the season, while the Spartans declined to 0-1.

After losing the doubles point 1-2 and trailing the match 0-2 in team points, Davidson’s Scott Myers ’09 turned the tide with a No. 6 singles win, beating his opponent 6-3, 7-5 in straight sets. Shortly after this win, Sam Burns ’10 lost in a long No. 5 singles match 7-5, 4-6, and 3-6 to put Davidson at a greater disadvantage. The pressure increased as Davidson trailed 3-1 and USC Upstate only needed one more singles win to clinch the match; however, Walker Lyons ’11 and Ethan Jaffee ’09 met the challenge. Lyons fought for his first-ever collegiate singles victory in No. 4 singles, winning his match in three sets by the score 6-4, 3-6, and 7-5. Meanwhile, Jaffee won his No. 2 singles match in straight sets by a score of 6-2, 7-6. With the score now tied at 3-3, Davidson’s No. 1 singles player, Flaviu Simihaian ’08, needed to win to secure a victory for Davidson. Even though Simihaian lost the first set 4-6, he came back and won the match 4-6, 6-3, and 6-3.

“This win was definitely a great step in the right direction,” assistant coach Benjamin Johnson said. “After dropping the doubles point, the team really came through big with great efforts by Scott Myers and Walker Lyons.” Davidson’s next match is at home against Longwood on Saturday at 3 p.m.

Davidson women’s tennis opened the season at home on a high note when they defeated the Winthrop Eagles 5-2 on Thursday. Starting things off with a bang, Davidson won two out of three doubles matches to win the first team point. The team continued its solid play by winning four out of their six singles matches in the afternoon. Alison Rauh ’11, Teresa Wang ’10, and Virginia Berry ’10 finished off their opponents in straight sets. In her singles debut, Rauh earned her first collegiate singles match with a score of 6-3, 6-2 in No. 5 singles. Kim Whelan ’08 won in three sets in a close match by the score of 6-3, 6-7, and 6-0.

On Friday, the team showed some fatigue, falling to No. 40 NC State in its second straight day of play. Davidson lost in a 7-0 decision, making their record 1-1 for the season and improving NC State’s record to 2-0. Despite this loss, the tandem of Alison Rauh ’11 and Kim Whelan ’08 scored an impressive doubles win by the score of 8-6 in No. 3 doubles.

To finish off its last of three consecutive games, the women’s team blanked Gardner-Webb on Saturday afternoon by the score of 7-0. Davidson’s record improved to 2-1 on the season while Gardner-Webb opened the season with a loss putting them at 0-1. To kick things off, Alison Rauh ’11 and Kim Whelan ’08 won their third straight doubles match of the season and secured their first-ever No. 1 doubles victory with a winning score of 8-4. After securing their first doubles victory together this year, Meredith Skeeters ’08 and Lora Dushanova ’09 both registered their first singles wins of the season when they won in straight sets at the No. 6 and No. 5 singles spots, respectively. Michele Fanney ’10 scored an impressive win at No. 1 singles in straight sets, winning 6-4 and 6-2. Whelan, Rauh, and Wang all earned their second singles win of the season leading Davidson to the shut-out. The women’s team will look to carry momentum into its next match at home on Thursday at 3 p.m. against USC Upstate.

On Tuesday against the Paladins, Robinson matched her Saturday performance with 16 points and added 10 rebounds for her second straight double-double. Ashley Lax '11 and Danielle Hemerka '08 joined Robinson in double figures. Lax scored 11 points on 5-7 shooting from the field while Hemerka scored 10 points with a 4-6 mark from the field. Davidson started the game with back-to-back three-pointers by Housley and Katie Hamilton '08, but Furman quickly answered with a 16-2 run that forced the ’Cats to regroup. The Wildcats responded when Julia Paquette '10 converted on a three-point play and a layup to bring Davidson within three, and Thompson drained a shot from behind the arc to tie the score at 16-16 with 8:16 to play. The ’Cats finally took the lead at the 7:06 mark and augmented their advantage to 37-27 by halftime. Furman rallied at the top of the second half by cutting the deficit to 50-47 at the 9:52 mark. However, the combination of Lax, Housley, Hemerka, and Robinson closed the game strong to secure the 15-point victory. Davidson won the battle on the boards 39-24 while holding Furman to 39% from the field. The ’Cats bench also out-produced the Paladins 27-15. The victory marks the ninth win for the Wildcats in the last 10 meetings against the Paladins and extends Davidson’s winning streak to five games. The Wildcats will travel to Western Carolina on Feb. 2 for the second time this year. Davidson will look to avenge a 71-67 early season loss to the Catamounts. This ushers in a stretch of conference meetings that will pit the Cats against each of their conference opponents for the second time. Hopefully, their winning streak will carry them far.
