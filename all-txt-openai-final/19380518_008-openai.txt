Council Is To Direct Groups

The three religious organizations on the campus will be co-ordinated next year by a council of nine men that will
direct their activities. The Ministerial Band, the Student Volunteers, and the Young Peoples’ group will each elect three members to
serve on the council. It will meet occasionally to plan the work of the groups.

Thursday, May 19
“FOUR MEN AND A PRAYER”
Loretta Young, David Niven, Richard Green, George Sanders, and William Henry.

Friday-Saturday, May 20-21
“IN OLD CHICAGO” — Tyrone Power, Alice Faye, Don Ameche, and Alice Brady. A swell show.

Monday, May 23
“COCOANUT GROVE” — Fred MacMurray and Harriet Hilliard. It’s a nice story revolving around the Cocoanut Grove in Los Angeles,
a famous gathering place for stars. Fred MacMurray plays a bandman, leading an orchestra in his role of entertainer, romancing
Harriet Hilliard, who sings popular lyrics for the customers. Harriet was formerly the torch singer for Ozzie Nelson's band and
Fred with the College Collegians before crashing the movies.

Tues.-Wed. May 23-24
“ROBIN HOOD” — Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, Ian Hunter, Claude Rains, and Basil Rathbone. This movie hits top rating
as a thrill picture in Technicolor. It puts Errol Flynn in a beautiful setting with intense enough action to keep
the audience thrilled.

BROWN WINS

Heated matches and regular comedies. Errol Flynn is a beautiful mailman. The post office is congratulating the Class of 1938.

SMITH SETS ALUMNI DAY
(Continued from Page 1)
June 4th, at 8 o'clock. Davidson College, Mr. Hengeveld, Dr. Hood, Maj. Ballard, Maj. Steele, and Col. Rhett. Honor and
credit are due them for their diligent work which has gained them these positions.

Worse than not having the time to do all the necessary work, some must suffer. This is not at all
necessary in the light of leadership material among us. There are enough good men here capable of handling all these
positions.

Military Men Have Banquet
Wednesday night, May 11, Scabbard and Blade held its annual banquet in the banquet hall of Chambers Building. Besides the
official members of Scabbard and Blade, several honorary members were present. Col. Weeks, who was guest speaker, was unable to
attend. Other honorary members who were present were: Col. Rhett, Maj. Ballard, Maj. Steele, and Col. Weeks.

The largest R. O. T. C. unit in the U. S. is at Ohio State University. It forms a company
front over a half mile long.attend were Dr. Arbuckle, Dr. Lyons, Prof. Fleagle, Mr. Jackson, Capt. T. R. Aaron of
Oak Ridge, and C. C. Quick of the Eo.

After the banquet proper was a speech by Col. Weeks and the presentation of a silver roast platter. M. L.
Lafferty, retiring captain of Scabbard and Blade, and C. W. Coghill, captain-elect, made brief talks. Also, there were humorous extemporaneous
speeches by Mr. Hengeveld, Maj. Steele, and Dr. Weeks.

These men represent leaders in widely diversified fields and much responsibility on their shoulders already. This is true not only
of leadership in the honorary fraternities but in all phases of campus leadership. Because the leaders do not have all
their activities, they can perform their functions well, if only given the chance.

Too much advice from the outside is like back-seat driving. A few well-earned compliments are the spice of life.
