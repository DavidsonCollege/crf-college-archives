My Grandparents —

They died last winter. April Fools

There wasn’t even any snow.

Only lonely trees broken by ice

And quiet pools of sorrow frozen on the cracked sidewalks.

They’d had a good life.

That’s what the neighbors said.

Yet, I wonder

Did they ever glimpse Death

Behind the corner cupboard

Peering down from the grandfather clock

Whose ever-circling hands

Made no difference in their lives.

I remember them

Sitting on their musty sofa

Motionless, gazing unseeing

Across the room.

Or standing on the steps

Smiling uncertainly into the camera’s eye

Blinking in the relentless light of day.

They were old, so very old

My Grandfather and Grandmother

Their world of Sunday lunches

And green wicker chairs

Has faded.

No longer do we sit at dusk

My grandparents and I

And listen to the crickets.

April Fools

We’ve stocked up the liberty storehouses

With tinpanalleian cries

Of mouldering applepie and the girl next door

Who was mugged last week—

Said she always wanted a professional facelift—no tip.

Now we toss out freshbaked fortunecookies—

Here’s a nice thought for the grovelling masses:

givemelibertyorgivemedeath.

Unfortunately,

We cookieeaters are gagging evernow

On the bitteratmonddough

Of these our freshbaked fortunate cookies;

We cookieeaters are drowning evernow

In STPed blood,

Now settling in our sluggish lungs.

And, behold, we have a Jerry in our midst!

To bring tidings of great joy—

He who had ears, let him listen again:

Under shady trees;

This is the way Amerika ends

This is the way Amerika ends

This is the way Amerika ends

Not with A-crime

But a whim(per se).
