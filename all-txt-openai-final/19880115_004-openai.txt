**De Niro in The Mission: See it and be stunned**

By JOHN HARRIS

One of the more difficult parts about writing this review of Roland Joffe’s *The Mission* for the Davidsonian was choosing
whether to be serious in tone or merely half-serious. The last time I tried to write a serious piece of
prose at this college I was accused (and quite justly, I might add) of “try[ing] to wrap thick and impenetrable
language around no substance and pass[ing] it off as thinking” (Dr. Cynthia Lewis, Fall Term ’87). By that token alone
I think the choice of tone has already been made.

Those of you reading this review for the sole purpose of discovering the “bare hooters” quota will be dealt with
now. There are upwards of 35 of them, though only four belong to females over the age of nine. That
fact in itself will probably prompt three or four of you sickos to see this film at least twice, and
I hope I’m not there when you do.

On a more serious (not to mention more relevant) note, *The Mission*, in a nutshell, involves the story of the
struggle of mid-eighteenth century Jesuit priests to retain their South American missions. That doesn’t sound so hard except that the
Portuguese monarch isn’t exactly a big fan of God or the Church, and he feels that a South American native-turned-Christian
is simply a waste of a potential slave. What a meanie. Of course, the plot, themes, and religious symbolism go
much deeper, but to divulge much more would detract from the joy of plot discovery for the individual viewer (Translation:
I have to rush this review to meet a deadline and I don’t have the time to wax philosophical here).

One particular scene I wish to point out, however, is in the picture’s first ten minutes when Jeremy Irons as
Father Gabriel ascends the jungle cliffs at the waterfall. As the torrents of water came thrashing down upon him and
made difficult his climb, it struck me as a sort of baptism to what lay ahead. All right, it’s a
stretch, but let me know if you agree after seeing it.

Rising above an already stunning motion picture are the performances by Irons and the always-incredible Robert De Niro as the
mercenary-turned-Jesuit-priest-turned-mercenary Rodrigo Mendoza. Supporting roles by Aidan Quinn (*Reckless*) and Cherie Lunghi (*Excalibur*) help to round out the flawlessly cast
film. The real kudos, however, go to Director of Photography Chris Menges for his exceptional work in capturing the luscious
green jungles of South America, especially the waterfall scenes. This is without a doubt one of the more beautifully photographed
movies in many years.

*The Mission* does not progress particularly quickly in its over two-hour run, but it also never drags. Not one shot
is wasted. The gifted Joffe brilliantly manipulates the viewers' compassion for the characters and their cause by presenting some of
the battle scenes at the movie’s climax intertwined with reaction shots of the native children who are saddened, frightened, and
confused by the horrors going on around them.

*The Mission* is rich in religious symbolism and Church vs. State politics, and the true appeal of the film lies
in its tour-de-force performances by Irons and De Niro and the stunning cinematography. But more powerfully, the film moves you.
As a friend and I discussed as we left the film Wednesday night, there is absolutely nothing wrong with this
movie. It’s as close to perfection as you'll ever see.

**Spoof O’ the Week**

**On the fine art of correspondence**

By BILL SCOUTEN

I’ve noticed that one of the most widespread problems faced by young and old alike is the simple process of
letter writing. In fact, letter writing is such a complex project that the once-prized art of letter writing has been
reduced to a dismally mundane form of communication. At one time Edward Everett could sit at his table with quill
pen in hand and write: “When I contemplate the extent to which the moral sentiments, the intelligence, the affections of
so many millions of people, — sealed up by a sacred charm within the cover of a letter, — daily
circulate through the country, I am compelled to regard the post-office, next to Christianity, as the right arm of our
modern civilization.” (*Mount Vernon Papers, No. 27*)

One would think that letters serve as an outlet for the emotions, the ideas, and concepts which are just easier
to put down on paper. Take, for example, the “Luv” letter. “I don’t exactly know why it is so hard
for me to write to you.... Perhaps it’s my fear of not being able to write what I feel —
yes, that’s it. But, tonight the thought of you was too overpowering to block out....” Don’t you just hate letters
like this? Sentimentality and overbearing superfluity — what a cop-out?! Why not just write: “I really don’t know what I
feel about you; but, I’m sure it’s not hate.” or “I’ve not written you before, because I was just too
scared of being rejected.”

It seems to me that letter writing today has become not a slate of truth, but a workshop for needless
euphemisms, extravagant cover-ups, and utter lies. The “Dear John/Jane” letter serves as another fine example. Upon receiving a letter of
this type, you’re confronted by a boy/girlfriend who writes, saying: “I think it’s time I admitted it. My conscience is
just burning within me. I have another girlfriend, and she’s pregnant.” or “You're a great guy, but I'm engaged.” What
can you do? Is it true? The spoof staff studied this calamity in depth and found that at least 50%
of the recipients of “Dear John/Jane” letters in fact found out at a later date that the letter was a
pure lie, simply a ploy to end a relationship.

What is letter writing in the 80’s? Letter writing is no longer a creative art for philosophy and ideas but
has evolved into an...Art of deception. Letters are simply fine-tuned instruments of illusion. “My eyes are just about to close,”
she writes. Come on! Who’s she trying to fool? Since when do Davidson students write letters at two o’clock in
the morning? She is most probably just about to go down to the court for a late-night party—they’re just about
cranking now. But wait, there’s more. Another deceptive ending: “Well, I need to go and finish my homework.” Again, after
exhausting research, this fragment was labeled as a “form letter” characteristic. It’s simply a way of saying “I have nothing
else to write about.”

The idea of “form letter” characteristics brings up another very irritating fact about letter writing. Although once a medium for
creativity, philosophy, and ideas, the letter has become a stage for mediocrity of the mind and expansion of the ego.
You know when you read a letter, and it begins: “Just wanted to drop you a line and let you
know I’m still alive and that I’ve been thinking about you” or “For a while, I thought that you may
have died... and, if you did, I am now assured of life after death and/or resurrection of the body” that
a chronological account of the writer’s past will be included. Who cares about yesterday’s dinner and this morning’s shower? What’s
the point?! Chronological filing of one’s past is simply a filler of space. Faced by a clean sheet of stationery,
the writer sits and stares blankly. “What should I write?” The paper doesn’t move... neither does the pen. The condition:
writer’s block. Solution: forget the letter; it’s a lost cause. But, no! The writer, instead, begins with a chronological listing
of the last two weeks of his life. Does anyone really care about last Saturday? “Did you have a good
weekend? I spent mine sterilizing nail clippers and watching lint grow on my rug.” What’s the point of telling your
friend about sterilizing nail clippers? This is simply the result of little or nothing to say. And, who sterilizes nail
clippers anyway?!

Then, he might drop in a bit about school. “Well, it’s good to be back home.” What do you mean?
What a joke! Who are you trying to kid?! After all the complaints about the short Christmas break, you’re really
not that enthused about being back in school... it’s simply a filler. A much clearer example of such “filling” and
deceptive character reads: “As usual, school is intellectually stimulating, and I’m always studying. I will be the next Einstein.” The
previous example reveals just how the writer deceives his reader into believing that he is really studying and having a
great time while at college: “Things are great here; classes are cooking; and I’m having lots of fun.”

The final element of the “form” letter style of the day is the rather healthy “ego section.” Following the small
talk of the day, the writer simply flies, headfirst, into a pile of his own laurels. “You know that paper
I shoveled out on Sunday night, well I got a B+ on it! What a joke!”, or the ultimate boast,
“I’m in love!” Thus, the letter of the 80s is made up of four elements: a chronological listing of the
past two weeks of the writer’s life, a bit about school, a section including small talk of the day (“Did
you hear about Robbie? It must be true because I heard it from Mary in Washington and Jackie in Utah!”),
followed by a healthy portion of “ego” material. Indeed, the letter is no longer a creative, conceptual communique, but has
assumed a “form” type. And, in its place: the telephone. Alex Bell has replaced good old Ben Franklin. The fiber
optical tangle branching and stretching as a web from Kalamazoo, Michigan to Bangladesh, India with its mercurial character has replaced
the age-old practice of letter writing. Why write letters? They’re obsolete! Once it was said “Blessed be letters—they are the
monitors, they are also the comforters, and they are the only true heart-talkers.” But, that was then. This is now.
“Let your fingers do the walking”... You can even charge it to your calling card. Does the P.O. accept Visa
or Mastercard?

A look at depression

Dear Confidential Health,

This generally seems like a happy time of the year, but I feel lousy. I’m having trouble sleeping at night
and I don’t always make it to class in the morning. I used to enjoy eating, but lately I’m not
hungry anymore. I was feeling so bad that I even went to the doctor, but all of the tests determined
that there was nothing wrong. I feel like there is something really wrong with me, but I don’t know what
it is.

--A Frustrated Freshman

Dear Freshman,

Your symptoms are certainly very real, and they may be signs of depression. Sleep disturbances and changes in appetite are
common. Other symptoms you may have experienced include feelings of sadness, episodes of frustration and crying, an inability to concentrate,
lack of energy, and a generally low attitude where everything looks rotten. Some people get into a manic state of
rushing around and this may be warding off depression. There are clinically many types of depression, and it can sometimes
run in families.

It can be difficult to put feelings of depression into perspective. For a lot of students, college life itself is
their greatest stressor, whether positively or negatively. It may be the first time you are truly on your own, away
from home. There is generally a...
