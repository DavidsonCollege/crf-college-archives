Doctor Harding Speaks Before Southern Classical Conference

Dr. R. C. Harding, professor of Greek at Davidson, recently attended a meeting of the Southern Section of the Classical Association of the Middle West and South, at Knoxville, Tenn. Dr. Harding reports a very interesting and full program. Especially striking was the address delivered by Prof. Charles Knapp, of Columbia University, on “Cicero and Liberal Studies.” Professor Knapp is the editor of the Classical Weekly and one of the foremost scholars of the country. The Association is headed by Dr. Hubert McNeill Poteat, of Wake Forest College. The Southern Section is making plans to form a separate association as it is too far, when combined with the middle west, for the members to travel. A paper on “The Importance of Syntax” was read before the Association by Dr. Harding. Many other interesting papers were read by the leading Greek and Latin scholars of the South. Dr. Harding is one of the leading Greek scholars of the country, having spent last summer in Greece and Asia Minor studying Grecian customs and language. During the past winter he has been writing a weekly syndicated article for the Charlotte Observer dealing with his travels in Greece. Dr. Harding has an enviable record as a Greek professor at Davidson, having served here continuously for more than 35 years.

Beavers Elect Ten From Fresh Class

On last Monday night the members of the Beaver Club, Sophomore honor organization, were elected by the Omicron Delta Kappa Fraternity, for the coming year. The 10 members of the class of '29 chosen were: W. L. Dumas, J. R. Covington, W. P. Green, J. B. Moriarty, N. Myers, C. R. Lake, R. C. Grady, R. R. Kane, W. K. Pritchett, and W. M. Regen. The Beaver Club was organized last fall by the Omicron Delta Kappa Society. Among its main purposes is to entertain the various organizations from other institutions, such as the football, baseball, debating, or basketball teams. It also plans to make visiting high school teams, often spending some time on the hill, feel at home, and to promote, in general, a spirit of hospitality on the Davidson campus. The club's friendliness and hospitality during the last year have been spoken of in the most laudable terms. The club’s membership is composed of 10 Sophomores. In the spring the club nominates a list of rising Sophs and from this number, with few exceptions, the Omicron Delta Kappa Fraternity elects 10 for the coming year. No Freshman is eligible who is on the squad of more than one major sport, since he would be handicapped in aiding the entertainment of visitors and for certain other reasons. Both honor and responsibility rest upon those elected. The present members of the Beaver Club are: C. G. Davidson, C. R. Rowe, W. L. Lingle, L. McLain, R. A. Miller, Val Guthery, R. A. Carr, J. S. Foster, and H. R. Arbuckle.

Various visiting teams have spoken of the club's friendliness and hospitality during the last year in the most laudable terms.

DAVIDSON DEFEATED (Continued from page 1)

After the debate, the guests were entertained at a banquet by the Forensic Council at the Y.M.C.A. The two teams had a very enjoyable feast. This same question will be debated by a Davidson team composed of Harlee Branch and Don Wharton, with Sewanee on April 30th.

TEN MEN GET BIDS (Continued from page 1)

The club will not be very much larger than formerly. The new members will be initiated sometime during next week. They will be required to wear newspaper caps and pull some “shine” in addition to the regular initiation. The freshmen track artists had an easy day Saturday in running away with Catawba College 88 to 20. The Salisbury boys are experiencing their first year as a track team, but in spite of this showed that with training a goodly number of stars could be developed. Next year’s Soph president flashed real class in winning the 220, 440, and broad jump and placing second to Flynn in the century. Flynn came in first in the 120-yard low hurdles and second in the broad jump and 440.

— Literary Societies —

Metrophilian
At a recent meeting of the Metrophilian Literary Society, elections of officers for the coming year were held. These men will be installed at the next regular meeting of the society and will continue to serve in these various capacities until another election late in the fall of the next year. W. T. Covington was elected president of the society for the coming year, after several ballots had been run off. Other men nominated for this position were Wharton, Sims, and Stewart. Camper O'Neal was elected for the position of vice-president in the race against Henry Powell. For secretary, Myers, Gilmour, Smith, and Grady were nominated. The final ballot was run over between Gilmour and Smith, with Gilmour being elected. Henry Powell was chosen treasurer in the election, being run a close race by Bradford. Don Stewart was chosen for first critic and Boyce Martin for second critic, and after this, Sam Smith and Nelson were elected first and second supervisors, respectively. After the elections and general business was finished, a feed was given for all the members of the society. This being the annual spring feed of the society, a number of members were present.

Eumanean
Due to the picture which was shown at the gym last Thursday night, the Eumanean Literary Society suffered a great drop in attendance. The meeting was called to order by the president, and, after the reading of the Scripture, the house was led in prayer by R. A. Miller. In the absence of the secretary, R. A. Miller was appointed to fill the vacancy. The roll was called and the minutes were read. Since none of the members who were to take part in the debate were present, that part of the program was omitted. E. H. Smith gave a declamation, and A. C. Kelly read a short story. The critic, C. F. Smith, gave a very favorable report on these men and recommended both of them for credits. Since there was no further business to come, the meeting was adjourned.

AUSTIN ANNOUNCES
(Continued from page 1)
About twenty-five names were submitted. The final vote, the name of The Chameleon was chosen. The Sigma Upsilon fraternity is in charge of the publication of the final issue of the magazine this year. There is no designated staff for this last issue, but the work will be divided among the members of this fraternity. Quite a number of changes have been made and the magazine will be of marked literary value. The publication will be about 40 or 48 pages this issue. The department of “Cap and Bells” has been discontinued and humorous and satirical essays and stories will be substituted. All the material has been collected and is now in the hands of the printers. It will probably appear sometime about the first of May or at least by the first week of May.

INSURANCE
We know the cost but we cannot even estimate the price of not carrying it.

Camels contain the very choicest tobaccos grown in all the world. Camels are blended by the world’s most expert blenders. Nothing is too good for Camels. In the making of this one brand, we concentrate the skill of the largest organization of tobacco knowledge and tobacco experts in the world. No other cigarette made is like Camels. They are the overwhelming choice of experienced smokers.

WHEN silvery moonlight falls on town and field—and the long, joyous tour home is ready to begin—have a Camel!

WHEN moonlight washes woodland and hills with platinum light. And the tour home is ready to begin—have a Camel! For Camel makes every smooth tour smoother, adds its own contentment to every delightful journey. Camels never tire your taste or leave a cigaretty after-taste. Pay what you will, you'll never get choicer tobaccos than those in Camels. So this night as the forest-topped hills race by in moonlit processional, as the magic road curves through the colonnades of birches—have then the finest made, regardless of price. Have a Camel! Our highest wish, if you do not yet know Camel quality, is that you try them. We invite you to compare Camels with any cigarette made at any price.
