Guess what this column’s going to be about? Wrong! It’s going to be about our game with Darlington. To start with, every little white boy and darkey in the city of Rome turned out to see us work out Saturday morning because Lowry and Pete told them we were from Notre Dame.

By JOE STUKES

We were to play Tech that afternoon. Some mobbed Hose Nose for his autograph and well they might, judging from the game he played. It was as cold as it usually is on November 25 and the wind was blowing a 40-mile gale all during the workout and it looked like a miserable day for a game. During dinner, the wind slowed down a little and by four o’clock, it had completely blown itself out. The game started at eight and although there was only a little wind, it was cold enough to make ball-handling insecure. To prove that, the opening kick-off was muffed, and we got a break to start with. What breeze there was, was blowing our way and for the first quarter, we kept them bottled up. We hung on to our advantage for the rest of the half.

The second half, in contrast to the first, was full of thrills and a honey to watch. Both teams scored in the third period with passes being prominent. We took over on the Tiger 20 when their punter couldn't get his kick off and after two passes by Edwards, Lasley carried it over. A minute later Moulton caught a touchdown pass for them. Ten minutes later, Edwards threw Lowry a 35-yard pass and Lasley again scored from about a half a yard out. It should be said that Yankee and Cheatham, their two star backs, were unable to play and Black and Flourney, two other regulars, could only play five minutes. But in answer to that, we ask: Did you see Bryant, Hagan, Patterson, Pell, Covington, or Dunbar out there?

The team’s record this season was three wins, two losses, and a tie and I call that a moderately successful season. We opened with a tie with Woodberry, a couple of weeks later beat Harding 14-13. Then somebody said Barium Springs beat us 7-0. We took Mooresville 33-0 but fell before Laurinburg 27-7. Then last week we defeated Darlington 13-7. All told, we scored 11 touchdowns and 7 extra points to our opponent's 9 touchdowns and 6 extra points.

Coach Shepard did a fine job when he took over Hudson’s place after the Barium Springs game. He made the squad look like something good and it played better than it looked. He changed the whole team, changed its formation, its personnel, and in general turned in a wonderful job. He deserves a lot of credit.

The first day of basketball season seemed to turn out all right. Skipper came out and from pre-season dope, we are going to have a worthy team. In the past, Davidson’s basketball teams have always been respected, and, to a certain extent, feared. This year is to be no exception. Most of these men have had high school experience, though only one—guess who—has ever really played college ball before. But knowing Coach Shepard and his ability, I warn all opposition not to take the Wildcats lightly. They are no breeze.

The thermometer is dropping, the wind is blowing, and in general, it is getting cold around the campus of Davidson. Football is gone and basketball has a while before it comes into its own. The only sport to be found now is yelling at the freshmen. And if that darn White Horse throws another bucket of water in my room, I’m going to have some great sport.

About fifteen men have begun to field a reputation for courteous service at COLE’S DAVIDSON DINING ROOM and CAROLINA LUNCH.

Coach Shepard stated that he wished to know the exact status of each man before the schedule was made up. It is sincerely hoped that the quintet will enjoy the reputation of the college and the teams Coach Shepard’s teams enjoy.It is hoped that all men who can play basketball will report quickly.

On November 27, Coach Norman Shepard issued a call for all basketballers to report for practice. Varsity Basketball on Tuesday so that Coach may feel out the strength of his team and schedule other teams who are comparatively as strong as we are. This is as it should be because no one wants to be hopelessly outclassed in all games. Already, two games have been scheduled with North Carolina, North Carolina State, and Clemson, and others are on the way. We plan to play about eight games with service teams and as many or more with colleges. Captain Lowry forms the nucleus of the team, and others who look promising are Edwards, Bryant, Jerry, Wall, and Owens (if he comes out). The schedule should be completed soon and as soon as we get wind of any changes, we'll send it right on to you. Let's all go out and back this team with all we've got. Here's to a successful season.

Kittens Triumph In Final Game
Tigers Succumb to Successful Aerial Attack, 13-7.

On Saturday night, two comparatively light teams faced each other at Darlington Field, Rome, Ga. The home team was Darlington and the visitors were Davidson. Captain Cheatham of the Tigers won the toss and elected to receive. Barringer kicked to Wade who finally scooped the ball up and returned it to the 36. Three stabs at the line failed to net a first down so Big Glenn dropped back and kicked into a stiff wind for some 20 yards. On the first play, Barringer took a reverse and sped 13 yards. Then, with the aid of a pass interference, the Wildkittens drove to the 14-yard line. A fourth down pass, Edwards to Lasley, fell incomplete and Darlington took over. They racked up two consecutive first downs before they had to kick again. Back and forth went the see-saw game until late in the second period. Moore of Darlington tossed a long pass to Moulton, Edwards knocked the ball down into the hands of McGehee, who ran it back 20 yards; but interference was called on the play and the Tigers got the ball on the 14. On third down, McGehee again intercepted a Moore pass and the threat was passed. There were no more serious threats during the first half, Darlington having the ball at the whistle. During the half, everyone generally agreed that they were out to see just another dull football game.

Barringer began the second half by kicking to Wade. After a change of punts, Darlington was in possession on its own 33. The pass from center was high and Glenn fell on it on his own 20. Two passes, one to Lowry and one to McBride, set the stage and Lasley plowed across. Medifard’s kick was low. Darlington received the kick-off and immediately marched to pay-dirt, 63 yards away. Wade, Moore, and Glenn alternated in powering to the 14. Then Wade faded back and arched a bull's-eye to Moulton in the corner of the Davidson end zone. Darlington came to its feet when Glenn kicked the point. Edwards returned Glenn's kick-off to the 40 just before the third quarter ended with Darlington leading 7-6. Both times, Bob Reily kicked a couple of field goals and it looked as though the game might end with no further scoring. When the timekeeper’s whistle blew, the game ended.
