Epsilon featured a DJ, and the band, Cast Iron Filter, made up of Davidson students Dustin Edge '00, Randy Culbertson
'00, and Mike Orlando '02.

The second annual Fall Festival highlighted Saturday night. This event, co-sponsored by the Union Board and Patterson Court Council, featured
a free community dinner for everyone in the college outside of Vail Commons. The festival was topped off with a
performance on Patterson Court by the band Everything, best known for their hit single "Hooch."

Saturday night also featured parties thrown by fraternities and eating-houses. Kappa Alpha and Warner Hall hosted an 80's cover band,
and Phi Delta Theta and Rusk also hosted a band.

"First Night Down was the best night I've had here yet," said Webster Harrison '03. "All the frats were cool,
and the bands were great." "It was definitely worth the wait," added Adam Dutko '03, "I had a great time."
