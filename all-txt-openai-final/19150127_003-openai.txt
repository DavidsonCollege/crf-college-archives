GOLF CLUB OFFICERS AND ITS PLANS

A few days ago the golf club held its regular quarterly meeting. Since it was the first meeting of the
new year, officers were elected, as follows: President, Dr. Arbuckle; Vice-President, Mrs. Worth; Secretary, Professor Currie; and Treasurer, Dr. Moore
McConnell.

Several important matters were taken up at this meeting, among which was that concerning membership fees for college students. It
was at first considered best to allow the college students to pay $5 a session for full privileges of the
club, but on account of the complications caused by this system, the following plan was adopted: Cards will be issued
to men becoming members, and the fee will be $5 for one year. The membership would begin at the time
the fee is paid and continue until the same time next year.

At the formal opening of the two new holes on the course, there will be a social meeting of the
club members, and also it is expected that there will be an exhibition game by some fine players from Charlotte.
This opening will take place about the first week in April. This spring the whole course will be seeded in
Bermuda grass. The tournament that was to have come off before Christmas was postponed until the first part of May
on account of bad weather.
