**Freeze Statement Is Substantive Political Act**

**Dr. Brian Shaw**

Last week in these pages there appeared a thoughtful and welcome commentary on the Nuclear Freeze Movement by Tim Schipke. Mr. Schipke questions the effectiveness of the faculty statement on nuclear arms and the student referendum supporting that condemnation of the nuclear arms race. As one of the professors who lent his signature to this statement, I must answer Mr. Schipke’s challenge to the faculty to “accept ethical responsibility for their action and do something substantive.”

I would argue that the very fact that so many of us on the Davidson faculty felt moved to sign this statement is itself a “substantive” action. To endorse a document condemning the “production and deployment of first-strike weapons” is not a trivial matter. It is no mere “vacuous” reaffirmation, as Mr. Schipke implies, of hollow principles with which no one would disagree. On the contrary, to take a public stand against first-strike nuclear weapons is to oppose the military policies pursued with varying degrees of candor by the last seven American administrations. My deeply held beliefs on this matter are not those of the present government, nor those of substantial numbers of persons in the United States.

Mr. Schipke intimates that the faculty statement merely echoes things which everyone knows to be trivially true. He is mistaken; I wish he were right. There are very powerful and pervasive interests in this country who do not share my views on the morality of nuclear weapons. A substantial segment of corporate America, from Boeing and Grumman to General Electric (“We bring good things to life”) has powerful vested interests in the perpetuation of the arms race. So do many unions in America whose members’ paychecks are paid by these corporations. Even those bastions of liberal opinion, the New York Times and the Washington Post, are at best ambivalent about the merits of the freeze proposal. The freeze, the Post has sagely warned, is a “simplistic, sloganeering response to a complex issue.”

By signing the faculty statement I publicly parted company with these powerful persons and, even more to the point, with others who are not content to disagree about the arms race but who actually impugn the motives of those who oppose it. To question the prevailing wisdom about nuclear arms is to run a very real risk of character assassination and red-baiting. According to The Reader’s Digest, a not inconsiderable forum for the dissemination of ideas in this country, there is an excellent likelihood that I am a communist, or worse yet, a Soviet dupe. (See “The KGB’s Magical War for ‘Peace’” in the October 1982 issue.) Indeed, in the view of the President himself, I am part of a movement which is allegedly “inspired by not the sincere, honest people who want peace, but by some who want the weakening of America.”

Mr. Schipke, I ask you. If publicly endorsing a motion to freeze the arms race is simply an impotent bit of humanistic chest-beating, why are such influential people so anxious to smear those who engage in these actions? My own answer to this question is that these people recognize the threat posed to their positions of power and privilege by the emergence of a vigorous popular movement against nuclear weapons. The “arms race” is not something which mysteriously “happens.” It is, on the contrary, a process which is kept in motion only by the persistent collective efforts of millions of human beings. The arms race is an institution which benefits some individuals and damages others. I believe myself to be one of those who is damaged by it, for I am compelled to pay for the privilege of grievously endangering my own and other people’s welfare. Others who believe that they benefit from the perpetuation of this race would like to see it continue. Generals, bureaucrats, politicians, policy “experts,” defense contractors and defense workers all have a vested interest in the weapons spiral. A repudiation of the weapons race is a direct attack on these entrenched interests. They, of course, have fought back.

The impetus behind the freeze movement is, then, at once philosophic and political. Any attempt to persuade other individuals of the immorality and stupidity of the nuclear arms race, even if it is “merely” signing a faculty petition, is a substantive political act. Talking with and persuading one another is not the final object of political life, but it is its essential prerequisite. To engage in dialogue about matters of life and death is to engage in politics. To include ever wider sectors of the American public in this dialogue — the goal of every public statement about the arms race — is to help build the sort of popular political movement which might put an end to the arms race.End to nuclear weapons. The outcome of this process is, of course, uncertain. That the faculty statement should have prompted such an intelligent response as that of Mr. Schipke, however, confirms my belief that efforts to initiate a popular dialogue are an essential component of any movement to lessen the likelihood of a nuclear holocaust in our time.

Summer Course Credit

To the Editor:

I would like students to know of a new emphasis in dealing with academic deficiencies which are to be made up during the summer. The shoe will fit only some students, but general knowledge of it is desirable. The new emphasis is that deficiencies must really be made up by August 16 this year. That has been our stated standard for years, but in recent years Davidson has yielded on the date in instances where there was conflict between it and the necessary delay in receiving the transcript from another college. That relationship has been abused to Davidson's detriment so frequently that it has become a significant problem. Included is the fact that every year (nearly) there is someone who remains in Davidson because we didn’t have the records in time to act on ineligibility before school opens, and that is not fair to any who are ineligible based on proper records.

We are calling on students who expect to make up a deficiency at another college to check specifically and make certain the needed transcript can be at Davidson on or before August 16. If it can’t, other plans should be made. Some summer schools can take special steps to get records to Davidson if made aware of the student’s needs. Let me call your attention to the availability of contract courses through Davidson during the summer. The arrangement there has a built-in guarantee of meeting the August 16 deadline. Where there are individual problems I will be glad to consult. Without a deficiency, the deadline for receiving transcripts of summer work is November 15.

Talk and Honor

To the Editor:

Much of Davidson's highly regarded reputation rests firmly on the existence of the Honor Code. As a staunch believer in the merits of the honor system, I feel somewhat confused and disappointed when the Honor Code seems to fall into disregard. Davidson College upholds the ideal that the Honor Code covers not only academic concerns, but that its spirit permeates all campus life as well. Therefore, it particularly disturbs me when the administration itself fails to allow the Honor Code to work.

I refer to the breakdown of trust at Vail Commons. Twice this year I have been denied the right to sit with friends and talk while they ate. Because I was planning to eat at my own house on Patterson Court, I did not desire to eat at the Commons myself. I was informed that the only way I would be allowed to sit in the Commons was if I paid to eat. It seems not only a serious failure of the spirit of the Honor Code but also a genuine injustice that I have to pay merely to enjoy sitting in one of the College’s buildings. I believe something is amiss in an Honor Code that trusts students not to talk during exams but does not trust them only to talk during mealtimes.

Phi Society

To the Editor:

One of Davidson’s most unusual student organizations held its election of officers this past week. The Philanthropic Literary Society’s new President is Rick Graves, its Vice-president, John Benedict, and its Secretary Stu King. Other officers include Hunter Monroe as First Supervisor and Mike Blake as First Critic.

The Philanthropic Society was founded by students, who built their own “Hall” in 1850. The Philanthropic Hall stands opposite the Eumenean Society Hall on the old campus quadrangle. The aim of the founding students is recorded in their Constitution: “To pursue study of rhetoric, logic, and ethic, to promote a spirit of subordination to law and order by engendering a high regard for justice and truth... .”

The organization was based on parliamentary rules and procedures, and for many years played a dominant role — along with its rival Eu Society — in the social and academic lives of Davidson students. Literary Societies were an integral part of colleges throughout the South. With the advent of a college library, student government, and fraternities, the old Davidson literary societies eventually lost their central role in college life. The Philanthropic Society, however, continues in its traditional role as a distinguished forum for student and faculty speakers and as a unique experience in parliamentary organization. The Society’s semi-formal meetings are held Sunday evenings at nine and are open to all interested students.
