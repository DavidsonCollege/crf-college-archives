Congratulations of hosts of friends go to Ernest Graham, ex-'63, on his marriage to Miss Carrie Belle McNeill, Red Springs,
N.C. They were married April 10.

Among the slightly wounded men mentioned in a late casualty list was the name of Sergt. William F. Rogers, of
the class of '13. He was reported wounded several months ago, but his later letters state that he has now
entirely recovered. After graduating at Davidson, Sergeant Rogers entered the Medical School of the University of Virginia. From there he
enlisted last year in Ambulance Unit No. 517. So far as known, he is the first Davidson man wounded.

The Davidsonian acknowledges a card from Lieut. J. C. Paisley, '17, Co. "A," Seventh U.S. Infantry, A.E.F., via New York.
It read: "I have arrived safely overseas."

**Kumen Kan Society Hall is Being Beautified**

Repairs started on the Mu Society hall last fall will be continued this spring, and the hall should be in
first-rate condition by commencement time. Adjustment of the lights, several new curtains, repairs on the windows, and considerable cleaning up
will make it quite presentable.

Some items in connection with the hall that might interest folks are that in 1884 the society borrowed a thousand
dollars to furnish the hall. It was then that the desks were bought, but no stove was installed until 1869.
The steps—which had been outside before—were changed as they are now in 1890, and the carpet and opera chairs were
bought in May, 1893—just 25 years ago. It is possible that a carpet has been bought since that time, but
a handsome and expensive one was bought then, and it seems likely that it is the one now in use.
The new service flag will be hung behind the president's chair. The old chandelier will soon be disposed of.

**Regulations Followed in Student Elections**

The attention of the student body is called to the following amendment to the constitution which will govern the elections
held this spring. It was adopted by the student body last year but failed to appear in the Handbook.

**Amendment 4**

**Section 1.** A Recommendation Committee to recommend candidates for offices in the student body shall be composed of seven members:
four Seniors, two Juniors, and one Sophomore. These men shall be elected from the membership of the student council by
secret ballot of that body, the men getting the highest number of votes being elected. The Senior receiving the highest
number of votes shall be chairman of the committee.

**Sec. 2.** This committee shall recommend to the student body four men to be nominated for the office of president
of the student body; four men to be nominated for the office of first and second vice-presidents, and three men
to be nominated for the office of secretary and treasurer.

**Sec. 3.** The committee shall recommend to each class the men to be elected by secret ballot for the offices
of student councilmen. It shall recommend eight Seniors, from whom five shall be elected; five Juniors, from whom three are
to be elected; four Sophomores, from whom two shall be elected.

**Sec. 4.** These men are to be recommended by the committee and not nominated. This ruling does not prevent any
other nominations from the floor.Sec. 5. In the recommendation committee, a simple majority shall rule.

Sec. 6. The recommendation committee shall be elected from the student council by the student council not later than October
of each year.

IMPROVEMENTS MADE ON COLLEGE CAMPUS

While nature has been doing her best to beautify the campus this spring, man has also contributed his share. The
light posts in front of the library have been given a new coat of green paint, which puts them in
harmony with the rest of the campus. Work has been progressing rapidly on the Senior gift and we will soon
be able to walk from Chambers to the gym by way of the cement steps and the “white way.” Some
work has been done on the gym itself. The shower baths have been put in working order and will soon
be in shape for use by a visiting team. One thing more: last week the campus was mowed!

LE CERCLE FRANCAIS

The Bank of Davidson . . . DAVIDSON, N. C.

On change cette fois le sujet; on laisse tranquilles pour le moment les professeurs, et on discute la parallèle énoncée
par Chateaubriand entre le peuple anglais et le peuple français. Voici cette parallèle:

“Melange du sang allemand et du sang français, le peuple anglais décèle de toutes parts sa double origine. Son gouvernement,
formé de royauté et d'aristocratie; sa religion, moins pompeuse que la religion catholique; son militaire, à la fois lourd et
actif, tout participe des deux sources dont il découle. Il réunit à la simplicité, au calme, au bon sens, à
la lenteur germanique, l’éclat, l’emportement, et la vivacité de l’esprit français. Fils aînés de l’antiquité, les français, Romains par le
génie, sont Grecs par le caractère. Inquiets et volages dans le bonheur, constants et invincibles dans l’adversité; formés pour les
arts; civilisés jusqu’à l’excès durant le calme de l’État; grossiers et sauvages dans les troubles politiques; flottants, comme des vaisseaux
sans lest, au gré des passions; enthousiastes du bien et du mal; amants pusillanimes de la vie pendant la paix;
prodigues de leurs jours dans les batailles; charmants dans leur pays, insupportables chez l’étranger; tels furent les Athéniens autrefois, tels
sont les Français d’aujourd’hui.”
