Biology Professor Karen G. Hales has won the largest research grant ever awarded to a single Davidson College faculty member. She will use the five-year, $500,000 grant from the National Science Foundation to expand and enhance her genetics research. The Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program offers the National Science Foundation’s most prestigious awards for new faculty members. The CAREER program recognizes and supports the early career-development activities of those teacher-scholars who are most likely to become academic leaders. CAREER awardees are selected on the basis of creative career-development plans that effectively integrate research and education within the context of the mission of their institution.

“In my laboratory, we perform genetic analysis with the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster to explore the molecular mechanisms by which mitochondria are moved and shaped in cells,” explained Hales. “Mitochondria are the organelles often referred to as the ‘powerhouses of the cell,’ since they are the sites where energy from food is stored in ATP. In many cell types with unusual energy needs, mitochondria move in a regulated way to be close to energy-requiring structures such as flagella.” Sperm cells are a prime example of the importance of such mitochondrial moving and shaping, said Hales, whose doctoral thesis at Stanford University was “Genetic control of mitochondrial morphogenesis during Drosophila spermatogenesis.” Much remains to be learned about how the shaping of mitochondria increases the efficiency with which ATP is distributed within sperm cells and other specialized cell types, said Hales.

Biology department chair Verna Case said Hales herself is another example of a particularly strong department in both research and teaching. “We have hired within the past four years six exceptional biology professors,” Case said. “Karen Hales hit the ground running and got her research lab up and running. Her research is excellent. She is just an incredibly strong young member of our department. Our other faculty members are doing great, bringing in research money, too, both nationally and regionally.” Hales, in only her second year at Davidson, wins kudos from students, too.

**Team finishes season strong; senior Thomas named ‘All-American Witness’**

By Linny Baldwin, News Editor

In a triumphant finish for the team’s seniors, the Davidson College Mock Trial Association traveled to St. Paul, Minnesota to compete in the American Mock Trial Association’s national competition. The competition ended on a positive note and left the team’s members both flushed with their success and enthusiastic about their team’s future. Qualifying for nationals was a major achievement in and of itself, said founding member Jessica Bogo ’02. “We’ve received some negative feedback from the national organization because we’re a student-run team,” she said. “I think this trip to Nationals has solidified the strength of the program. It’s also good for the seniors who were founding members to reach this pinnacle before we graduate — there’s a bit of serendipity to it.”

Bogo was one of three attorneys on the team, along with Jason Blanford ’05 and Seth Davis ’02. Nikki Thomas ’02, Jordan Gratrix ’04, and Matt Hinson ’03 were the witnesses in the mock murder trial State of Midlands v. Ashley T. Thornhill. Amber Clarke ’02, Dan Peischl ’05, and Beth Daniel ’04 also made the trip to nationals — Clarke as a non-testifying defendant, Peischl as timekeeper, and Daniel as “support staff.” “I was extremely proud of the way the team came together,” commented Hinson.

**CAMPUS POLICE**

03/22/02 - Harassing phone call, Cannon: Subject called victim using harassing and threatening language; this crime is still under investigation.

03/23/02 - Burglary to Auto/Larceny, Satellite: Victim reported that vehicle had been burglarized and stereo had been taken.

03/24/02 - Burglary to Auto/Damage to Property, Satellite: Victim reported that car had been broken into by way of cutting the canvas convertible top on the vehicle. Nothing was taken from the vehicle.

03/24/02 - Burglary to Auto/Larceny, Satellite: Victim reported that car had been broken into by unzipping the canvas top and removing the car stereo, CDs, and a CD case.

03/24/02 - Burglary to Auto/Larceny, Martin Court (near baseball field): Victim reported that car had been broken into by piercing the canvas top; thief removed CDs.

03/24/02 - Burglary to Auto/Larceny, Senior Satellite (near greenhouse): Victim reported that car had been broken into by removing a plastic covering that was protecting a broken window. Items that were removed include a stereo/CD player, carton of cigarettes, and a cell phone and charger.

03/24/02 - Burglary to residence/Larceny, Sentelle: Victim reported that someone entered her room and removed $180.00 in cash.Absence of a coach, it was important that everyone worked as a group. To be the only team there without a coach and place 15th says a lot about my teammates.” In four rounds of competition (each round scored by two judges), DCMTA won four of its judges and ended on a positive note by claiming both judges’ votes in their fourth and final round. “We were really pleased because this was our first year,” said Bogo. “We were up against teams that have competed at the national level before and we really stood up well. It was very encouraging for the future of Mock Trial at Davidson.”

“I think that having had this experience, the team next year has an even better chance of making nationals and doing better, which I hope they do,” said founding member Thomas. “It was really special to be there with Jessica and Seth [Davis ‘02] because we’d all been there from the beginning.” Additionally, Thomas was named an All-American witness, a distinction given to competitors who do a superior job playing the case’s witnesses. “It’s kind of misleading that it was a personal award,” she commented. “I can’t do any better job than my attorney, and Jessica and Jason (the two attorneys with whom I worked) really did a fabulous job giving me a chance to show off and earn points.”

Thomas also commended freshman member Peischl, saying, “Without Dan, we would have been totally lost. He kept us on track, kept track of our stuff, and generally put up with us, which is more than we could have asked of anyone. ‘Dan’s got it’ may be our inside joke, but it’s a comforting one. Jessica, Seth and I didn’t have to worry about a lot of stuff this year that we had to worry about in the past because Dan took care of it.” Hinson echoed the praise, saying, “[Dan] was the glue that kept us solid throughout.”

Bogo strongly believes that, even after the founding members graduate, DCMTA will continue to grow and succeed. “Going to nationals and seeing how well we stood up against the other teams let us know how strong we are. [The other members] are already taking ownership of the organization and preparing for next year.”

Biologist’s research gets NSF grant. “She has great communication skills,” said Sean Burke ’02, a member of Hales’ lab. “She can really explain scientific literature in a way that I can understand it... and if a few days go by when I don’t write much in my lab notebook, even her body language can get a message across!” Travel to scientific conferences is another big plus, said Burke, and one that is particularly rare for undergraduates. Some of Hales’ NSF grant money will go toward conference travel. “You learn more about science than just what you are doing,” said Burke. “Yours may be the first eyes besides the researchers’ to see emerging scientific conclusions.”

The federal grant money will permit Hales to hire a lab technician, freeing her and her students from lab maintenance responsibilities and allowing them to spend more time on actual experiments throughout the year, including summer. The cost of equipment, materials and supplies for the construction of transgenic flies in her own lab is also in Hales’ winning grant proposal. Transgenic flies have exogenously added DNA that has been specially designed to allow study of the function of particular genes.

Potato Drop

Davidson students contributed to the fight against hunger in Mecklenburg County on Saturday, March 16. The Davidson United Methodist Church sponsored several different community service programs on this day and PCC’s most notable event, the Potato Drop, which occurred at the Davidson IB School. Local grocery stores such as Harris Teeter donated pounds and pounds of potatoes that did not meet the stores’ shape standards. The service project united members of the community with Davidson students, allowing groups to work together towards one goal. Forty Davidson students aided the project, the majority of students being PCC members. Students helped with putting together boxes, boxing the potatoes, and delivering the food to various charitable organizations. The event was held from 9 am-1 pm, but most Davidson students participated in a shift from 9-11, or 11-1. The event was a success resulting in the bagging of 40,000 pounds of potatoes. PCC will be sponsoring more service events throughout the semester, and all students are encouraged to participate. For more information, contact PCC representatives.
