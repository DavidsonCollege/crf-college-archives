#### Sig Eps and Fijis to Submit Their Own Proposals

The “Patterson Court Council” has developed a proposal to limit noise levels during all college social events. The Sig Eps will submit their own proposal to go before the Town Council for final approval within the next month. “This is the College’s proposal for a noise ordinance as opposed to having a town-wide ordinance,” explained Joe. The S.G.A. discussed it on Tuesday night, and Dean of Students Will Terry must review it before it goes to the Town Council, he added.

The proposal was modeled after the Chapel Hill noise ordinance, Joe said. “It is probably—definitely—going to pass,” he added.

Maximum legal limits on the sound emanating from any event will be set, as measured from the nearest property line. Outdoor athletic events, construction operations, church bells, warning devices, Spring Frolics events, fireworks, and lawn mowers are exempt from the limits.

Dean Terry’s office will issue permits for special events to exceed the normal limits by approximately 15 decibels, as measured from the nearest property line. The actual noise limits, with and without a permit, are still subject to debate, Joe said. They will definitely be lower than the limits in the Chapel Hill ordinance, “because Davidson is a quiet town,” Joe said. He hoped that the proposal is “restrained enough so the town will be happy, and free enough so we will be happy.”

There will be a five dollar administration fee for permits issued at least 48 hours in advance. Otherwise, the fee will be ten dollars. Exceeding the legal limits will carry a fine of 100 dollars.

What will happen to the money has not yet been decided, Joe said. Davidson College police will enforce the noise levels, with a state-owned sound level meter. The money raised from fees and fines may go into a fund to buy sound-measuring equipment.

Fiji President Jim Troutman is “willing to go along with it,” [the proposal] he said. In his view, the College and off-campus proposals must be similar in three respects. They will have to specify the same noise levels, the same fine, and give the College the power to enforce the levels.

Joe Ford explains that since the Patterson Court Houses have a sort of “buffer zone,” a long distance separating them from the nearest town resident, their effective noise levels will be higher than those for the off-campus fraternities. Troutman disagrees, but he does not foresee the noise limits having any effect on the Fiji social calendar.

“The last party we had was a little quieter, and a lot of people liked it better that way,” he explained. He didn’t think that the noise limits would cause more Fiji parties to be at F & M.

The presidents of ETC and PAX also predicted no great effect upon their parties. “Most of our parties are indoors anyway,” said Mike Healey (’82), President of PAX. Joe said that SGA President Chip Legerton put him in charge of the noise proposal because “I have been very interested in it from the start.”

#### Center Saved

The Educational Policy Committee voted down a proposal on Monday to recommend to the faculty that the Center for Social Studies be closed.

The Committee was responding to a proposal introduced by religion Professor Max Polley, that included the closing of the Center in order to strengthen the Departmental Majors.

Several students circulated a petition in support of the Center when the EPC started to consider closing it. Sophomore Elizabeth Smiley said the petition would be sent to Dr. Zimmermann to present to the faculty.

According to the chairman of the Committee, Vice-President for Academic Affairs Dr. T. C. Price Zimmermann, the committee wants to strengthen the senior year by encouraging seniors to pursue honors studies and write senior theses. There was some question on the part of the faculty as to whether faculty members could work at the Center without weakening their work with majors in their own department.

According to Psychology Professor John Kelton, a member of the EPC, some faculty members felt that having a faculty member at the Center makes it difficult to encourage and oversee theses.

As part of the plan to discontinue the center, the proposal would have established an Interdisciplinary Committee in order to allow students to pursue interdisciplinary studies. Dr. Kelton said this committee would have provided for courses in interdisciplinary study only, and not majors.

Since the Committee voted in favor of recommending the continuation of the Center, however, they deemed the Interdisciplinary Committee unnecessary.

Dr. Kelton said that as far as he knew no one on the Committee is planning to bring up the issue of discontinuing the Center at the upcoming faculty meeting. He said the Committee discussed the matter and decided that the gains for the departments by discontinuing the Center were not worth the losses.

The Committee did approve recommendations to the faculty on three points designed to strengthen work in the departmental majors. They recommended that [1] a description of all honors theses appear in the Commencement program; [2] that the Commencement program mention only cum laude and Honors Program achievements; [3] and, Professors should receive one teaching credit for every six honors or senior theses supervised.
