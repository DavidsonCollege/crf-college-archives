TOURNAMENT MAY BE MOVED TO CHARLOTTE

CHANCES of getting the Southern Conference tournament moved to Charlotte next year are improving every day. Wrote Bob Quincy, sports
editor of The Charlotte News, in his Thursday night column: Writers around the Conference are being polled as to their
opinions on moving the tournament from Richmond to the Coliseum... The peony gee awe at Davidson, plus the city’s accessibility
to all schools, would be a factor of consideration. As it now stands, school officials at West Virginia, Furman, The
Citadel, and, of course, Davidson favor moving the event to Charlotte. Only one more vote of confidence would swing the
deal, and then the wheels could start turning to produce actual results. Just where the other vote will come from
remains to be seen. Richmond, VPI, and William & Mary would probably never concede to the proposal. That leaves VMI
and George Washington with the power to give the final o.k. to a needed change. The recent tournament at Richmond
drew only about 18,000 fans in three nights. Receipts were hardly enough to pay for all of the teams’ traveling
expenses, much less enough to meet all the other expenses of a three-day tournament. With the right promotion, and if
our local Wildcats come through like they’re supposed to, the tournament could draw close to 30,000 fans (10,000 a night)
in three nights in the Charlotte Coliseum. Since the purpose of the tournament is to make money for the conference,
the move to Charlotte seems like a logical action.

Probably the best solution to the whole problem is to do away with the tournament entirely. It seems to us
that the team that wins the regular season championship has the sole right to represent the conference in the NCAA
playoffs. Suppose we finished first during the regular season next year (and it’s entirely possible), but lost the chance to
play for the national title in the tournament. We'd be upset to say the least. Such has been the case
for West Virginia for the past eight years. Only once have they lost the tournament after being regular season champs—last
year to George Washington—but imagine the frustration of the poor Mountaineer coach each year at tournament time. Chuck Noe, VPI’s
non-sympathetic coach, said after his team had been thoroughly trounced by the Mounties in the finals of this year’s tourney,
“I feel real sorry for George King (WVU head coach). His team proves they're the best in the conference all
year long, and then they have to do it all over again in the tournament.”

IN THE CITADEL’S POOL THIS WEEKEND

Spirited ’Catfish in Conference Meet

The Davidson College swimmers left day before yesterday for Charleston, S.C., where they are participating in the Southern Conference meet
being held this weekend in The Citadel’s pool. The ’Catfish completed their regular schedule last week by losing both of
their meets on their trip into Virginia. William & Mary splashed them, 50-45, last Thursday, while VMI, probably the best
team in the conference, dunked them, 57-47, the following day. The two losses gave the swimmers an overall record of
3-7 for the season—one of the worst records a Dwight Shoe-coached team has ever compiled. However, Shoe and his men
are out to rectify themselves this weekend in the one that counts. Although they carried a poor record and a
not-much-chance-of-winning tab to the conference meet, the ‘Catfish were in high spirits when they left. “VMI and The Citadel are
definitely the teams to beat this year,” explains Shoe, “and we'll be in there fighting.” Davidson’s best prospects for the
meet include Carter Mebane in the 220 and 440-yd. freestyle, Bill Whittington in the diving events, Stefan Young in the
200-yd. butterfly and 200-yd. breaststroke, Barry Branch and Jack Hollenbeck in the 100-yd. freestyle, and Tommy French in the 200-yd.
backstroke.

Fijis Take I-F Wrestling Crown

The Phi Gams walked away with the laurels in this year’s I-F wrestling tournament on the mats of Johnston Gymnasium
on Tuesday and Wednesday of this week. Taking three out of nine first places, the Fijis outpointed their nearest competitors,
the SAE’s, by 67-49. The SAE’s were defending champions. The Phi Delts, who currently lead the overall point race for
the I-F sports trophy, finished fourth behind the Sigma Chis. Team scores were as follows:

Phi Gams 67
SAE’s 49
Sigma Chi 36
Phi Delts 34
Pi Kapps 25
Betas 22
Independents 14
Sig Eps 12
Kappa Sigs 11
Sigma Nus 9
Pikas 0

Individual results of the finals are as follows:
123—Ken Painter (Phi Delt) pinned John Shue (Sig Ep).
130—Mike Nemir (Phi Gam) pinned Jimmy Lawton (Beta).
137—Al Mullen (Ind.) defeated Charles Arthur (Sigma Chi).
147—George Pepper (Sigma Chi) defeated Ivon Rohrer (SAE).
157—Pete Jorgeson (Pi Kappa) defeated Walt McNairy (SAE).
167—John Cameron (Phi Delt) pinned Dick Voorhees (Kappa Sig).
177—Don Hall (Phi Gam) pinned Glenn Hanes (SAE).
191—Tom Stevens (Phi Gam) pinned Dick Voorhees (Kappa Sig).
Heavyweight—John Cameron (Phi Delt) pinned Glenn Hanes (SAE).

The baseball team, under Tom Stevens, will open their schedule next Saturday here against Pfeiffer. The following Monday, Dr. Tom
Scott and his golfers journey to High Point College for their first match. On Tuesday, March 20, Harry Fogleman makes
his debut as head tennis coach as his netters entertain Pfeiffer. The other spring sport, track, VMI, sporting three individual
conference champions (winners of six events between them), are favored to retain their championship.

THE HUSTLER

SPEAKING of our “muscle-building program,” we understand that Lefty Driesell left this week in search of some more basketball talent.
Driesell, who claims that next year’s freshman crop will be as good or better than this year’s despite fewer scholarships,
took off for the section of our country where basketballs instead of rattles are placed in babies’ cribs—the Midwest. Following
a trip into Pennsylvania, the young hustler will extensively cover Indiana and Ohio in hopes of persuading several roundball artists
to become Davidson Gentlemen. Driesell’s hard work will soon bring big dividends. As a writer for the Greensboro Daily News
recently said, “Word is out that Davidson College will finish no worse than...”third place in the Southern Conference next year.”
In no way does this statement overrule the possibility of a championship club.

victories over the SAE’s and KA’s. The wins were the 8th and 9th straight for the Sigs, who are undefeated
with three remaining games.

The Phi Delts took possession of third place with a too-close-for-comfort three-point win over the Pi Kapps. This week's I-F
checklist includes the following:

Last Thursday the Sigma Chis, led by reserve Jeff Wampler’s 17 points, defeated the Pi Kapps, 57-46. Last Friday the

Betas. Led by Billy Bankhead’s 11 points, the Phi Delts nipped the Pi Kapps, 37-34, with some last-second clutch free
throwing. Leading by as much as 10 points at certain stages of the game, the Pi Kapps, paced by freshman
Harold Kernodle’s 12 points, almost pulled the upset of the year. Jim Fuller scored 19 and Durwood Settles added 17
as the Phi Gams overpowered the Sigma Nus, 78-30.

Conference Toughies Subdue ’Cat Matmen
BY BILL PRIDGEN
Davidsonian Staff Writer

Davidson’s matmen, after finishing their best regular season in 25 years, met stiffer competition at the Southern Conference tournament in
Blacksburg, Va., last weekend. However, Alexander Mills defeated The Citadel for the 167-pound class, and took first place again this
year. Fourth place finishes were earned by Tom Wright, 123-pound class; Linton Wray, 137-pound class; Jim Alexander, 177-pound class; and
Tom Day, heavyweight.

The Citadel, with a much-improved team, managed to come out second. The Citadel's 157-pound ace, Jeff Hartsell, from Albemarle, N.
C., was voted the outstanding wrestler of the tournament. This mark could finish the Wildcats’ best season in 25 years.

Coach Charlie Parker has a strong nucleus around which to build next year’s team. With only two seniors graduating, Parker
is optimistic about next year’s campaign.

“And when I get that next promotion...”

However short on furnishings, new homes are filled with love. The kind of love that finds time for hand-holding, hope-sharing,
and dream-weaving. The man who has love in his heart has goals to reach. It is squarely up to business
to constantly create jobs with opportunities as big as the man who wants them.
