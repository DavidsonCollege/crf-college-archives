Theft, carelessness & abuse library, ‘Honor Code

By STEVE AUSTIN

The Davidson College library has lost about 800 books over a 3-year period from 1974-1977 according to Director of the
library Leland M. Park in a report to the SGA senate.

The loss is down somewhat from a high in 1973 but Park is concerned about its reflection on the honor
code. He is disappointed that the library’s policy of openness is not more appreciated. Said Park of the library’s system:
“This is so much better than our proteges’ in the academic world.”

No checks are made at the door and no staff member is present after 10 pm.

Besides the problem of lost books, the library staff must go around at the end of each year to the
halls and houses to collect unchecked books. The books are not stolen; they finally end back in the library but
Park calls the practice a “gross discourtesy.”

Faculty members are part of the problem too. Park tells the story of how he had to search the office
of a professor gone for the summer, for an overdue book and found a number of others that were unchecked.
Two systems to reduce the number of losses were suggested by Park but not necessarily recommended. The first would place
a magnetic strip in each book that would trigger an alarm if a patron tried to exit without checking his
books. The second would involve having student workers check each person leaving the building.

Senator Dave Barnard opted for a tougher policy for the honor code violators.

He commented that forgetfulness is not the problem: “These are stolen books; the honor code is the answer.” However, neither
the senate nor Park wanted to turn to room checks which are common at some schools.

Jim Tholen summed up the Senate’s feelings by saying that the solution is to “prick the consciousness of the students.”
The body voted to do so by sending letters to every dorm and administrative room.

Cost of replacing lost books:

Classification # of books lost
000’s 7
100’s 34
200’s 69
300’s 170
400’s 10
500’s 38
600’s 46
700’s 44
800’s 174
900’s 82
Davidsoniana Room Books 5
Fiction 24
Folios 8
Chemistry Library Books 12
Reference 41
Bound Periodicals 23
Grand Total 787

At the average cost today (minimum) it would cost $15 per book to replace it, not including the cost of
processing it again into the collection. 262 books average for the last three years x $15 = $3,930.00 per year.
2,739 books lost in the last nine years x $15 = $41,085.00

Comparison with previous years:
1974/75-1976/77 787 books = 262 average per year
1973/74 304
1972/73 451
1971/72 360
1970/71 248
1969/70 262
1968/69 327
Nine year total 2739

Breakfast policy clarified

Questions have recently arisen over an ARA Food Service policy that prohibits meal card holders from using their cards to
purchase anything other than a continental breakfast at the snack bar from 10-11 AM.

The continental breakfast includes coffee or milk, sweet roll and juice. Eggs and other items are sold on a cash
basis and cannot be bought with a meal ticket because the ARA contract does not provide for such an arrangement.

ARA Director Ron Scott explained that the price of the dining club plan is based on about 40 percent of
its members eating breakfast and 70-80 people taking advantage of the continental breakfast.

Scott says he is looking into the possibility of offering continuous service in the next few years.

Meanwhile, Scott advises late-eaters not to consider the continental breakfast an “extended breakfast,” but rather an additional service.

Extended studies settled

The Faculty passed the Educational Policy Committee’s (EPC) proposals concerning Extended Studies last week with only minor revision.

The EPC proposed to keep Extended Studies for freshmen and sophomores with only two changes. Most projects will be under
departmental supervision and all will be graded only pass-fail.

Mandatory Extended Studies 301s and 401s for juniors and seniors will be abolished. Instead, individual departments will have the choice
of whether to keep the projects or to establish new major requirements.

Professors will be limited to sponsoring only three projects per year to lessen their teaching load.

Extended Studies Committee Chairman Hansford Epes is pleased with the proposals, because he believes placing freshmen and sophomore projects under
departments will help to make the students more conscientious.
