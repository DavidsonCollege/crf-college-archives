Vagt calls limited access
for freshmen ‘ludicrous’

At the SGA meeting last Thursday, Presi-
dent Charles Washington ’04 revealed to the
body that its goal of cable in all student dorm
rooms had become a reality.

Washington announced that he had re-
ceived a letter from President Vagt approv-
ing the cable resolution.

In response to an initial decision to with-
hold cable from freshmen dorm rooms, Vagt
made it clear that “if it’s open, it’s going to
be open to all students.”

According to Washington, cable will be
provided on a “pay for it if you want it” basis
and will include freshmen. He added that it
will be available, “as soon as possible,”
which may or may not be as early as next
year, since there are logistical questions
including which provider to use.

Sophomore class President Jack Hubbard
’06 originally began the SGA’s campaign
for cable last spring in response to what he
saw as discontent among students because
of the lack of cable access on campus.

An October survey conducted by SGA
found that 80 percent of students thought
cable should be available in residence halls.
The survey also found 40 percent of stu-
dents would still want cable if they had to
pay for it.

Richard Shayegan ’07 felt that the deci-
sion will be beneficial for students.

Court Selection runs smoothly with new sorting method

This past weekend Patterson Court witnessed the newest wave
of fraternity pledges and eating house inductees descend upon
the court.

Court selection began with the announcement of eating house
selections on Friday afternoon. Approximately two-thirds of
the girls received their first choice.

“It worked out for most people,” said Julia Brown ’07, a new
member of Warner Hall.

Most fraternities and eating houses kicked off the evening
with initiation activities for their newest members. The nature
of these activities differed from house to house. Fraternity lead-
ership describes the evening’s events as a chance for the pledges
to have a good time.

KA officer Tyler Covington ’05 said, “Our house tries to make
this weekend as fun as possible for the freshmen...The week-
end is really designed for them in the first place.”

This approach was a common theme, with fraternities aban-
doning the hazing rituals that are so closely associated with
initiations.

“We worked pretty hard to get these guys, so we won’t treat
them too bad,” assured Matt Monson ’05, a SAE officer.

The eating houses also featured their own initiation activi-
ties. Eating house leadership reports that the night’s activities
centered on the freshmen’s enjoyment.

“Things went better than ever,” said Warner president Rachael
Voyles of last Friday. “For Warner Hall, court selection night
is simply about having fun.”

After initiation activities had concluded on Friday, most court-
goers crowded into several eating houses for the remainder of
the night. Warner Hall was the scene for much of the dancing
despite a floor covered in syrup, chocolate and other fluids left
over from initiation.

“Everybody was trying to do laundry in the morning,” said
Travis Brown ’07.
