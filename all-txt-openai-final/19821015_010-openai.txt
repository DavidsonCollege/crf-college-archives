### Sunday Night at the PTL
#### Students encounter glossolalia and huge plastic animals
By JEFF DEMPSEY ’83

Last Sunday night, two Davidson students put on their coats and ties and headed down I-77 toward Charlotte. They continued until the first exit in South Carolina where they exited and turned left. Two miles later, they turned into an entrance marked with a large sign: Heritage USA.

Heritage USA is a large complex that serves as the national headquarters for the Praise the Lord (PTL) Club. The little road now twisted along through camping grounds, past tennis courts, a miniature golf course, McMoose’s fast food, and more plastic animals. A man at the gate handed us the Heritage Herald and gave us directions to the television studios, The Barn. As we left the entrance, a row of nations’ flags ran along one side of the narrow road. On the other side, one sign read: “Speed Limit-33” and the next: “Speed checked by God.”

We drove for several minutes through thick woods, past Dogwood Hills Condominiums, and across the railroad tracks where we went right. The speed limit changed to 22. As we came upon the general store, we noted the first of a series of huge plastic animals (a pig, a moose, and a few cows) that dotted the roadsides. The little road now twisted along through camping grounds, past tennis courts, a miniature golf course, McMoose’s fast food, and more plastic animals. We continued to follow signs for The Barn and slowed as the signs changed from 22 to 17 to 12. Finally, The Barn loomed before us, and we hunted down a parking place in the spacious lot.

Inside, we hurried through the lobby/bookstore toward the sounds of clapping and singing coming from the studios beyond. We entered an expansive blue-carpeted auditorium containing about 300 people and found seats near the back. On stage, before a brightly-colored background of springtime meadows, a man played a white grand piano to the singing of a young woman. A sign with large yellow lettering sat on top of the piano: Camp Meeting. Plastic flowers ringed the foot of the stage. Four large television cameras roved the area directly in front of the stage, while two others were situated on raised areas in the audience. Our view was partially obscured by camera number two in particular.

When the couple finished their hymn, they were joined on stage by a genial middle-aged man in a light suit, a certain Rev. Smith. Rev. Smith welcomed the audience, directed our attention to the monitors overhead, and led us in clapping as the taped beginning to the ol’ Camp Meeting came onto the screens. The singing couple opened the show with another hymn after which Rev. Smith reappeared to welcome the audience at home. One more hymn later, they left and the smiling reverend took this opportunity to invite the audience at home to order two great new books written by the leaders of the PTL club: Jim’s Survival: Unite to Live and Tammy Faye’s book on fear, Run to the Lord. Jim’s “Success” tapes were also available for a love offering of $25, and for a gift of $15 per month, a person can become a PTL Partner and then receive a Partner’s card, a Partner’s pen, a Partner’s lapel pin, and a desk sign saying “You can make it.”

Charles Hunter had converted a 10-year-old boy who had dialed the wrong number.Then time for the evening’s guest hosts, the Happy Hunters, to come out. The Happy Hunters, an evangelical couple from Texas, indeed lived up to their name. With exuberant exclamations of “Praise God!”, they let everyone know that they were “blessed, anointed, and speaking the Word of God” and immediately began telling anecdotes of greeting people with the message that Jesus wants to be their savior. By answering the phone with “God is fabulous. Do you know Jesus?”, for example, Charles Hunter had converted a 10-year-old boy who had dialed the wrong number. In similarly brief encounters, they had led airport employees, grocery store bagboys, and people in bus stations to the Lord.

Charles was eager to share a recent vision that had greatly affected him. Awakened in the middle of the night of September 20, he sat up in bed and began to have a vision of a farmer standing before a tremendous field of grain. The farmer was reveling in the plentiful grain ready for harvest when a great storm suddenly came up and destroyed the field. In this way, Mr. Hunter warned, the Final Judgement is going to destroy the unsaved—and we, “the disciples of the End Generation,” must work to save as many souls as possible in these final days.

Francis Hunter then read from the Bible and discussed sin. She talked mostly about smoking and drinking as sins that a Christian should overcome, but, she added, gossiping is just as bad as these and can keep one out of Heaven just as easily. At this point, Francis had everyone stand, lift up their hands, and repeat after her a “sinner’s prayer” that ended with all loudly proclaiming “I am saved.” Afterwards, everyone turned to their neighbors, shook hands, and told each other that they were saved.

Francis’ prayer ended the hour-long television program, though it did not end the service for the live audience. The cameramen quietly abandoned their cameras (at last I could see the entire stage), while Charles picked up on the subject of speaking in tongues. He sent an invitation for all who wished to speak in tongues to come stand in front of the stage. The next 20 minutes were then spent explaining how speaking in tongues became a part of the Hunters’ ministry, why ordinary people who have been saved can speak in tongues, and how to do it. Every saved person, Mr. Hunter said, using passages of Scripture to back up his argument, has this ability to talk directly to God in a “perfect language.” The Devil hates this and tries to prevent it by placing doubt in your mind. But, as Mr. Hunter demonstrated, you need only to let the syllables flow out without thinking about them to be successful. Having finally finished with all the prefatory remarks, Mr. Hunter then counted to three and on three the entire audience, those seated as well as those in front of the stage, lifted up their hands and began speaking in gibberish.

My friend and I had to leave at this point and so we slipped out. Through the dark parking lot, into the car, by the plastic animals, past the sign at the exit: “God loves you and so do we—Jim and Tammy,” back onto I-77. Speed limit-55.
