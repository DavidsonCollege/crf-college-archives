THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

**Wandering In The Wilderness**

Dean Frontis Johnston began the 1-2-5 Club program in Charlotte this week with Dean Rusk’s comment on Davidson during his
1950 visit: “It’s like returning to the Old Testament.” The topic under 1-2-5 discussion was Davidson, An International College.

Increasing numbers of Davidson students are showing interest in study overseas. The past few years have seen Davidsonians in many
European universities and even Africa and Asia. The Richardson Scholarships have populated the campus with foreign students for several years.
Faculty, administration, and students generally give lip service to “an international college.” Davidson is certainly less provincial now than a
few years ago. We maintain that we are living under a New Commandment. But, in reality, our students abroad and
foreign students here must still struggle against the most pharisaical of administrative detail.

The college gives no encouragement to students interested in international study. There are only the barest attempts at the dissemination
of information on the departmental level. If a student manages to seek admission to a foreign university on his own
initiative, academic, living, and travel conditions are destined to remain a mystery until he steps onto foreign soil. Adequate academic
advice to the prospective foreign student is practically non-existent. Since the standard procedures of credit transferral do not always apply,
the student receives no assurance that his work will be accredited. Students on scholarship are unable to use their stipends
for foreign study.

The prevailing ignorance about foreign education not only hampers the prospective student but endangers the academic standards of Davidson, which
must often work in the dark in evaluating credits taken abroad. If by negligence we restrain our students from study
in foreign countries, a petty over-watchfulness seriously reduces the effectiveness of international students on the Davidson campus. Foreign students naturally
want to become acquainted with all aspects of American life, not just Chambers and their dormitories. They cannot be of
service to us unless they know America well and unless they have ample time to participate in our activities, lead
discussions, or just sit down over a cup of coffee. By insisting on a strict adherence to attendance regulations intended
for the native student and by other unnecessary hindrances and demands on the time of foreign students, the college limits
the opportunity of our foreign students to “internationalize” Davidson. A sluggard program for organizing foreign student participation in forums, discussions,
and other activities has not helped the situation.

Even if we allow the Public Relations Office a certain degree of poetic license, the gap between Dean Rusk’s Old
Testament institution and an “international college” is still disappointingly great.

**The Scheduling Committee Can Still Redeem Itself**

Why doesn’t the faculty's committee on Academic Scheduling make up a permanent exam schedule? Every semester since we can remember
Dr. Drake and his committee have run up against constant opposition to their efforts. And he has a lot of
problems to contend with (See article on this page). Then, too, every semester Mr. Hengeveld’s office is plagued with demands
for schedule changes. Many students complain of having three or four exams in a row, while others go for three
or four days without any exams scheduled.

Second semester exams have always run eight days. First semester exams also took eight days until the faculty three years
ago decided in favor of a two-day break between semesters. These two days were taken from the first semester exam
period. This year the faculty, by a very slim margin, restored the two days. Some need two extra days, they
say, to grade papers and prepare final grades. The students like the added time, too, some say—it gives them more
time to study.

We would like to see both the students and the professors satisfied. But we personally feel that six days is
ample for first semester exams, especially if an extra day can be thrown in at the beginning of the period
for reading and preparing. One solution can be worked out this year: reduce the exam period to six days and
add the two extra days to the semester anyway, since classes will end on a Saturday and exams will begin
on a Monday. And we are willing to bet the students and faculty would approve of two extra days of
vacation. If the professors need extra time to grade papers, wouldn’t they rather have those days after exams were over?
This would still give them a chance to get away for a short vacation themselves.

Of course, such a solution may not be possible in future years. We are not campaigning for a four-day semester
break. The two extra days might well be restored to the summer vacation, pushing ahead the opening date of school.
We see the need to establish a permanent exam schedule for each semester which would be the result of a
thorough comparison of the number of students involved in each hour, the number of sections taking the test, etc. Every
four or five years the schedule would have to be reexamined, but the permanency would appeal to students and faculty
alike.

Accompanying this proposal is a continued plea to the registrar’s office to permit more section-switching and individual schedule-changing. No system
can treat all students fairly, and the individual deserves a chance to do as well as his fellows on each
exam. Ideally, each student should be able to arrange an exam schedule for himself by conference with his professors. Since
we are not yet this advanced, a six-day exam schedule for first semester exams, based on thorough study, and put
on a permanent basis, is a most reasonable solution.

**In Search Of A Purpose**

“To do good we must first know good; to serve beauty we must know beauty; to speak the truth we
must first know the truth. We must know these things ourselves, be able to recognize them by ourselves, be able
to describe, explain, and communicate them by ourselves, and wish to do so, when no one else is present to
prompt us or bargain with us. Such knowledge is the purpose of a liberal education.” — President Griswold of Yale

**TAIL WAGS THE DOG**

**Students, Faculty Protest Early Start**

BY JOHN A. CARSON
Davidsonian Managing Editor

The Academic Scheduling Committee, at its own discretion, decided that classes should begin several days earlier than in previous years.
Surely none would gripe about such a small change as this, would they? They did. And it may be predicted
that much more will be heard in the days to come. A sample of the many complaints registered is as
follows: Dr. George Staples and the YMCA—This move ruled out all possibilities for a Freshmen Y-Camp.

**LETTER TO THE EDITOR**

**Papra Slashes Honor System; Demands Sweeping Changes**

Dear Editor:

The Honor System at Davidson needs a great deal of revision. The cruelty and blindness of its penalties demand it,
as well as the fact that the Honor Court has no deterrent value. The Honor Court sets a merciless precedent
by refusing to accept extenuating circumstances in its judgments. Fear has no deterrent value. In Monday's assembly, we heard about
one student who was pressured into cheating; a student who until then was judged honest. Did fear of punishment deter
him? Did fear deter the others who cheated, lied, etc.? The implication is that we are animals who know no
basis for compliance with rules other than fear. At this same assembly, we were told that offenses are committed because
the will to refrain is overwhelmed by the need to commit the offense. The offender is punished for what he
could not help doing. Prevention would be more desirable than punishment.

On a different level, the problem of capital punishment has illustrated that fear is no deterrent. In England, public hangings
of pickpockets (done for deterrent values) were abolished because too many pockets were picked at these hangings. It is not
the horror of the punishment but the certainty of punishment which deters.

The penalties which the Honor Court inflicts are too...

**Mansell Explains Y Purpose**

BY FRANK MANSELL
YMCA President

The Davidson College Y.M.C.A. seeks to witness the Christian faith in the communities of the college, the nation, and the
world. It is committed to service through positive action as well as worship and study. Every person in the college
community, whether students or members of the faculty or administration, who is interested in and who is willing to work
within the provisions of a program based on this purpose, is invited to participate in the activities of the Y.M.C.A.
These activities will be centered in the same basic areas of interest as they were last year. Increased emphasis will
be put on the areas of International Relations and Social Life, two aspects...of the program which have been slighted in
previous years. A full program of community service is planned. Students will be working with the scouts and athletic teams,
in the teen canteen, and in the recreational programs of the local schools. Students will also be teaching Sunday School
at Barium Springs each Sunday as well as supplying nearby pulpits and working with youth groups in the churches. Whereas
these areas of the Y.M.C.A.’s work are limited in the number of students they can employ, other areas encourage as
many persons as care to participate. The area of Spiritual Life invites all members of the college community to attend
devotional chapel services each Wednesday and Friday morning at 10:20 in Lingle Chapel. Also, student-prepared private devotional material will soon
be made available to the student body. All college personnel are urged to attend the various forums and discussions during
the year which will feature outstanding guests on our campus as well as members of our own college family. The
highlight of this series will be the Book-of-the-Year program next spring. The Y.M.C.A. depends on the members of the college
community to participate in these various aspects of its program and to support the work through voluntary financial gifts. Without
your support in both of these ways, the Y.M.C.A. on the Davidson campus can never carry out the purpose for
which it exists. All of the activities of the Y.M.C.A. are made available to you in order that you have
an opportunity to voluntarily engage in worship, study, and positive action within the context of the Christian faith. You are
encouraged to take advantage of these opportunities during this school year.

Harsh, too severe, and too permanent. It approximates the “A” on the adulteress’s shoulder. Another fault of the Honor Court
is that it has taken upon itself the duty of interpreting the spirit of these laws. Thus they gave themselves
unlimited authority. The reason for having laws defined was for the protection of the innocent, so that they could not
be groundlessly punished. This idea of interpreting the spirit of the law has no precedent in Law; the Judicial System
may not interpret the spirit of the law in America. Yet, the Honor Court has taken this right, even without
due process of majority vote on the matter. I propose certain revisions in the Court and in the system. Stealing
offenses should be brought to the attention of the criminal courts, where such offenses belong. Those found guilty of cheating
by the court should automatically fail that unit of work in which they cheated; this is certainly a suitable “punishment.”
Those who are found guilty of lying under oath or failing to report infractions should be punished at the discretion
of the court to an extent not to include dismissal from college. Next, the Honor Court must relinquish the power
to interpret the spirit of the law. Instead, if it finds it necessary, it should revise and add to the
laws with the consent of the faculty and student body. Most important of all, education should receive more stress. Let
everyone be told why honesty is valuable, and why he should be honest in his own dealings, and be alert
to the honesty of others. Let each offense be dealt with in and of itself, realizing all circumstances involved. To
replace fear as a deterrent, let us have education; to replace severe penalties imposed on the crime, let us have
sane judgments with regard to the offender and the offense as individual.

Mrs. J. B. Moore, supervisor of the dormitories, was concerned because all of the hall counselors had to be at
school on Labor Day. Bob Waugh, president of the Inter-Fraternity Council, was “very dissatisfied” with the effects of Rush Week
and a full week of classes coinciding. For the past several years classes have not begun before Wednesday of Rush
Week. These were the comments from some of the higher brass. However, they were not the only ones affected. Many
professors found that the earlier start did not allow them time to return from summer commitments. Dr. W. O. Puckett
had to leave a week early from a course he was taking at the National Health Institute. Freshmen themselves who
were just beginning to get settled, found the week of classes and rushing to be quite a problem. The question
rang out from all sides: Why did classes begin so early this year? The answers were many and varied. Mrs.
Grover Meetze, secretary to Dean Johnston, stated: “We never had this trouble before the Academic Scheduling Committee was started.” Dr.
J. T. Drake, chairman of the Academic Scheduling Committee, said that the school had to end early to allow for
the summer school program. When asked who set the dates for the summer session, he said he did not know.
“Then the whole academic year is set up around the summer program?” Dr. Drake was asked. “Yes," he replied. “It’s
like the tail wagging the dog.” The reason for this? Again Dr. Drake did not know. F. W. Hengeveld, registrar,
was approached with the question of summer school. He explained that it must begin in early June and run through
late August in order to allow for the four three-week sessions. Hengeveld also brought up the point that an extra
day has been added to the exam schedule. This, he related, was done because of requests from students and faculty
members. George Trask, student body president, said he knew nothing of such a request, and agreed with several others that
extending the examination period was unnecessary and useless. It was pointed out by Dr. Frontis Johnston, dean of the faculty,
that it is customary to begin early in September and end early in May so that “Our commencement will not
conflict with those of other schools.” Hengeveld and Dr. Johnston have both indicated that relief from the problem might be
in sight. They have been discussing the possibility of limiting the summer program to one session, which may mean that
classes could begin later in the fall and continue through the final weeks in May if necessary. The committee, however,
must also consider such protests as those being registered concerning the oddly scheduled two-day semester break (Wednesday and Thursday). It
should be recalled also that only after strong protests did the committee decide not to begin school on New Year's
Day last year.

Really Big Shew
By Bill Godwin

I can see it all now. A blast-off September spectacular for Davidson College, a new “first” for Tarheelia. The props
are here and we’re so close to being put on the map that even a lowly freshman saw the possibilities
of such a production last week as he quizzed advisor Bob Stone about our annual cake race. “Bob,” he asked,
in all seriousness, “will we be able to ride around the course in fraternity cars?” A buddy of his popped
up and wanted to know whether the course would run past Hatties’. These questions from uninformed, yet-to-be-converted Davidsonians. But think
of the possibilities. To date, only Pete Whittle, the track coach, has. He grabs up the first dozen-or-so winners for
his cross-country team. Our 1961 cake race is baking history now. Here’s what could have happened:

The race is scheduled for the Saturday before rush week. Participants are in top physical shape, having taken the PE
qualification tests earlier in the week. Alumni invitations have been mailed and John Horton is pulling all the stops on
radio, television and newspaper publicity. The big day arrives and everyone takes his station. Freshmen have emerged from the gym
in their Greek trotting attire. Busloads of fillies from Queens College have lined the soccer field, forming hip-hedges to funnel
the boys through the pines. Faculty members and their wives, smarting from DAVIDSONIAN criticism of their annual, humdrum reception for
frosh on the College Union lawn, have moved the firing line to Richardson Field and are swatting flies off some
sixty chef's delights prepared by our mothers away from Mother. They know that this reception will be unique in that,
watching the boys perform, they will have something to talk about. Ambitious fraternities have moved up their first rush party
to coincide with the race. Accordingly, they have set up rest stations along the way, complete with propaganda booths, for
weary runners. But the real pick of the crop, they know, will be the winners: three score and more of
the choicest stud runners. The race is on. Despite the excellent training, more than a few runners are panting as
they pass the hedges. The trot becomes a walk for many as they hit the pavement and these are ear
bent by some of the more discerning fraternities, who know that the walkers already are using their heads and will
be valuable at the house long after legwork season is over. Meanwhile, Charlotte’s prettiest have regrouped their forces at the
finish line. Here the winners will be bid off and couples will perform the rites of fall: Someone in the
stadium chuckles, doubtless remembering the assembly line at Burwell Hall, where annually matriculater and matriculateress met and stepped it off
to the dance. The front-running freshmen enter the track for a final loop, stimulated into a last-ditch gallop by thoughts
of a field day later. A field day . . . this is what it could have been.
