Rees 1978

Two points are within the grasp of the Professional Affairs Committee, which is currently considering procedures for hiring and evaluation
of faculty. When the PAC presents final proposals, it can: 1) insure an ongoing professional effort towards building a diverse
and highly-qualified faculty at Davidson, and it can: 2) reaffirm that Davidson upholds the principle of democratic participation in the
governance of an academic institution.

The PAC should present a clear and concise statement of Davidson's philosophy on faculty hiring and evaluation. Such a statement
will give order and purpose to the process of faculty development. Then the PAC should establish an administration/faculty/student Evaluation and
Tenure Committee so that each segment of the College community will have a role in putting that philosophy of faculty
development into action.

To make this statement of philosophy and set up such a Committee, the PAC need only combine the best of
all the proposals it is presently considering. Since Academic Vice President Zimmermann last spring presented to the PAC his first
draft of the proposed Code for Faculty Evaluation, the administration has worked in good faith with the PAC to establish
evaluation guidelines acceptable to all. Worrisome still in the recently-released third draft of the Code is the stipulation that both
the President and Vice President, while interviewing a prospective teacher, should “explore further the relationship between the candidate’s religious position
and personal and career aspirations and the College’s objectives as set forth in the Statement of Purpose and the Code
of Faculty Evaluation Procedures.” This vaguely-defined exploration should be replaced with the clear and simple statements (from the Trustee by-laws)
that a Davidson professor must: a) work “with respect for the Christian tradition even if he cannot conscientiously join it,”
and b) live “in harmony with the purpose of the College as set forth in the Davidson constitution.”

Even with this improvement, however, Zimmermann’s Code is inadequate insurance of professional hiring practices and thorough evaluation of faculty, for
the Code consolidates primary responsibility for all these matters in the hands of the administration. Enter the Evaluation and Tenure
Committee. In evaluation and hiring of faculty, three heads are decidedly better than one. The administration guides the school and
must necessarily influence personnel decisions, but teaching, our main business at Davidson, is done by professors for students, and both
of these groups should bear responsibility in personnel decisions.

A Tenure Committee as proposed this week by the SGA brings the administration, faculty, and students together to make those
decisions. Faculty hiring and evaluation is a difficult matter, and conflict between the parties involved is inevitable. But when all
parties resolve conflicts together, involvement and commitment result. Involvement and commitment of all members of the College community is essential
if Davidson aspires to excellence.

Recommendations to the PAC:

1) Delete from Zimmermann’s Code all sections that consolidate evaluation in the hands of the administration, leaving behind what is,
in essence, Davidson’s philosophy of faculty hiring and development. Touch up that philosophy, removing all hints that Davidson practices religious-based
exclusionism in hiring.

2) Recommend an Evaluation and Tenure Committee to uphold this philosophy and make hiring and evaluation decisions. Consider carefully the
SGA’s proposed Committee, for it takes particular care to insure that each segment of the community—administration, faculty, and students—plays an
active role in this important area of College governance.

Responsible Interpretation

The Trustees and administration of Davidson College have ignored and abused the Davidson College Constitution, and today that document stands
in low esteem, little more than a worthless piece of paper. Any responsible interpretation of the Constitution affirms that radio
station WDAV should be under student control. The President and Vice President, while interviewing a prospective teacher, should “explore further
the relationship between the candidate's religious position and personal and career aspirations and the College's objectives as set forth in
the Statement of Purpose and this Code of Faculty Evaluation Procedures.”

Letter to the Editor

Sound the alarm!

To the Editor:
I am appalled. I have just picked up this week’s Davidsonian and read the latest about the ‘raging battle’ for
control of WDAV. The shocking headline reads “College closes WDAV’s box.”

Where have our rights gone? Before you know it, the college will close all our boxes and read our mail
before we get it. Next they will censor outgoing letters, and then the inevitable will happen—hidden microphones and cameras in
our rooms!

This is one more example of what the Davidsonian terms “creeping professionalism.” It is creeping into our student activities and
insidiously destroying our freedom and rights!

It is obvious to anyone that the “bungling” management of WDAV will improve only if control is returned to students
and the creeping professionals are eliminated. The students in charge should also be careful not to get “chummy” with the
administration.

It is equally obvious that no one enjoys classical music, and if one did, there are hundreds of area stations
that play classical music. Popular music, however, is a different matter. You just can’t find rock on area stations, except
perhaps on Sunday mornings.

Of course WDAV will be of greatest benefit to students if run as a student activity, regardless of the revenue
a public service-oriented college station could generate.

There is hope. The SGA is considering a resolution to restore WDAV’s box. Thank goodness they are finally getting down
to important business.
