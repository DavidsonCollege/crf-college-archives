Untitled

Jasmine tea
enhances the writer

but not her writing, I fear

as each day the stack of virgin paper
grows thicker

Itâ€™s not the time she lacks
not the desk

nor chair

nor pen

not even the inspiration is missing

I think they call it motivation
she whispers

into the steam ringlets of her cup
