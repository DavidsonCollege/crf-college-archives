Davidson basketball for-

locker room at halftime.
Horowitz had 15 of those 31.

The second half started as
the first had, with the Wildcats
taking the early lead. Richmond
was not going to roll over for the Cats.

The tenacious press
trouble all game caused many

turnovers, and with just over

seven minutes left they had
given Richmond the lead 47-46.

Richmond built their lead
from there, and when the Cats
tried to come back, it was too

late.

Greg Dunn led Davidson
with 21 points. Horowitz ended
with 19 points and 15 rebounds,
and Jay Powell added 13
points.

Richmond’s key to success
was constant pressure and
shutting off Davidson’s big
scorers of Powell, Dunn, and
Horowitz. Powell came into
the game shooting over 60 percent
but was only 5-19 in the
game.

Davidson then traveled to
Princeton to play the Tigers.
The Cats had never beaten
Princeton at Princeton, and
that was again to be the case
as the Tigers shut off Davidson’s
scoring punch and
showed some of their own to
win big, 72-56.

Princeton played an extremely
tough man-to-man
defense with special emphasis
on Dunn, Powell, and
Horowitz. This paid off as
Princeton held each player under
his average.

Princeton took the lead midway
through the first half and
never lost it. Early in
the second their lead was
as big as 21 points.

Barnes Hauptfuher was the
main Cat killer as his 8-12 field
goal shooting and 8-8 free-throw
shooting gave him the
game scoring honors with 24.
His 8-12 shooting however
lowered his seasonal percentage
which was 73 going into
the game, including making
his last 17 attempts.

Dunn led Davidson with 16
points while Powell had 14.
Horowitz was held to a mere
five points before fouling out.

Catawba Crushes Cat Grapplers

By MARK SCANDLING
Staff Writer

Davidson suffered a
34-13 defeat at the
hands of Catawba Tuesday
evening. Three nights later,
the team bounced back with a
24-18 victory over the
Livingstone Bears.

Tuesday was the first time
in five years that Catawba had
defeated Davidson.

A well-prepared Catawba
dominated many of the matches.
The Wildcats managed
to win only three out of ten.

Brian Jacobs picked up a
forfeit in the 126 lb. weight
class.

The older half of the Jacobs’
duo, Bob, picked up a superior
decision in the 142 lb. weight
class.

The Wildcats defeated the
Bears 42-15 last year.
Friday’s match was not as
one-sided.

Livingstone bolted to a
quick 3-0 lead, after Mike
Dosal lost 6-4. Brian Jacobs
continued his dominance over
the forfeit clan, as he picked
up his second forfeit in as
many matches.

Glenn Ballard outfought his
opponent for an 8-4 victory,
making the score now Davidson
9, Livingstone 3.

Bob Jacobs fell behind 2-0 in
his match, but then came back
to destroy his opponent. Mark
Scandling won an 8-5 decision,
and Davidson was now on top
15-3.

Ralph Holloway lost his
match at 150. Bob Price was
losing 9-6 when he pinned his
opponent. Price’s come-from-behind
victory gave Davidson
a 21-6 lead.

Livingstone now sent their
studs onto the mat, and it
resulted in two pins.
Livingstone closed the gap to
21-18.

Jack Summe trudged onto
the mat knowing he had to win
to preserve the Davidson victory.
Summe dominated his
opponent. He was close to pinning
his man several times.

With Summe’s decision, the
win was preserved for Davidson,
much to the dislike of the
large Livingstone crowd.

The Wildcat wrestlers now
have until Jan. 17 to prepare
for their next opponent.

Richmond W & M Conquer

The team then traveled to
play William & Mary.

“We realize we have a long,
hard road schedule over
Christmas, and we view the
last several games as a learning
experience.”

--Bo Brickels

This press also caused
many Davidson turnovers.
There were 65 turnovers in the
three games for the Wildcats.
