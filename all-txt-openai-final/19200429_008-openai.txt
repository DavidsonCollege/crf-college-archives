Wake Forest Game With the jinx still following the team, and booting the ball all over the lot, the Wildcats
fell before Barnes’ bends in the second game of the trip, and Wake Forest won by a 3 to 1
score. All four of the Davidson errors resulted in runs for their opponents and the game was literally thrown away.
The Wake Forest runs were scored as follows: Wake Forest scored the first run of the game in the fourth
inning when Ragsdale walked, was sacrificed to third and came home on another sacrifice. In the next inning, a second
tally was made when Wesler hit safely, took second when the second baseman muffed the assist from the pitcher and
scored on another error by the second baseman. In the seventh frame Kesler again scored when he got a fluke
three-base hit by a hot hit over second, bouncing over the center fielder’s head. He then scored immediately on a
wild peg to the infield. Davidson’s lone run was the result of Huffstetler living on an error, advancing to third
on sacrifices and scoring on Shepherd's single. The features of the game were the playing of Kesler and Shepherd. The
former had a perfect day at the bat, hitting safely in three tries. Shepherd secured three hits in four times
up. The box score: Wake Forest. AB R H PO A E Stringfield, ss ---. 4 0 1 1 3

First Elon Game In the final game of the trip the Red and Black aggregation put forth some classy work,
backing Currie splendidly, and the Wildcats came out of the contest with the long end of a 6 to 3
score. “Buck” was in rare form, striking out ten and walking two. Elon gathered in six hits but they were
well scattered and at no time was the result in doubt. Perry, for the losers, pitched a good game, but
the Wildcats bunched hits off of him in a couple of frames, and scored enough to win. The game was
featured by the batting of Cassell. “Eris” secured three hits in five tries, one of them going for a double.
Ratchford put up a good game at second base.Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

101400 up a nifty game at second. The playing of Johnson for the losers featured. The second baseman handled himself
gracefully around the midway sack, taking care of several hard chances. The box score:

Trinity Game
In an uphill fight and a rally in the “lucky seventh,” Trinity snatched an exciting contest from the Wildcats by
a 4 to 3 score. Brown, on the mound for the Methodists, pitched a masterful game, striking out ten of
the opposing batters. The game started off like a big leaguer and for the first three innings no one was
able to cross the plate, although Trinity wasted a chance to score in the first when Salmon missed the hit
and run play and McCarther was run down between third and home. Davidson scored two runs in the fourth on
two singles, a double, and a sacrifice. Trinity got one in the fifth on two singles and a sacrifice.

Summary—Two-base hit: Cassell; three-base hit: Crawford; sacrifice hits: Crawford, Shepard; stolen bases: Shepard, Ratchford; struck out: by Currie 10, by
Perry 6; base on balls: off Currie 2, off Perry 3; left on bases: Davidson 8, Elon 5.

Second Elon Game
Davidson trounced Elon for the second time in the last three days by a score of 3 to 0. This
game was a no-hit affair in which only 27 Elon batters faced Miley. Only one of their men reached first
and that on error, but he was caught trying to steal second. The features of the game were the pitching
and hitting of Miley, who, out of three times at bat, connected with a single, three-bagger, and drew a walk,
thereby making his batting average for the afternoon perfect. “Bill” had the visitors guessing at all stages of the game
and the teamwork and support of the other players was excellent. Although the field was rather slow on account of
a light rain, the game was full of thrills, fast, and cleanly played. The one-handed catch of Wrenn’s liner behind
third base by Marlette, the Elon shortstop, and the double play following was the most sensational piece of fielding of
the whole game. The Wildcats’ batting was hot and heavy for of the six hits collected, two were three-baggers, two
were two-baggers, and two were singles. The Red and Black machine scored as follows: In the fifth inning McArn went
to first on his single and scored on Miley’s three-bagger. Then the squeeze play was worked by Cassell, Miley scoring
the second run. In the eighth frame Crawford went around to the hot corner on a three-bagger and scored on
Shepard’s long hit to left. The box score:
