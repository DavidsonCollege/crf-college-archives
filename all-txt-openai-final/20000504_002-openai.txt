“We should not, however, be complacent. We should always realize that to continue to attract the best faculty and the best students will take effort and time. And we need to nurture an environment that each group will find appealing.”

encountered a situation where a faculty member wanted to stay at Davidson but was leaving for a comparable position at a similar school that was paying more money.” Despite the aggressive efforts to better compensate the faculty, Davidson professors are far from the best paid in the business. A survey published recently in the Chronicle of Higher Education showed that the average assistant (generally entry-level) professor at Davidson pulled in an average of $44,100 in 1999-2000. Professors with similar experience earned $59,000 at Duke, $52,800 at Amherst, $51,600 at Swarthmore, and $47,900 at Wake Forest.

Much of this disparity can be attributed to the size of Davidson’s endowment. Although the fund has grown by leaps and bounds over recent years, Davidson’s war chest (at a little over $300 million) is still meager in comparison with some competitors like Washington & Lee and Williams. Despite Davidson’s 1999 rating of 11th overall, U.S. News ranked the North Carolina college 32nd in financial resources amongst national liberal arts colleges—while schools like Occidental College, rated 40th overall, boast substantially greater financial resources.

What to make of it.

It is important to note that, in spite of some underlying dissatisfactions, most all faculty describe Davidson as a wonderful place to work, teach, live, and study. Every departing professor that spoke with The Davidsonian described his or her experience here as an overwhelmingly positive one. “I really like the Davidson students,” said Dr. Mele. “They’re terrific to teach, but they’re also terrific people.”

Though the loss of any professor is untoward, it should be noted that as many as 200 applicants typically apply for every vacancy on the Davidson faculty. Professors and administrators alike hope to conduct an extensive survey to establish whether Davidson’s departure rate should be a growing concern, or merely an expected fluctuation within a nationwide trend. “The nightmare scenario would be the Milwaukee Brewers Syndrome,” explains Dr. Menkhaus, “where we recruit and develop young faculty only to have the finest ones plucked away by the New York Yankees.” But, backed by all accounts, Dr. Menkhaus notes that Davidson is far from that state. The college remains an intellectual juggernaut at the forefront of its field—continuing to attract and retain some of the finest faculty in the market and comparably talented students.

“We should not, however, be complacent. We should always realize that to continue to attract the best faculty and the best students will take effort and time,” said Dr. Ross. “And we need to nurture an environment that each group will find appealing.”

their families. With entry-level professors making slightly over $40,000 a year, even the most modest homes in increasingly pricey Davidson are out of reach. And living in the quaint community is a major draw for faculty members, especially those with children. “Soon you'll have to be married to a physician in order to afford a house here,” quipped one. In order to help accommodate youngerProfessors, the college owns some houses that non-tenured faculty may rent at affordable rates. But still, some young professors cannot afford to invest in the purchase of a home near the college. While Davidson has made great strides in redressing salary disparities for the college’s faculty, many professors point out that pressing faculty issues extend far beyond dollars and cents. Faculty here describe an immense pride and joy that they derive from working at the prestigious teaching-oriented college. But still, they cite some sacrifices that are made to teach at Davidson, ranging from overwhelming extracurricular demands to a lack of affordable housing near campus. Professors at Davidson must juggle far greater academic and co-curricular demands than their counterparts at some other universities. Most faculty members are required to teach five courses each year—while faculty at research-oriented universities often teach as few as one or two classes a year. Furthermore, Davidson’s emphasis on student-faculty interaction further taxes a professor’s time. Professors are expected to become active members of the community—serving on committees, maintaining extensive office hours, attending an array of campus activities, and advising student organizations. All the while, the changing face of American families has further contributed to the drain on a faculty member’s time. Far fewer professors have a spouse at home to choreograph the intricacies of child-raising and household management. The prevalence of these working families is making old-fashioned Davidson traditions (like staying late on campus and having students over for dinner) increasingly more difficult to fulfill. Says Dr. Rigger, whose husband works as a journalist, “It’s not like we have wives who spend all day fixing the lasagna.” A lack of affordable housing in Davidson is also contributing to a financial squeeze for young professors and research at a liberal arts college. In light of the tremendous demands on faculty time at Davidson, the first thing to suffer is often their own research endeavors. To many professors, prominent research and publishing is still a high priority. “If you’re to be respected in your field,” says Dr. Rigger, “you have to be known by the quality of your research.” And faculty members who forgo their own research often find it increasingly difficult to find future positions should they ever leave Davidson. “Unfortunately, professors with strong teaching credentials but relatively weak research records are generally unmarketable outside the college,” explains Dr. Menkhaus. “Young faculty are not unaware of this fact.” Faculty and administrators alike describe the balance between classroom emphasis and individual research as a constant juggling act—one that is a challenge for all liberal arts colleges that attract top-rated professors. “The quality of the education here is absolutely excellent,” said Ross. “But it is essential that our compensation package to faculty continue to be competitive, because we ask some of the nation’s finest faculty to make a strong commitment to the teaching mission of Davidson College.”
