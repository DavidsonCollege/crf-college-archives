THE DAVIDSONIAN THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 1990

A lot of campus rapes start here.

Whenever there’s drinking or drugs, things can get out of hand.

But you should know that under any circumstances, sex without the other person's consent is considered rape. A felony, punishable by prison. And drinking is no excuse.

That's why, when you party, it's good to know what your limits are.
