VOICE OF THE LOW...

ain’t built a house in four years—he’s working on the railroad track. The boy that sat next to me put
‘No’ on every other sentence and then filled the rest up with ‘Yes.’ He got a swell mark. I read
so slow I only got four done before the time was up. I get so tired bein’ hurried all the
time! Look at ’at—a tree, a fish, a cake of ice. At first it was so funny I tore out
the page and kept it. See, three pictures I'll read what it tells you to do: a tree, a fish,
and a cake of ice. John is ten years old and his sister is eight. If John is not Mary’s
brother draw a line from the fish to the cake of ice. If Mary and John are twins, write your
middle name under the tree; and, if you have no middle name, put zero there. If they are not twins,
print your last name on the tree. If Mary is younger than John, write the Roman number eight in the
upper left-hand of the paper; but, if John is older than Mary, draw a cat in the lower right-hand corner.
If they both go to school, write your full name at the bottom of the paper. I'm never sure just
how to spell my name, so I didn’t even try this one.

“Miss Brown didn’t like it because I always asked a lot of questions, thought I was bein’ fresh, but I
wasn’t. There's a lotta things I want to know about. I never got mad when she asked me questions all
the time. I answered. She was...

of work which, some of them find out to their sorrow, consumes an enormous amount of time. Certainly, the time
and effort they put out is worth some credit hours for upperclassmen and English credit for freshmen and sophomores. One
word more of thanks goes to Jack Etheridge who has been the Davidsonian’s true friend in many ways, and has
kept the welfare of the student body foremost in his varied activities. For the cooperation and support of the student
body, our grateful thanks. It has been a pleasure and privilege to serve as editor of your DAVIDSONIAN. Our parting
hope as we turn our quill over is that...| will continue to improve. To “the Bouncer”? The paper your Dad

I’ve got lots of answers—but they always seem to fit the wrong questions. Anyway, everything's changin’ all the time! So,
what's the use of learnin’ a lotta things today when, maybe, they won't be true by tomorrow? I know a
heap of things Miss Brown don't know—like where to find birds’ nests and how to fix a leaky pipe and
what the baseball scores are. She has to send for the janitor when the lights go out. I can do
lots of things out of a window if I don’t have to read how in books first.

“Sure, I'm glad I’m in the special. I get lots of attention. Seems if you're awful dumb they do a
lot for you in school; but, if you're what they call ‘Normal,’ they just leave you set. I guess—that’s a
man that comes in just before promotion time and tells the teachers why they're not promotin’ us—he told Miss Brown
it was on account of my grandfather and the rest of my ancestors. She said wasn’t it kinda late to
do anything about that now; and he said it was, but I must have the proper training so I'd be
a good ancestor.

“Gosh, I don't want to be no ancestor. I'm gonna be a plumber.”
