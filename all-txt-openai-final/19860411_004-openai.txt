Brown Outlines Alcohol Policy for 1986-87
By LAURIE BALLENGER

Next fall, the legal drinking age for beer and wine will be raised to 21. Throughout the 1985-86 school year,
the Committee on Alcohol Policy, appointed by Dean of Students Will Terry, has worked to propose a new policy. On
Wednesday, committee chairman and Union Director William Brown, along with committee members Lucinda Kellam, Edwin Evans, George Guise, and physics
professor Bob Manning, presented their proposed policy at the union-sponsored Campus Forum Open Luncheon.

Brown first outlined the committee’s concerns as they formulated this policy: 1) that education about the use of alcohol be
a focal point, 2) the policy should recognize students as adults, 3) the policy should guide those intending to sell
or serve alcohol in order to protect both them and the college from litigation, and 4) the policy should be
realistic so as not to force student social life off campus.

After outlining these goals, Brown went on to discuss the policy. The first part resembles the current policy in that
North Carolina alcoholic beverage laws must be complied with in respect to 1) college-sponsored parties for alumni, 2) parties that
are sponsored by the college or its agents on behalf of the college, 3) parties given by resident advisors or
hall counselors, 4) events sponsored by student organizations that are affiliated with the college (i.e., the Union), and 5) any
event that is covered by the college’s ABC license. The policy designates where on campus alcohol may be served and
consumed (dormitories, perimeter and Patterson Court houses, Vail Commons, and in certain areas of the Union and Lake Campus).

Additional restrictions which are included in the present system are: the prohibition of alcoholic beverages from athletic events; any student
activity funds collected by the college may not be used to purchase alcohol for anyone under the legal drinking age;
kegs are prohibited from dorms.

The major change is the following: Patterson Court Council must develop and maintain a policy with regard to serving alcoholic
beverages. The policy that the PCC develops must address the state laws, controlled service of and access to events, service
to minors and to those obviously intoxicated, availability of food and alternative beverages, functions at which prospective members are recruited,
drinking games and drunk driving, and responsibility for damages. The PCC must determine procedures for enforcement of its policy and
provide for and/or participate in alcohol education programs. Three-fourths of Patterson Court houses need to approve the policy annually. For
individual house approval, a two-thirds vote is necessary.

Perimeter houses must formulate their own policies which can be adopted with the approval of two-thirds of house residents. Both
the Patterson Court Policy and the Perimeter Houses’ policies must be submitted to the Dean of Students office for approval
no later than Monday of the last week of spring term.

In conjunction with the Patterson Court policy, the new system will require that all parties where attendance will exceed 30
people must be registered with the Dean of Students office at least three days in advance, and that advertising the
sale or service of alcoholic beverages be prohibited.

After describing the policy, Brown opened the forum for questions. Students questioned the registration policy, asking what would happen if
an unplanned gathering of 15 snowballed into a party? The committee assured them that while these occurrences do happen, every
effort must be made to register a party ahead of time. Students also asked whether there would be a limit
as to how many parties a house could register. The Dean’s office may try to advise a house against having
an excessive number of parties, but it cannot veto a registered party. The question of enforcement is still being discussed
in the Student Conduct Council.

The Committee on Alcohol Policy has spent time formulating this policy utilizing discussions with each other, with the college lawyers,
and with drug counselors. For the proposed policy to be officially adopted, it must be approved by the CCRL, Student
Conduct Council, and President Kuykendall, and then the Board of Trustees.

The provision concerning party registration is not, as committee members Christie Johnson and William Brown pointed out, a response to
Dean Terry’s “Outbasket.” Rather, promoting responsible drinking is the reason behind the changes. Kellam said: “The whole purpose of the
policy is to keep people from driving [off campus] to drink. If Davidson truly cares about its students, then it’s
going to formulate a policy that will keep them safe.”students safe.” Several students asserted that this proposed policy was only
a confirmation of “business as usual.” Brown and the other committee members hastened to disagree, citing that not only must
registration be taken seriously but that Patterson Court must formulate a workable, enforceable policy. The committee has taken the position
that since the students are adults, they must take responsibility for formulating a realistic policy.

Two perimeter houses to close starting next year
By KEITH FINCH

Davidson College has decided to discontinue the use of two of its perimeter houses as student residences. The McConnell House,
located on the east side of North Main Street, will house the Alumni Office after the end of the 1985-86
school year. The house is currently the residence of 14 students. Harding House, also located on Main Street and currently
the home of 11 students, will be used as housing for faculty and staff members next year.

Jennings said that the decision to move administrative offices to the perimeter houses was based to some degree upon a
shortage of space in Chambers for faculty offices and classrooms. He said that the College will eventually eliminate all student
residency in perimeter houses. “We're also trying to phase out perimeter houses because they're expensive to keep up and because
they're fire hazards. The houses are old and a lot of the electrical wiring has, with age, tended to have
problems. Security is also a problem out there because the front doors are rarely locked.”

Jennings said that the decrease in available student housing resulting from the conversion of the perimeter houses has been provided
for. “We picked up two of the college apartments which will house four people each. That will almost make up
for Harding House. We will make triples in Duke suites and Carnegie basement rooms, and we'll pick up another 10
spaces in Cannon and Sentelle dorms by making some of the larger singles into smaller doubles. We'll more than make
up for the perimeter house loss — the trade-off is that it'll be more crowded on campus, and the more
people you put into a room the more potential there is for trouble.”

Jennings said that the college is not planning to sell any perimeter houses, but instead plans to eventually convert all
residential perimeter houses to other uses. He added, “I really can’t see us converting any more perimeter houses until we
come up with a plan for new housing.” Jennings said that he would prefer any new housing to be “apartment
style”: “If we’re able to build new housing in the next few years, my preference would be that we go
to an apartment style option, where perhaps six people would have their own bedrooms adjoining a kitchenette, a dining room,
and a living area. Such an arrangement would give you the option of having a living area that you could
share with whoever you want. That would be a viable replacement for the perimeter houses.” He added, “In terms of
actual dollars on the table, there are currently no plans for new housing.”

Housing Director Tom Jennings said that the decrease in available student housing resulting from the conversion of the perimeter houses
has been provided for. “We picked up two of the college apartments which will house four people each. That will
almost make up for Harding House. We will make triples in Duke suites and Carnegie basement rooms, and we'll pick
up another 10 spaces in Cannon and Sentelle dorms by making some of the larger singles into smaller doubles. We'll
more than make up for the perimeter house loss — the trade-off is that it'll be more crowded on campus,
and the more people you put into a room the more potential there is for trouble.”
