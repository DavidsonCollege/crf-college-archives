### Who Is Georgia Ringle And What Is A Health Educator?
By Catherine Milligan

You may have seen the man on the flyers with mouth agape and hands to cheeks, wearing a wide-eyed look of anxiety. “What would your father say...?” is the beginning message, but in case you’ve been preoccupied and unable to read on, let me explain. The man represents a state of SHOC, a deep concern about health issues that need to be taken seriously at Davidson. Student Health Options and Concerns (SHOC) is the up-and-coming committee that can and will handle that concern. The group wants students to have a solid, reliable source of information and advice about health issues and to know there’s someone to help you resolve potential problems. Right now, that someone is GEORGIA RINGLE.

Georgia is your Health Educator. She’s warm, knowledgeable, and interesting; and she can keep a secret. If you’re nervous, panicked, or even just a little curious about sexual problems, contraception, AIDS testing, alcohol or drugs, diseases, eating disorders, stress, medical exams, or whatever... go talk to her. She can help you answer questions, make decisions, or just relax, and she genuinely wants to help.

To top off her love for her work, Georgia is well-qualified. She began with a B.A. in Developmental Psychology and a Master’s in Public Health from Tulane Medical School. After getting her degree, she worked with handicapped infants and provided their parents with counseling and developmental assessments. When she accepted a job in Health Education at Tulane, Georgia began channeling her interests in individual development into keeping college students aware and healthy.

“My services are very prevention-oriented,” she says. “I think college students are the most beautiful people in society. You're young, energetic, and finally on your own, so it’s very sad when you suddenly have to deal with something traumatic like alcoholism or diseases. The point is to create awareness that you are not immune to these issues. You need to be prepared and think ahead.”

Georgia moved here in 1986 and now works with Davidson’s Physical Education Department, Dean of Students, and Health Services. She teaches a course called “Issues in Personal Health” (which, by the way, meets the Lifetime Sports requirement), and works regular hours in the Student Health Center. She is equally devoted, however, to the private counseling she provides for individual students.

What exactly happens when you want to see Georgia? Well, first you either make an appointment or simply walk into the Health Center on Tuesday (3:45-5:30) or Thursday (4:30-6:00). You may also call her at home if you have a conflict and need to make a personal appointment outside of those times. After that, there’s no right or wrong way to approach your Health Educator in order to get her full attention and insight about whatever health concerns you have.

“In some cases,” Georgia explains, “couples have come in together concerned because they have become sexually active. They’re there to make a decision about contraceptives or testing, so I help them figure out what steps to take and in what order. Other cases may be individuals worried about unsatisfying relationships, stress, fear of pregnancy, vaginal irritation... any or all of these problems.”

Georgia sometimes acts as a go-between for students and medical resources. “Because students may be embarrassed or simply uninformed about which questions to ask, they are often not as vocal to a doctor. I can speak to the doctor for them or get the information myself.”

It would be interesting to get some feedback from students who have already benefited from Georgia’s services. You won’t get their names from her, though, because her personal counseling sessions are completely confidential. This, as well as Georgia’s open-minded approach, is guaranteed so that students can feel comfortable and secure as they discuss their private affairs. She wants to assure the students: “I really try to be non-judgmental, to keep things confidential, and to lead people to good decisions.”

### Rock Climbing Can Roll Your Blues Away
By Win Baatbora

Halfway up a climb I am balanced with my feet on a slight indentation in the rock to figure out my next move. My forearms are burning from keeping my body balanced on the rock by gripping small finger holds—I must think quickly. A seemingly good crevice is about 20 inches out of my reach.

In an effort to answer these questions, I’ve asked some of Davidson’s experienced climbers about the pastime. The physical challenge to overcome the rock is climbing’s attraction for Julian Cochran. A graduate of NOLS (National Outdoor Leadership School), he feels that rock climbing has become a way to test one's limits and abilities.

When climbing, Lee concentrates all of his physical and mental attention on one move and the rock itself. He says that at a certain point, his rationality quits and his doubt is overcome, and he performs above his expectations.and flexibility have been advantages for her. Also, she is attracted to the idea of what she is actually doing: scaling a vertical face of rock. If you are interested in learning to climb, Greg Sheppard, the Davidson Outdoors director, has some suggestions. A good way to get started and meet some climbers is to sign up for some climbing trips offered by Davidson Outdoors. Greg says these trips are geared toward beginners, so no experience is necessary. The image of a rock climber is a bulging, barrel-chested man. However, the best climbers are usually thin, wiry, and flexible. In my training, I’ve been taught that women make the most controlled climbers because of their low point of gravity and generally weaker upper bodies. This requires them to depend on using their feet and balance to maneuver. Although strength is important, good footwork makes the best climbers.

May Martin, also a NOLS instructor, finds that climbing is physical in the involvement between you and the rock, and mental in the involvement between you and yourself.

Recently, talk of rock climbing has become much more prevalent around campus than in past years. Why is this, and what attracts students to this seemingly risky sport? It involves the will to overcome and beyond what he would even consider doing.

The hours are 3-6 p.m. Monday through Friday and 7-9 p.m. Monday through Thursday. For information about climbing locations and the names of other climbers, contact Greg Sheppard at -2623. PLEASE RECYCLE THIS ISSUE OF THE DAVIDSONIAN.

If you want more input, talk to someone who attended the open question-answer session Georgia held at Rusk in late February, which focused on sexual issues and received a great response. The girls wrote questions on index cards, then Georgia drew them out of a hat and led discussions on topics including pregnancy, orgasms, life of sperm and eggs, and Norplant (a new birth control development which can be implanted under the arm). Students were able to voice their interests and get some solid answers, and as Georgia said, “I think we could have gone on forever.” Health education is vital in today’s growing and threatening environment. The best way to take care of yourselves is to ask questions, get informed, and seek help if you think you may need it. Georgia Ringle and SHOC are available resources, ready to help. In order to stay informed, watch for future SHOC-sponsored discussions, talks, and articles, or go see your Health Educator. Georgia’s additional comments to Davidsonian readers: “Stay on hold for more information on Norplant...Be aware that springtime often brings higher risk of rape, pregnancy, drugs, alcohol, and other problems...I’m here! I want people to come see me.”

(Music Review) The Cure: "Mixed" Wrong By Joe Binns

Here’s a little mystery for you ratiocinators: Pete Cobb’s mom called him to ask him what he wanted for his birthday. Pete wasn’t home. I was. Pete’s mom asked me what Pete wanted for his birthday. Now guess what Pete got for his birthday? If your guess was that he got just what I wanted for my birthday but didn’t get, you were right. “Yes ma’am,” I said, “I think Pete would really like the new Cure disk, Mixed Up.” Unfortunately, I didn’t do myself especially right. Pete put up no fight when I went to usurp the thing and I knew something had to be wrong. “It sounds like a rap album,” he spat. And upon listening, I have decided that, for once in his life, Pete was right. Mixed Up is true to the Jules Renard quote in its cover, “Look for the ridiculous in everything.” See "MIXED" on Page 10.
