Computers jumble schedules
Registration starts over after Registrar's Office discovered system errors
By Mary Laura Moretz
Staff Writer

When pre-med senior Emily Davis filled out her schedule tree to register for spring classes, she wrote down a lot of the courses she needed to finish out her history major, including two seminars. A week later, when she picked up her completed schedule, she was surprised to see nothing on her schedule except ... horseback riding?!?

“I just laughed,” says Davis of the schedule mix-up. She was one of hundreds of students with similarly raised eyebrows last week after the computerized registration system went down, leaving a number of schedules mixed up, blank, or full of randomly selected classes.

The Banner software used by many of Davidson’s administrative offices has been through four successful registrations since the Registrar’s Office began using it. The problem last week occurred when the system went down and automatically restarted. During the restarting, data for many schedules got lost or confused.

Registrar Polly Griffin says the problem went unnoticed at first. The staff saw that “about 1,400 students got schedules with three or four classes and thought it must have been successful.” It was only in the next few days, when students flocked to the Registrar’s Office to ask questions, that Griffin realized what had happened. At first, she thought the problem might have stemmed from student error in filling out the forms, but then “we started seeing sheets we could not explain.”

“They were very helpful,” says Davis of the staff’s response to the large number of problems. Junior Clair Freeman, who heads the Council on Academic Affairs, informed the SGA last week that Griffin and her staff “have been very sympathetic towards seniors who need classes to graduate” and everyone else who has had a scheduling problem. Within just a few days, Griffin and the staff

Cosmic Coffee to land soon in Davidson

The long-awaited Cosmic Coffee House is set to land on Main Street within a couple of weeks, according to owner Nancy Gray. Gray, who purchased the space for the coffee house with her husband Edward, anticipates the store will open in 10 to 15 days. Delayed construction has made both townspeople and students anxious for the shop’s opening according to Gray.

The Grays are experienced in operating a coffee shop, as they already own a Cosmic Coffee House in Blowing Rock. They plan to model Davidson’s coffee house on their original, where they even roast their own 27 varieties of coffee. According to Gray, their Cosmic Coffee has been so successful in the mountains that they sell it to five different fine-dining establishments.

Gray anticipates that their new European-style coffee shop will “be a gathering place” which will enhance “Davidson’s already unique environment.” She plans to sell homemade muffins, bagels, danishes, and sandwiches from 8-10 on weekdays and 8-12 on weekends.

At Cosmic Coffee in Blowing Rock, the Grays host live entertainment on weekends, and organize monthly art shows featuring local artists. They hope to institute both at Davidson’s Cosmic Coffee House. In the past, they have hired bands heard on WNCW, a public radio station in the North Carolina mountains. Performers at their coffee house have included Doubting Thomas and the Layman’s Daughter.Decided to re-run the batch processes for selecting schedules, leaving all previous schedules invalid. The new completed schedules should be available sometime this week. Faculty, staff, and community members who attended the Habitat for Humanity rally.

Graduation. Kurt Holmes suggested the presence of alcohol in post-graduation activities only increased the risk of damage to college housing and property. With negotiations of the subcommittee complete, Hamlin pronounced that RLO “will proceed with a plan to allow seniors the option of staying over Sunday night.” In addition to Sunday’s standard checkout (2-5 p.m.), the new policy allows seniors a Monday morning checkout from 9 a.m. to noon. Accordingly, failure to check out by the Sunday 5 p.m. deadline will force seniors to stay overnight and check out by 12 p.m. Monday morning. Failure to check out by noon on Monday will result in a $35 late fee. To combat the possibility of vandalism, security will be increased, and RLO will not accept party registrations for Sunday night. Holmes felt it unnecessary to allow large-scale partying both Saturday and Sunday night and therefore denied petitions for Sunday night gatherings. Although the alcohol policy will be waived Saturday night, RLO expects adherence to the policy Sunday night and encouraged small parties, contained within apartments, to prevent raucous behavior. In granting special privileges to seniors, RLO expects the senior class to treat the new policy with respect and responsibility according to the Davidson code of honor and integrity.

### Retraction

In the November 13 issue of The Davidsonian, the article on page 2 entitled “Knox wins sixth mayoral term” and attributed to Matthew Eirich was in fact a reprint of an article by Pat Borden Gubbins from the November 8 Charlotte Observer. We apologize for the mistake.

### Habitat rally unites humanity

By Robert Ramsay, Executive Editor

Instead of eating dinner at the Commons or at Patterson Court houses last Thursday, the students of Davidson College, along with administration and faculty members, ate some barbecue in Johnston Gym. The Habitat House Committee organized the rally in order to laud the efforts of the many people who worked on the Habitat House fundraising and awareness-raising project. According to sophomore Cooper Dean, “the idea was to cancel dinner at the Commons and Court houses in order to get as many students as possible to attend.” The Habitat House Committee expected 1200 students to show, but attendance only reached about 700. However, the event was still a “successful venture,” says Dean. “We were pleased with the turnout; not just students, but faculty as well.” President John Kuykendall opened the rally with a short speech, followed by a speedy statement from SGA President Bill Gullan. Jane Cain, the local director of Habitat for Humanity, addressed the bleachers and told how building houses for others is addictive. “I’m hooked,” she said. After Cain, the owner of a recently built Habitat house expressed her gratitude to Cain and the Habitat program, priming the crowd for Chaplain Rob Spach’s speech.
