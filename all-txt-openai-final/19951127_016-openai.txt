One for the ages? Senior-led team has shot at glory this season

By Matt Pitzer

Men’s basketball coach Bob McKillop can tick off a list of accomplishments within the reach of the Wildcats and their five seniors this season, ranging from being the first class to graduate without a losing season since the 1970-71 freshmen to being the first NCAA-tournament team since 1986. And he realizes those seniors will step onto the court for the first regular-season game against Rhodes with not only those visions in mind, but also with the goal of erasing last season’s disappointing 14-13 record and first-round loss in the Southern Conference tournament.

“This is the year” is the popular refrain being heard around much of campus for the Wildcats and the senior class of starters Chris Alpert, Jeff Anderson, Brandon Williams, and Quinn Harwood, and last year’s backup center Mark McGuire. This could be the year Davidson finally puts all the pieces together and culminates a process that started in 1992-93 with a .500 record and continued in March 1994 with a bid to the National Invitation Tournament. And based on preseason predictions, including those from several college basketball magazines and the conference’s preseason media and coaches polls, the Wildcats should return to being the class of the Southern Conference.

“[The seniors] realize they have been a part of the resurgence of the program,” McKillop said. “There are a number of challenges out there for this group... They realize what they were a part of as sophomores, and they realize it is attainable again. They will not leave a rock unturned in trying to reach those goals.”

Williams, the 6’6” forward from Collinston, La., will again be leading the charge for Davidson as he hopes to recover from a disappointing junior season. A preseason all-conference pick last year and potential candidate for conference Player of the Year, Williams was...

Just tell me who’s No. 1!
By Matt Pitzer, Sports Editor

It’s a question that sometimes annoys basketball coaches and fans, sometimes frustrates them, and probably sometimes does both. It’s that question about who’s going to be the best team in the Southern Conference this season, and it certainly isn’t an easy one to answer.

Marshall has — count ‘em — 10 new players, but challenged Davidson for the top spot in the North Division in both the coaches and media preseason polls. Tennessee-Chattanooga has only five players coming back, including two starters, but also lists 10 newcomers on its preseason roster. Yet the Moccasins were the runaway pick to win the South Division in both polls. What’s going on here? How can these teams be so highly regarded when we hardly know what to expect from them?

A good deal of it has to do with the Southern Conference being one of those middle-of-the-road leagues. While it is no longer one of the premier conferences in the country, it is certainly not one of the weaklings. Which means teams might get some really good freshmen who slip through the cracks or somebody who is a marginal Division I prospect that turns into a complete bust. It also means schools get a lot of transfers. When someone doesn’t see the playing time at an ACC or Big East school, he might transfer to a Marshall or East Tennessee St. And those players who want a year or two of junior college time before hitting Division I would shoot for a league on the level of the Southern Conference if they’re not good enough for a top 10 team.

“Our conference is very inconsistent from year to year in terms of the roster,” Davidson coach Bob McKillop says. “It’s not your typical player that’s part of the freshman class. With all the JuCo players and everyone else, there’s a different degree of player coming into the conference.”

With all that in mind (and maybe we can use it as an excuse when we turn out to be wrong), here are The Davidsonian’s picks for the Southern Conference with teams’ projected records in parentheses.

NORTH DIVISION
1. Davidson (25-1, 14-0 in conference): A slight letdown after beating Michigan in Vegas would be forgivable.
2. Appalachian State (16-10, 9-5): Chad McClendon’s gone, but Clemson, Georgia Tech, UNCC, Wake Forest and maybe Indiana are still on the schedule.
3. East Tennessee State (18-8, 8-6): We’re more optimistic about the Bucs than most. One magazine said they “won’t be big, but they’ll be quick and, eventually, tough.” Could be a prescription for disaster, but they play Wofford twice, Lees-McRae, and Carson-Newman.
4. Marshall (12-14, 6-8): Coach Billy Donovan quits when referees remind him his team actually has to inbound the ball after the other squad makes a basket and that, no, they can’t just
