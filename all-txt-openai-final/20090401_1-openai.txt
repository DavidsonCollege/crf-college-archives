Many have debated whether
Stephen Curry will remain at Da-
vidson for his senior year or enter
the NBA draft. But in an unan-
ticipated change of events Monday
night, Curry admitted that, for the
time being, he will do neither.

Rather than compete on cam-
pus or in the NBA, he will serve in
a year-long position as one of two
key representatives for “Basketball,
Books and Beyond,” a Charlotte-
based philanthropic organization
founded by former Davidson bas-
ketball player, Chris Clunie '06.
By deferring his decision, Curry
has stated he will have more time
to reflect on future career decisions
while also devoting himself to serv-
ing the community.

Curry released a statement say-
ing, “I understand that this comes as
a surprise and that many might be
confused about my decision. How-
ever, I’m confident that my time at
‘Basketball, Books, and Beyond’
will be both rewarding in terms
of service, but it will also give me
time to truly weigh my options for
the future. I truly do appreciate all
the messages and support through-
out this process.”

In its mission statement “Bas-
ketball, Books and Beyond,” aims
to “nurture young minds and bod-
ies through encouraging healthy
lifestyles based in both sports and

academics.” The organization ca-
ters to children between the ages of
five and 12, with most of the learn-
ing taking place off the court.

The idea grew out of Clunie’s
Watson Fellowship, a $28,000 grant
he was awarded to study basketball
as the catalyst for change in com-
munities throughout the world.

Although Basketball, Books,
and Beyond currently serves 250
children and young adults in the
greater Charlotte area, Curry and
Clunie have set a goal of expand-
ing the organization to five addi-
tional states.

“I'd also love to see us go
abroad with the organization by
2012. With all his international ex-
perience, maybe Coach McKillop
could help us find some good con-
tacts overseas,” Clunie joked.

When phoned for his take on the
matter, McKillop was reflective.

“Even though this chapter has
come to a close, the book is not yet
finished,” he said. “Steph will have
the option of red-shirting next year,
making him eligible to play during
the following season.

“Even if he does decide to leave
us after his time with Basketball,
Books, and Beyond, let’s not dwell
on what we would lose, but rather
appreciate what we’ve gained
through Steph’s phenomenal lead-
ership and ability.”

Virus Hits Library; Carrels Must Be Vacated

ANDREW HILL
Staff Writer

Due to a highly unusual out-
break of Hantavirus, all carrels
in the E.H. Library must be va-
cated by Thursday at 5:00 p.m.
for sterilization. Head of Library
Circulation Jean Coates says that
the virus most likely spread from
rodent excrement in the library’s
basement. In addition to vacating
all carrels, students are also asked
to return any books that have been
stored in those carrels in the past
six months.

Library Archivist Jan Blodgett
maintains that the library has al-
ways met sanitation requirements
in the past and that the Hantavirus
outbreak is unprecedented in the
history of the E.H. Little Library.
There is a possibility that when the
library was renovated last year, new
carpet was laid over a floor strewn
with infected feces.

“This was a complete shock,”
Blodgett said. “We strive to pro-
vide students with a healthy and
comfortable study environment.”

Thus far six students with car-
rels in the basement have com-
plained to the Health Center of
maladies symptomatic of Hantavi-
rus. Any student with a carrel in
the basement is strongly encour-
aged to have a routine check-up
from a Health Center staff member.
Though the virus is not spread be-
tween humans, contaminated dust
may be encountered in certain ar-
eas of the Stacks sections.

Hantavirus has a two-week in-
cubation period before symptoms
start to appear. Those symptoms
include fever, chills, malaise, head-
ache, nausea, abdominal and back
pain, and gastro-intestinal prob-
lems. Latter phases of viral infec-
tion are characterized by renal fail-
ure and, in extreme cases, death.
Rodent exterminators will be
canvassing the library’s basement
from Friday at 9:00 a.m. to 5:00
p.m. The library staff is currently
trying to assess whether the rat in-
festation has spread to the first and
second floor, but asks students to
vacate carrels on those floors as a
precautionary measure.

Due to an infestation of Hantavirus carrels like this one must be
emptied by Thursday. Library officials say rat droppings were the
primary cause of the outbreak.
