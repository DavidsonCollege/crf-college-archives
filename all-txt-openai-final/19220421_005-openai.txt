THE DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 21, 1921.

A Patriotic Girl.
Red hair. White teeth. Blue eyes.

Don’t ever count your chickens before your roommate.

The Secrets of Success.
“Push,” said the button.
“Make light of everything,” said the match.
“Stick to it,” said the glue.
“Never be led,” said the pencil.
“Be up-to-date,” said the calendar.
“Take pains,” said the window.
“Let’s stick together,” said the three flies as they lit on tanglefoot.

A wild lunch—animal crackers.

Sears Roebuck, Montgomery Ward, or the Baltimore Bargain House catalogs haven’t any difficulties at all. Just look at the new Davidson College catalog.

A college paper is an ideal invention—
The college gets all the fame,
The printers get all the money
And the staff gets all the blame.

Pests.
An 8:30 class.
Six unexcused absences,
Students who ask questions just as the whistle blows.

Life says, the present day “flapper” can dress on $66.33 if she only dresses her hair.

Why doesn’t the faculty add a course in cow punching for the Juniors to major in?

Tears there were in the potatoes’ eyes,
The celery hung its head—
Sadness reigned in the pantry that night,
For the mother of vinegar was dead.

Get a Barrel.
Here lies the remains of Jimmie Polk;
He thought red phosphorus was a joke,
He put it in his jeans by chance,
And blew the bottom out his pants.

Navigation.
Bitzer—How you like my new shoes?
Barr—They’d be alright if you had a good looking girl to break a bottle of champagne over them.

How Sad.
Vampish vestal virgin beguiles guileless Gamble.

It Wasn’t the Commissary.
Bishop entered his room late one night last week, just as the lights went out. “Darn that wood alcohol,” he said.

There were several contributions made to the “Mighty Hoag” gallery of famous students this week. Among them were Sam Story, Hunky McLeod, Rolston Bitzer, and Spratt Moore.

Blythesome Bob.
It is rumored on the campus that a very prominent Senior from first floor Watts has formed an entangling alliance with a blythesome young lady. What about it, Bob?

Pat Miller certainly has quite an attractive personality—even the wild and wooly grizzly bears are strangely attracted by him.

Heard In Chemistry Lab.
Fresh McGregor—“How much does a gram of magnesium weigh?”

The Height of Hard Luck.
Last Saturday morning Fresh Moss was heard asking a prominent lady of the town how much an engagement ring would cost. Saturday night Fresh Moss was observed on his bicycle headed for Queens. It has been found out later that his girl had gone home for Easter and he did not get to see her at all. He returned to Davidson Monday sorely downcast. Cheer up, Moss.

A MERRY DRAMA
ACT II—The Reckoning.
Scene: The same room, third floor Georgia, Lack. The time: 9:15 a.m., and thereabouts. “Mack” Lennox is lolling lazily in the rocking-chair; he puffs a Camel held in one of those “see you next weeks,” a smile overspreads his handsome (?) face. Apparently he is content with the world and the inhabitants thereof.

Enter “Bill” Carroll, his roommate.
C.—Well, how's Mary?
L.—Sweet as a peach. One in a thousand!
C.—Though she’s spilt the beans?
L.—She might have, but if she did she picked ’em up, let those lovely eyes of hers them a bit—and lad—they’re just peaches and cream. Bill, why don’t you—
C.—Wait a week—hold steady! None of your moralizing on what I should do—did you stop at Mellon’s?
L.—Did I? (Points to pile of bundles on table) I’ll say I did. He's got some line too—niftiest I ever saw. Here let’s see (opens bundle)
C.—Why so many shirts? You must be going into competition with Ikey Morris.
L.—Nope—such good things I couldn’t resist. See that white one! The one with the attached collar; well it was only two fifty. Those—
C.—They look good to me.
L.—Those blue pin-stripes werethree-fifty—some nifty garment for your old Uncle Ned, eh—had some for three but thought that I’d try these.
C.—What’s in that little bundle?
L.—Wait and see. (He opens bundle.) Ain’t they pippins?
C.—I'll say they are—you ain’t quite gonna strut your stuff. What’s the dope?
L.—They’re new, the latest out; just hit Broadway last week—fancy open-knit ties—if they aren’t snappy French is a crip.
C.—The tax?
L.—Two bones and four bits—Berkely make—and say boy, ain’t they the stuff? (Adv.) (Continued next week.)
