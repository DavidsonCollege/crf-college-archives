**Catharsis**

I lie in solemn time to trace the shadows
It's going on, but not for long.

I saw you when you were found
With a letter with my name between your fingers
And you cried and said goodbye without a sound.

I wasn't close enough to hear your final call
Though I always felt that you were somewhere nearby
A presence draped in light and grace.

**Turtle Crossing the Road**

The odds of a turtle successfully crossing
the New Jersey Turnpike are somewhat
infinitesimal, especially where there are
twelve lanes, six in each direction.

It is not that New Jersey drivers are
as sadistic as their faces might suggest.
Their angled jaws and burrowed eyes only
mirror the greased glass of sad refineries.

They are not used to life on the road—
a blown tire perhaps, a green Army boot,
but a turtle poking his head cautiously
into the path of a big rig?

Into overdrive? A stupid
attempt to set the record on "Secor American Animals"?
A turtle going for Guinness? One lane
he’d make maybe, or two or three,

but all the way would take an act of God.
“Look Archie, a little turtle on the road,”
says Edith sweetly. “For Christ’s sake,” says Archie,
“Everyone knows turtles don’t grow in Jersey.”
