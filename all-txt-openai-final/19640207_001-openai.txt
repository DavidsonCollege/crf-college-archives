For nearly 800 volumes have been missing from the college library over the past two years, the Student Council learned Monday night as it faced the increasing problem

**Student Council Explores Thefts Of Library Books**

**BY JOHN TODD**

of books being taken—not borrowed—from the library. The situation came to the council's attention after the Christmas holidays, during which time dormitory rooms were searched for missing books. According to Student Body President John Spratt, “a sizeable number” of the missing books turned up in students’ rooms. He told the council that some of the volumes that were found had been missing from the library for more than two years.

Letters were sent to the students in whose rooms the missing books were located. The recipients of the letters were asked to return the books and pay a dollar fine; however, instead of being turned in at the circulation desk, some of the volumes suddenly re-appeared on the shelves of the library. The matter is now in the hands of the Dean of Students, Spratt said; however, he told the council, “I'd sort of like to see us handle this to show that we're responsible.”

The council seemed to be against any “strong” action against those who were found to possess the missing books. “But it might take something stringent, though, to get the point across,” Spratt observed.

The library problem dominated the discussion for more than half of the hour that the council met; however, no definite decision was reached. Stemming from discussion of the library, the idea of a “Campus Community Code” was mentioned by Spratt. Such a code, he said, would incorporate all the rules which govern campus activities, instead of having a different set of regulations for the library, gymnasium, dormitories, and other areas. The council agreed that many regulations are misunderstood and that students are not aware of other existing rules. A committee composed of Will Jackson, Bruce Swain, John Barrow, and Arnie Snider will look into the idea of such a code for Davidson. Spratt mentioned that he had material from the National Student Association on the idea also.

Tommy Stafford, freshman advisor, told the council to be thinking about revising the Freshmen Regulations. “I think we definitely need to change them,” Stafford stated. Freshmen Council President Tom Frist said that his group had also discussed some changes.

Spratt then suggested that the council encourage Davidson students to write their Congressional representatives in support of the Civil Rights and tax-reform bills. He said that he had been approached by a member of the Davidson Civil Rights group about such an idea. Dave Hardeman said that the council had received much literature from NSA on the Civil Rights bill and that such information could be used in this project. The council approved of using NSA material, but they were leery of “collaborating” with the Civil Rights group in promoting the letter-writing campaign; they voted unanimously against the latter idea.

Before adjourning, Spratt mentioned two other ideas. One was a self-study by the Student Council. “This could be a complete farce or a lot of fun,” Spratt admitted. “The Student Council can definitely do much more than they are doing now. Ever since the Honor Court was divorced from the Student Council, it has been uncertain what the Student Council was supposed to do,” he added.

Finally, publishing a list of establishments in the town of Davidson that have integrated their facilities was suggested by Spratt. “I think we ought to recognize these businesses uptown that have taken this step,” he stated. The council decided to investigate such an idea, thinking such recognition might adversely affect the businesses. Some places have already lost patronage because of the change in their former policies.

**ODK Questionnaire Goes To Seniors**

For the past several weeks the Delta Circle of Omicron Delta Kappa Fraternity has been compiling a questionnaire dealing with the strengths and weaknesses of the academic life of Davidson. The questionnaire will be distributed to the seniors only. It will examine the curriculum and the academic facilities available at Davidson. These questionnaires will be distributed personally by the members of ODK to the entire senior class at a date that will be announced later by Joe Howell, chairman of the Delta Circle. The results of the questionnaire will be compiled and analyzed by the members of ODK and presented to the Trustees within the spring.

**Group Will Oversee Controversial Talks**

**BY HARRY CARR**

To supervise the policy of the college and of student groups for inviting controversial speakers to the campus, President D. Grier Martin has appointed a committee of three faculty members and two students. The committee members are Dean of the Faculty Frontis Johnston, Chaplain Will Terry, Professor John Kelton, and John Spratt and Will Jackson, president and second vice-president of the student council, respectively.

Included in the policy are three major points. First, “no speaker shall be denied a hearing on the campus because of his membership in any organization.” The policy further states that the committee may, however, prefer certain members in an organization to others. Another provision in the statement explains the obligation of the committee “when a speaker is brought to the campus representing a highly controversial viewpoint... to see that the other side of the issue is presented within a reasonable length of time.” Finally, the policy grants the committee the power to remove assembly attendance requirements, “when an unusually controversial individual is to speak.”

Although the request is not a part of the policy, President Martin wants the committee to avoid scheduling a night appearance when a speaker might attract a large crowd from outside the college. In making the request, he pointed out that Davidson lacks a police force to protect adequately the speaker and the audience, and to discourage “unfortunate behavior.” According to Chaplain Will Terry, the committee recognizes that the word “controversial” is not easy to interpret. Therefore, the committee requests that any member of the college contact the group before an invitation is sent to a speaker.

**Basie, Campus Security and Weekend Scrutiny**

**COP AND RANGER**

Two things should be said before I try to assess the arguments that each of these gentlemen presented. First, the actual issues of the question of the existence of God were never made more clear. As often happens in a discussion of this sort, the real issues are pushed to the rear and are covered by a barrage of nebulous, unrelated, and usually irrelevant points. Tuesday night was a brilliant example of how it is possible for a discussion of this nature to occur without getting absurdly out of the ballpark.

Second, it is usually admitted that a discussion between a scientific philosopher, e.g., a logical positivist or a member of the analytic school, and a Christian theologian, is likely to be not only overwhelmingly futile, but probably very dry. This is admitted because usually the initial assumptions that each of the men start with are so radically different that there is no common ground from which to launch a fertile discussion. No agreement is ever possible, because neither wish to grant the other's assumptions, and more often than not, the theologian has not done his homework in logic, linguistic analysis, and perhaps modern philosophy.

One expects, then, and usually gets a pathetic discussion between a philosopher who throws the logical ball to the theologian, and who, in return, not only refuses to take his turn at bat, but is perfectly willing to allow the ball to roll dead behind home plate. However, and this is probably more to the credit of Dr. MacCormac in particular, and to the college in general, than most people have realized: Dr. MacCormac is a fine example of a theologian-philosopher who has done his homework, and who has done it well.

Dr. Scriven’s presentation was both general, in an inductive sense, and necessarily particular. His thesis, that the meaningfulness of belief must be supported by evidence, and that if one feels he has a “private pipeline to Truth,” then he must establish a reliable procedure for validating such a pipeline, was a proper one.

**IN EVANGELICAL FASHION**

**BY PAT FREENY**

To be more specific, “one’s belief in God,” said Scriven, “is no more sophisticated than a young child's belief in Santa Claus, if there is no reliable evidence to support such a belief to make one willing to bet heavily on the existence of God.” (This last statement does not mean to exclude the possibility that some adults believe in Santa Claus.)

Scriven's classical example was the green dragon in the next room, which no one seemed to believe in, probably because dragons are mythical and no one has ever been able to produce any reliable proof of having seen a green dragon. But to say that God exists, or is in the next room, is equally stupid, because no one has ever seen God, and those who make such claims to religious knowledge and revelation are never able to produce any reliable evidence for their claim. Scriven intimated rather bluntly that the “looney bins” are full of a great many of this type of person who claims he is Jesus Christ, or Napoleon, or George Washington. In fact, he seemed quite right when he said that the argument from religious experience is fallacious since it presupposes the existence or the knowledge of such experience in the first place, and, therefore, is no criterion for validation.

Second, there is the claim made by Dr. MacCormac that God, Who is beyond man, is a paradox. Our language is not explicit when we talk about God. Thus, when one questions the love or the intelligence of God, as Scriven does, he must realize that the love and intelligence of God exist in a different realm, the spiritual realm. God need not snatch small children from beneath street cars and not snatch gangsters away, nor need He be able to executeelementary arithmetic calculations. His love and intelligence are “beyond man.” The scientific evidence that Scriven is looking for is not applicable to the spiritual or infinite realm. We cannot measure God's love and intelligence with a yardstick that man defines. When we talk about God, we do so symbolically and paradoxically, and this involves, I believe, a sort of transcendent leap of faith. MacCormac felt that (1) man was responsible for the evil in the world, not God. God made man free to choose; (2) Scriven cannot limit reality, as he does, merely to the spatio-temporal world. There is another reality beyond the temporal “in which God reveals Himself paradoxically.” What one has when he tries to talk about God is a “metaphysical symbolism which points toward a truth which he is trying to get at.” Scriven would allow neither of these points. “It may be that God has made man free to act and choose as he wills, but this does not free God, who is all-powerful, from His responsibility for allowing small children to be run down. God could have intervened.” One just cannot escape this situation. Second, to say that God is inexplicable and that our language is symbolic is to “throw the baby out with the bath water.” Scriven says, “If one believes that God exists and describes Him as good, powerful, and so forth, then one may look for evidence of such a benevolent creature. If He is inexplicable, then one should quit trying to describe Him, because when the first shred of evidence is presented for such a belief, the inexplicable has been described.” This is a violent contradiction of terms.

An Atheist Shakes Foundation

It seemed unusual to find Chamber’s auditorium filled to capacity on a Tuesday night. But what was even more remarkable was that the apathetically defined Davidson crowd was gathered to hear two highly intelligent philosophers discuss the ancient question of the existence of God. They were not, as one student remarked, “Just some other hillbilly holy-rollers about to roll in the aisles of Chambers.” In fact, as everyone expected, Dr. Earl MacCormac, with an exceptional understanding of both the arguments for the existence of God and of the traditional attacks made against such an existence by scientific philosophers, was a good match—considering “what he had to work with”—for the polished, Oxford-trained philosopher from the University of Indiana, Dr. Michael Scriven.

Finally, Scriven said that he did not wish to restrict reality to the empirical world, nor perception to the five or six senses. “But if you want to show that you have perceived something (God), then you must prove that you have not merely made an error of conceptualism. God's existence may well enjoy the status of immateriality, but He must interact with the world and one must say something meaningful about how He knows of this interaction.” The position of MacCormac could not make sense when talking about God. His language did not include those words which were capable of unambiguously bridging the gap between infinite and finite. In MacCormac’s favor came one point which finally demonstrated that he had done his homework and indicated a deviation from the theological mumbo-jumbo words of “paradox,” “transcendence,” “faith,” and “wholly Other” which Davidson students are tired of hearing in compulsory ‘Sunday School’ classes. That point was that Scriven was actually lacking in a validating procedure himself. Scriven defined the presentation of scientific and empirical evidence as the criterion for belief. But when he was asked about the validity of such a procedure, he was forced to do that which his procedure would not allow: namely, to go outside of his realm for validation. It was obvious that Scriven was trapped. However, there is still some doubt about the meaningfulness of such an attack. Nevertheless, though it is a point well made, probably the best that MacCormac had, it seemed like a last resort to attack from this direction. It seems that religion, belief in the existence of God, is really only a question of faith and which rules one is willing to allow when this game of faith is played. The best point that Scriven made was that it is a game, and when one bets a lot, he should do so only in the face of good evidence, and not on the word of the kid down the street. There can be no genuine safety in numbers: gross acceptance means nothing, “if it did, the world would still be flat” and chemists would be experimenting with phlogiston.

Blondes Weekend Social-Minded ’Cats Search Cool Escapes

BY GREG GOVAN

It is Midwinters, again, and another weekend for Davidson to travel the yellow brick road to its own version of the Emerald City. While there may be no Wizard at the end, the IFC has provided a (very) few scarecrows, tin men, and lions along the way, and the whole thing may well start with a twister. A weekend traditionally begins with the dedicated CORE (Committee On Radical Enjoyment) meeting at Mrs. Morgan's, which features ballistics problems involving empty cans and Southern Railway freight trains. For the more inhibited, Midwinters begins with basketball. Dates and students, crammed into one side of the gym, for the third straight Wildcat triple-figure win, over Georgia Southern. After the game, there will be a coffee hour in the Union to discuss the theological aspects of victory. For variety, Chambers Banquet Hall will host Addie, Doris, Shirley, and Beverly, corporately known as the Shirelles, who will probably lead one to conclude that “love is a swinging thing.” Oh yes, the IFC did have something for Saturday. Count Basie will play somewhere in Chambers auditorium at 3 p.m. Students are warned to queue up early, as many townspeople are under the impression that the Mount Holly Recorder Choir is still under contract, and large crowds are expected.

The winter minds of Davidson have been properly stirred for something. Thanks to a liberal first Vespers and the YMCA forum, plus extra-curricular reading in Time, most everyone sees that morals and the old desert god of wrath and vengeance behind them are not what they used to be. This doesn't mean it will be an amoral weekend, but at least students know someone cares that the cloth of a Davidson gentleman may be a bit too tight, and that makes wearing it a little easier. And it is just possible some few may wonder about a basis for all the falderal for enjoying themselves, now that it cannot be rebellion. This weekend will be, to a large extent, left up to individual devices, a difficult thing for which to blame others. And the freshmen are liberated at last from Greek Week, that venerable disruption of schedules which proves indeed the upper classes have the collective upper hand. Freedom is something of a keynote for this Midwinters to be filled with more contrasts than a typical Davidson argument. The usually effective and precise movements of the basketball team will be countered in a host of shouting twisting enthusiasts at after-parties. And Count Basie, something of a grand old man of music, will serve as a foil to the modern derriere guarde of unsophisticated swing. The students, and the girls, are somewhat more like Davidson winters: cool. With little to recommend their staying on campus, an exodus to nearby pleasure domes seems likely; if the beach is too cold, and the mountains too foreboding, there are always the indoor sports. An expanded forecast might read, generally cool and wet, with occasional rising temperature.

Winter at Davidson can be a singularly uninteresting phenomenon. It is with a great deal of accidental wisdom that the repetitious season is broken into tolerable segments by Christmas, semester break, and Midwinters. The first two send students to explore winter at home or on ski slopes; in the Piedmont, in Davidson, the season remains without justifying extremes, and for many, the most that can be said about it is that spring will follow eventually. Midwinters, the students remain, in a manner of speaking, and momentarily forget about the meteorological foes from the north that never quite come. Of the three weekends, this is the one of escape; it has nothing to do with Le Sacre du printemps and its spontaneous activity, nothing to do with people coming back to where others are beginning the life they have finished.

Winter is the season of sleep, a Sunday afternoon of the months in which to gather strength and boredom enough to face the cycle again. And it is impossible to completely hate anything asleep, so that winter may be oddly beautiful at times, even without snow and ice, but just in the fact of repose. And if a few hundred students unlimber their minds from winter's slow drag, it means little to a thousand leaves that fell last autumn and will mulch the ground for next spring's green. The circle rounds again, so that the most which may be said is that for a while they wildly escaped.

ROTC Announces Cadet Commanders

The mid-year change of command was effected in the Davidson ROTC contingent at drill Tuesday. In addition, three juniors were tapped for Scabbard and Blade as part of ceremonies. Replacing Cadet Corps Commander Tommy Stafford was Haynes Kelly, who will lead the ROTC Corps during the second semester. Cadet Colonel Kelly, like Stafford, was chosen for the leadership position on the basis of his performance in the Davidson ROTC program and his record at Fort Bragg this past summer. While at Fort Bragg, Kelly was selected as the “outstanding cadet in A Company,” the highest award received by a Davidson student at camp. Assisting Kelly in leadership positions will be Lt. Col. Mickey Faulconer, the new staff and company commanders. The staff includes Cadet Majors Charlie Shapard—S1, Bill Dole—S2, Larry Baucom—S3, Tarby Bryant—S4, and Cadet 1st Lt. Fred Schoen. Company commanders are Cadet Captains Hugh Martin, John Spratt, Sid Moore, Jimmy Killebrew, Steve Chiles, and Greg Govan. Cadet 1st Lt. Walt McNairy is Honor Guard Commander. Inducted into Scabbard and Blade were MS III cadets Sam Grimes, Tom Cobb, and Buddy DuBose.
