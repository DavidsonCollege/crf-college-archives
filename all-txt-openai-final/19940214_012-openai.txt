**Valentine's & Davidson Romance**

By Katy Moore

Another year has passed and Valentine's Day has inevitably arrived. Some look forward to a day dedicated to romance and others dread being surrounded by pink and red hearts. As couples across the country exchange cards and candy, the question arises: How many people here will be receiving roses from their Davidson valentines?

There seems to be growing campus concern about the dating situation at Davidson. Letters written to The Davidsonian on the subject express the concern that dating at Davidson is virtually non-existent and male/female relations have been reduced to drunken, and often anonymous, one-night stands.

In her letter to the editor printed on January 31, senior Katey Hines outlined what she has learned about Davidson's dating situation through an "informal survey." She attributed Davidson's "weird social habits" to miscommunication. She argued that both men and women on campus would like to date, but no one is willing to take the initiative. Essentially, Hines suggested that women hang up the "stale tradition" of waiting for the phone to ring and start asking men out.

In another letter printed last semester, Fred Campagne pinned the problem on the age-old double standard: girls who hook up a lot are "sluts," guys who hook up are "studs" or, if it's really bad, "scammers." Her insight raises new questions: Why would Davidson men take the time and effort to get to know the women they take home from parties when there will always be another party, another girl? Are Davidson women asking too much from men who enjoy spontaneous, no-strings-attached hookups?

But are we making generalizations that only guys enjoy these one-night stands? Whether the problem lies in miscommunication or in one sex's denial that there even is a problem is difficult to tell. Dr. Dewitt Crosby of the counseling center, however, says that many students and professors have approached her and expressed their discontent with Davidson's dating scene. The center has even gone so far as to organize a Dating Forum this week to talk about dating and hooking up.

Why the need for a forum? "There is something uniquely odd about dating at Davidson," says Crosby. The forum will give men and women a chance to share their perspectives. Is the dating scene on this campus really "unique"? Is Davidson really "notorious for its weird social habits," as Katey Hines indicates in her letter? If so, is the problem a recent one, and what is its source? The questions are endless and the answers vague, but there is certainly room for argument and speculation.

ON ICE
A Union and SGA sponsored dance was held Saturday in the 900 Room for all students. The "Dancing on Ice" party was a part of the Midwinters weekend festivities.

By Katherine Hash
Students will let down their guard and confront issues with the help of a screen, a mechanized voice distorter, and a secret selection process at a discussion sponsored by Counseling Services in the 900 Room on Wednesday, February 16 at 8 p.m. Dr. David Staton, Director of the Davidson Counseling Center, and his colleagues recognized that the feelings which students express in a confidential setting could be beneficial to others. Students in counseling sessions have repeatedly expressed concerns that there is not a good vehicle for dating, that sexual inactivity in males is considered unmasculine, and that there is no balance between casual and serious dating at Davidson. The Counseling Center staff believes that increased dialogue on these and other dating issues could improve understanding between the sexes. The panel intends to facilitate this dialogue, and an effort has been made to create a low-risk setting, allowing students to speak without fear of ridicule.

Panel to address campus dating
Panel members will express their thoughts. Then the audience will address the panel either verbally or anonymously on question sheets. After the question and answer period, Don and Meg Kimmel will mediate an open discussion. Three male and three female students will serve as an anonymous panel. Counseling services selected the panel through interviews with students known by the counseling staff or recommended by other students. According to Staton, the students were selected for the panel because they are “articulate and inclined to talk,” and because they reflect various points of view—dating seriously and casually, dating on-campus and off-campus, or not dating at all. Dr. Staton is the only one who knows the identity of the panel members. Anonymity will be retained after Wednesday by the members who have pledged not to identify themselves. Staton says, “The panel could be really interesting or it could be a turkey—that depends on how much students are willing to open up, but we’ve decided to invest our time to try to pull it off.”
