**The Davidsonian / Friday, April 22, 1983**

**Spencer Gives Last Address**

Davidson College President Samuel Spencer gave his last formal address to the College at Spring Convocation on April 15. The following are excerpts from his talk concerning his view on the new athletic complex and self-selection.

**Athletics**

Because much of the public tends to think of a college in terms of the other institutions with which it is associated in sports events, Davidson is unfortunate in not having within a reasonable geographical radius a nearby group of colleges of similar size, standards, and objectives such as the college conferences of the East and the Mid-West. This has made the problem of athletic policy at Davidson a persistent one for as long as I can remember. Plans for the new Sports Center have brought the matter back into the forefront of campus discussion.

The way the editor of The Davidsonian dealt with the Sports Center a week or so ago pleased me for two reasons. One was the literary reference to Xanadu, Kublai Khan’s “stately pleasure dome,” where “twice five miles of fertile ground with walls and towers were girdled round,” for that conjured up fond memories of Henry Tracy Lilly and romantic poetry in Room 305 of this building. More important, the editor was raising appropriate questions about the new Center and its relationship to athletic policy.

That there is a need for a new Sports Center few seem to disagree. But how large should it be and what features should it include? Let me emphasize the fact that though the “program book” describing the facility has been put together, even preliminary plans have not been drawn, to say nothing of working drawings. What is contemplated is a phased construction program which will permit building of the core and basketball arena initially, with a new pool and multipurpose area to follow later. The basic support system would therefore be built if and when money eventually becomes available for a swimming facility and the multipurpose area which would eventually replace Johnston Gym’s upper floor as phase three. Meanwhile, the upper floor of Johnston would continue as a useful facility well into the future, thus relieving the most serious space problem we have.

The concern over a suggested seating of 5,000 in the basketball arena is, in my opinion, legitimate but based on unwarranted fears. What will be built is space, space for use by students which could be used for movable seating if the occasion demands it. There is no thought of a coliseum-type arrangement of 5,000 permanent seats. Thus providing the space does not commit the college irrevocably to any particular policy, but leaves the options open for the long-range future.

Then what about the amount of space? What about the size and nature of this project? Are we indeed talking about a Xanadu? I believe that a serious look at the program book and a comparison with the facilities of other institutions — not the big-time athletic powers but the best liberal arts colleges with which we want to be compared — would indicate that the answer is no. It is obvious that space needs are very different today with coeducation and the growth of recreational sports — especially if we are to provide adequately for women’s athletics and give more than lip service to equality of treatment.

As we move toward actual building plans there are three principles to consider. First, just as we would not want a library building or an arts or science facility to be inferior to those at similar institutions, so we would not want our sports facility to be poor in comparison. Second, our total facilities for sports, outdoor as well as indoor, should emphasize balance and give special attention to intramurals and carryover or lifelong sports as well as for men’s and women’s varsity athletics. Third, and this is the fundamental principle that applies to the planning of all physical facilities, a college must build not for the present but for the future. That is why all of our general use buildings of the recent past — library, science facilities, Commons — are designed to accommodate the needs of a possible future student body of at least 1600. Similarly, we must plan the Sports Center not for 1985 or 1990, but for the years well into the twenty-first century. Who can doubt that Chambers Building, now still useful after more than fifty years and moving hale and hardy into a second half-century, must have seemed a Xanadu to many in our 1920s college of 30 faculty and 500 students.

**Self-Selection**

The second issue, that is the subject of much campus talk, is the social system of the campus, a very important element in a college community committed to the idea that the educational experience extends well beyond the classroom. Specifically, I want to talk about a matter of considerable controversy this spring, that of Patterson Court and self-selection.

First, a bit of history as to how we came to our present position. Until the 70s, 85% of all incoming freshmen pledged the twelve national fraternities on Patterson Court. For the 85% it seemed to be a great experience, for they reveled in the parties, the intramural rivalries on the athletic field, the annual interfraternity sing, and the big dance weekends run by the Interfraternity Council. All of these were exciting, and the feeling of “belonging” was a boost to the ego of those who did belong. It was great fun. But it was not much fun for the 15% — the six or seven...— who found the Post Office boxes empty on the day bids went out. Devastated, they returned to the dorm to wonder why. For some, it was the end of the Davidson experience, for they transferred as soon as the year was over. Others sought compensation in other activities and experiences, but never forgot the bitter experience of being branded as personally unacceptable. Increasingly uncomfortable about the kind of exclusivism which produced such trauma for some of its students, the college sought an alternative in the self-selection system on the Princeton model, especially since students themselves, from within the favored majority as well as outside it, began to question a pattern which was so destructive to some of their friends. The discomfort was further exacerbated by the reluctance of many nationals to allow local chapters to accept minority members. National fraternities were offered the opportunity to retain college-owned houses on Patterson Court if they were genuinely willing to operate on the college's terms. A number of the nationals felt that they could not, and gave up their houses. The ones that now remain agreed that they could and would operate under the new plan.

Let me stop here to say that I am talking specifically about the Davidson situation, not about fraternities in general. Fraternities and sororities can play an important role at large institutions where students need the close identification with a smaller group, where the majority of students do not belong to any fraternity or sorority, and where it is therefore a matter of genuine indifference as to whether a student joins or not. Here at Davidson, fraternities have done many good things and continue to do so. But two things make Davidson different. One is the nature of the campus, small, residential with a cohesive, close-knit community which fosters a centralized and homogeneous pattern of campus and social life. The second is selectivity in admissions. All Davidson students are painstakingly chosen not only for academic promise but for personal qualities, and chosen by a far more reliable process than that of fraternity selection. The high quality of the Davidson student body makes this college a very inviting field for national fraternities, accounting for the exceptionally large percentage of fraternity membership under the old system.

Allowing national fraternities to remain under the self-selection system was admittedly a compromise. Many said that it would not work with fraternities present, and urged that the nationals be eliminated from the campus altogether. But because the move was not directed at fraternities per se, the prevailing sentiment was to make the accommodation that would allow them to remain. Consequently, the college accepted in good faith the assurances given by the remaining chapters that they would accept without objection any student who chose to join their groups. I do not blame their successors for the current situation; rather, the college administration ought to have been more watchful in seeing that we did not drift back toward the exclusivism that we had abandoned. Currently, because human beings are attracted by the ego boost inherent in being chosen by an exclusive group, the growing exclusivism of the fraternities is steadily undermining the non-exclusive Patterson Court houses, and the system which began with a pattern of equality on Patterson Court is now very unequal indeed.

In such a situation, colleges are tempted to look for compromise. Unfortunately, the compromise being discussed — the so-called two-tier system in which some groups have formal bidding and others not — in my view is merely a stepping stone toward the old system. I am convinced, to paraphrase Lincoln, that this campus cannot exist half exclusive and half non-exclusive. Large institutions can; this college, with its close-knit campus of high-quality students, cannot. National fraternities are understandably waiting in the wings for the opportunity to return to Davidson under a formal bid system, and sororities would not be far behind. In my judgment, if formal bidding is reinstituted or the current informal bidding continued unchecked, we will revert within a few short years to the situation we rejected.

I am still convinced that self-selection can work with fraternities present on the basis of honesty and good faith all around, but only if the fraternities want it to work. If that is judged to be impossible, then I would give up fraternities altogether. This is a solution I would choose with reluctance, for I know the strong feelings that many Davidson alumni and students have about their fraternity experience. But I cannot in good conscience find justification for college support of a system under which students are undeservedly damaged.

I am of course aware of the basic argument that justified the old system: this is the way life is; human beings are not really equal; the world is not kind and is full of disappointments, and the sooner that lesson is learned the better. But though repeated many times, this argument always comes from those who had the good fortune to be chosen, rarely if ever from those who were not. My bottom line point is this: no eighteen-year-old Davidson freshman, having been selected as a superior person from among hundreds of applicants, should then be subjected to a rejection which says in a devastating way that something is wrong with him or her as a human being. For the college to allow that to happen to any of its students is to abdicate its responsibility. What we had under the old system was a campus divided into first and second class citizens. In my opinion, it would be a sad regression to start back in that direction.
