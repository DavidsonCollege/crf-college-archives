**ALL IN ONE ACT**
By JAMES BERRY & Matt Foree

When Davidson College offers a taste of the theater arts, it’s a time to drop whatever you’re doing and go.
The one acts are especially convenient for several reasons. First, if you’re a child of the MTV generation, the plays
aren’t very long and are bound to hold your attention. Second, it’s less than Movies at the Lake. Third, you
get to watch the hard work of your fellow students pay off. And in the black box, you get to
see theater in its rawest form.

Josh Gaffga directed two of David Ives’ ten-minute plays, “English Made Simple” and “Sure Thing.” In the first, Nick Paul
played Bill, and Heather Larson played Jill. The play is set at a party where Bill and Jill meet and
interact. But the play doesn’t follow a standard plot. It’s more like multiple choice. The Voice, played by Catherine Sauls,
narrates various situations, exploring Bill and Jill’s relationship which changes every two minutes or so. First, we see them as
though they had just met. In a different scenario, they’ve had a relationship prior to the party and look to
rekindle it. One of the funniest situations arises when Bill and Jill’s prior relationship ended in spite, and their bitter
reactions illustrate this.

“Sure Thing” works along the same lines. Set at a coffee shop, Betty (Catherine Sauls) sits alone reading a novel.
Jack (Nick Paul) enters and asks, “Is this seat taken?” Depending on Betty’s response and Jack’s reaction, the play follows
the progression of these characters’ relationship. A bell rings off stage to mark every new attempt at a connection. The
show climaxes with the realization that they’re compatible and they exit to a life of love and companionship. Both plays
were incredibly acted with only the barest of sets.

In “The Rats” by Agatha Christie, we watch a mystery unfold. Sandra (Jessica Robblee) and David (John Hollan) are having
an affair. Jennifer (Jennifer Neale) suspects them when she finds both at a friend’s house—a friend that has recently left
the country—though the two swear they were invited to a party. When Jennifer leaves them, she is replaced by Alec
(Jimmy Lloyd) who secretly set up the phony party because he knows that Sandra killed her first husband and wants
to trap them, like rats, until the police (Matt Nixon) arrive. Though the story is complex, the actors did a
great job of building the tension with the help of director Cyndy Marion. And how about those English accents?

David Ives returns with “The Universal Language,” directed by Adriana Arcia. When Dawn (Addie Rowlson-Hall) responds to an ad offering
a class in the Universal Language, she meets Don (Josh Roberts), teacher extraordinaire. Speaking a string of nonsense, Don walks
Dawn through the basics until, within minutes, she can speak it on her own. Though Don later admits that the
whole language is just a con, the play examines how people express themselves and understand one another.and Don find their
connection in the words, and when a woman (Kay Walraven) enters to ask about learning the Universal Language, the two
offer their services together. The dialogue in this play, most of it nonsense phrases, must have been a challenge to
learn, but the performance was impressively smooth and relaxed.

In “Women and Wallace” by Jonathan Marc Sherman and directed by Bobby Ramsay, we watch Wallace (Vic Brand) at various
stages in life, trying to deal with all

Serenading the spring
Davidson Choir sings a springtime concert in DCPC
By KAREN MILHOLLAND

As the sun set on a beautiful afternoon last Friday, the voices of the Davidson College Concert Choir rang through
the air. The choir performed their 1996 Spring Concert to a rapt audience at the Davidson College Presbyterian Church. The
program notes explained that the program contained a juxtaposition of English and American music; “two nations linked by a common
historical past” with different composition styles. The first two pieces showed immediately the striking comparison between the two types of
music. Opening with Hark I Hear the Harps Eternal, the choir captured the essence of the South through Alice Parker’s
arrangement of a traditional southern hymn. In contrast, the second selection, Almighty and Everlasting God, displayed the traditional seventeenth-century style
of music found in the Anglican church.

Dr. Di Grazia took a few minutes to recognize and thank the ten senior choir members before proceeding to one
of the highlights of the performance, the premiere of Diane Krause’s Logos. A sophomore music major, Krause wrote that in
her first choral composition she sought to understand both the “light and darkness” found in John 1:1-5 and 14. The
haunting melody of this work artfully depicted the mystery of those few verses.

The Chamber Singers continued the theme of the evening with the works of both English and American artists. The challenges
of the music were faced with apparent ease by these musicians. The contrasting dynamics of the third movement of Copeland’s
Four Motets were especially striking. The conclusion of the concert with the Chichester Psalms added a third dimension to the
contrasts of the night. Commissioned by the British, American composer Leonard Bernstein presented a work written in the Hebrew language.
As we are told by the first words of the text, this music awakens the audience with its fast tempo
and wonderful percussion accompaniment. The second movement began with the peaceful, innocent voices of two young male sopranos singing the
twenty-third psalm, only to be interrupted by the stormy rumbling of adult male voices and drums. The third movement of
this energetic piece ended the evening on a restful note as the music calmed down and the voices subsided to
almost a whisper.

The many soloists and instrumental accompanists all contributed greatly to the overall effect of the performance. The concert was awarded
with a well-deserved standing ovation. The text of two of the works called for people to “make a joyful noise,”
and the audience witnessed the fulfillment of those words.
