JOY OF EATING

Inland Calabash hooks fish ‘heads’

By ROBERT ENRIGHT
Staff Writer

Having always lived by the maxim that nothing surpasses good seafood, the numerous stories about the legendary Calabash never ceased
to capture my attention.

When I heard of the opening of the new Thomas of Calabash in Kannapolis (an offshoot of the original on
the coast), I naturally jumped at the chance to sample its fare at a more convenient locale.

That was last spring, and represented the first of many subsequent trips to this hideaway in the pines. Having thus
qualified myself as somewhat of a regular, feel free to take my advice without the usual grain of salt.

Honestly, though, this place deserves a note of commendation (not condemnation as is usually the case).

When considered alongside other restaurants of similar orientation, I would give it a rating of 7½ on a scale of
10—losing ½ point for the obnoxiously sweet nature of the tea, and 2 points for the fact that they don’t
serve alcoholic beverages, necessitating my drinking the tea in the first place. (Dessert is not offered either, a note for
those whose tastes are so inclined.)

However, they do a very fine job of providing seafood of good quality in large quantity and at fairly reasonable
prices.

One would be hard-pressed to consume more than their large platter offers, unless, of course, one had gotten lost on
the way, which is quite possible.

The selection consists of shrimp, either fried or boiled, scallops, clams, oysters, crab, plus the usual bland fish offered at
such places.

Platters, either large or small, are available for anything listed, or in various combinations of two or three. (Be sure
to read the small print concerning what's available in combinations. The scallops are omitted, much to my chagrin.)

I’ve never been disposed to actually count the pieces of each item provided, but rest assured that the number is
adequate, even with the small platter. Of course, the usual side-helpings of French fries and slaw come with the meal,
plus a salad and some truly fine hush-puppies.

Both approximately five dollars, the difference between small and large platters is only about 50 or 75 cents.

Shrimp and oyster cocktails, along with oyster stew and clam chowder are also available as extras. The cocktails in particular
are quite good, but the price is somewhat prohibitive.

Service is quick, never taking more than ten minutes to receive an order, yet the atmosphere is fairly relaxed, almost
cozy, and the decor quite attractive.

Having made three excursions to the real Calabash (eating at Dockside and the Original) since my first encounter with its
kin in Kannapolis, I suppose comparisons are in order.

On that point, the latter stands quite favorably. While lacking the charm of the native Low Country surroundings enjoyed by
the coastal Calabash, its service is superior, and on most occasions the food also.

Without seeking to dampen anyone’s enthusiasm, I must concede that even the best-fried seafood is no match for the unadorned
variety. Though this establishment cannot be so criticized, it seems a perfect shame to bury a shrimp or oyster under
a pound of heavy batter. It’s no good for the shellfish, and doesn’t do much for one’s ulcers, either.

For those trying to find Thomas of Calabash for the first time, be forewarned. It’s best to carry a compass,
and don’t go in the dark.

Take Highway 73 to the I-85 interchange and head north to the first exit. Proceed north along US 29 toward
Kannapolis until reaching Center Grove Road (by K-Mart), turn right and go several miles until you reach Camp Julia Road
where you take a left. Another mile or so and a right turn on Hilton Lake Road. The restaurant is
on your right about a half-mile up the road.
