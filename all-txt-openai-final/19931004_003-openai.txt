#### Students question role of police
By Mandy Curtis & Katherine Hash

After multiple clashes between students and police at Women's Weekend, questions are arising about the officers’ role. According to the
Police Monitor Duties for 1993-1994, “The Police Officer, with the assistance of the Risk Manager, will ensure that the Sober
Monitors are completing their duties. Any problems will be brought to the attention of the Monitor to be corrected. If
the problem is not corrected, the sponsoring organization(s) will be issued an alcohol citation.”

As stated in the duty description for the police officers, “Even while employed as a college monitor, the Officer is
an Official representative of the Campus Police Department and shall conform with the requirements of that position. At any point,
if State, County, or Local Law conflicts with the stated policy, the Officer shall defer to the Law.”

Campus Police reported that only two alcohol violations were given to students at the Dave Matthews concert. These students were
passing cups of beer to those who were not 21. Warner Hall Social Chairs Heather Galano and Cindy Ebbs thought
that the police were “unnecessarily” aggressive in enforcement. Galano said that the police should be there to “monitor the party
and not the alcohol.”

“There were no problems, no one got out of hand; it was just crowded,” stated Galano. She believes there was
no need for the police officers to be so strict.

According to Patterson Court Adviser Kurt Holmes, there were no major problems the night of the Dave Matthews concert. He
recalled a few alcohol violations, but nothing too out of the ordinary for an all-campus party in the center of
the court.

Campus Police has not seen the problems that some students believe to be there. The officers feel that there is
a better relationship between students and officers this year as a result of the changed alcohol policy on campus. However,
some students “still do not understand that the policy still puts officers in the position to act if need be,”
according to Rick Moore, head of the campus police department.

#### Rowdy Frat Guys
Davidson alum finds relationship between "keg-friendly" fraternities and testosterone levels
By Mandy Curtis

“Rowdy and rambunctious” college fraternity brothers have higher levels of testosterone than those guys in the “better behaved” Greek fraternity
houses, according to recent psychological studies conducted by Davidson alum, James M. Dabbs Jr.

Through research and scientific testing, Dabbs has found that the fraternity brothers of three “partying” houses have a higher average
testosterone level than the brothers of two “responsible” houses. Dabbs, class of '59 and a psychology professor at Georgia State
University in Atlanta, has studied the hormone testosterone and its link to aggression in human behavior for years. He has
found, in looking at fraternities, that there is a correlation between the levels of testosterone and the actions of the
members of the houses.

A campus interfraternity council, at an anonymous college, helped Dabbs to identify five different fraternities with various stereotypes. Two of
the five were labeled at the “goody-goody” end and three were known to be “keg-friendly,” according to the August 23
report from USA Today.

Dabbs took testosterone samples from 100 brothers in the five different Greek houses. The average level of the male hormone
was higher in those houses that held an average of 33 parties in the previous year, versus 10.5 for the
"responsible" ones. Those brothers in the fraternities with three times as many parties in the last year were also reported
to have lower grade point averages, and they were less likely to be smiling in their yearbook picture.

According to Dabbs, the low testosterone level fraternities were more likely to have friendly facial expressions, good grades, community service
awards, and leadership qualities.

The reason for looking at the testosterone levels of guys in fraternities is especially interesting to Dabbs. Evidence from the
testosterone testing proves that the stereotypes of fraternities do not precede the actions; the stereotypes are the result of the
actions.

Dabbs has studied the testosterone levels contained in the saliva of prisoners, doctors, ministers, actors, construction workers, chess players, lawyers,
military veterans, two chimpanzees, and college students. His intentions are to examine the correlation between testosterone levels and aggressive, anti-social
behavior.

Testosterone affects people’s actions through the brain; receptors in the brain are signaled by testosterone and the behavior is the
result. The hormone can trigger people to lose patience and control. Dabbs and his associates believe that the levels of
testosterone establish the main differences between men and women. Although testosterone is usually assumed to be the hormone of men,
women also have testosterone in smaller quantities compared to men.

Dabbs' next endeavors may include looking at the testosterone levels of women of sororities as well as the girlfriends of
fraternity brothers. According to Dabbs, he is interested in “testosterone and the temper of the group.” Dabbs admits that his
studies in psychology have advanced since...his days at Davidson cleaning up after rats in the psychology labs. He says, “Davidson
is a very peaceful place." He adds, "It is a very improbable origin from which one would go on to
study testosterone.” However, he is grateful to his undergraduate work that sparked his interest in the study of human behavior.

International festivities heighten
By Court McBryde

Twenty-four countries established themselves in the Union on October 2nd from 11 a.m. until 3 p.m. as Davidson College students
transformed the Union into an International Festival.

The 1993 International Festival welcomed all students, faculty, and community. The Union sponsored this event and provided necessary money for
the creation of each country’s booth. The International Committee of the Union planned and directed the event to show the
cultural and social part of the international scene. Each booth was represented by at least one Davidson student from that
country. The displays occupied two floors of the Union: the Morrison Room, Europe; Big Screen Room, Latin America/Australia; the Conference
Room, Africa; and the 900 Room, Asia. Students talked about their countries to visitors while they explained the features of
their booths.

Books, maps, pictures, artifacts, clothing, money, art, and music were just some of the highlights found on display from particular
countries. However, a main attraction of most booths was food. Most countries had prepared a popular dish from their country.
In addition to the food found at the booths, the Cafe hosted an International Buffet Lunch with egg rolls, stir
fry vegetables and shrimp, pepper steak, and baklava.

A highlight of the International Festival was the dance performances in the 900 Room. Two international dances were performed: "On
A Raga Tip" and "Sechaba." This festival also included activities for children. Davidson students painted faces with international flags and
made buttons with a person’s name written in a different language. Dev, a native from India, said this festival has
been going on every year she has been at Davidson and before that too. “It is a time to bring
international students together and give a taste to America of what our culture is about and share with others where
we come from, but most importantly to share a few moments of cultural diversity,” Dev explained.

Next semester there will be an event with a similar theme called “International Night” which will encompass stage performances from
various countries.

International Student Association gives students a voice and a community
By Wendy Lee

With the creation of the new International Student Association (ISA), international students, who have been at Davidson for over 30
years, will now have an organized body to voice their opinions to Residence Life, Registrar, Dean of Students, Financial Aid,
Admissions, SGA, and other campus organizations. ISA seeks to improve the quality of the Davidson experience for international students, strengthen
interaction between internationals and the rest of the Davidson College community, and promote global awareness.

The SGA unanimously approved ISA’s charter. This means that ISA can apply for much-needed funds from the Activities Tax Council.
Key areas of interest for ISA are: housing for internationals during Christmas, an international student career network, orientation for internationals,
and obtaining a van for internationals to use for transportation to and from the airport and for emergencies.

Internationals are automatically members of ISA, yet membership is open to any Davidson student. ISA founding president Don Jayasinghe said
that the primary purpose of the association is “to act as a support group for international students, yet we are
open to anyone who supports interaction between internationals and Americans.” Other officers of ISA are: Vice President Devjani Dev, Secretary
Li Lin Lee, Treasurer Jorge Thiermann, Senior Representative Jorge Pardo, Junior Representative Ranjit Narayanan, Sophomore Representative Krista Tihanyi, Freshman Representative
Dahlia Sherif, One-Year Student Representative Slav Brisuick. Ruth Pittard, Assistant Dean for international students, is the staff adviser, and Dr.
Alberto Hernandez is the faculty advisor. The Chair of the International Committee, Katrina O’Neil, will serve as an ex-officio to
ensure coordination and cooperation between the two organizations.

Jayasinghe claims that the International Committee does an excellent job celebrating cultural diversity through programs and acting as a support
group or a representative body for international students. ISA was created to fill that vacuum. ISA also hopes to implement
an International big brother/big sister program and begin an International Newsletter. Association meetings are every Friday at 3:30 in the
Union Conference Room.
