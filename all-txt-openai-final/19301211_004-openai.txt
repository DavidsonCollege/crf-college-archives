Davidson Alumni Residing In Chattanooga, Nashville, Louisville Hold Meetings

Forty-Eight Former Students of Davidson Gathered Together to Listen to Address and Discuss Their Alma Mater

LOUISVILLE LARGEST

Captain Pritchett Also Spoke at Preparatory Schools—Personal Interviews Were Held

Forty-eight Davidson College alumni, residing in and near Chattanooga, Nashville, and Louisville, last week had their first opportunity, since the establishment of the alumni office in 1926, of listening to visitors directly from the college. The tour witnessed the establishment of two additional alumni chapters, and the meeting again of a third group.

Captain Norton G. Pritchett, professor of physical education, and Ernest Milton, alumni secretary, were the Davidson representatives. Each spoke at all of the gatherings, touching upon practically every phase of the college. After their talks, the meetings were thrown open for a general discussion, in which the alumni showed their interest by asking numerous questions. One question usually led to another bearing upon the same subject.

The Louisville chapter offered the largest delegation of the trio. Eighteen Davidson men assembled at the Hotel Seelbach for a dinner. The Nashville group had 16 alumni for their dinner at the Hotel Franklin, while Chattanooga had 14 for a luncheon at the Hotel Patten. Toastmasters for the affairs were Dr. J. L. Fowle, ’18, Chattanooga; R. E. Kell, ’29, Nashville, and Rev. R. M. Pegram, ’11, Louisville.

Both the Chattanooga and Nashville assemblies were held on the same day. Chattanooga authorities advised that more alumni were able to attend a luncheon, and a change was immediately made in the itinerary to conform to this, and to set the Nashville dinner for Tuesday night, instead of the first suggested date of Wednesday. These were on Tuesday, December 2, and the Louisville chapter met on Thursday, December 4.

Elsewhere on this page will be found a list of the alumni attending the meetings, and also a list of the officers chosen. Nashville and Chattanooga were unorganized until this trip, but after some discussion, each voted to perfect an organization. The Louisville chapter has been in existence for several years, and new officers were chosen at the dinner.

In addition to speaking at all of these places, Captain Pritchett appeared before the student bodies of McCallie School and Battleground Academy. His general theme was the testing period for preparatory students who have just closed an exciting football season. Interviews were also had with prospective students.

Alumni Deaths

T. G. Coltrane, ’26

Thomas Gay Coltrane, 1926 graduate of Davidson College, was found dead in Concord at 4:15 a.m. Wednesday, December 3, death having apparently resulted from a fall and exposure. This was the verdict of a coroner’s jury which investigated his death. Mr. Coltrane was last seen at 12:15 a.m. When found, he had abrasions on the forehead, nose, and left knee. It was at first thought that he was unconscious, but it was soon learned that he had been dead for some time.

After graduating from Davidson, Mr. Coltrane became connected with the Concord National Bank, with which concern he was working at the time of his untimely death. He had taken a leading role in the life of his native city, and was at one time president of the Merchants and Manufacturers Club of that city.

Births

Mr. V. S. Westmoreland, ’25, and Mrs. Westmoreland, of Kirkwood Avenue, Charlotte, announce the birth of a son, Victor Sloan, Jr., December 4.

Alumni Personals

Henry Alan Johnston, ’03, is the author of a book recently published by MacMillan entitled, “What Rights Are Left.” It is a valuable analysis of the Volstead Act, setting forth what the law prohibits, as well as what it permits. Mr. Johnston is a member of the law firm of Gibboney, Johnston & Flynn, 49 Wall St., New York, N. Y.

Alumni visiting Davidson last week for the purpose of being inducted into Phi Beta Kappa were Dr. H. S. Turner, ’13, Staunton, Va.; Prof. W. W. Morton, ’09, Lexington, Va., and Dr. W. H. Mills, ’92, Clemson College. Major Harlee Morrison, ’16, of Dallas, Texas, and T. R. McNeill, ’16, of Niagara Falls, who were also elected, were unable to attend this initiation.

Other alumni visitors at Davidson were J. B. Meacham, ’01, of Birmingham, Ala., and R. D. Hall, ’19, of Belmont. Numerous alumni have been visiting in Davidson this week for the purpose of hearing the Otts lectures, being delivered by Dr. Harris E. Kirk, of Baltimore, Md.

E. L. Gaither, ’73, and Mrs. Gaither, of Mocksville, on December 1 celebrated their golden wedding anniversary.

Rev. B. F. Yandle, ’17, has been elected vice-president of the Charlotte Ministerial Association. At their meeting this week, Dr. Thomas W. Lingle, ’93, of the Davidson faculty, spoke to the group.

Dr. J. M. C. Covington, ’25, now connected with the Navy Dispensary Yard Hospital at Portsmouth, Va., has been granted a license, without an examination, topractice in North Carolina. Dr. R. W. Spicer, '09, of Goldsboro, has been elected a delegate to the State Medical Society, representing the Wayne County Medical Society. R. E. Kell and W. M. Regen, both of the class of 1929, coached a championship prep school football team this past year. Battleground Academy, at which they are teaching and coaching, in Franklin, Tenn., won the Tennessee title. Hugh M. Grey, ’18, who recently transferred from Bristol, Tenn., to Fort Payne, Ala., saw in a Chattanooga paper a notice of the alumni luncheon there on December 14, called up and made reservations and drove 115 miles the next day to meet with the other alumni.

It is an interesting observation that 31 of the 48 Davidson alumni attending the series of meetings in Chattanooga, Nashville, and Louisville, were members of classes since 1924. Younger alumni of Davidson predominate in these cities, and would naturally lead the percentage. Many of them are teaching in preparatory schools in or near those three cities. T. S. Lawson, ’26, has been made assistant attorney general of Alabama. Since completion of his law course at the University of Alabama in 1929, Mr. Lawson has been practicing in his home, Greensboro, Ala., but will soon go to Montgomery, the state’s capital, to assume his new duties.

Gaston County Alumni Give Football Banquet
1930 Edition of Wildcats Honored—Talks Made and Features Introduced—Officers Elected

The Gaston County chapter of the Davidson Alumni Association last Tuesday night honored the 1930 football edition of the Wildcats with an elaborate banquet served at the Woman’s Club in Belmont. This was the seventh consecutive year that this chapter has paid tribute to Davidson’s elevens in this manner, and players and officials were loud in acclaiming this as one of the niftiest of the series. With R. D. Hall, ’19, of Belmont, president of the chapter, presiding, the banquet was started with a prayer by Rev. W. M. Currie, '19, also of Belmont. Before being seated, a group of grammar school boys, dressed in football uniforms, sang “O Davidson,” and on the second chorus the entire gathering joined in.

Prof. F. P. Hall, ’87, superintendent of the county schools, paid one of the finest tributes ever uttered in his welcome to the Davidson football team and others from Davidson. He lauded the pre-eminent characteristics of gentlemanness and Christianness, which always predominated among players of Davidson, and said that in all the years that he had watched Davidson’s teams in action, he had never seen an overt act on their part which made him ashamed or embarrassed. Others making talks were F. L. Jackson, '06, treasurer of Davidson, Coaches Monk Younger, '19, and Tex Tilson, Ernest Milton, ’26, alumni secretary; Captain Norton G. Pritchett, professor of physical education; Captain Walter Fraley, ’31; Sam A. Robinson, ’99, of Gastonia; Hugh A. Query, '09, of Gastonia, and Dr. Oren Moore, ’08, of Charlotte. Dr. Moore was introduced as the speaker of the evening, and in his inimitable manner entertained the alumni, and mingled with that entertainment many worth-while remarks. “Davidson has always represented the one sincere ideal of my life,” he said, “and the playing of its football team has always been a great inspiration. The spirit of Davidson is perennial, and is grafted upon every individual when he enters as a student of the college.”

R. L. Stowe, Jr., ’24, and C. T. Stowe, '28, both of Belmont, were introduced as the interwoven pair, and these men were responsible for the presentation of a pair of socks, red and black in color, to each visitor. Special guests of the chapter, besides the team and visitors from Davidson, were J. C. Mason, father of W. A. Mason, ’31, member of the team, and the captain and center of the Belmont Abbey football team, coached by A. W. Baker, ’29. The entire Belmont High School squad, coached by J. K. Hall, Jr., '28, came in at the close of the banquet, and intermingled with Davidson’s team and the alumni president.
