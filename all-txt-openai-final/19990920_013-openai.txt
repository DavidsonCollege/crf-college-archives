IdnEgo - relationship advice for friends and family, foes and lovers

IdnEgo are Freud’s psychoanalytic voices that influence all relationship decisions. Id, who represents the unconscious and licentiousness in all of us, rarely agrees with Ego, who touts the conscious and morally-aware course of action. Tune in each week to hear them face off against each other as they analyze your relationship and provide counsel.

Dear IdnEgo,

I love my best friend to death, but she has one habit that’s driving me crazy. A lot of times when we do anything that involves paying for something, she forgets her wallet or comes up short. Most of the time it’s little stuff like a cup of coffee or bagel, but sometimes she “needs” $20 to buy a CD that she “just has to have.” I don’t mind “lending” her money from time to time, but it’s happening more often and she always seems to forget the paying me back part. When I ask her about the money she acts as if I’m being cheap! How can I get my money back without ruining the relationship?

Going Broke.

Dear “Going Broke,”

Look, your “friend” is an irresponsible, narcissistic, egocentric, manipulating, cheapskate, skinflint. Trust me, Id has been one himself for years. Now listen up - this is how you deal with your “friend.” Make up a bill of what she owes - add a couple bucks for your troubles and suffering that she has caused - present her with the bill and tell her to pay up. If she says no - take her stereo (or CD collection which you have apparently been paying for) and tell her she can come by and pick them up when she drops off the check - for every day she is late add $5.00 to the bill. Honestly, you don’t need friends like this - she’s using you - either figure out how you can use her or move on.

In your best interest,
Id

Dear “Going Broke,”

You seem to have overlooked the simple two-letter solution: NO. Get to know this word. Practice saying it a lot so the next time your friend hits you up for money, you are ready to spit it out. And don’t practice it the same way every time - you'd be amazed at how much emotion these two letters can express. (For example, Ego has found the brusque guttural low NO a great way to express displeasure.) But probably the most effective NO for your situation is a plaintive, embarrassed, hesitant, and slightly nervous one. Not only does it show concern for your friendship, it saves you money at the same time! What more could you want? For added drama, preface it with a quizzical look and a long “um” so she knows you’re really thinking about it. If you think you might crack under the pressure, make up some cue cards and carry them with you in case of emergency. As for the money she owes you? How much is a good friendship worth these days anyway? Five, six hundred bucks? Sounds like you’re getting a bargain.

Your friend,
Ego

P.S. Your friend Ego had a rough week!

Indigo Girls highlight Homecoming weekend

COLLEGE COMMUNICATIONS

The Indigo Girls, a self-described “power folk” band, will perform at Davidson College on Friday, October 2.~ Li tenders. Originating in Decatur, Ga., in 1987, they were awarded a Grammy for “Best Folk Recording” for their 1989 self-titled release, “Indigo Girls.” They have played for immense audiences on the Lilith Fair tour for the past three summers and are now crossing the country with their independent fall tour.

The Indigo Girls, Emily Saliers and Amy Ray, have gained wide recognition as one of the leading groups in the revival of the folky singer/songwriter genre. Their concert at Davidson is part of the college's Homecoming celebration. The show is sponsored by the Davidson College Union Concerts Committee. Doors open at 8 p.m. for the 9 p.m. show in Davidson’s Belk Arena. Three Finger Cowboy, an alternative group from Birmingham, Ala., will open the concert. Tickets are $25 and are available to the public at the door or in advance from all Ticketmaster locations (call 704/522-6500), or at the Baker Sports Complex ticket office in person or via phone (800/768-2287).
