“...maintain a male/

By JENNIFER STARR

Since 1982, Davidson College
has had an official, if little known,
policy to guide the gender balance
on campus.

In 1972, Davidson College
trustees approved admitting
women into the degree program.
Ten years later, in 1982, the trust-
ees established an official gender
ratio for admissions.

The policy stated “...Fresh-
men and transfer students shall be
enrolled in such a manner as to
maintain a male/female ratio with
the student body ranging from 3-2
to 2-1, with provision for contin-
ued monitoring year by year.”

The current gender policy was
passed by the trustees in 1988.

It specifies a gender balance
based on the average number of
male and female applicants over
the preceding five years.

The policy reads, “In the spirit
of its time-honored emphasis on
merit, Davidson College seeks the
most qualified men and women
applicants available to it.

“At the same time, it seeks a
healthy male/female balance
within the student body, avoiding
sharp year-to-year shifts that would
be disruptive to the programs and
logistics of the College.”

Dean of Admissions Nancy
Cable says the policy is “not too
constraining on the admissions
process ... The decision makers
were willing to allow the male/
female ratios at Davidson to be
guided by the general desirability
of the college in the minds of male
and female applicants.

“The five year rolling average
makes it so that the college would
never swing over to be all men or
all women ...”

Recently, the number of men
and women entering Davidson has
been roughly equal.

When admitted, the Class of
1999 contained 221 men and 210
women. The Class of 2000 cur-
rently includes 210 men and 231

For those who have grown
tired of the usual alcoholic pur-
suits provided by Patterson Court,
a campus-wide alternative may
soon be offered. The College
Union is now considering open-
ing the 900 Room bar on week-
ends on a regular basis.

“The idea came up last spring
at a Union Board meeting,” says
senior Zac Lacy, Union Bar Man-
ager, “It’s an effort to get more
programming on Friday nights and
to run more bar events.”

Lacy envisions a weekend 900
Room bar as “a casual atmosphere
where drinking is allowed, but [en-
trance] is not exclusive to 21 year
olds.”

served alcohol as many as six nights
a week. Interest died, however,
when the state drinking age was
increased to 21 in the 1980s and
students were drawn to the Court
and its kegs.

Now that the lure of free beer
may no longer draw as many stu-
dents to the Court, Union Director
William Brown observes that many
students may prefer the subdued

atmosphere of the 900 Room as
opposed to “running up and down
the stairs all evening.”

Brown says all that is needed
to open the bar more often is eco-
nomic support. “If it’s a service
that people want to take advantage
of,” says Brown, “we stand ready
to make it available.”

Feedback provided by stu-
dents at the Union Board meeting
last week was positive and all who
commented agreed that it was a
good idea. Reaction to a Friday
night 900 Room bar has gener-
ally been favorable among other
students who have heard of the
idea, though the response of the
21-group has been somewhat ambiguous.

To sustain the bar, it would
take about 50 people “spending
some money” (on alcohol or other-
wise) on a given night.

As of now, Lacy plans to
open the bar every other Friday
night beginning September 27 to
coincide with and remain open
after 900 Room movies.

The bar would proceed on a
trial basis for a few weeks until it
can be determined if student in-
terest warrants making it perma-
nent.

Union Outpost receives $25,000 makeover

By RANDY HARTWELL
Associate News Editor

Late-night visitors to the
Union Outpost wearing “beer-
goggles” should consider taking
them off to admire the recent reno-
vations there. Changes began last
year with a continuation of murals
started during the 1994-95 school
year.

Last spring, the Union board
and the Dean of Students office
approved a proposal put forth by
senior Zac Lacy and the rest of the
Outpost Committee for improve-
ments, which include the stage,
counter and new wall next to the
entrance that were all constructed
over the summer. Additions will
eventually include a row of booths,
a big-screen projection television,

a new sound system and possibly
better lighting and a new floor.

The makeover is being made
possible by a $25,000 allocation
from the Union and the Dean of
Students Office. It is essential to
the Outpost committee’s wish for
the Union Outpost to live up to its
name as an extension of the Col-
lege Union. “We’ve been trying to
figure out a way to assert a place
for programming,” says Lacy, who
is president of the Outpost com-
mittee.

Dennis Rice, who manages the
Outpost, is glad about its new-and-
improved look. “Anything that
makes it more livable for the stu-
dents makes me happy,” he says.
“Our whole idea of improving the
place was to make something be-
tween frat parties and the dull stuff
in the 900 Room.”
