THE DAVIDSONIAN, MAY 21, 1930

——

SOPHS HOLD SERVICE

(Continued from page 1)

“Because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed; blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.” The
Bible is a book of facts, and we must believe in it so that Christ through faith can be made
known to us. The second word, love, means obedience, which is greater than sacrifice. Love is the great realizer which
makes something real—things that we love are real to us. Disobedience is sin and this sin keeps us away from
Jesus Christ.

Hope is the third and last word. Our religion is a supernatural religion. There were once two men in the
English Parliament, Lord Littleton and Lord West, who decided to take two supernatural miracles which Christianity is based on, the
resurrection of Christ and the conversion of Paul, and try to disprove them. They stayed apart a year, and finally
came together with shame written on their faces, because they had a supernatural experience during that year and they had
even been converted. The conversion of every sinner is a miracle. The greatest of all miracles is to be His
second coming. Hope makes Christ real to us.

The second speaker was Bruce Peabody. He read for a scripture the story of the Ten Virgins in Matthew. His
topic was “Light.” This subject contains energy, life, and hope. Bruce called attention to part of the Davidson motto, Alenda
Lux, Let light (learning) be cherished, and also God’s words in Genesis, “Let there be light.” There are two kinds
of light, scientific and spiritual. Light means life: the grass is made green by light, trees are made to bud
by light, and flowers are made to bloom by light. God made the sun which does all of these things,
and therefore God is greater than the sun.

Bruce told the story of how a man stood on a railroad track waving his arms to stop the train
from going on and being wrecked on the track where a landslide had taken place. The light in his lantern
had gone out and he had to stay on the track to keep the train from going to its destruction,
which he did. We must not permit our lights to go out, because other lives may be in danger. “Let
your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in
heaven.”

Next, Peabody talked on the spiritual light. He told the story of how a young boy of 18 had to
swim through a great expanse of rough sea to reach a lighthouse, whose light had gone out, and which had
been placed in his keeping. What can we do to make our light shine? Although we may have only a
small flame or only a spark, we know that a spark can make a large flame. The speaker remarked that
someone is watching every man and that we must smile and be friendly and make our lights to shine. He
said that sometimes in the home the light is not kept shining and parents are neglectful and in that way
the children go astray. To close, Bruce read the hymn, “Let the Lower Lights Be Burning.” The services were closed
by singing “Have Thine Own Way, Lord,” and then the repeating of the Mizpah benediction.

TWENTY-SEVEN TO GO

(Continued from page 1)

The men last year drilled only in the morning, and because of the intenseheat, this drill was interspersed with long
rest periods in the shade. The afternoons were free, and everyone engaged in swimming in a very fine cement pool,
in baseball, and in track.

By means of this dust-proof, germ-proof, moisture-proof Cellophane wrapping, the rich aroma and full flavor of choice Turkish and mellow
Domestic tobaccos have been air-sealed in Camels for your enjoyment. If you have not tried Camels in the Humidor Pack,
all we ask is that you switch over to this brand for one day.

While congratulating the winners in the great Camel contest, we want at the same time to thank most cordially the
approximately million men and women who displayed their friendly interest by sending in an entry. We wish also to thank
the millions of smokers throughout the country for the appreciation they are showing for our new Humidor Pack, as is
evidenced by the notable increase in the sale of Camel cigarettes.

After you have learned how much milder, how much cooler, how much more enjoyable it is to smoke a perfectly
conditioned fresh cigarette, go back to the harsh hotness of stale cigarettes if you can.
