New Golf Course To Be Dedicated Tomorrow

By DAVID VAN PELT

Davidson’s new 3-hole golf course will get its first use this Saturday when alumni compete in a golf tournament as
part of Fall Homecoming. A dedication ceremony will precede the tournament. The course is named for alumnus Howard Covington ’37,
who donated the majority of the funds needed to build the course. Covington included revenue toward a golf facility as
part of a larger donation in the summer of 1982.

The facility is in its final stages of development, but is not yet completed, according to Director of Alumni Relations
Jamie May. “We're dedicating this before it’s really ready,” he said. May cited “aesthetic improvements” such as shrubs and a
fence which still need to be made on the course. He added that the course is “structurally in place,” and
ready to be played on. “The course is something that will be added to over time,” he said.

Director of the Physical Plant Grover Meetz said that landscaping will begin “almost immediately.” Meetz worked closely with landscape architect
Russell Breeden in planning the course, which is designed for use both as a 3-hole par 3 course and a
driving range. The course can also accommodate the construction of a full 18-hole golf course, if such a project ever
becomes feasible.

The Athletic Department will regulate the use of the golf facility and will maintain “very strict control” over its use,
according to Athletic Director Ed Farrell. “It is pretty exclusively for practice by our golf team, and use by our
own students, faculty, and staff,” he said. The course will operate on a walk-on basis, like the tennis courts, but
will allow no play by outsiders. The tennis courts usually allow play by outsiders but are numerous enough for this
practice, according to Farrell. Friends of students, faculty, and staff will ordinarily be prohibited from using the course. Family members
of those eligible will also be prohibited unless accompanied by the qualified member. “The hardest thing will be to police
it,” Farrell said.

While Farrell said the Davidson golf team will frequently practice on the course, he believes it will be no impediment
to others wishing to use the facility. “I don’t think any of us feel that will take up a large
block of time,” he said, adding that the structure of the course will allow its use as a driving range
at the same time others play the three holes.

Covington’s donationPaid for the bulk of the course’s construction, but the actual building costs have not been determined. Maintenance costs
are expected to be considerable, according to Meetz, including the recent hiring of an employee whose primary responsibility will be
maintaining the course. Though the responsibility for these costs has yet to be determined, Meetz speculates that most of it
will be included in the budget of the Physical Plant, as are the maintenance costs for the other athletic fields.
The dedication will begin at 9 a.m. Saturday morning at the golf course and will include remarks by Farrell and
Interim President Johnston, and an introduction of Covington. Following this will be a Closest-to-the-flag competition among alumni, and the alumni
tournament will begin at 10 a.m.

ROTC’s Get Airborne

Last weekend, 21-23 October, 30 Davidson cadets flew via the 145th Tactical Airlift Group (Charlotte, NC) to Ft. Bragg, N.C.
where they participated in small unit training with the 7th Special Forces Group (Airborne). The 7th Group Green Berets provided
instruction in foreign weapons, radio communications, first aid, and reconnaissance patrolling. CPT Burke, 7th Group OIC of the training, said,
“The Davidson students demonstrated plenty of enthusiasm and an eagerness to learn.” To keep the pace despite cold winds, rain,
and little sleep, the students needed plenty of enthusiasm. But once again the Davidson cadets demonstrated the drive which helped
earn them top standing in the entire First ROTC Region last summer. Cadet Major Brad Perkins said, “This weekend of
training is just another example of how the US Army Special Forces have earned their reputation as the finest soldiers
and best military instructors in the world. We owe the 7th Group our gratitude and respect.”

Davidson Trustees Return For Fall Business Meeting

By ALLISON WILLS

The fall meeting of the Davidson Board of Trustees is expected to be uneventful with an emphasis on maintaining the
status quo and avoiding any major decisions. “We'll keep things on a steady course,” said Richardson Love, assistant to the
president and coordinator of the meeting. “There'll be no drastic changes until the new president is named.” Committee meetings will
be held all day Friday, culminating in reports which will be presented to the full board in the plenary session
Friday evening and Saturday morning. SGA President Hunter Monroe, and Trustee Pro-Tempor and religion professor David Kaylor will act as
representatives at the plenary session. Their influence, however, is limited to the floor. They will not be eligible to vote.
“The issues dealt with by the board will depend on what the committees do,” Love said. “There's no way to
determine what the issues will be.” “All we know for sure is that there will be a report from Dr.
Griffith on admissions and financial aid, and, of course, Dr. Johnston will give a report as well.” Following the plenary
session, the board members will conclude business with a confidential executive session open only to board members in which any
progress concerning the Presidential Search Committee will be considered. Besides meetings, the Trustees will also participate in a reception with
students at 6:15 p.m. and the Covington Golf Facility dedication Saturday at 9 a.m.
