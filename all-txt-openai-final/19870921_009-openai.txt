SCHOOLS HELL FINALLY BEGINS

THIS IS THE FIRST SEMESTER OF THE REST OF YOUR LIFE

BASIC RULES FOR FRESHMAN FAUX-PAS!

NEVER TALK ABOUT:
1. HOW COOL YOU WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL
2. ADMINISTRATORS, COMMITTEES, AND THE MURAL COMMITTEES.

REQUIRED READING: EVERYTHING ELSE.

RESPECT YOUR PARENTS SO MUCH THEY'VE COME TO GET YOU OUT OF THE TEACHER AND SHOUT "AU CONTRAIRE MON FRERE!"

HOW YOU NEVER HEARD SUCH OF MY GRANDFATHER BECAUSE YOU HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO DO.

YOU INADVERTENTLY ABSORBED INEAUOES VOW, PROFESSOR!!

SHOULD YOU JOIN A FRATERNITY OR SORORITY? AREN'T THEY ALL JUST REACTIONARY XENOPHOBIC ENCLAVES OF SUPERFICIAL, CONFORMIST LITTLE SNOBS?

OH MY GOODNESS, GOING GREEK IS FUN!

SEEK COUNSELING IMMEDIATELY.

IS COLLEGE HARD OR EASY?

IT'S JUST LIKE SUMMER CAMP ONLY WITH BEER, DRUGS, PARTIES, PRANKS, PANTY RAIDING, AND HAZING.

TRUE, THE ATMOSPHERE IS A BIT INTELLECTUAL BUT WHO GIVES A HOOT?
