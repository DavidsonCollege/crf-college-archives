North Carolina College Journalists Meet at Trinity to Discuss Problems - Forty Delegates From Various College Publications of North Carolina
Assemble—Reception and Banquet Given in Honor of the Association—Every Angle of Newspaper Work Discussed

The North Carolina Collegiate Press Association convened Thursday night, November 15th, at Trinity College, Durham, N. C. The first meeting
of the convention was an informal reception. During the reception, the delegates were addressed by several members of the Trinity
faculty. At the Friday morning meeting, W. N. Keener, editor of the Durham Morning Herald, spoke on headline writing.

Holiday Plans Include Dramatic Club Program

Three Plays to be Presented on Saturday After Thanksgiving

After the speech, the meeting was thrown open to discussion. Such topics as the writing of paragraphics and means of
securing efficient business assistants were brought up. On Friday night, a banquet was given in honor of the delegates by
The Tombs, an honorary fraternity of Trinity. Several of the Trinity Glee Club men furnished entertainment both vocally and with
stringed instruments. Professor Cannon, of Trinity, acted as toastmaster, and the president of The Tombs, L. D. Elkins, president of
the association, and Miss Frances Cherry, made short speeches.

The Saturday morning session was devoted to the reports from the member publications and speeches by two of the delegates.
Miss Frances Cherry, of Meredith College, spoke on cooperation between the editorial staff and the business department as essential to
every college publication. W. J. Bullock, of Trinity, spoke on methods of securing advertising. Reports were heard from 11 newspapers
and five magazines. A report on the work of the committee which was appointed last year to work on the
association's short story and essay anthology was also heard at this time. The “Pine and Thistle,” of Flora Macdonald, was
taken into the association. It was decided to hold the spring convention at Elon College. A resolution thanking the faculty,
students, literary societies, and publications of Trinity for their hospitality and the enjoyable entertainment which they offered the delegates, was
adopted by the association. The convention was then adjourned.

The officers of the North Carolina Collegiate Press Association are:

Friday night will see the close of the class basketball championship series. The game will probably be between the Junior
and Senior teams and promises to be an interesting contest. After the game, there will be a picture show, Harold
Lloyd in “Safety Last.”

The climax of the weekend festivities comes Saturday night when the Dramatic Club presents three one-act plays. These plays were
written by L. D. Elkins, W. F. Galloway, and Prof. E. J. Erwin, all members of the Dramatic Club and
of the Sigma Upsilon Literary Fraternity.

The first play, Out O’ Goodness, is a cynical tragi-comedy, written by Liston D. Elkins. The cast for this play

Stith and Hollingsworth Selected to Debate Next Month

Mother Chapter Hostess to Gamma Sigma Epsilon

Davidson Exhibits Powerful Offense But Tar Heel Players Swamp Light Line

National Chemical Fraternity Organized at Davidson

ADOPT CONSERVATIVE POLICY

Chapters Have Been Granted to Five Ranking Colleges

On November 16th, Davidson College had the peculiar privilege of opening her doors to Gamma Sigma Epsilon, an honorary chemical
fraternity of national range, in its first annual convention. Alpha Chapter, the mother chapter of the fraternity, was host to
the visiting chemists, who came from three states—Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina. Organized in 1919 by students of Davidson College,
under the leadership of Dr. H. B. Arbuckle, Gamma Sigma Epsilon has enjoyed a period of steady but conservative expansion.
Active chapters are now located at Johns Hopkins University, University of Florida, North Carolina State College, and Alabama Polytechnic Institute
(Auburn). All but two of these were represented by delegates at the convention, and one of the unrepresented chapters sent
in a good report of work accomplished.

The convention opened on Friday afternoon at 2:30 o'clock, in the hall of the local chapter. An address of welcome
was delivered by the presiding officer, Dr. H. B. Arbuckle, head of the department of Chemistry at Davidson. The reply
was given by H. I. Jones, Auburn. Reports of the chapters were received and discussed, a pleasing indication that the
fraternity is doing splendid work in all of its chapters. Some time was taken up in revising the constitution and
ritual, and plans were laid for the publication, in the near future, of a magazine to be known as “The
Ray.” A conservative policy of expansion was maintained, unfavorable action being taken upon the petitions of several institutions for charters.
A model initiation ceremony was presented by the home chapter in a very efficient manner.

As officers for the ensuing year, the following were elected: Dr. H. B. Arbuckle, of Davidson, grand chancellor; Dr. C.
W. Keenan, of Johns Hopkins University, worthy grand alchemist; H. I. Jones, of Auburn, grand recorder; O. J. Thies, Jr.,
of Davidson, grand keeper of the cult; M. R. Bonner, of Davidson, grand historian.

Davidson Wildcats swept the Tar Heels off their feet and threw a real scare into the Carolina camp when Popsy
Hunt's place-kick from the 20-yard line gave them a 3-point lead. Unleashing a driving attack in the first period, the
Wildcats exhibited a versatility of attack and perfection of teamwork which kept the Carolina players on their toes. Carolina finally
won, 14-3, but the Red and Black Machine exhibited a powerful offense.

Hillhouse Makes Fine Address Before Y.M.C.A.

Hillhouse Discusses Attitude of College Graduates Toward World Problems

Albert Hillhouse, president of the student body, spoke to the Y. M. C. A. last Sunday evening, taking as his
theme the question, “What Shall Our Attitude Be After College?” Instead of attempting to add any new thought, he gave
a brief resume of some of the points stressed by speakers here, and with this as a basis, pointed out
the conditions that men might be better served.will confront college men and what their attitude should be toward those conditions.
He pointed to Livingstone in Africa, whose motto was “Anywhere if only it be onward”; to other pioneers in work
for the betterment of humanity; to martyrs who lived and died. He then showed briefly some of the evil conditions
of the world today. “The world is torn after a devastating war. It is restless and doubtful and tired of
the old and not sure of the new. The churches of Europe are hollow and they are being cast aside.”
He pointed to economic and sanitary evils the world over. “And yet we see,” he said, “in so many cases,
no response to these needs by the church. So very few of the followers of Christ are interested in social
conditions, and as a result we find the slums of our cities almost within sight of big churches. We are
too much concerned with non-essentials—dogma, creed, ritual—and too little concerned with men in their need and want.”

The Davidson Intercollegiate Debating Team, composed of M. C. Stith and A. H. Hollingsworth, with D. B. Walthall as alternate
and manager, will meet Washington and Lee in Shearer Hall, Friday, December 14th. These men were elected from a group
of seven entrants in the preliminaries held in My Hall, Wednesday night, November 14th. Warren Cox presided and Professors Arbuckle,
Currie, Lingle, Brown, and Dendy acted as a board of judges.

The question on which the teams will clash is: “Resolved, That the present immigration law should be re-enacted.” The law,
as it is in force today, states that the number of immigrants of any nationality admitted to the United States
each fiscal year shall not exceed 3% of the number of persons of such nationality in the United States according
to the census of 1910. Davidson will uphold the negative side of the query. Since the selection of the team,
the debaters have been hard at work on the query. (Continued on page 6)

Carolina team on the defensive through the major part of the game. It was a case of too much Bonner.
After the Wildcats had taken the lead at the close of the first period, Blanton kicked off to Davidson. For
the first time during the game, the Tar Heels held, and Hunt punted to their 32-yard line. Then the Tar
Heels started their offensive, and with Bonner and Devin carrying the ball, they marched down the field 68 yards on
17 plays to a touchdown, McDonald carrying the ball over the score. Again in the third period, Carolina received a
punt in midfield, Rabbit Bonner made 10 yards around right end, and then circled the other end for 21 yards.
The quarter ended with the ball on the 3-yard line and on the fourth down Bonner threw himself over the
pile of forwards for a touchdown. McDonald drop-kicked both extra points. The Wildcats gained more than the Fetzer eleven and
made 12 first downs to Carolina's 14, but the long arm of Fate interposed itself and victory was snatched from
the Presbyterians. Early in the game came the first break. The Red and Black Machine had carried the ball 50
yards to the 20-yard line, but Davidson was penalized for holding and the ball was put in play on the
37-yard line. Then Meyer intercepted a pass and one scoring chance was gone. Carolina was forced to punt and Hendrix
returned to the 40-yard line. After an interchange of punts, Davidson got the ball on her own 37-yard line. Two
line plays gained 3 yards and then Hendrix, aided by perfect interference, made 18 yards over tackle. (Continued on page

Glee Club Schedules Friday Night Musicale

Wildcat Songsters Perform at Home Before Starting on Southern Trip

The song-birds of Davidson, already popular with the music lovers of the state of North Carolina, will appear before the
students of the college and as many townspeople as Shearer Hall can accommodate Friday night. The performance will begin promptly
at 7:30 o'clock, according to C. Victor Brown, manager of the club. The local performance will precede the Southern trip
through North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, which will begin December 3rd. The club has appeared in Huntersville, Shelby, and
Salisbury to date, and every day Manager Brown receives requests from every quarter of the state and the South asking
for engagement contracts. It is a general concession that the Glee Club this year, under the leadership of Ted Jones,
and under the proficient tutelage of Mrs. Coral Baker, is the best musical organization ever developed at Davidson. It bids
fair to become one of the most popular college clubs in the entire South. The choruses, trained by Mrs. Baker,
