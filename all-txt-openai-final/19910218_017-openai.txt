Music Professor Declares Faith In Power Of African Art

By Bryan Bayles

“In any case it is clear that if art has importance, it is because it can... enlarge or trivialize the imagination. If it can do so much, it affects the social fabric as well as individual lives for good and evil.” - Jacques Barzun

During the history of critical theory, two major theses regarding the potentialities of art have developed and at times converged. The first of these, arising from the philosophic climate of 19th-century Marxism, asserts art’s power to serve as a commodity in the monstrous “machine” of capitalistic exchange. The other, more romantic, approach declares art’s power to serve as a catalyst in spiritual and psychological healing. This approach has been further explored in a psychoanalytic approach to critical dialogue. But what unites both these approaches to art is a belief in the “power” of the aesthetic experience, for good or evil.

Davidson’s own music professor and composer-in-residence, Wilmer Hayden Welsh, has recently declared his own faith in the power of art. From February 1-28, at the Afro-American Cultural Center in Charlotte, Welsh will be displaying 30 pieces of African art selected from his own private collection: one of the most impressive in the state. In addition to Welsh’s pieces on exhibit, works from the Saccoh Collection of Jersey City, N.J. will be on sale as well.

Welsh hopes to use his exhibition, which is being displayed in conjunction with Black History Month, to promote racial harmony. Welsh professes a strong belief in art’s ability to serve as a medium of cultural and spiritual exchange. “I won’t have to mention the word ‘race’ at all," he says. "If people become interested in art they'll become interested in the people and cultures that produced it, and look at them in the context of all art. I can’t think of anything better I can do to ease racial tensions than this.”

Professor Welsh explains that African art is usually broken down into two classifications: tribal and court. The tribal pieces are those created by village artists as integral components of the spiritual life and ceremonies of the village community. These include exquisitely carved and beautifully ornamented fetish figures, used for singular magical purposes. The court pieces, on the other hand, are expressions of the wealth and power of the tribal chief, intended to impress their onlookers. His collection of court pieces includes a Bamum elephant mask of wood, elaborately decorated with copper, cowrie shells, and European Colonial coins.

The most significant aspect of this art for Professor Welsh is its captivating spirituality. “All of the tribal pieces were done as religious expressions of the people,” he explains. “These pieces are similar to medieval western church art; they have the same type of compelling spirituality that comes from inside the piece. I can spot it from across town.”

Welsh hopes that the universality of this spiritual expression will be recognized by the visitors to the exhibition. He is himself a devout Christian whose music is often spiritually inspired. “This artwork is the way that this particular group of humans expresses the concerns that are common to us all. I want the...public to understand that message in this exhibit.” And it is by this contention that Professor Welsh posits himself in the long tradition of art-lovers who place faith in art’s power as a suggestive and communicative vehicle. As Welsh continues to bring his fabulous collection to others throughout the world, he opens up the potential for people to commune through art in what art-historian Jacques Barzun has called “a spiritual event divorced from creeds."
