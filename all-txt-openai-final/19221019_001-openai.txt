Vol. X

DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N. C., OCTOBER 19, 1922

No. 5

“PROPOSED NEW
CHAMBERS HALL
DAVIDSON COLLEGE

TO DAVIDSON MEN

By MALCOLM LOCKHART, Director of Campaign.

One of the most interesting, entertaining, and at the same time, gripping books written in connection with the World War was one entitled, “The First Hundred Thousand.” This was the stirring account of the mobilizing and training of the first 100,000 soldiers of the British volunteer army, and this 100,000, of course, represented the utmost devotion and the highest patriotism to be found among the young men of England.

It is the thought of the campaign forces to give the Davidson faculty and undergraduates an opportunity of subscribing at least a considerable portion of the first $100,000 to be raised in Davidson's great campaign. Campaign total to date, with the campaign having been waged completely in only one Presbytery, and partly in two, out of the seven Presbyteries in the State, is around $75,000. We are certain that the students and faculty of Davidson who are daily in touch with the needs of the college, and whose daily pathway runs through and around the ruins of old Chambers Hall appreciate so keenly the need that they will be quick to subscribe their $25,000 quota and complete the first $100,000 in subscriptions, thus taking part in the first response of loyalty to and interest in our cause.

It was the writer's privilege to direct the campaign for your sister institution, Agnes Scott College, of Decatur, which accomplished the subscribing of $825,000 in toto. Of this amount the students and faculty subscribed on a two-year payment basis in round numbers $30,000, or an average of $60 per individual. Most of these splendid young women will pay these pledges from their personal resources.

In the $1,000,000 campaign of the University of Georgia, of which the writer is an alumnus, the undergraduates subscribed $132,862 on a five-year payment basis, and the faculty subscribed $36,123. The stu-

THE NEW CHAMBERS

New Chambers, for months a beautiful dream to the students and alumni of Davidson, has emerged from the infant stage of fancy, and is now a concrete, tangible thing toward which the eyes of the Southern Presbyterians are focused.

The new building will be situated on the site where historic old Chambers stood and in general make-up will resemble the old structure from the exterior view. An effort will be made to use the four columns that now stand as a relic of the early days of the college, but in case this cannot be done they will be reproduced as nearly as possible.

“The new building will be the center of the work of the college—its great workshop—and it is thought will be unsurpassed by any similar college building in the South,” is the statement made by Dr. W. J. Martin.

In a statement issued to the alumni President Martin says:

“New Chambers will really consist of three buildings, joined by corridors.

At a meeting of representatives of the student body, the campaign forces, and the faculty of Davidson, the following committee was appointed to conduct the campaign on the campus in connection with the $600,000 drive, of which $400,000 is to rebuild Chambers Hall, $200,000 for additional endowment. A more representative lot of men could hardly be selected, and there is universal confidence that they will put the campaign over in a way to uphold the traditions of Davidson and the Wildcat spirit.
