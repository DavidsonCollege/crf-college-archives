College reexamines
writing courses

By KATIE PFEIFFER
Senior Staff Writer

Davidson College is currently
examining the nature of its writing
course (W-course) requirement as a
part of a self-study that draws on
ways to develop undergraduate
study with the Southern
Association of Colleges and
Schools.

The W-courses have come under
scrutiny in recent years due to con-
cerns over their ability to provide
students with the writing tools they
need to approach courses in other
departments.

Dean of Faculty Clark Ross
believes that the universality of
skills taught by the W-courses
makes them essential to the
Davidson academic experience.

“The W-course underscores the
importance of writing regardless of
a student’s major,” Ross said. “It
satisfies the composition require-
ment, ensures that the student is in
a small class, encourages discus-
sion, and is supposed to teach the
Honor Code with respect to writ-
ing.”

The W-course program began in
1998 when Davidson adopted the
idea of the first-year seminar and

Group working to bring
black sorority to campus

By LEXI HAMILTON
Staff Writer

Several young women at
Davidson College are currently
launching an initiative to bring a
historically black Greek-letter
organization for females to
Patterson Court.

The group met with representa-
tives from Alpha Kappa Alpha
Sorority, Inc., Delta Sigma Theta
Sorority, Inc., and Zeta Phi Beta
Sorority, Inc., earlier today.

The students anticipate that such
an organization will encourage
young women of color to become
more active in the Patterson Court
community.

The current small percentage of
female minority membership in
Patterson Court eating houses con-
cerns some members of the
Davidson community.

“A rough statistic of participa-
tion among young women of
color,” said Ashley Moore ’07, “is
about one one-eighth of a percent-
age point.”

Patterson Court Advisor Joy
Hamm said she would “like to see the
involvement of minority women
increase in Patterson Court life.”

Whitney White ’08, a supporter
of the proposed organization, said
the administration, Patterson Court
eating houses, and the student body
have given the group and their pro-

‘A Night for New Orleans’

Benefit concert raises over $4,000 for the Salvation Army

By KATE GILLESPIE
News Editor

Monday’s “A Night for New
Orleans” concert held in the Baker
Sports Arena raised $4,140 for the
Salvation Army to aid with
Hurricane Katrina relief efforts.

The Union Board Concert
Committee, which planned the
event, sold 642 tickets to Davidson
students and the general public.

The concert, which featured the
New Orleans-based groups Better
Than Ezra and Lil’ Malcolm
Walker and the Zydeco House
Rockers, was free to students, but
the Union Board asked for a $10
donation from concertgoers.

According to Concert
Committee chair Erin Doyle ’08,
the concert was a success.

“We always want more students
to attend, but the most important
thing was that everyone who came
to the show had a great time,”
Doyle said. “The bands were great,
and the audience participated and
cheered. We’re pleased with how it
turned out, and we’re pleased with
the donation to the Salvation Army.
Almost everyone who came donat-
ed money.”

The Concert Committee, which
coordinates two performances per
year for Davidson students, had
originally planned to invite either
Guster or 311 to play at Baker in
the fall. A survey went out to the
student body in August, but the

Sophomores compensated
for problems in apartments

By COLLEEN MCKOWN
Staff Writer

The Residence Life Office
(RLO) is giving residents of the
sophomore apartments $100 of
additional CatCard Bonus Bucks in
an effort to compensate these stu-
dents for their cooperation during
recent problems with heating and
air conditioning.

“We very much regret the incon-
venience and disappointment expe-
rienced by Knox, Irwin, and Akers
students,” Director of Residence
Life Leslie Marsicano said in a let-
ter to Knox, Irwin, and Akers resi-
dents. “We appreciate your
patience and cooperation as we
work to provide a reliably comfort-
able heating and air conditioning
system.”

The problems were caused by
the computerized control system
for heating and air, which was pro-
grammed incorrectly over the sum-
mer. At the beginning of
September, the computer was read-
ing room temperatures in Akers as
if they were in Irwin. As thermo-
stats in Akers read that these rooms
were hot, cold air was pumped into
the corresponding Irwin rooms
instead.

Before the Physical Plant figured
out the cause of the problem, Irwin
students were freezing while Akers
students were too hot.

“It was a pain to have a cold
room to come back to and not to be
able to fix it,” said Irwin resident
Nathan Bradshaw ’08.

Akers residents had the opposite
problem.

“It was disgusting to have to
sleep in an 85 degree room. It’s
been better this week; it’s good to
finally be cold,” said Patrick
Polenz ’08.
