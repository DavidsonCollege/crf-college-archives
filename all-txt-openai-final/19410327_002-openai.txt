to anyone else besides a few pledged persons, who tally the votes. The only reason that the name of the
person is needed is to prevent absentee balloting and the “stuffing of the ballot-box;” checking for suspected “combines” may also
be needed. But the checking-off of each voter from a list makes further identification unnecessary, unless an investigation is conducted.
The stapled ballots could be opened under such a condition. The present open-faced ballot would be adequate if members of
the Elections Board safeguarded their confidences as well as they are pledged to, but the odds are against such a
consistently secretive committee. The stapled-ballot system would only incur the expense of the stapling machines and perhaps slightly longer ballots,
so that the folded bottoms would not lap over the list of candidates. The only resulting trouble would be negligible
to outline the simple plan to the students, and in keeping with the two or four machines in good working
condition. As an amendment to this plan, if there is needed any check-up as to fraternity combines or “swings,” I
suggest that each person be required to state his fraternity or else put down “Non-frat.” on the top of his
stapled fold. If this information is not given, the vote should not be counted. The head of the Elections Board
plus another member should take a representative number and open these to make sure the truth is given; severe penalties
should follow offenses. In this way, the Elections Board can watch for “deals” without knowing the exact individuals. The members
should be honor-bound in keeping this confidence. The purpose of this action is to prevent fraternity combines as much as
possible, although much more is needed to stop this tempting practice of which any self-respecting student body should be ashamed.
Another suggestion is that the head of the Elections Board be a non-fraternity man. This idea is not prompted by
any criticism of the present committee head, but if it happened in the future, it would be difficult for any
fraternity member chairman to bring reproach upon any, or especially, his own fraternity. If possible, the name of this chairman
should be kept secret to the members of the student body so as not to raise resentment against any individual
in case of incriminating action. A criticism can be made of the disposition of the individual used ballots. Whether the
condition exists now or not, in former years, access to the used ballots was fairly easy. Certainly, the ballots should
be kept locked up, and not merely (Continued on Page Four)

IN CLOSING...

DAY’S DIARY
BY

Before passing on to the latest, let's zip back to Tuesday night of last week and into an apartment in
the city where we find Ed Shewmake with several of his cronies questing locks. Most of the reeling and dealing
of the weekend took place up in G'boro, revolving around the tourney and the Golf Ball. Flag Pole Edmundson forsook
the links to hoist his fighting banner in the parlor of the lass’ dorm; he remained at this glorious field
of danger until the house mother whipped him off the chair at 11:49 p.m. Burt Kerr ran his weekly taxi
service to the woman's college to transport all those men with the “sugars” on. After the Golf Ball several of
the local boys flew into a rage for some unknown reason and left Dead Pan Lucas with a couple of
broken windows. Fred Little, one of the most completely locked and shot men in the class of ‘41, zoomed up
to the south’s Washington to see the One. There was some mix-up about the time and she being in a
bad humor after the waiting around, jerked off his fraternity pin to return it. She could not bear the thought
of parting with that beautiful jewel and broke down in tears, whereupon, Fred immediately returned it to her. Now they
are all set to go and plan to drop in on the j. of p. in S. C. on their
way to Washington Thursday to make the merger legal. Another of the freshmen wild hares has forged to the front
by his recent transactions. Senator Hill and Sam Overby were on one of their numerous excursions to the Moore when
the road ended abruptly in a clay cornfield where they remained the rest of that night. Carlton Parsons slipped over
to Concord recently in that new tomato-soup colored machine of his to test horns (the camels-are-coming) out of hearing of
the ex. committee. Some of the Pikas are unable to figure out the frequent trips of Ed Scott to Statesville
as he would not be going home so often. Deduction leaves Mitchell for the answer. What's the dope up there,
Ed? General limber Jimmy Houston got on top of the 8 ball in Winston Sat. with the notable Miss McCoy
delivering the stimuli. Jim Chapman seems to have taken up where his two frat brothers, Honey Dew and Skeezix Williams,
left off with Miss Deas. Honey has his ring and picture back while Chap is sporting the well-used and ancient
photo. Dick Rankin took off on an extended trip to Va. in the wee hours of Sun. a.m. too bad
Sweet Briar was out! During the last dance set Dirty Dan Hodges had the bad luck of having his date’s
car attacked by an unknown assailant who cost him three flats and a broken window. This week Dan received a
letter from his date’s father saying “you can have the car for thirty dollars more.” Geddy Herring recently got a
postcard from the city requesting that he bring the all-famous Mule Sproull over to date Queen Bee Smith’s ashes—the blonde
Dynamite Harris. Knute Edwards and Joe Eves took Blasting Bumbarger for a ride in the latter’s new coupe. Paul is
now having the shiny job completely renovated. Shorty Parrish turned Gene Autry by his recent display of horsemanship. Apologies to
the ambitious junior who has been so unfortunate as to have been omitted among the “dishonorable” dealers. He should come
out of his pigeon hole and make himself known.

Compassing Campuses
BY TOM CAUBLE

Ye who have cause to have considered yourselves unjustly lampooned herein are entitled to apology because this column has not
been exactly “a medium of student and faculty opinion” nor has it been quite “the official history of college life.”
My best wishes to him who takes over here at the next issue.

ON SPRING HOLIDAYS:
That much chronicled and long-awaited holiday season for which the spring-feverish collegian has yearned is at last upon us. The
peculiar attractiveness of a seven-day recess at this time obviously includes more than a mere suspension of academic work. Let
us then consider the motives, wishes, and desires of the average undergrad in regard to this particular matter. In the
first place, the date has an economic effect on the senior class that ‘41-ers can now navigate their machines on
paved roads instead of being forced to frequent the muddy and rutted hidden by-roads. This practically eliminates wash jobs altogether.
Thus legal cars for seniors after the holidays is a potent motive although it might be called a minority wish
in that it affects directly only one class. A second goal-set for this holiday period is the wanderlust which is
especially active within every collegian with the coming of spring. It matters not if New York, Miami, Havana, and Nassau
must eventually be compromised and replaced by the Camden Cup Races or the swamps of eastern Carolina—the urge to travel
is a potent factor in causing collegians to look forward to spring holidays. There is another group common to every
campus that may best be described as “seasonal mock-watchers.” This not inconsiderable quorum is tired of sleeping in lecture chairs
and would improve its repose by a good couch or a week's tenure in bed. There is a decided minority
group yet to be considered—in fact, we may be speaking here of one man. It is estimated that .0009 per
cent of the student body looks forward to spring vacation as a time to write term papers. The fact that
this .0009 per cent is in reality only half a man may be explained by the fact that he really
doesn't want to but is conscience-driven. As always there are those who desire the seven-day reprieve solely to lay court
to their lady-loves. This is a decidedly potent factor in motivating all, but as a 100 per cent goal-set it
seems to represent a minority. On the other side of the fence are those who are violently opposed to the
spring recess—at least to this particular one. This group includes those who are required to take deferred exams and re-exams
in order to toss their hats into the B.A. ring. To establish one’s candidacy for a diploma in this manner
must indeed be heart-breaking and it is a feat that should be undertaken only by the philosophic. To return once
more to the spring-feverish, there are those among the seniors who have a year or so’s Rote’ing to do immediately
after graduation. Thus these men must work their summer vacations (as enjoyed in former years) in during this last holiday
period. How to roll the pleasure of three months into one week is a topic that time, space, and talent
will not allow us to treat here. Mayhap you can gain that for yourselves at subsequent student store labs or
through the workings of the “grape-vine.”
