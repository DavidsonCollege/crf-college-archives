editor of Quips and Cranks this year.

Dr. D. Freeman Defeats Peal Bamberger

Dr. Douglas Freeman, who visited Davidson last week for the Phi Beta Kappa banquet, was guest speaker at the chapel
exercises on Thursday morning, at which time he outlined to the student body his ideas of a foreign policy.

Dr. Freeman, who is present editor of The Richmond Times Dispatch, wrote the Pulitzer Prize biography a few years ago.
This prize-winner was a four-volume life of Robert E. Lee.

In his address to the entire student body this noted speaker and author told the students that the United States
could follow no better policy in the present foreign crisis than one of complete non-intervention. He stressed the importance that
emotional appeals play in our attitude toward other nations’ affairs.

In an effort to point out the dangers that may arise from too great enthusiasm for the foreign causes, Dr.
Freeman gave the example of how the “British cause” might become “the cause” and in turn “our cause.” The speaker
believes that this emotional movement might incite America into the present foreign crisis.

Sam Spencer and Hank Bahnson attended the annual meeting of the North Carolina Federation of Students in Chapel Hill as
delegates from Davidson College, Saturday, March 29 and 30. This convention is for the purpose of discussing ideas about student
government, the delegates from the various schools are to be measured and take back new ideas from other schools.

The speakers at the convention will be Albert Coates, director of the Institute of Government; Robert House, Dean of the
University of North Carolina, and William Aycock, former president of the Federation. Spencer and Bahnson spent Thursday in Chapel Hill.

Casey Jones has been elected president of the Y. M. C. A. He is a member of Pi Kappa Alpha
social fraternity. Dale, a rising senior, is a member of the Phi Delta Theta social fraternity. During the past year,
he served as Sports Editor of the Davidsonian. He is a member of Sigma Upsilon, honorary literary fraternity. He also
is connected with the local chapter of Delta Epsilon, the journalism fraternity.

George Grantham belongs to Sigma Alpha Epsilon social fraternity, and is varsity manager of the football team for next year.

The Annual

Quips and Cranks has been issued annually for over four decades. Each member of the Davidson student body receives an
edition, which presents campus pictures, faculty members, student government, classes, athletic teams, honorary fraternities and clubs, and social fraternities.

Dr. John R. Mott, “world traveler and world Christian,” will deliver the lectures for the Otts Foundation, which presents campus
pictures, faculty members, student government, classes, athletic teams, honorary fraternities and clubs, and social fraternities.

These lectures, known as the Otts Lectures, have brought some of the church's foremost preachers and leaders to Davidson at
intervals of about once every five years. They were endowed by Rev. W. P. Otts in 1893.

Dr. Mott himself is one of the greatest Christian leaders of the present day. He has traveled extensively and has
been a prominent figure in world Christian activities.

The first luncheon will take place at 1:00 Friday, to be followed by a discussion led by Mr. Coates, in
which he will present an outline of the results of his study of the development of student government.

These men were elected to their respective positions by the managing editors for this year in a special meeting held
two weeks ago. Taylor has not yet announced the junior editors for his staff, but will wait until April to
choose them.
