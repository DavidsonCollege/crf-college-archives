Coaches Pleased at Line Prospects—Backfield Looms As Problem

Davidson Defeats South Carolina 36-27 and Furman 30-25; Drop Heart-Breaker to State as Mann Stars

Spring football practice will get into full swing next week, following the exam period, as the Wildcats get the kinks
out of the sixty-odd candidates. Coaches McIver, Chap, and Spearman are viewing the prospects with cautious optimism.

Davidson’s crack basketball team swings into the last half of its strenuous schedule this week with a tournament invitation playing
Guilford here and Charleston, S.C. Citadel. The Wildcats, after setting South Carolina back 36-27 and Furman, 30-25, were stopped by
State 30-29 before a packed house.

Carolina Leads

North Carolina’s White Phantoms led the conference contenders into the stretch, boasting a record of three wins and one loss,
and are ranked together with Washington & Lee's defending champions as the strongest contenders for tournament honors at this stage
of the game. However, with Davidson's Wildcats, State and Wake Forest developing rapidly, the race promises to be the hottest
in several years.

Down Gamecocks

Ability to make free throws gave the ‘Cats its victory over the South Carolina Gamecocks that January 11. Both teams
scored exactly the same number of field goals, but the margin of victory came when the ‘Cats tossed in 12
out of 21 tosses from the free link. Jim Cowan, lanky center, led the attack with 13 points to his
credit, while Hicks trailed him with 8. Alexander and Hutto, with 9 and 7 points, paced the losers. With only
five minutes left in the game with the score tied at 19-19, both teams put on desperate scoring sprees, but
the 'Cats made 17 points that proved to be the winning margin.

Next

In a fast game at Greenville, Davidson took an early lead over Furman and held it throughout the game. At
intermission the score was 14-9, but the ‘Cats came back strong in the second half and collected 10 field goals
and 10 free throws as Furman was making 8 field goals. Cowan again led the ‘Cats with 7 points but
the real star of the game was Hicks, ‘Cat guard, who played a splendid defensive game.

‘Cat Frosh Meet V. P. I. At Blacksburg Saturday

Davidson’s frosh wrestling team tangles with the V. P. I. yearlings Saturday night. The freshmen five go into action against
a high-scoring Darlington Prep and G. M. A. teams this week.

Freshmen Play Darlington

Thursday night the freshmen five turned back High Point College by a score of 29-17.Here is the cleaned OCR text,
preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

Hoe, a big fullback up from the frosh, showed plenty of competition in sports contests between times during the year.
The star end of the year for Davidson showed the makings of a one-year player. Blythe and Fulcher announced that
the silver figure holding a victory wreath would be given to the team. The State crew rallied quickly and forged
ahead. Jones, a State guard, fouled Iverson, who was the high scorer with 19 points in competition. With only seconds
left, Iverson failed to tally, and the game ended. Iverson and Hicks looked good for the 'Cats. The Executive Committee
has been working faithfully, and if the 'Cats pull a surprise and drop the little Gobblers, it would mean a
lot for the team.

Contrary to popular opinion, mat contests have almost always proved competitive. The Citadel team lost a hard-fought match, but the
State crew rallied quickly and forged ahead. Jones, a State guard, fouled Iverson, who was the high scorer with 19
points in competition. With only seconds left, Iverson failed to tally, and the game ended. Iverson and Hicks looked good
for the 'Cats. The Executive Committee has been working faithfully, and if the 'Cats pull a surprise and drop the
little Gobblers, it would mean a lot for the team.

Football, basketball, wrestling, and badminton have been popular sports. The Wildcats tied with North Carolina and N.C. State for the
state championship last year, and they hope to walk off with the honors this year. The Phi Gams hold the
lead in the interfraternity race with a win in badminton and a tie for the football crown. The Phi Delts
are in second place. Attention is now being focused on the basketball race, which will get underway this week. Fast
games are expected from all the frats, and an interesting race is in prospect. Actual hostilities began yesterday as the
S.P.E.'s battled the Pikas.

The Y.M.C.A. Book Exchange, conducted by Rod Williams and Dick Vowles, was open from last Friday through Tuesday. It was
operated by the "Y" for the convenience of the students on a non-profit basis. This year's business has almost doubled
that of last year.

Today's popular sport is bowling. On Saturday nights—or any other night—take her out to bowl. She'll like that! Take her
where she'll feel at home. The Center Bowling Center is the place to go.
