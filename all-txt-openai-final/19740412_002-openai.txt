To the students of Davidson College during the term 2022-2023, a response to correspondence to THE WINTER, Box 218, Davidson,
NC 28036 is greatly appreciated.

The SGA has organized a referendum to address the concerns of the student body. The referendum will be held to
discuss various issues and gather student input.

The Senate has also appointed Jim C. Godipehere as Assistant to the President for the 1974-75 academic year. Godipehere, a
recent graduate, will serve as a liaison between the administration and the students.

In other business, the Senate heard reports from John Taylor of the faculty's Educational Policy Committee, and from Vince Rab,
Bo Hunter, Mark Rail, and Steve Bell about the recent National Student Association Southern Area Conference.

The Community suggested that some of the 1973-74 SGA budget be used to bring Paul Wolf to speak at Davidson
next fall. The motion passed unanimously.
