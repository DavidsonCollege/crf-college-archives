STUDENT BODY DIVIDED INTO NINE GROUPS

The new plan which Dr. Martin proposed, seeking the co-operation of the student body in bringing up the quota of new students for Davidson next fall, will work splendidly if every student does his part. The student body was divided into geographical groups, each under faculty leadership, which, through personal correspondence, will try to interest prospective students in Davidson. The students from North Carolina were divided into three groups: Eastern, Western, and Central; students from South Carolina into two groups; students from Tennessee and Mississippi compose one group; Georgia, one; Virginia, one; and students from all other States not previously mentioned compose a ninth group. Each group has elected a steering committee, which works with the faculty leader. Each student is requested to prepare a list of prospective college students, whom he knows and to whom he will write a personal letter. This list of names with addresses will be furnished to the faculty leader through the steering committee. All information attained in replies to the letters will also be furnished to the faculty leader. Each student is also requested, when he goes home, to “follow up” his letter by speaking to the boys to whom he has written.

DR. CLARK SPEAKS ON "THE DUAL SELF"

Dr. B. O. Clark, of Salisbury, N. C., addressed the Y. M. C. A. meeting last Thursday night, his subject being “The Dual Self.” The keynote of his address was Romans 7:19: “The good that I would, I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.” The speaker advanced five propositions: first, that man’s greatest enemy is himself; secondly, the worst thing that can happen to a man is to be left to himself; thirdly, man’s greatest duty is to fight himself; fourthly, the greatest boon a man can have is deliverance from himself; and fifthly, a man’s greatest investment is the investment of himself. Dr. Clark then showed how Christ delivers a man from himself and teaches him to invest himself. ThroughoutIn his discourse, Dr. Clark explained his thought with many illustrations. The meeting was thoroughly enjoyed by all present, for the helpfulness and originality of the talk was refreshing. The new Y. M. C. A. Cabinet has been announced and consists of the following men: J. H. Miller, Jr., Attendance; W. M. Currie, Bible Study; R. F. McClure, Christian Activities; L. A. Woods, Devotional; J. W. McAlister, Fresh Reception; C. W. Worth, Mission Study; S. M. Gilbert, Missionary Fund; Emory Flinn, Personal Work; and A. S. Potts, Publication. The officers elected at the meeting of the Y. M. C. A. some time ago were E. G. Lilly, President; C. W. Worth, Vice-President; D. M. Chalmers, Secretary; and A. D. McArn, Treasurer.
