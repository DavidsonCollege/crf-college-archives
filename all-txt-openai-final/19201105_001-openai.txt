**Tennis Team Takes Two Out of Three**

Elon and Trinity Fall Before D.C. Net Artists—Wake Forest Wins

The Davidson tennis team, composed of Ormond, A.C., and Bradley, took the first trip of the year to Elon, Trinity, and Wake Forest. The trip was a success, the team winning two out of three matches. The tennis “sharks” left here Tuesday night and on Wednesday played the strong tennis team of Elon on their own courts. Bradley played a strong game and won from the captain of the Elonites in straight sets. The next match played was the doubles, and again the Wildcats were victorious in straight sets, winning by a margin of 6-2, 6-4. The match between Ormond and Atchison was incomplete on account of darkness and rain.

The next team to be overcome by the Wildcats was the Trinity team, who thought themselves contenders for the state championship, having beaten the University of North Carolina and Guilford College. In the doubles, Ormond and Bradley won the match in two sets, the score being 6-4, 6-4. Bradley won his match against the captain of the Methodist team, Whitner, in a handy manner, beating him 6-3 and 6-3. Ormond was beaten by Cornwell, whose net game was too good to be overcome. The score of this match was 6-4, 6-4.

In the last match of the trip, the Baptists from Wake Forest won both the doubles and singles. In both cases, the match went three sets, the Davidson team forcing them to extend themselves to win. The score in the doubles match was 4-6, 6-4, 7-5. Stringfield, of Wake Forest, bested Bradley in a fast match. Stringfield is a small man, but he is very quick and covers a court well. The score in this match was 4-6, 6-2, 6-3. The match between Ormond and his opponent was incomplete on account of darkness, the score at the end being 6-6. Sometime this fall or next spring these teams will be played again, this time on the Hill.

**FLAG TO BE AT HALF MAST SUNDAY**

On Sunday, November seventh, President Wilson has ordered that all flags be placed at half-mast at every military post in the United States. This sign of mourning is used as a token of the Nation's participation in the memorial services held for our soldiers, sailors, marines, and others who lost their lives in the World War. It is interesting to note that in bringing a flag to half-mast it is customary to raise it as high as possible and then lower it to half-mast. In lowering the flag, it should be carried again to the top then lowered.

Dr. Martin and family motored to Red Springs to attend the wedding of Miss Margaret Vardell and Mr. Alexander Sprunt, '18, of Charleston, S.C.

**FOR A BETTER DAVIDSON**

DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N.C., NOVEMBER 5, 1920.

**Physical Exercises Form Prominent Feature of First Inspection—Company B in Action.**

**St. Claire Sisters Score Big Hit**

Classical and Popular Music With Readings Compose Excellent Program

The St. Claire Four—Sisters, the second number of the Redpath Lyceum course, pleased an audience that packed Shearer Hall Monday night. The ladies were especially effective ensemble, whether in instrumental or vocal numbers. None of their trios or quartets failed to please their audience, while the solo numbers were almost as pleasing. The sisters, Ella, Mary, Kathleen, and Lillian, won the support of the house with their “Opening Song,” which was tuneful and unique. Continuing in vocal quartet, the “Show Me” song was given with a dash and swing that brought down the house. The versatility of the company was shown in the effective rendition of the famous “Barcarolle” from the no less famous “Tales of Hoffman,” in which the rich contralto of Miss Lillian was heard to good advantage.

In “It Takes a Girl to Do It,” Miss Mary introduced herself as a reader. As a well-merited encore, she gave “She Was Fishing.” Later she attempted “Scenes From the Studio,” a rather lengthy discussion of the ways of women when they are being photographed. The only impersonation that had the ring of sincerity was that of the “romantic school girl.” “He Wouldn't Tell His Maw,” her last offering, was much better.

Of the night's offerings, none pleased the house better than the instrumental quartet numbers. And they were still more effective when bits of vocal harmony were thrown in for good measure. “Bo-la-bo” and “Swanee” were given with a will and swing. When Miss Ella started in on that mouth organ—Boy howdy! Watch Your Step! And how about her “religion” in “Ise A-goin’ Home?” The most tuneful bit of the lot though was the rendition of “Sweet and Low” by the contralto with stringed accompaniment and with the full quartet on the chorus. The two violin solos were especially pleasing and well selected. The first vocal solo by the soprano, Miss Ella, was a little ditty about “The First” with a charming lilt and a catching refrain. As an encore, she sang a little something about “Dreams and You and Me.” Later efforts of the soprano were not so pleasing.

**PHOTOGRAPHIC WORK OF ANNUAL NOW COMPLETED**

No, everybody's best girl is not on the hill. “Well, then,” you ask, “what on earth is everybody so dressed up about?” That is surely a reasonable question, for all the students, from C.K. Brown to D.T. Mahood, have been strutting around the campus like best men at a wedding ceremony. An explanation of all these “pretty boys” is in reality not at all difficult. The Annual photographer has been trying out his camera on the various organizations, clubs, bands, societies, associations, etc. of Davidson. Nobody knew there were more than half a dozen or so, but when the call was sounded, 35 organizations volunteered to occupy space in the coming Annual.

Not only have the clubs suffered the trials of “looking sweet” for the camera man, but individuals have also been called upon to act as victims. The stream of shiny-faced, slick-haired gentlemen filing in and out of No. 9 Georgia is proof of the fact that the management is making real headway in the photographic lines.After getting your beauty struck, the next thing is to produce a “snap” of your girl. These pictures will be run in full-page panels and will compose the beauty section. Just think how pleased she'll be, and hand in her picture at once.

Intercollegiate Debating Preliminaries Held
Junior-Senior Debaters Chosen Same Night—Hot Contest for Places

On Tuesday night the preliminaries to the Junior-Senior debate and at the same time the preliminaries of the intercollegiate debate were held in the Philanthropic hall. The subject discussed was, “Resolved, That the Federal Government should prohibit the immigration into the United States or any of its territory, for a period of twenty years, of Japanese laborers.” On the affirmative were C. K. Brown, J. H. McKeithen, A. F. Fricker, D. W. Roberts, and J. F. Clark. On the negative were F. V. Long, D. R. Freeman, and C. G. Long. The contest was one of the most heated heard in the Philanthropic Society for several years. Any one of the contestants would prove a credit to the society. However, the teams as selected by the judges from the faculty, were, for (Continued on page 8)

Initial Inspection of R. O. T. C. Very Satisfactory
Company “D” Wins First Place in Contest for Honors

Last Friday afternoon the first of the regular monthly inspections of the R. O. T. C. was held. The companies in turn maneuvered on the athletic field before an assembly of students and townspeople. Some very intricate drills were undertaken and all the companies made a remarkable showing, considering the fact that 60 percent of each company never have had drill before coming to Davidson. They did well for soldiers of a month and a half who are not subjected to intensive training by any means. A special squad from each company drilled in the gym. Dr. Fraser Hood was the judge of this drill, and in the maneuvers outside, Captain Hearn, Dr. J. W. McConnell, and Major Rogers were the judges. The judges decided that the honors of the day should go to Company D, commanded by Captain Romefelt. B Company, under Captain Boulware, was next, and Captain McCaskill’s Company C was next. A Company, Captain Mitchell commanding, won two first places, but lost out in the drill and came last.

GAMMA SIGMA EPSILON

The regular bi-monthly meeting of the local chapter of the Gamma Sigma Epsilon was held Tuesday, October 26. This fraternity is for the promotion of interest in chemistry on the Hill. In this meeting prospective chapters in the extension of the fraternity were discussed. It was decided that several of the larger universities in the adjoining states should be granted chapters within the next few months. After the business had been dispersed with, J. M. Dunlap entertained the members with a paper on the “Purification of Water for Industrial Uses.” In this, he showed that water must be purified for use in engine boilers and how it is done. An informal “feed” completed the evening’s program.

Davidson Downs the Citadel in Classy Contest
Bulldogs Put Up Clean and Plucky Fight but are Unable to Stop Victorious Wildcats

The Citadel Bulldogs and Davidson Wildcats did battle last Saturday at Wearn Field, the result being a 27 to 13 victory for the Red and Black machine. Davidson entered the fray handicapped by the loss of three of her first string men due to the S. I. A. A. rulings and two regulars due to injuries, but this loss was overcome by the push and plucky fighting of the Presbyterians. Although the game went against the Bulldogs continually, they put up an undaunted spirit which netted two touchdowns for them in the course of the game; their last and second goal was won during the last three minutes of play, when the shades of evening were falling so fast it was hard to distinguish the different men in the scramble. The outstanding feature of the game was the spirit of fair play and clean sportsmanship, which was clearly shown by both contestants.

In the first quarter neither team succeeded in pushing the pigskin over the goal line. The ball was worked up and down the field with little advantage to either side. Clary got away around right end with a 15-yard run for Davidson and Jarvis ran 20 yards for Citadel. These runs were the main features for that quarter.

In the second quarter Davidson made her first touchdown after Kullock had kicked 30 yards into Davidson's territory. The ball was returned, Shepherd gaining 3 yards; Douglas 2 yards; McFadden pass to Clary 32 yards and McFadden carrying the ball over in the next play by a short run around right end. Brady kicked goal.

Another touchdown was gained in this period when the Bulldogs received but failed to gain. Kullock kicks and Davidson advanced the ball with a 20-yard run by Bethea, through the line, 15 yards around left end by Clary, 12 yards and over the goal by Bethea. Brady again kicking goal.

In the third period Citadel resorted to forward passes and kicking. Kullock’s short kicks gave the Wildcats their opportunity and after a bad kick Davidson received the ball on the 20-yard line and after a 5-yard line plunge Shepherd went through tackle for the third touchdown. Brady kicking goal in his usual manner. In this quarter the Bulldogs succeeded in putting one over when Jarvis received a fumbled ball and ran 60 yards for their first touchdown. Kullock kicked goal.

In the fourth quarter the Wildcats pushed the Bulldogs back early in the quarter and Long who substituted in the backfield after consistent gains carried the ball around end for Davidson’s final touchdown. Brady failed to kick this goal. During the last few minutes of play Citadel received the ball (Continued on page 8)
