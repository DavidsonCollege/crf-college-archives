THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

**Put The "Greek" Back In "Hell Week"**

An alumnus, returning to the campus last Wednesday for a brief stay commented, “Well, looks like ‘Hell Week’ is in full progress.” “No,” we explained, “It’s ‘Greek Week,’ not ‘Hell Week.’” He said he didn’t see much difference. We didn’t either when we thought about it. The brick sacks, calisthenics, egg throwing, and general pledge harassment are as much with us this year as last, except the time regulations forced several fraternities to start earlier and work harder at showing pledges just what miserable creatures they were supposed to be.

Despite the IFC pronouncement that there would be no physical exertion, a significant stream of freshmen has showed up at the infirmary for treatment of injuries received in the line of duty. A check Wednesday night revealed that a partial accounting up to that time included two sprained ankles (one a case for crutches), a seriously injured toe, initially considered to be broken, and a badly bruised back with possible injury to a kidney. We suspect that by the time this paper reaches the dorms the list will be considerably longer.

Without sounding coy we must suggest that these injuries, and the multitude of sore muscles plaguing the freshmen have come from something more strenuous than helping Barium Springs orphans paint playground equipment. The sum of the matter is that most of the letter of the law concerning “Greek Week” activities is being observed, but the idea has been lost. The IFC, by adopting a ridiculously loose interpretation of the rules, has made little contribution to preserving their spirit.

We fail to see the logic of the activities of the recent “Greek Week,” but more important, we feel that the IFC and its member fraternities have failed to work for the original stated objective of ending the outdated activities of traditional “Hell Weeks.” Nothing can be done about the week just past, but the DAVIDSONIAN suggests that the IFC act immediately to outlaw drilling, calisthenics, mud baths, and the other impedimenta which turned this past week into a ‘Hell Week.” If the IFC does not act, the faculty may. We think it is better to keep the problem under student control, if student leadership demonstrates the maturity to handle it.

**College Bowl: Success or Failure?**

By the grace of CBS, Davidson will soon have a chance to grab the brass ring on the TV College Bowl. This program is essentially the same in purpose and method as the more renowned quiz shows (Twenty-One, $64,000 Question, etc.), with the added interest of intercollegiate competition.

We should have the proper feelings of gratitude, of course, to the network, the producers, and General Electric, which sponsors the show, for Davidson is certainly not an obvious choice to compete in the same league as schools like Notre Dame and Princeton. We had better realize that when it is announced that the challenger on April 19’s program will be Davidson College, several million Americans will ask “Where’s that?”

It is quite possible that Davidson’s “team” will do well on the program. It is just as possible that they will fail miserably. With either outcome, however, we are in danger of reacting the wrong way. If we should succeed, there will be a widespread feeling that our success is indicative of a general level of education equivalent to or better than that of the school we beat. If we lose, some short-sighted people will declare that this implies general inferiority in education and culture among the students, and that steps should be taken to pump the student body full of facts similar to those required for success on the College Bowl.

Either reaction, as serious reflection will show, would be irrational. The College Bowl is an interesting exercise in memory and reaction time for certain individuals, but from performance on it no conclusions can be drawn one way or another concerning the success of a college’s educational program, or the worth of its goals.

**Spring Brings Cultural Opportunity**

Dr. Davidson’s chapel presentation last week was a most refreshing change from the dull and haranguing diatribes we are accustomed to listening to between the hours of 10:20 and 11:00 three times a week. The hilarious, musically annotated extravaganza was most appropriate. Too many times we have heard chapel orators attack the values of the present Davidson generation and warn us that we are nothing but a group of conformists. For several years student writers and caffeine philosophers have placed the Davidson student into the conformity-organization-security mold with comparative ease. It has almost become a tradition to criticize the college. Good constructive criticism is necessary for growth and perhaps the critics are partly right in that we need more originality and idealism on the Davidson scene. But for the most part all that we have heard and read about the Davidson student being “homogenized” and “moulded” is itself, in effect, leading this school toward stagnation in a pot filled with cynicism and pessimism.

There is much to be said, however, for Davidson College as a living ideal. The college prides herself on the well-rounded program she offers, both in the curricular and extracurricular activities. Perhaps it would be a good idea to hear more often from the musical talents of the student body, for example, preferably in the morning Chapel service. That is, provided the sophisticates of WIST’s “Fabulous Forty” could spare the courtesy to appreciate this type of program.

The anti-conformists are right in one respect at least. A basic defect of Davidson students has long been an unconcern for national and international affairs in several areas: science, politics, economics, religion, honest intellectualism. Last fall, the Great Issues Program almost kindled a creative interest in the current events which give meaning to our abstract curricular material, but the spark was soon to be snuffed out by intellectual indifference. This spring there will be many cultural opportunities such as the Fine Arts Festival and the ever-present Artist Series. If Davidson is ever to achieve the alleged broadening effect of a liberal arts education, it would seem that occasionally the Mooresville flick should yield to a personage like Clement Attlee. Are we getting a liberal education of the arts or an arty view of the liberals?

**CLASS OF ‘62**

**Freshmen Top Survey Of College Board Averages In South**

By ED ARMFIELD Davidsonian Managing Editor

Some weeks ago Assistant Dean of Students H. Edmunds White sent a request to leading colleges and universities in the South and throughout the nation asking them to supply Davidson with information regarding College Board results both for comparison and for admissions study.

**DAVIDSON TOPS**

An analysis of the information returned to Mr. White shows that Davidson (the Class of '62, at least) ranks at the top in Southern schools and deserves high ranking nationally. Centre, Sewanee, Southwestern and Stetson were the Southern schools which sent replies containing the necessary information to make an objective comparison of schools.

**MATH**

In the math score, Davidson was high with an average of 570 followed closely by Sewanee with a class average of 553. In verbal average the lead positions were reversed with Sewanee holding an edge of six points. In both math and verbal the other schools followed in the order of Southwestern, Centre and Stetson, all Southern schools with which Davidson is often compared. Emory, Vanderbilt and Washington and Lee were all contacted but either neglected to answer or chose not to publish their scores. Duke University sent material which would be difficult to analyze in this brief study.

**ENTIRE NATION**

A quick glance at the comparative scores of the corresponding schools of all other sections of the country — East, Wooster; Mid-West, Chicago; Far West, Pomona — would give the impression that the calibre of student entering these schools is much higher than the average Davidson freshman.

However, one should remember that in other sections of the country students are better acquainted with standard-Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

ized tests and in many instances study for just that type of test, whereas many students in the South are completely unfamiliar with this type of testing. This can account for much of the gap between Southern schools and schools from other parts of the country. Nonetheless, Davidson's score is much above average for the entire nation. The schools listed below represent the very best of American educational institutions.

62 EXTRA CURRICULAR

At the same time the College Board averages were released, Dean White also gave to the DAVIDSONIAN a summary of some of the many high-school activities of the Class of '60. These are figures which President Martin recently reported to the Board of Trustees during their winter meeting to illustrate the well-rounded qualities and diversified interests which accompanied such commendable scholastic achievement.

ATHLETICS

In athletics, 55% of the Freshmen won monograms and many others participated but not to a sufficient extent to earn a letter. Those who won varsity letters averaged four letters per student, which indicates year-round athletic participation. About one-third of the class were either president or vice-president of their high school student body or of their class in high school. Of this number, twenty freshmen were president of their student body. In addition to the 33% cited above, an additional 42% held some major class office or a major office in a church group.

EDITORS

While approximately one-half of the class were on the staff of either annual or newspaper, thirty-two of them were editors of those publications. If we include all who either (1) earned varsity letters, (2) were on the staff of the annual or newspaper, or (3) held major school or church offices, we have included 91% of the class.

SALMAGUNDI

Toumaras’ Swan song: "I Am Glad" By JOHN TOUMARAS

Last week this page contained an editorial calling for the advocates and opponents of an integrated Davidson to marshal their arguments and prepare an intellectual and moral foundation for their beliefs. The reason for this was that sooner or later a Negro would apply for admission. Perhaps there are no moral and intellectual grounds for denying the application of a qualified Negro student, but there is a practical or reasonable basis for refusal. A Negro student may get along very well in the classroom and Student Union, and he may be tolerated at campus activities, but will he be given the opportunity to enjoy all the rights, privileges, traditions, benefits, and customs of a Davidson student? Only the student body can guarantee this opportunity. Will they do so next year or in ten years? I do not think so.

Didn’t the Interfraternity Council vote to do away with Hell Week last year?

Many are asking if the Peon Army will march this year. Unless an act of God or of the Executive Committee intervenes, the Peons will march. General Red of SHPAD states that this year’s parade will contain cavalry, an international brigade, and, perhaps, an air-force.

In eighty days another school year will draw to a close, and another graduating class will leave the maternal confines of Davidson and head into the Abyss. Reviews, chapel, Vespers, Hattie’s, and the Union coffee will become memories. No doubt each graduate will ask himself and his fellows if the four years were well-spent, if anything of value were attained and retained, if the end product justified the sacrifices made in order to transform the raw material, and if there is any hope for the future. These questions are not unique. They have been asked in the past and they will be asked in the future. Their answers remain the same. Yes, my little die-cast, well-turned Davidsonian, the years were well-spent; you are a unique product; there is hope.

If you have read this far you will learn that this is the final appearance of Salmagundi. I, too, am glad.

THE PHILOSOPHES

Summary of Ideas For New Council By DAVID ROBINSON

The following is a collection of ideas expressed in recent discussions and conversations concerning the institution of Student government at Davidson and the role of that institution in the coming year.

Several principles operate or should operate in our system. Rather than adopt the too often prevailing attitude that what governs best governs least, we should seek a program which best combines the fulfillment of the interests of the student body with the wisdom of authority. We are both an academic community of faculty and students, and a democratic community of students and student council; the two will of necessity conflict in certain areas, but nonetheless must seek constant interrelation.

HONOR COUNCIL

The creation of an Honor Council points to a philosophy of leadership. There is adequate leadership on the campus to handle the functions of this additional body without any decrease in the quality of work. Leadership duplication should be avoided if possible, and leadership development become a more primary concern. Concentration of effort and time should replace concentration of leadership as a theme of campus activity.

GREATEST CHALLENGE

Many problems face student government in the coming year; they are of both a general and specific nature. The increase in and improvement of communication between faculty and students through the student council and between this latter body and the students themselves is the greatest challenge ahead.

COMMUNICATION

If communication is a perennial problem, the need for creativity on the part of the 1958-59 student council is a unique and particular one. The inability to specify the new activities of the council will make greater its inclination to relax. Another area of concern is the gap between faculty and student body regulations on certain issues and between theory and practice on all levels. The merits of both ambiguity and hypocrisy relative to the consequences of their removal must be considered.

DOUBT

There is some doubt as to whether we are responsible for our own constitution and whether student body expression or action has any significance for the other and more ultimate authorities of the community. The specific tasks of student government will be considerable. In the area of theft and theft control, a decision may be necessary to institute a system of fingerprinting or locked doors; if neither of these is adopted, a stronger program of the present type will have to be implemented. Freshman orientation and the function of the Court of Control should be revised somewhat. The Honor Court should develop effective judicial procedures. The student council should consider the questions of affiliation with some national body, a possible change in the system of chapel services, the possibility of readmittance for a student expelled for an honor violation, and the realm of school spirit and support.
