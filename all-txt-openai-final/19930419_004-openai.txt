Calendar Set for Next Year, Some Express Their Disappointment

By Mandy Curtis

Instead of starting classes on the 24th of August as was done this year, classes for the ‘93-94 academic year will begin on August 30. This means that school will begin an entire week later.

With this new calendar, exams will end the semester at noon on December 23, just two days before Christmas. The Executive Committee of the Faculty, comprised of the President, Dean of Students, Dean of Faculty, professors from different departments, and an SGA representative, meets each year in December to derive the calendars for the next two years. In December, the committee set a tentative calendar for the ‘94-’95 academic year and confirmed the dates for next year.

According to Dr. Alexander McKelway, member of the Executive Committee of the Faculty, there are many different components that go into making the calendar. There are set faculty regulations for the number of classes in each semester and for the number of days for optional classes and exams. Beside these policies, the faculty requires that each semester begin on a Monday.

Monday, Wednesday, and Friday classes cannot meet any less or more than Tuesday, Thursday classes throughout the semester. Fall break, Thanksgiving, Christmas holiday, and spring break must all be accounted for. In the spring semester, exams must end a few days before graduation to allow for enough time for the professors to get senior grades in before the commencement.

Due to all of these predetermined factors, the calendar falls into place. The Executive Committee of the Faculty tries to fulfill everyone’s expectations, including the faculty, students, athletics, and staff. In regard to next year’s fall semester, the reason that classes will begin a week later than they did this year has to do with when the Monday falls in the month. According to McKelway, “that gets you into one week or another.”

According to McKelway, it is a perceived desire that students would rather lengthen their summer than start even earlier in August. However, he said, “If you took a vote there would be a divided opinion about coming to school a week later.”

For next year, the administration has allowed for registration for the upperclassmen before classes begin. As confirmed by the Executive Committee of the Faculty, classes will begin on Monday, August 30. Fall break will be October 16-19 and Thanksgiving will be November 24-28. Classes will end December 10 with optional class days from the 13th-15th. Reading day will be on the 16th and exams will be from the 17th-23rd.

For the spring semester, classes will begin January 19. Spring break will be March 19-27. Classes will end May 3, optional classes will be May 4-10, reading day on the 11th, and exams from the 12th-18th. Commencement will be on May 22.

A number of students have expressed their distaste or ambivalence for next year’s calendar. “If someone lives far away—12 hours like me—it will take me a whole day to get home. I'll get home on Christmas Eve. We want more time before Christmas,” said freshman Martina Love.

Sophomore Eric McMichael stated, “I think it’s a little too close to Christmas to be letting us out. But other than that, I don’t see a problem with it. I like coming back late.”

“I don’t know how many people work over Christmas break, but I’m a waiter and the most money comes in a week before Christmas. Now I’ll only have one day before Christmas. Besides, who wants to be home until the 19th of January?” commented freshman Nick Troiano.

Kappa Sig Runs Race in Memory of Two Brothers

By John G. Harper

On Saturday, April 24th, Davidson will witness yet another fun run for charity; but this run is different. Kappa Sigma will spon-For the fourth annual MADD run in memory of two fraternity brothers. In 1989, an automobile accident claimed the lives of two Kappa Sigma Brothers from Salisbury, John O. Reynolds and Patrick Virtue. Reynolds was a Kappa Sig member at Davidson while Virtue was a member of the Colorado Gamma Tau chapter. The Kappa Sigma MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving) run began in 1989 as a charity relay run to Charlotte to benefit the Mecklenburg County MADD chapter. In 1990, John R. Cook, class of '92 from Salisbury, changed the event to a memorial run to Salisbury, benefiting the Rowan County MADD Chapter. Cook remarked, “The run in honor of John O. and Pat was started because of the closeness the fraternal bond had created among the three of us.” Over the past three years, the brothers of Kappa Sigma have raised over $7,000 for MADD. Fundraising chairs Bryan Allison and Kevin Garbee hope to raise $3,000 this year. The sixty-four mile relay run will begin this Saturday at 8 a.m. on the Town Green in Davidson. Each participant will run at least a one-mile section passing a football as a baton. The run will continue to Salisbury, passing the Reynolds' and Virtue's homes, and then back to Davidson. Scheduled to finish at 5 p.m., the run will conclude in a celebration on the Town Green for runners and supporters with Domino’s Pizza and refreshments. All are invited to attend. Cook summed the run up by stating, “It’s a fantastic project because it’s great for the community, great for the house, great for MADD and great for the families involved.”

### DIAMOND BUYERS

When buying a diamond, you should be aware of these criteria as they determine the value of a diamond anywhere.

#### Why Is Diamond Cut So Important?

A properly cut stone is proportioned so that when a ray of light enters it, that light will be reflected back through the crown or top of the diamond with maximum prismatic “fire.” A cut of proper proportions increases the value and beauty of a diamond, yet less than 1% of all diamonds cut are cut to ideal proportions.

#### What Are The Most Important Factors When Selecting A Diamond?

In today’s diamond market, there is a decline in standards including inaccurate diamond grading, misleading discounts, and deceptive pricing. Since 1954, Donald Haack Diamonds has built an international reputation by making it a point to show our customers the facts while maintaining our high standards of grading.

#### How Does Color Affect The Value Of A Diamond?

Diamonds are graded from D-Z alphabetically. The finest color is colorless. You can begin to see yellow in an L. Most fine jewelers carry J-L. At Donald Haack Diamonds, you will see distinct diamond color differences because you will be viewing all of our diamonds unmounted and comparing them to GIA certified Master Stones in our laboratory.

#### What About Clarity?

Clarity is the presence or absence of inclusions. It may not always affect beauty, but it always affects price. At Donald Haack Diamonds, you will be able to view the clarity of your diamond in our lab using our 10-power magnification microscope.

#### Why is Carat Weight One of The Least Important Factors?

Improper cutting may add weight to the stone and may also reduce the stone's brilliance. You should be aware that there is a “price break” between a 0.99ct diamond and a 1.0ct even though there are only 2 points difference and both are ranked as “1 carat diamonds.” On top of this, the cut may make the 0.99ct appear larger than the 1.0ct. But more larger diamonds have significant value.
