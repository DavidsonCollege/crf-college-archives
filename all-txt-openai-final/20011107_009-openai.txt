Men’s basketball hopes to rediscover winning ways

Veteran team hopes to build on last year’s semifinal finish

Not much was expected from the men’s basketball team last season. With a roster that included no seniors and six
sophomores, most observers called it a “rebuilding year.” As the season unfolded, it became apparent that experience and veteran leadership
were in short supply. The Wildcats struggled to a 15-17 record, including a 7-9 mark in the Southern Conference. Part
of the problem was a plague of injuries, which kept the team from developing continuity and rhythm, and part of
it was inexperience. Whatever the cause, it marked Davidson’s first losing season in eight years.

But the year wasn’t all bad. In the Southern Conference tournament, the Wildcats came within one game of playing for
a bid to the NCAA tournament with a thrilling win over College of Charleston, the South Division No. 1 seed.
Although UNC-Greensboro would end the Wildcats’ season in the semifinals and go on to win the tournament, Davidson gave its
fans cause to hope heading into the 2001-02 campaign.

Now it’s time to turn hope into reality. The Wildcats look to return to their usual position near the top
of the North Division, and return to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1998. Conference coaches picked Davidson
second in the North in a preseason poll, but this year, anything less than a championship will be a disappointment.

The Schedule

Before they begin to think about conference play, the team must contend with what coaches call one of the toughest
non-conference schedules of any mid-major program in America. It starts on Nov. 16 at Charlotte, perennially one of the strongest
teams in Conference USA. The 49ers have won the past five Hornets’ Nest trophies, awarded annually to the winner of
this Mecklenburg County rivalry game. The road gets rougher four days later when the Wildcats travel to UNC-Chapel Hill for
the first meeting with the Tar Heels since 1969. Throw in games against defending national champion Duke and fellow ACC
contender Georgia Tech, St. Bonaventure of the Atlantic 10 and Ivy League contender Penn, and you can imagine why Davidson
will be relieved when conference play arrives.

The Formula

Head coach Bob McKillop says the point guard position may be the key to his team’s success. Michael Bree will
run the show, with Fern Tonella backing him up. Bree got off to a slow start last season because of
an ankle injury, and the team struggled in his absence. “I’ve really learned the value of each possession,” said Bree,
who hopes to apply the lessons of the last few years to this season. “Each possession can determine the outcome
of the game.”

Bree’s teammates have noticed the three-year basketball evolution of the Irishman. Said fellow senior Martin Ides, “Physically, he’s so much
stronger than he was when he got here, and he’s not afraid to take and make big shots in big
situations. This fall especially, he’s much more of a leader on the floor.”

Wayne Bernard is one of the team’s most talented and dynamic players, as well as its leading scorer from last
season. Sophomore Nick Booker, who showed great potential last season, and junior Peter Anderer, easily the team’s top outside shooting
threats, both will plan their games. St. Louis freshman Eric Blancett has shown promise in early season workouts.

Chris Pearson and Martin Ides anchor the inside game, a crucial element of McKillop’s system. Pearson enjoyed a breakout season
a year ago, and after playing this summer on a Charlotte Pro-Am team, he’s ready to continue the success. The
improvement of Ides was key to the Wildcats’ strong finish, and they’ll need another big year from the big man
in the middle. “I have really become more confident in myself,” said Ides. “I’ve also learned to trust our system.
I truly believe that if all five guys on the floor do their job, there’s no one that can stop
us.” McKillop calls forwardEmeka Erege is the “glue” that holds the team together. He has endured several injuries throughout his
career, but he raises the game of those around him when he is on the court. Erege says the balance
of talent across the roster will be a major strength. “Our team is on more of the same level this
year,” Erege explained. “In the past, we’ve had one group that was either a lot better than the rest of
the team or couldn’t keep up with the rest. This season, we’re more equally strong. Everyone has a chance to
make an impact, from the seniors to the freshmen.”

Another valuable utility man is Finland export Jouni Eho, a sophomore forward with a deceptive three-point shooting range. Junior Michel
Lusakueno and Irish freshman Conor Grace will add depth in the paint.

Mike Anderson
Seniors Fern Tonella, Martin Ides, Emeka Erege, and Michael Bree will lead Davidson into the 2001-02 season as the Wildcats
aim to return to the top of the Southern Conference.

The Conference
The SoCon is expected to be much improved from top to bottom. UNC-Greensboro, picked first in the preseason coaches’ poll,
is the class of the North Division. The Spartans have beaten Davidson five straight times (including three last season) by
a combined 13 points, so when the teams meet again on Jan. 23, expect another epic battle. East Tennessee State,
last year’s regular season champion, will also contend for first place, with Appalachian State, Western Carolina, and VMI rounding out
the bottom. In the South Division, Georgia Southern returns all five starters and is the coaches’ pick for the title.
The College of Charleston, always a top-notch team, is not far behind. Chattanooga, The Citadel, Furman, and Wofford are likely
to finish in that order.

The Forecast
Davidson plays an ambitious non-conference schedule every year, but it has never been this tough. Luckily, the team got a
head start this summer during a two-week trip to Italy, during which the Wildcats compiled a 5-1 record against top
professional opponents. “We really jelled on the court in Italy,” said Bree. “We’ve always gotten along great off the court,
but it just seems like this group is all on the same page.”

Every team in the SoCon knows that, come tourney time, the regular season is not all that important. Whoever gets
hot on the first weekend in March has a shot to advance to the NCAA tournament. If they stay healthy,
the Wildcats have as good a chance as anyone. The four seniors have all been encouraged by the work ethic
of their teammates over the past few months. Said Tonella, “We’re a lot more confident than in years past. The
veterans don’t need anyone to push us to get better; this team is mature enough that we all push ourselves.”
