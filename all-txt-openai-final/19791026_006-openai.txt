~ Se WHe Avice, Daven’ ‘seem like a rather dull place to many of us. But economics professor Clark Ross would probably disagree. After graduate studies at Boston College, he taught at William and Mary and then joined The Kred Center for Research on Economic Development at the University, of sense of “common commitment” shared by the various departments. Sometimes he wished that students were “less interested in grades and more interested in understanding,” but attributes their attitude to the times. (See Ross, page 7)

Melinda Lesher is enthusiastic about art history. This new member of Davidson’s Art Department contends, “We all think that we’re so visually aware, and we’re not. Art history helps us to become more visually sensitive.” Lesher comes to such conviction from a strong and impressive background of experience and education. After graduating from Vassar, Lesher has continued her education, earning her M.A., M.Phil., and Ph.D. She has studied and done extensive research under the Kress Fellowship and the Fulbright-Hays Fellowship. Most recently, Lesher has been studying at Columbia University and an adjunct lecturer at the City University of New York.

Ruth Ault’s teaching style has been characterized as “lively but thorough,” and she is said to have an excellent rapport with her students. Perhaps this is because, as one student put it, “you have a feeling that it hasn’t been too long since she was a kid herself—like maybe last summer.” That no doubt comes in handy for Dr. Ault, whose specialty is child psychology. Her own childhood years were spent in Chicago; from there she went to California for her undergraduate work at Pomona College and her Masters and Doctorate (in developmental psychology) at UCLA. Before coming to Davidson she held an assistant professorship at the University of Utah at Salt Lake City. She is very pleased with Davidson in general and the students in particular. “There is a great contrast between Davidson students and those at a major public university, and the difference is decidedly in their favor. Davidson students come to class prepared and are not afraid to speak up.” She feels that the small classes are conducive to developing rapport with students. In addition to her professional interests (check out her book on children’s cognitive development sometime—you don’t have to be a psych major to appreciate it), Dr. Ault enjoys bicycling and spending time with her husband, who is a computer specialist in Charlotte.
