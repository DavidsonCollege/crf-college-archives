The deaths of the following Davidson Alumni were learned with sorrow, and the sympathy of The Davidsonian readers will go out to their many sorrowing kindred and friends:

Rev. Thos. B. Craig was at his home in Rock Hill at the time of his death, September 4, 1917. He graduated with the class of '76.

chosen places. On one side of the wall banners of each of the fraternities were hung with a Davidson banner in the center. On the walls perpendicular to this string of fraternity pennants were banners of the literary societies. Directly opposite was a large Davidson College banner. The decorations were completed by a large flag hung loosely from the center of the ceiling by its four corners. Loyalty to “Old Glory” and collegeSpirit seemed to have become one. The new men and many others were very informally received by the officials of the college and their wives. Everyone was smiling and seemed happy to have been the guests of the Y. M. C. A., and to have formed new acquaintances and renewed old ones. The pleasures of the evening were added to by the serving of refreshments by the young ladies of the town. The crowd disbanded about 10:30, after a very enjoyable occasion. Among those present from Davidson were: Misses Mattie Thompson, Mary Thompson, Pearl Johnson, Marie Johnson, Elizabeth Cranford, Charlotte Cranford. Those from out of town were: Misses Mary Watson Vaughn, Josephine Vaughn, Jean McAlister, all of Greensboro, N.C.

This is to certify that the Davidson College Commissary is a branch organization of the Davidson College Athletic Association and is authorized to sell all athletic goods, pennants and felt goods, belts, watch fobs, and sweaters by the said organization.

(Signed) J. M. Douglas, Chairman of Executive Committee of Davidson College Athletic Association.
