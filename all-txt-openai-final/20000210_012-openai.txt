THE DAVIDSONIAN

On the diamond in 2000

Wildcats count on depth to lead them back to playoffs

By SEAN BURKE
Staff Writer

Coming off a subpar season that featured only 11 wins in 49 games, the Davidson baseball team looks to avenge
old demons and reappear in the Southern Conference tournament. Pitching and defense should be the keys this season, according to
head coach Dick Cooke, who enters his tenth season at Davidson.

With three of Davidson’s top four pitchers returning, this staff should be in good shape. The men on the hill
are led by Wes Self, who won six games last year. Self shocked Duke last year by limiting them to
three runs in six innings (two earned) in a game where Davidson competed well, just falling short 6-5. The pitchers
complementing the staff are Ryan Stroker, Jamie McDonald, and the versatile Jeremiah Parvin, who in three years has seen action
in the outfield, the infield, and the pitcher’s mound.

The Davidson defense, likewise, has solid returning players at every infield position, including shortstop Ben Brown. Brown finished last year
as the leader in batting average (.344), hits (67), triples (4), and on-base percentage (.414). Joining Brown around the bases
are third baseman Trae Fletcher and senior first baseman power hitter Stu Sloan. Matt Torres and Cassidy Lundin will share
time at second base.

With depth and experience at every position and a chilly spring that will encourage a constant player rotation to prevent
early arm injury, it will be interesting to see who steps up this year for the baseball team. “Few positions
are set in stone,” said Cooke. The team’s depth can help it find that special chemistry that will get this
team back into the conference playoffs.

The season started earlier tonight as Davidson hosted High Point. A weekend homestand follows against Mount Saint Mary’s Feb. 11
and 12.

No WWE here, just class, determination, and a headlock

By JIMMY BURROP

Stone Cold Steve Austin. The Rock. Hulk Hogan. The Governor of Minnesota. Ian Kaplan. They are all wrestlers, all tough
guys, but only one of them lives among us. I spoke with Ian Kaplan yesterday and was impressed by what
a class act this guy is. Whereas Stone Cold can’t be trusted, and is just as likely to whack you
with a chair as shake your hand, Ian proved to me that real wrestlers are respectful and dedicated athletes.

Ian, a senior biology major from New York, has a 22-7 career record at Davidson. He wrestles in the 157-pound
weight class. Ian’s wrestling career dates back to his high school days, when he finished second in the state in
his senior year. That is mighty impressive—New York is a big ol’ state. Kaplan is coming off a big conference
win against UNC. There is no arrogance there—only drive and determination. And don’t forget the national tournament, which rolls into
St. Louis this year. After two straight years of being a wild card seed, Ian says it is “not going
to happen this year.” Ian plans on going in there locked and loaded, folks.

Ian and the other wrestlers currently practice around 15 hours a week and they watch a lot of tape, which
is a concern for Ian. Ian’s favorite move is his deadly Front Headlock and he thinks he’s going to have
to change his usage of it because he might be too predictable.Greensboro and is looking forward to some non-conference opponents
in the coming weeks. But he already has his sights set on the conference championship, scheduled for Feb. 28 in
Chattanooga, Tenn. “I fully plan on being the first seed in the conference,” said Kaplan, who was seeded third in
the tournament last year. That might sound a little Deion Sanders-ish, but when you look into this man’s eyes,

Name: Ian Kaplan
Class: Senior
Weight Class: 157
Season record: 17-6, 3-0 So Con (1st place)

The Titans know that Kurt Warner was going to pass the football and still lost? Seriously though, Ian’s dedication to
wrestling is superior to anyone I’ve ever seen. Honestly, I have never seen anyone so determined to do well. Ian
doesn’t have any rituals he does before a match; he just goes out, lays the smack down, and gets back
off the mat. And speaking of laying the smack down, Ian’s really looking forward to wrestling a particular Citadel Bulldog.
Now, I'll tell you what, I feel sorry for The Citadel folks on a regular basis, but I feel EXTRA
sorry for that poor guy. I know that I'd hate to see Ian across the mat planning to employ the
Front Headlock on me...and I even know how to do the Stone Cold Stunner.
