THE ALUMNI BANQUET

We all appreciate the spirit which has prompted the Davidson Alumni Association to arrange in Charlotte, during the Laymen's Convention,
a banquet for all those who are now, or have been, connected with the college. It seems to us another
evidence of that Davidson Spirit which is a thing remarkable, even considering the loyalty generally to be found among the
Alumni of the different colleges throughout the country. The untiring efforts of the Association, with Dr. Robt. H. Lafferty taking
a leading part, bid fair to show great results, with a large number present. It is certain that every man
who has at any time been connected with the college will be on hand if it is at all possible
for him to be there. And this is the principal thing. It is that which makes a Davidson man a
friend to every other Davidson man. Whatever may be the dividing lines in college, whenever Davidson Alumni come together, there
is a feeling of friendship which cannot be equaled anywhere else in the world. May this feeling continue and grow,
and may we who now hold in our hands those traditions of the college, which are sacred in the eyes
of every Davidson man, realize fully our responsibility and opportunity. May we, in the coming years, be able to attend
a gathering such as that to be held in Charlotte, and remember with a feeling of pride that we had
some little part in the making of Davidson stronger and more worthy of its Alumni.

BANQUET FOR MEN OF DAVIDSON CHURCH

On last Friday evening, the ladies of the local Presbyterian church tendered the men of the congregation a splendid banquet
in the Civic League rooms. The purpose of the meeting and banquet was to formulate plans for the attendance of
the local church men upon the Laymen’s Convention in Charlotte. The committee of ladies in charge, of which Mrs. Paisley
was chairman, had arranged the whole affair splendidly and furnished a banquet which was thoroughly enjoyed by everyone present. Dr.
C. M. Richards acted as toastmaster. Prof. Currie, Dr. Sentelle, Dr. Byron Clark of Salisbury, Dr. Arbuckle, Dr. Martin, Dr.
Lingle, Dr. Shearer, Mr. C. L. Grey, and Dr. Harding made speeches that added greatly to the pleasure of the
evening. About forty of the men present pledged themselves to attend the convention. At the conclusion of the evening’s meeting,
a unanimous vote of thanks was rendered to the ladies for their kindness, and a very nice donation was made
to them to be used in the furtherance of the work which they had planned to do this year.

JANUARY-FEBRUARY MAGAZINE

As a whole, the recent issue of the Magazine lacks much of reaching its usual standard. Neither in quantity nor
quality does it come up to the goal set by an ordinary college magazine. The poetry, with the exception of
“Another Chance,” is almost entirely lacking in thought and poetic expression. This one poem has the virtue of being written
with some end in view, and is to be commended for its sincerity, if nothing else. There are two stories
in this issue, “Thoughts” and “A Hollow Mystery.” The former shows a good deal of imaginative power and originality. The
one great fault to be found with “A Hollow Mystery” is that the plot is based upon the same old
skeleton in the columns standing in front of Chambers building, which has formed the foundation of so many other stories.
The writer’s style, however, is very good. Bryant’s Poetic Principles, as a discussion of this great poet's ideals, is much
too formal and dry. The writer would do well to cultivate a moreNatural manner of writing. "Longfellow's Secret of Finding
Readers and Retaining Them" portrays very well indeed the simplicity and purity of this well-loved American poet.

### DR. BYRON CLARK ADDRESSES Y. M. C. A.

A large audience greeted Dr. Byron Clark, of Salisbury, N. C., when he addressed the Y. M. C. A. last
Thursday night. Dr. Clark’s subject was, “Who Is Jesus Christ?” This was the second of the series on “The Fundamentals.”
In a clear-cut, masterful way, Dr. Clark discussed his theme under six heads: (1) Jesus, the World’s Greatest Philosopher; (2)
Jesus, the Highest Achievement of Mankind; (3) Jesus, Neither Man Nor God; (4) Jesus, the World’s Greatest Sin Bearer; (5)
Jesus, the King; (6) Jesus Must be the Object of Experience.

### DR. FULTON LECTURES

At the Sunday night service in the Presbyterian church, the annual meeting of the Davidson Bible Society was held. After
the same officers had been re-elected, Dr. M. G. Fulton gave a beautiful lecture on “Browning and the Bible.” Selecting
three of Browning's poems, “Soul of VParsish,” “The Physician,” and “The Death of John,” he outlined them and showed Browning's
dependence upon the Bible and his resulting faith.

### McGEACHY ADDRESSES MINISTERIAL BAND

An enthusiastic Ministerial Band meeting was held last Sunday night in Shearer Hall. Mr. D. M. McGeachy, always a popular
speaker among Davidson men, gave a short soul-stirring address on “Giving our all unto the Lord.” Short talks were given
also by the President of the Band and by Pierce DuBose, now attending Columbia Theological Seminary.

### THE CROWN OF CHARACTER

There is a loftier ambition than merely to stand high in the world. It is to stoop down and lift
mankind a little higher. There is a nobler character than that which is merely incorruptible. It is the character which
acts as an antidote and preventive of corruption. Fearlessly to speak the words which bear witness to righteousness and truth
and purity; patiently to do the deeds which strengthen virtue and kindle hope in your fellowmen; generously to lend a
hand to those who are trying to climb upward; faithfully to give your support and your personal help to the
efforts which are making to elevate and purify the social life of the world—that is what it means to have
salt in your character.
—Henry Van Dyke.

### WHAT THE EQUITABLE OFFERS

The policies issued by the Equitable Society are valuable:
1. Because they grant insurance that insures—protection that protects;
2. Because each policy contains all the benefits and “options” that can properly be combined in a single contract;
3. Because every policy is drawn to conform to the rigid provisions of the Law.
