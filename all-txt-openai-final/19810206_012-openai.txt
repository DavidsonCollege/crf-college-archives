John McEuen returns to 900 Room
The 900 Room will feature two different types of entertainment this weekend. Friday night John McEuen of Nitty Gritty Dirt Band fame will perform two shows, at 8 and 10 p.m. McEuen, a popular Davidson artist, will play banjo and fiddle. Tickets are now on sale at the Union desk for $3. They will be $4 at the door. Saturday night the Cripple Creek Boys, a bluegrass group, will play at 9:30 and 11 p.m. The group features family members of Elizabeth and Frank Bright.

Ken Wooden to speak on children’s plight
“This is a book that stems obviously from a deep inner compulsion, for Kenneth Wooden was a problem child, intractable, labelled retarded, saved from the human scrap heap by the remarkable woman who became his wife. Redeemed, he went to college, became a high school teacher; from personal experience he knows what can be done to salvage wasted lives. If this book disgusts and angers enough to inspire reform, he will have performed a valuable public service.”

Black History Month
The Black Student Coalition has organized a number of events for February, Black History Month. Monday night there will be “A Celebration of Life,” a poetry, song, and dance show. The show will feature...a poetry reading in canon by the Davidson Renaissance Ensemble, with members using different voice levels (soprano, alto, baritone) for different words. “A Celebration of Life” will be at 7 p.m. in the 900 Room. Admission is free, and refreshments will be served.

Next Wednesday, five foreign students will interview five Davidson black students in a public discussion entitled “Davidson: Black Perspectives.” The discussion will be at 10 a.m. in the Morrison Room. Also scheduled are an Afro-American dinner and show on Saturday, February 14, and an Open Luncheon speaker on February 18. The Union Art Gallery currently features an exhibit of Black American art.

Poet Marvin Bell will “bleed” his work to students next week. Story on page 8.

"This was the New York Times Book Review's assessment of Kenneth Wooden's book *Weeping in the Playtime of Others*, published in 1976. Wooden will speak in the 900 Room Thursday, February 5 at 8 p.m. about his investigations of the plight of America’s institutionalized children. *Weeping in the Playtime* resulted from Wooden’s study of the reading levels of juveniles in the New Jersey prison system. His research for the book took him to thirty states over a period of three years.

Wooden revealed some startling facts about institutionalized children in an interview with *People* magazine. Of the two million juveniles in the child welfare system, only about 200,000 have actually committed crimes; another 500,000 are neglected children whose parents could not or would not support them. Wooden recently published a second book, *The Children of Jonestown*. Some 300 children died in Guyana. Wooden considers the very young to have been murdered. “They didn’t take that poison voluntarily,” he said. Karl Menninger called the new book “so fine, so honest, so searching, and so moving. It is a hard dose of medicine to take, but it is medicine all Americans ought to have to take.” Wooden has appeared on CBS's “60 Minutes.” He is currently the director of the National Coalition for Children’s Justice.
