Campus prepares for AIDS memorial quilt

By Susan Warren

Nat May, President of the College Union, was introduced to the idea of producing an AIDS quilt last October when he attended an Association of College Unions meeting. May founded a host committee of 24 to 26 people who sent in a request and numerous applications throughout last year. In August, Davidson received approval to house 70 to 80 panels of the quilt. Each panel is 3 feet by 6 feet and is dedicated to someone who has died of AIDS.

The quilt will be on display in Johnston Gym from November 10 through 13. The event is free; Davidson students and the public are encouraged to attend.

By bringing the quilt to Davidson, the committee hopes to have every area of campus involved. There are many volunteer opportunities such as working at an information table, welcoming people, or being a quiet monitor. (Anyone interested in volunteering can call 892-2176.)

Students can also get involved by making a panel for the quilt. Panel making coordinator Brenda Tapia talks about panel making workshops as “trying to give people the opportunity if they would like to make a panel.” There will be four workshops held in the Gallery. They are open to students as well as the public. The first workshop will be held today; it will go over the specific materials needed and the requirements that must be met for a specific panel. The following three meetings will concentrate on actually making the panels.

While the big boys strike, Kappa Sig still swings for Habitat

By Bryan Allison

In a normal October, the two best teams in the major league would be vying for the right to be called World Champion in the always-dramatic World Series. But this is no ordinary October. Nonetheless, the strike will not prevent the brothers of Kappa Sigma from holding the seventh annual Home Runs for Habitat on October 22 at Moore Field in Mooresville.

“Home Runs for Habitat is a great way for us to give something back to the community. I hope we get a good turnout,” Kappa Sigma Service Chairman J. D. Dupuy says.

The event consists of 100 innings of softball. The game starts at 6 a.m. and traditionally finishes around 6 or 7 that evening. Generally, each fraternity brother commits to play for about three hours. In order to raise money for the event, Fundraising Chairman Brad Herndon and Dupuy have been in charge of soliciting donations from local businesses. Each member of the fundraising committee attempted to get donations from two businesses. In return for a donation, businesses' names are printed on the back of the shirts, which will be on sale at the game for $10. Proceeds benefit Habitat for Humanity. If you cannot attend but want to buy a shirt, contact J. D. Dupuy.

Over the past six years, Kappa Sigma has raised over $7000 for Habitat through this event.

Co-ed continued from page 1

Women; Davidson would be a different place. Many of the best friends students make at this school are former hall mates, and these relationships can be traced to life on a single-sex hall. Junior Katie Rogers believes that the single-sex dorms “create the closest bonds” and having co-ed dorms would hinder these bonds. Davidson is also a school with a religious-affiliated background. The type of people attracted to this school often come from families whose values coincide with Davidson’s. Would parents be inclined to send their child to live in a co-ed living environment?

Sophomore Nicola Hartery worries that this resolution could keep some students from attending Davidson for that very reason. To affirm Hartery’s concern, a parent of a freshman living in a single-sex dorm says she would not feel good about a co-ed setup. “I believe that everybody needs their privacy and modesty and wouldn’t ever want to live in a dorm again.”

These arguments and opinions will be raised at the SGA meeting Tuesday night. However, the ideal situation may not be attainable, for many agree with Maggie Cole when she says, “Co-ed or not, I wouldn’t ever want to live in a dorm again.”

After living in a co-ed dorm at Duke University his freshman year, Senior and Independent senator Jonathan Orr supports the idea “100%” and believes that the co-ed dorms could improve relations between the sexes.
