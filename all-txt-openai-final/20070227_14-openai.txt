Jason Richards ’08 led Davidson with 21 points and five assists, including five three-pointers, as the Wildcats survived a rare
quiet night from Stephen Curry ’10 to earn a road victory over Big South Conference leader Winthrop on Friday night.
The game was part of ESPN’s Bracketbuster Event, which pits some of the nation’s best mid-major programs against each other.
With the win, the ’Cats improved to 21-6 (18-0 in SoCon) on the season.

The Wildcats jumped out to a 6-0 lead in the opening minute behind three-pointers from Richards and Curry. The Eagles
rallied to tie the score at 8-8, but the ’Cats responded with a 12-0 run to open up a 20-8
lead that they would never relinquish as Davidson never trailed in the contest. Curry was relegated to the bench for
the majority of the first period after he was whistled for his second foul at the 10:14 mark, but the
Eagles were not able to take advantage with the nation’s fifth leading scorer on the bench. Richards picked up the
scoring slack for Curry, as he finished the first half with 14 points. Davidson’s defense controlled the Winthrop attack for
the remainder of the half and the ’Cats entered halftime with a 31-21 lead.

The Eagles opened the second half with a three-pointer by Michael Jenkins to cut the Wildcat lead to 31-24, but
that was as close as Winthrop would get. The score remained close until Curry knocked down his first three-pointer of
the contest with 11:44 to play in regulation to push the ’Cats lead to 44-31.

To quote from his ESPN profile, “Kyle Whelliston was the first two-year editor-in-chief in the history of The Psychedelic Lawnmower,
the student newspaper of High Mowing School (N.H.). He then attended the following, in chronological order: the University of Oregon,
lots of Grateful Dead shows, a home game for every Major League Baseball team,” Drexel University, and 100 college basketball
games.

SoCon Men’s Basketball Standings

D: Where does Max Paulhus Gosselin rank among defensive forwards in the mid-major ranks?

KW: I can’t say, because we haven’t created stats yet to properly measure the accomplishments of a guy like Max.
It seems like he’s a part of every play when he’s out on the floor. All I know is that
every time I cover a Davidson game, I write his name down at least seven or eight times for doing
something good, but then I look at the box score and he’s scored three or four points.

D: I saw on your marathon chat that someone asked you about Steve Rossiter. After another look at him on
Friday, how do you assess his contributions to this team this year?

KW: He’s never going to be a superstar, but there will always be matchups he can exploit, like in the
N.C. Central game and the first game with Wofford. I hope he develops into a good role player in his
final two years.

D: How do you think mid-major schools will fare in the NCAA tournament this year compared to last season?

KW: One thing we saw a lot of last year was regular season champions going to the NIT instead of
winning the autobid via the league tourney, unlike in 2006. As a result, there weren’t a lot of low-seed upsets.
Winning both the regular-season title and tourney championship is a good measure of a team’s upset chances, and the volume
of upsets will likely hinge on the number of double champions.

D: Davidson is now just outside the AP Top 25 poll. If they are ranked going into the conference tournament
and falter, do you think they will still...

The Wildcat basketball team pulled off an amazing overtime comeback against Wofford for an 84-76 victory but could not continue
its four-game winning streak against Furman, losing 77-66. Julia Paquette ’10 matched her career high mark against Wofford, scoring 23
points to lead Davidson. Alex Thompson and Mercedes Robinson ’09 also hit double digits, tallying 18 and 14 points, respectively.
Robinson also collected 13 rebounds to secure her league-leading twelfth double-double of the season. Wofford also boasted three players with
double figures, with Natalie Gramblin leading her team with 15. But individual performances fail to capture Davidson’s resilience in the
face of adversity. The Wildcats went into halftime down 10 points after shooting a miserable 20% from the field. Furthermore,
four out of five starters fouled out by the end of the game.Despite these obstacles, the team clawed its way
back. Down only 68-65 with 40 seconds left in the second half, Paquette and Robinson both hit clutch jump shots
to extend the game to bonus basketball.

Basketball scores two key victories

Despite the early foul trouble and being double-teamed for the majority of the night, the sophomore guard still scored 12
points and added eight rebounds as he extended his streak of double-digit scoring efforts to 54 games. Davidson continued to
stymie the Eagles on defense and cruised the rest of the second half on their way to securing the 60-47
victory. The Wildcats were able to survive a poor 36% shooting night with an inspired defensive effort led by Max
Paulhus-Gosselin ’09, who led the ’Cats with three steals and was particularly effective on Winthrop’s inbounds plays, forcing five turnovers.
Andrew Lovedale ’09 had another solid effort contributing nine points and leading the team with 10 rebounds. The Wildcats are
undefeated since inserting Lovedale into the starting line-up on Jan. 3 and with No. 2 Memphis’ loss to Tennessee this
weekend, Davidson now owns the longest winning streak in the country at 17 games. The ’Cats will look to extend
their 28-game regular season Southern Conference winning streak as they finish up conference play this week. Tonight the Wildcats take
on North Division-leading Appalachian State as they play their final home game. The ’Cats are riding a 16-game home winning
streak and have won 40 of their last 42 against SoCon opponents in Belk Arena. The home finale is also
“Senior Night” at Davidson as the senior tri-captains Richards, Boris Meno ’08, and Thomas Sander ’08 will be honored before
the game. The Wildcats finish up their regular season Saturday at Georgia Southern before heading to Charleston, S.C. for the
Southern Conference Tournament to be played March 7-10. Although the ’Cats sit just outside both the AP Top 25 and
USA Today/ESPN Poll, they will probably need to defend their tournament title to secure a spot in the NCAA Tournament’s
field of 65.

Max Paulhus-Gosselin ’09 played shutdown defense against Winthrop in the ESPN Bracketbusters game.

Comeback SoCon victory key for ’Cats

In overtime, the Wildcats again found themselves with a disadvantage, down 75-71. After three made free throws by Monica Laune
’10 and Kelsey Cary ’11, the ball found its way to the corner where Thompson drained the decisive three-point bucket.
After an insurance lay-up from Kelly Gassie ’09, who tied her personal record for rebounding with seven, and solid free
throw shooting, the game concluded with the Wildcats ahead 84-76. Unfortunately, the Wildcats could not maintain their momentum on the
road against Furman. Alex Thompson ’10 led the ’Cats with 13 points. Paquette and Danielle Hemerka ’08 also broke into
double-digits. With 11 points against the Paladins, Hemerka moved into seventh place on the all-time scoring list with 1,083 points.
A 20-10 run over a nine-minute stretch allowed the Wildcats to shrink the lead to one, 63-62 at the 2:11
mark. After two Furman free throws, Hemerka brought the Wildcats back to within two at 65-63 with a free throw
at the 1:17 mark. Unfortunately, Davidson could get no closer to the Paladins. Furman hit five of their last seven
free throw attempts to seal the victory at 70-66. Davidson travels Thursday to play Georgia Southern in its last road
game of the season.
