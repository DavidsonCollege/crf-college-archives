ESSAY CONTEST

...science to guide him, but the Devil (if his henchmen can overcome conscience) enslaves man’s soul to such an extent that it is extremely difficult for his soul to be rescued. The Prince of this world has now become firmly entrenched and has captured the souls of many powerful men on earth. But if an understanding of his methods is obtained and the righteous general, Conscience (who is fighting in the name of the Most High Commander of Righteousness), is accomplished; then Satan’s power can be weakened and some of the souls which he has enslaved can be set free. Certainly, at least, this awakening would make it much harder for him to capture and subjugate more hapless souls.

CHARTER GIVEN

...strong world government. The most noted of the six is Dr. Albert Einstein. On the campus, plans are being made to put the issue before the public. Details on this will be released within two weeks.

AN OPEN LETTER...
(Continued From Page Two)

...workers on the business and circulation staffs, Columnists Rees Owens, John McLean, Bob Hollister, Dave Gambrell, Hartley Hall, Randy Taylor, Warren Sims, Phil Mitchell, Bill Turnipseed, Scott Jenkins, Arnie Covell, Bill Pate and many others too numerous to mention. Behind the scenes are others who also contributed a great deal, our printer, Mr. H. C. Stewart and his capable wife, Mr. Dan Broyles, the jeweler, and Ray Henderson, the long-suffering ones who saw to it that the paper was printed each week by contributing their varied talents unselfishly at all hours of the day and night. They solved many of our problems, and endured our continued tardiness with a smile. Last, but not least, I thank the student body as a whole for their many helpful comments and criticisms. I am sure that you will give this same support to your new editor. I am confident that in turn he will serve you well.

WHY... I smoke Chesterfield
(FROM A SERIES OF STATEMENTS BY PROMINENT TOBACCO FARMERS)
“I think Chesterfield is the best cigarette on the market. I’ve smoked them for about 20 years. It’s mild and it’s got more real tobacco taste.
“Liggett & Myers buy the middle leaves... it’s the best leaf... it’s mellow... it’s got to be ripe. They consistently pay above the average to get the tobacco they want.”
