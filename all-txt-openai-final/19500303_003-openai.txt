**“SPRING FROLICS QUEEN” CONTEST ANNOUNCED**

**PROFESSOR CHEATHAM IS Ex-GI, Davidson Seeks Beauty To Reign During Dance Set at Davidson**

The Davidsonian, with the cooperation of the Pan-Hellenic Council, has this year decided to inaugurate what we hope will become
an annual affair and an integral part of that much-discussed “Davidson Tradition.” This year, for the first time, there will
be held, under the auspices of the Davidsonian, a beauty contest, the winner of which will be crowned “Queen for
a day” at the formal dance during the Spring Frolics set on April 21. Davidsonians have always prided themselves on
the beauty of the young ladies who grace our campus on social occasions throughout the year, and it has been
decided that we should formally recognize the most delectable of these delightful lasses with a suitable ceremony. The winning contestants
will be chosen by a panel of judges composed of Drs. Boyd, Davidson, and McGavock. The winner will be crowned
queen at the formal dance by the president of the student body, Whit Cobb, and the three runners-up will compose
her court. The pictures of all of the finalists will appear in the Davidsonian prior to the final crowning of
the Queen. Here are the rules for making entries in this contest:

1. Any student at Davidson College, except members of the Davidsonian Staff, is eligible to present an entry.
2. All of those girls entered as contestants must be able to attend Spring Frolics.
3. To be considered by the judges, a portrait-type picture accompanied by a full-length snapshot must be submitted of each
contestant.
4. The name and address of each entrant, together with the name of the person submitting said entry, must accompany
the photographs.
5. All entries must be submitted not later than April 1st to Bob Hollister, Room D West.

**Humanities Hold Key To Our Future, Says Princeton's Dodds**

Princeton, N.J. — (I.P.) — Deploring the decline of liberal education in the nation’s universities, Dr. Harold W. Dodds, president
of Princeton University, recently said that “if widespread knowledge and appreciation of the humanities disappear, our modern civilization can only
return to a new dark age of sordid, animal existence.” President Dodds declared that the College of Liberal Arts and
Sciences remains “our most promising social agency for combating a worm’s eye view of life.” He attacked the faulty teaching
of the humanities as suffering from hardening of the intellectual arteries and said a liberal education is the “golden theme”
which fits man to be a competent leader in the broad area of human affairs. Dr. Dodds said that Colleges
of Liberal Arts and Sciences in the country’s universities are divided as to methods and objectives, with a future more
uncertain than that of vocational and professional schools. “Yet it is through the liberal studies that one comes into association
with the uncommon and the great in our intellectual inheritance,” he said. Dr. Dodds pointed to literature, art, history, and
philosophy as expressing a nature which is basically and exclusively human. He declared that “politics, economics, and sociology can never
ignore this fact.”

**Wisconsin Students Air Views of Faculty Procedure on Exams**

Madison, Wis. — (I.P.) — A recent discussion by the University of Wisconsin’s Committee on University Functions and Policies centered
on Chapter 4 of the Committee’s voluminous “report card,” which has aroused nationwide interest since its publication last fall. The
committee found that in size of teaching sections, “you just can’t win.” “Sometimes the University is charged with such great
size that the individual receives no attention and other times with wasting money on many small classes.” The committee felt
that in the University now there are a number of lectures that are too large, the size of quiz and
laboratory sections in large courses is reasonably satisfactory.

**Alexander Questions ‘Y’ Program Progress**

Are you familiar with the program of your YMCA? The YMCA is keenly aware of the problem this question involves.
Recently the hall prayer meeting leaders conducted a discussion on the work of the YMCA designed to accentuate both positive
and adverse criticism. Randy Taylor, cabinet leader in charge of spiritual development, carefully compiled the student opinion as recorded, which
was presented to the cabinet as a whole. The details were scrutinized thoughtfully by the Cabinet but particularly revelatory was
the general feeling that the student body did not know enough about the “Y”. Possibly there are two extenuating reasons:
first, the YMCA is not yet physically in the center of student body life; second, the publicizing of an organization
as complex and extensive as the YMCA has its limitations. One of the principal limitations is the propensity of students
to exonerate themselves of all blame. Beginning with this issue, the DAVIDSONIAN is carrying an article every week on some
phase of YMCA work. Students are invited to find out more about their YMCA’s activities by looking for this article
and reading it intelligently.

**Library Featuring New Books**

The Davidson College Library has received within recent days a number of new books which are proving popular with student
readers. Among these books are several on the subjects of Art, which is this month's display in the Reference Room,
and Music. If you are looking for laughs as well as an understanding of the problem of what others think
of the United States, try, “Out of the Crocodile’s Mouth” a collection of Russian cartoons depicting life in America as
seen through Russian eyes. The collection which is made of cartoons appearing in the Moscow humor magazine “Krokodil” is edited
by William Nelson and although only recently released has been acclaimed by critics as one of the finest books of
its type ever printed. It is a wonderful presentation of “misrepresentation.” In the field of serious Art, the library has
added what has been termed by many “one of the greatest achievements in the field of art publication,” “The Paintings
of El Greco.” El Greco is the most modern of all the Old Masters and this publication is a truly
monumental edition, designed to do ample justice to his importance. This volume contains plates of all the Master's principal works,
together with one hundred detail reproductions, mostly in their actual size. Thus for the first time El Greco's works can
really be “seen.” For those who like their history presented in a pictorial as well as literary form and for
those who enjoy excellent photography, “Art and Life In America” by Oliver W. Larkin is just the ticket. Here is
presented the history of this country from its beginning to the present.

**ST. LOUIS, VETERAN FOOTBALL EXPONENT, DROPS GAME FROM SPORTS LIST AFTER INQUIRY**

St. Louis, Mo. (I.P.) — Saint Louis University, which participated in the first intercollegiate football game west of the Mississippi
in 1888, has dropped football “for the immediate future,” according to the Very Rev. Paul C. Reinert, S. J., president.
“The University is unwilling to submit to scholastic compromises,” Father Reinert declared in announcing the decision. “Experience seems to show
that today if a large university is to meet its highly specialized football rivals on an equal basis, it is
almost imperative that scholastic sacrifices be deliberately accepted.” Pointing out that “the proportions that college football has assumed today demand
that an institution place its program on a rigorous business basis,” Father Reinert said:a private institution of higher learning which
in view of present economic trends is forced to husband its funds with the utmost diligence, any channeling of resources
from essential academic objectives of general and professional training into areas of secondary importance such as intercollegiate football could not
be justified.” Action was taken following a poll of alumni leaders, regents and deans, faculty members, and the board of
trustees, Father Reinert said. The poll revealed nearly unanimous sentiment to abolish football if it meant sacrificing scholastic standards and
building needs.

Heads Heart Ass'n; Describes Ailments

New Haven, Conn. — The general public must be taught the truth about heart disease so that individuals will “not
be frightened,” according to a Yale University doctor. Dr. Harold M. Marvin, President of the American Heart Association, an Alumnus
of Davidson College, asserted that medical investigators have learned that so-called “heart attacks” are not fatal or disabling except in
a small percentage of cases, that high blood pressure is not the terrifying condition it was once thought to be,
and that thousands of men and women with heart disease are leading active lives without discomfort.

“An intelligent understanding,” Dr. Marvin said, “would lead thousands of lay people to participate in the work of local groups,
where they are sorely needed. After all, this battle against our greatest health problem must be fought by all the
people, not just by the doctors; unless thousands of citizens give their help we cannot hope for an early or
decisive victory.”

Dr. Marvin, who is also Associate Clinical Professor of Medicine at Yale, discussed the fight against heart disease on the
weekly radio program “Yale Interprets the News,” over Station WTIC. Although deaths from heart disease have been on the increase,
Dr. Marvin looked upon the overall picture as “far more encouraging” than one might expect from the death rates alone.

The Yale heart expert described the five types of heart illnesses that are frequent enough to be considered health problems.
They are: (1) congenital heart disease — the kind that is present at birth, and accounts for two or three
percent of all heart disease; (2) the type caused by syphilis, responsible for six to eight percent; (3) rheumatic heart
disease, accounting for 90 percent of all heart disease in childhood and early adult life; (4) the type caused by
high blood pressure; and (5) the kind caused by hardening or narrowing of the coronary arteries.

Congenital heart disease and the kind caused by high blood pressure are not increasing, Dr. Marvin stated. Syphilitic heart disease
has decreased in recent years and there are indications that rheumatic heart disease also is slowly declining. Dr. Marvin explained
that arteriosclerosis — hardening of the arteries — occurs largely in advanced ages. The average age of American people has
increased “almost unbelievably” since 1900. More and more people are living to 60, 70, 75, or even 80 years. “At
these ages one must expect death to come from one of the diseases or conditions common to later life, and
of these, hardening of the arteries is the commonest,” he said.

ATHLETE, SCHOLAR, MUSICIAN

Professor Paul G. Cheatham of the psychology department is another first-year man on the faculty. A native of Lynchburg, Virginia,
Prof. Cheatham attended the University of his home state, receiving his B.A. in 1943. The same year saw him beginning
three years duty with the Army which carried him to France and Germany. While with the infantry in France he
studied French at the University of Dijon. Out of the Army, he assumed his work at the University of Virginia,
earning his M.A. in 1947 and a Ph.D. in 1949.

While in college Prof. Cheatham was interested in gymnastics and was a member of the tumbling team; he also did
some coaching. He was engaged in YMCA work and a member of “Y” Cabinet. Music is his hobby number one,
and his interest is expressed on the violin. During occupation duty in Western Europe, he was a member of the
G.I. Symphony and toured the occupation areas on concerts. He has continued his musical activities since coming to Davidson by
becoming a member of the Charlotte Symphony.

For the past two years, Prof. Cheatham has been engaged in a research program for the Air Force in the
field of communication. He is now doing research for the Carnegie Foundation in the field of Visual Perception and is
interested in the field of general psychology tests and measurements. Prof. Cheatham says that his work at Davidson is very
pleasant and that he is now settled. While he has had some previous experience in laboratory work, this is his
first job of actual teaching. It may be rather late in the year to welcome Prof. Cheatham to the campus;
nevertheless we do so, and hope that his work will continue to be pleasant.
