Memories of my childhood are vague and strange.
I remember the big wooded lot across from us, across from the
gravel grey road, our dead-end street. In the big wooded lot
of dark green pines and brown shaggy needles,

in the middle, was a ditch of red clay,

full of dust and clumps of dirt.

And I remember my brother throwing these clumps at me,

and I threw some back, and we both laughed though I never
wanted to hit him.

The dirt clods would spray dust when they hit someone.

And the gravel grey road was dusty, too, particularly in the
unrelenting winds of summer.

The gravel was hotter and harder.

Hotter and harder than the dirt clods.

With fine shiny specks, I remember holding a sharp piece of
gravel and I remember thinking how pretty and full of bright
S. Gravel sat in the gravelly dusty road and the
blistering breeze would kick up a dust devil.

Like a baby twister striving for greatness, whirling harder
and harder and then just evaporating.

Disappearing.

Leaving a few pine needles moved and rearranging the dust
a little.

But my childhood was not dry, hard, or dusty. Gosh, I was
green and wet, soft and cool.

Green and wet, soft and cool because I liked feeling hot and
feeling hard and feeling dusty. I liked feeling. I liked
touching.

But those damn dust devils I never touched.

I ran after them and they were gone.

Or I ran up to them, and then we would face each other,
contemplating.

And they would turn away and slip into another world,
shuffling off their clothes of dust and needles and

naked, I could see them not at all.

But I felt their hot breath.

Memories of childhood are vague and strange.

I remember the big wooded lot.

And the gravel road.

And the dust.

And the heat of my imagination.

“Archbishop Beck of Liverpool says ‘to turn
the other
cheek is a counsel of perfection addressed
to individuals
not to governments!” News Item.

Ever since Jesus added, “turn the other cheek,” to his
strange notions,
The godly and learned men of every creed and clan
have said this counsel of perfection does not apply to
nations,
but was meant only as a rule for individual man.

Jesus would think it paradoxical and ironical,
and if consequences were not too horrible to contemplate,
he would say it is most comical,
that this learned interpretation man will soon invalidate.

When nuclear bombs are built by every nation,
as soon must be if they are to keep their pride,
then there will be an entirely new situation,
and all must turn the other cheek or commit suicide.

On the Verge

Indians move
burros
up and down deserted mountains.
Blue-corn tortillas
wrinkle on the fire
like nubile children
in the heat of the day.

Wind blows hemlock
and mushrooms grow unaided.
Overhead,
hawks circle.

Rats scurry into shacks.
Pigs squeal,
as if caught in the balance,
as if on the verge
of something
in
Mexico.
