**Work On Library To Begin In June**
By JOHN CASSELS
Staff Writer

The E. H. Little Library is scheduled to be under construction by June 1-15. Physical Plant Director Grover C. Meetze
is presently completing specifications to be submitted to contractors next week.

Earlier in the spring, the physical plant personnel inspected the present union for capital equipment to be salvaged when the
union is razed. The mechanical systems, i.e., electronic equipment and sound panels, will be moved to the Guest House, which
will be the temporary union next year. Hardware and doors will be saved if there is immediate future use for
them, but costs of long-term storage are prohibitive. The cost-of-labor rise over the last few years has done away with
the worth of salvaging brick.

Details of the library were received by the college last week. The Library Planning Committee is now checking them for
errors. Within the next week, Meetze hopes to be able to turn over the approved blueprints, along with the specifications
for the razing and salvaging of the union, to Clark, Nexsen, and Owen. The architectural firm will then submit the
plans and specifications to contractors on a prepared list. The contractors will submit sealed bids within three or four weeks
for the entire job of razing the union and building the new library. Since bids will not be opened until
the latter part of May, the contractor will operate on a tight schedule. It is expected, however, that the union
will be razed and construction begun on the library by June 15.

**Absentee Votes Due For May 6 Primary**
By DAVID ARANT

The 1972 elections are the first in which absentee ballots will be available for the North Carolina primary elections. Those
students wishing to exercise their voting power may wish to follow the prescribed procedure to vote absentee in the May
6, 1972, primary election.

Anyone who is registered to vote in North Carolina, affiliated with a political party, and expects to be out of
the county on voting day may request an application for an absentee ballot. This request must be received by the
county election board before May 2. The election board will then send an Official Application which must be returned by
mail. The board will then send the absentee ballot. After voting, the ballot must be notarized and then returned to
the election board before noon, May 3.

**Sandwich Man Berger Keeps Tradition Going**
By RICHARD ROMEYN

Through the cool of the evening sounds the call of the sandwich man—knock, knock “selling sandwiches.” Or as Shakespeare said,
“What say you to a piece of beef and mustard?”

The sandwich man—as he is known to most, is Jim Berger, a senior and in his second year of selling
sandwiches (he also sold them as a sophomore). He is not the first and may not be the last to
do so. Sandwiches in some form have been sold in the dorms for at least thepast four years, and Berger
says, “They will continue to be sold by someone as long as it is profitable.” It is profitable. Berger makes
and sells five dozen sandwiches five days a week. He estimates that a sandwich costs him “somewhere in the neighborhood
of 30 to 33 cents to make.” They are sold for $.50, and Berger makes about $50 each week. He
sees it as an opportunity to turn his “labor into profit,” but also feels he is providing a service by
selling them.

Two years ago the price of a sub sandwich was 40 cents. It has been as low as 35 cents
in the last few years. Berger says that most of his customers don't complain about the price, and he feels
he gives value for the money. The rising cost of meat and bread was cited by him as causing the
increase in sandwich prices. “I spend between three and four hours each day in making and selling sandwiches,” says Berger,
but he doesn’t think the job places a burden on his studying.

He has found that in a normal week sandwiches sell best on Sunday and Thursday nights, and for some reason,
Tuesdays are very slow. Of the three types of sandwiches which he sells, Berger says that subs have traditionally been
in the most demand. However, he added, “right now it is neck and neck between all three types.” In addition
to the subs, Berger sells beef and turkey sandwiches.

“At the beginning of the year freshmen were the biggest buyers,” Berger said. “But now sophomores and especially Belk Dorm
buy the most. Of the freshman dorms, Watts buys very few, and Cannon buys the most. Sentelle falls somewhere in
between the two.” A hard core of addicts buy sandwiches every night, however. Berger notes that a majority buy them
about three out of the five days that he sells them.

Berger finds his job enjoyable. “Everybody is interesting to talk to and I get to walk around and if anything
is happening I get to see it,” he said, “and I’ve walked or been invited in on just about everything.”
Berger says he has noticed that people always want a sandwich after smoking grass. “I guess marijuana breeds hunger and
hunger breeds sandwich buying.”
