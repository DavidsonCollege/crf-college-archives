**Orientation introduces freshmen to service learning**

Close to 550 Davidson students and faculty joined together Aug. 23 for a day of hard work as they participated
in this year’s Freshman Orientation service project. Introduced three years ago by former Service Coordinator Katherine Turner, the program places
incoming freshmen in 10-person groups and sends them on their way to one of over 35 locations in and around
Davidson to provide service to their new community.

In the pre-service informational session, the goals for the day were identified as “a chance to become better acquainted with
faculty and staff, the surrounding community, the concept of community service and service learning, to form relationships as a group,
and to have fun.”

While the service component of Orientation is not a new concept, the hands-on approach definitely is. In earlier years, the
Orientation service component focused on learning about service rather than actually being involved in an activity. Associate Dean of Students
Lelise Marsicano said, “We wanted incoming students to understand how important service is at Davidson, to both the students and
the community, and the information sessions were ineffective at conveying that idea.”

New Service Coordinator Bill Abrams worked with the Harmony committee, a group of faculty and staff, in coordinating Saturday’s activities.
After numerous phone calls and hours of planning, the service department settled on specific sites which included clean-up at the
Ada Jenkins Community Center, serving lunch at the Union to the Uptown Men’s Homeless Shelter, and gathering food for the
Loaves and Fishes project run throughout the Davidson community service office. Criteria for sites included a two-hour project, a designated
site coordinator, a focus, and most importantly, a real need for task-oriented service.

Freshman response to the service project was overwhelmingly positive, a reflection of the 85% of students who reported being active
in community service on their admission applications. Many students appreciated the opportunity to see the town and its citizens, and
to meet other first-year students outside their halls.

“The day was a bonding experience not only with other students but with the whole community,” freshman Catherine Hamilton said.
“It gave me my first chance to get involved.”

Other students were impressed with their group’s results. “Initially, I didn’t think we’d get much done,” said freshman Robert Trottman,
who spent the day landscaping. “But I was surprised by the amount we accomplished as a group.”

**Coed dorms come to campus**

When the Class of 2001 applied last winter, they were not yet aware of the shift to coed housing. Only
upon enrollment, when first-year students received their roommate preference cards, were they presented with the coed or single-sex option. Because
RLO did not want to inconvenience students who chose Davidson with the understanding that they would live in a single-sex
dorm, those students who opted for single-sex dorms were guaranteed residency in either Cannon or Little dormitories.

The number of students who chose single-sex housing was so “astoundingly low,” though, that many who wanted coed living arrangements
had to settle for the less popular single-sex dorms. The tiered effect of dorms like Belk is really a credit
to the numbers rather than pointed planning by staff. For instance, men who live on second east Belk may be
living directly across the hall from women spanning second west and center. In fact, the close proximity of men and
women has made for some distracting situations.

“It’s hard not being able to walk down the hall in a towel, and always remember to close your door
when you’re changing,” freshman Harriet Weatherbee said. Jessica Blackburn added, “You have to be prepared for anything because you never
know when guys might wander by.”

Guys hang out in Richardson, previously an all-female dorm.Far as easing tensions between members of the opposite sex, coed housing
is well on its way toward its goal. As Junior Christina Beidermann, a hall counselor on first west Belk, noted,
“Coed living expands friendships more so than ever because it erases the taboo of having visitors in freshman halls.” Hall
counselor Paul Dreyden agreed: “I’ve noticed the difference between this year and my freshman year. The interaction between men and
women is vastly improved.”

Sigma Phi Epsilon garners national award
By CHRISTINE LARNED

Few people have probably heard of the “Buck Cup,” but for one campus fraternity, it signifies excellence among all its
chapters. Davidson’s Sigma Phi Epsilon chapter seized the prized Buchanan Cup at the national Sig Ep conclave in Phoenix, Ariz.
Tripp Franklin, the fraternity’s president, accompanied fellow members Ryan McClellan and Jason McMullen to Phoenix to vie for the highly
competitive and esteemed award among the 278 national Sig Ep chapters. Only 39—about 10%—of the chapters receive the award. Accordingly,
the Buchanan Cup is the highest award any chapter can win. To get the award, the fraternity had to complete
an application that makes Davidson’s own look like Mad Libs. The criteria that the committee scrutinizes peers into the core
of the fraternity. The committee examines the collective academic, athletic, and civic accomplishments of each Sig Ep chapter. The award
is offered every two years so the distinction remains current. The 1997 Buck Cup is the second consecutive cup Sig
Ep has captured and third it has won overall. It also received the award at the 1995 meeting in Orlando.
“I’m proud for the brotherhood,” Franklin said. “The entire house earned the award. We are all glad to get recognition
for this highly respected award.”

Coed dorms comparable to Davidson admitting women
By DAVID JOHNSTON

Among the numerous changes that the beginning of the school year traditionally brings, there is one extremely visible departure from
past years at Davidson. This year marks the first time coed dorms can be found campus-wide, spearheaded by the integration
of historically-male Belk dormitory. Twenty-five years ago this fall marks the first time that female students were admitted as diploma
candidates to the college. Fifty-seven women students moved on campus for the 1972-1973 academic year; of those 57, 29 were
working toward their diplomas. Women had attended classes at Davidson since the fall of 1970 under the auspices of the
Eight College Exchange program. The program made it possible for students from eight single-sex schools in the Upper South to
attend classes at a school for the opposite sex for one year. Participating along with Davidson were: Hollins, Mary Baldwin,
Randolph Macon Women’s, Sweet Briar, Hampden-Sydney, Randolph-Macon, and Washington & Lee. “We’ve been in convents all our lives,” exchange student
Grange Roller, a junior from Mary Baldwin, told the Davidsonian at the time. “So we’ve decided to come to a
monastery for a year.” Throughout 1971, the Davidsonian chronicled the numerous petitions, bills, and debates which traveled about the campus.
In the spring of 1972, the college Trustees voted unanimously to open the school up to coeducational instruction the following
year. A target of 100 students was set. The impending arrival of the undetermined number of coeds sparked debate at
the “monastery” as did the changes of 1972—with about where the women should be housed. Then Director of Housing Scotty
Nicholls was the most vocal proponent of housing them on 3rd and 4th Little. This plan was met with opposition
from the students, most notably Gray Wilson. “The facilities in Little are too adequate,” he wrote in his editorial on
April 28, 1972. “Several installments will lie fallow in the restrooms.” Hopefully, this year the coed living arrangements in the
dorms will serve to better the College—a minimum of “fallow installments.”
