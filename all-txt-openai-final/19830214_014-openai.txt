Ceiling Lights

I admire the far temperance of roads —
in their castling macadam ties

I rather enjoy the curving splendor of skies
casting denim shadows and days

Yet, what is life

but for the ceiling lights of twilight and dawn...

The pointness of those tiny rainbow robes:
Alien vignettes at home with me.

Yes, I’ve tasted the seductive dust of civilization
marching two abreast on roads,

And I've never lost the cloudlessness of days,
But midnight has more ceiling lights for me.

—James Moore '84

I see the outlets on the wall.

I wonder, should those outlets fall

Away, what would the ending be?

Would wires tumble, sparks fly free?
Would carpet singe, would flooring burn?
Would flames then billow, smoke be churned?
The charm of electricity

Has fostered insecurity.

And yet I plug my dryer in

Or watch my records slowly spin.

My television hums and glows.

My iron demurely presses clothes.

So why this urge to take a dare

And pry away the outlets there?

Perhaps it’s just a need for strife.

I want a fire in my life.
