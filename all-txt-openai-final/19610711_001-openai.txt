#### WEDNESDAY NIGHT BREAK

The break this week will again be held in spite of the fickleness of the weather. The featured items this
week are lemonade and a Slushee variety of mixed garbage (a term covering that food variously called snicker-snacks, crunchies, or
"that stuff").

Next week the Wednesday night break will be held on Tuesday night due to the exam schedule. At that break,
there will again be hostesses from the surrounding area.

#### COMMITTEES NEED HELP

Two summer Union committees are in need of additional members. The Wednesday Night Break Committee, now chaired by Miss Jean
Abernethy and G.P. Nowlin, is in search of two additional people.

This paper also requires two more hands to write features and assist in the typing and distribution of the paper.

There will be a meeting of those wishing to assist these groups in the Green Room at 2100 on Wednesday.

This is a good opportunity to get in a little outside activity to break the routine.

#### Mr. Gore. Nowlin

The familiar sign to us all, which says, "This stand is run on an honor system â€” please co-operate," is
one that should be food for thought. Honor system is a much hackneyed term these days and has come to
often mean a system whereby one is relieved of his own responsibilities because others are on their honor to carry
them out.

Hence, I do not have to take care of my personal belongings, and I may leave them about the campus
in a most haphazard way. This I do in peace because Davidson is run on an honor system. In this
respect, life at college is much like life with mother. At home, I could leave things about the house with
the expectation that mother would pick them up and put them in their proper place. Now that mother is miles
away, the honor system is expected to do the same thing for me.

If this seems unreasonable, look about you at the umbrellas, clothing, and books that are strewn around the campus. Each
of these articles represents an owner that feels that the honor system has relieved him of the minimum responsibilities of
ownership.

And, a last word: the honor system makes no allowance for transients on the campus, cases of mistaken identity of
objects, or acts of God (which, in the form of rainstorms, seem to be frequent this summer).

#### THIS WEEK'S MOVIE

The movie this week is to be John Ford's adaptation of Steinbeck's "Grapes of Wrath," starring Henry Fonda.
