THE DAVIDSONIAN, MAY 5, 1923

AS THE ATHLETIC EDITOR SEES IT
BY RAYMOND LAKE

Another State championship team! We stated in this column last week that one championship team a year is about all that could very well be expected from one school, but now the tennis team has come through and proven that the Wildcats can do things which are not expected. McCutchen and Carr worked together last week with the old Wildcat spirit and took the State title in the doubles tennis matches. Roddey went to the finals and came very near winning the State's singles title. The Wildcats have really “strutted” this year—State champions in football and State champions in the tennis doubles. The baseball team has lost quite a few games this year, and the track team has not won all of its meets, but we can’t complain about that. Two championship teams in one year is enough to be justly proud of. This is the third straight time the Wildcats have won the doubles championship, and this enables them to keep the cup.

The inclement weather last Saturday may have kept one more upset from taking place in the sport world. The Blue Devil cinder path stars were favored to win over the Wildcats by most of those interested, but the Wildcat team was in excellent shape and there's no telling what might have happened. In the dashes, the Wildcats can come in with the best of them and ahead of most of them, and the distance men have been improving steadily. It was hard on several of the men who needed points to have the meet called off; but perhaps it was better to call it off than to try to run it under the existing conditions.

Following in the steps of the Blue Devils, the Elon College baseball team defeated the Wildcats for the second consecutive time last week in a slow and ragged contest. The Elon players made a good start, scoring four runs in the first inning, and held their lead throughout the game. A strong wind forced the officials to halt the game several times for a few minutes, and this made it even more ragged. The State game last Thursday was quite a bit different from the Elon game. Both teams were going good and were working together well and fighting hard. The game was interesting from the start to the finish as the extra inning which was played shows. The Wolfpack players outhit the Wildcats, but the home team worked better in the field, making fewer errors, and came out on the long end of an 11 to 10 score.

The Tar Heel nine showed rare form in the game last Friday when they won over the ’Cats by an 11 to 0 score in a no-hit game. The Tar Heel pitcher allowed only 29 men to face him during the entire game, and the other members of his team backed him up well and allowed none of the Wildcat players to get further than second base. These defeats which the baseball team is suffering seem mighty bad at first, but again we say that we have no room to complain when the Wildcats have put two championship teams in the field this year. Baseball is a major sport, but it is not near so popular as football, and in the latter sport, the Wildcats stand at the top this year, and have a good chance to hold their position next year, especially since Monk and Tex have announced their intention of staying with us for the next five years.

The Freshman nine has also been suffering some defeats. They lost all three of their games on the last trip, one to the Baby Deacons, one to the Tar Babies, and the other to the Blue Devil Freshman, by an overwhelming score. McGinnis, one of the best of the Wildkitten nine, was not able to play in all of these games, however, on account of an injury to his shoulder. Had he been able to take his place in the box, the story might have been a different one in several instances.

Elon Players Down ’Cats in Last Game

The Davidson Wildcats lost their second game to Elon on Wednesday afternoon, April 27, by a score of 8 to 4. Play had to be suspended several times during the game until dust clouds had settled down. Meadows and Cathey hurled for Davidson. Kelly Woodham was the feature of the Davidson team’s hitting when he knocked a home run. Meadows started the game for the Wildcats, but lasted only one inning, Elon easily finding his deliveries and getting four runs. They got five safeties in the first inning, two of which were for three bags. Meadows was relieved by Cathey, who allowed but five hits for the remainder of the game. Briggs, the hurler for Elon, allowed the Wildcats but five hits during the game, and fanned ten Goodwin men. The box score is as follows:

’Cats Win First of Big Five Baseball Contests From State College

Nine Nose Out Wolfpack by One Run Thursday
EXTRA INNING PLAYED
Techmen Show Up Best at Bat, But Make Eight Errors to Wildcats Two

In the slugfest which was held last Thursday the Davidson baseball nine defeated the State Wolfpack by the score of 11 to 10 in a ten-inning contest. There were 31 base hits and 10 errors during the contest which resulted in the large score. The State men had the edge in the hitting, getting 16 bingles, five of which were triples. Although State showed up best at the bat, the Wildcats held fielding honors, making only two errors to State’s eight. State tied the score in the ninth by getting four runs off Wells, who was then relieved by Meadows. The Wildcats again took the lead in the tenth when they scored two runs as the result of two sacrifices and an error. State got one more in her half of the ninth when Meadows walked two men. Neither team had had a win in the big five conference until Davidson took this contest.

WILDCATS DOUBLE TEAM (Continued from page 1)

ner of Captain Price. This pair won the title in that year. John Roddey, playing his first year on the varsity, showed up well in the Chapel Hill tournament. The finals found Roddey playing Whisnant, of Duke, for the title. Whisnant had advanced to the finals by defeating his teammate and former title holder, Rogers, in straight sets, 6-3, 7-5. In the semifinals, Roddey played Elgin, of Carolina, and won 7-5, 6-2. The finals Friday afternoon showed some fast tennis playing but Roddey was defeated in straight sets, 6-2, 6-4, 6-3. McCutchen was out of the singles running in the second round, winning 4-6, 6-4, 7-5. The Davidson team, after completing the state tournament, left for a Northern trip. On this trip Cornell, Penn State, Colgate, and Bethlehem College were met. N. Y.: Whisnant, the singles winner, put Captain.

Fresh Players Lose to Strong Oak Ridge Team Netmen Unable to Co-operate in First Meet

On Friday, April 29, a tennis match was held here between Oak Ridge Institute and the Davidson Fresh teams. From the first, it was evident that the Freshmen were surpassed by their more skillful opponents, but nevertheless, from time to time, a good brand of tennis was exhibited despite the interference of a very strong wind. Each team was composed of four men, which meant that six matches were played, four singles and two doubles. Although it is customary to play the singles matches first, the visitors preferred to begin with the doubles, and this was done. King and Scott, of Oak Ridge, defeated Haverstadt and Johnston, 6-3, 7-9, 6-2. Johnston and Wellborn, of Oak Ridge, defeated DeCamp and Pettus by the score of 4-6, 7-5, 6-3. The results of the single matches are as follows: King, Oak Ridge, defeated Haverstadt, Davidson, 1-6, 8-6, 6-2. Scott, Oak Ridge, defeated Johnston, Davidson, 6-2, 7-5. DeCamp, Davidson, defeated Johnson, Oak Ridge, 2-6, 6-0, 6-2. Wellburn, Oak Ridge, defeated Pettus, Davidson, 6-0, 6-2. The chief trouble of the Freshman team seemed to be a lack of experience in match play. This was their first encounter, and, with the exception of DeCamp, all showed signs of nervousness and were slow in getting started. A return match has been planned to be played at Oak Ridge on Saturday of this week.

Baby Deacons Win Game From Fresh

The Wildkittens opened their road trip last week at Wake Forest, losing to the Baby Deacons by 7-2, on April 27. Hightower, Wake Forest twirler, allowed but four scattered hits, two of which were gathered in by Miller, Kitten center-fielder. ‘Doc’ Henderson took the mound for the Davidsonians and pitched a fairly good game. With better support, he would have come out much better. The Kittens made five miscues in the field, while the Deacons played errorless ball, and hit at opportune times. This game evened the series for the present year, the Kittens having previously defeated Wake Forest 6-3 at Davidson. The box score:

NEW STUDENTS’ STORE (Continued from page 1)

BULLETIN—Last minute news from the team states that Davidson won a 5-1 victory over the Cornell team, playing in Ithaca. It is located in the basement of one of the dormitories and known as the “Honor Store.” Later on, it was moved to its present location back of Dormitory Row and the name changed to the “Student Store.” Each year finds that new articles are placed on the shelves and that almost everything needed in everyday activity may be found there.

AB R H E Tar Heels Win One-Sided Encounter From Wildcats Westmoreland, Star Hurler, Pitches No-Hit Game

On April 29, Davidson met its second defeat at the hands of the Tar Heels by a score of 11 to 0. Westmoreland was master of the situation from the start, pitching a no-hit, no-run game. He was ably supported by his teammates, both in fielding and in hitting. The game was featured by the heavy hitting on the part of the Carolina sluggers. Hatley and Young knocked homers, men being on the bases each time. Sharpe, Burt, and Westmoreland touched our pitchers for three-sackers. Carolina gathered 11 hits off of the Wildcat moundsmen. No Davidson man reached first until the fifth inning, when one Wildcat player passed the first bag, and then was thrown out a moment later at second. Crawford’s hit over second was handled by Burt, who touched second, putting Duling out, and then throwing Crawford out at first. The following is the score of the game:
