### FOR A BETTER DAVIDSON

### Davidson Military Unit Receives Distinguished Rating for Second Time

**One of Six Schools in Corps Area to be Honored**

**RATED HIGHEST**

**Blue Stars Will be Worn on Blouse in Recognition of Distinguished Rating**

For the second consecutive year, the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps Unit of Davidson College has been given the distinguished rating
by the War Department. In 1926, Davidson first won the Distinguished rating with an efficiency percentage of 89.5 percent. This
year’s percentage was raised to 92.43 percent. This was the highest rating given to any school in the Fourth Corps
Area, which includes North and South Carolina, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida, and Tennessee. Of the 15 schools recommended for distinguished
rating, only six received it. They were: Citadel, Clemson, Davidson, Miss. A. & M., Auburn, and Florida.

Winning the highest efficiency percentage in competition with schools that are primarily military reflects much honor upon the Davidson unit
and its directors. The rating is made on a basis of 100 percent. The work is divided into several different
phases, all of which count a certain percent. Theoretical and practical work count a great deal. Other factors which have
contributed to the rating of the unit were the support of the faculty, the spirit of the student body, the
drill ground facilities, classroom equipment, and the support of The Davidsonian. The recognition of the distinguished rating is a blue
star which is worn on the sleeve of the blouse. These stars will not be issued until the blouse is
donned in bodily defense of the biting cold.

### New “Orientation Week” Program Benefits Rats

**Dr. Thompson Delivers Feature Address on “College Ideals”**

A new and very worthwhile feature of the college opening this year was “Orientation Week,” instituted for the benefit of
the new men. The need for such a program at Davidson has long been felt and it has already proved
to be of great value to freshmen and old men.

Freshmen were required to arrive in Davidson on Monday, September 5th, in order to unpack, straighten rooms, and become somewhat
acquainted with surroundings. Then on Tuesday, all were required to register before 5:00 p.m. The “Y” men were on hand,
meeting all trains and buses to give information and directions to the new men. Tuesday night at 7:30, all freshmen
were required to meet in Shearer Hall for the opening program of “Orientation Week.” Charles McRae, president of the “Y,”
conducted a short devotional exercise, which was followed by a short but appropriate address of welcome to the new men
by Hugh Arrowood, student body president. Introduced by Dean Williams, Dr. W. T. (“Tolly”) Thompson, Professor of Religious Education at
Union Theological Seminary, delivered a stirring address to the freshmen on “College Ideals.” His appeal to the new men was
for moral—

### New Students Are Entertained With Reception on Lawn

One of the most enjoyable social events of the year was the freshman reception last Monday evening at 8:00 o'clock,
at which the Y. M. C. A. was host to the Freshman and Senior classes and to the members of
the faculty with their wives. The reception was entirely informal and was given by the “Y” to better acquaint the
freshmen with their professors and fellow students and to let them really know the fellowship which pervades the Davidson campus.
That part of the campus which is near the “Y” was lighted by the soft glow of Japanese lanterns and
under the light, various members of the faculty, their wives, and the class acted as receiving groups to welcome and
introduce the freshmen. Much good feeling was displayed and the new boys were made to feel very much at home.
Punch was served throughout the evening and at an appropriate time, ice cream and cake were served under the direction
of Mrs. F. W. Hengeveld and Miss Kalista Hood, assisted by several attractive young ladies. During the hour of the
reception, freshmen from 20 states were brought together in a congenial way to be made to feel that Davidson offers
them a splendid heritage and that the college is a place where the fellowship, such as they enjoyed last evening,
exists all of the time.

### Senior Davidson Students Honored in Contest

Two Davidson men received honorable mention in the Briand Speech Contest for their translation of Premier Briand’s speech, which was
delivered in French on the occasion of the welcome to the German delegates to the League of Nations last November,
dispatches from the Washington headquarters disclosed. These men were M. T. Gilmour, of Wilmington, N. C., and C. J. Albright,
of Richmond, Va. In the Briand Speech Contest, seven prizes were offered for the best translations of Premier Briand’s speech.
Although neither of the Davidson men received a prize for their translation, they, with five other students in North Carolina
colleges, took seven honorable mentions. There were 42 honorable mentions, Massachusetts being first with nine and North Carolina second with
seven. It was stated that 2,576 students submitted papers, representing 1,654 institutions. Since only the best translations were sent to
the headquarters in Washington, it has been estimated that over 100,000 students took part in the contest. Each institution was
allowed to send not over six translations. The secretary of the commission in charge of the contest, in notifying Davidson
through Dr. Thomas W. Lingle, who had the men in his French class, stated, “You and Davidson College are certainly
to be congratulated on obtaining two places in the honorable mention list. For that matter, you will note that North
Carolina ‘shows up’ remarkably well.” The other five honorable mentions coming to North Carolina were all taken by women and
were divided among Flora Macdonald, N. C. C. W., and Catawba College, Flora Macdonald and N. C. C. W. getting
two each. The students thus signally honored were Miss Margaret Bell Balfour, of Salisbury, N.C., Catawba College; Miss Thelma Cromartie,
of Elizabethtown, Flora Macdonald College; Miss Julia White, of China—

### Football Prospects For 1927 Appear Bright as Harrison, Grey and Nisbett Compose Backfield

**LINE IS WEAK**

**Candidates Start Second Week of Drilling and Grinding With Tenacious Spirit**

Wilson, after a full week of football practice has been completed, the various North Carolina teams are summing up their
assets and liabilities in the line of material for the coming season with quite an array of results. The majority
of the schools in the Big Five seem to be looking forward to good seasons with the teams somewhat strengthened
over the ones last year. Coaches Monk Younger and Tex Tilson reported at the Wildcat lair, and being somewhat baffled
by the meager group of lettermen that returned for early practice, grimly shouldered their axes and started hewing out raw
material to fill the gaping caverns left by the championship team of last year. Having eight veterans back on the
field, shaping them up and working over a rather inconspicuous bunch of men who came up from last year’s freshman
team, the thin red line had as a nucleus only four men, they being three guards and an end, therefore
needing quite a bit of bolstering up before anything like—The famous line of a year ago could be competed with.
From early until late these boys are drilling and grinding with a tenacious spirit to hold the reputation which is
left upon them, and at the present time, they are gradually looking more promising as they become more accustomed to
the task that lies before them. (Continued on page 8)

McRae and Appleby Talk at “Y” Vesper Services
Enthusiastic Welcome Extended to New and Old Students

Last Sunday night the Davidson Y. M. C. A. held their first of the regular Sunday Vesper Services in Shearer
Hall, under the leadership of Dick Flynn. The meeting was opened by a song and prayer, after which the speakers
for the evening were introduced. The first speaker on the program was Charlie McRae, President of the Y. M. C.
A. He opened his talk with a few words of welcome to the old men, in returning, and to the
new men in their first contact with college life. Then he gave as the text of his message, “If thy
hand or foot offend thee, cast it from thee.” He brought out the fact that every man is confronted with
two inner mo- (Continued on page 5)

The loss of experienced men from the coaches started strenuous work on them.

Davidson Faculty Augmented by Ten

Davidson has, by some, been criticized for growing too large and thereby losing that personal touch in instruction for which
she has long been famous. This criticism, however, can no longer be made. According to a statement recently released by
Dr. Martin, we have this year only 14 students to each professor, adding 10 new professors to the faculty while
the student body was kept at approximately the same size. When the four professors on a leave of absence for
the year return, the ratio will be reduced to one professor to only 12 students.

Prof. J. C. Bailey, who taught Greek and Bible, is at Johns Hopkins studying Greek. Prof. I. A. Beatty, former
instructor in English, is studying Latin at the University of Columbia, in preparation for his new position as Latin professor.
Prof. J. H. Davis is continuing his work in biology at the University of Illinois. Prof. A. V. Goldiere is
further preparing himself in Spanish and French at Yale. Capt. George H. Weems completed his four years of service at
Davidson as Professor of Military Science and Tactics, and has been transferred to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Captain Weems has been
replaced by Lieut. J. A. Otto, who has just completed a course of instruction at Fort Benning, Georgia. The 10
professors added to the faculty are as follows: (Continued on page 5)

Daugherty Appoints Battalion Officers

Capt. R. B. Daugherty recently appointed the R. O. T. C. Battalion officers and non-commissioned officers. The new officers are
all prominent men on the campus and are active in many campus activities. There were 29 commissioned officers appointed, divided
as follows: One cadet major, seven cadet captains, eleven cadet first lieutenants, and ten second lieutenants. The battalion is divided
into six departments: Headquarters and Staff, the Band, Company A, Company B, Company C, and Company D. There were appointed
two cadet color sergeants, five cadet first sergeants, and thirty-seven cadet sergeants. The new officers took over their respective companies
and duties Wednesday at the morning drill period when the battalion was organized for the coming year. The following are
the officers and non-commissioned officers of the R. O. T. C. Battalion, Davidson College, for the year 1927-1928:

Headquarters and Staff—Arbuckle, H. B., Jr., cadet major; McNeely, J. C., cadet captain and adjutant; Akers, J. M., cadet captain
and personal adjutant; Brown, S. Y., cadet captain; Dumas, W. L., cadet color sergeant. Band—Garrison, P. J., cadet captain. (Continued

Six Hundred and Forty Students Registered for Ninety-Second Session
Eight Veterans Return as Capable Teachers
Over Four Hundred Applicants Refused Enrollment
PROSPECTS BRIGHT
Immediate Resumption of the Construction of Chambers is Promised for Near Future

For the ninety-second time in history, Davidson College opened her doors to students from all over the South last Thursday
morning, September 8th, when Dr. W. J. Martin, president of the college, extended a welcome to the upperclassmen on their
return for another year of work and to the new men who are just beginning their college careers. With some
640 odd students registered for the present time, prospects look bright for the most successful year in the history of
the college. The fact that twice as many applicants for enrollment were refused as were accepted speaks for a select
group of first-year men. With several additions to the faculty and indications pointing toward the immediate resumption of the construction
of Chambers building, the present session gives indications of a bright year.

The largest Senior class ever enrolled in this institution is the class of 1928, there being 127 who matriculated. This
class is larger by 30 members than any previous class. This is due to the fact that 260 men composed
the original class that entered Davidson in the fall of 1924. One great factor in assisting the freshmen in adapting
themselves to their new surroundings was the pre-opening program during orientation week in which officials of the college, ably assisted
by J. M. Appleby, gen- (Continued on page 2)

Three Seniors Elected to Publication Bureau
Martin, Lingle, and Hancock Will Compose Board

In the final election last Monday for the members of the Publication Board, Boyce Martin, W. L. Lingle, and D.
W. Hancock were elected to serve on the board during this year. The men nominated for the board were J.
G. Wharton, Caldwell Withers, W. L. Lingle, Boyce Martin, and D. W. Hancock. A first ballot was run in which
Lingle and Martin gained the majority of votes. A second ballot was necessary to decide between Hancock and Withers, and
it resulted in the election of Hancock.

The Publication Board is composed of three men, elected from the Senior class. The three major publications at Davidson, The
Davidsonian, the Chameleon, and the Quips and Cranks, nominate a number of men for this position and three from this
group are elected by the student body. Two members of the faculty meet with the board of advisors. Last year
Mr. F. L. Jackson and Prof. F. K. Fleagle were the faculty advisors, and they will probably continue to fill
this position during this year.

These men go into office immediately as the board which served last year, being composed of Seniors, ceased to be
official at the end of the year. The members of last year’s board were Harllee Branch, H. M. Austin, and
L. D. Wharton. (Continued on page 3)
