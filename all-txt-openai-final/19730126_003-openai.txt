**Science Facilities Seen As ‘Inadequate’**

According to Professor of Chemistry J. N. Burnett, there is a definite need for a modernization of facilities in the
Martin Science Building. He cited inadequate ventilation, lack of proper air conditioning, overloaded electrical wiring, faulty plumbing, and poorly organized
floor space as the primary problems. Vice President of Finance and Development C. David Cornell concurred. “It is obvious we
must do something to upgrade our chemistry facility,” he said.

Burnett said that the hoods for eliminating chemical fumes were worn out in all of the labs. He added that
in lab 114, the ventilating hood is about 30 years old. “In many cases the building isn't wired for the
modern equipment we have,” commented Burnett. For example, he said that the workshop recently had to rewire the plugs in
the labs because much of the modern equipment requires three-pronged plugs. This necessity and others have essentially created two systems
of wiring for the building which puts a heavy load on the circuits.

The plumbing system is faulty, especially in the organic labs. “The steam system is wrapped up in the heating system
and needs to be separated,” Burnett said. The organic labs use steam in many experiments, and since the heating and
steam systems are intertwined, the heat must be turned on to use the steam. In addition, only the two advanced
labs have hot water.

Poorly organized floor space has been a troublesome problem in the Martin Science Building, according to Burnett. He cited the
three freshman labs and the organic labs as examples. Currently, there is lab 1 on the first floor, one on
the second floor, and one in the basement. Burnett believes that those labs and the similarly organized organic labs would
be more efficient if clustered on one floor.

Two other problems in the Martin Science Building, according to Burnett, are the acoustics in the basement lecture room and
the general lighting. “We manage to get by with what we've got, but fluorescent lighting would make a tremendous difference.”

Employees to aid professors are also needed. This problem has been partially alleviated by Mrs. Esther Rice, who was hired
this year to serve as Laboratory Supplies Manager. She is in charge of the supply room, keeps the chemistry library
orderly, and also serves as a secretary to the professors at times. Burnett emphasized the need for more support staff.

**Chemistry Majors Explain Difficulties**

Chemistry facilities and equipment are in need of improvement, according to two senior Chemistry majors, Bruce Snyder and Paul Smith.
“I don't think the equipment and facilities in the chemistry department at Davidson would be adequate for research,” said Snyder.

Equipment problems arise mainly in connection with Extended Study projects. “My independent study project concerning ammonia was turned down because
the chemistry department did not have the equipment needed for my project,” said Smith. He pointed out that some of
the electro-chemical equipment was antiquated.as flame photometer, is in need of replacement because there are not adequate hood facilities —
the ventilation system is another complaint. Smith said that there is only one hood which makes the ventilation facilities inadequate.
Snyder mentioned that students have complained about this issue.

Recently, safety rules have been revised and made uniform. Snyder pointed out many fire extinguishers have not been checked. “We
have been real lucky that there have been no big fires in the labs,” said Snyder.

Another major complaint is the building itself. Snyder explained that Martin Science Building was constructed to match the library, and
that there is a lot of wasted space. One specific complaint is that the steam can’t be turned on in
the morning because the pipes knock and disturb lectures. Another problem is the lack of a controlled temperature room. Smith
says this room is needed to house instruments which require a regulated humidity and temperature to function properly. Other difficulties
center around the classrooms, one of which echoes and makes lecturing difficult, and one which has very bad lighting.

The repair facility for the chemistry equipment is located in Charlotte and has created some problems. Snyder pointed out that
a student must wait a while before broken equipment is repaired. Part of the trouble stems from the lack of
personnel to care for and maintain the equipment. Snyder suggested that one person could be hired to keep equipment in
all science areas running correctly.

At the present time, there are four seniors and four juniors working on extended studies projects in chemistry. Burnett estimated
that they use between $50 and $100 of supplies each. He expects the number of students working on such projects
to increase significantly next year and does not think that the budget will allow for this. There is no money
budgeted specifically for extended studies. “Chemistry is really an experimental science,” said Burnett. He added that because of this, the
department needs good facilities and funds to buy supplies.

When asked about the possibility of additional funds being allocated, Burnett commented, “We haven’t seen any concrete action.” Even though
he had been asked to keep all budget increases to four percent, the professor said that his proposed budget would
be significantly higher.

Burnett offered two possible solutions to the building dilemma. Either the old building could be renovated or a new one
could be constructed. The latter plan had been discussed last year with the administration and within the department, but was
not thought feasible. Renovation will cost between $400,000 and $500,000. Burnett emphasized that these figures and the entire idea of
remodeling are only his personal estimation of the situation.

Burnett has asked for several small improvements for next year. Among these are remodeling the lab furniture, especially in room
No. 28, remodeling the basement lecture hall, and making the lobby into a faculty office, a lab supply room, and
a small meeting room.
