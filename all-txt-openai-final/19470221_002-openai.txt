**The Liquor Question...**

Davidson College is in the awakening process after the lean war years. Many members of the student body as well as the administration are sitting in the grandstand and wondering just which way she will fall. One of the most pressing issues before our student body today, which, by the way, is being dodged by everyone, is that of drinking. The time has come when something should and must be said. I am not so foolish as to believe that my few lines in this paper will reform anyone. I already know what the reaction of the drinkers will be. They will undoubtedly scoff and laugh and say that I'm a “mish.” For them, there is nothing that I can do. To those members of our student body who, like myself, do not use alcohol, I have nothing to offer other than a word of commendation. To those fellows, however, who are at present in the middle of the road, and who are not sure of which path to follow, I address this article in the hope that it will be of some help.

Relatively speaking, Davidson is still one of the last monuments to dances and social functions where people have a better time than at other schools and do so without the aid of intoxicants. Anyone who says it can't be done is wrong. Our larger state institutions throughout the country evidently think that such a thing is impossible. Outside of the colleges, the whole country is on the wettest spree in her history. Where is it all leading? Well, it cracked the mighty Roman Empire, and it will just as certainly crack us if we as individuals do not do something about it.

I will again accomplish nothing if I merely turn this column into a wrangle on prohibition. There are many arguments on both sides of the question. One thing is certain, Prohibition will never stand so long as a majority of the people are not firmly behind it. Laws which do not arise from the people but which are imposed from above will never stand up. The answer then is to gain that majority. Not by over pious preaching, as some may think that I am doing here, but by setting an example for others. By showing the “middle of the road men” that normal, healthy, average citizens and not merely a handful of saints think that old John Barleycorn should be banished from our country and our world.

**Editorials**

**Swan Song...**

With the publication of 5 more issues of the Davidsonian, the Spring elections will have provided the student body with a new Editor-in-Chief and accordingly new men of the rising Junior class will step into the shoes of the managing editors now serving with the staff. Ordinarily the old editor hands over the reins to the editor-elect at that time, but much to the sorrow of yours truly, it has become necessary that I sign my final thirty at this advanced date.

When a man resigns from any post, he must have reasons for doing so, and it is only proper that I give an adequate explanation for this unusual action that I am taking: First of all, the person who has the honor of being elected to this position must be an individual who is long on gray matter and one who has discarded the theory that sleep is essential if one is to live. Your editor was able to adjust to sleeplessness, but on the first point he has found himself taking the count and the scholarship line has been difficult to hold.

Many past editors of the Davidsonian now hold positions of importance in the field of journalism. Not a few are with the large press associations, and in my opinion, a year with this publication offers more of value than ten courses in journalism. For me, however, the Davidsonian is and has been nothing more than a hobby with my goal in life set on medicine. The issue is simple and clear cut... a college newspaper editor or medical school. It is obvious that there can be but one choice.

By stating that the paper has been nothing more than a hobby, it is not my intention to infer that I have considered the position lightly, for on the contrary, I have worked at the job with the best of my ability and have attempted to publish a paper which would be of interest to the student body and the administration. The experience, on the whole, has been an enjoyable one, and it is certainly not my desire to drop out of the picture. This, like so many other things in our short lives, is a case of what we must do and not what we would like to do.

Even if it were not necessary that I devote my time to the volumes, it would be only just that I give my very loyal and competent Associate Editor, Jim Love, an opportunity to pilot the ship for these remaining editions. Love was elected editor of the paper back in 1944, but was called into service before his term expired. On returning to the campus this fall, he found me in his old position. With absolutely nothing to gain, he joined the staff and his assistance during the year has been invaluable. The paper could not have fallen into more capable hands and the student body is indeed fortunate that he is to be at the helm in the closing rounds.

To Clayton Scofield, Dave Richardson, and Bob Phillips go my sincerest thanks. It would be absolutely impossible to adequately express my appreciation for the fine jobs that they have turned in over the past six months. Volumes could be written on the Monday nights which they have given in order that this sheet might go to press.

With gratitude to the student body for the privilege of editing this publication, the hope that I have in some way left a small scratch of some value on the history book of Davidson College, and the knowledge that The Davidsonian rests in worthy capable hands, I sign my final column.

**Breezin’ With Bob**

BY BOB RIERSON

Picking up the loose ends... The time seems now to be ripe for the setting forth of results from the recently conducted poll of students' opinion concerning the relative merits of the semester and quarter systems of college administration. The consensus of opinion seems definitely to favor the latter which has already been adopted in so many of the nation’s educational institutions. All the points formerly set down in this corner seem to add to an overwhelming endorsement of the quarter system, and in truth, there seems to be very little objection that might be raised.

The students who objected to this system could raise no constructive criticism of it and could not at any rate show what advantage, if any, the semester system has. It would seem that actually the objectors were opposing only the idea of change which is in itself a trait inborn into the nature of human beings. I believe that a deliberative perusing of the subject could not help but show to anyone that the quarter system is without doubt the best. As much if not more can be learned under it than under the now outmoded semester plan. It now appears unavoidable that within five years all progressive institutions will have shifted over to this new plan, and since this definitely concerns our own school, we may ask along with the sign hanging at the entrance to a noted undertaking establishment in Charlotte, “Eventually, why not NOW?”

By this time all interested (and who isn't?) Wildcats must be aware of the conspicuous absence of a noted (or notorious) publication of the student body that this paper had reported to be coming out on Friday last. This is an excusable error, however, since the Davidsonian must be prepared five days ahead of time. But since a goodly number (upwards of 97.82%) of the students have wondered as to the reason for its non-appearance, I shall now undertake to inform them of the true facts of the case, as received from a very reliable source which is entirely neutral on the matter, knowing absolutely nothing about it.

It seems that the contents of said magazine were, to a great degree, deemed unadvisedly mature for the average Davidson brain which is still in its formative period. Accordingly, the Lily White League of Cornelius and Davidson, not to mention outlying extremities such as Beatty’s Ford and Mount Mourne,appointed a delegation to meet the train when it arrived with the contraband bundles of the magazine. These bundles were spirited away by the worthy delegation, composed entirely of elderly ladies, and have not been seen since, although this is not to say that they have not been sought. On the contrary, every Wildcat is now obsessed with the desire to get a copy by fair means or foul (the latter seeming to have more advocates) and greedily to consume its contents to the utmost satisfaction. Prices are being quoted in the local market as far exceeding all expectations. For some unknown reason, the demand for the magazine has risen directly with its non-availability. This all goes to prove the old theory concerning the banning of books, etc., and the consequent effects on human nature. But just in case someone wants to see it bad enough, contact Joe in the basement of Georgia and bring your bankroll with you. This Joe claims to have gotten to the train before the delegation did!

PHI DELTA THETA

Seen at the Queens College “Sweetheart Ball” over the weekend were Brothers McLean, Newell, Johnson, Miller, Robertson, Sutton, Long, and Turnipseed. All report extensive deals at the various sorority breakfasts following the brawl. Brother Tate was off to Morganton to listen to wedding bells and returned to D.C. Sunday. One of the belles found its way into the big blue and made the return jaunt with the dashing young gentleman. Brother Starnes toured to the old homestead in the land of the sky while Brothers Oglesby, Foote, and Montgomery were off to Charlotte and vicinity. Brother Cameron was off to Greensboro as usual with Brother Colson on another gigantic operation to Jacksonville. The chapter enjoyed a feed at the house following vespers on Sunday night. Brother Starnes entertained the chapter with his vocalizing and inimitable piano stylings.

KAPPA ALPHA

The ranks of Sigma chapter were strengthened this past week by the initiation of 25 pledges. Ten men were initiated Saturday afternoon with 15 reaching brother status Thursday night. The new knights are Bill Barron, Dick Glasgow, Charlie Mitchell, Chuck Kirby, Tim Payne, Bud Fowle, Jimmy Glenn, Jack King, Donald Watt, Doug Hicks, Jim Saxon, Bill Bird, Phil Cox, Bill and Jack Faucette, Dick Easly, Fred Pryor, Fred Schwaemle, Bill King, Joe Richards, Howard Biggers, Harry Bachman, Bill Whitner, Bill Currie, and John Lyles. After the ceremony Saturday afternoon, most of the Chapter boarded a bus for Charlotte where a real Southern meal was consumed at one of the city’s leading restaurants. Brother Bone and Gentleman Jim had to fight off amorous waitresses. Six new pledges have been warmly welcomed into the chapter. They are Houston Matthews, Harvey McConnell, George Howard, Randy Kabrick, Morris Hardy, and Bill Bason. Several of the brothers trotted out to Queens for their “Sweethearts Ball.” One prominent patron of said school has been dubbed “Heartaches.” At least he has one friend, Kurt Webster.

BETA THETA PI

Wooglin’s sons were scattered far and wide this weekend. Colleges visited include Queens, Salem, Duke, Randolph-Macon, etc. Brothers Lemmon and Vinson made their way up to Duke to see Lemmon’s “sister” and friend. McGehee made his usual visit to see Dot. Brother Yokum went all the way to Randolph-Macon just to see an “old family friend.” Hope it was a pleasant reunion. Brothers McConnell, Jim Gunn, Scarborough, and many others went to Salem, and from all reports, they had the situation well in hand. Dave comments that “Davey Jones Locker” is most excellent when the lights are out. Scarborough was reluctant to go up there, but he evidently made up with Fisher again as he had to be dragged back to the “scholastic” campus. Brother Schmidt, carrying on in ex-pledge brother Morton’s absence, squired “Inkie” to the Queen’s dance, later took her home the long way to Mooresville.

NEW BROTHERS!

Gunn, Turner, Grey, Gallent, Richardson, Peters, Robertson, Barr, Scruggs, McNair, Murphy, Gourley, Edwards, Shurley, and Groves.

SIGMA PHI EPSILON

“Zoot” Thomason, “Influence” Herndon, and “Flunkie” Myers attended the Brutal Ball at Salem over the weekend while “Uncle Dave” Blevins and L. Taylor took over at Queens. We hope Taylor’s date knows the difference between the rich man and the poor man by this time. Robinson and McLaughlin spent the evening of Saturday in Charlotte. The time on the phone trying to find the Western Union boy who delivered the Valentine (to see who it was from!). Jerry, it seems, spent the time learning History, or was he making it? “The Mighty Midget” (C. L. S.) was most impotent over the weekend but Lamar wildhaired to Charleston Thursday on business (?). The Sellars Brothers, with G. Boro associates, went homeward but the return trip was marred by the mighty arm. What’s all this about Scruggs about to settle on one? “Coach” Moore kept the party at Whit’s in Rock Hill jumping Saturday night. Hay and “Smilin’ Bo” ventured forth to Hickory again and despite “Fearless” Fred’s usual antics made it back in good shape. McLaughlin spent S.A.E.

Despite the fervent activity during the Midwinters dances, our brothers and pledges took no time to recuperate, and were quite busy last weekend. Brothers Taylor and Grimbell attended the S.A.E. convention in Spartanburg, and then joined Brother Carrow and Pledge Brother Bob Little at the Furman-Davidson game in Greenville. The Queens Formal Dance was attended by Brothers Rab McGeachy and “Texas Tom” Powell. Sunday, incidentally, found Tommy in one of his old haunts, Winston-Salem. Flash!!! Brother Codington ventured up to Hollins College to visit “Pudden” McKoy, leaving his roommate, Brother Engle, with nothing to do but to go to his hometown Charlotte and date a cute little lass by the name of Annabelle Brown. Brother Bob Gambrell and Pledge Brother Richardson ventured off the Davidson campus to tour South Carolina... to be more specific, Limestone College. It is rumored that they ran into a little trouble there, but considering the info that we have, it is better not to print anything about it until it has been confirmed.

PI KAPPA PHI

The Pi Kapps spread over the state this week as they attended the various dances given by our beautiful and charming neighbors. The honor for the week goes to Brother Bud Edwards, who was the only brother to attend that dance. Lucky boy! Brothers Warren Higginbotham and Thad Barringer made a middle-of-the-week trip to Duke—they said they were taking tests! Ha! Seen at the Queen’s dance were Brothers Schenck, John Walker, Walter Walker, Bill Lander, Berwyn Rush, and Bob Bumbarger. Brothers Sinclair, Sasser, and Johnson spent Saturday night slumming. No news is out yet concerning their orgy! The writer refuses to mention Brothers Cox and Dobson’s trip to Charlotte, due to the horrible details. They say it’s the truth. We all join in Brother Cline’s happiness over his Valentine Gifts—a 1947 Dodge—red, too! Watch out for Brother Tommy Bumbarger, Robert, or you'll be losing a real, live Valentine.

PHI GAMMA DELTA

Amorous Amos Ragan ambled down to Miami for a brief visit over last weekend, in what was probably the longest quick trip on record. Ragan himself admitted it was his biggest date of the season, and, when asked if he considered that he had used his head, stated: “Yes, and as I recall, it hurt my ears.” Sober Sam Maloney, disregarding continual admonition from the chapel rostrum to lay off that sort of thing, attended a large valentine function at Salem College. He was followed by some of the less notoriously dangerous brothers, among them George Patrick and Joe Vance. Brothers Nation Crowell, Frank Aldred, Peter Brown, and Charles Elyea threw discretion to the winds and were seen at the valentine dance presented by Queen’s Institute in Charlotte. Stated the Nation: “Well, it was unique.” Stated Brother Elyea: “Well, what the heck, it cost almost nothing. I am always an advocate of free love.” D.K. takes pleasure in welcoming all the alumni and visitors who are attending the Norris Pig Dinner to be held tomorrow night at 8:00 in the Hotel Mecklenburg.

Cinema Comments By Doug Swink

Last week I signed my “30,” but since writing that, incidents have arisen which have proved to me conclusively that it is best for a writer to have more outlets than one for his writings. So, twisting both editors’ arms (the Davidsonian’s office is getting as crowded as the capitol building in Atlanta) I once more take up my pen and scribble.

MONDAY AND TUESDAY FEBRUARY 24-25 “THE KILLERS”

Adapted from Ernest Hemingway’s thriller of the same name, this movie has the background to become a top-notch picture. In the beginning, the director has kept the terror-by-suggestion dialogue and scene where two assassins talk tough to some people in a lunchroom. They are planning on killing big Swede (Burt Lancaster) whose life does not seem worthwhile preserving after two misbehaviorists, Albert Dekker and Ana Gardner, get through with him. The story is unwound by an insurance investigator (Edmond O’Brien) whose job it is to investigate the Swede’s beneficiary, an Atlantic City chambermaid.

WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY FEBRUARY 26-27 “THE SECRET HEART”

A stepdaughter (June Allyson) is a character who has just stepped out of Freud and who continually sits at a piano playing Debussy and pensing on her father’s memory. Her mother (Claudette Colbert) works her fingers to the bone over big real estate deals trying to keep the family with an income. The mother’s second love-life (Walter Pidgeon) is somewhat thwarted by her daughter’s “unopportune” speeches and attempts at suicide. However, June falls in love and is thus put out of the way.

FRIDAY AND SATURDAY FEBRUARY 28-29 “UNDERCURRENT”

A gripping movie starring such performers as Katherine Hepburn, Robert Taylor, and Robert Mitchum. The plot concerns a daughter of a scientist who, having been swept off her feet by a rich airplane tycoon, marries him. Her newly acquired brother-in-law begins to interest her as everyone knows him except her, and she cannot find him anywhere. Taylor goes into hysterical fits whenever his name is mentioned, and before Katy knows it she is involved in a psychological mystery. Heartily recommended for good entertainment.
