THE DAVIDSONIAN, NOVEMBER 12, 1920.

EXCELLENT DEBATES FEATURE PHI SOCIETY MEETING
Small Crowd Present to Hear Marvelous Flow of Oratory.

Phi Society Program for November 13.
Subject for debate will be posted in the library.
Affirmative: J. M. Dunlap, A. F. Fricker, H. A. Hill.
Negative: D. W. Roberts, C. G. Brown, S. M. Query.
Extemporaneous: J. M. Gaston, Jr.
Declamation: J. B. McCallum.
Oration: C. K. Brown.

With a small but very attentive crowd, the Philanthropic Society had an excellent meeting in spite of the excitement of the afternoon's victory. After the usual preliminaries, W. K. McCain stated the query, Resolved: That the United States should establish an International University similar to that established by Cecil Rhodes in England. McCain gave a brief sketch of the life of Rhodes and his work. He argued that the United States should follow the example of Rhodes by establishing an International University in America. J. F. Clarke, in arguing against this query, suggested that the money to be invested in study should be invested in extensive travel in America. On the rebuttal, he came out with his critical point that the United States should improve the universities she already has. The decision was unanimously in favor of the negative.

T. A. Lacy stated the query for the extemporaneous debate as, Resolved: That the present absence regulations are too stringent. He attempted to prove his point by citing certain of the absence regulations and showing them ill-suited to college men. R. R. Deaver, for the negative, in a well-arranged speech, proved that the absence regulations suit the needs of college men very well. The decision was again unanimous for the negative. The critic’s report was detailed and critical. He even referred to one of the speakers putting too much weight on one of his rear legs. G. W. Lawson was received and assigned to the Junior Society. J. L. Knight and L. A. Wooten were received from the Junior Society into the Senior Society.

DR. WINFIELD SCOTT HALL SPEAKS TO STUDENTS
Dr. Winfield Scott Hall entertained the student body during assembly hour last Tuesday with a learned discourse upon temperance and the moral welfare of young men. He presented his subject in a most interesting way, choosing illustrations from life as he has known others to have experienced it. He clearly set forth the way to success for those who are apparently doomed to be victims of a dusty death. Dr. Hall has made a deep study of his subject both at home and abroad. He was for 23 years a member of The Medical Faculty of Northwestern University Medical School, at Chicago. He has recently resigned all forms of active medical teaching to take up a new role.nation-wide work in social reconstruction.

SIGMA UPSILON.
The Sigma Upsilon held its meeting Wednesday night in the Bachelor's Club hall. The second chapter of the continued novel being written by the Blue Pencils in rotation, was rendered in remarkable style by C. H. Long, who led the beautiful heroine through romance and adventure, from the Grand Canyon to Hawaii. C. J. Matthews next read an anonymous poem. The first part of a short story read by Joe Walker left the hearers in suspense and impatient for the next meeting, when the story will be finished. After a short business meeting, wherein it was decided to have an informal reception for Dr. J. Calvin Metcalf upon his arrival, the meeting was adjourned.

“Y” DEPUTATION WORK STARTS WITH CHARLOTTE
Dick and Roberts Make Talks to Queen City Boys.
Last Sunday afternoon Leonard Dick and Dave Roberts held an evangelistic service at the Boys’ Meeting of the Charlotte Y. M. C. A. Dick, speaking first, told of the importance of clean, pure, honest living, drawing illustrations from incidents that come up in athletics. Roberts then spoke of Jesus Christ as a man and as a friend and challenged the young men to cease their indifference on religious matters and to accept Christ whole-heartedly and form a vital personal friendship with Him. The party, including C. J. Matthews, John M. Dunlap, “Friend” Wilson, '20, and McDowell Richards, went down to Charlotte in a car Sunday afternoon. They took supper with friends after the service and returned to the campus that night. This is only one of a series of evangelistic deputations which the Y. M. C. A. is planning to carry out. Joe Walker and McDowell Richards are to speak to the Winston Y. M. C. A. Sunday, and more dates are being arranged with other towns. Later in the year the Y. M. C. A. plans to conduct regular evangelistic campaigns in some of the prep schools nearby.

Dr. J. Banner White, ‘10, is at Georgia School of Technology, and W. F. Milburn, ‘10, will give a series of lectures in that institution on Modern Business Methods. Thornton Whaling, President
