**Pep band shakes the floor with Wildcat spirit**

With basketball season still a few weeks away, many students already anxiously await the opening game against Lenoir-Rhyne on Nov
7. Everyone seems to be looking forward to hooting and hollering for their Wildcats, but a certain group of students
will support the team by riling those folks up even more. Davidson’s pep band is a motley crew of folks
who are passionate about getting people out of their seats.

“The band can be found at all of the men’s and women’s home games, although they will get to travel
if the teams advance to SoCon or NCAA tournaments,” says Director Ken Davis, who is also a full-time director of
the Mooresville High School Band. Most of the pep band members played in their high school bands, although there are
a few new members who are playing new instruments for the first time. Usually, the band doesn’t have too many
chances to play together at the beginning of the school year, but meets for a few rehearsals before the season
kicks off. Practicing has to be fun, though, because the band’s repertoire includes such fan favorites as “Wild Thing,” “Hey
Ya,” and “Born to Be Wild!”

Nick Jennison, ’11, joined the pep band at the activities fair. He played flute in his high school’s pep and
jazz bands and says that he is fond of the “good girl to guy ratio” that the flute section offers
him. When asked about the perks of being a member, Nick notes that “there are only two to four rehearsals,
then you get a free T-shirt and free pizza and tickets to any and every game. It’s so fun, and
I haven’t even done anything yet. That’s real fun.” Nick also says that he can’t wait until he gets to
learn how to play the Davidson Fight Song.

Another new member to the pep band is Cara Woodroof ’10, who plays the flute and the piccolo. She decided
to join this year because she has really enjoyed playing in a symphonic band in the past, and there’s something
special about “being a part of a group that is creating something for everyone to enjoy. I think that being
in the Davidson pep band should be a similar experience.” Through attending many sporting events last year, Woodroof believes that
music can have a powerful effect on the members of the crowd. “I think the music adds to the experience
of the basketball games. The game and the music combined draw the spectators together,” she said.

Although the band does not have formal officers, Lisa Klein ‘09 serves as a student coordinator, organizing meetings and helping
Davis with recruitment. Lisa picked up the trumpet in the fourth grade, and her favorite tune to play is “Hey
Baby” because of the large amount of crowd interaction it elicits. About 20 eager musicians attended the first informational meeting
earlier this year. This is one of the larger groups the band has seen in recent years, so the Davidson
community can expect some great music in upcoming games. The stands of Belk Arena will rock this year, and hopefully
all that positive energy will inspire both the fans and the basketball teams.

**Cozy 300 East serves up eclectic food**
By CAROLINEWoop Staff Writer

The next time you’re set on enjoying a fine meal, consider skipping the pressed white tablecloths and blinding silverware of
the usual steak and seafood restaurant and opting for something more unique instead. Whether you have a performance to attend,
a special occasion to celebrate, or antsy parents to entertain for the weekend, 300 East offers you some of the
most delicious food in Charlotte in a warm, fun, and inviting atmosphere.

The stylish Dilworth spot, tucked into a beautifully renovated house on East Boulevard, attracts quite a crowd; the scene is
perfect for people-watching, but don’t forget to make a reservation. The night of my visit, the host informed us that
our reservation must not have been written down, since there was no record of it, but that he would try
to seat us. He promptly disappeared. I was just beginning to get testy when one of my companions, ever the
optimist, suggested that perhaps the food was so good that patrons were willing to put up with unpleasantries like this.
I didn’t believe her. Thankfully, this was one of the only downs of the evening.

300 East is dark, homely, and loud. No one will look twice if you are wearing jeans or draped in
a slinky, sparkling black dress; someone else there is wearing what you are, no matter what it is, and as
a result, 300 East is a great place to go when you don’t want to be noticed. Ask to be
seated on the urban patio, perfect at night, or better yet, in a cozy wooden booth. The atmosphere is very
intimate.

When we finally glimpsed at the menu, I realized that my friend had been right. The daily specials alone would
have been enough to satisfy the most discriminating guest, and the curiously intriguing menu is simply spectacular. Regardless of your
taste, you should find something appealing. The appetizers, always the most tempting bunch, range from earthy homemade soups to sweet
potato ravioli to baked goat cheese with crusty baguette. Entrees are similarly eclectic; try the Ahi tuna burger, the flank
steak with pomegranate glaze, or the grouper with baked crab. Whatever you choose, there will doubtlessly be something just as
delightful to follow; I have also been warned that they have a new and mysterious fall dessert menu that may
warrant a second visit.

Don’t expect 300 East to be without a sliver of Southern flair; the ubiquitous mashed potato appears more than once,
and a splash of gravy or the occasional fried green tomato should come as no surprise. Still, the poor and
patient victims listening to me prattle on and on always ask the unavoidable question: “What type of restaurant is it?”
I must admit that I have no answer; I have no idea what kind of restaurant it is. Nouveau American?
Eclectic Southern?

Whether you have a performance to go to, a special occasion to celebrate, or antsy parents to entertain for a
weekend, 300 East will offer you some of the most delicious food in Charlotte in a warm, fun, and inviting
atmosphere.

Even if I understood all the implications of these strange and somewhat artificial terms, I would still fail to apply
them to 300 East; the cuisine is simply too diverse and surprising to be given a name. But if I
had my choice, I would call it delicious.
