Drama Head | MYTHICAL TEAM “LINES UP" AGAIN — Tells Plans For Course

George Brengel Outlines Subjects to Be Studied By Actors Group

Mr. George Brengel, former assistant program director of radio station WSOC, has announced the general topics of his newly organized
course in dramatics. This course is open to all students who have a definite interest in dramatics of any type,
whether it be in acting or in stage work.

At Mr. Brengel’s first talk, given last Monday night, October 21, in Phi Hall, he gave a definition of the
stage and the playing areas. He placed emphasis on area section, the ideal stage, and spoke at length on stage
movement. In the second lecture, held last Monday night, Mr. Brengel discussed the objective and subjective theories of acting, but
most of the talk concerned the tools of acting: (a) pantomime, (b) business, (c) speech, (d) gesture, (e) position, (f)
stage picture, etc.

In his third lecture, Mr. Brengel will discuss the use of acting tools demonstrated by class members. He will also
take up scene playing, pantomimes, and short plays.

Lectures Listed

Mr. Brengel has announced the subjects of his remaining lectures. These are as follows:

Fourth lecture—Stage direction; blocking out script, rehearsals, “plants,” scene rehearsals, production, tempo and mood, dress rehearsals, etc.

Fifth lecture—Stage organization; crews, division of responsibility, the stage manager, the playbook, performance conduct.

Sixth lecture—Stagecraft; this section will be coordinated with campus productions. It will include (a) scene design, (b) scene building, (c)
setting the stage, (d) stage lighting, (e) properties, (f) house organization, etc.

Seventh lecture—Dramatic interpretation; here again the work will be dependent on the needs, and in cooperation with campus productions.

Eighth lecture—Theatrical conventions and tradition; “do's” and “don'ts,” glossary of stage terms, etc.

Mr. Brengel stated that the actual continuity of material will depend to a great extent on the needs of the
students, but that the outlined topics will be followed as closely as possible. The talks are being held every Monday
night in Phi Hall, and all who are interested are urged to attend.

Pictured above is the scrappy team that won the state championship for their alma mater in 1910. This group reassembled
itself on Homecoming day. Light but spirited, this band met only two defeats during the season, neither of which occurred
in the state. Since their graduation, the individuals have separated to different parts of the country to assume their positions
in respective businesses and professions. Several members of the team, which is endeared to the athletic hills of Davidson, are
fathers of boys who at the present time are members of the football squad. Pictured with the group is Mrs.
Oren Moore, sponsor for the team. The members pictured above are, front row, left to right—F. M. Simmons, Charlotte, coach;
D. A. McQueen, Jacksonville, Fla.; Lunsford Richardson, New York City and Greensboro; Mrs. Oren Moore, Charlotte; J. Max Hendrix, Greensboro;
Rev. W. A. Nicholson, Pineville; R. L. Booe, Kennedy, Texas; W. M. Fastover, S.C.; W. D. Pollock, M. Phipps, Quay,
Florence; Eugene Alexander, Manchester, Ga.; S. Goodwin, Florence; Tim Pharr, Columbia; W. D. Gantt, Quay; Neal, Columbia.

Unlike U.S. marine opinion, majority sentiment among college students today holds that it is more important for the United States
to try to keep out of war than to help England even at the risk of becoming involved. Simultaneously over
the entire nation, Student Opinion Surveys of America has sent its interviewers to query all types of students on large
and small campuses, presenting to them a problem vital to American youth, a question many times discussed in a thousand
dormitory and boarding house bull sessions. With the co-operation of the Davidsonian and scores of other newspaper members, the Surveys
have gathered and tabulated these opinions by means of scientific sampling methods. Here are the results:

Students were asked which of the two following things they thought was more important for the United States to try
to do. Their answers, in percentages, are given after each statement:

Keep the U.S. out of war -------- 55 percent
Help England, even at the risk of getting into the war -------- 45 percent

This is what American college students think. A Gallup poll recently pointed out that 68 percent of the American public
believes the British are holding our first line of defense and helping them is more important than steering away from
war. Students, however, have repeatedly shown their tendency toward non-intervention.

Majority Sentiment

The next day the party went to Front Royal, Va. to inspect the American Viscose plant which is one of
the six that are located in the South. This plant covers 21 acres and when in full operation will employ
2,500 people. Friday afternoon the party went over the Skyline Drive to Luray, Va. and visited the Luray Caverns. The
tour ended when the party returned to Durham, where they were guests of Duke University for their Homecoming parade and
the Duke-Georgia Tech game. These goodwill and observation trips are annual affairs and have covered Alabama, Georgia, South and North
Carolina, and Virginia. They reveal that heavy industries are fast moving into these states with the result that the South
is becoming a region not only noted for its production of crude materials but also for its manufacturing capabilities.
