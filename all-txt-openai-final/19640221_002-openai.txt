THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

PAGE TWO FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 21, 1964

(Letters to the editor do not necessarily reflect the views of the editor.)

With Mixed Emotions

Disregarding for a moment the new faculty oath itself, we want to express a note of appreciation to the trustees,
in particular the Education Committee. For several months now, a number of trustees have put in a tremendous amount of
time and effort in studying and restudying the question of the faculty oath. The answer they came up with may
or may not ultimately prove to be in the best interests of Davidson College, but that answer must be recognized
as a sincere and honest effort on the part of the trustees to best serve those interests.

At the risk of being presumptuous, we intend to reserve detailed editorial comment on the potential repercussions of the new
oath until we have had a chance to give the matter more thorough consideration. We still oppose the idea of
a required faculty oath. However, if a verbal test of faculty loyalties must exist, the trustees have definitely taken a
positive step toward making the test more acceptable to prospective professors. The revamped oath represents more of a statement of
dedication, whereas the old one was, as Dr. Warner Hall termed it this week, a “theological witch hunt.”

Christmas In March

The Easter Gift Fund is off to a good start. More than 500 votes were cast in Tuesday’s election. If
this turnout is any indication of the interest of the student body in the Fund, the stated goal of 2,300
dollars should be met and exceeded. The Nevin’s Vocational School is a worthy recipient of this year’s Fund. Many of
the people with whom it works can be included in the 20 percent of Americans whom President Johnson recently classed
as poverty-stricken.

But beyond the mere fact of restricted income is the fact that many of these people of low intelligence feel
a deep sense of shame because of their condition. Unfortunately, the attitude still persists in many quarters that there is
something morally wrong with mental defectives. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that a significant number of people of low intelligence
develop other types of mental illness. One cannot live day after day with the belief that there is something “bad”
about him, and retain mental and emotional stability.

In a modern, complex society we often tend to measure the worth of a man in terms of the amount
or kind of work he does. The distinction between “white-collar” and “blue-collar” workers, for example, carries with it certain connotations
of social prestige, intelligence, background, and so on. And the man who does no work, regardless of whether this results
from a lack of motivation or a lack of ability, is usually regarded as a sort of parasite on society.
Small wonder, then, that the mental defective often feels ashamed that he is as he is.

It is precisely at this juncture that the work of the Nevin’s Vocational School takes on such importance. By training
people of low intelligence to perform some kind of simple skill, the school makes a positive contribution to the mental
and emotional, as well as financial, well-being of these people. It enables them to become useful and productive members of
the society in which they live. No doubt the great majority of Nevin’s graduates will never become expert craftsmen or
technicians. But in a life which is full of the darkness of despair and guilt, whether real or imagined, even
one small candle of hope represents a tremendous amount of light.

This is where we come in. Because of its limited sources of income, Nevin’s has been unable to expand as
Charlotte has grown. The 14,000 dollars it receives annually from service clubs is devoted entirely to the upkeep and operation
of existing facilities. The 2,300 dollar Gift Fund will cover, in full, the expenses of building and equipping the new
workshop which the school must have in order to meet the increasing needs of the Charlotte area. So often we
are aware of people around us who need our help, but we don’t know how to go about helping them.
This year’s Gift Fund is a vehicle through which we can help a great many people fashion useful and constructive
lives for themselves. Keep that in mind when the solicitor on your hall knocks on your door.

A Breath Of Fresh Air

After all the years of ineffective complaints about the Slater outfit's operation in the Student Union, at long last a
day of reckoning is apparently at hand. It is encouraging to see a public official—in this case Mr. Noah Walters,
a sanitation inspector for the state Board Of Health—with a real sense of devotion to his duties.

In our last editorial on the oath we pointed out (as had the faculty committee which studied the oath) the
inconsistency in allowing a man to teach here for an indefinite period of time without taking the oath, but requiring
it of candidates for full professorship. The trustees definitely solved the inconsistency, but what they came up with wasn’t exactly
what we had in mind. The oath will now be required of all professors wishing to establish tenure. Thus the
new oath is definitely a compromise—a less objectionable oath, but with wider application. Finally, if the oath must be, we
greatly applaud the trustee action in taking it out of the commencement ceremonies and putting it into a quiet religious
service. The new context will be far more conducive to a professor’s making a genuinely-felt statement of dedication to religious
ideals and vocation.

We were mildly astounded and extremely gratified to learn of the unanimous trustee vote of confidence given the administration concerning
controversial speakers. To say the least, we hope the action represents a trend in trustee attitude toward academic freedom in
general.

ADOPTED BY TRUSTEES

Statement Of Purpose

Ed. Note: The following statement of purpose was adopted by the Trustees of Davidson College Wednesday, Feb. 19.

1. Christian Commitment: Davidson College is an institution of higher learning established by the Presbyterians of North Carolina in 1837.
Since its founding, the ties which bind the college to the Presbyterian Church have remained close and strong. It is
the desire of all concerned that this vital relationship be continued in the future, to the mutual advantage of church
and school. The primary loyalty of the college extends beyond the bounds of denomination to the Christian Community as a
whole, through which medium it would seek to serve the world. Davidson recognizes God as the source of all truth.
As a college committed to the historic Christian faith, it sees Jesus Christ as the central fact of history, giving
purpose, order, and value to the whole of life. Davidson is dedicated to the quest for truth and would set
no limits to the adventures of the mind. Hence, it encourages teachers and students to explore the facts of the
universe through the free and rigorous use of their intellectual powers. Faith and reason must work together in mutual respect
if Davidson is to realize her vision of excellence in the field of Christian higher education.

2. The College: A Community of Learning

In implementing its purpose to promote higher learning, Davidson has chosen to be a college, to maintain itself as a
small community of learners, to emphasize the teaching responsibility of all professors, and to ensure the opportunity for personal relationships
between students and teachers. It is vital that all students, freshmen as well as upperclassmen, know and study under mature
and scholarly men who are able and eager to provide for each of them stimulus, instruction, and guidance. In meeting
its responsibilities, the college must constantly endeavor to provide adequate physical facilities, and to increase its financial resources; but more
important, it must seek men of the highest caliber for student body and faculty alike. The selection of students must
be based upon merit rather than upon economic status, social standing, or ethnic background. Davidson must always seek men of
character, of general as well as academic ability, of loyalty to the ideals of the college, and of promise for
future usefulness. In the selection of teachers, it must seek men of genuine spirituality who are outstanding intellectually, who have
the best training available in their fields of study, and whose interest in the students and in teachingis unfeigned and
profound. It must also provide these men with the time and opportunity for creative scholarship which is fundamental to the
best teaching.

### Education in the Liberal Arts

Davidson is a college of liberal arts. As such, it emphasizes those studies, disciplines, and activities which liberate men physically,
mentally, and spiritually. Although its curriculum prepares men adequately for graduate study, Davidson's primary purpose is to develop men of
humane and creative minds and of Christian character for full lives of leadership, service, and self-fulfillment. The college requires physical
education, provides for competitive athletics, and encourages varied social and cultural activities. It endeavors to teach students to think clearly
and accurately, to make relevant and valid judgments, to discriminate among values, and to communicate freely with others in the
realm of ideas. Since this can be significantly realized only on the basis of an appreciative knowledge of the past
and a working acquaintanceship with current theory, Davidson concentrates upon the study of history, literature, music and the arts, the
physical, natural and social sciences, languages, mathematics, philosophy, and religion.

Just as body and mind require exercise and nourishment for healthy growth, so does the spirit. Davidson maintains, therefore, that
a college must be a worshipping as well as a studying community, if it is to nurture the whole man
and if it is to be genuinely Christian. Hence, religious services and activities, as well as courses in religion, form
an integral part of its program.

Davidson College possesses a priceless heritage bequeathed by those who have given their lives and their possessions for its welfare.
To it has been much given, and of it much will be required. In gratitude for what has been accomplished,
but in humble recognition that it has not fully measured up to its own ideals either in learning or in
life, its trustees, its faculty, its students, and its friends must constantly rededicate themselves to their task. Only through ceaseless
effort and sacrificial labor can they make of Davidson what it seeks to be—a Christian liberal arts college second to
none in the service of God and of man.

### LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

#### Edwards Defends Atheist’s Challenge

Dear Editor:

It seems to me that a good many people are prone to make rather scathing observations on topics which are
completely out of their range of experience. Upon reading that their beloved Christian Davidson College had actually asked an atheist
to corrupt the young and feeble minds of its uninformed and immature students with his blasphemous doubletalk, scores of loyal
Christians immediately penned angry letters to the various news media of the area.

My knowledge of Christianity is rather limited, since I myself am one of these puerile students, yet I seem to
recall that Christianity is a faith which has withstood the ravages of immorality and atheism in various forms for almost
20 centuries. If a young Christian can provide no answers to the challenges of today, he is a poor supporter
of his cause. Dr. MacCormac supplied many of these answers and aroused concern toward filling in the missing plates in
the defensive armor of theism.

I don't propose to defend Dr. Scriven, but I most definitely defend his right to speak. For Rev. Long, who
calls Scriven an “amateur popinjay,” I will be willing to furnish both the coffee and the cups he requests in
order to hear his final blows to Scriven in such a short length of time. Maybe this could be arranged;
surely our immature campus can listen to a minister of the gospel defending his own faith.

Charles A. Edwards

#### Watson

Dear Editor:

If there were more men like Dr. Scriven, the arrogance and intellectual dishonesty of those who profess to know all
religious truth would happily disappear. Hearing this brilliant gentleman was one of those rare moments that make living in a
community dominated by status seekers, Rotarians, and the religiously orthodox tolerable. I should like to express my thanks to the
Davidson YMCA for inviting this outstanding scholar to your campus and allowing us ‘outsiders’ the opportunity to hear him.

#### Wiseman

Dear Editor:

Surely I am joined by the many other level-headed and clear-thinking realists who make up this college in my shock
at being confronted by such idealistic fantasy as was unleashed in the student sermon at the last Vespers service. After
the initial wave of indignation passes away, I wonder how an intelligent person, after several years under the sophisticated apron
of Mother Davidson, can dare express such unrealistic ideas. Surely Mr. Reese must realize that we must needs take arms
against our seas of troubles with more respectable hypotheses than the outgrown, child-comforting thoughts which were set forth.

With such omnipotent phrases in current acceptance and use by religious scholars as “ultimate concern” or “ground of our being,”
it is most difficult to understand why anyone dare employ such evangelical anarchisms as “love” or “Jesus.” Also, he must
take us for complete dupes to suggest such an outrageous maxim as “be honest with yourself,” let alone “be honest
with others” (advice which destroys the seven pillars of our foreign policy). Apart from the excessive and unwarranted use of
the words “Jesus” and “God,” perhaps the most disturbing aspect of the entire spasm of faith was the feeling that
he probably meant every old-fashioned word he said. Perhaps the Chaplain could call.

### Myers: ‘The Visit’ Tops Previous Vag Efforts

BY PETE MYERS
Davidsonian Drama Critic

Opening nights at plays are very exciting indeed, and last night was no exception. Friedrich Duerrenmatt’s “The Visit” was produced
with a finesse that has never been seen on this campus. The play, written for a cast of at least
35, in three acts and nearly twenty scenes, is an ambitious project even for a professional group. One is often
left wondering whether the Drama Department has been overambitious.

The story concerns the visit of the richest woman in the world to her childhood home, Gullen, Europe. Her visit
to this broken, poor town causes quite a stir, especially when she proposes to give the town one billion marks
in return for justice, with which she is obsessed. Louise Hampton plays Claire Zachanassian, the richest woman in the world;
her childhood sweetheart, Anton Schill, is played by Professor James Gross. Both do exceptionally well in these most demanding roles.
Both evidently have put much time and great effort into their parts, but still something is lacking.

Mrs. Hampton is nearly professional, but her opposite, Mr. Gross, cannot quite reach the same heights except in isolated scenes.
Mrs. Hampton misses the extreme vitality so necessary for her part. The character must be projected before she even speaks
a line. Mr. Gross is missing depth and technique, often resulting in monotony and loss of character, but doing an
excellent job in some of the most difficult scenes. One feels that stronger direction is needed to bring out the
best that is apparent in both these people.

The supporting roles: the Burgomaster (Will Terry); Bobby, the butler (Michael Frye); and the Teacher Muller (John Hall) are on
the whole good, but again something is missing. The butler looks the part, but does not sound it at all,
which completely destroys the good characterization that comes through when he is not giving a long speech. John Hall, the
Teacher, has an excellent role, but he obviously needs more experience to get the best out of it, for he
at times becomes too hysterical. In the more “comic” first act, the Burgomaster does very well, but the comic overtones
and the exaggerated emotionalism are at times too much, in the third act especially.

The bit parts, the townspeople and entourage, are too numerous to mention and criticize separately, but on the whole, the
group scenes run smoothly and very effectively and created a lasting impression. One was always aware of what seemed to
be unrealized potential.

Technically, the play is effective, for the most part. First to be mentioned here should be the superior performance of
the girls’ chorus and the brass band. Both did a commendable job. At the beginning, though, one thinks that the
introduction will never end so that the curtain can open. The lights and the sound effects needed much more practice.
Per se they were all right, but the presentation was rough, and many gross errors were made, in that cues
were missed and technical mistakes were readily apparent.

The colorful sets, designed by Preston Faggart, Andy Sale, and Mrs. Richard Trudell, were pseudo-avant-garde, insofar as they were of
the individual unit type. Due to the limitations in the size of Hodson Hall, the stage appeared cluttered and overcrowded.
This fault could conceivably have been overcome by varying vertical heights to give the illusion of depth. Needless to say,
the movements of the characters were severely restricted.

The Drama Department's production of “The Visit” is one of the best play productions ever to be seen, at least
in the last two years at Davidson. It is an adventuresome undertaking, but one senses a lack of cohesion, and
one is often given the feeling that the production just misses the boat. Perhaps this is due to a lack
of assertive direction. That it is well worth seeing is still beyond question.
