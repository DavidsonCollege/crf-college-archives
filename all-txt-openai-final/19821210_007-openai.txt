### Acquaintance Rape Seminar Held

**Awareness increases through informative talk**

The Women’s Concerns Committee sponsored a seminar on the problem of “date-rape” on November 30 at Warner Hall.

Speaking to a group of over 40 students, Jan Kenney, from the Victim Assistance Center in Charlotte, and Dr. John Wheeler, a counselor at Davidson College, probed this phenomenon which, Kenney says, “really does happen” at Davidson.

“Acquaintance rape,” said Kenney, “is not like rape by a stranger.” Because the victim knows her assailant, date rape generates problems different from those encountered in cases of stranger rape.

“Date rape, in a limited definition, is a sex act performed against the woman’s will,” Kenney said, “and will is a hard word to define.” Proving that the woman did not want to participate in the act presents another obstacle. According to Kenney, North Carolina sex assault laws changed in 1980, reducing what was called a sexual offense to an assault on a female in cases where the two parties know each other. “The chances of prosecuting a date rape are not very good,” Kenney said.

Wheeler examined possible motivations for committing date rape. “Men have bad trips laid on them about their sexuality. Communication problems such as confusion between a woman’s ‘yes’ and ‘no’ make it hard for a guy to know what to believe.”

The media, Wheeler says, gives no help in showing how male-female relationships should work. In many cases, television programs project the importance of machoism and assertiveness, programs which often justify violence at the same time.

Another possible motivation for date rape involves the high academic pressure in a college community. Such pressure creates great tension, said Wheeler, and men are taught that sex is a good way to release that tension. Kenney calls the result “stress sex,” the product of academic pressure, possible alcohol abuse, and a high sex drive with few acceptable outlets. “There are lots of prohibitions set up here [at Davidson],” Wheeler said.

According to Kenney, a woman’s recovery from date rape depends on the amount of support she receives. “The speed and quality of a woman’s recovery from a rape depend on the kind and amount of support she receives immediately after the rape happens.”

Talking about the rape is one of the most difficult things for a victim to do; feelings of guilt often come after a rape, and the possibility that the assailant might retaliate often stifles a victim’s desire to talk. However, if she can talk about it, a crucial part of recovery depends on the immediate support she receives. “More support systems are needed to help women in these situations,” said Kenney.

“Date rape is one of the most preventable forms of sexual assault,” Kenney said, “and also one of the most difficult to prevent. No external protection will help; a woman’s behavior is what prevents it.” One of Kenney’s strongest exhortations was, “Trust your gut. Women’s intuition will get you through.”

Kenney emphasized the importance of assertiveness in controlling what happens sexually on campus. “Women are trained to be gentle, kind, to ‘stroke [men’s] egos,’ and often they end up in tough situations,” Kenney said. “Women need to define their danger signals—their personal limits of feeling comfortable with a man—and they must assert their right to be left alone when those limits are reached.”

Disturbed by what she considers the naive attitudes expressed at the November 30 date rape seminar, a Davidson date rape victim volunteered to relate her experience to The Davidsonian.

“Things [like date rape] really do happen to people at Davidson College,” said Louise (not her real name), and that is a basic point she wants to emphasize.

For her, date rape began as a part of one of the big weekends of her freshman year. Her date was not technically a date, she said; she had spent time with him from the start of the school year, yet the relationship had remained platonic the entire time. Before going out that night, Louise found herself alone with him in Hobart Park. “We started kissing, but he was really drunk. I think he had been drinking all afternoon,” she said. Before long, he overpowered her, making it impossible for Louise to avert the rape. “Finally I kicked him and bit him enough to where he left me alone.” After the rape, she returned to her room, unsure if he even realized what he had done.

The next day, Louise says, “I knew I was trying to deny something, because I got drunk that afternoon to avoid thinking about it.” But when evening came and she faced a date with another man, she broke down, unable to see him. “My hall counselors pulled me through that weekend,” she says.

The Monday after the assault, Louise’s hall counselors sent her to the Davidson Counseling and Guidance Center, but, she says, “the quick support wasn’t there.” Instead of giving her comfort and reassurance, Louise says, “I felt like I was on trial.” She was shuffled from doctors to psychologists, yet she never felt she was supported or comforted by anyone other than her hall counselors. She missed a term of school as a result of the rape.

This experience has caused Louise great pain; for some time after the rape, seeing her assailant around campus petrified her. Today, however, she can handle seeing him on a day-to-day basis. “Now, two years later, I want to tie up all the loose ends,” she says. In recounting this experience, Louise emphasizes two basic beliefs: that the counseling center here failed to help her recover at all, and that date rape “does not just happen to bad girls.”
