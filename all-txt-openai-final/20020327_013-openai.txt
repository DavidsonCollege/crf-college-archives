**Leola pea Wildcat golfers struggle at Furman Intercollegiate**

**Davidson finishes 23rd out of 24 teams in weekend play**

Continuing their tune-up for the Southern Conference Championships next month, the Davidson College golf team fought to a twenty-third place
finish at the Furman Intercollegiate in Greenville, South Carolina this past weekend. The ’Cats faced another stacked field, taking on
ranked Virginia Tech and Ohio State. The Hokies won the event with a team score of 868, just four strokes
over par. Coastal Carolina and Furman tied for second place, both four strokes off the pace. Ohio State finished eighth.

Virginia Tech’s Brendon De Jonge shot a five-under par 211 to lead all finishers. Furman’s David Sligh and East Carolina’s
Jonathan Hill both finished one shot back. Furman’s Matt Davidson, brother of former Davidson golfer Sean Davidson and ranked in
the top 50 in the nation, fired a one-under par 215 to finish fourth.

Furman’s 6800-yard, par 72 track was unkind to the Wildcats. Jon Kropski fired a 77-75-77 to lead the ’Cats, tying
for 58th place overall. Junior Ben Friedell also shot well, carding a 76-81-74 for a 231 overall. Senior captain Dan
Carlson contributed a 239 and freshman Dan Walker chipped in with a 247.

Of the effort, Wildcat head coach Tim Straub said, “The team really struggled in the second round, which dug a
hole for ourselves. We rebounded the last day and will try to build on that round this weekend at Keith
Hills.” Straub continued, “We have to keep working hard and things will improve.”

Despite the recent struggles, Carlson is also looking ahead. “It’s frustrating that we haven’t been able to put it together
on the course in tournament play,” Carlson says, “but no one is interested in giving up. We are all dedicated
to making this a successful spring season. We hope to make some strides towards that goal this weekend at Campbell.
At the very least, the weekend at Furman provided us with an opportunity to become familiar with the course, which
is important, since the conference tournament will be held there next month.”

The Wildcats hope to improve at Campbell’s Lonnie D. Small Memorial at the Keith Hills Country Club in Buies Creek.
Next week’s tournament is one of just two more tune-ups for the all-important Conference Championships in late April.

**Harvard evens record at 5**

**Press Release**
**Sports Information**

The Davidson College women’s lacrosse dropped a 13-6 decision to the visiting Harvard Crimson Sunday afternoon at Richardson Stadium. The
Wildcats, who have lost their last four contests, are now 5-5 with the loss while Harvard improves its record to
2-1 on the season.

The Wildcats fell behind early, 2-0, but pulled within one on a goal by Loren Seaton 11:34 into the first
half action. Harvard went on to have five different players score five unanswered goals to close out the half and
take a 7-1 lead into the intermission. The second half proved to...be quite similar for the Wildcats. Davidson opened the
half on a goal by senior Sarah Thornton, but Harvard scored the next four goals to take a commanding 11-2
lead. The first two of those Crimson goals came off the stick of Melissa Christino. Senior Sarah Otto scored the
team’s third goal of the game with just under eight minutes to play, but the first of Casey Owens’ two
goals pushed the deficit back to nine, 12-3. The Wildcats managed to score two more goals on Harvard’s Heather Hussey,
who played in the cage the final 3:31 of the game. She made two saves while Laura Mancini, who started,
made eight saves. Davidson sophomore Becca Nussbaum made nine saves on the afternoon while freshman goalie Julie Goff made two
saves in just over three minutes of action.

The Davidson women’s lacrosse team suffered an 11-4 defeat to Richmond last Thursday afternoon at Crenshaw Field. The Spiders tallied
the first goal of the contest, a Polly Purcell strike, at the 10:15 mark and never looked back. Richmond went
up 2-0 three minutes later when Purcell picked up the loose ball and fed it to a driving Kristy Gallagher.
The Wildcats cut into the lead when Sarah Otto pulled UR goalkeeper Kelly Johnson out of the box to net
the visitors' first score. Richmond would then erupt from there. Spiders midfielder Jen Cielewich won the ensuing draw and passed
to Purcell, who took off down the field, flipping the ball to Libby Berlacher on the right side. Purcell would
net her second score of the afternoon, a beautiful finger roll off the stick to lift UR to a 4-1
lead less than five minutes before the break. Berlacher and Katie Dolan added two more scores before the half, as
did Davidson attacker Loren Seaton, as the home team registered a 6-2 advantage at the break.

The Wildcats pulled to within three (6-3) after Otto converted her second goal less than a minute into the second
half. Richmond would respond, again winning the ensuing draw. Berlacher drove the field, notching her first career hat trick. The
’Cats' Seaton added her second goal of the day for the visitors at the 25:30 mark, Davidson’s last score of
the day. Richmond would score the next four straight goals, with Purcell assisting on three of them and scoring the
other. Purcell found a streaking Alexis Brandolini (Berwyn, Pa.) at the 40:20 mark for an 8-4 lead. Richmond’s leading scorer
Carrie Aitken (Paxton, Mass.) netted her 16th and 17th goals of the year in the final 13 minutes to round
out the Spiders' scoring attack.

The Wildcats return to action Tuesday, March 26 in Blacksburg, Va., in a 4:00 contest against Virginia Tech. The next
Davidson home contest will be Wednesday, April 3, as they host Vanderbilt at 6 p.m.
