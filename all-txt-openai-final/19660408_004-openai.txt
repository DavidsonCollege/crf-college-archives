Netters Grab Three Wins On Spring Vacation Tour

Coach Harry Fogleman expressed satisfaction in a large portion of the ‘Cats’ play and was impressed mainly by their performance against Columbia. “We did a good job against a fine team in that one,” he noted. The trip was concluded on a sour note, as the netters went to a heartbreaking 5-4 defeat at the hands of Kalamazoo. The doubles games decided this one, with the third set of each doubles match played in near darkness. Fogleman termed it “a bad match, just one of those things.”

The ‘Cats only Florida loss came from a very strong Rollins team, 7-2. Only Pinky Hatcher could break through in the singles, Dick Hurd and Woody Faulk adding a win in the number three doubles. The first Florida win for the ‘Cats came earlier in a 7-2 triumph over a surprising Jacksonville squad. Although losing the number one singles, the ‘Cats roared away from their opponents to post a handy win. Fogleman commented, “Jacksonville was a much better team than I had thought they would be.” After beating Columbia, 7-2, the ‘Cats had little trouble in swamping Hope, 9-0, to close out a successful trip. Fogleman remarked, “I thought we played some of our best tennis of the season against Columbia. It was the kind of play that makes me quite hopeful of the season.” After a short break, the team returned home to open its Southern Conference season against East Carolina. Again, it was little contest, the ‘Cats winning, 9-0. The ‘Cats entertained Harvard yesterday and face The Citadel, another conference foe today in a match which Fogleman feels they should control. A greater threat lies in tomorrow's clash with Presbyterian, “a big tennis school loaded with scholarships.” Presbyterian crushed Amherst, whom the ‘Cats defeated, 5-4. Next week marks another obstacle the ‘Cats are trying to hurdle, when they take on Illinois on Wednesday and Toledo on Friday. Illinois, a strong contender in the Big Ten, boasts a powerful team. Toledo has practically everyone back from the good team they had last year.

Harrison Rowbottam of Boston, the chairman of the USLTA Junior Development Program, has been on the Davidson campus yesterday and today concerning the annual Southern Junior and Boys Championships, a USLTA tournament.

DAVIDSONIAN Issues Challenge

In a continuing effort to improve Davidson's sports program, THE DAVIDSONIAN hereby issues a challenge to the staffs of Quips and Cranks and The Miscellany to a croquet match on the front lawn of Chambers Building the Saturday of Spring Frolics. In his prepared statement Editor Louis Lesesne noted, “Seeing that this year's DAVIDSONIAN staff boasts of a number of all-around athletes and realizing that croquet is a gentleman's game, we issue this challenge to these lesser publications because we know we will dominate this gentleman's game, since neither of these other publications has ever been noted for their gentlemanly instincts.”

Freshman Spring Sports Launched

By JOEL KEYS
Davidsonian Sports Writer

Future athletic hopes for Davidson are growing as four freshman spring sports, baseball, track, tennis, and golf, are underway with emphasis on developing help for the varsity teams next year. The freshman baseball team has started slowly, with no victories and three defeats, but Coach Tom Stevens is undaunted and optimistic. The defeats, at the hands of West Mecklenburg, Lincolnton, and Garinger high schools were not nearly as crushing as past years’ losses. Stevens said that there are several good prospects for next year's varsity squad and emphasized the individual players. “We have a lot of experience this year which has been a great help to us. These boys have played a lot of ball before coming here. Usually, we end up doing too much teaching and don’t get to what we'd like to. Until this year there were not too many who had played Legion ball or ball in high school, but this year we have several with high school and prep school experience. I’m sure that fall practice has helped this year and will continue to help in the future.” Stevens spoke of several players who could be of assistance next year. “Bill Love and Macky Reavis are the only two players with a lot of pitching experience. Pitching will really be needed next year. Hank Strickland is a good possibility for a catching job. Ray Logan shows a lot of promise as a hitter.” Stevens said that Ronny Brown, Stew Brown, Hal Young, Tommy Poston, and Dave Fearnbach all have a chance in the infield, but the team is mainly defensive and lacks hitting. “We've had trouble with hitting because of lack of batting practice. Time and space limit us,” Stevens explained. The outfield is dominated by Frank Murphy, whose speed, range, and throwing arm were praised by Stevens. The next scheduled contest for the Wildkittens is against West Mecklenburg Wednesday on the Davidson diamond.

The freshman track team holds a perfect 1-0 record as it defeated its only opponents, North Mecklenburg High, before Spring Break. Coach Heath Whittle’s group will face their second contest tomorrow when they travel to Greenville, S. C., to compete in the News-Piedmont Relays. Schools from throughout the area will be competing as the Wildkittens will face other college freshman teams and teams from junior colleges. Whittle hopes to place high with Greg Cox participating in the 100-yard dash, the broad jump, the 880 relay, and the sprint-medley relay. Roane Cross will throw the discus and the shot. Bill Bryan will throw the discus and Wayne Huckel will throw the javelin. Mike Moats and Eddie Rice will run legs of both the 880 relay and the sprint-medley relay. Hopeful of doing well, Whittle said, “This should be a real interesting meet. Soon we'll meet Myers Park which has a terrific team.”

Linksters Lag In Fla. Tourney

The Wildcat golf team spent its spring vacation representing Davidson in the Florida Invitational Golf Tournament at Cape Coral, Fla. They placed 11th among 18 of the top teams in the South in the field. The University of Florida took top honors, but was closely followed by Louisiana State and Florida State. Medalist for the tournament was National Amateur Champion Bob Murphy of the University of Florida. Champion Murphy demonstrated just how tough the gusty Cape Coral course was by averaging two above the par 72. Of the six players Dr. Tom Scott chose to accompany him, Doug McKeever holed the low score for the four-round tourney with 315. He was followed by Joe Jelks with 321 and Champ Covington with 330. The ‘Cats next meet N. C. State Thursday at the Charlotte Country Club. Davidson has already beaten the Wolfpack earlier and will meet them on the fairways this second time sporting a 4-1 record.

Colonials Succumb, 7-1

The Wildcat baseball team suffered four losses in five games on its Florida tour during Spring Break. All was not in vain, however, since some of the players did manage to soak up some good rays. The baseball ‘Cats left Davidson following a doubleheader with VMI on Friday afternoon and arrived at Statesboro, Ga. at 1 p.m. Saturday afternoon. The ‘Cats took on Georgia Southern in the second game of a doubleheader for Southern, the first of which Southern had dropped to Wake Forest. Gene Bennett pitched the first six innings and was charged with the loss. Bennett’s pitching was not as bad as the 12-1 score would indicate, since several gross errors cost several runs. Charlie Elliott relieved Bennett and finished the game. Paul Brown was Davidson's only hitter.this year and they'll be our toughest competition until we meet Wake Forest.” Whittle had especially high praise for Cox, who scored 21½ points against North Mecklenburg. Cox won the 100-yard dash, the 220, the broad jump, the low hurdles, and ran in a relay.

TENNIS
The freshman tennis team has had two matches this year, being the victor in one match and the victim in another. Woodberry Forest defeated the Davidson netmen, but Belmont Abbey submitted to the Harry Fogleman-Jeff Frank-coached team. Steve Faulk, Judson McKellar, Al Varner, Dale Vash, Bruce Weidner, Frank Spence, Bert Cushman, and Kim Nelson give promise of continued success for Davidson tennis, as experience is a major factor this year. Fogleman said that the biggest match in the near future will be against the Westminster School of Atlanta. “They're real good, tennis-wise, and we'll be looking forward to that one.” That match is next Saturday.

GOLF
The freshman golf team lost its first match to Ashley High School of Gastonia. Dr. Tom Scott said that Carey Hite, Mike Spann, and Dave Moser have shown exceptional prowess. In their second match Wednesday, the freshmen linksters gained a measure of revenge by beating Ashley 17-10 at the Gastonia Municipal Golf Course. K. D. Weeks and Hite defeated their opponents 7-1 as Weeks shot a 73 and Hite fired a 71. Chip Clark also won his match, and Spann split. The success and failure of the team may depend on the number of participants. Thus far only six have tried out for the team, so the competition is not as rough as it should be. Dr. Scott urged other freshmen who are interested to try out for the team.

Sunday saw Bob the bus driver transport the ’Cats to the Putnam Hotel in Deland, Fla., the land of the “wrinkles.” Bussie Bob also provided a side trip to Daytona Beach in the chartered Trailways mansion on wheels.

ROMP STETSON
Monday afternoon, the team pushed its way through throngs of retired wrinkles seated on park benches, and finally arrived at Stetson's ballpark. Maybe because Stetson is Baptist, maybe because of the Daytona Beach trip, maybe because everyone was nice to the wrinkles, maybe because of a desire to impress the honeys in the stands, but undoubtedly for some good reason, the ‘Cats thoroughly demolished the Stetson Hatters. Buddy Durham started on the mound, and Charlie Elliott again relieved in the late innings. Durham received credit for the 11-4 win but true credit should go to Skip Angelo “Jet Stream” Waite who, when the ‘Cats had yet to score, lifted a pop-up into the strong gale blowing out toward left field and trotted around the bases with a two-run homer. Angelo was assisted at the plate by Bryant Hinnant who went 3 for 5 with a triple and 4 RBIs and by Claude Owens, whose two hits also included a triple. Sadly, the scheduled game for the next day was cancelled because of rain. The ‘Cats, reluctant to leave such a wonderful place as Hotel Putnam, hopped on the wonder bus and rode to Lakeland for two games with Florida Southern.

KING HOMERS
Howard Bryan pitched the first game, which was played under the lights in Henley Park, former spring home of the Detroit Tigers. David King’s three-run homer kept the ‘Cats ahead until the bottom of the seventh and eighth innings when a combination of luck, scratch hits, and Davidson errors enabled Florida Southern to pick up the decisive runs and win 5-3. Brown was again tough at the plate for the ‘Cats as he went 3 for 4. Thursday afternoon, the ‘Cats again came out on the short end to Florida Southern by a score of 11-4. Henry Wilmer was credited with the loss. King and Hinnant had two hits each for Davidson. Friday afternoon, the ‘Cats failed in their final test at St. Petersburg by a score of 8-5 to Florida Presbyterian. Jimmy Hyder collected two of Davidson's three hits. But for the ‘Cats, not all was dismal in the Sunshine State. The tornadoes did hold off until they left.
