### A Social Reflection

Davidson has had more than its share of earth-shaking controversies lately. Hopefully, most of them have subsided for the present. This provides an opportunity to stop and reflect on the state of social life at Davidson.

One could dispute the fact that Davidson’s social scene is lacking by comparing it with that of other small, church-oriented schools. Even some larger, state-run colleges and universities fall short of Davidson’s social activity. But just because these other schools may lack a desirable social atmosphere, it does not mean we have to. Visitors to some of the big weekends may not detect any social deficiency here, but almost all students do recognize that something is missing.

What is missing? What prevents Davidson from achieving the social excellence which is so necessary to complement the strong academic program if Davidson is to compete for a solid, well-rounded student body with schools like Duke?

Two obvious obstacles to a more active social calendar are Davidson’s size and isolation. Changing these aspects would be impossible, and undesirable, however. The advantages of a small, isolated college obviously appeal to the types of students who come here; otherwise, they would not be here. We can therefore regard these obstacles as unavoidable.

Although the workload at Davidson may be a bit excessive, it still allows time for extracurriculars, and is beyond reproach anyway. The problem with such a strong academic emphasis, however, is that it is oftentimes accompanied by an attitude that social activity should be restrained to prevent interference with studies. Quite to the contrary, heavy academic pressures require some sort of outlet for non-academic pursuits as a means of escape. Problems arise when there is an absence of proper means of release. Vandalism is a direct result of excess drinking which can result from nothing else to do. The college’s answer to such problems is often social restrictions which lead to further excesses.

Perhaps the most pervasive problem, however, arises from the controversial sex quota in admissions. It is impossible to attain a normal social atmosphere with such a gross misrepresentation of the real world. This is an instance where tradition is harmful and should not be a blockade to progress. Removing the sex quota alone would be a tremendous boost to campus morale and allow Davidson a stronger recruiting position.

There are also improvements which can be made by merely tightening the communication between the fraternities and eating houses. The number of dead weekends seems to increase each year. It is time to re-evaluate the virtues of such lavish expenditures of money and effort for such short periods of time.

In summary, there is definitely a social deficiency at Davidson. We either cannot or should not prevent some of the causes. Therefore, we must deal with those causes which we can do something about. The Trustees can help by dropping the sex quota in admissions; the administration can help by relaxing some of the restrictions (beer on the IMAC fields); and the students can work to coordinate their activities better. Davidson is an excellent place to gain an education. Let us make it a better place to live.

#### Honor System

To the Editor:

Davidson’s Honor System is new to me, as I am new to Davidson. I’ve recently transferred from Stanford University where the system is quite different. So before I lose the benefits of objectivity, I would like to make two statements about the Honor System as I see it; one of praise and the other of admonition.To begin with, I am very much impressed by the Honor System here. Its effectiveness is evident in the atmosphere of honesty and trust that prevails among the students and faculty in virtually every aspect of campus life. For instance, Davidson’s library operates on a basis of trust whereby students are honor-bound to check out the books they remove. Students are free to take self-scheduled exams in the absence of a proctor. And dorm residents habitually leave their rooms unlocked without fear of theft by their fellow students. Compare this situation with that at Stanford (or most other large schools) where at the library each book sack and pocketbook is inspected, exams are invariably supervised, and rooms are locked religiously for lack of trust. This is not an indictment of Stanford; instead, it is a glimpse at the way things are in the real world. Now in the light of such a comparison, the uniqueness of Davidson's system should be obvious. The Honor System works and it works because the people at Davidson make it work.

However, my faith in the Honor System has been somewhat shaken during my first few weeks here. Already, I have had several personal experiences with theft. On April 29, my watch was taken from Belk dorm; last Friday night, stereo equipment was stolen from my eating house (PAX) and from the Phi Delt house just around the corner. These events have diminished my faith in the capacity of the Honor System for preventing crime on campus. Why? Because they have forced me to realize that Davidson does not operate in a vacuum, that whether we like it or not, we are at best only partially isolated from the real world. This means that we must temper our idealism and face certain facts. Although the members of the college might co-exist in an atmosphere of mutual respect for the Honor System, there are others who do not share these values constantly coming onto the campus. Herein lies my warning: Davidson's Honor System must not be permitted to blind us to the harsh realities of the real world. We must not allow our idealism, and the apparent effectiveness of the Code in certain areas of campus life, to lull us into a false sense of security. The case of the stolen stereo equipment serves as a good example of the pitfall which we must be careful to avoid. The thieves were probably not Davidson students, but the theft occurred nonetheless. Furthermore, it was our trust in the system that led us to leave doors open, making the crooks’ job so much easier!

I hope that the Honor System will continue to be so. The atmosphere of honesty and trust that prevails among members of the college community is wonderful. But we must keep in mind the fact that “trust” at Davidson might well spell “foolishness” in the real world.
