Bernard van der Lande
The Davidsonian salutes

To Bernard van der Lande:

From the lovely campus in North Carolina
To Ireland, France, and Spain,
From California training to the
Wyoming wilderness,
A year in India, and finally China.
Your experiences have been many and varied.
Your education has been broad and rich.
You have accepted and surmounted
many challenges,

Giving much to others in the process.
Your base at Davidson, and professors there
have given you
Much richness which will feed you
for many years.

Now go with confidence and live your life!
