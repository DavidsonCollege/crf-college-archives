### Forty Dollar Patterson Court Fee No Solution
**Mark Halton and Rob Fields**

“I wish to inform my eating house/fraternity of my intention to eat there all three terms this year...and if I terminate membership after fall or winter term, I shall be fined $40.” Signed, Trapped.

Sound familiar? The Patterson Court Council (PCC) last week distributed such a form to all members of eating houses and fraternities with the instructions, “You must sign.”

What is the purpose of this contract? Those who eat on Patterson Court were told that everyone had to sign it in order to continue eating there. When we pursued the reasons behind this mandatory contract, we met with conflicting stories. We learned that no one at our houses had ever seen the official statement concerning the purpose and implementation of the $40 Penalty System.

One member reasoned that the contract was designed to maintain economic stability at the houses, but this seemed a little silly considering the length of waiting lists at most houses. Another useless argument in support of the Penalty System was “we signed last year, so we should sign again this year.” These arguments, however, were not reason enough for anyone to sign their name to a seemingly worthless contract.

After scrutinizing the official PCC proposal and the minutes of the meeting when it was passed, we discovered that the PCC and the eating houses and fraternities have not adhered to the system set down in this statement, and also probably do not know the original intent of the statement.

The system was designed to take effect in the spring term of each year. “During that term a statement of intent to join a specified house in the fall of the next year would be required by the house of all its members who wished to guarantee a place for themselves in the house during the following year (this would include rising sophomores who had self-selected the house).” The key word is guarantee in this statement, because anyone not wishing to sign the contract could wait until the following year and join a house that was not full. In this way, someone who wanted to eat at various houses in order to be with different friends could do so. No one is forced to sign a contract of intent in order to eat on Patterson Court.

The system was also designed so that any rising sophomore who would be eating at his second or third choice house would not be required to pay the $40 fine if he left after the fall term. The system, however, does not make any provisions for students on waiting lists. Contrary to the understanding of many students, someone who finds a replacement for himself is not automatically released from the $40 penalty. Of course, any student can ask the PCC to make an exception in the case that he does have a replacement. The Council, however, does not have to grant this exception and an individual house cannot make such an exception without PCC approval.

This system was instituted in response to five goals of the PCC:
1. To help stabilize membership by encouraging members to think of boarding on a year-to-year basis;
2. To shift the responsibility of a house’s financial stability to the members as individuals;
3. To require a member who “drops out” at mid-year to share the financial hardship his action is imposing on the house;
4. To encourage members to remain in the house through Spring term; and
5. To encourage in the members a more business-like attitude toward house management.

These five areas were supposed to be resolved by the $40 penalty, but they obviously have not been. Membership has not been stabilized. Some houses have large waiting lists, while others serve only as holding points for academics waiting for places to open in more desirable houses. The financial responsibilities have not shifted to “the members of the houses as individuals.” Rather, this responsibility has been assumed by the PCC. It has demonstrated a willingness to impose regulations in order to solve the problems of the Court. Individual members have no say and no responsibility. The attitude toward the houses is no more business-like than before—if anything, the attitude of students is less business-like. The attitude has been “just sign the thing; it is really not that important.”

True, the penalty system does force Court Members to bear some of the financial burden caused by their leaving a house mid-year. It also forces members of the Court to bear a financial burden even if none exists, namely in the case of houses with waiting lists. And, true as well, the system encourages members to remain in a house through spring term. Of course, it also discourages many from joining houses in the first place—especially seniors who would normally provide the experience necessary to keep a house.Stable. The system as originally conceived and voted upon by the PCC has never really existed. Hasty formulation, inadequate communication, misunderstandings, and misapplication have plagued it from the start. However, we do not want to admonish without offering some suggestions and insights that might help stimulate discussion among members of the Court. The PCC, of course, could simply do away with the $40 penalty and allow business to continue as usual. This action, however, would not address the problems of the court; it would simply abate the outcry. Alternatively, the PCC could direct the responsibility for action back to each individual house. They could still play a role in assisting the houses by identifying common problems and by serving as a vehicle for discussion among them. Individual houses could promote more stability by incorporating a supply and demand system into their operations. In other words, as the demand for house membership increases, the price charged for membership will also increase, and as the demand falls, so will the price, thus attracting new members. Students could be encouraged to plan on a longer-term basis by paying board bills the same way they pay tuition. Students who leave a house at the end of a term would simply receive a refund for the unused portion of their bill. The initiative, however, would have to be there.

We do not, however, have a monopoly on solutions to the Court’s problems. PCC needs to hear ideas and be willing to discuss them in open meetings among Court members. The problems which face the court will not be solved by any “quick-fix” system. We, the members of Patterson Court, should shoulder the responsibility for maintaining it as a viable alternative to Slater and the new Commons. We urge the present members of the PCC to straighten out the mess they have inherited.

More Campus Forum Athletics Are Neat

To the Editor:

How about those mohawks, strutting around campus proud of their intense dedication to their team and school. As many Davidson folk would say, “What studs!” We are so happy to see that school spirit and support for athletics is back on the rise at the Big D. Hopefully, it is here to stay. We are especially pleased to see this after the frustration many athletes, coaches, and athletic staff felt last year with lack of support and endless complaints that were continually expressed in The Davidsonian (seen as “the rag sheet” by many). Sure, problems exist within the program and not everyone is satisfied, but how can the athletes and coaches (who are very dedicated to their sport and to representing their college) do a good job when the very core of the school, both students and faculty, will not support them?

Participation in athletics and intramurals is an integral part of the Davidson experience, yet many people fail to see this. If we would all go back to the Statement of Purpose to which we were asked to respond before being accepted at Davidson, we would see that athletics is a very special part of life here at Davidson and great emphasis is placed on the well-rounded individual, and on fulfilling our potentials intellectually, spiritually, and physically. We recognize the fact that some people think college should be a totally intellectual experience, and Davidson will certainly provide one with a fine education. However, it does not seem fair to criticize and look down at athletes—labeling them football jocks or doing surveys to ascertain what GPAs we are producing (was a survey ever done on the number of campus leaders found on the various sports teams?). Furthermore, we complain of conformity on this campus, but it appears to us that it is the athletes, in particular the football players, who bring in much of the diversity, and who have a greater tendency to break away from the traditional lifestyle pattern of the Davidson student.

We have attracted many blacks through the hard work of our football and basketball coaches, as well as Northerners, many of whom have heard of the school through our basketball program. And, if we’re looking for excitement and a break from routine, we're sure that Pat Sheridan and the rest of Duke dorm will provide it for us. Lastly, just as a bonfire can be a unifying force on a college campus, a football, basketball, soccer, or hockey game lifts the spirit of the college community as we gather together to support or represent Davidson College. We all agree that athletics is a very important part of the Davidson experience, and we are thankful that we have had the opportunity to play and learn through our participation on teams. It is our hope that this will continue long into the future.

(P.S. To you students who’ve never met Buddy, Elmer, John Bird, and the rest of that crew: take a jog at least as far as the gym—you don’t know what you’re missing!)
