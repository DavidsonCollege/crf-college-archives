### Fraternity rivalries gone awry

So first there was the Shootout at the O.K. Corral in October of 1881 with the Earp brothers.

Then Kennedy stared eyeball to eyeball with the entire Russian military in 1962 in the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Most recently there was the standoff between Kappa Alpha and Phi Delta Theta on Self Selection Night, January 15, 1999.

It was one of the most eventful twenty minutes in the history of DC.

About one hour before the first bare bottoms streaked through Warner Hall, and two hours before those same bare bottoms
were covered and moving on the dance floor, freshmen pledges from rivaling fraternities KA and Phi Delt stared each other
down on opposite ends of the F apartment building. Some said the chanting was so loud that they heard it
walking into the Belk dormitory. Wyatt Earp would have been proud. Officer Stan Moore (Hightower) even pulled up to the
scene to prevent any unnecessary violence. It pitted the stereotypical Phi Delts against the stereotypical KA’s. Witnesses said the Phi
Delt pledges started the ruckus, aligning themselves in a row on the south side of F Apartment’s third floor. They
chanted in slow, inebriate harmony, “K-A Sucks! K-A Sucks! K-A Sucks! K-A Sucks! K-A Sucks!”

They laughed and smiled at their clever three-beat insult.

The Kappa Alpha members, stunned by this attack on their brotherhood, took a moment to register the offense that had
been thrown upon them. Suddenly, though, they realigned, as an unnamed and lone voice chanted from the KA side, “Phi
Delt Sucks! Yeah!” Others chimed in, slowly bringing themselves to harmony, “Phi Delt Sucks! Phi Delt Sucks! Phi Delt Sucks!”
Each of the KA members turned to their right and gave the person in front of them a slap on
the back, for their quick-witted retort. They smiled, tucked in their flannel shirts, and waited for Phi Delt’s response.

Tension was mounting, and the Phi Delts were now seriously worried about their house pride. They needed to preserve their
dignity. After a few moments of brainstorming, the Phi pledges came up with an exciting retort. “We’re not K-A! We’re
not K-A! We’re not K-A!” Shocked and thrown a curveball by the use of the reverse negative, the Kappa Alpha
pledges needed to think quickly of a response. They finally constructed a clever insult that topped all of Phi Delt’s.
They chanted, “Meatheads! Meatheads! Meatheads!” And with their final chant, they turned around in synchronous fashion and dropped their pants.

It appeared that the KA’s had gotten the best of the Phi Delts. The Phi Delts took it in good
humor though, adjusted their neck muscles and watched the KA’s run. It was all in good taste and both parties
laughed about it the next day. The event exhibited good old-fashioned fraternity rivalry and nothing more came of it.

While some fraternity humor can be fun and games, other types are less unduly favorable. Destructive pranks and altercations between
fraternities have become quite common in the last month with the induction of new freshmen. Ignoring physical confrontations, just this
week, Phi Delt found their stolen framed composite picture in the Sig Ep fraternity, whose brothers claimed KA had taken
it and placed it there. Wednesday afternoon, SAE reported that their symbolic lion had been stolen, and falsely accused KA
of having taken it. Several SAE brothers snuck into the KA house and wrote everywhere the SAE letters in honey.
SAE also stole the eight ball from their pool table and broke the house telephone. While all of this occurred,
they let escape an injured and abandoned hunting dog that KA had housed for the night.

The whereabouts of the SAE lion are still unknown. Some believe that in hiding the lion, the bandits placed it
somewhere where no one would ever go.

Like a Phi Delt study session.
A Sig Ep weightlifting contest.
Or a KA fraternity party.

Rivalries can be fun and humorous. Good fraternity rivalry is just that. And poking fun is a favorite past-time of
many. But when those rivalries turn to physical destruction or taking of another’s property, it stops being fun anymore. Some
pranks can be clever, others can easily be stood prank is only a step away from an unnecessary argument, and
an unnecessary altercation.

### What is the Stapleton/Davidson Internship?

What do you think of when you see the words inner city? Immediate connotations suggest images of poverty, homelessness, drugs,
and broken families. Charlotte, though only twenty short miles from the proverbial Davidson bubble, has its share of urban problems.
In the midst of all this mayhem lies an opportunity for you.

Through the generous gift of one Davidson College trustee, four students can experience what it truly means to “make a
difference”. The Stapleton/Davidson Internship allows students to interact in the intersection of faith and service to others. Last summer, four
interns (Debbi Covington, Anna Judy, and Grace Robinson) held positions with seven service agencies. Jobs included hands-on work with children,
youth, and the elderly and also administrative social work. Another component to the internship is direct involvement in the life
of Charlotte area churches. Each intern receives a $3000 stipend. If you want to put your compassion in action, you
will gain insight into the workings of a city’s urban outreach network. It is a rare opportunity to be able
to spend your summer doing such meaningful work and receive this kind of monetary compensation.

If you are interested, applicants should submit the following by February 5: (1) a resume, (2) two to three pages
on which you state why you wish to be considered for this internship and what you hope to accomplish if
selected, and (3) a list of work-related abilities. Direct questions to Rob Spach at x2420.
