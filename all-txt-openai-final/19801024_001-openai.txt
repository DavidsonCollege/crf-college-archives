**WDSR still in midst of organizing**

WDSR, the new student carrier current radio station, will begin broadcasting sometime before Thanksgiving, according to station spokesman John Odell.

The station has been slow getting on the air because of problems with equipment and organization. Odell said at the beginning of the term (Davidsonian, Sept. 19) that the station would be broadcasting by October. One problem has been the age of some of WDSR’s equipment. Much of it uses old-fashioned radio tubes, Odell said. Many worn tubes have recently failed. Odell said the station has been able to buy replacement tubes, which are fairly cheap.

Another problem has been finding disc jockeys. Over 30 students signed up to work for the station, Odell said. These students were then asked to fill out schedules so the station could allocate shifts. Fewer than 15 have returned their (See WDSR, page 2)

**PIRG nets enough to live another year**

The Davidson chapter of NC-PIRG (North Carolina Public Interest Research Group) is not in danger of folding, according to PIRG member Geoff Little. The NC-PIRG state board decided in a recent executive meeting to allow the chapter to continue, Little said. Earlier this summer, the board considered discontinuing the Davidson chapter because of a sharp drop in funds the chapter collected last year.

This year, Davidson PIRG collected $520, considered sufficient by the board for its continuation. The drop last year was the result of a change in billing procedures. Prior to the 1979-80 school year, a four dollar contribution to PIRG was included in every student’s comprehensive fee. Last fall, College President Samuel Spencer decided to switch to a positive check-off system, requiring students to add $4 to their bills if they wished to support PIRG. A student referendum last October supported Spencer’s decision.

As a result of the positive check-off system, PIRG collected only $200 last year, as opposed to $4000 in the previous year. $200 was not sufficient to meet Davidson's obligation as a PIRG member. The seven member schools of NC-PIRG, Davidson, Elon, Duke, UNC-Greensboro, Wake Forest, St. Andrews, and Guilford, each keep $200 and ten percent of all their annual funds. The rest is sent to the state organization to pay the salaries of the four full-time staff members and to contribute to a central fund from which all member chapters can withdraw money for extra expenses. The staff collects data for PIRG publications and advises member chapters in their work with environmental and government agencies.

This year, however, Davidson PIRG collected $520, Little said, which is more than enough to keep PIRG alive for at least one more year. About half of this money will go to the state staff. Davidson PIRG’s main problem is lack of interest among the student body, Little said. It is currently comprised of twelve to fifteen students. At the moment there is no chairperson. This year they plan to elect a four-member board. (See PIRG, page 2)

**EPC proposes new, more specific core curriculum**

By ELIZABETH KISS

Next year’s freshman class will have to follow a more specific core curriculum, if the faculty approves proposals released Tuesday by the Educational Policy Committee (EPC). The committee’s major recommendations include requirements that students show mathematics proficiency; and pass one course each in economics, philosophy, and non-Western studies, and four terms of a foreign language.

Discussion of the proposal will begin in a faculty hearing next Monday at four. Students may raise questions at an open meeting next Wednesday at 10 in Perkins Auditorium. In order for the new core curriculum to affect the class of 1985, the faculty must approve the proposals and make all necessary course changes by February, according to EPC Chairperson and Academic Vice President Price Zimmermann. The deadline falls in February because all submissions to the catalog must be in by that time. Any new requirements must appear in the catalog.

The EPC report calls for a two-part core curriculum consisting of a set of competency requirements in composition, mathematics, and foreign...language, and a set of distribution requirements. (see excerpts of page 5) The math competency would require students to pass a mathematics class or a proficiency test. Currently, students may graduate without taking any mathematics courses. The foreign language competency would require students to complete four terms of a language instead of three. The fourth term would have to be taken at Davidson; students could be exempt from the first three terms on the basis of a proficiency test. EPC student members Elizabeth Medlin and Bill Purcell submitted an appendix to the report opposing the addition of the fourth term. The composition competency requirement would remain the same.

The proposed distribution requirements specify that students must take basic courses in each of five areas. Only courses which are "broad, systematic introductions to assumptions, methods, and subject matters of the particular discipline" will fulfill the requirement. In some departments, students may now take any course, including specialized upper-level courses, to fulfill an area requirement. A course which satisfies the proposed distribution requirements "doesn't have to be a 101 course," Medlin said. For example, Purcell pointed out, astronomy would fulfill a science requirement because it introduces the student to many of the basic aspects of physics. If the faculty approves the proposals, the EPC will confer with departments to decide which courses fulfill the distribution requirements. While many existing courses "will suffice," according to the committee report, "it will be necessary in other cases to revise existing courses or to introduce new ones."

The proposed distribution requirements require a philosophy and an economics course and one course in a new area, Non-Western Studies. In Area I (Literature and the Fine Arts), students would have to pass one course in the fine arts and one in English or American literature. Currently, students must take three courses in Area I, but can use composition as well as literature (See EPC, page 2).

Faculty questions plans for new computer center

By MARVIN OVERBY

Davidson’s planned computer center may have the official support of the faculty, administration, and Trustees, but some faculty members question how well-grounded this support is. Several professors in departments outside mathematics and science said the faculty approved the computer program in ignorance. Missing information included:

—there was no official estimate of the cost of the computer system:
A News Analysis
—there was no estimate of the amount of the National Science Foundation (NSF) grant the College is seeking to underwrite some of the computer program’s costs;
—few professors were consulted about the new computer.

According to Computer Services Director Robert DeSieno, a precise cost estimate is not yet available. DeSieno did, however, give a ballpark figure of $500,000 to the faculty at their October 8 meeting. The extra costs of training the large number of students and faculty needed to form the “critical mass" of people with computer experience will push that figure up, DeSieno said. Chemistry Professor and Assistant Dean of the Faculty Nicholas Burnett, a member of the Computer Service Planning Committee, added that no cost estimate will be available until the College chooses a specific computer system. The estimate most frequently quoted as the total cost of the program is between $750,000 and $1 million, according to Physics Department Chairman Locke White. The NSF limited its grants to $250,000, White said. DeSieno, who has been a member of NSF panels for the review of grants proposals, said the money from the grant would be used to teach computer usage to students and faculty members to conduct summer workshops in computer training. DeSieno estimated Davidson's chance of being awarded an NSF grant at 25%.

DeSieno was upset to learn that some faculty members felt poorly informed about the computer center. He said that the faculty had received a detailed report from him describing the computer program on September 25. In the report, DeSieno listed the following assumptions about Davidson:

—The mission of the College is to offer a superior liberal arts education.
—Davidson College must be a leader among liberal arts colleges in the field of computer services.
—The availability of a modern comprehensive computer system will be essential (See Computer, page 3)
