New Professors Martin And Colakis

By CHRIS HUGHES

Professor David Martin is a new face in the Economics department this year. Martin comes from the University of Illinois where he received a Ph.D. in economics with an emphasis in statistics. He will teach Economics 101, Econometrics, Statistics, and Environmental Economics. As a first-year teacher, Martin says one of his biggest challenges is to translate economic theory to the level of the beginning 101 level course. However, he wants to develop as an economist and he feels teaching will be the best way.

When asked about what brought him to Davidson, Martin mentioned the size and atmosphere of the school. In particular, he pointed out the advantages of being at a school with a mixed and varied program because, he said, economics interacts with history, political science, and other liberal arts. He feels that the classes here are competitive but have a healthy competition as opposed to the lie, cheat, and steal to win attitude found in other schools. The Honor Code here also struck him as important. He said he was surprised to see it could work so well. To show this, he talked about a Spanish textbook that has been in the lobby of Chambers for more than a week because no one wants to take it.

Finally, he said that the size of Davidson was good for him since he attended undergraduate school at DePauw in Indiana. In his free time, Martin and his wife Diane, who teaches economics at UNC-Charlotte, enjoy swimming, biking, and watching Illinois football, which he frequently discusses before class.

Professor Marianthe Colakis

Among the many changes taking place in the Classics department is the addition of Professor Marianthe Colakis. Colakis comes to Davidson from New York City where she taught Classics at Queens College and Brooklyn College. Prior to that, she was on the faculty of Trinity College of Hartford, Ct. She holds a B.A. from Barnard and a Ph.D. from Yale with emphasis in Senecan tragedies.

Here at Davidson, Colakis is teaching Elementary Greek, Readings in Latin Prose and Poetry, Intermediate Latin, and Mythology. Teaching remains her first priority, and she wants to interest as many people as possible in the study of Classics, she said. In her spare time, Colakis loves cooking and movies.

Coming from New York, Colakis has obviously found many things different about life at Davidson. Most importantly, she has found the weather in North Carolina much more hospitable. She said she is also impressed by the friendliness of the faculty and students here and the small-town atmosphere. As opposed to Yale, she has found no “town and gown” disputes, she said. She compared it to her time at schools in New York adding that “in an urban campus, life doesn’t revolve around the college.”

campus.” Most of the students would come to classes and lead an entirely separate life outside of school, she said. Her biggest adjustment so far, she said, was driving a car, since there are no taxis or buses in Davidson.

Professors Corrigan And Albinder
By TEMO TARRAGO

Something Classics Professor Peter Corrigan, who joined the faculty here this fall, thinks he will miss this year is a cold and white Christmas. Davidson may get cold, he said, but nothing compared with his hometown of St. Paul, Minn. Corrigan earned his B.A. at the University of Minnesota, then he moved east to Cornell University, where he received his M.A. and is presently finishing his Ph.D. All three degrees are in Classics. He is happy to be part of Davidson's Classics department, because, he said, it is a unique program with opportunities, such as the major in Classical Civilization, which are not available in most small colleges.

Though his move to Davidson had some complications, he finds it a clean and attractive community, with a “postcard charm.” He believes that Davidson has many benefits lacking in other schools, such as its small-town atmosphere near an urban community and the attention paid to each student.

He noticed that people here are warm and the students are healthy-looking; the climate here, he said, may have something to do with it. One of Corrigan’s biggest impressions is the dedication and commitment of the professors. He is still getting adjusted to the huge demand of time in institutional functions. That may be why he has not visited the lake campus yet, even though he enjoys sailing.

Professor Frank Albinder
Davidson's new music Professor Frank Albinder is a Los Angeles native who received his B.A. in music from Pomona College in California and two master's degrees from Boston's New England Conservatory of Music. When Boston's big-city atmosphere and lack of Mexican restaurants became too much, Albinder headed for North Carolina. He found the change rewarding. Davidson's atmosphere reminds him of Pomona’s friendliness and sense of community, he said.

Albinder considers students here intelligent, eager to cooperate and learn, and he notices they have good relationships with professors. He has met a number of students interested in music, he said, but many consider it a hobby rather than an academic pursuit and do not devote as much time to it as they would like. Albinder's field is music written before 1750. Singing is one of his main activities, and he travels regularly to sing bass baritone in a choir. Between his travels he finds time to practice his cooking and watch “I Love Lucy” reruns.
