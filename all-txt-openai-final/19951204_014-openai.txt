**Cats run record to 3-0**
**Men's basketball winning streak includes first victory over SEC foe in 30 years**

Behind balanced, high-powered scoring and tenacious defense, Davidson dominated Division III Catholic University on Saturday afternoon at Belk Arena, posting
a thorough 101-59 thrashing.

**MEN'S BASKETBALL**

"I was delighted with our offense," head coach Bob McKillop said. "I think the chemistry was very good tonight."

Five Wildcats scored in double figures, as forward Narcisse Ewodo led the way with 17, along with 7 rebounds. Brandon
Williams and Quinn Harwood each registered 16, while Ray Minlend and David Burns notched a dozen. Mark McGuire (8 points,
including two dunks), Ben Ebong (a solid 7 points and 7 boards), and point guard Chris Alpert (2 points, 4
assists, 5 rebounds, and most importantly, no turnovers) also played well.

"His stat-line isn’t going to look sterling, but Chris had an outstanding game tonight," praised McKillop. "He made the players
on the court better by making very simple passes. He was as responsible for our points as the guy who
put it in the basket."

The win upped Davidson’s mark to 3-0, their first such start since 1992. Conversely, Catholic dropped to 1-3. After the
Cardinals jumped out to an early 4-0 lead, the Wildcats responded with authority establishing leads of 17-8 and 32-17 on
their way to a 46-23 advantage at intermission.

The second half proved no friendlier for the overwhelmed Catholic crew, as Davidson shot 54.3% from the field and tallied
55 points to eliminate the slightest comeback possibility. The scrappy and effective play of guard Sammy Briggs (16 points and
7 assists) was the lone bright spot for Catholic.

Boasting a consistent 30-point lead throughout, a game-ending 19-4 Wildcats run produced the final outcome, as an emphatic Ebong dunk
ended the game.

In addition to Saturday’s game, the Wildcats traveled to Oxford, MS, last Monday night and topped Ole Miss of the
SEC, 84-83 in overtime. Unlike the win over Catholic, the Wildcats constituted a two-man show versus the Rebels, as Williams
(32 points) and Minlend (27) combined for 70% of Davidson’s total. Williams performed best in the clutch, registering eight of
the 10 Wildcats points in the extra period, including the game-winner with 19 seconds left.

The victory was the first for Davidson over an SEC foe since they beat Mississippi State, 72-60, during the 1965-66
campaign, when a 21-7 (11-1 in the Southern Conference) squad advanced to the NCAA East Regional semifinals, eventually falling to
Syracuse.

This fast start is promising, as Davidson seems to possess the ability to earn a postseason bid this year. The
Wildcats last experienced March Madness in 1994 with an NIT bid, while they traveled to the NCAAs in 1986. The
team returns to action Tuesday night at UNC-Wilmington, while N.C. State visits Belk Arena Saturday at 3:30, the first of
three straight games.

**Women's basketball sprints into season**

The women’s basketball team has rolled to two straight wins after dropping their season opener 87-74 to host St. Mary’s
at the St. Mary’s tourney in Moraga, Calif.

**WOMEN'S BASKETBALL**

They rebounded to defeat Northeast Louisiana in the consolation game of the tourney 72-55, and ran past Wofford 93-55 in
their home opener last Wednesday.The Wildcats went on the road again over the weekend, traveling to the Pittsburgh (Pa.) tournament.
They lost in the first round on Saturday, 75-55 to Rhode Island. “We have high expectations for this season,” said
senior Kristen Ferrucci, who presently leads the team in scoring with over 17 points per game. “We have some really
good new talent, and some girls that should step it up a notch. We haven't been very successful in the
last couple of years, but this season we should start making noise with wins and compete at the top of
the Southern Conference.”

Kerry Brown, one of the freshmen to whom Ferrucci was referring, has already made a huge impact, being named to
the all-tournament team in California and leading the team in assists with nearly eight per game. In the two games
in California, she racked up 25 points, 20 rebounds, 15 assists, 2 blocks, and 2 steals. The other first-year players
are Jamie Brown, who has been unable to play this season due to injury; Jessica Montrella, who has been nursing
an elbow injury but returned to the roster for the win over Wofford; Carrie Sloan, and Nora Kizer, both of
whom saw their first action in the win over Wofford.

“They [the freshmen] are stepping up the program a notch. We have always had extremely good talent, but they are
giving us the boost to take us to the next step,” Ferrucci said. “They make the game fun, and some
of the things they do are truly amazing. They are definitely going to take this team places. I just hope
they do it this year so we [the seniors] can see it.”
