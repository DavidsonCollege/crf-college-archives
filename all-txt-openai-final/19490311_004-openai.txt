LOCAL BIBLE MENTOR...
(Continued From Page One)
set forth that method of study by which the Protestant Church may study its Bible.” The author claims that the book has relevance not only for the students of the Bible but also for those studying in the Arts and Sciences. Here are two statements made by prominent churchmen about the book and its author:

Dr. John R. Mott, “It is worthy of high praise... very revealing and vital, and affords invaluable lessons for those engaged in theological seminary work either as teachers or students...”

Dr. Howard Tillman Kuist, Princeton Theological Seminary, “I am very sure that Wilbert Webster White himself would not only be pleased, but that he would be tremendously gratified at the result of your arduous months of toil. You have not only organized a mass of well-nigh unorganizable material, but you have sifted out the essential fabric of a narrative-exposition which is readable, understandable, and attractive, exciting.”

John R. Mott has ordered 200 copies of the book and his statement, located strategically, are sent to churchmen and educators all over the world. Negotiations are also being made for the sale and distribution of the book in the British Isles. The book, published by the Associated Press, may be ordered through the bookstore at $3.50 a copy, and they will arrive in about two weeks from the date ordered.

AMONG THE GREEKS...

are planning the naval strategy for the night. Senator Jack S. Lyles Calhoun, the noted South Carolina sage, is in the library giving lessons on nullification and secession to his junior legislator, Tony Preston Brooks Tucker, who in turn is extemporizing on the fine art of fencing with canes. F.P. King, the taxi-cab tycoon who operates between Davidson and Bristol, is apparently speaking to everyone. He is undoubtedly lobbying for the Confederate Army franchise for transportation. Rhett “Social Sam” Butler, the Don Juan of Tara fame and still in the house, is along with Wild Bill Forrest and General Gilmer covering the shot. I now return you to H. V. Kaltenborn at the Old Ball following the arrival of all the notables. The dance, which is now underway, has just begun to the tune of “Beat Me Daddy, Eight to the Bar,” played by Spiked Knauff and his Queeries. It appears though the Knights of the House of David are getting along fine with their dates, so I now return you to CBS where 99 million Dixiecrats gather every week.

PHI DELTA THETA
The land of eternal sunshine had Ed Hartley, Founding Fathers last weekend, the whole weekend among the sun and fun attractions of Tallahassee. They even arranged a little beach party and were having a delightful time until Hollister began to pour his talents in song. Otherwise, the party was a success. Hartley was not impressed by the beautiful scenery; he only went down to discuss the future of Phi Delta Theta with his buddy, Frank Wright. The boys ran up on Campbell wandering around the streets in his band uniform. He strongly protested that he had not taken up that old New Year’s Eve habit. He wasBrought back Davidson and put to bed. Ed extended his visit again, safely until Tuesday. Reports say Faye had him out looking for more burned-out clinkers for the fire. The Lodge was a great success. Brother Guthrie and his vote of thanks. Covell suffered humiliation but remedied this with his new setting position. Our poet, Klein, played songs on the guitar while Dot danced with the brothers. Joe Miller twirled the girls while “Big Bill” shuffled his tiny feet and learned to “shag.” Bob Knight plans to sue the chewing gum manufacturers. His date reports a smacking good time. According to Vann, “snow queens” are not out of season. Lonnie rolled in late, but in function at Erwin crew deserve a love.

street. This walkway will run just in front of the new church when it is erected. Another much-needed improvement will be the paving of the road around Duke Dormitory. Also, the parking areas between Georgia and West, and East and West, will be surfaced. Some patching will be done on the “D” road on the front campus.

COLUMBIA SEMINARY...

formed an almost unbelievable task. With this as an example, he exhorted the students to take what talents the Lord has given them and to put them to use in the best manner possible for service to Him. The program was closed with a prayer by Eade Anderson.

The Democratic party is getting into old form. The boys are feuding and fussing over the proposed tax boost. Dr. Will Durant says that the world situation will be fouled. Isn't it a pity there is no other world for us to go to?

Time to give the girls a thrill, Lamb and Hooper were officially admitted to the Order of Lower Reptiles. Lambeth is swatting the ball around nicely at the beginning of the season. J. Cobb is not hitting too well, even with Brownson pitching. It seems Jables has had society problems. Vann and Pritchett will fill two of the three places for Davidson in the 1949 Florida Relays. Ed Sutton won't make it. Because of a bad leg, he didn’t qualify for the high jump. Don't delay. Get your dates now for the Blue and White Ball.

“HOG SHOOTIN’”...

include the Vereen Bell Award-winning story in its first issue of the following year. With permission of the author, the award-winning story will be published in the first issue of Scripts and Pranks next year. The two stories receiving honorable mention will probably be published in the final issue of this year. Members of the English Department of the Davidson faculty served as judges of the Vereen Bell Contest in conjunction with Mr. Harry Shaw. Of the thirty creative articles entered in the contest, some of the better ones were selected by members of the English Department for final approval by Mr. Shaw.

ligament, three which he has participated, he has won two and lost one. He also is considered as having a very good chance in the conference tournament which is coming up soon. Mott is a brother of the Sigma Chi fraternity and a member of the “D” Club.
