THE DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 11, 1934

Frat Houses Receive New Coats of Paint

Various Other Improvements Are Also Being Made

Superintendent of Grounds F. D. Hobart announced today that the first coat of paint had been applied to all the houses in Fraternity Court and that a second coating would follow immediately. Five students and one painter with previous experience are working on the project, which is expected to require several weeks to complete. The estimated cost of painting the fraternity houses is two hundred and fifty dollars. After painting the houses, the roofs of Dormitory Row will be treated with a special weather-proof paint.

In addition to the painting projects, the campus is being improved generally. To date, approximately seventy-five per cent of the campus trees have been trimmed by expert tree surgeons and about fifty trees along Maple Row have been treated with fertilizer.

Davidson Debaters Defeat Opponents

Brown and Pratt-Thomas Defeat Virginians Before Large Crowd

Davidson debaters were opposed by a team from Washington and Lee on the night of Wednesday, the 28th of March. Taking the affirmative, represented by Skip Brown and Rawling Pratt-Thomas, Davidson won the decision by a vote of two to one. The subject under discussion was, “Resolved, that the President of the United States should have his powers substantially increased.” The debate was held in Chambers Auditorium at 8 o'clock before the largest crowd in four years. A large number of townspeople were present in addition to student and faculty members. Ed Humphrey presided. Judges were Clarence Kuester of Charlotte, Rev. Clark of St. Peters Church in Charlotte, and W. H. Thompson of Davidson.

’CAT CINDERMEN DEFEAT RICHMOND
(Continued from page 4)

own record for the discus and Earle Frazier setting a new Davidson record for the mile, the Wildcat track team defeated the University of Richmond tracksters on Richardson Field Saturday by the score of 74-52. The ’Kitten track team, however, went down before the Richmond freshmen, 85-31. Cochran threw the plate 138 feet, 4½ inches and Frazier took the mile in 4 minutes, 38.1 seconds, to break by .7 seconds the record set by Soup Brannon two years ago. Evans took Davidson high scoring honors for the day, winning firsts in the 100 and 220-yard dashes and third in the 220-yard low hurdles. Starring for Richmond was Chaltain, who took firsts in the broad jump and the 120-yard high hurdles and a second in the 220-yard low hurdles. In the long runs Davidson particularly starred, Frazier, Morrow and Shuford taking all three places in the mile run, Gullette and Glass running off with first and second in the two-mile, and Frazier and Oakes taking first and second in the 880. In a meet punctuated by short rains, both teams turned in some excellent performances. Lee and Pittman, inspired by the skill of Richmond pole vaulters, tied for first in the vault, going 11 feet, 6 inches short of the Davidson record. Dickson was the only star of the ‘Kittens’ outclassed performance. He took first in the 100-yard dash and, after breaking a toe and placing second in the 120-yard high hurdles, took first in the high jump. Honors for the Richmond frosh are divided between Cohen, Brown and Lumpkin.

What it means
Everything that Science knows about is used in making Chesterfields. One thing we do is to buy mild, ripe tobaccos and then lock up these tobaccos in modern storage warehouses to age and mellow like rare wines. It takes about 3 years to age the tobaccos for your Chesterfield, for — to store 70 million dollars worth of tobacco in 2½ miles of warehouses. Time does something to tobacco that neither man nor machine can do. It means something to keep 70 million dollars worth of tobacco in storage. It means just this: We do everything possible to make Chesterfield the cigarette that’s milder, the cigarette that tastes better.
