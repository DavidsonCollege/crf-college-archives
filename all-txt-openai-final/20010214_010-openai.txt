Rugby takes undefeated record into spring season

By Garrett F. RICHEY, Guest Writer

With only mouth guards and electrical tape to protect them, the Davidson rugby team charges onto the intramurals field amid
a small crowd of dedicated fans and the opposing team's vicious taunts. The football team wasn’t the only squad that
went undefeated last season. Every Saturday, at the same time, the Davidson rugby team defeated all eight of its opponents.

Despite sharing the spotlight with the football team, which resulted in small crowd support and, sometimes, the absence of an
athletic trainer, the 20 members of the rugby team didn’t lose a game, an incredible feat considering that Davidson was
both outnumbered and outsized on numerous occasions. Out of all the victories, the most memorable moment for nearly every team
member was a 20-5 rout of archrival and rugby powerhouse Appalachian State.

“It was probably the best rugby match that Davidson has ever played,” said senior Andy Coddington. “We played like a
true team. We rucked together, we moved the ball together, and we won together. I was very proud of our
performance.”

The victory is even more surprising when you consider that the Mountaineers brought their traveling team, which totals about 45
players compared to Davidson’s 20. “It is one of the greatest moments in rugby that I have ever had,” said
senior captain Travis Harp. “I have seen a lot of matches where our individual performances have won games, but this
time it was different. We played hard as a team.”

Every Tuesday and Thursday, the team meets at the IMAC fields at 4 p.m. to practice. For two hours, they
endure rigorous workouts and drills that focus on passing, running, hitting, scrumming, and rucking. After the drills are completed to
head coach Paul Kenny’s satisfaction, the team scrimmages for an hour. When Kenny, a middle-aged rugby veteran with bad knees
and a failing back who scrimmages with them, is pleased, practice ends with conditioning drills.

“Whatever we do in practice, whether it be passing drills, scrimmaging, or conditioning, is to help us play better as
a team,” said Kenny. “By playing well as a team, we can expect to win more matches. It is that
simple.”

The rugby team will have to continue to play well as the spring schedule approaches. Tough teams from around the
state will try to hand the team its first loss, including Furman, North Carolina, Duke, South Carolina, and the measuring
stick of North Carolina rugby, Western Carolina. Each match until March 11 will be on Sundays at 1 p.m. at
the IMAC fields.

“It really does not matter if we win or lose as long as we play together, play to our potential,
and, most of all, have fun doing it,” said Harp. “I am having the best time of my life. I
am playing the game that I love with a bunch of great guys. What more could I ask for?”

How about a perfect 13-0 record?

Rugby tops Western Carolina

By Garrett RICHEY, Guest Writer

As the clock slowly ticked down, the once rowdy and rambunctious Western Carolina fans stood silent. For eighty minutes they
had watched their heavily-favored Catamounts (8-1) not score once against the undersized Davidson Wildcats (10-0). This past Sunday, the Davidson
Rugby Club proved their fortitude once again by destroying rugby powerhouse Western Carolina in a 19-0 victory.

The Wildcats dominated from the opening kickoff. Senior Andy Coddington’s kick was swarmed by the Davidson defense, which put the
Catamounts in bad field position. Seven minutes into the match, Davidson drew first blood with a penalty kick by Senior
Andy Coddington that put the Wildcats up 3-0. With about twenty minutes remaining...Minutes into the match, Western Carolina mounted a
drive that would leave Davidson with their backs to the Catamounts' try zone. But the Wildcats held their own with
a tremendous defensive effort, great rucking, and a great kick by Matt Haist that not only cleared the ball out
but also gave the Wildcats good field position for the line-out. At halftime, the score was 13-0 thanks to the
priceless foot of Senior Andy Coddington, who nailed a penalty kick from twenty-two meters just before the half.

The start of the second half of play was marked by great defensive efforts by both teams. Both the Wildcats
and the Catamounts mounted drives that put them in good field position but came up short after several great goal-line
stances. That is until Western Carolina’s eightman got too emotional and started a fight with not only some Davidson players
but also the Davidson fans. He was sent to the Sin Bin for five minutes, and Davidson was given an
opportunity to put the match away with a penalty kick. Andy Coddington once again took the kick and scored from
twenty-two meters out, which gave the Cats an impressive 16-0 lead with less than eighteen minutes left to play.

While Western Carolina’s eightman was in the Sin Bin, Davidson took the initiative and mounted a four-minute drive that resulted
in a penalty due to unfair play by the Catamounts' scrumhalf. Once again, Andy Coddington, amid the opposing team's jeers
and taunts, kicked a thirty-meter field goal that clinched the game for the Wildcats with a final score of 19-0.

“We have waited for this win for a long time,” senior prop Dave Nutt said. “Western is a very good
rugby team. If you can beat them, then you are doing something right.” The Man of the Match Award went
to Andy Coddington, who scored twelve solo points with his golden foot. “I really don’t care about the award,” said
Coddington. “I am honored, but what really matters is that we beat Western Carolina and we have the opportunity to
make it to the state tournament. The award should really go to the entire team; we played long and hard,
and we did it together.”

The Wildcats will play Furman next Sunday at 1 p.m. on the IMAC fields. If they win next week, then
Davidson will qualify for the state tournament and have the opportunity to play in the state championship match, a first
for Davidson Rugby. “I told the team before the match that there was something in the air,” said Senior and
Captain Travis Harp. “I told them that there was no way we were going to lose this match. I could
feel it.”

Attendance at men’s basketball games has fallen this season, but school officials say the decline has more to do with
the team’s mediocre record than ticket prices. Belk Arena averages 2,500 fans against Division I opponents, said Ticket Office Manager
Lee Sargent. On many nights, the lower level is half empty. A recent Davidsonian study found that a family of
two adults and two teenagers pays more to attend a game at Davidson than at any other Southern Conference school.
Depending on the ages of its children, a family can pay as much as $50 for parking, tickets, and concessions.

Still, Sargent is convinced that unexciting basketball—not money—is what’s keeping people away. “It all depends on how our team is
playing and the quality of our opponents,” he said. “In 1996 (when the Wildcats went 25-5) it was hard to
find a red seat. Our record isn’t as good (this season), so fewer people come.”

With three regular season games remaining, two of them at home, the Wildcats are in fourth place out of six
teams in the SoCon’s South Division with a record of 11-15, including 5-8 in the conference. Between 1995 and 1998,
when the team averaged 21 wins per season, average attendance was as high as 3,500, Sargent said. While the Wildcats’
record may change next season, ticket prices probably won’t. “If I had people saying ‘you guys are charging too much,’
I might say ‘maybe we’re making a mistake,’” said Sargent. “I have not heard that.”

Appalachian State opened the 8,300-seat Seby B. Jones Arena this season but decided not to raise its $8 ticket prices—in
part out of consideration for its fans. “We didn’t want to be accused of a gouge situation,” said associate director
of athletics Mark Dreibelbis. “We tried to be concerned about our patrons.”

To compare Belk Arena prices to those at schools such as Appalachian State is unfair, says Sargent, because of Davidson’s
location in the affluent North Mecklenburg area. “We fit in the right niche of the Charlotte entertainment area for what
we charge,” he said. “We sell this as great family entertainment. I think it is.”
