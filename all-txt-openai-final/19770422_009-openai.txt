campus, complaining loudly in
either instance.

The Union Board Executive
Committee (UBEC), the principal
programmers for the
campus, profess to welcome
student input, but they either
ignore or reject most proposals.
Even the Committee
chairmen have problems working
through (or around) the
UBEC so that they may
program.

Instead of providing leadership
for both the Union Board
and the students, the UBEC
functions as a stumbling
block.

(Hunter Jennings)

Committee chairpeople have
to avoid the UBEC to get
anything done. Externally, the
UBEC appears to be hard at
work, putting in two or three
hours every afternoon in C.
Shaw Smith’s office to “program.”

The business transacted in
these meetings might take
fifteen minutes if handled
efficiently. The sessions turn
into gripe sessions, preventing
people seriously interested in
programming from getting
anything done.

Very little communication
exists between the UBEC and
the Committee chairmen. No
agenda is available before
Board meetings, and the
UBEC members seem to resent
the fact that Board
members are interested in
what they will discuss beforehand.

work is supposed to be a fun
experience and this is usually
the case for those who do
participate.

Hutchings says that another
problem related to the
difficulty of student participation
is that the Union is not
the only source of extracurricular
function on campus.
Some success has been achieved
in making the Union
Davidson’s social-cultural
center. He acknowledges,
though, that the Union does
experience some limited “competition”
from Patterson
Court.

However, the Court social
system is not completely in its
range of activities. This is
where the UBEC sees the
Union fitting in, to fill in these
gaps and even to be an
alternative to the Court when
someone is looking for something
different to see or do.

The point that the members
of the UBEC emphasize the
strongest is that it takes the
students to make the Union
committees what they think it should be.

They encourage students to
get involved with the Union so
that it can realize its potential
as the socio-cultural center of
Davidson College.

College Union and the campus,
works in strange ways.

While professing to welcome
student input, the body turns
away suggestions.

The UBEC serves as one
more frustrating element in
Davidson College, and they
should be relieving frustration.

Students did elect these
people; students should demand
the UBEC meet their
needs.

Solicited students respond to
Union’s programming policy

The Davidsonian solicited
student opinion of the College
Union. The following statements
are a sample of the
responses:

“It’s a right nice hole.”

“I like it. It’s better than
not having a union.”

“I think they’re making a
great deal of progress and
offering a variety of things.”

“We need more music in the
900 Room. They have those
super speakers and they never
turn them on.”

“I think the 900 Room
should be open until 3:00.”

“First tell me what they’re
doing.”

“Well, I have this to say
about the Union, I think it’s
very unionized and I’m glad I
am at Davidson College and
God is alive.”

“They’re acting like they’re
not spending any money.”

“The groups they’ve had in
the 900 Room are pretty
shitty.”

“I want to be able to drink
beer anywhere in the Union.”

“Union? What Union?”

“We do have a snack bar.”

“The Union is doing a fine
job now.”

“I don’t think the students
use it enough.”

“I wish they’d keep the

decorations on the wall of the
snack bar.”

“It’s been adequate, but not
exceptional. We haven’t had
any good concerts since fall
term.”

“Inadequate facilities for
concerts are partly to blame,
also inadequate student body
to finance and draw really
good concerts.”

“Several years ago the concert
committee was less reluctant
to ‘gamble’ on rising
people or different types of
music (ex.: Dave Brubeck,
Muddy Waters, etc.).”

“I think it’s been OK. I
think they’ve gone out of their
way to decorate the Union and
give it atmosphere. I really
liked that Indian dinner. I
wish they wouldn’t orient all
of their programs around drinking.
Their posters with slogans
like ‘come have a beer
with us’ don’t really seem
necessary. It’s OK once or
twice, but not all the time.”

“I don’t know what they
can do about it, but I generally
go other places for my
entertainment. There have
been some good things in the
900 Room like the clown and
the sitarists. I haven’t liked
the concert programming
since freshman year though.”
