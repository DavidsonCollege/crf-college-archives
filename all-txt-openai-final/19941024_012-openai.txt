**Music Review**

**Liz Phair scores with her new album Whip-Smart**

By Jacob Abraham

After the impressive sales and tremendous critical acclaim that accompanied her debut album, Exile in Guyville, Liz Phair has returned
with a strong sophomore effort. Musically, Whip-Smart serves a polished dose of guitar pop that goes down much more easily
than her last album. Her pointed lyrics once again attack male-female relationships from all sorts of different angles. This time,
however, it seems that the over-sexed “bad girl” of Guyville is finally interested in settling down.

The album opens with a hint that the wild-and-fast lifestyle provides Phair with little satisfaction. The speaker of “Chopsticks” walks
away from the one-night stand, admitting that “secretly, I’m timid.” On the first single, “Supernova,” Phair takes the classic pop
love song and twists it into a punk-rock babe’s pledge of undying devotion. Her praise for her lover is brilliantly
fresh and incisive: “Your kisses are as wicked as an M-16... you’re everything to me.”

This description characterizes the men in Phair’s songs: hopelessly hip, mysterious, and sexy in spite of their restlessness. As she
sings on another track, “You’re an x-ray man / You got an x-rated mind / You’re not satisfied looking at
me / You’re always checkin’ out the girl behind.” Yet her women refuse to take a passive role; they aren’t
afraid to tease or manipulate, and they manage to stay in control of their situations. In the midst of emotional
struggles, they maintain an irresistibly cool aloofness.

Several of the songs reveal a certain softness beneath the speaker’s tough exterior—perhaps providing a glimpse into the woman behind
the Liz Phair image. On the title track, Phair gives us her perspective on a mother’s hopes for her son.
Not only should he be handsome, intelligent, and cautious but also lively and uninhibited: “I’m going to lock my son
up in a tower till he learns to let his hair down far enough to climb outside.”

On “Nashville,” perhaps the most personal song on the album, Phair expresses her own discouragement with the burdens of success.
She understands that the forces which currently promote her are likely to reject her when the novelty of her style
wears off. The song closes with a declaration to remain true to her music and not buckle under the pressures
of the recording industry: “Now I don’t crack the door too far for anyone who’s pushing too hard on me...
I won’t decorate my love.”

This album again displays Phair’s brilliant use of layered vocals and her rough yet diverse singing range. She weaves simple
harmonies and disjointed sounds into infectiously memorable songs, laden with subtle hooks. Much of Guyville’s dark edge has been replaced
by upbeat themes and slick production standards, but the moods of the songs frequently vary. “Shane,” a somber blues number,
sounds and feels like it was recorded in a dark garage or a smoky bar. The stark piano and guitar
feedback on “Chopsticks” echoes the mood of her first album, while the country-western guitar of “May Queen” closes the album
on a hopeful note.

The fact that she wrote and produced all the songs on Whip-Smart proves Phair’s ability to maintain control over her
work and her image; she even directed the first video from the album herself. Old fans may be disappointed that
some of her snarl has been traded for a hopeful smile, but her willingness to grow as a musician saves
her from the folly of repeating herself. The album’s biggest flaw may be its lack of depth; averaging at about
three minutes apiece, the songs on Whip-Smart serve mainly as brief observations and snippets of insight. Perhaps a good producer
could whip some more substance out of her future efforts.

**Athens band Stephanie Finger features alum, plays music from punk to 1970s guitar rock**

By Rachel Newcomb

On October 29, former Davidson student Peter Jackson will be returning to Davidson with his Athens-based band, Stephanie Finger. The
band is made up of four members: Sean Hogan on bass, Steve Phillips as lead vocalist,Max Howard on guitar, and
Jackson on drums. Formed in Santa Fe, New Mexico, the band was a trio until they moved to Athens, Georgia
and picked up Peter Jackson. Their music runs the gamut of influences from punk to 70s-based guitar rock. “You could
say we’re somewhere in between the Sex Pistols and the Rolling Stones,” Jackson says. Well-crafted melodies combine with quick, brash
rock and roll to create a sound that is both forceful and dynamic. The Athens Flagpole calls the band “four
guys who play loud guitars that want to hurt you.” Stephanie Finger is an excellent up-and-coming band on the vibrant
Athens music scene. Jackson says that they have been playing in Athens a good bit, as well as Birmingham, Alabama,
and other locations around Georgia. You can catch their act at KA on Saturday, October 29 at 10 p.m.

Two impressive exhibits from Sutherland and Dasher

work deals with the fortunes and misfortunes of relationships. The aesthetic charm of the winding forms allude to both the
beauty of a dancer and the horror of a spiraling tornado. Dan Sutherland, a painter from San Antonio, Texas, was
also present for the walk-through. One might be initially intrigued by the enormous, detailed crates which hold Sutherland’s work. However,
according to Sutherland, this aspect should not be seen as primary to his work. “After all,” expressed Sutherland, “the crates
took me a week to make, while the paintings were a year in the making.” Nevertheless, the casings do make
an interesting addition to the work.

Sutherland shows an incredible mastery of oil paints. The compositions are tightly polished and, at times, intricately detailed. His paintings
often allude to other works in the art world and even contain references to Renaissance painting and other traditions. Like
Dasher, Sutherland has an incredible ability to combine objective painting with total abstraction. In I Wish I Could Help You,
a magician figure with wand and hat is surrounded by highly decorated, billowing forms. Some of the works in Sutherland’s
show contain drawings, since he sees his paintings as a result of a long process with many drawings. These works
are “open-ended” according to Sutherland, in comparison with his painting.

Both of these shows are highly impressive and the Davidson Art Department invites students, faculty, and members of the community
to come and appreciate the new shows. Dasher’s works are showing in the Van Every Gallery in the VAC until
December 14, and Sutherland’s work may be seen in the Smith Gallery until November 15.
