### Student Counseling

The administration is finally making genuine progress toward providing adequate counseling services for students. The plan to finance two half-time clinical psychologists for next year is certainly an improvement over the present situation. We hope, however, that this is the first step in a continuing process to upgrade available counseling at Davidson. The atmosphere at this college seems to suppress genuine expression of emotion and this is unhealthy.

The training for freshman Hall Counselors became more rigorous in the last year under Dean of Students Will Terry’s direction, and we hope the administration will continue this trend. Hall Counselors can play an invaluable role in aiding the adjustment of freshmen to Davidson.

While improvements have been made in these areas, other phases of counseling are ignored or allowed to function without adequate direction. The administration continues to allow faculty members to advise freshmen without any program of training or orientation to prepare faculty for this vital role. Freshmen advisors should be carefully selected for personal enthusiasm and genuine desire to help. They should be schooled in counseling techniques and prepared to deal with psychological concerns. No faculty member should be a freshman advisor unless he is both willing and capable to handle personal problems.

The dilemma of the sophomore presents another neglected counseling problem. The sophomore has probably adjusted to his college environment, but he still faces three long years at Davidson, uncertain about his major and his college future. The sophomore is in a sort of counseling limbo, neglected by his freshman advisor but not ready to choose a major advisor. A positive effort to help the sophomore find a direction in his college career would be a vital asset to the college counseling program.

But the most important support to any college counseling program is the students themselves. If each student could discard his self-centered intellectual attitude and take an interest in the feelings of others, emotional problems here would be reduced. The most important part of counseling is listening, and the most effective listener is often the student who shows concern for the problems of his peers. Every student has a role in making Davidson a less lonely place.

While we have made progress in some areas of counseling, more needs to be accomplished. And all members of the college have a responsibility to make Davidson more livable.

### Grievance Committee

The Peeples SGA administration gathered momentum this week with the establishment of the Grievance Committee. As the bureaucracy on the first floor of Chambers expands with ever-increasing vigor, it is not uncommon for students with a problem to be shifted from one administrative office to another. Recognizing these problems, the senate has set up a committee of six students to cut through administrative red tape and strengthen communications between the administration and the rest of the college.

A significant attribute of the Grievance Committee is that it gives personalized service to each person with a problem. Each case will be handled on an individual basis and the case will be kept confidential upon request. The administration has failed to give students the personal attention they require; consequently, the Senate has moved to fill the gap.

Another significant attribute is that the Grievance Committee will serve the entire campus community. Not only will students benefit from the service, but faculty, staff, townspeople, and even other administrators may request help from the committee. Many such attempts to provide services for students have failed in the past because of student apathy. We hope that this committee will not fade away because of lack of interest. But in order for it to survive, the Grievance Committee must also have the cooperation of the administration. Since the students are doing what the administration should be doing, we hope they will at least take time out to answer the queries of these students.

College President Samuel R. Spencer Jr. has expressed his full support for this program, and we hope his Vice Presidents and their subordinates will do the same. This is just the first phase of Peeples’ overall plan to improve student services on campus. He has made a good start with the Grievance Committee, and we hope he will continue his efforts in this direction.

#### Counselors Protest Filth, Call For Custodial Reforms

By DICK CLAY and JOEL BRADLEY

The following is meant to convey a sense of dissatisfaction with the present setup of the janitorial system. Hopefully, from what we say, the Director of Personnel and Administrative Services, Mr. Robert J. Stephenson, will be able to draw some conclusions and take some actions which will be conducive to improved living conditions in the dormitories. These comments are, of course, limited to Cannon I since this is our area of “expertise.” Any action resulting from these comments will increase our awareness of the power of the student press.

Throughout the first term and half of the second, the bathroom on Cannon I was cleaned on the average of once a week. As can be well imagined, the bathroom became rather unpleasant towards the end of the week. Outside of this ritual cleaning, the only effort the janitor made was to empty the trash barrel daily.

We first complained at a Hall Counselor’s meeting early in the first term to Mrs. Nicholls, Director of Student Housing, who directed us to Mr. Meetze, Director of the Physical Plant, (bathrooms being outside of her sphere of influence), who in turn directed us to Mr. Gant, Superintendent of Custodians. Mr. Gant promised to speak to Sgt. Penley, Assistant Director of Custodians, who in turn spoke to us at 7 a.m. the following morning.

Observation No. 1: Having to go through four people, all of whom are salaried, and all of whom are directly or indirectly concerned with dormitory maintenance, makes for three too many overseers.

Sgt. Penley has a flair for dramatic entrances. Both of us were asleep when he...Flipped on the light, lit a cigarette, sat down on our chair without invitation, and read our Charlotte Observer as he talked. He asked us what our particular janitor had not been doing and consequently promised to have the bathroom cleaned on a regular basis. Before leaving, he said, and I quote, "Let’s keep this in the family"; i.e., tell him of custodial problems, rather than Mr. Gant. We assume this was to protect himself and his job. Consequently, we informed him the matter would stay "in the family" as long as our janitor performed his job adequately—which means disinfecting the bathroom daily along with emptying trash cans and sweeping rooms. Services improved for one or two weeks (the bathroom disinfected once a week and swept every day with a broom).

Observation No. 2: Sgt. Penley believes in the virtues of familial living. Upon commencement of the second term, conditions returned to their characteristic low, and we again contacted Mr. Gant, who again contacted Sgt. Penley, who again visited promptly at 7:30 in our room and asked that the matter be "kept in the family." Performance rose and then again fell in the same manner as it did after his first visit. When the service declined this time, we realized the utter uselessness of working through the Physical Plant office, and therefore called the Charlotte Health Department and asked for a sanitation rating on the Cannon I bathroom. They promptly obliged; however, before the inspection, they went to Mr. Meetze’s office, for apparently, they must be accompanied by a college official before they inspect. We do not know how much time lapsed between the time they entered the Physical Plant Office and the time of inspection, but miraculously, the Cannon I bathroom was magnificently disinfected minutes before the inspection.

Observation No. 3: The threat of a poor Public Health Office Sanitation rating on a dormitory bathroom must have significant repercussions in the Physical Plant Office. From this account, it is easy to see that Davidson is operating something approaching a paternalistic welfare system in regard to its custodians. The only times each day we have seen our janitor are in the early morning when he noisily bangs our trash cans around and throws our newspaper on top of Mr. Clay while he’s still in bed, and the early afternoon when he is watching soap operas in the Cannon Lounge. We do not think of ourselves as bigots, and we have been overly patient with the bureaucratic ins and outs of the Physical Plant Office, but we do not pay over $3,100 a year to acquire athlete's foot in the shower stall.

In our opinion, there are two solutions to this custodial laxity. 1) Fire all dormitory janitors after this year and provide a substantial number of work-study jobs for Davidson students as dormitory janitors. In addition, we urge that Sgt. Penley’s career be terminated, and that his job be turned over to the students on each hall. We feel that peer group pressure on the new student janitors would exert a yet-to-be-experienced bathroom sanitation. We see three advantages to this solution: 1) It would help the budget people with their rumored deficit problem, for the work-study jobs could be generated at a substantial savings over the present setup; 2) It would enable the Admissions and Financial Aid people to offset any possible budget cutbacks in their financial aid programs, and, 3) It would greatly add to the liberal education of many Davidson students to become familiar with the logistics of disinfecting toilet bowls. (We say this in all seriousness; the Protestant work ethic is not to be sneezed at). The single disadvantage is that this would directly repudiate the college's self-proclaimed commitment to the “continuing college community," specifically, that community existing on the other side of the railroad tracks. Not wishing to appear overly callous and entirely devoid of social consciousness, our second proposal does not involve firing any janitors. It centers itself on the quality of the supervisory staff and is based on the assumption that the quality of custodial room and bathroom care is directly correlated with the quality and quantity of supervision exercised by the Physical Plant Office. In light of our opinion that this supervision, at present, is painfully inadequate, we recommend rolling a few unnecessary heads. This proposal, by the way, would enable those responsible for initiating the head-rolling to put their hard-earned M.B.A.'s to visible use. In addition, it would aid in making our employees work for what we pay them, since these inefficient supervisors would necessarily be replaced by one person, who before he was hired would have to demonstrate to his hirers and to his workers that he was not a clown and could definitely command respect.
