Hooff and Paffenroth win at East Carolina

By CARO REYNOLDS

Facing an Eastern Carolina squad of depth and experience gave the men’s and women’s swimming and diving teams each a
loss, but not without several impressive performances.

SWIMMING & DIVING

Men’s captain Churchill Hooff turned in an impressive individual performance with first place finishes in three events: 200 individual medley
and 200 and 500 freestyle.

On the women’s side, freshman standout Kathleen Paffenroth swam her way to another school record in the 1000 free.

Freshman Jason Prince finished the IM right behind his captain, outtouching several ECU swimmers for second place. Freshmen Allison Hobgood
and Michael McCabe and senior John Rogers all turned in strong performances as well.

On the boards, sophomore diver Jonathan Frost gained points for the men’s team with skillful diving.

“They’re a big state school with big school funding. Outside the swimming facility there is an entire wall filled with
plaques of their All-American swimmers. They have had a strong program historically,” says Hooff.

There are no more team meets until after Christmas, but some of the men’s and women’s toughest competition has come
since they began their season on October 28. The men have won two of their seven meets: one against College
of Charleston and one against University of Richmond. The women have earned one victory against College of Charleston.

“The women’s team is very young, and we also have five of our juniors abroad, but we are definitely building
and improving. I think most of the women are happy with our performances so far,” says Paffenroth.

Hooff sees the men’s team in the same position of growth: “We should be able to compete with teams like
ECU in a few years.”

Go Cats!

Bob Yarborough, the rugby captain, said. He was largely responsible for keeping the team together and ensuring good communication between
the scrum and the backs which helped the Wildcats defeat the Fighting Christians.

Some might suggest the 1:46 Tyson/McNeeley fight lasted longer than the Davidson/Elon rugby match. After only one minute the Wildcats
scored their first try and converted the kick-after. During the ensuing 79 minutes, they piled on 75 additional points and
only gave up 5. At the final whistle, the Wildcats walked proudly off the field and out of their fall
season with an 82-5 victory.

RUGBY

“We wanted this game bad. Everyone contributed to making sure we finished with our heads high — and everyone deserves
credit for this massive blowout!”

Davidson dominated scrum play throughout the day, winning 90 percent of the set pieces and overpowering Elon in the rucks
and mauls. Props Mike Ingram and Roger Mills were the backbone of the effort. First-time hooker Eric Borgstrom, locks Will
Bradshaw and Casey Hawthorne, flankers Thayer Long and Chris Smith, and eight man Chris Frederick filled out the ‘Cats forceful
scrum.

“Good scrum play means good back play. That’s how rugby works: the scrum controls the ball, it is thrown to
the backs, and a try is scored,” Hank Ackerman, a sophomore center, said.

The Wildcat backs were able to consistently beat Elon’s inexperienced back line, reaping benefits from weeks of practice. Seth Carpenter
led the way with a hat-trick, Scott and Matt Burkhardt scored two each, rookie wing Jonathan Sipling, Ackerman, and fly-half
Warren Buford scored one try each to round out the ‘Cats scoring. The Burkhardt brothers and Carpenter also converted 11
of the 12 kick-afters between them.

Smart rugby won the game for the Wildcats. The Elon try, scored at the onset of the second half, came
after good second phase play by their backs and the bullet quickness of their substitute prop, Davidson alumnus Mike Kessler,
helped them muscle their way onto the scoreboard.

But Saturday belonged to the Wildcats, and they will head into the spring season in February with memories of this
very successful final game.
