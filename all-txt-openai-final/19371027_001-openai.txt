Honorary Societies Extend Bids

Omicron Delta Kappa Taps Nine Men Phi Beta Kappa Extends Bids Selections Announced By Faculty Adams, Herring, Hill, Reinhardt, McKnight,
Street, Vowles, Wicker Are Bid

Eight members of the senior class are the recipients of bids to Phi Beta Kappa, national scholarship fraternity, it was
announced by faculty members of that honorary society last week. Those eight men are: Cooper Adams, Petersburg, Tenn.; Dallas Herring,
Rose Hill; Haywood Hill, Richmond, Va.; Pete McKnight, Shelby; James Reinhardt, Lincolnton; Watson Street, Talladega, Ala.; Dick Vowles, Davidson; and
Monroe Wicker, Charlotte.

These men are the first nine in the scholastic rating of the senior class. Those that have obtained grades “summa
cum laude” are: Street, Vowles, Hill, and Adams.

The averages for these eight men for three years’ work are as follows: Watson Street, 3.150; Dick Vowles, 3.066; Haywood
Hill, 3.043; Pete McKnight, 3.030; James Reinhardt, 3.018; Dallas Herring, 2.983; Cooper Adams, 2.978; and Monroe Wicker, 2.940.

However, these averages are not the same as those upon which the actual Phi Beta Kappa elections were based. These
men were chosen according to the use of the new Phi Beta Kappa grading system as explained in last week's
Davidsonian.

Phi Beta Kappa, it is generally known, is the largest and best-known of the national scholastic fraternities. On Davidson campus,
it rates second only to Omicron Delta Kappa in the estimation of the student body. Officers in Phi Beta Kappa
this year are: Dr. W. L. Wiley, president; Dr. P. H. Gwynn, Jr., vice-president; and Dr. W. P. Cumming, secretary-treasurer.

Maestro Earl Mellen, suave orchestra leader, will return to the Davidson campus next week to play for the Homecoming dances,
on November 5 and 6, at the Charlotte Armory Auditorium.

Homecoming Dances Feature “Melodies By Mellen”

Karl Mellen and his “Melodies by Mellen” orchestra will hold sway at the set of dances, sponsored by the Pan-Hellenic
Council. They will play for one tea dance, and two at night.

Mellen’s orchestra, giving a program of smooth dance music, returned to the air, after an absence of several months, over
station WMBG in Richmond, Va. The Richmond Times-Dispatch describes the orchestra thus: “Led by Earl Mellen, who also faces the
mike for the vocals, the band is composed of 12 musicians, average age 23. Their arrangements of current hit tunes
feature trumpet rides, trombone solos, piano breaks and a Lombardo-like sax section.”

Makes Second Visit

Melodies by Mellen seems to be very popular at southern schools, having played at no less than nine.

Seniors Hold Class Smoker

Tonight at 9 o'clock in the Banquet Hall of Chambers the senior class will be entertained with a smoker. This
will be the first time this year that the class has met together and the meeting will combine social pleasure
with business. At this time Wade Barrow, President of the Class, will appoint various committees, those for senior blazers, caps
and gowns, class gifts, and a few others. These committees will meet and discuss their ideas, presenting them to the
class in the near future. The class gift for last year’s senior class was the furnishing of a room in
the new Infirmary, and it is expected that something equally as beneficial will be chosen by the class of '38.

Chubby King and his band, the original one which played all summer at Mayview Manor, will furnish the entertainment for
a full hour. During the course of the evening light refreshments will be served, along with cigars and cigarettes. Officers
of the Senior Class are: Wade Barrow, President; Hector McGeachy, Vice-President; and Billy Battle Crooks, Secretary-Treasurer.

Glee Club to Present New College Song

New Alma Mater Called “The Red and Black,” Written By Scott, ’37

Prof. J. C. Pfohl announced that Thursday morning at the chapel hour the Davidson College Glee Club would introduce the
new Alma Mater, "The Red and Black." The music for the hymn was written by Kenneth M. Scott, of the
class of '37, and the words were supplied by Dr. and Mrs. W. P. Cumming. It was originally written for
the Centennial Pageant that was to have taken place last year, but upon abandonment of the pageant, the introduction has
been delayed until the present time.

Loyalty Song

In commenting further, Professor Pfohl stated that the Red and Black is a hymn designed to serve and revere the
traditions of Davidson College, as its Alma Mater. It is not to replace “O’ Davidson” in any way, he emphatically
stated. The present tune, written by B. E. Shields, ’20, and E. H. Hamilton ‘17, is to continue in its
proposed capacity as a fight song. The new song is in the form of a loyalty song for its loyalty,
and traditions. We bind to honor those before us and to maintain Davidson's high standards of character, reverence, and ourselves.

Registrars to Hold Meeting

The fourteenth annual meeting of the North Carolina Registrars Association will be held, November 3, at the O. Henry Hotel
in Greensboro, N. C., in conjunction with the meeting of the North Carolina College Conference. Officers for the year 1936-37
are: President, Mr. F. W. Hengeveld, Davidson College; Vice-President, Mr. Ben Husbands, University of North Carolina; Secretary and Treasurer, Miss
Hazel Morrison, Flora McDonald College.

The program will be arranged so the members can attend the College Conference, which begins at three o'clock. First on
the program is the registration of members and visitors, followed by the minutes and report of the Treasurer. Among the
talks will be one by Dr. P. H. Gwynn of Davidson.

Announce Deadline

The Pan-Hellenic Council has set November 15 as the deadline on Midwinter tickets to be purchased under the installment plan.
All students who have not paid for the first two months by that date will be dropped from the list.
After the fifteenth of the month, the prices on the tickets will advance enough to make up for the difference
in the advance sale and the orchestra.

Large Issues

The Davidsonian after this week contains 8 pages. This is the first time in the history of this newspaper that
the staff has run eight pages for two successive editions. The large edition this week is due principally to ODK
and PBK tap days, and is made possible by the diligent work of the business staff in increasing the amount
of advertising space.

Next week the occasion of the added two pages will be the homecoming issue, which will feature many pictures along
with several articles of interest to students and alumni.

Band Presents First Recital

Mr. Bernard Hirsch of Marion Will Appear as Saxophone Soloist

The Davidson College Band will present its first concert of this season on November 5, at eight o'clock in the
Chambers Auditorium. As their guest, Director Pfohl has announced that Mr. Bernard Hirsch, Director of the Marion High School Band,
of Marion, N.C., will appear as soloist of the evening and play one of his own arrangements for saxophones.

It will be at an intermission so as not to interfere with the dances in Charlotte in any way. A
large crowd of alumni is expected to attend. This concert is being given in an effort to raise enough money
to finance the band on its trip to Harvard.

Trip

The trip to Harvard will be the onlyTrip of stance taken by the band this year. Although all the necessary
funds have not been obtained, it seems highly probable (Continued on Page Eight).

Plan, Seniors From Winthrop Are To Be Guests
College Will Entertain Bevy Of Girls at Furman Game Saturday

Due to the extreme popularity of the Davidson-Queens Day, which was held here last spring, the college has decided to
sponsor a similar event this year. The student body, acting as hosts to the Winthrop College senior class, will entertain
them here on Saturday at the Davidson-Furman game.

According to Wade Barrow, head of the committee in charge of the arrangements, accommodations for 200 girls have been made,
and free tickets to the game will be given. A section in the stands will also be reserved for the
occasion.

Date Bureaus Function

Barrow stated that the girls will arrive on the campus about 1:30 o'clock and will go to “date bureaus” and
meet the boys that they are scheduled to have dates with. After this, they will march to the football field
and see the classic, after which, probably, a reception will be held. The girls will leave the campus about six
o'clock.

Barrow also stated that the names of the girls will be available on Wednesday night, and that boys desiring dates
would sign up. Their names will be put opposite the name of the girl who is to be their date.
The committee of arrangements, which is in charge, consists of Wade Barrow, chairman, George Matthis, Billy Crooks, Bobby Arrowsmith, and
Ray Pittman. Miss Jean McLaurin, president of the senior class of Winthrop College, has charge of the arrangements at Winthrop.
Barrow stated that Fred Smith, alumni secretary, is helping with the arrangement of the occasion. This event will not take
the place of the annual Davidson-Queens Day, though if proven successful, it will also become an annual affair.

Relief Report

A letter, according to F. L. Jackson, president of the Davidson Relief Committee, has been sent out to the Co-operating
Unit of the Davidson Relief Committee, in regards to the Community Chest Campaign here. This letter is in the form
of a report on the work going on in an effort to see that none of the needy citizens of
Davidson should suffer for the necessities of life, and to discourage door-to-door solicitation. Mr. Jackson stated that about $1,000 is
needed to carry out this work for the next twelve months, and that every case is thoroughly investigated before the
help is given.

Play to Be Presented by Masquers

As their first play of the 1937-38 session, the Red and Black Masquers have decided upon a successful comedy of
a few years past, “The Bishop Misbehaves.” This play was scheduled for last spring, but due to the Centennial Pageant
had to be postponed. The cast has already been selected, and rehearsals started as of October. The performance will probably
be presented about the middle of November, however, no definite date can be determined.

Plenty of Action

The play is a three-act comedy dealing with the activities of the Bishop of Broadminster, a saintly man who takes
a holiday and turns amateur detective. A storm forces the Bishop and his sister, Lady Emily Lyons, to seek refuge
in a disreputable “pub” a few hours after a jewel robbery. There the Bishop, an avid mystery fan, finds his
detective instincts aroused, and in his spare time, manages to discover the loot that the thieves will follow him for.
Knowing the stolen jewels, the Bishop leaves his calling card and carries away the jewels. After carefully hiding his treasure
in the nearest humidor, the Bishop calmly awaits the three villains who soon arrive. They seem to have the good
Bishop at their mercy until by clever strategy he secures the “hero's” gun and mastery of the situation. Several times
it appears that the thieves will turn the tables but a little timely gun-play on the Bishop's part saves the
day. Investigation vindicates the hero and heroine, who were merely trying to regain their rights, and they are awarded His
Grace's blessing.

The cast of the play is as follows: the hero, Donald Meadows, played by Wade Barrow; the heroine, Hester Grantham,
played by Miss Gladys Scott; the Bishop, Fitz Dade; Lady Emily Lyons, the Bishop’s sister, Mrs. E. J. Erwin; Mrs.
Waller, Miss Orrie Steele; Guy Waller, Dave Woodward; “Red” Eagan, Warren Gaw; Collins, the chauffeur, Shaw Smith; “Frenchy” James Currie;
Mr. Brooke, the Bishop's secretary, C. K. Malone.

Wade Barrow, popular president of the senior class, presided at the Omicron Delta Kappa “Tap Day” ceremonies in chapel this
morning.

Big Apple Permitted at Dances

Philip Lane Smith, president of Pan-Hellenic Council, definitely settles the question of whether or not there will be any “Big
Apple” at the Homecoming Dances. He announces that the council has voted to ban the “Big Apple” from Davidson dances.
The Council decided that the Little Apple would not disrupt the dances, and therefore will allow that dance. In voting
to abolish the famous South Carolina dance sensation, the council expressed the opinion that it would not be in keeping
with the spirit of the dances, that it would hinder many who do not know how to Big Apple from
enjoying the dance, and that the majority of the student body preferred not having it. By doing away with the
Big Apple, Davidson follows many of the other colleges and universities of the country. Washington and Lee, Duke, the University
of North Carolina, and others have already taken this step.

State is Host to the NCCPA

North Carolina College Association will be the host to the remainder of the week. This meeting will be held in
Raleigh with State College as official host. Headquarters for the meeting will be the Hotel Davy. Many highlights have been
