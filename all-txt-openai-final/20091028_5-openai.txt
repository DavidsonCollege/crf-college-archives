THE DAVIDSONIAN WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 28, 2009 ARTS

“Jelani,” above, by Doug Auld, is one of an exhibit that draws attention to the voyeuristic tendencies of human nature.

Carey Leigh Evans Staff Writer

The exhibition “STARING” is “a visual extension” of Rosemarie Garland-Thompson’s book, *Staring: How We Look* at Davidson College until December 9. This exhibition questions the individual’s idea of the normal and addresses “staring” as an individual’s response to the abnormal. Staring is a consequence of the viewer trying to make something fit into his idea of the norm, to make order and sense out of it. Ultimately, staring is about the choice one makes in how he looks. This exhibition challenges the individual to question how he treats the abnormal, as many of the works give special respect to individuals with physical deformities.

One critique of the exhibition is the inclusion of works that do not force the viewer to confront the individual or group, but merely look at other people staring. This takes away from the directness of the exhibition and its goal to engage the viewer with the images. Most of the works in the exhibition depict physical abnormalities. Doug Auld’s piece, “Jelani,” for example, shows a large black man who at a distance appears to have tattoos all over his body, but upon closer look actually has a severe skin disease. The positioning of the figure and the intensity of his gaze invite the viewer to return his stare. In doing so, the viewer destroys the perceived hierarchy between himself and Jelani and gives respect and value to the individual, rather than dismissing him by looking away.

The inclusion of Chris Rush’s work illustrates another intention of the exhibition—to display dignity through the images. “Gloria,” a young woman appearing to suffer from Down syndrome, is adorned with a red turban, evoking the semiotics of royalty and grandeur in traditional painting. This work, unlike “Jelani,” is not about returning the stare to give respect to the individual. Rather, Rush elevates Gloria over the viewer and subsequently forces the viewer to give her value and importance. Thus, the viewer stares even more intently as he tries to view Gloria as not just disabled but dignified as well.

Works like Eugene W. Smith’s “Untitled” and Jay Jaffee’s “Couple Peering Through the Hole,” on the other hand, display individuals staring at something other than the viewer. With the inclusion of these works and others like them, the exhibit misses the opportunity to surround the viewer with stares and force him into an environment where he must confront the issues at hand. Instead, these pieces offer a respite in the midst of what should present a necessarily uncomfortable situation that challenges the viewer. The pieces attempt to interact with each other and to establish another layer of staring. Though this goal is not clearly obtained, there is evidence of it, and it gives, for the viewer who recognizes it, yet another way to think about “how we look.”Overall, applause is due to Davidson’s Art Department and Dr. Ann Fox for bringing this exhibition to the Belk Visual Arts Center. The investigation into this topic is revolutionary, and the analysis of staring unveils another layer of consciousness and human value.

### Families Enjoy Music, Dance Extravaganza
**Katie Lovett, Staff Writer**

So it is Saturday afternoon, midway through Family Weekend 2009, and you find yourself wondering what to do with the parental units. You’ve already opted to forgo Commons and brave the crowds at either The Egg or Toast in order to fuel yourselves up with some pancakes and French toast. You may have watched the class of 2010 march by in their caps and gowns in Duke Family Performance Hall during Fall Convocation, before checking out this year’s line-up at the basketball scrimmage. The tasty snacks served at the International Festival have all been eaten, and the students manning their cultural displays have disappeared. And, unfortunately, the Drake Bulldogs have already beaten us in football 21 to 16. 

So, with the family starting to wonder what was next on the agenda, the Music and Dance Extravaganza was sure to entertain. Besides, anything with the word “extravaganza” in its name would definitely satisfy the antsy younger siblings. The 2009 Music and Dance Extravaganza, featuring performances from the Generals, the Delilahs, and Androgyny, as well as Dance Ensemble and Davidson’s step team, Shades of Brown, provided an hour of entertainment for many Davidson students and their families last Saturday afternoon. 

After morning downpours and an iffy-looking sky moved the performance from Chambers Lawn to its rain location in the Brown Atrium, students and parents alike filled all levels of the Alvarez College Union, leaning over the railings to catch a glimpse of the performance. Other students that had hunkered down with the intention of knocking out some homework could be seen abandoning their earphones and textbooks to watch the show.

The Delilahs opened with their catchy rendition of Alesha Dixon’s “The Boy Does Nothing.” Gretta Mae Ferguson ’12 sang the lead part. After “So Happy Together” and the Dixie Chicks’ “Goodbye Earl,” Davidson’s step team, Shades of Brown, took the stage to perform two routines. In one routine, the dancers wore blindfolds, which earned them enthusiastic applause from the audience. Davidson’s co-ed a cappella group, Androgyny, followed Shades of Brown, with Pat Morgan ’12 leading the group in LFO’s “Every Other Time.”

Dance Ensemble, Davidson’s largest student-run organization, also contributed a few routines to the Music and Dance Extravaganza. Their appearance provided an enticing advertisement for their upcoming shows on November 7 and 8. Dressed in all grey and black, the Gamut Dance Company showcased a routine to Bon Iver’s “The Wolves” before handing the stage over to a sari-filled Bhangra performance. The afternoon concluded with three songs from the Generals, including The Lion King’s “Can You Feel the Love Tonight?” and Dispatch’s “The General.”

Overall, the Music and Dance Extravaganza provided a great activity for families to fit into their weekend at Davidson. One parent of a sophomore remarked, “There were a great variety of performing arts and athletic events available this weekend. There was certainly something for everyone.”
