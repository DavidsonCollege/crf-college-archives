**Opinions: A Personal Definition of American Capitalism**
**David Williams**

Upon observing the incredible amount of poverty, crime, filth, and “immorality” in many modern American black communities, a large percentage of whites, even those who call themselves “Christians,” tend to look down upon these black communities as “a bunch of lazy, stupid, inferior niggers” who consume all the taxpayers’ hard-earned money. Having formed these racist attitudes, many whites have removed themselves from interaction with the black community by living in the suburbs, attending all-white churches, and even sending their children to all-white private schools. This racism, coupled with segregation, has caused a solid rift to form between black and white, and now hostilities and inequalities abound between the races. As a result, much of the black community continues to remain poor, oppressed, and underprivileged, and without hope—unable to stand on its own feet without the opportunities that a majority of whites have. But if the more affluent can work to help the poor black community, it can finally stand on its own two feet. Then these horrible problems of poverty, crime, filth, and “immorality” can be overcome once and for all!

Now many affluent whites tend to ask the following question: “Why must I help out the black race? It was my ancestors, and not I, who enslaved them. We gave them their freedom from slavery in the 1860s. If they only work hard like I have, the black race can easily rise on its own two feet by itself. They must help themselves in order to rise from poverty. That’s what American capitalism is all about.” Yet a few observations of early American black history will explain to anyone why the black community needs the more privileged whites to help them. It has been a tradition of oppression for hundreds of years that has placed the black race in its subservient level of existence.

The American black community is the only large group of people who originally immigrated to America against their will. From the late seventeenth century to the early nineteenth century, large groups of Africans were removed from their native nations and shipped across the ocean to be sold at auction to American bidders. Unlike other immigrants who poured into America, the early black Americans were provided with virtually no rights of property ownership, education, free speech, or having a family. Yes, that’s right, a majority of black Americans, once enslaved, were refused the right of having a family. This was one in a series of steps taken by the American slaveowner to attempt to destroy the black man’s last possession—his identity. Husbands were separated from wives, children were taken from their parents, and even breeding camps were developed. It was cheaper for the slaveowner to acquire new slaves by mass breeding them than by going to auction.

The white man attempted to destroy the culture of the black race in several other ways. Unlike immigrating Germans, Irish, or Dutch, the African man was renamed “negro” or “nigger” in order to separate him from identity with his native land. The slaveowner Christianized the slave in order to destroy his native religion and to instill in him values of subservience with Bible verses such as “Slaves, obey your masters.” Finally, the white man crushed the black man’s sense of power by removing him from any and all economic, political, and organizational opportunities. So spiritually, socially, economically, politically, and culturally the black man was oppressed before he was freed from slavery in the mid-1860s. With the thirteenth through fifteenth amendments, the slaves were “freed,” made “citizens of the United States,” and were “allowed the right to vote.” But these amendments have not done the job that they claim to do. Even to this day, blacks are oppressed in most of the ways they were oppressed prior to slavery.

How can I say this? Well, a few simple facts will explain how. From 1865 to 1877, the Southern black community was given a substantial amount of political power. But the Southern whites found ways to oppress their fellow black citizens by instituting various laws which would ensure that blacks would not be given the right to vote nor to hold office despite what the constitution said, and by the 1890s, blacks lost most of their political rights. Still today, they are fighting to regain their lost political influence.

In the workplace, blacks have continually been discriminated against. After slavery, the black community had no ownership of the means of production and has been dependent ever since on the white man to give him work. But the white man has not allowed the black man to obtain the jobs he needs to rise from his poverty and stand on his own two feet. Rarely today does one find a black-owned company, because the black race has rarely been allowed to have more than menial work. Therefore, many blacks have had to depend on welfare as their only source of income. Welfare has crippled the black community by making it dependent on the government and unable to stand on its own feet. In his book *With Justice For All*, John Perkins says, “Designed to assist when there was no father, the welfare system stepped in and replaced the father. It eliminated the need for families to take economic initiative. It rewarded mothers if the husbands did not come back, and penalized them if they did.” The welfare state in America has caused traditional family values to be eroded, and yet the family lies at the core of American society!

In education and social relations, the black man again has been oppressed. Not until the 1970s did many schools of our nation begin to be desegregated, and even when they were, many new all-white private schools were created in order to continue the tradition of segregation. As a result, the majority of black people have received an inferior education. Many blacks have not learned through solid education the importance of the family in the development of human beings, and as a result, more than 50 percent have single-parent households.

When no solid economic, social, or moral tradition exists among a group of people, and no one helps that community build a strong tradition, that group feels oppressed and without hope. As a result, poverty, crime, and “immorality” can easily become problematic. If true to American standards, affluent whites must work to establish a sense of hope, security, and economic strength among the black community.the oppressed black community. Yet, how can we work to accomplish that goal? I believe that Perkins, founder of Mendenhall Ministries in Mendenhall, Mississippi, and Voice of Calvary Ministries in Jackson, Mississippi, has presented the most viable plan of action. He calls his plan a “Quiet Revolution,” which takes the form of a holistic ministry to the poor black communities across America. In his concept of ministry, Perkins emphasizes the “three R’s” as his strategy for fulfilling the critical needs of the black community in America. The three concepts include relocation, redistribution, and reconciliation through Christ. Not only the spiritual needs, but also the social (family), and economic needs of the poor community are addressed.

First, Perkins believes it is the job of affluent persons to relocate themselves into the black community. Christ had a special place for the poor in his ministries, and through Christ, we are called also to make within ourselves a special place for the poor and oppressed. If we only travel to the poor, without actually living among them, we do not face their problems. If we minister to them during the day and then return to our comfortable, luxurious homes to live by night, we cannot really relate to those who do not have what we have. But by relocating within the poor community, the needs of the poor become our needs, and we can begin not only to observe but also to understand the real problems that the poor community faces. By living among the poor, we can identify with the poor community and begin to work through them to help solve their problems.

Second, Perkins emphasizes reconciliation between white and black through Christ. As Perkins says, “Love is stronger than hate.” Having arrived at the Brandon, Mississippi jail to post bond for some friends wrongly jailed in the civil rights movement, Perkins was suddenly ambushed by a dozen or so white Brandon police officers, who nearly beat Perkins and his friends to death. Lying bloody on the jailhouse floor, Perkins realized for the first time that those white policemen were victims of their own racism and that he simply couldn’t hate them back for what they had done. He realized the importance of black and white living in love and harmony, not hatred and conflict. And so, he emphasizes racial reconciliation through Christ. The races must “bear the burden” of their pasts; the white man must absorb the black man’s feeling of oppression and inferiority, while the black man must absorb the white man’s feeling of guilt and superiority in order to be reconciled through Christ. And being reconciled to others first implies reconciliation to God. We must all work to rid ourselves of hatred, feelings of hostility, and antagonism towards the other race, then work to bring unity to all people in the name of Christ. One important means of racial reconciliation through Christ is the desegregation of Churches. Eleven a.m. Sunday morning is the most segregated hour in America—a solid contradiction to the ideals of unity among Christians.

Finally, Perkins emphasizes redistribution. In the concept of holistic ministry, the term “redistribution” absolutely does not imply redistribution of wealth from rich to poor. Even if all the wealth of the rich were transferred to the poor, the rich would have all that money back within two weeks. The majority of poor would go out and buy what Perkins calls “the empty symbols of success:” Cadillacs, fur coats, and whiskey. The poor do not own the means of production, and many do not understand the concept of saving income and building up wealth; rather, any income to them is only a means of immediate acquisition of goods. Consequently, they are unable to accumulate wealth. Instead, Perkins calls for the more affluent to go into the poor community and to redistribute their skills, their talents, their opportunities, and their knowledge among the poor. Perkins says, “In America today, one group has the capital, the other has the labor and the broken spirit.” In order to make free enterprise work for all, he advocates the establishment of cooperatives and credit unions in poor communities. Influential people can work to help establish them. We constantly hear about hunger among the poor, but hunger does not stem from a lack of food production. Rather, people go hungry because they have no employment which provides wages to buy food. If we can work to employ the poor and not just transfer money to them, their pride and economic standing will increase greatly; thus all of society will benefit.

Perkins has established model holistic ministries in Mendenhall and Jackson, Mississippi, and in each of these ministries, his plan for racial reconciliation, relocation, and redistribution is being carried out. I was fortunate to work with four other Davidson students in the Jackson ministry, Voice of Calvary, over spring break. There I was really able to view, sometimes with disbelief, the horrible plight of the poor black community in this area. Yet the ministry there is working hard to quietly change the situation of the black community in that area by ministering to their social, economic, and spiritual needs. The ministry has created a new non-denominational interracial church in which blacks and whites can come together to worship as a union of God's people. The ministry has set up a model cooperative in which the people of the community have a part in the store's business and has given blacks employment and leadership opportunities. Through People’s Development, Inc., the ministry works to restore old houses and sell them at low cost, in order that the people of the community can own their own homes and have a sense of belonging. Through its health ministry, it provides low-cost medical care to the poor. And through its youth ministry, Voice of Calvary is working to build future leaders in the black community. Each specific ministry is run by local blacks and is supported by a large number of whites who relocate into the predominantly black neighborhood.

John Perkins has ignited the fire, and the two Mississippi holistic ministries are working to kindle it. But they cannot perform the job alone. I urge everyone who feels that our Constitution, our Christian heritage, and even our Pledge of Allegiance mean “justice for all,” to consider the words of John Perkins. Perkins has been nearly beaten to death by whites for his beliefs, but he hates no one. He calls for a “Quiet Revolution”—for a peaceful reconciliation of all of God's children through Christ.
