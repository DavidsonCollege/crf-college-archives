12 THE DAVIDSONIAN

#### TRUMBO’S PICKS OF THE WEEK

**Wildcat Game of the Week**
Davidson vs No. 7 Wofford/No. 10 App. State, Friday, 10:00

Having just finished the season 8-2 in the conference and 18-5 overall, the women’s tennis team is poised to make a SoCon title run, starting with a quarter-finals match on Friday versus the winner of No. 7 Wofford and No. 10 App. State. The team will be seeded second for the tournament, which runs from 4/22-4/24.

**Outside the Den**
Cleveland Cavaliers vs. Toronto Raptors, Wednesday, 7:00

Can Lebron carry the Cavs to the playoffs in year two, or will the summer? Ironically, Vince’s old team could also be the one that keeps his new team, the Nets, at home over the summer. New Jersey still owns the tie-breaker over Cleveland, but if the Cavs beat Toronto and New Jersey loses Wednesday night, Raptors fans might get their vindication for an athlete that admitted to dogging it back in Toronto.

I love that Davidson believes it is still possible to maintain top-flight sports while at the same time holding athletes to the same academic standards as the other 75 percent of its students. I respect how we don’t hold slots for kids, how we link athletic scholarships to academic achievement, and that more than 90 percent of our athletes graduate from this place with a degree. But that is not good enough.

It is admirable and remarkable that we have maintained competition in 21 varsity sports, and most of those teams are at least competitive on an annual basis. To give you perspective, even our regional rival Wake Forest, a 4,000-student university in the ACC, fields just 18 varsity sports. Furman, meanwhile, has 16 sports, and Wofford supports 17. That Davidson can be successful on so many different fields is something that our school can, and should, be proud of.

Unfortunately, the most important number for some teams is at the bottom of the budget, not the win column. For a school of 1,700 students, and a relatively small endowment, we just cannot effectively balance that many strong teams. In track, for example, we give a small fraction of the maximum NCAA scholarship allotment, and we don’t even have a pole vault pit or a hammer cage because of their potential costs. Therefore, we can’t enter athletes in those events in a meet, including the conference championships.

Overall, in men’s sports, Davidson provides less than one fifth of the total allowable grants under NCAA regulations. In women’s sports, meanwhile, Davidson offers less than one third of the maximum. Unfortunately, the money just isn’t there to provide adequate funding to all of our teams, and it is unlikely that will change much in the future. Even if it does, that support will likely go to our flagship programs, such as soccer, basketball, and football, as it typically has in the past. While track still waits for a pole vault pit, the football stands have been overhauled, complete with a new weight-room facility, the baseball stands have been redone, and a brand-new soccer stadium has been built.

In theory, it is fine to allow this situation to continue, as Davidson does still provide a chance for more than 400 athletes to compete in sports they love. But in my opinion, it is unfair to allow our athletes to lace it up when we don’t reciprocate the support they so willfully provide the College. We can’t send athletes on the field without a chance to win. As a result, there are only two feasible ways to increase competitiveness while minimizing the stress on the athletic budget.

Many administrators and faculty have long pushed to move Davidson to the Division III level, which they believe would be more in line with the true academic goals of this university. That move would dramatically reduce the athletic budget and allow Davidson to spend more money on faculty, merit scholarships, and financial aid, but I believe Division I athletics still add a great deal to this place. As men’s basketball coach Bob McKillop says, “Division I athletics at Davidson provide a window into the college in a very positive way. That’s an extraordinary statement about our school, and it provides the college with a very selective student.”

Thus, the only other potential solution to our overcrowded landscape is to reduce the number of sports.we offer. This move would be a drastic and painful one, and certainly not something that could happen in the immediate future. Just as I feel we need to provide better support for all of our athletes in the future, we cannot abandon the ones that are already here. Still, it is a harsh reality that every year, teams across the country have been forced to cut programs to ease the ever-growing budget woes in athletic programs. Just this past year, for example, former SoCon member ETSU cut its football program, forcing the school to leave the conference altogether. Despite the consequences, the school saw that move as the only way to make competition in other sports feasible. Now, just imagine what our men’s soccer program, which has finished in the top 40 nationally the past two seasons, could do with equal funding. Wouldn’t you love to see what women’s soccer coach Greg Ashton or women’s basketball coach Annette Watts could do with more scholarship money? By cutting back and focusing on a smaller number of sports, Davidson could offer more competitive teams across the board. Then, we could give just as much commitment to the players as they currently give to us.

So, March Madness is over, and suddenly everyone’s interest jumps to Major League Baseball. (Because who really cares about the NBA playoffs, right?) But don’t overlook that other college sport, which is baseball in case you were wondering. To give you an idea of how little respect college baseball gets, ESPN has a homepage for poker but not college baseball. In addition, the MLB draft is before college players end their season. So what’s with the lack of love? Baseball guru Sean Wentworth ’05 would say sternly, “Because nobody cares.” Well, I’m going to tell you that people should care.

I grew up on Tulane baseball and have not found too many experiences greater than following them through a three-game series against LSU to reach their first College World Series in 2001. My dad, whose blind love for Tulane sports rivals that of any loyal fan, had purchased tickets to the entire Conference-USA tournament that year, so we parked ourselves in the right field bleachers of Turchin Stadium for the weekend to enjoy each and every game. Dad went through thirty-six “one in four win” Diet Cokes while winning only twice. That memory brings me to reason number one to love college baseball: it’s got that cozy, local ballpark feel.

So we watched game after game with all kinds of craziness. Balks, wild pitches, grand slams, stolen bases, and incredible catches; all those nuances of the game became a reality time and time again. Reason number two to love college baseball: it’s not perfect. These guys make mistakes, which make the game even more fun to watch.

Tulane made it through the CUSA tourney and won its Regional sectional that year to advance to play LSU in the Super Regionals. It just so happened that Tulane was granted the home regional over college baseball powerhouse LSU at Zephyr Field, “The Shrine on Airline” for you Kenner lovers. It’s no surprise that people in Louisiana were more excited about this match-up than the Super Bowl, as LSU fans rolled into New Orleans with their trailers and tail-gating supplies, while Tulane fans appeared in their tucked-in collared shirts ready for a sophisticated duel.

Hopefully, it’s obvious from my description that Tulane and LSU fans neither understand nor like each other. That utter hatred, though, provides some of the most fun games you will ever be a part of, which brings me to reason number three to love college baseball: you’ll enjoy some of the most emotional regional match-ups of your life—without having to wait for “interleague play.” Tulane, by the way, went on to beat LSU in three games (now that’s a heckuva Hullabaloo), but then won only one game in three attempts in Omaha. Still, Tulane is back in the top rankings this year and even ranked first in a few polls. That fact brings me to reason number four: we’re talking about Tulane. I mean, who knows Tulane for athletics, anyway? College baseball is a sport where unusual schools can perform at high levels: Rice and Cal-State Fullerton, to name a few, have been extremely successful on the diamond.

So give college baseball a chance. There’s no better way to spend your May and June, and you’ll get used to that “ping” awfully quickly.
