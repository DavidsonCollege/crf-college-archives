**DAVIDSONIAN OPINIONS**

**In Defense of Fraternities and Sororities (Eating Houses)**

When I was home over Christmas, a dinner guest and I, after debating the usual topics, started discussing fraternities and sororities. Surprisingly, this argument became much more heated than even our exchange about Dan Quayle. It is not altogether shocking that there are many who oppose the notion of fraternities and sororities. However, the bitterness and suppressed anger that surfaces when these organizations are discussed caught me off guard.

“Fraternities and sororities are ‘elitist,’” she thought. “They prevent one from concentrating on school work. They are for immature alcoholics who require ready-made friends. They fly in the face of the mission of education: exposure to new things.” It went on and on.

Finally, I asked her why her company became a company, and not just an informal group of people working together. She replied that the benefits of becoming a formal business are many. I agreed and asked why it is different for a sorority. A group of girls who are friends cannot possibly do as much as a group of girls who are friends and an organization. Service projects, trips, events, and activities are all funded through dues people pay to their fraternal organizations. Do you think I would be in a composite picture with many of my friends if we were not in an organization? Would we go on...

**In Black and White...**

**Malcolm X: the Early Years**

By Scott Windham and Deidra Montague

This week we continue our discussion of Malcolm X, from his childhood to his early years in the Nation of Islam.

Malcolm Little was born in Omaha in 1925. His father, a Christian minister, spoke openly for black concerns and as a result was killed—likely by the Klan—when Malcolm was very young. His mother, under severe stress to keep the family going, slowly lost control and was committed to a mental institution. Living with a kind, white foster family, who despite his brilliance never considered him talented, Malcolm did extremely well in school until a pivotal meeting with one of his teachers.

Expressing his desire to become a lawyer, Malcolm was told that, since he was black, he should aspire at most to become a woodworker. Malcolm slowly entered into a life of crime, spending ten years of his young life hustling in the streets of Boston and New York, using drugs and robbing homes, for which he was eventually arrested. It was in jail that he rid himself of drugs, developed his mind in the prison library and his speaking skills in prison debates. Letters from his Muslim brother and from Elijah Muhammed, the leader of the Nation, introduced Malcolm to Islam. Upon his release from jail, Malcolm joined the Nation of Islam, and, following the custom of the Nation, dropped the name Little in favor of an X. The X represented the African name Malcolm never knew; he rejected the name Little because it was given to his family by white slaveowners.

Malcolm X’s notoriety spread as he rose in influence within the Nation of Islam, becoming more and more closely tied to Elijah Muhammed and helping to spread the Nation all across the United States. Malcolm, who considered Elijah Muhammed his savior, was extremely dedicated to him and his beliefs, not only accepting but developing the ideas promoted by the Nation of Islam. These beliefs sparked fear among white America, who saw them as reverse racism, anarchy, and advocacy of violence. The fear of the majority of whites in the United States was understandable, but misguided. They saw only the side of Malcolm X that the media was willing to portray, such as his hasty statement—which he later regretted—that he was happy to hear of the fatal crash in Paris of a large plane full of whites.

Malcolm was not so much anti-white as pro-black, though he thought that white people were the root of most problems facing black America. He was the first to promote the theory that white oppression of blacks in the United States was only a small part of worldwide oppression by whites of dark-skinned peoples, giving examples such as India, Africa, and South America. Social and economic withdrawal from society were indispensable to help blacks advance. Malcolm X insisted that whites had taken everything from blacks—their home, their name, their language, and their pride. Though he didn’t necessarily advocate violence, he believed in the betterment of the black race, through any means necessary to reclaim those things stolen from blacks.

An interesting parallel to this mindset is that of the first European colonists to America. Surrounded by people of another race, these colonists felt isolated and afraid, and were willing to undertake whatever measures were necessary—including violence—to survive. One of the first in the black nationalist movement to demand that whites respect blacks and blacks respect themselves, Malcolm X insisted on the need for blacks to receive not only civil rights, which affect only the law, but human rights as well, which affect attitudes. The counterpart of this call was his disrespect of whites, which eventually grew into hatred. Drawing from his experiences as a young boy and his inside look at the life of poor urban blacks, Malcolm began calling the white man a blue-eyed devil, inherently evil and responsible for the misery of...Native Americans and blacks in the United States and other races abroad. Would we make t-shirts to remember our parties? Would we develop new traditions and carry on old ones? It is terrific to see a “Rusk 15th Anniversary” shirt and know that our present Ruskies accepted and will pass on the torch of sisterhood. How proud one must have been to be a member of the first Connor class. It is tremendously exciting to read the history of Pi Kappa Alpha because we are part of it. We develop friends across the country, we have common ground with alumni, we have responsibilities to the Pikes of the past, and we have something that will follow us through life. It is financially and historically clear that being official organizations makes fraternities and sororities special. Are fraternities “elitist?” Not by nature. Some adopt a negative attitude towards other people, yet that is not caused by the fraternity. Friendship is natural, and is based on shared experiences. I’m as likely to be friends with the girl who muddled through Economics with me as I am to be friends with my fraternity brothers. If fraternities are so elitist, why do I know so many people? Fraternities and eating houses provide continuity at a large school and increased opportunities at a small one. The tradition and sense of place a fraternity provides is invaluable as one attempts to negotiate the obstacle course that is college.

Moore Expresses Surprise at Accusations

Moore continued from page 5

Regardless of color, if I do not recognize the person I will check their identification. I’m sure that some of you are very aware of this practice. I admit it can be annoying, but it’s done in the better interest of the Davidson College Community from a loss prevention perspective. It is unfortunate that this particular incident was made to appear racially motivated. I can candidly say that I am in no way prejudiced toward blacks, nor am I biased in any of my actions. You see, I am also African-American; I am also a small part of a small percentage at Davidson. I am proud of my race, my culture, and the continuing strides that we make for advancement. I never let race, sex, religion, or anything else that can be viewed as discriminatory, interfere with my making sound, just, and timely decisions. I have worked here on the campus as a Public Safety Officer for a little over a year now and this is the first time that I have had to deal with accusations concerning prejudice or bias. This situation is ironic because I figured that if anyone was accused of such actions, they would probably be white, not black. I must admit, even though I know that it is necessary, I have my apprehensions about checking the ID of any person whom I think could possibly be a student or otherwise affiliated with the college. I feel confident that this incident will not affect me while performing my duties as I have in the past, yet it has awakened me to certain realities. One thought that I would like to leave you with is that certain people have responded very negatively toward this department since the reporting of this incident, stating that the fact that it was an African-American officer involved in the incident had no bearing on the fact that they believed the incident to be racially motivated. It seems that many people feel that police officers stereotype blacks as thieves, rapists, drug dealers, etc. I must admit that the crime rate among blacks on a national basis is very high right now, but this fact would not make it right for police officers to stereotype all blacks as potential criminals. Nor is it right for anyone to stereotype all police officers as being biased.

Sincerely,
Officer S.T. Moore

College police have top priority of keeping campus safe

DCPD continued from page 5

92.7% of persons arrested were white. We would like to assure all students that the first priority of all of our campus police officers is your safety and well-being. It is without doubt that some of you will be approached by someone in this department and asked to produce some form of ID, so please understand that this is done in your best interest and without prejudice. Our door is always open to anyone wishing to address concerns of our policies or actions taken by this department. In conclusion, the only absolute solution to this problem would be to prohibit the officers from questioning the identity of anyone on campus. Unfortunately, a policy of this nature would not be consistent with the safety and well-being of the college community. We will, nevertheless, do all we can to eliminate even the perception of prejudice.

Sincerely,
Davidson College Police Department
