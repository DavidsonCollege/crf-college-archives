**Trustee interview: Should we pay attention to the students?**

**Lucia Kendall**

The Davidsonian was recently granted a special interview with three members of Davidson’s Board of Trustees: Mr. Wallace S. Fuddydudi,
Mr. Alistair Brooks, and Mr. James Crowe. The rest of the trustees were unable to attend the interview session because
they were out to lunch.

**Davidsonian:** Some students believe that too much of the decision-making power is in the hands of those who are least
in touch with the school, and that those who know Davidson the best, namely the students and the professors, are
ignored. How do you feel about these comments?

**Fuddydudi:** What? Are you talking to me?

**Davidsonian:** I was talking about students being ignored.

**Fuddydudi:** Did somebody in here say something?

**Crowe:** Well, it just seems preposterous to me that we should listen to students' ideas on important decisions. They don’t
know what they’re talking about. Next thing you know they’ll want to admit women and black students into the college.

**Davidsonian:** Sir, we already have...

**Crowe:** Personally, I think it’s too much to even have the students bring dates to class with them. And I
see all these young black janitors sitting in on classes when they should be sweeping or mopping or something.

**Davidsonian:** Excuse me, but 40% of the students Davidson admits are women, and on the average, they have better SAT
scores and high school grades than the male applicants who are admitted.

**Crowe:** Yes, but we must never forget that Davidson has a great tradition of recognizing the natural supremacy of males.
We would never let little details like females being more qualified deter us from keeping a man’s environment at Davidson;
Davidson is for men, first and foremost.

**Brooks:** Well, when I was a student, back in ’78...

**Davidsonian:** You were a student in 1978?

**Brooks:** Not 1978, my dear, 1878. As I was saying, things haven’t changed much since then. You may say I’m
still living in the past, that I have no idea what modern life is, but I’ve learned through experience. I
think students just need something to get upset about, that’s all. It used to be the Civil War, now it’s
lack of influence. That’s really a made-up problem anyway. In fact, most of the problems around here are just made-up.
Just the other day I heard someone talking about drugs; one of his friends was a coke addict. Well, I’ve
been drinking Coca-Cola for years and it never bothered me. And all this fuss about Chlamydia—if it’s such a venerable
disease, then why are they complaining about it?

**Davidsonian:** Sir, I believe the term is “venereal,” not “venerable.”

**Brooks:** Venereal disease? What’s that?

**Davidsonian:** Never mind.

**Brooks:** In any case, I believe it is my God-given duty to perpetuate the status quo.

**Davidsonian:** What do you think of the recent decision to deny tenure to Frank Albinder without telling him the reason
for it?

**Fuddydudi:** How should we know about who the faculty are? People seem to think we’re supposed to keep up with
everything going on around campus.Albinder: Davidsonian: He’s a very good teacher.

Crowe: Is he a W.A.S.P.?

Brooks: I agree with Jimmy that there are a lot of other factors involved in decisions like these. We want
our professors to be... um... cooperative. I’ve heard that if Mr. Albinder doesn’t like something about Davidson, he’s not afraid
to say so. I don’t think that attitude is conducive to Davidson’s environment. This campus is idyllic, and if he
thinks there are any problems here, he’s wrong.

Davidsonian: Doesn’t that kind of thinking abridge his rights of free speech?

Brooks: Please don’t misunderstand me. Anyone at Davidson can feel free to criticize any aspect of Davidson life (as long
as it’s not directed at the important people). We don’t care what they say—we’ll just ignore... uh, I mean take
their views into consideration.

Davidsonian: Your arguments have been extremely convincing. I’m glad Davidson is in the hands of such able leaders. Thank you
for your time.
