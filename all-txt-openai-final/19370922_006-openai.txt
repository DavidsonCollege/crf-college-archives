Page Six THE DAVIDSONIAN WEDNESDAY, SEPT. 22, 1937

What Every College Man Should Know

His wife is boss at home... No complaints about the icebox and the garbage can are particularly resented... Her friends are always welcome, but his friends are on strict probation... If she reads his socks and shirts... If he'll give her the money, she'll show him how to run a house... She breaks even at bridge... She gets the last cent of value for every dollar she spends... She takes credit for the fine things the children do... She blames him for the rest... She chooses the menu with other people in mind besides him... If she doesn't like whipped cream on her pie, you know more or less what to do about it... She can't be intimidated by any man... So make the best of it!

New Men to Assume Professorial Duties

One hundred and twenty new professors have been added. Burney Thomas, ‘10, of Pittsburgh, retiring president of the organization, presided over the meeting. Conrad Frederick Smith, alumni secretary, made his annual report of the year's business. Dr. Henry Louis Smith, former president of Davidson, gave a very witty and enjoyable speech.

Six additions to the college faculty have been made since the last term. F. Ward, Warrenton; S. Erb, Badin; Boyd Flynn, Washington; A. L. Green, Atlanta, Ga.; J. F. Hemphill, Forest City; T. M. Hemphill, Marion; L. C. Hite, Florence, S.C.; Frederick Moore, Jr., Columbia, S.C.; Miguel A. Munoz, San Juan, Puerto Rico; J. F. Niven, Albemarle; E. H. Austin, Jr., Rocky Mount; S. Stearns, Charlotte; J. H. Hogg, Denver, Col.; R. W. Finley, Gainesville, Ga.; A. M. Foote, Jr., Jacksonville, Fl.; G. McGavock, Wilkesboro; and W. F. MacArthur, Charlotte.

Logan Williamson, Sisal, and Eddie Dooley, popular sports commentator, is back on the air. Each Thursday and Saturday he gives football fans the latest gridiron news over a coast-to-coast network. Dooley will broadcast at 6:30 P.M. New York time, for east and middle west sports fans. These Chesterfield programs will include not only forecasts on the lights of the games on Saturdays but also plans to have noted authorities in the football world as guests on his programs.

Excuse us, you older men; we're talking, at the moment, to the freshmen—whom you may or may not have told that there’s a Charlotte headquarters for Davidson men, at KAPPA SIGMA (Delta Chapter). Oh, it’s a quite “unofficial” headquarters. But you'll see most of the student body here, in the course of your visiting, and no small number of alumni, as well as their friends, and their “dates,” as well.ya: : +" pee North Wilkesboro; K. C.
