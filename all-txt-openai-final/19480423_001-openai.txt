**Trials and Tribulations of a Frolicker**

By BOB HOLLISTER

You start two months ahead of time: You write the letter, you mail it, you sit around two weeks with one eye on the post office and the other in a textbook. You tell your friends you don’t know yet, but you’re positive she’ll accept—the other half feeling sorry for yourself, certain that she won’t. Finally, you get the letter, but you know how it is with your hopes. There was a meeting of “The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Frolickers” that she just couldn’t miss and, oh yes, what, she’s just...

(Continued on Page Six)Tampa, Florida, Herb has been with the 7th Division in Europe. He was master of ceremonies. The deadline for the entry of... decide you can't wait any longer. He has been elected grand vice treasurer and calling home. Herb has been active in many phases of campus life since coming to Davidson. He returned with the Purple Heart and resumed his academic work at Davidson. He will then introduce each competing group. Judges will be Mr. Donald Davidson, a Davidson alumnus and editor. 

By then, you're almost through lingering. Nothing left now but buying your ticket, borrowing a car, and meeting your date who is due in during the middle of your Eco review. So, never mind all that—you've got your wire, too, but she thought you were just trying to... 

Herb served with the Marine Corps during the war. He is the son of The Charlotte Observer's managing editor. He was elected first vice president and Paul Horne second vice president. Both are rising seniors—Vandy, the president of the Davidson Chapter, is from Brownsville, Texas, and Horne hails from Hot Springs, North Carolina. Van Hellenic Council, the annual open meeting of the Davidson College Chapter of the Phi Beta Kappa Society, will be held on Friday, April 30 at 8:30 in the evening. The speaker will be President Goodrich C. White of Emory University, a Senator of Phi Beta Kappa. Dr. White will speak on the subject: "Education and the Democratic Ideal." The student body and the general college community are invited to hear Dr. White’s address.

Re-elected to the offices they previously held were Malloy Owen, secretary, and Tom Davis, treasurer. Malloy is from Fayetteville, S.C. In addition to his duties as secretary, he served the club as chairman of the House Committee and was responsible for house facilities. Davis was so efficient at his job of treasurer that the members showed their appreciation by re-election.
