**Mike York Heads Community Work**

By DICK MOREHEAD

What are our obligations, responsibilities, and opportunities of service toward our neighbors as we live in this temporary four-year society
of college life? As Christians, what can we do about the serious and salient problems that exist within our community?
These are the pertinent questions which the Community Work Committee seeks to answer as it serves the neighboring area through
the voluntary efforts of the student body under the Christian leadership of the Y.

The work of this post is directed toward the Negro community of Davidson, especially among older young people and the
adults. Two of the major aims which have been set for this year are: one, to attempt to develop a
better attitude within the student body toward the Negroes, to promote a better understanding of their problems, and in every
possible way, to raise their social standing; and two, to aid them in growing toward a keener social, a more
informed and spiritually sound community. Although these aims seem gigantic in proportion, much has already been done toward their fulfillment.

In accomplishing these goals, Community Work is divided into the relative groups of function and study. The former deals with
the carrying out of these things which seem practical and within the means of the interested Davidson students. Equally as
important, however, is the need of the committee and those interested to study and evaluate the Negro problem as it
exists in our town. The problem of approach seems to be foremost, since response from those served may vary with
the ways in which the work is carried out.

According to Mike York, chairman of the committee, “The air of ‘doing good’ has little value in itself; therefore, consideration
as to what can practically be accomplished is a major part of our post’s work. It seems to be the
chairman's job to lead a study of the situation and to find openings of service for those students interested in
inter-racial work.” Right now investigations of inter-collegiate conferences on these and related subjects are in effect. Some form of general
publicity to be put before the Davidson white community and the college students is being carefully considered and planned, as
it is very probable that the social need right here within five hundred yards of the campus lies unknown to
the majority of the people.

Of particular concern is the “community center” building located a few blocks down from the PO, near the Negro grade
school of Davidson. This building belongs to the Y and is used for social functions and gatherings. Much of the
committee’s work is centered around this building and the school auditorium. This Sunday night a fellowship meeting will be held
at the Negro Presbyterian Church in an attempt to utilize materials and talents available through the Y for the betterment
of the programs of the church. It is hoped that on occasion, students can attend and lead discussions here on
various topics of concern to the community. What this evolves to is the desire for a working relationship between the
student YMCA and the church organizations of the area.

**Discussion Group Sunday Aims At Understanding Many Functions of U.N.**

Davidson students who attended the recent United Nations Seminar in New York will participate in an after-vespers discussion group in
the student lounge of the church this Sunday night. The delegates from Davidson who went to the United Nations seminar
had several purposes in going to this seminar. The central purpose of the seminar was to better understand the United
Nations and to arouse among fellow students the interest and concern of the students in the role of the U.N.
Some of the questions the delegates tried to keep in mind during the conference were: Why the United Nations? How
does it function? Is it accomplishing its aims and making progress toward world peace? How can the American people help
to further its cause? The delegates to this conference plan to try to answer these questions at least in part
and to give to the students and faculty some of their impressions. It is believed that with the critical problem
which the world organization is faced with and the effect these and subsequent decisions can have upon the world, it
behooves the public to be concerned about the United Nations and the relations of the United States to it.

**T. M. Taylor Speaks For Vespers Sunday**

The Reverend Theophilus Mills Taylor will be the Vesper speaker this Sunday, Dec. 6. Mr. Taylor was educated at Muskingum
College, the University of Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh-Xenia Theological Seminary, Yale Divinity School, University of Chicago Divinity School. After serving several pastorates,
Mr. Taylor became the John McNaugher professor of New Testament Literature and Exegesis at Pittsburgh-Xenia Theological Seminary, a position which
he holds at present. Among the many offices Mr. Taylor has held, one of the most recent was that of
the United Presbyterian representative to the Third World Conference on Faith and Order which met in Lund, Sweden. Mr. Taylor
has also edited and helped with numerous religious publications.

**Mike York, chairman of Community Work for YMCA this year, is a senior from Kernersville. While at Davidson, Mike has
distinguished himself in many ways. He is at present treasurer of the Phi Gamma Delta Fraternity, business manager of Scripts
‘n Pranks, president of the International Relations Club, senior representative on the Student Council, and a newly-tapped member of Scabbard
and Blade. Always an active participant in the work of the Y, he served on Y Cabinet last year as
head of all scouting work.**

Persons involved in this work with whom students are familiar are: John Heath, janitor of Georgia dorm; Jack Johnson, local
barber; and various boarding house cooks. They not only aid in actual participation but serve as excellent sources for information
concerning the need and opportunities associated with the work. Fifty members have signed up to work with this important function
of the Y. If any who have not registered with the committee desire to do so, they are urged to
contact Mike York or Sam Magill in the Y office. Regardless of active participation or not, it should be the
personal responsibility of each member of the student body to become aware of the problems and needs of our community,
to realize its opportunities, and to take an active part in its service and life.

**“Y” GIFT FUND GOAL UP $400 FROM 1952**

**NEGRO HUT PROJECT DESCRIBED**

By CHUCK WRIGHT

The YMCA kicked the lid off their 1953 Christmas Gift Fund last night. The goal for this year is set
at $5,000, an increase of $400 over the amount raised last year. The $4,600 raised last year was used in
hospitals in Korea, for the use of Korean civilian amputees in the war. This year the project is closer to
home, in Davidson to be exact. The plans are now to move the present YMCA hut, because they don't own
the land it is on now. The idea is to fix up the hut, by means of roofing, fixing the
windows, heating, and plumbing. The cost of this will be approximately $2,200, said Professor Bevan in an address to the
student body yesterday morning. He went on to say that playground and shop equipment are needed. They also want to
put a television set in the remodeled building. Supervisors are needed for...the project, along with a nursery to keep the
children off the streets. A place for dancing is needed also. In his address, Professor Bevan Wildcat Wrestlers... (Continued From

Dave Burns and Tommy Jordan. The rest of the schedule before Christmas includes the Carolinas AAU meet here on December
10 and 11. This two-day event will feature boys from all over the state. On December 17, the freshman and
varsity wrestlers will be hosts to Carolina’s frosh and varsity. The freshman team this year has been working hard along
with the varsity and should develop into some of the top wrestlers in future years with a couple of years'
experience. Leading candidates for the freshman team are: Sonny Kincey in the 157 class, David Brown, Johnny Grey, and Joe
Whitesell. The Wildkittens' first meet will be with the Carolina freshmen, but freshmen are eligible to enter in the AAU.
told of two similar projects that he knows of that worked remarkably well, with even less to work with than
our student body. Luckily the juvenile delinquency problem is not bad, due to the efforts of such men as ex-mayor
Beaty and the present mayor, Mr. Jackson. But that doesn’t mean that it cannot become bad. The YMCA is concerned
mostly with the children as they are our future citizens. A worthier cause couldn’t have been chosen. It is natural
to be a little resentful at being asked to contribute to something else, as we are always being asked to
give to this and that. But most of our past giving was most probably intangible, used for projects that we
never saw, or never will see. But this one is real. It is right at our back door, so to
speak. Let's make it a great success. Let’s go over the top in the 1953 Y Gift Fund. Sigurd Rascher...

have been called, and boomingly ordered, “Get me out of here,” so that he might soon have much-needed rest. Laughton

The Y.M.C.A. Negro Recreation Hut, which was chosen by the student body as the project for this year’s annual Gift
Fund, was built back in the days prior to World War II by the Davidson College Y.M.C.A. Its original purpose
was specified as a recreational center for the Negro population of the community. Before the war, interest among the Negro
citizens ran high and Mr. Lester Hunsucker was delegated by the W.P.A. to direct a planned recreational program for the
local colored groups. Just when it appeared that the Hut was beginning to fulfill its real objective in the community,
the war descended, bringing with it to Davidson the overcrowded schools and impaired educational facilities which were typical of the
country in general. As the war progressed, the local Negro school found itself in dire need of additional cafeteria and
classroom space. The Y.M.C.A. recognized this need and granted the school permission to use the Hut. In serving this objective,
however, the original purpose of the Hut was lost. Soon after the war’s conclusion, a new Negro school was constructed
and the “Y” Hut was no longer needed as classroom space. The Y.M.C.A. then endeavored to reestablish it as a
center of recreation, but as would be expected, the years of hard use, both before and during the war had
taken their toll on the little frame building. At present, the Hut is used by Negro clubs, lodges, and various
other organizations. Its operation is supervised by a committee of Negro citizens, but this group is sorely handicapped by its
lack of funds necessary for the desperately needed improvements. Now, Mecklenburg County has requested that the Hut be removed from
the county-owned school grounds in the immediate future. As yet, no suitable location has been secured and it now appears
that a temporary lot will necessarily be purchased until a permanent site can be obtained. FRIDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1953 INTERCOLLEGIATE...
(Continued From Page Two) lowers as well. The defeatist attitude toward athletics which naturally pervades the student body reaches into
every phase of student activity on the campus, makes cynics of those who will no longer torture themselves with any
vain hope, and makes the mere mention of the word school spirit, as the typical student thinks of it, a
hollow mockery indeed. Davidson and defeat have become synonymous. It may make little difference to some of the students and
faculty whether we never win another major sport victory, or whether we even compete with other schools. But to the
majority of college students intellectual life and development alone offer barren prospects indeed. Most of us look on intercollegiate athletics
as an indispensable part of college life, regardless of what they may think about them at Oxford or the University
of Chicago. We do not ask for championship teams, we no longer even ask for an even break. We just
want to win enough to be able to go to our home towns, hold up our heads, tell people we
are from Davidson, and not feel like crawling under the table. We know that a school’s record on the field
of play is no indication of the job it is doing, and bears a secondary relation to its ultimate aims,
but do we have to prove this by setting up conditions so that we make the most dismal of athletic
showings before the public? There is no easy way out for Davidson. No matter what steps are taken some people
will be dissatisfied. At present, however, everyone who is remotely interested must be disgruntled. We want to see our full
intercollegiate program maintained at Davidson, but we fear that it will die on the vine, and that right early, unless
leadership asserts itself from some quarter and positive steps are taken. Hood Speaks... (Continued From Page Two) place. But about
the only time when fraternity groups can be assembled is on Thursday nights, and outdoor lighting at night is inferior
even with the best equipment. Besides, it would take a month of Thursdays to shoot all the groups if equipment
had to be moved from house to house. The only logical place to shoot the groups is in the Union
ballroom, where equipment may be set up permanently and groups moved in and out rapidly. Last, and most important of
all for Quips, is the loss of time and money involved. It would consume a considerable amount of both to
