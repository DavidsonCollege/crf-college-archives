### The Davidsonian - December 10, 1986

#### Cross Country Teams Finish Successful Season
By EDWIN PAGE

Davidson’s men's and women's cross country teams concluded their season in the cold mist on Nov. 15 at the NCAA
Regionals on the Furman University campus. The women finished 28th out of 29 teams in the optional meet while the
men finished 31st out of 34 teams.

While the numbers may not look overly impressive, it must be remembered that this meet drew the best teams from
states all around the Southeast. Also, many of the teams that Davidson usually runs against failed to field full teams
and thus were not counted in the standings.

Junior Laura Fannin, the number one runner for the women on the season, once again paced the Lady Cats over
the five-kilometer course with a time of 21:07. Freshman Lisa Culbertson came in second with a 21:25 and junior Morrow
Reeves placed third with a 21:33. Freshman Missy Willis finished on Reeves’ heels at 21:36. Junior Karen Kemerait and freshman
Ginny White finished with 23:36 and 24:24 respectively.

First-year coach Gary Andrew said of the women’s performance, “We didn't have a great race, but we didn’t have a
bad one either. I think this team peaked for the Southern Conference and not this meet.”

The men, by contrast, ran a great race despite running ten kilometers for the only time this season. Freshman Jay
Clugston ran his fastest eight kilometers of the season and senior Greg Foreman missed his best 8K time by only
five seconds. Junior Chris Fisher and senior captain Emil Cekada missed their best 8K marks by only six seconds.

Foreman paced the Cats with a time of 33:09, which made him the 10th fastest individual over ten kilometers in
Davidson history. Fisher followed him in with a 34:11. Fisher was the Cats' number one runner throughout the early part
of the season and Foreman held down that spot during the latter half of the campaign. Clugston ran a 34:24
for third best and Cekada came in fourth at 34:31. Sophomores Bob Cornish, Bill Hartman, and Jay Barron rounded out
the squad.

Andrew summed up the Cats’ year, “We had a great season. It was a lot of fun and a good
learning experience. Next year the team will know better what to expect from me and I will be able to
set up workouts to match their abilities better. Everyone on the team had a great attitude and I consider the
season a big success.”

Cekada also felt good about the season. “For as young a team as we were, we performed really well. We
were a little inconsistent and we lacked depth but we ran very well our last two meets, and that’s what
we were shooting for all season.”

#### IMAC Basketball and Street Hockey Seasons Start
By JILL BOYETTE

IMAC basketball has officially begun with five-on-five games in both men’s and women’s leagues. There are several changes in IMAC
basketball this year. First of all, a minimum of ten players is required for each team roster in men’s B-league
and the women’s league. Secondly, the $10 entry fee is non-refundable. Finally, the baseball team will not be officiating IMAC
basketball this year. To solve this problem, IMAC recruited interested students, faculty, and staff members who are capable and interested
in officiating for intramural basketball.

As a precaution, we are requiring that each team pick two members to be a ref during the season (as
designated on the team roster). If there is a lack of referees, we will pool these team refs and choose
them randomly to officiate games. Presently, we have enough capable referees to handle all the officiating necessary for this season.

#### Football Wrap-Up
By MIKE ADAMS

The Davidson football season concluded with a 51-28 loss to Catawba to finish with a 0-9 record. The Catawba game
was the top offensive performance of the year for the Cats. Senior quarterback Steve Bradley passed for 293 yards, the
best performance of his career. He also had four of his six touchdown passes in that game. Unfortunately, the battered
Davidson defense was unable to stop the Catawba offense.

A few statistics tell the story of the Wildcats’ season. Davidson scored 12.1 points per game. They gave up an
average score of 45.1. The Cats managed an average of 222 yards of total offense, but surrendered yardage at a
464-yard clip. Davidson did manage to outpass its opponents, though. The Cats threw for 186 yards per game while holding
opponents to 182 yards.

Davidson outshone its opponents in one aspect of the game: punt returns. Here, the Cats averaged an excellent 16.8 yards
per return while holding opponents to just over 10 yards per return. Sophomore Brian Overcash led the team with a
20-yard average.used lots of razzle-dazzle on punt returns including reverses and fake reverses. The best performers for the Cats this
season were Bradley and senior defensive back Gary Stewart. Bradley passed for an average of 120 yards per game and
threw six touchdown passes. Stewart led the team in tackles with 80 despite missing playing time with injuries. There is
hope for Davidson's future despite the poor showing this season. This hope lies in the youth of this year’s squad,
from which many solid performers are returning. The two leading rushers will both be back next season. Junior Aaron Edwards
and freshman Brian Kelly both rushed for a little over 100 yards this season. Kelly was very hard to stop
for a loss, losing just three yards on carries all season. The second leading quarterback, freshman Peter Hughes, will also
be back. He threw four touchdown passes this year while yielding only seven interceptions. The Cats also return a good
group of receivers. Sophomore Michael Gross caught 18 passes for an 11.4 yard average and one touchdown. Freshman Shan Teel
snagged 26 passes and four touchdowns. Junior Charlie Winborne was the leading receiver with 21 catches for 298 yards and
one touchdown. A strong linebacking corps also returns for the Cats. Junior Howard Humphries was the second leading tackler with
78. Freshmen Ken Nazemetz and Cole Thomason also turned in good years with 63 and 60 tackles, respectively. Six of
Thomason’s tackles were quarterback sacks. These young men should definitely improve, hopefully enough to put some numbers in the win
column in the near future.

They have been trained by baseball coach George Greer, a certified official, so they know their job. Please do not
tell them how to call the game. If there are any complaints about IMAC refs, report them to the IMAC
office, but remember that the refs have the right to report problem players, too. Three new rules for five-on-five have
been established. One, only one former varsity player allowed per team and spouses of faculty and staff are ineligible. Two,
the clock will run continuously until the last two minutes of the second half and then it will stop for
out of bounds, loose balls, fouls, etc. Three, referees have the right to throw out any player who receives two
or more technical fouls and if that player refuses to leave the gym, then his/her team must forfeit. Street hockey
also has a rule change concerning an inbounds pass. On an inbounds pass the defender must be given four feet
of space in order to make the pass. IMAC sponsored a referee clinic last Sunday to present this new rule
and to emphasize the necessity of officiating. We hope that all the street hockey teams will make considerable effort to
appear for their ref assignments. Three-on-three play will begin early next week and schedules will be available in the IMAC
office by Friday afternoon. After Christmas, IMAC will sponsor a racquetball contest and a swim meet, so sign up in
the gym if you are interested.

Wrestling continued compiling a .500 record. Although Sentell has no dominant moves, his natural athleticism and combativeness make him an
exciting wrestler to watch. Junior Doug Batcheller fills the 167-weight class. Although Batcheller has not wrestled in college, his strength
and varied repertoire of moves should carry him through this year. Heinze has done extremely well in this year’s preseason
matches. In the Winston-Salem State tournament he placed third; in the Elon tournament he took second. Last year he led
the team in falls and takedowns. Heinze also won the outstanding wrestler award for 1986. The 190-pound weight class wrestler
is junior Doug Saintsing. Saintsing did not wrestle as a sophomore, but started for the Wildcats as a freshman. Saintsing
is quick on his feet for a big man and took fourth in the Winston-Salem State tournament this year. Senior
Gary Branch returns to his position as heavyweight. Branch is from Charlotte, but spent his summer at a wrestling camp
in New York and also worked with James Johnson, a world-class wrestler. He is very strong and quicker on his
feet than many heavyweights. He started the season with a preseason second place finish at the Winston-Salem State tournament. The
team opens the regular season Dec. 10 against Winston-Salem State and the first home match is Saturday against Barber Scotia
at 2 p.m. Excited about the upcoming season, Sentell said, “We're looking forward to wrestling at home and would appreciate
fan support. Personally, I’m ready to ‘Grab ‘em by the face’.”
