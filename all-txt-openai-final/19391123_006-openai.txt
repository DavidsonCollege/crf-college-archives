Corps Area Leader Will Inspect Here
Major J. L. Ballard Gives Talk At Meeting of Scabbard and Blade

The Davidson Chapter of Scabbard and Blade, national military honor society, met on Wednesday night, November 15, in the Scabbard
and Blade room. At this meeting, it was announced that word has been received that the company will be inspected
by the corps area inspector on December 9. A feature of the meeting was a talk by Major J. L.
Ballard, freshman instructor in military science and tactics of the local R. O. T. C. He is considered to be
an authority on military law.

Honorary Members
Many honorary members of Scabbard and Blade were present at the meeting. Several Davidson College faculty members are honorary members
of the fraternity, as well as some of the townspeople. The meeting was in charge of Bill John, first lieutenant
of the company, and was in the form of an open meeting.

Despite a slight drop from last year's number, the B. S. 1 enrollment is gradually increasing. This year it numbers
212 students, a relatively high percentage of the student body.

Leading in popularity, however, is the B. S. 2. This course has attracted 327 students, over half the entire student
body, and has shown a steady increase since it was first offered.

Largest Enrollment
English is the single study most in demand, with an enrollment of 433. Next in order are Bible with 391,
and economics with 258. Political science, mathematics, and history follow close with 248, 240, and 217 respectively. Next most popular
group is the natural sciences: biology 198; chemistry 155, and physics 106.

Despite the decline of the classics, modern languages show up well with Spanish in the lead with 211, French next
with 167, and German with 106.Ger- | rae eer Ber 5 subject alive, Every three or four | dents at
