FREDDIE IS HERE!

A special interview with a returning
freshman!! All you need to be
“here again next year.”

What advice can you give freshmen pertaining
to academics?

Freddie: The most important part is
to make sure you're attending class.

Purchasing books is often helpful,
and showing up for tests and turning
in papers.

Davidsonian: What is the best advice
you can give about extracurricular activities?

David Seman: The sort of extracurricular activities
I recommend are those outside the classroom.
Obviously, you cut down your learning
potential by attending class too
often.

When the winter comes, remember that the
best spot for sunbathing is right outside my window.
For instance, it is a great spot for tanning.

Guys, however, should stay away from
that. Study in your rooms with
blinds shut. Forget hitting on women
for your first year. You can
concentrate on studies. Leave the
freshman females to us, uh, I mean
to upperclassmen such as myself.

Davidsonian: Can you explain the alcohol
policy to freshmen?

David Seman: What about the school providing
students with condoms?

Of course! The alcohol policy is, after
all, a policy on alcohol. Everyone
should have a policy on alcohol and
alcohol is usually my policy.
Well, it would certainly be nicer if they
provided us with books. I'd be
happy to buy my own books. I'm not
sure how much of our tuition
hike went towards the condoms,
nor what kind of selection we have.
I'll have to look into that for future
reference.

Hey, sure, no problem. So, do I
get paid for this? Tell me,
you're going to put this interview on the
front page, right?
