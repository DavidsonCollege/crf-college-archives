The DAVIDSONIAN Vol. IV.

Basket Ball Season Opens With Victory
Charlotte Y. M. C. A. An Easy Victim---The Schedule.

The 1917 basket ball season had a most auspicious opening on last Saturday night when the Red and Black five
were victorious over the team representing the Charlotte Y. M. C. A., by a score of 60 to 22. The
game was staged at the local Y. M. C. A., and a large audience was present, completely filling the area
around the court on the ground floor, and also the galleries. The game, despite the one-sidedness of the score, was
fast and interesting throughout and the Davidson team showed up to especially good advantage, considering the brief period of the
pre-season practice. The whole team was working in good form and the student body is much encouraged as to the
prospects for a great season to come.

“AL” Reese, playing a running-guard, played one of the fastest and smoothest games ever seen on the local floor, throwing
11 field goals and two foul goals for the highest individual score of the evening. Captain Hengeveld was a close
second to Reese in the matter of scoring, and his playing was both steady and spectacular. King at forward played
his usual fast and snappy game, and he got away with a large number of field goals. Walker at guard
was the mainstay on the defensive, his playing being hard and steady. The passing of the team as a whole
was not as smooth as could be wished, but this requirement will undoubtedly be met before many days of practice
have passed.

The Y. M. C. A., showing good material, were not at their best by any means. Davenport at center was
the outstanding star for his team and his playing was of the highest order. Howell, at forward, also played a
good game, shooting three field goals.

Local Mission Study Rally.

DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N. C., JANUARY 17, 1917. No.14 Missionary Study Rally | News and Happenings Practically Complete | To
Be Held Tomorrow

Dr. Homer MacMillan, of Atlanta, to Make Address Tomorrow Night.

Dr. Homer MacMillan, of Atlanta, will address the Y. M. C. A. at its annual meeting. Dr. MacMillan is one
of the most popular speakers in the Southern Church. It has been said of him that he is received more
warmly than any secretary of the Church wherever he goes. Lately, he has been interested in the development of the
West, especially in forwarding the interests of the Church there. He takes a lively interest in the problems of immigration
and the duty of America to her immigrants. He hasn't announced a subject for Thursday night, but he will probably
speak on some phase of Home Mission work. It will pay any man, whether he is interested in Home Missions
or not, to come out and hear him, for he will say anything he has to say in an interesting
and entertaining way. He takes a great interest in college men and has a very attractive personality. Plans will be
made for the starting of the Spring term mission classes at this meeting of the Y. M. C. A., and
it is hoped every man in the student body will attend.
