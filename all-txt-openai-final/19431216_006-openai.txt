SPE’s SET HOT PACE

Owens showed the way with 11 points.

The K. A.’s held the runner-up slot in spite of a 36-8 shellacking at the hands of the Betas. The
game was ordered replayed after the presence of an ineligible player in the Beta lineup was discovered. The K. A.’s
have been led to date by George McAden, high scoring forward.

The K. S.’s and Betas remained close on the heels of the pace-setters. Both clubs have shown great improvement recently
and promise to give the leaders a run for their money. Kelly and Suggs have been the leading scorers for
the Sigmas while Alphin has become the key man in the Beta attack.

The Pikaps and Pikas currently occupy the cellar berths with no prospect of bettering themselves. Bennett and Floyd have been
by far the outstanding men on the Pi Kap five while Craven and O’Brien have played consistent ball for the
Pikas.

The Catawba Indians invaded the Wildcat lair and were soundly shellacked by the red hot Presbyterian cagers. The locals used
the entire squad to subdue the blue and white forces from Salisbury 49-25. Mike Williams again led the scoring with
12 points. Big Jim Lowry was runner-up with 10. Haller, of Catawba, repeatedly brought the crowd to its feet with
beautiful hook shots from the corner of the court. His marksmanship resulted in 13 points and the scoring honors for
the night. McGinnis, diminutive Indian guard, turned in a fine floor game.

the men and women in the services, and the total approach, he stated, is reaching hundreds of thousands for good.
Dr. Frew paid high tribute to the chaplains at the Fort, whom he entertained at a special luncheon, “Their work
is not with the gun nor the bayonet, but it is with the Sword of the spirit, and they are
wielding it with power,” he said.

Ed.: “How about a feature on rationing?”

Ed.: “Naw, Ferret, there are too many points to it. Besides we need an article with oomph to it, like
the ‘Spider.’”

S. Ed.: “Hey, how does ‘Davidson shellacked Charlotte Y’ sound?”

Ed.: “Naw, Jake, use trounced instead of shellacked. You see shellack might have alcohol in it and we can’t take
chances.”

Snoop (Suddenly alive): “What if I do a sequel to the ‘Spider?’ You know, sorta serial-like: Whew, I believe I’ve
got something there.”

Ed.: “No, that’s been done.”

S. Ed.: “Say, Ed., looks like I will have to give you honorable mention in this write-up of the game.
Ha! Ha! (If I don’t spread it on, this rag will have a new sports editor. Freedom of the press,
bah!)”

Snoop: “Why don’t people read the Observer, then we could get some sleep.”

Ed.: “Y’all see there isn’t any news, don’t you? Hey, Williamson, change the headlines and run the same stories that
we ran in the last issue.”

Cushman: “The ads will all be different and that’s all anyone reads anyway.”

The Cast: “Merry Christmas.”
