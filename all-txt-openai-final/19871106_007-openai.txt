The Water Engine’s study of a century of illusory progress

By JON BOLES and SUZANNE CRAYMER

Take everything you hear in this show with a grain of salt. Things are not what they seem. David Mamet’s
play, Mr. Happiness and the Water Engine, studies a century of illusory progress. The setting, a Chicago radio station in
1933 during the Century of Progress Exposition, ties together the two “scenes.” Mr. Happiness, Jim Dillon, and Miss Happiness, Donna
Peters, bring Dear Abby onto the airwaves. Mr. and Miss Happiness glance over a few select letters and conclude that
all of mankind’s problems boil down to five simple conflicts: traumas of the heart. These two characters are insincerity personified.
The saccharine voices of Mr. and Miss Happiness convey their lack of concern for the people they are supposed to
be helping.

The Water Engine begins with a confusing deluge of characters and skits. Charles Lang (Carey Rowan) presents a mechanistic world
view, an anonymous woman speaks of a chain letter, and a secretary (Alyson Watts) whines into a phone. All the
characters read their lines somewhat tonelessly off scripts while staring at the microphones which dangle from the ceiling.

Charles Lang (Carey Brown) argues with his innocence prompts his lawyers Oberman (Bill Sutton) and Gross (Jonathan Darsey). He seems
to awaken the other characters with his passion for what he believes in. The struggle to get the water engine
produced unifies and motivates the masses. His sister, Rita (Laura Bowen), repeatedly warns him to “take care” when he deals
with the evil patent man (Bill Sutton).

The cast slowly comes alive as the conflict develops, moving the action from the static confines of the radio station
into a broader framework. It is a difficult transition, but is carried off quite effectively. The actors, meanwhile, go from
simple radio voices to vivid portrayal of emotional extremes, from the deadpan of an office secretary to the fervent passions
of soapbox speakers in a park. It is, as the program warns, a fact that while technology has progressed, mankind
is still struggling with the same basic conflicts.

Pop Film Bill Cosby

By JOHN HARRIS

How refreshing it is to hear a comic who doesn’t feel it necessary to use the “f-word” every ten seconds!
Bill Cosby’s concert film, Bill Cosby Himself, pays tribute to one of America’s best-loved funny men and the fact that
you don’t need blue humor and four-, six-, and twelve-letter words to get laughs. Unlike some other comics such as
Eddie Murphy, who quickly shot to fame via his Saturday Night Live exposure, his charismatic presence, and the sheer audacity
of his colorful though mostly substance-less material, and Richard Pryor, who often relies on his own faults and addictions as
sources for his tragic, albeit often brilliant, material, Cosby tackles primarily family issues. He comments (lengthily, I might add) on
the topics of natural childbirth, (“...but the father can have all [the drugs] he wants!”) the ups and downs of
child-rearing, smoking, and his various laugh-at-yourself views on minor atrocities of Everyman’s life. Most notable, however, is his routine on
the visit to the dentist. You need to make a point of seeing that one particular bit, at least.

Which brings us to my next point, that of needing to see only part of the film. Most of the
sketches in this film have been repeated so often in various other forms of media (books, The Tonight Show, various
TV specials) that there is probably little in this movie that many of us haven’t seen.play which is difficult to
follow, broken and at the same time held together by a series of statements which recur at unexpected moments—"Do not
break the chain."; "Take care." These are delivered with credibility, as are such Robert Nesbit Mr. Over- characters, some for
profit, some for the good of mankind. This conflict between idealism and self-interest brings home the inane truisms as "They're
all thieves, you know" and "There is a way things are." The audience leaves Hodson Hall with a firmer grasp
on human nature, and how things really are. probably heard or seen somewhere else anyway.

Another problem with this movie, as is the case with many comedy-concert films, is the structure of the presentation as
it translates into feature-film form (try saying that three times fast!). All of the Cos' material is presented in pseudo-anecdotal
form, which is fine, but it gets old. To a live crowd this format works well, but a theater audience
could easily grow weary of the monotony surfacing when he drags out some of his longer monologues. However, I speak
with a certain degree of admitted bias. By virtue of the job I held for the 15 months before this
school year began, I went to the movie a tough audience. Having the distinction (?) of having seen over 400
(really!) comedy acts in the last year-and-a-half, I have come to expect a great deal from the more established and
well-reputed stand-ups. Cosby does, however, address his topic material openly without being too judgmental or preachy.

By the same token, he never aborts his "family material" theme for stock material or current-events-spawned attempts at character assassinations.
Much of his material is drawn from his own family experiences. In fact, the family structure on The Cosby Show
mirrors his real family structure quite overtly. I even believe that his tensions about raising a family were deliberately touched
on by the song that plays under the film's opening credits, "It Seemed Like a Good Idea at the Time."
Cosby never steps over the line from gentle mockery to insult, and that in a nutshell might explain his wide
appeal. That in itself, however, does not a concert film make. This film has several good moments, but the viewer
must be willing to wade through a great deal of old and oft-exposed material to hear them. I don't wish
to discourage anyone from seeing this, but anyone who does go may be wise to sit in a seat in
which occasional fidgeting won't create too much personal discomfort. Bill Cosby Himself plays in the 900 Room Friday night at
8:30 p.m.
