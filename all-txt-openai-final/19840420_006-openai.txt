**Guarneri Quartet Makes Music Appealing**

By JESSICA HUNT

The Davidson College Artist Series winds up its 1983-84 season with a concert by the prestigious Guarneri String Quartet this
Monday. The quartet includes violinists Arnold Steinhardt and John Dalley, cellist David Soyer, and violist Michael Tree. The quartet’s members
have performed together since 1964, when the quartet debuted at Vermont's Marlboro Music Festival. Three of the four musicians attended,
and currently serve as faculty members at Philadelphia’s Curtis Institute of Music, and all four are music professors at the
University of Maryland.

Each member of the quartet performs as a soloist as well as in collaboration with other artists. Steinhardt made his
solo debut at age fourteen with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and was a winner of the Leventritt International Award. Steinhardt’s
phrasing and tone provide a major contribution to the quartet's overall character and sound. Quartets are said to be only
as strong as their second violin — in this case, the violin of Dalley. Dalley debuted at age fourteen and
toured widely in Europe and Russia before teaching at the Oberlin Conservatory. He continues his craftsmanship by making violin bows
in his spare time.

Violist Tree began his career studying the violin and debuted at Carnegie Hall at age twenty. Having learned to play
the viola at the Curtis Institute, Tree has won recognition with both instruments. Cellist Soyer began playing at age eleven
— rather late for a virtuoso performer — but made his debut at age seventeen with the Philadelphia Orchestra. It
is Soyer who owns the Andrea Guarneri instrument constructed in 1669 from which the quartet takes its name.

The Guarneri is credited with having made quartet music accessible and appealing to the general public yet without sacrificing musical
concerns. Their performances are renowned for seamless unity of tone and range of expression. Their recording of the Cavatina Movement
from Beethoven’s Opus 130 was encapsulated in the Voyager II and launched with other artifacts representing the best of American
culture.

Monday night’s program will feature Beethoven's Quartet in E-flat major, Opus 74, “The Harp”; Kodaly’s Quartet in D major, No.
2, Opus 10; and Schubert's Quartet in D minor, No. 14, Opus Posthumous D. 810 “Death and the Maiden.” A
reception following the concert will be held in the Morrison Room. Tickets are on sale between 2 and 5 p.m.
at the Union Box Office and at the door.

**R.E.M. Shows Control in Reckoning**

The mad Marx Brothers return to Davidson Friday in The Cocoanuts, and what a blessed event. This delightful 1929 comedy
provides reason enough to forget Easter, reserving holy time to the gods of mirth — Groucho, Harpo, Chico, and of
course, Zeppo. The brothers’ rapid-fire wit, spiked with irony and sarcasm, remains as funny and effective today as it was
50 years ago. Representing early Marxism (in fact, The Cocoanuts was the first Marx film), each sequence either creaks in
laughable stereotypes or explodes beyond the outer realm of non sequitur. The primitive one-point “stage” perspective (to accommodate the latest
fad in film, sound) gives the brothers a wonderfully naturalistic playground, and encapsulates classic comedy. Groucho and Chico’s exchange concerning
the definition of “viaduct” is particularly amusing, and Harpo’s silent antics — chasing women, eating pieces of clothes, etc. —
are as endearing as ever.

Beware however! If you’ve never seen a Marx brothers film, be sure to drop all conventions before watching — reality,
love, hate, even death itself ultimately become old one-liners in this mad, mad world. Perhaps the “anti-sanity” format accounts for
the recent resurgence of interest in Marx Brothers films. In a world filled...With paranoia, nuclear weapons, Marx exploitively hitting a
mustachioed smoothy over the head with a hammer, ragtime songs, circus invocations, Seuss-like wit, and aerobics, Harpo.

It has all been fun. That is, watching a University of Georgia party band put out a single, have it
get a Village Voice award for best single of the year, and finally see the band get Rolling Stone Critics’
awards for “best new group” and “Album of the Year.” R.E.M. has done a lot since its members all dropped
out of school and formed a band because vocalist Michael Stipe “got tired of cooking steaks.”

R.E.M.’s latest effort, Reckoning, is an excellent follow-up to last year’s critically acclaimed Murmur. Unlike Murmur, jokingly called “Mumble,” Reckoning
does not have an obvious hit like “Radio Free Europe.” But the songs on Reckoning could stand on their own;
all are well composed and performed. Each song consists of vocal harmony, bass, and drums layered over driving guitar melodies.
Surprisingly though, the R.E.M. “formula” does not detract from the immense diversity of Reckoning.

Many fans asked even before Reckoning came out, “will we be able to understand the lyrics?” Well, yes and no.
Like Murmur, some of the lyrics on Reckoning remind one of listening to a radio station out of range. But
does that really matter? R.E.M.’s music has a real impressionistic quality that gives it a subtle, but firm effect. A
line from the first cut, “Harbor Coat,” sums up the focus of all the songs: “There’s a splinter in your
eye and it reads react: R-E-A-C-T.” That splinter is love and the conflicts that arise in human relationships. For example,
“Time After Time” asks: “If a friend takes a fall, are you obligated to follow?” Instead of trapping their feelings
inside, the band lets them all out in their music.

From “South Central Rain (Sorry)” we hear:
Did you never call
I waited for your call
The rivers of suggestion
Are driving me away
Sorry
Sorry
Sorry

Yet R.E.M. has more control in expressing themselves than in their past efforts. “Camera” breaks from the two racing numbers
before it (“Second Guessing” and “Letter Never Sent”), and quietly explores the meaning of a past experience, where “It was
simple then.” The music and lyrics keep echoing the haunting thought: “will you be remembered?” “If I could be a
camera,” the song says, then every person, feeling, and experience would have everlasting meaning. Though remembering everything is impossible, writing
songs about one’s life sure helps.

Reckoning has its funny moments, too. After “Camera,” the band starts out with a riff reminiscent of Deep Purple’s “Smoke
on the Water.” They cut it short, and with an “all right” from producer Mitch Easter, R.E.M. breaks into a
country-style number called “Rockville.” The song highlights everything country music is all about: depression, lost love, and independence. “At night
I drink myself asleep/ And I don’t even care that you’re not here,” the song laments, and later declares that
it’s time to leave behind all the factory jobs of “full-time filth” and everything otherwise unpleasant in life — “don’t
go back to Rockville.../ And waste another year.” “Rockville” is filled with country guitar licks which have all the spring
of a Willie Nelson number coming over a radio-alarm clock at 6 a.m. on a cold, rainy morning.

Reckoning has much to say as well as a lot to enjoy; which is what the best music is all
about, anyway.
