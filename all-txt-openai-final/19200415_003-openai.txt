THE DAVIDSONIAN, April 15, 1920.

ARE YOU A SPONGE OR ARE YOU A SIEVE?
Mr. Miles Asked This Question of Ministerial Candidates.

Mr. Miles talked to the Ministerial Band Sunday afternoon. His text was a passage from Ecclesiastes, “And further by this,
my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end, and much study is a weariness of the
flesh.” He gave some very useful hints on our reading matter. Mr. Miles said that we are one of four
things: a sponge, a funnel, a strainer, or a sieve. The first of these soaks up everything. The funnel holds
nothing. The strainer keeps the residue and lets the good go. Last of all, the sieve keeps the good and
lets the residue go. He said that too much reading of good books was not a weariness of the flesh.
He also told the band the importance of being familiar with Shakespeare, Dickens, and other good writers, which would give
a rare choice of words. The last warning given was the danger of ministers living too much in terms of
their own parish; and that preachers should be familiar with all current topics. It is urged that more of the
ministerial candidates be out to the meetings as the talks we are to have this spring should not be missed
by any of them.

SUNDAY SCHOOL AND BIBLE CLASSES
The attendance last Sunday at most of the county Sunday Schools was greatly boosted mainly due to the beautiful weather,
which made the fellows want to get out of doors and welcome springtime. The schools which are leading the others
in numbers and the number of students going out, strange to say, are the farthest from the Hill. Due to
the large number of men who remained in Charlotte and the late time of night which those who returned arrived
on the campus, no Bible classes were held. The attendance at the different country schools was as follows:

Teachers. Total.
Shearer Chapel 8 71
Caldwell 6 57
Brawleys 5 44
Cornelius 2 41
Oak Grove 3 14
Mill 3 13

CAMPUSISMS
There are no more mumps on the Hill. Mrs. Robinson “cleared” the last case Monday. W. F. Covington, Mitchell, A.
M., and Hanrahan, B. S., composed one-half of the sick list last week. The other half, Lo-, G. S., and
Robinson, A. G., we are sorry to say, is not getting along so well; both of these boys are still
pretty sick.

DAVIDSON STUDENT ATTENDS NATIONAL STUDENT VOLUNTEER COUNCIL
Mr. J. P. Price has just returned from New York, where he has been attending the National Student Volunteer Council.
This council is composed of two students from each state, and meets to discuss the various problems of student life.
This was the first meeting of the kind ever held. It is run entirely by the Student Volunteers of the
United States. J. P. Price was one of the two delegates to be chosen from the North Carolina Student Volunteer
Union.

“Coach” Bill Fetzer spent Sunday on the Hill. Likewise “Lump” Richardson, one of Fetzer's old-time Wildcats.

Miss Eloise Martin, of Converse College, spent the weekend with her parents, Dr. and Mrs. Martin. Mrs. Martin has returned
from a rather extended visit to Pass Christian, Miss.

Little Freddie Reed, who was operated on in a Charlotte sanitarium last week for mastoiditis, is getting along splendidly.

C. E. EXECUTIVE MEETING CALLED
Next Friday evening at the home of Mrs. Hamilton the officers and committee chairmen of the Christian Endeavor will hold
their monthly meeting. Many plans for improving the society are to be discussed, and the committee work is to be
more highly organized. The expert Endeavor class, taught by J. P. Price, was not held last week on account of
the leader’s absence. The Intermediate C. E., under the leadership of Ed Cunningham and Miss Potts, is doing splendid work.
All the village young folk from ten to 15 are invited to attend the meeting of this group. Next Monday
night there will be a moving picture from the U.S. P. H. S. on the social disease menace. It will
be accompanied by a lecture by Dr. J. W. MacConnell. The picture will be free to all college men and
such from the village as wish to attend.

Dr. Martin rode to Charlotte one day last week in his faithful (?) little Buick “4”—he rode back in a
brand new Franklin. For some time suspicion has been rife as to the “why” of the new building in Dr.
J. M. Douglas’ backyard—a new Buick “6.”

JOHN BARRYMORE ENTERTAINS AT THE MOVIES
The Dictator, featuring John Barrymore, was shown last Friday.

VOLUNTEER BAND GIVES FEED
The Volunteer Band gave a sumptuous feed in the Alumni Gymnasium.on April 6. On this night, the retiring president, L.
G. Calhoun, made his farewell address, and the newly elected vice-president, W. E. Crane, set forth some plans for the
coming year. Snappy toasts were proposed by several of the members, adding “pep” to the evening’s entertainment.

The regular Sunday meeting of the Volunteer Band was held in the gymnasium. O. P. Hart spoke on South America,
and P. D. Miller gave a talk on Mexico. Various members shared their experiences, adding to the evening’s enjoyment.

From the pleasure that the audience derived from the performance, it would do well to have another John Barrymore picture
for the program this spring.

AN OLD FRIEND BACK AGAIN
This is NOT a “near beer,” but a thoroughly fermented and perfected LAGERED BREW made of barley and hops only,
but with the high wines removed by our PATENT VACUUM PROCESS leaving all the original brew flavor and snap intact,
so it is delightfully EXHILARATING. Remember this is brewed just like the beer of 40 years ago, but treated under
Sec 47 of the U.S. “Dry” laws. We ship to any part of the U.S.

ONE GRADUATE of our Training School for Life Insurance Salesmen recently produced $808,000 in forty-five days. During the same period,
twenty-eight Training School men produced $2,594,000, an average of $92,000 per man. When an agent signs a contract with the
Southern Life and Trust Company, we don’t pat him on the back, turn him loose and tell him to “go
to it.” We give him a preliminary correspondence course, and then a course in our Training School at the Home
Office, and then keep in touch with him and help him overcome his weak points and strengthen his strong points.
As a result, our Training School men are making good. Drop us a line and ask us to give you
full particulars.
