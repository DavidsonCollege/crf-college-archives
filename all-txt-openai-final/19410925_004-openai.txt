Among THE GREEKS

**Pi Kappa Alpha**
A very successful Rush Week was concluded with the entire chapter attending the game. Brother Vosbergh operated in Lynchburg and
Brother Hodges visited his O.A.O. in Greensboro. The remainder of the chapter concluded the evening festivities with a Tavern detail.

**Pi Kappa Phi**
Pi Kapps stayed on the campus this weekend to celebrate the ending of rush week and to see the Davidson-Rollins
football game. After the game, all brothers attended (even one or two with dates) and drove to the big city
(Charlotte) afterwards. Alumni of Pi Kappa Phi returning to the campus for the weekend were brothers Boyd Flynn, '41, Frank
Niven, '41, and Sam Hemphill, '38. Several families of the brothers visited at the house after the game. All brothers
of last year's undergraduate classes of Pi Kappa Phi returned to school this year with the exception of brother Bob
Garney, who is working in Newport News, Va. Pledge Gene Head '44 will attend Stetson University this year.

**Kappa Sigma**
The Sigma house was filled this weekend with brothers of past years who came back for the game. The same
spirit of brotherhood prevailed, and all had an enjoyable time. Other welcomed guests were Martha Sharpe of Burlington and Julian
Squires of Charlotte. Present at the pledging ceremonies on Saturday were Dr. W. J. Martin, Dr. J. R. Cunningham, Dr.
F. W. Johnston, and Professor C. G. Davidson, all of Davidson. The weekend game attracted a host of other guests:
Margaret Ross and George Peters of Greensboro, Sara Robinson of Chester, South Carolina, Edith Sutton of Thomasville, Mary Lisk of
Charlotte, Louise Nichols of Rock Hill, the Bonner sisters of Valdese, Kendall Younger of Burlington, Ralph Payne of Burlington, Luke
Aull of Newberry, S.C., Bill Howell of Ellerbe, Leith Garrou of Valdese, Holt Barnwell of Fort Bragg, and Mr. and
Mrs. C. Ed Taylor of Southport.

**Phi Delta Theta**
The Phi house was filled with excitement last weekend because brothers Vereen and Dale, two graduates of last year, came
back. Vereen claims to have whipped up from his home in Moultrie, Georgia, in less than eight hours. Brother Dale,
past president of the chapter, was seen at Saturday’s football game with Miss Frances Bradley of Sweetbriar, who also was
a guest at the Fraternity house. There were no colossal details pulled this week because all the brothers and pledges
felt that they should catch up on lost sleep and study. Many of the pledges felt the call of Charlotte
on Sunday afternoon and some of the brothers accompanied them out to our sister school in Charlotte.

**S. A. E.**
Celebrating the end of a long, hard, but successful rushing season, the brothers all had a fine time at a
“feed” held after the Rollins game. The chapter welcomed new alumni George Grantham and Hector McLean, who were here with
their dates, Dot Hagood and Daniel. Also, old acquaintances Bob Grimsley and Yates Faison were here for the celebration. Brother
Reb Rummel came up from Fort Bragg for the football game, while on leave of absence. The parents of Pledge
John Maness visited the house Sunday afternoon. Many plans are being made to attend the game in Greensboro Saturday night.

**Phi Gamma Delta**
Most of the Phi Gams remained on the campus last Saturday where they witnessed the Davidson-Rollins football game. Sunday was
spent by some few in attempting to recover from the strain of rush week, but most of the brothers ran
true to form and left the college for more interesting places. Many alumni joined their brothers here at Davidson in
watching the Wildcats fight to a tie with the grid men of Rollins. Among those present were: George Richmond, “Shorty”
Parrish, Chase Brenizer, George Stowe, Dick Shore, B. B. Ryder, Charles Martin, Winston Taylor, Matt Long, Don Chipman, and Archie
Keal. Dates of the Phi Gams for the weekend included: Frances Hull, Hellen Lest, Ted Gill, and Winthrop Coleemtn. Other
guests were Caroline Cooper, Ruth Hayes, Jean Welsh, Betts Graham, and Mary Spencer, all of Charlotte.

**Kappa Alpha**
K. A. brothers and pledges attended the Davidson-Rollins game after a big rush week. Several boys hurried away Saturday evening
to get dates for the game. Of special note were the freshmen who stepped out early with their girlfriends. After
the game, Brother T. O. Pinkerton provided a feed for brothers, pledges, and friends. Many of the brothers and pledges
went to Charlotte for a good time following the disappointing game.

**Beta Theta Pi**
Brightening the corners of the Beta house during the past week were Sara Alice Clark, Jane King, Mary Davis Wolf,
Eloise Pickard, Jane Grey, Sharp, Judy Shoal, Margaret Parrington, and Virginia Broadway of Albemarle, Hiram White, and John Scott of
Charlotte. Saturday night most of the brothers took time out to relax at the football game. Among the dates who
attended the game were Sara Alice Clark, Jane King, Mary Davis Wolf, Eloise Pickard, Jane Grey, Sharp, Judy Shoal, Margaret
Parrington, and Virginia Broadway.

**Pritchett To Lead Vespers**
Dr. Cunningham To Speak At Winthrop Sunday
The President's office announced this week that the speaker for next Sunday night's vesper services will be Carl Pritchett, pastor
of the Davidson Presbyterian Church. Mr. Pritchett, by virtue of his record, is exceptionally well-fitted to speak to the students
of Davidson. He is a Davidson graduate, Class of '30, president of the student body, and a captain of both
the freshman and varsity basketball teams. For a time after graduation, he remained at Davidson as Secretary of the “Y,”
then entered Union Theological Seminary. So outstanding was his work there, that he was awarded the Hogg Fellowship, and remained
at Union for a year's study. In 1936, he accepted a call to the pastorate of the Presbyterian Church at
Smithfield, N.C., from which church he returned to Davidson in 1940. Sunday night, also, Dr. Cunningham will speak to the
students of Winthrop College.

Administration Makes Many Improvements Anonymous Benefactor Gives Robes To The College Choir OFFICES REDECORATED Inter-Office Communication System Added Among the
chief improvements noticed by upperclassmen on their return to school are the new furnishings in the chapel and administrative offices.
Subdued green draperies have been hung full length in all the chapel windows. Each drapery is caught back twice to
effect graceful lines and pleats. Most of the money for the draperies was donated anonymously by a patron of Davidson
College. New Vestments In addition, the Vespers Choir members are now robed in maroon vestments. These vestments were also an
anonymous gift to the college. Venetian blinds, flowing draperies, new furniture, and plush carpets are the main additions to the
administrative offices in Chambers Building. Those offices redecorated include that of Dr. Cunningham, President of the college; Prof. Bailey, Dean
of Students; Dr. C. K. Brown, Dean of Faculty; Mr. Hengeveld, Registrar; Miss Steele, Secretary to the president; Mr. Jackson,
Treasurer of the college; and Misses Jackson and Brown, secretaries to the dean and treasurer, respectively. In addition, an inter-office
communication system has been set up in the administrative offices. Thereby, much time and confusion are reported saved, creating more
efficiency.
