### The Copeland House Gallery

Ice. The word evokes a cold, chilling sensation or maybe an image of delicately melting crystals. Forty local artists responded
to the idea of ice and the results are now on display in Chambers Art Gallery.

"Charlotte On Ice" opened in a warm reception last week with a bluegrass band from Mooresville breaking the ice with
good country tunes. A festive atmosphere pervaded as artists, students, professors, and guests examined the diverse interpretations of "ice." The
representations range from realistic winter scenes to a stuffed satin hanging entitled "The Bride." In between are acrylics, pencil drawings,
and puns on the word "ice."

The artists are as different as the works they display. Larry Nerenstein is a young assistant professor of Art at
Queen’s College. At the reception, he seemed a perfect example of the stereotype artist with his outdated leather jacket. His
striking wedding cake "One Poisoned Tongue Ruined the Entire Wedding For Everyone" shimmers with the plastic dime store eyes that
change directions.

Nerenstein explains the impact of his work, "The surface is delicious. The painting spits at you in the face."

G.G. Kosh is a direct contrast to Nerenstein. She spoke about the excitement and embarrassment she feels in going to
a show where her work is exhibited. "I was afraid to walk in," she admits. Her circular collage of ice-filled
drinks entitled "What Makes the Town Go Round" seemed to be one of the most popular pieces at the opening,
especially among students. She cleverly uses the recent liquor-by-the-drink decision to show "Charlotte On Ice."

Some excellent photographs by Frank Bliss, Ron Chapple, Martha Straun, and Earl Lawrimore add an important dimension to the show.
Lawrimore uses the idea of Malcolm X’s "Soul On Ice" for his look at two inmates called "Single-Cell Lock-Up, Huntersville
Prison." Lawrimore serves on the advisory board of Huntersville Prison and had wanted to take pictures before.

"This was the push I needed," says Lawrimore. "I decided to use this angle on the idea of ice because
with a photograph it’s too easy to be literal."

Photographs of an ice cube arranged in a grid form one of the most exciting pieces in the show. Howard
Spector created "Blue Ice Pic" by taking several photos of the same ice tray under different lighting conditions. The result
is an impressive design which even spells out the word "ice."

Although much of the art exhibits a light-hearted feeling, some pieces show concern for serious problems. One of these is
a work which depicts the cold, isolated lives that people are forced to live in today’s society. Eric Anderson, who
teaches at UNCC, describes his work "as people on the outside looking in on others." The creation on display is
a silkscreen and drawing entitled "Charlotte On V-ice" and is from a series.

Anderson likes the idea of an exhibit with a theme because "it takes artists away from a certain direction and
makes them explore. The integration of Charlotte and Davidson artists is also very rewarding."

The ability to experience different moods and techniques keeps the exhibit fresh for the observer. The plexiglass creation called "Ice
Factorization" is a kinetic piece which is delicately activated by air and people around it. More important than the plexiglass
itself is what happens in the space around it, especially the formation of shadows. Bob Williams, usually a printmaker, describes
his work as cubistic, fragmenting the form of objects.

Art professors Herb Jackson and Russ Warren, who coordinated the show, also exhibit two massive works. "Charlotte On Ice" will
be on display until October 30th. Don’t miss the chill of your life.
