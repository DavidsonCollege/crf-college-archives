**The (Other) Zogby Poll asks the probing questions**
By Joy Gerpy and Matt Zogby

Miss Alabama in the 1994 Miss USA contest:
Question: If you could live forever, would you and why?
Answer: “I would not live forever, because we should not live forever, because, if we were supposed to live forever,
then we would live forever, but we cannot live forever, which is why I would not live forever.”

Watching the presidential debates, it was hard to ignore how similar the whole process is to a beauty pageant (or
scholarship program, depending on whom you ask). Candidates are paraded around like pieces of meat and are judged more on
their congeniality rather than on their policies and what they can actually accomplish. Now, honestly, would you really be surprised
if there was an opening dance number used to introduce them? And if there was, ratings and the number of
viewers would certainly triple.

In an effort to explore this theory, we have come up with some questions that should have been asked to
the candidates, and we then asked Davidson students what they think the candidates would say. We will now proceed to
beat our current topic to death. Join us.

**Question 1. If the candidates were trees, what kind of trees would they be?**

Bush had a variety of responses. One respondent said that Bush would be a tree with “strong roots in a
community like Davidson, a solid, Christian trunk, and long, leafy branches to provide shade for handicapped children on a hot
summer day.” Others said a dogwood, a weeping willow, a pine (because it’s “soft wood”), an oak because Bush is
“solid, wise, and hearty,” a bush, and of course, the obligatory plastic office tree. Two people voted for cactus. More
than one respondent pointed out that, “Bush doesn’t believe in trees.”

The overwhelming majority of students said Gore would be an oak. Interpretations of this phenomenon might vary. One person said
that he simply “resembles one” in his physical appearance. The first runner-up response was the common pine because “there are
loads of them, and they’re all the same.” The most passionate and poetic response came from someone who wished to
be known simply as Frah. He said that Gore would be a “pussy willow swaying in the wind of public
opinion.”

One student proudly responded that the tree that would best represent the candidates would be “cocker spaniels,” which brings us
to Question 2.

**Question 2. If the candidates were animals, what kind of animals would they be?**

Both candidates received a variety of responses for this question. Bush was compared to a naked mole rat, a dung
beetle, and an iguana. Two students referred to him as a bear. Continuing with the theme mentioned for the trees,
one respondent said that, “Bush doesn’t believe in animals.” Gore was called a naked mole rat, a llama, a walking
stick, a bear, a golden retriever, a squirrel, and a horse. One respondent called Bush a monkey, Gore a “real
man,” and Nader a “sweet, little honey bunch.” The same student who called Bush an elephant called Gore a donkey.
Unfortunately, none of these responses are correct. The correct answer is that Gore is a lemur, and Bush is an
otter.

**Question 3. If the candidates had one wish, what would it be?**

The vast majority of students said that both would wish either to be president or to win the election.However, some
astute members of the student body understand that there is more to life than winning or losing the presidential election.
One Sandra Twitt also said that both candidates would like “to have breasts as perky as Miss Idaho’s.” Bush’s wishes
varied from “real presidential credentials” to “eliminating the poor.” It is unclear at this juncture whether he meant to allow
the poor to rise to a higher tax bracket or simply to sweep them under the carpet. Students thought that
Gore would wish for anything from supreme power to “be more like Clinton, I mean, be more charismatic.” Once again,
Miss Anna Padget may have misunderstood the question. She said that Bush would wish for “eleventy billion to be a
real number.”

Question 4. What is the single greatest challenge facing their generation today? This question also brought forth a diverse array
of responses. More than one student said “the Constitution,” including one of your esteemed pollsters. Other answers included “choosing the
lesser of two evils,” “strategery,” and both menopause and impotence. One respondent said that Bush would respond by saying, “Could
you repeat the question?” and that Gore would say, “What is a generation anyway?” and then change the subject.

Question 5. Could the candidates name and spell all fifty states in alphabetical order? The numbers were fairly close on
this question. The students of Davidson College seem to put their faith in neither candidate when it comes to this
fairly menial task, which, by the way, both of your pollsters can do very well. Forty-five percent of respondents said
that Gore would be able to, while only 36% said that Bush could. One student said that neither could because
they would “forget some state like Iowa,” but we disagree since Iowa is something of a swing state. Another respondent
said that neither one could do it, “but Amber Atkins can.” One person said that it would just “take Bush
a long time,” and yet another said, “Bush may have a little trouble, but Gore would have studied.” The prophet
Frah said that Bush would respond, “Fifty states? Really?” while Gore would say, “Fifty! That’s the number Texas stands in...[insert
various statistical categories here].”

Question 6. Who would win the swimsuit competition? Gore won this competition with a hefty 60% of the vote, leading
Bush’s smaller 30%. Write-ins for Tipper comprised 10% of the vote. Your esteemed pollsters reserve comment until it is determined
what kind of swimwear they will be modeling. However, one of them is leaning toward Gore after careful examination of
the current cover of Rolling Stone.

Question 7. Who would win the talent competition, and with what talent? Bush received the overwhelming majority of the votes
for this competition. Some of his talents included a dance to the opening credits of The Beverly Hillbillies, an interpretive
dance to “Deep in the Heart of Texas,” whining, juggling, and “improvisation of how to be a president.” Gore only
received 36% of the votes for such talents as clogging to “Rocky Top,” stand-up comedy, bullshitting, and “blowing hot air
out of his ass.” While all of these responses are quite eloquent and well thought out, we at the (Other)
Zogby Poll think that the student body has drastically underestimated Gore and his incredible HTML skills.

With that, we conclude this week’s poll. We think we have shown the uncanny resemblance between the presidential election and
beauty pageants/scholarship programs. Unfortunately, after three debates the election is still quite close. It will all have to come down
to evening wear.
