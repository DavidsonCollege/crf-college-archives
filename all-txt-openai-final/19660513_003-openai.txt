Revolutions Will Play Great Role In Future

How well the United States faces the inevitable outbreak of future revolutions will greatly affect the prospects of man, according to newspaperman William Worthy, who visited Davidson recently. Current United States policy came under attack from Worthy for failure to meet adequately the situations created by these outbreaks.

"We are too prone to blame everything on the Communists, too much concerned for our own welfare rather than the well-being of the other country involved, and too willing to play policeman of the world," he asserted.

Worthy, a 1956-57 Nieman fellow in journalism at Harvard, spoke as a world traveler and correspondent for the Baltimore Afro-American. Agreeing with Senator William Fulbright, Worthy stated that it is misleading to view all revolutions as being either anti- or pro-Communist. We must look further and try to understand each revolution in the context of national problems and aspirations.

Worthy attacked American support of corrupt governments in areas of political instability. He claimed that such support stems from myopic attempts to gain economic benefit for American interests. Comparing President Lyndon Johnson to Sheriff Jim Clark of Selma, Worthy accused the United States of unjust intervention in Vietnam. The Viet Cong are not a front for Chinese aggression, said Worthy, and the United States attempts to stop an anti-colonial revolution with terrorist tactics.

In line with his opposition to United States attempts to act as “policeman of the world,” he attached the role of the CIA in fomenting artificial revolutions. Worthy did not entirely oppose American intervention in other parts of the world. He called for truly altruistic aid to underdeveloped areas and said that it is not the duty of the United States to term any revolution illegitimate.

Worthy, himself a Negro, explained the relation of the civil rights movement in the United States to events abroad. He pointed out that because of their low economic status a high percentage of Negroes are being drafted and serving in Vietnam. This, plus the fact that the war in Vietnam is taking on the overtones of the white versus the colored, is leading to widespread opposition to the war by American Negroes. He described the general attitude, “The Viet Cong never called me a nigger.”

The newspaperman further claimed that public support for the Vietnam war is eroding “as things go from bad to worse.” He pointed out that the war is beginning to reach into every part of the United States as casualties increase.

Dr. Harmon R. Holcomb, professor of philosophy of religion at Colgate-Rochester Seminary, developed the theme of “Prospects of Man” with reference to man's theological orientation in a fast-changing world. In a recent chapel speech, Holcomb concentrated mainly on the much-publicized Death of God Movement, with which he is in fundamental opposition. He has debated against a key figure in this movement, Paul Van Buren, Professor of New Testament at Temple University.

Despite his opposition to the Death of God theologians, Holcomb asserted that it is of the utmost importance that their movement be taken seriously, because it marks one of the few serious controversies in the modern Christian Church. The idea behind the movement is not a new one, he added. Secularists have been saying that God is dead for 400 years. The significance of the movement lies in the fact that it has its origins within the church, not outside it.

Holcomb’s main quarrel with the Death of God theologians is that they base their arguments on a logical impossibility. How can God, whose very essence is being, “die?” and if he is capable of dying, when did he die?

He humorously remarked that since the death of God is such an important event, it would seem that Van Buren and others might be able to agree on a date. The attempts of the Death of God theologians to focus their religion on Christ alone don't make sense, asserted Holcomb. If Jesus is not in some way united with God, he is just a dead first-century Jew and hardly a fit basis for a world-wide religion. He added that so much talk about Jesus only served to obscure the central issue of the controversy: the question of God's death.

Holcomb concluded his speech by stating that the movement isn’t really a “movement” at all. He charges that all the Death of God theologians say something different, and that there is no system whatsoever to their doctrines.

Man Free As God Dies, Jewish Rabbi Asserts

Rabbi Richard Rubenstein attacked the question of man's immediate future from a "Death of God" position in a series of lectures on campus in late March. The Jewish chaplain from the University of Pittsburgh concluded that man is not subject to the will of a god and is consequently free to act as he wishes as long as he is responsible for his actions. Thus, the Death of God theology, according to Rubenstein, is extremely appropriate and pertinent to man living under this existentialist ethic.

CONCEPT OF GOD

In defense of his position, he traced the development of the concept of god, explaining that men first lived a communal existence in which a tyrannical father dominated the younger men and “owned” all the women. The jealous young men eventually killed the tyrant and ate his body because of the reverence they held for him, but being so conditioned to fear of the omnipotent father and still mysteriously feeling his presence, they were afraid to enjoy the women. Rubenstein maintained that the image of god grew out of this attitude that men held toward their dead but somehow still present fathers: God became an all-powerful being who is murdered by men and who nevertheless prevents man's pleasure in life.

'DEATH-MYTH'

Rubenstein pointed to the Death of God movement as an extension of what he called the “death-myth,” noting that the crucifixion of Christ is still another version of the “death-myth.” Ramifications of the apparent validity of the Death of God theology, according to Rubenstein, include a need to change the popular concept of religion. It must be disconnected from God, he said, and become “the way men share the suffering and the great occasions of their lives.”

RITUAL

Consequently, ritualistic religions like Judaism and Catholicism, since they offer greater emotional enrichment, become more significant than more formal, less emotional religions like Protestantism. Rubenstein added, however, that even will find more meaning in the religions in which they were raised, regardless of the denomination, than they will find elsewhere. He indicted Protestants, claiming that they cannot escape from their tradition, yet their tradition offers little opportunity for emotional fulfillment. Sexual accomplishment or economic achievement are the only means for the development of the emotional life for Protestants, Rubenstein concluded.

Machines Replace Men

Because of rising automation ultimately producing fewer jobs, there must be either basic economic structural changes or the institution of a guaranteed income for all, according to noted economist Robert Theobald who spoke here last October. Theobald contends that man is living in a world of economic transition. The major principles dominating this transition will be that machines rather than men will take up work openings and that the activity of men will be devoted to new forms of work and leisure. Noting that the rate of demand is increasing faster than the rate of supply ever has, Theobald says that new methods of automation are being created to meet greater demands. Automation can handle many jobs better than men, Theobald maintains. “We are now entering an age when machines can toil for us, and it is therefore surely grotesque that we continue to insist on competing with them for the ever-shrinking amounts of toil that are available. We cannot free man from toil unless we achieve fundamental changes in our technique of distributing resources and also in Western man’s view of what gives value to his life.”

The guaranteed income, or as Theobald calls it “Basic Economic Security,” now enters his thesis. Theobald puts forth tentative figures such as $1,000 for every adult and $600 for every child in the family. To institute such a program in the United States would cost from $12 to $20 billion dollars. This amount of money would not be hard to obtain, he continues. Anyway, the money would be put directly back into the economy. This theory “advances the idea that every individual is worthy of certain fundamental rights, including an income sufficient to live on with dignity.” It would also lead to needed limitations on waste.
