Wildcat Sniglets: A Davidson Lexicon

Not long ago a book entitled Sniglets appeared, claiming to solve a real problem in American vocabulary. A sniglet is
a word for something that needed a name but previously did not have one. Their classic example: what is the
crusty stuff at the top of a ketchup bottle? Flen, they answered. A necessary service this was, but the sniglet
makers overlooked fair Davidson.

MORE OR LESS BY ANN MEADOR

For too long we have struggled to describe the phenomena which make Davidson what it is, and it’s time to
remedy the problem. Here we present the 1985 More or Less Wildcat Lexicon.

_indulgence pellets, n. pl. The round things the Infirmary puts in vials and sells to you for a dollar, often
mistakenly called Dimetapp, Sudafed, Actifed, Motrin, Codeine
flagrance, n. The smell of Belk, Sentelle, and Watts
drainer, n. A green card from the Comptroller in your mailbox: so named for the slow, inexorable effect it has
on one’s checkbook
hirsutia, n. The big wazoo of hair in a dorm shower drain; ex.: “This hirsutia is making me gag!”
gunge, n. The stuff around dorm room sink faucets; becomes chronic gunge as year progresses
Meetzing, n. The process of covering an entire campus with bricks (from Grover Meetze, brick aficionado and head of Davidson
Building and Grounds)
spongeum, n. The filmy gunk on eating house tables; ex.: “Ugh, this spongeum stuck my plate to the table!”
sinsneak, n. The person involved in fellowship but not cohabitation, seen snarfing from the room of a helpmate before 6:30
a.m.
lock-out, n. The first-year, first-term sensation of realizing everyone else at your table takes Humanities, but you don’t; not to
be confused with the Rusk lock-in
gradkin, n. One who obtains a diploma from Davidson and gets a job here within two years. One who returns
after two years is called a nostalgigrad

Now, Torrence - if you could sum up your life, all that has ever been important to you, your values,
favorite dinner dessert — in 2 words — what would you say?
Torrence, as everyone knows, you can easily categorize all people on this planet into two groups. The leaders, or those
that have lots of money. Sometimes that is. Torrence, where do you fit into this universal scheme? Uh... Yessir, Sometimes
that is.
