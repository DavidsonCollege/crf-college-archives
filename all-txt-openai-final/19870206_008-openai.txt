MEANWHILE, a gaggle of freshmen is being advised:
“Font gives that Papal Bull! If you don’t
have your social dues paid, you’ll be socially desolate.
You have to belong to ANY house.”

If you've ever wanted to get above it all, then the Air
Force ROTC Flight Screening Program may be for you.
You'll learn the basics of flight through flying lessons in
small aircraft.

It's an additional program for Air Force ROTC cadets
who can qualify to become pilots. With your Air Force
ROTC training, it's your first step to pilot training.

You can do something about your desire to fly... with
the best. Talk to your campus Air Force ROTC
representative today.
