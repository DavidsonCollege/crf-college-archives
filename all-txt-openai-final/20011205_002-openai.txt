**Forum sparks debate on homosexuality**

hoped would spark students to think about one central question: “How do you treat people when they are different than
you are?” He said college is the best time to decide that question, because “This is a small little pond.
The world is a lot bigger.”

As the son of a conservative Pentecostal minister, Palmer said he knows what it’s like to feel ashamed. He didn’t
come out of the closet until age 30, when he was married with two children. Today, his mother still doesn’t
tell any of her friends that her son is homosexual.

Palmer asked GSA president Shea and other homosexuals to share their experiences before and during their time at Davidson. Shea
remembered Christmas during her freshman year, when she received seven Bibles from hallmates. Those times were hard, she said, but
things seem to be improving. “Davidson is getting better,” she told the audience. “It was not always the most friendly
place. There are many times I’d go back to my room bawling. I prayed I would be straight.”

Another student said coming out of the closet during his sophomore year was the best decision he ever made. Although
some disapprove of his homosexuality, he’s never encountered any backlash. “I’m so glad this (forum) happened before I graduated,” he
said. “I think it’s a huge step forward.”

A freshman said he’s been public about his homosexuality for six years and has grown to be comfortable with who
he is. Some of his classmates, however, haven’t made the adjustment. “Guys on my hall have a difficult time talking
to me or making eye contact with me,” he said. “(But) for the most part, things have been great here.”

A non-homosexual freshman told about threatening phone calls she received recently because of her close friendship with Shea. “There are
a lot of things that happen on this campus that you don’t know about,” she said.

Shea said on Tuesday that the forum was only the latest example of the growing success of the Gay Student
Alliance chapter at Davidson. While previous homosexual organizations died out due to lack of participation, GSA today has 45 people
on its mailing list, as well as involvement from College President Bobby Vagt and Chaplain Rob Spach. She said its
success shows that Davidson is doing its best to create a welcoming environment for people of all backgrounds.

“I think diversity is something that everyone struggles with,” she said. “It’s not exclusively a Davidson thing. I really think
Davidson as a whole, particularly the faculty and staff, are trying hard to make Davidson a welcoming place for just
about anybody.”

**Houses will be warned before parties are shut down**

enforcing it incorrectly. Some officers had interpreted it to mean that Patterson Court had the same quiet hours as the
dorms and it was their responsibility to enforce these hours; others were more lax, leading to a discrepancy in enforcement
that confused and frustrated many students. In the past, some officers have shut down all parties promptly at midnight. Although
the text of the proposal for future enforcement has not yet been finalized, it seems that, in the future, this
will not be the case unless a noise complaint is received.

Houses will receive a warning before their party is shut down due to noise complaints. Officers will remain at the
party until the students have turned the music down to acceptable levels; if the volume rises after the officer departs,
the party may then be shut down. There have been no changes to the alcohol policy, and houses that are
investigated for noise complaints may end up getting sanctioned for violating the alcohol policy if the officer observes anything out
of place. Officers will not enter fraternities or eating houses unless there has been a complaint, however.Student concern that any
change in policy or in enforcement would encroach upon the rights of students who want to study or sleep during
these hours. “We do live in a community, we need to compromise.” He stated that there will be no change
to the Red Book and no impact on residence hall quiet hours. He hopes that the new enforcement policy will
enable all students to be accommodated, whether their activity of choice at midnight is socializing, studying, or sleeping. “[The proposal]
allows people who want to party and people who don’t want to party to be able to do what they
want to do,” he said. Additionally, Watson, the Public Safety representative in SGA, will work with Public Safety to maintain
the lines of communication between students and officers. Patterson called the result of the committee’s work “a triumph of the
process,” saying, “students were given the chance to prove their worth [by working to change the policy] and I think
[the proposal] is a very positive outcome.”

First Lilly scholars named
Press Release
College Communications

Five Davidson College seniors—Joel F. Hanisek, Richard B. Vinson, Elisabeth M. Summerlin, Elizabeth Marie Melchionna, and Sarah E. Schmidt—were recently
selected as the first Lilly Scholars by Davidson’s Lilly Program for the Theological Exploration of Vocation. The Lilly Scholarship is
intended to interest more students in considering ordained ministry as a possible vocation. Tim Beach-Verhey, program director, explained, “We’re trying
to reach out to students who might not otherwise be thinking of seminary, and who show gifts for ministry.” Each
award includes $20,000 for financial assistance during the scholar’s final year at Davidson and first year at theological seminary. Because
seminary is a three-year process, the Lilly Scholarship gives students a “free year” to explore that as a graduate option
they may not have otherwise considered.

Scholar Joel Hanisek confirmed that the Lilly program has already led him to consider the idea of vocation more seriously.
“This scholarship challenges me to take seriously the idea of vocation, and to seek ways to connect the various passions
of my life within a framework of integrity and faithfulness,” he said. Candidates for the scholarship are nominated by fellow
students, faculty, staff, and local clergy. Nominees are invited to submit an application highlighting academic performance, campus leadership, commitment to
community service, a sense of a genuine faith journey, and a curiosity about ministry. This year’s winners were selected from
a pool of forty-four nominees.

Throughout the rest of this academic year, the new Lilly Scholars will participate in a non-credit, semi-weekly seminar led by
Beach-Verhey to explore issues of vocation and ordained ministry. They will read texts such as "Who Will Go For Us:
An Invitation to Ordained Ministry" by Dennis Campbell. They will talk with church pastors, as well as individuals who have
completed a master of divinity degree and now work as pastoral counselors, chaplains, or in religious leadership outside the church.
They will also meet representatives of seminary schools and current seminary students to talk about their experiences.

The Lilly Scholars have already met with visiting lecturer James Fowler, Candler Professor of Theology and Human Development at Emory
University, who talked at Davidson on vocation and the challenges of practical postmodern faith. The Lilly Program at Davidson is
funded by a grant from the Lilly Foundation, and seeks to foster the development of faith through service, and to
promote the idea that faith applied to the workplace can lead to a more fulfilling career. The Lilly Foundation made
awards to 20 colleges nationwide willing to explore the contention that people who align their beliefs, values, and principles with
their work find it more meaningful, and manifest solidarity and compassion through it. Davidson has crafted its four-year Lilly program
to encompass students, faculty, staff, townspeople, and alumni of all faiths and religious persuasions.
