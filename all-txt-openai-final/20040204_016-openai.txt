In what is becoming more than just a trend, the Davidson basketball team split another pair of games this week, falling in the final seconds at Georgia Southern before rebounding at home against UNC Greensboro in the weekend match-up in Belk Arena. Both games represented solid all-around efforts by the Wildcats, but the charity stripe would prove to be the difference between a win and a loss.

In a snow-delayed game at Georgia Southern on Wednesday, Davidson looked to register its first road victory in 10 tries this season against the first-place Eagles. The defensive intensity, an area of stress for head coach Bob McKillop and his staff throughout the early part of the season, was solid for the Wildcats throughout, as Davidson held the Eagles to a paltry 34.8 percent field goal percentage and their lowest scoring output of the season. Despite the strong play on the defensive end, Georgia Southern used opportunistic free-throw shooting and a 15-3 run early in the second half to take a commanding 14-point lead. Still, the ’Cats fought back and climbed to within one at 61-60 on a Nick Booker ’05 tip-in with under a minute to play. A defensive stop by the Wildcats gave Davidson the ball with a chance to win, but a crucial turnover handed the ball right back to the Eagles, who made one of two free throws to take a 62-60 lead. A desperation shot by Terrell Ivory ’04 was blocked as time expired, and the Wildcats were sent to their eleventh straight road defeat.

The key difference in the game came from the charity stripe, however, where Davidson shot an uncharacteristic 61 percent on 23 attempts. Meanwhile, Georgia Southern converted on 74 percent of their 31 tries from the foul line. “If it weren’t for a few missed free throws,” commented McKillop after the game, “we could have easily won that game against Georgia Southern. Free throws are such a small point of the game, yet they can really cost you as well. All of our conference losses have come to division-leading teams in Chattanooga, Charleston, ETSU, and Georgia Southern, and we have been in every one of those down to the final minute. So, every little thing matters in those games, and that’s why free throws are so important for us.”

In the weekend match-up with UNC Greensboro, the Wildcats looked to improve upon an equally impressive nine-game win streak at home, as well as a five-game streak over the Spartans that dates back to the 2001 season. The game was tight for much of the first half, with Davidson trailing 24-23 at the break, but the Wildcats opened it up early in the second on the heels of a 16-6 run. The Spartans hung around for much of the game, closing to within four points with under eight minutes remaining, but stellar Wildcat play on both ends proved to be too much for UNC-G in Davidson’s 80-69 victory.

For the game, the Wildcats shot a season-high 51 percent from the field, including 67 percent in the second half and 44 percent from beyond the arc. Every member of the Davidson line-up got into the scoring action as well, with six different players going for double figures on the night. Ian Johnson ’06 led all scorers with 14 points, and Brendan Winters ’06 extended his double-figure streak to 19 games with 11 points. Winters needed every bit of the clock to reach double figures, though, as he scored all of his points in the final ten minutes, including his final two with under a minute to play. Just as encouraging as the crisp offense, however, was the stellar defensive effort by the Wildcats.

Men's basketball finally gets road win in victory over The Citadel

The Wildcats, previously 0-10 in road games this season, finally registered a win away from Belk Arena last night, defeating The Citadel 67-49. Brendan Winters ’06 led all scorers with 18 points on the night, extending his double-figures scoring streak to 20 games. Matt McKillop ’06 chipped in 15 points on 5-7 shooting from beyond the arc, and Logan Kosmalski ’05 was the only other Wildcat to reach double figures with 11. For the game, Davidson made 12 of 24 three-pointers, shooting a season-high 50 percent from beyond the arc, and held The Citadel to just 33 percent shooting. Davidson also continued its dominance on the boards, finishing with a 42-24 rebounding edge.

Women move to second in conference

With a 69-50 win late Tuesday night against Appalachian State, the women’s basketball team improved to 13-8 on the season and moved to second in the Southern Conference standings. The win was the first in six games against the Mountaineers, as the ’Cats lost on a buzzer-beater in their last matchup, 80-81. Davidson came out strong on both ends of the court, with tough man-to-man defense leading to key transition points. Ashley Hallsted ’04 led the way on the offensive end with 20 points; despite shooting poorly in the previous two games, she managed to create quality shots off the drive.

With one minute remaining in the first half, Courtney Laird ’04 put Davidson up 37-17 with a three-pointer. The Wildcats looked a bit sloppy in the opening minutes of the second half with several early turnovers, but the team managed to settle down and even extend the lead to as much as 32 points. Unfortunately for App. State, Aisha Bryant ’04 seemed to be doing all of the work. Her one-woman show could not hold up against the 14-player rotation that head coach Annette Watts employed, bringing in every player off the bench. Watts did the same thing in Saturday’s away game against Georgia Southern, a 57-47 victory. Six seemed to be the lucky number this week for the ’Cats, as this win was their first in Statesboro in six years. As Watts remarked, “This is a hard place to win, and it sure feels good to do it.”

Davidson’s stifling defense in the first half held Georgia Southern to only 13 points, shooting a dismal 16% from the floor. The lead grew in the second half to as much as 21 points on a jumper by Tia Washington ’07; however, the Eagles refused to go away and brought the lead down to just four points in the final minute at 51-47. The Wildcats then stepped up and made their next six free throws to seal the win. Meghan Bryant led Davidson with a near double-double, scoring 14 points and grabbing nine rebounds. She made her way into the Davidson record books Wednesday night with her 126th block, becoming the women’s player with the most blocks in Davidson history. Teammate Courtney Laird was not far behind, tallying her 100th block, making her only the third Wildcat to reach 100.

Unfortunately, the team’s performance was nowhere near record book proportions, as they played poorly and lost to Western Carolina 75-70. As Laird commented, “We didn’t communicate well on defense and never really got into a flow on offense.” The first half was extremely close, as the Catamounts...

PLAY OF THE WEEK: Swimmer

Going into their last meet of the regular season, the men’s swim team needed a great performance. Staring at three weeks of practice before heading off to the conference championships, they also needed some motivation. That motivation came from senior captains Robert Koch and Charlie Hunter, who combined to win three individual events and lead the ’Cats to a 153-76 victory over VMI. Koch set season-best times in his victories in both the 100 and 200 free. Meanwhile, Hunter crushed his opponents in the 100 fly, finishing five seconds ahead of the next VMI swimmer. The win gives Davidson some inspiration to continue to work hard until the CAA Championships on February 18.
