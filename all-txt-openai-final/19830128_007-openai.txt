**Seven Hares Sacrificed During Fete**

Gods appeased and allow the Davidson Monthly to publish

Nearly 113 years ago, the dedicated Presbyterian literati of 33-year-old Davidson College began publishing The Davidson Monthly, a small magazine devoted to “Science, Literature, and Art.” It was elegantly printed, and on the cover of the first issue is a delicate engraving that shows a hand from the clouds pouring oil into a burning Aladdin’s lamp that rests on a book. Though from 1897 it was The Davidson Magazine, the periodical continued, consistently in peacetime, spasmodically in times of war or financial troubles, until 1930. You can find all the issues in the Davidsoniana room of the library.

The ordinary dull routine and unbroken monotony of college life proved itself on the 23rd of February susceptible of some variation. A stranger to the place would have thought that some mistake had been made in our Hostetter’s Almanac and we were celebrating Washington’s birthday on the 23rd instead of the 22nd. Mother Earth had been covered with snow by the kind elements the night before, and it appeared to the sedate students and sober bookworms a good idea to petition the Faculty for a holiday; with the avowed purpose of hunting rabbits, “and-so-forth.” (From the diversity of pursuits engaged in, we presume that the greater number subscribed to the latter qualification.) Much to the surprised delight of the petitioners, a formal answer came to the effect that the doctors, in consideration of the tempting opportunities afforded their disciples for recreation, would suspend recitations for the day, with the proviso, however, that the former should be furnished something like a tithe of the spoils of the latter. In consequence of the tickling of ears caused by this information, the cool air was rent with shouts, and the campus reverberated with vibratory waves in the air set in motion by many a stentorian lung.

But we have gotten a little ahead of ourselves in our enthusiasm. Before we were relieved of suspense by the considerate response above referred to, the impetuosity so natural to human beings of our tender years led about “three score and ten” to divide themselves equally into parties, and prepare for a snow contest. A line was accordingly drawn (with something like the same idea with which Mason & Dixon’s was laid off) which was to keep the contestants from a hand-to-hand encounter. The first hard, well-pressed ball was succeeded by dozens and the fight began in earnest. Words will not suffice to tell of the whitened locks, bruised noses and eyes, dirty faces, sprained limbs, and saturated garments, which were consequent upon many a brave, well-sustained charge. Never did knight for fair lady in the ages of chivalry lay lance in rest with a firmer determination to do or — run. Neither side gained the victory, and, much to the delight of the poor fellows who had many a time and oft been overcome by brute force, and placed none too gently into an earthy couch, the hitherto contending parties united in one—and, horror! made at the lookers-on with a most terrible yell. Well, it need not do extraordinary credit to the dignity of the disconcerted spectators to tell how, Seniors and Fresh together, skedaddled to a place of refuge.

To make a long matter short (to tell the truth, the latter part of the last paragraph has not called up any very pleasant associations in my mind) I will close by saying that seven innocent hares were sacrificed to the day’s amusements—and for aught I know graced the boards of our worthy professors, according to Art. I, Agreement.

Doubtless many of our subscribers are becoming anxious to see a specimen copy of the “Davidson Monthly.” We fully intended, when our prospectus was issued, to publish a January number; but our subscription list was not large enough to justify our commencing so arduous a task as publishing a magazine. We hope our readers will excuse our delay, and we promise them now that no effort shall be wanting on our part to make our little monthly interesting and such as a college magazine should be. We commence in this number to give the history of our College. The first article in the present issue is a sketch of the first...Attempt of the good people of Western North Carolina to establish an institution of learning in their midst, which eventually led to the foundation of Davidson College. Founded in the prayers and by the earnest labors of Presbyterians, and having gradually risen to a rank among the best of our Southern Colleges, her history will, no doubt, be both interesting and encouraging to those who feel an interest in her welfare. We have just received a very entertaining letter from our friend “Literatus,” who seems, from the tenor of his remarks, to have assumed a most appropriate name. We take pleasure in publishing his epistle in this number, and we most cordially extend to the gentleman an invitation to write for our magazine. We will gladly favor our readers with all such “learned discourses” as he may choose to forward us. The terms on which we propose to publish are as follows:

Single copy Ten months, — — $2.00.
Six copies Ten months, — — $10.00.
Twelve copies Ten months, — — $18.00.
Specimen copies forwarded to any address at 25 cents each. All orders must be accompanied with cash; otherwise, they will not be noticed.

Mehta Concert: A Review
Bach and Mehta in the concert hall
By MIGUEL ABREU

Last Monday evening at 7:30 the tension ran high in the packed Love Auditorium. In the side aisles, cameramen made the final adjustments of their equipment. The crowd anticipated a unique musical performance: Zubin Mehta, music director of the New York Philharmonic, conducting an all-Bach program featuring William Workman, leading baritone of the Frankfurt Opera Company, and Joseph Robinson, principal oboist of the New York Philharmonic.

The opening Sinfonia from the Easter Oratorio plunged the audience into the realm of Bach’s most luscious and alleviating sacred music. The impressive Robinson performed his slow solo passages impeccably with a pure and flowing sound that markedly contributed to the enchanting force of the piece.

The program became more serious with the Cantata No. 82 “Ich habe genug” (“I have enough”). Workman’s solo displayed the full array of his smooth and expressive voice that had not fully come out during the open-to-students dress rehearsal earlier in the day. The cantata allowed him to reveal his outstanding technical abilities as well as his resolution to exhibit the meaning of the text. But he reached his peak in the intensely moving and descriptive Cantata No. 56 “Ich will den Kreuzstab gerne tragen” (“I would like to carry the cross”), making every possible effort to portray the deeper sufferings of man; while at the same time he engages in a beautiful, energetic yet gentle dialogue with the oboe.

The concluding chorale section featured a thirty-member chamber chorus selected from the Oratorio Singers of Charlotte. The surprisingly good performance of this semi-professional ensemble should be attributed primarily to Mary Nell Saunders, director of the Oratorio Singers since Don Plott’s retirement in December 1980. She succeeded in preparing her singers to meet the challenge of both Cantatas Nos. 56 and 50. The overwhelming and all-encompassing sound created by Mehta’s masterful unification of the orchestra and the chorus gradually lifted the audience to ethereal heights. In this majestic, somber, and deeply emotional ending rests some of Bach’s most “spiritual” inspiration, which might explain the few seconds of silence between the last chord and the applause.

Cantata No. 50 states some of the essential aspects of Bach’s style and power. In the final piece, he demonstrates his mastery of the fugue form, his logical and almost mathematical approach to music, a combination of solid compositional craftsmanship with instrumental and vocal virtuosity, and his peaceful and refreshing quality. The different sections of the chorus echo one another and subtly blend with the orchestra, bringing a sparkling and exciting character to the piece. When a passionate Zubin Mehta conducts such a magnificent composition, no one will be surprised to learn that he received a standing ovation and was called back for an “encore” of the Cantata No. 50.

The well-balanced program enabled the audience to appreciate fully not only Bach’s captivating and exalting sacred music, but the specific points forts of the performing forces.
