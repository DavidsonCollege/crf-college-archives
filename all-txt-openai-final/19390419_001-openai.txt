**Earl Mellen’s Orchestra Will Return To Davidson For Year’s Final Dances**

**Friday Night Formal to Be Featured by Annual Military Figure**

**THREE DANCES IN SET**

**Popular Maestro Will Appear Here for Third Time**

Earl Mellen and his “Melodies by Mellen” Orchestra will return to Davidson College to play for the spring dance set
May 12 and 13, the final dances of the year. This will mark the third visit of Mellen to Davidson.
He first played for the last of the old Junior Speaking sets in the spring of 1937, and returned to
grace the fall set of last year.

**Three Dances**

There will be three dances to this year’s set, beginning with the regular Friday night formal. Saturday afternoon a tea
dance will be held, and the weekend will be concluded with an informal Saturday night. The Friday night affair will
last from 10 until 2; the tea dance from 4 to 6:30, and the informal from 8:30 to 12.

The Friday night dance will be sponsored by Scabbard and Blade, honorary military fraternity, who will present their annual Military
Ball. The figure will be composed of members of the society and their dates.

Mellen’s orchestra is composed of 12 musicians whose average age is 23. He is very popular among southern schools, fulfilling
most of his engagements south of the Mason-Dixon line. He has recently completed a long engagement at the Tantilla Gardens
of Richmond, Va. At his last two engagements here he received the hearty praise of all members of the student
body who attended the dances.

**Student Show Of Local Art Draws Throng**

**Faculty Committee Judges Three-Day Exhibit**

Last Monday afternoon the Student Art Exhibit opened at 1 o’clock, and large crowds of students and townspeople thronged through
the rooms on the ground floor of the Eumenean Hall admiring the artistic work of the 15 students whose drawings
were displayed there. At 3:30 yesterday afternoon the committee for judging the best paintings, composed of Dr. C. R. Harding,
Dr. K. J. Foreman, Professor Chalmers Davidson, Professor H. T. Lilly, and Mrs. Philip Peyton, passed their decisions on the
best of five types: those in oil, ink, pencil, watercolors, and charcoal. The exhibit closed this afternoon at 5 o’clock
and the student votes, as well as those of others, will be counted and posted in the near future.

**Prizes Offered**

The college itself took far greater interest in this exhibit than in those held in past years as was shown
by the large number of students that filled the hall throughout the hours when the exhibit was on display. This
year cash prizes were offered by the college to those students whose drawings were chosen best by the committee and
the student body. Some of the contributors have been asked to lend their works to the Mint Museum in Charlotte.

Some of the kinds of works entered are surrealisms, portraitures, landscapes, sketches of buildings, torsos, still life, and many others.
The painting that is apparently drawing the most attention and most favorable criticism from the student body is a wild
surrealism by Wally Scherer entitled, “Davidsonian’s Dream.”

**Maestro Popular**

Earl Mellen will return again to Davidson for the third time. He has been secured by the Pan-Hellenic Council to
furnish music for the Spring dances in May.

**No-Yong Park Speaks About War In China**

**Democratic Nations Will Face Economic Ruin If Japan Wins War**

Democratic nations in the future will face economic and possibly physical ruin if Japan wins the present Asiatic war, declared
Dr. No-Yong Park to an audience of approximately 300 in Chambers Auditorium last Wednesday evening. After showing the fallacies of
six arguments the Japanese have put up to show the necessity of the war, the speaker, who is a native
of Manchuria, pointed out that a victory by Nippon, while causing a temporary rise in U.S. exports, would eventually drive
American markets from Asia. He explained that Oriental cheap labor will undermine America’s home markets. Should Washington put up a
tariff wall to prevent this, the Japanese would forbid imports of American goods, and the effect would be the same.

**Democratic Victory**

On the other hand, Dr. Park pointed out, a Chinese victory will probably be one for democracy, since there is
where democratic sympathy lies. A strong nationalist Chinese state would also serve as a bulwark against Russia and Japan. However,
he warned, should neither nation win, Russia might reap the benefits by both nations turning Communist.

The Manchurian closed by discussing the part the United States must play in this prevention. He declared that this nation

**N. C. C. P. A. Meet Planned**

The biggest convention in the history of the North Carolina Collegiate Press Association is being planned now. College newspaper heads
who attend will register from 2:00 until 5:00, Thursday afternoon, May 4, at the O’Henry Hotel in Greensboro, N.C. Program
arrangements will bring to the conference several leaders in publications, including Mr. C. B. Driscoll, nationally known columnist for McNaught
Syndicate.

The editors of the Davidsonian and the Magazine will probably attend along with their respective business managers. The conference was
held last year in Charlotte.

**Seniors To Meet With Professors**

**Field Day to Be Inaugurated Thursday; Athletic Events Planned**

The Senior class will sponsor a Senior-Faculty field day Thursday afternoon and night beginning with athletic events and ending with
a barbecue. The program committee has arranged for sporting events to begin at 1:30 with matches in bowling and tennis.
At 3:30 the Seniors will challenge the Faculty in a game of softball. The two groups will retire to the
golf course at 6:00 where the horseshoe matches will take place. After the matches are over the entire company will
be treated to a barbecue supper. Following the supper the group will have an informal party around the fireside with
songs, and probably skits presented by both students and faculty.

**Committeemen**

Plans for this program are being arranged by a committee of three men—Shaw Smith, and Oscar Armstrong with Ovid Bell
acting as chairman of the committee. The athletic events and matches will be under the management of Charlie Sample and
Pete Whittle. This is the first time that such a plan for getting the Senior class and the Faculty together
has ever been put into effect. Both parties are endeavoring to come to a more complete understanding of the other’s
problems whereby more wholehearted cooperation may be given between the two groups. If this Senior-Faculty field day is terminated by
success, there are indications that it will become an annual affair on the Davidson campus.

**Frosh Select New Officers**

Members of the rising sophomore class began voting Tuesday for their next year’s class officers, after candidates had been nominated
at a special meeting of the freshmen Monday after chapel. For president, the committee chose Ed Lucas, George Marsh, Gene
Shannon, and Ralph Stair. Bill Sprunt, Tommy Yarborough, and Albert Winn were nominated from the floor. Frank Caldwell, Arch [Continued

**Taylor, McClintock**

Gales McClintock of Charlotte, N.C., was elected president of the Athletic Association on the third balloting. Jimmy Hogg of Denver,
Colo., and Jack Abels of High Point, N.C., were elected first and second vice-president respectively on the first balloting. Don
Bell was elected Secretary-Treasurer on the fourth balloting.

Gales McClintock of Beta Theta Pi social fraternity has been very prominent in extra-curricular activities: he is president of the
Junior Class, is next year’s representative of Beta Theta Pi on the Pan-Hellenic Council, is an end on the varsity
football team, member of the Commerce Club, and prominent in Intramurals. After the second balloting Jim Cowan had a substantial
lead over Gales McClintock. However, in the following ballot McClintock defeated Cowan.

**Concert To Be Given**

The annual spring concert of the Davidson College Glee Club will be given Wednesday night, April 26, at 8:15 P.M.
The program will be under the direction of Professor Thane McDonald. The program will consist of a group of sacred
and secular numbers by the glee club and the glee club quartet will also render several numbers. Don L. Davidson,
who has accompanied the glee club for the past two years, will also play a group of piano solos. J.
Harper Beall, Jr., will sing the incidental solos in the closing group by the glee club. This concert will be
open to all students and to holders of season tickets. Others will be charged the nominal admission.

**Stone Gives Endowment To College**

**Doctor Leaves Gift of 25,000 Dollars to Davidson**

Davidson College has recently received a large gift of approximately $25,000 from the late Dr. A. H. Stone, a Davidson
alumnus. Dr. Stone, Class of 1896, died on March 17 leaving an estate of approximately $75,000 to $80,000 to be
divided between Davidson College, Barium Springs Orphanage, and the Orange Presbytery. He specified that the Davidson College donation was for
the purpose of creating ministerial scholarships. A copy of his will has just been received by Mr. F. L. Jackson,
Treasurer.

**Summary**

This latest gift adds considerably to the effort Davidson is making to raise funds. Mr. M. G. Lockhart, director of
the Centennial Fund, summarizes the gifts of the past three years as follows, “Davidson College”has, in the past three years,
made substantial progress in her program of preparation for a greater Second Century of service. June, 1937, was a record
closing for the Institution, with plans made to increase her endowment and provide adequate buildings on the campus for her
present and future needs. “Since that time the first unit of the building program has been completed. A handsome new
infirmary, a gift of Mr. and Mrs. William Y. Preyer of Greensboro, N.C., and New York, now serves the college
and its student body. A fund of $15,000, subscribed largely by former students of the Old North Carolina Medical College,
has been set up in honor of Dr. J. P. Munroe of Charlotte. This fund is known as the J.
P. Munroe Endowment Fund.” [Continued on Page Six]

Dr. Beckerath Gives Talk On Foreign Policy

Presents Inside Facts on Result of Munich Agreement in Europe

Dr. Von Beckerath, an eminent authority on international relations, lectured on The Aftermath of the Munich Agreement at the regular
chapel period last Tuesday.

Dr. Beckerath first gave the various reactions to the Munich agreement by the nations which were concerned with it. The
immediate reaction, he said, was prevalent throughout all Europe both in the totalitarian states and democratic states and was one
of a sigh of relief that immediate war had been averted. In addition to this general feeling, each state reacted
in a different way. Germany and Italy thought that at last it was a readjustment of the territorial injustice dealt
her at the end of the war; and felt that it was a decided triumph over the democratic powers.

Democracies Afraid

England defended her part in the Munich agreement as she said it was a measure to insure permanent peace. She
also feared that her empire would not stand the stress of a long war again. France also thought that she
was unprepared to wage war. Dr. Beckerath said that France would fight against territorial invasion but could never fight for
an imperialistic venture. The public opinion in the United States condemned the actions of France and England as a cowardly
retreat and surrender to the higher ideals. Russia has kept comparatively quiet through the trouble and the press has not
committed itself.

The agreement at Munich marks the first time in history that a reshuffling of power distribution has come about without
a war. The present condition existing today is one of a chaotic danger signal. The first was the rise of
Germany and Italy. Some statesmen advocated crushing these states before they could offer any strong resistance. This was not done
because of the attitude among the masses against plunging into another war. The course of events will be determined by
the actions of individuals, Hitler, Mussolini, and Daladier, and no one is in a position to forecast the outcome.

Condition Perilous

The present condition is little better than a new kind of warfare in which the Democracies are racing against the
Totalitarian states to [Continued on Page Six].

Converse and Davidson Give French Plays

Davidson Boys and Converse Girls Star

Three plays were presented by the combined French Circles of Converse and Davidson to an audience in Chambers auditorium Monday
night. The first number on the program was a short curtain-raiser, “Cupidon, Dentiste,” presented by the Converse group. The scene
was laid in a dentist's office and the plot is concerned with the amazing cure of Jacques Lefrance, who was
relieved of a terrific toothache by the advent of a beautiful young lady. As they leave the dentist's room hand-in-hand,
Jacques wonders whether cupid is not his superior.

Taking part in this production were Nancy Lee as Jacques Lefrance, Martha Cannon as Paulette, West Didier as the dentist,
Zimmerman as the fat gentleman, Marguerite Christie as the old lady, and Nancy Lawrence as the maid.

Following this came another short play entitled “Une Partie de Bridge,” produced by the Davidson Cercle. A doctor called in
to an ailing bridge player gives him morphine to quiet his cries of pain and plays the hand himself. Characters
were: Sid Crane [Continued on Page Six].

Leaders Of Band Named

The Davidson Symphonic Band elected its officers for the next year at a recent meeting. Burton Johnson was chosen president;
Warren Ludlam, vice-president; and Norris Erb, secretary-treasurer.

Burton Johnson, from Lenoir, is a sergeant in the R.O.T.C. and plays the Susaphone in the band. Warren Ludlam, from
Meridian, Miss., is a member of the Phi Delta Theta social fraternity, an assistant in Bible, is president of Eta
Sigma Phi, classical fraternity, and plays the flute in the band. Norris Erb, from Badin, is a member of Pi
Kappa Phi social fraternity, is an active participant in intramural sports, and plays the trombone in the band.
