The Board of Trustees approved a 14.5 percent increase in tuition and fees for the school year 1986-87 at their
meeting Friday, Feb. 21. Discussion over the President’s proposed budget started Nov. 1, 1985, and the approved increase reflects various
changes in budget caused by what Comptroller Robert Davidson identifies as “external factors,” including major maintenance concerns, computer purchases, and
employment of additional faculty. This tuition increase is the largest in six years. College president John Kuykendall acknowledged the increase
as “substantial” but justified in providing such “worthy and necessary factors in assuring a liberal arts education of first quality.”
Davidson regards such an increase in budget as generally unpredictable and related to a continuation of changes in external factors.
No particular cause can be singled out for this year’s increase. Davidson said that the tuition and fees usually increase
on an average of eight to 10 percent each year and that perhaps the school’s effort to keep costs down
may have caught up with the budget. In terms of financial aid, Davidson regards the college as “determined to meet
aid.” Included in the budget is an increase of 33 percent in financial aid provisions. The Office of Financial Aid
assures the continuation of its policy to meet each student’s demonstrated financial need and does not anticipate any problems in
supporting additional assistance. Major concerns which the Board says cannot wait any longer and for which the budget hopes to
provide include repairs of the roof and basement of the Chambers building, the renovation of worn dormitories, the purchase of
both hardware and software for academic use, and the employment of additional staff for instruction and maintenance of the computers.
The Trustees also hope that the college will be able to apply a portion of the new budget toward the
re-establishment of a one to 12 faculty/student ratio.

**Personal computers of NCAA ticket availability, prices cause confusion**

**By DAVID WILLIAMS**

The Athletic Department and the Wildcat Club obtained and distributed approximately 440 single-game tickets this week among students, faculty, and
staff for tonight’s 9:37 NCAA tournament match-up between Davidson and Kentucky in the Charlotte Coliseum. According to Wildcat Club Director
Sandy Carnegie, the NCAA originally allotted Davidson a number of book tickets for all of the Charlotte games of the
NCAA tournament, because Davidson is co-host with UNCC of the Charlotte games. The Wildcat Club sold virtually all these tickets
last fall as part of the Davidson basketball season ticket package. After Davidson gained an automatic bid to the NCAA
tournament by beating University of Tennessee-Chattanooga for the Southern Conference Championship, the NCAA automatically allotted Davidson 250 book tickets, at
a price of $45 each, as part of standard procedure. These 250 tickets originally covered all the tournament games played
in Charlotte. “But late Monday morning,” Carnegie said, “we were told that our...”

---Allotment from the NCAA was 250 single-game tickets, costing $15 each. Athletic Director Kit Morris said, “We decided to distribute
the 250 tickets evenly between our ‘internal’ constituency — students, faculty, and staff — and our ‘external’ constituency — alumni,
season ticket holders, and top donors.” Athletic officials decided to allocate 50 tickets for basketball players and coaches, 100 tickets
for the ‘internal’ constituency, and another 100 for the ‘external’ constituency. According to Morris, “We had originally discussed a first-come,
first-serve ticket distribution for faculty, students, and staff, but Math Professor J.B. Stroud, the faculty athletics representative, recommended we distribute
them on a lottery basis.” Athletic officials heeded Stroud’s recommendation and decided to hold a sign-up for a ticket lottery
this past Monday, which would randomly distribute the tickets. Over 680 students, faculty, and staff signed up for the ticket
lottery. On Tuesday, ticket office personnel posted initial results of the lottery, which showed that 100 tickets had been allocated
for those requesting tickets. However, according to Carnegie, “In the meantime, we started trying to wheel and deal with other
schools to do what we could to get more tickets. We also contacted NCAA officials and Coliseum officials, and they
said we could get more tickets.” By Wednesday, another 340 students, faculty, and staff were allotted tickets for a total
of 440 tickets granted out of 681 requests. “We are lucky to know Tom Scott, who is the Tournament Coordinator
in Charlotte and Athletic Director Emeritus of Davidson,” Morris said. He added that Scott, who is also a former chairman
of the NCAA tournament committee, arranged for Davidson to obtain an initial 250 $15 single-game tickets, rather than the original
$45 book tickets covering all the games. “He also was able to secure for us additional single-game tickets,” Morris said.
Carnegie said, “I feel that those people who were not able to get tickets from the ticket office will most
likely be able to find tickets before the game.” He noted that by the time Davidson plays Friday night, three
losers will already be determined, and that the fans of these teams will be more than willing to sell their
tickets to Davidson fans. Morris said, “I think it’s always dangerous to promise what you can’t deliver, and we didn’t
want to raise hopes that we could accommodate all the desires of the community when we couldn’t. I think we
have made a significant and substantial effort to seat as many of our people in the Coliseum as want tickets.”
Morris added, “As difficult a position as it is to be in, it certainly beats the alternative — not playing.
I hope that our method of distributing tickets, as awkward as it has been, has not turned people off, because
it’s a celebration we want everyone to join in. The size of our school makes us feel like family, and
it’s always tough when you’re faced with the prospect of leaving family members out of a reunion.” Carnegie said, “After
the Wildcats win Friday night, we have a good chance of getting quite a few tickets for Sunday's game.” If
Davidson beats Kentucky tonight, the Davidson ticket office will sell tickets for Sunday's game on a first-come, first-serve basis beginning
at noon on Saturday. “We are really pleased with the tremendous turnout of faculty, students, and staff that have signed
up for the lottery, and I am sure the coaches and the team appreciate the support,” Carnegie said.
