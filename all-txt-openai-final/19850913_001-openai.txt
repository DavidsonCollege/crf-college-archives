To those who have suffered through the last few years of disastrous Davidson football, last Saturday’s 13-0 loss to powerful Western Carolina felt like a victory. Yet to first-year head coach Vic Gatto, last Saturday was a lost opportunity.

“I don’t have the emotional attachment to Davidson’s recent football history that the fans possess,” Gatto said. “Going into the game, the coaches felt we would be able to move the ball on Western. If we could have scored one of the three times we got within fifteen yards of their end zone, we may have been able to alter Western’s game plan enough to win the game.”

Let it be known Davidson football has changed. Against Western Carolina, the Wildcats threw 55 passes. Junior quarterback Steve Bradley had 26 completions for 245 yards. The incessant reverses and draw plays of yesteryear are no more. The fan of the forward pass will love the change.

Unfortunately, Bradley’s barrage of passes failed to produce any points. Davidson's three scoring opportunities ended in interceptions and a missed field goal.

“Good execution is critical to us if we are going to compete with our opponents’ superior size and speed,” Gatto said. “I was disappointed that our execution inside Western’s 15-yard line wasn’t as crisp as it was leading up to the 15.”

Gatto and the coaching staff recognized the efforts of several other players. Receiving offensive player of the week was senior wingback Jay Poag, who led the team with twelve receptions. Senior defensive back Tony Smith was named defensive player of the game for his constant hustle over the field. Finally, senior Doug Neil was named special teams player of the game.

Though Davidson ran sparingly, Western Carolina ran constantly. The Catamounts had 67 rushes for 267 yards. The relentless rushing attack, with plenty of timely passes, was too strong for Davidson’s depthless defense to stop completely. Yet Davidson did cause three turnovers and force Western to settle for field goals twice.

Western Carolina kicker Scott Roach began the scoring with a mammoth 53-yard field goal in the first quarter to give the Catamounts a 3-0 lead. Western had to settle for a field goal because of the determination of Davidson’s defense.

The Catamounts finally reached the Davidson end zone. Western scored a touchdown in the second quarter on, of all things, a 6-yard, fourth-down reverse. The touchdown was the culmination of a relentless rushing attack that gradually wore down the defense.

Roach ended the game’s scoring with a 32-yard field goal in the third quarter. Once again, the tireless Davidson defense forced Western Carolina to settle for less than a touchdown.

The Wildcats’ fine showing against Western Carolina is even more impressive because Davidson had several key players injured. Senior Horace Manor, injured in a summer auto accident, has not yet received medical approval to play. Considering the seriousness of Manor’s accident, it is a miracle that he even intends to play this season. With Manor back in the lineup, Davidson would have a potent running attack.Short on attack to complement their new passing attack. Defensive captain, junior Gary Stewart, also missed the game against Western. Stewart will miss several weeks due to mononucleosis. Davidson showed a lot of determination against Western, a commodity they will need more of before the season ends.

Strange as it sounds, the 90-degree heat hurt Western Carolina more than Davidson. The Catamounts made a request at halftime to shorten the last two quarters by three minutes each. Coach Gatto denied the request and the Catamounts faded in the last quarter despite their massive use of substitutes, a luxury Western Davidson didn’t have. “I was really pleased with the team’s effort,” Gatto said, “but we need to keep improving.” Davidson gets a chance to improve and even its record against Gardner-Webb tomorrow at Richardson Field.

Soccer Team Suffers Three Shutouts On The Road

Davidson’s soccer team did not have a pleasant first week. Three difficult road games resulted in three quick losses, no Davidson goals, and a dismal 0-3 record. “We knew the first three games would be tough,” said coach Charlie Slagle. “I was hoping to be 1-2 at this point, but it didn’t happen.”

Richmond began the misery over a week ago by trouncing Davidson 4-0. The score was only 1-0 at halftime, but several quick second-half goals and the 97-degree weather put the game out of Davidson’s reach. Slagle took the blame for the loss. “I had our team playing the wrong defense,” Slagle said. “The midfielders had too much responsibility and had no chance to fulfill their assignments. We've corrected this problem and I think the last two games showed considerable improvement on defense.”

William and Mary handed Davidson its second loss of the year by beating the Cats 3-0. Again, the halftime score was much closer than the final score (0-0) and a pair of quick goals to start the second half killed Davidson's hopes of a win. “There was a period of about four minutes when the defense just broke down,” senior Wallis Goodman said. “They had some great shots, but we could have stopped some of their goals.”

On Wednesday, Davidson played at Wake Forest and lost a heartbreaker 1-0. Wake’s goal came only a few minutes before the end of regulation play. The important development of this game was Davidson's improved defensive play. The young defense handled a powerful ACC opponent quite well. “Our team played superbly up and down the field,” Slagle said. “No question that this was our best game to date. Neither team took advantage of the opportunities presented to them. We missed an opportunity to win the game and that disappointed me. Still, I was pleased by our improved effort.”

Davidson debuts at home tomorrow after the football game. The first ever United Carolina Bank/Davidson Soccer Tournament will give the Wildcats a chance to improve their record. None of the other participants, Belmont Abbey, Georgia Southern or Wofford, match any of Davidson's first three opponents’ talent. Yet you don’t have to be a genius to realize that Davidson can't win if they can’t score.
