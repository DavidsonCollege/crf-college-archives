AN OPPORTUNITY.

It has been well said that a college is a place of opportunity for all who enter it. There are to be found there advantages for training that cannot be duplicated in any other place. This is true because the business of a college is to train men and women for filling with ability whatever places they are to take in life, and to this business the college devotes its whole time.

In an age when the demand is for the well-rounded man and for one with ideas, it is necessary that the broadest training possible be obtained if the responsible positions of life are to be filled creditably and successfully. It has become therefore the policy of the up-to-date colleges to introduce into their courses whatever will tend to broaden the views of the students or give them new ideas. In pursuance of this policy a number of colleges have adopted the plan of having lecturers from other institutions, from professional and business life, and men noted in literature to deliver to the students lectures on various subjects of interest and profit.

In another column of this issue will be found the announcement of the first of such a series of lectures that has been planned by the college for the Spring term. These lectures will be on subjects of science, education, literature, and business, and will well repay all of the students who attend them. This is the first time that such a series has been tried at Davidson, and if the students show the proper interest they will be continued. Otherwise, they will be dropped. All of the students and townspeople are urged and invited to attend them.

Shive, Financial Agent of the College, expects to make a trip north soon, including Washington, Philadelphia, and New York. He is at present working in the vicinity of Davidson. Of this Endowment Fund, $25,000 is to be used for a gymnasium building, which Davidson has needed for a number of years.
