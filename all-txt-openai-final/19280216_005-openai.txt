THE DAVIDSONIAN, FEBRUARY 16, 1928

Old Red Tank Sold to Monroe Concern

No longer will all-wise sophomores paint freshman numerals on the water tank; no longer will occupants of the barracks be
able to test their throwing ability by hurling missiles over this old landmark; energetic photographers will be forced to seek
a different vantage point from which to snap pictures of the campus; and still again, the moonlight loving poet will
have to seek other places to recline while delighting in beautiful verse as misty clouds float across the moon, for
the red water tank has been sold.

College officials recently completed negotiations with the Manette Mills, of Monroe, N.C., whereby this huge red tank was disposed of
and the purchasers plan to begin removal of the structure within the next few days. The reason for the sale
was that of the useless place which the tank was held during the past few years since water is obtained
from the city. The tank was erected in 1917 by the K. D. Cold Manufacturing Co., of Newnan, Ga. Its
weight is sixty tons and the capacity is eighty thousand gallons.

lege, Clemson College, and the Glee Club of Greenville High School, all of South Carolina. The whole program was rendered
at Textile Hall and was well attended, the hall being crowded to capacity. The student bodies of Converse College and
Greenville Woman's College were present at all concerts.

Coincident with the contest for the championship a business meeting was held of the Southern Glee Club Association, which is
affiliated with the Intercollegiate Glee Club Association. This business meeting was attended by representatives of the glee clubs that are
members of the Southern Glee Club Association. Professor Cullum, head of the Music Department, and John S. Foster, president of
the Glee Club, attended the meeting as representatives of the Davidson Glee Club.

Davidson Theatre Lists Attractions

The local theater management announces several highly-favored pictures for the coming week. In these are found such notable stars as
Richard Dix, Lon Chaney, Bebe Daniels, and Pola Negri. Monday and Tuesday the picture entitled “The Big City,” will be
shown, starring Lon Chaney. Wednesday “Sporting Goods” will be presented with Richard Dix taking the leading role. The manager of
the theater reports that each of these pictures is unusually good. Thursday Bebe Daniels, playing the leading role in “Feel
My Pulse,” will be shown. Friday Pola Negri will appear in “The Secret Hour,” and Saturday Bob Custer in a
thrilling Westerner.

The following pictures are announced for some time in the near future: “Love,” which is a picture in which the
two famous stars John Gilbert and Greta Garbo appear, Jack Mulhall and Dorothy Mackaill in “Ladies’ Night in a Turkish
Bath,” and Billie Dove in “The Heart of a Follies Girl.”

Seven Juniors Try Skill as Orators

Juniors in charge of the oratoricals which will be held during the weekend designated as Junior Speaking announce that good
response is being made to the call for entrants in this contest. The time of the selection of the best
Junior orator has been set for Friday evening, April 27.

The committee in charge of this feature, composed of W. K. Pritchett, chairman, W. L. Dumas, H. A. Knox, and
R. C. Grady, is considering means of holding the try-outs and promise a statement as to further progress soon. Present
plans call for a preliminary contest to be held during the second week in April when five or six men
will be chosen. Among those who have signified their intention of entering the contest are Stewart Long, Dick Flinn, Reid
Graham, Lawrence Dumas, Hub Knox, Doug Wilkinson, and Kendrick Pritchett. These men are preparing their speeches already and others are
expected to report their desire to compete very soon.

AGNES Scott Lures Gleemen Southward

It was voted, at the business session, to retain the feature of student directors. The Davidson Glee Club, widely heralded
as one of the best...Club in the state posed to the student directors, because this year, is concluding plans for
spring excursions which will allow it to perform before Davidson fans in all parts of this section. The arrangements call
for short trips to Charlotte and Albemarle, among other places, at both of which places the club has appeared before.
The climax of the season will be the trip to Atlanta the first week in March.

They thought the quality of work done was not as high as it should be. However, in conciliation, it was
resolved to set an ideal of performance. The invitation of Greenville to again meet there next year was accepted provisionally,
it being thought by many that a more central place could be found. Major P. W. Price, of N.C. State,
was elected president of the Southern Association. He is also president of the North Carolina State Glee Club Association. The
shorter trips arranged by the business staff call for only one performance. The club's achievement in winning second place in
the state contest, missing first by a hair’s breadth, will ensure a good reception in cities in this state. Charlotte
fans have heard too many delightful entertainments from Davidson clubs to allow a performance to come and go without a
full house. Although the drawing power in other cities will not be as great as in Charlotte, the smaller towns
are expected to come out in large numbers when the Davidson warblers arrive in town.

The trip to Atlanta is an annual event with Davidson Glee Clubs. Supported by a strong chapter of the Alumni
Association and a larger number of Davidson fans and future Davidson students, any of these reasons assures a strong backing.
As has been the custom in the past, the club will make two performances while in Atlanta. On March 2nd,
the first performance will be given at the Atlanta Woman’s Club Auditorium in Atlanta proper. This auditorium will accommodate approximately
six hundred people, and if this year is anything like past years, the house will be packed. On the following
night, the club will appear at Agnes Scott College, in a performance that is probably the real reason for making
the trip. Here another SRO sign is expected to appear, because of the two, this one has proved the more
popular. The combination of an audience of dazzling beauty and a stage attraction such as the club is, fills every
seat.

Since the state contest, Professor Cullum has been working hard with the club in working out the rough spots and
expects that everything will be in the best possible shape for the trips. Some new songs have been introduced, and
with the trips just ahead, the club has been working with a keen interest in the work.
