Indian College Presidents Visit Davidson

Miss C.N. Mangala and Mrs. Santosh Puri are principals of colleges in India. They were in Davidson on Tuesday as part of a Fulbright Project, which brings educational administrators from India to the U.S.

In their tour of colleges here in the southeast, Mangala and Puri have found the community college concept very relevant to education problems in India. They explain that in India, colleges are not open to senior citizens and retired persons. They lament this loss of human resources and believe that community colleges, which meet the needs of a broad spectrum of people, are important for India’s development.

As principals of liberal arts colleges like Davidson, Mangala and Puri do not advocate technical education over the liberal arts; however, they do believe in “need-based education.” They foresee more “open” universities in India which will admit people of all ages, and they hope that more technical courses in Indian colleges will help students to better find their place in life.

On Davidson’s campus, Miss Mangala and Mrs. Puri were much impressed with the new computer system and the Careers Office.
