**Ain't Misbehavin’ features the music of Fats Waller**

By MARK CHEN

Ex post facto reviews are tragic productions. What is the point in them, after all? If the review is of
a bad show, the reader can congratulate himself on a narrow escape. If the show was good, then the review
can say nothing except “You should have been there.” That is what this review has to say, for you should
have been there when the road show of Ain't Misbehavin’ came to Davidson Monday evening. You missed a great show
with a talented cast, a good band, a lot of Broadway excitement, and just enough wickedness for a little spice.

Ain't Misbehavin’ is a musical revue featuring the music of Thomas “Fats” Waller. Fats Waller was born in Greenwich Village
in 1904 and raised in Harlem by deeply religious parents. His father told the young lad that jazz was the
devil's music (he and Tipper Gore would be on the right wavelength). At first, the boy heeded his father’s advice,
studying classical piano and playing the church organ. But Fats then had a vision and set out for his true
calling. Soon he was writing the music which became known as “swing” and would make him famous. In the Seventies,
his music was put into a Broadway show that won the Tony Award for Best Musical and the New York
Drama Critic’s Circle Award. The show finally came to Love Auditorium on Monday.

The musical is set in a Harlem nightclub of the 1930s and 40s. For two hours the audience listened to
thirty songs either written or recorded by Fats Waller. Five performers moved in a choreographed routine of song, dance, and
play with the audience. They should be mentioned together: Kevin Anderson, the big guy, Monroe Kent III, the skinny guy,
Alvaleta Guess, a big woman with long hair, Jannis Warner, a big woman with short hair, Yvette Curtis, the short
one. I can’t give any better descriptions than that because they had no “roles.” They all acted together as a
team. And as a team, they showed Broadway in its strength.

Probably everybody has seen the music productions at theme parks, where all the bright and perky singers come out to
do the same, tired Broadway songs for the 3,227th time that summer. Listening to Rogers & Hammerstein done by a
bored ensemble is like going to McDonald’s — it’s filling but tasteless. Plus you know exactly what to expect. The
troupe that came to Davidson was a real music show, one that could still give the energy and talent even
when they had done it many times before. For folks who don’t get to Broadway very often and who don’t
have the forty-five to a hundred dollars for a ticket, the show was a look at what Broadway can be.

But a musical is nothing, even with the best cast, if the music isn’t good. For most people, Fats Waller
is a no-name. They ought to learn better by going to this show. The music of Fats Waller is jazz
before it became Cultured and Dignified. The music is as bold and unstoppable as the man. Waller's main concern in
life was to enjoy himself. His second concern was to entertain. Fortunately, the two went together, for the music is
so fast, inventive, and joyous that the audience can’t help but be caught up in the mood. But Waller was
gifted enough to convey all emotions, so that these songs also vary. Sometimes happy and funny, other times angry and
passionate or mournful, the music never stays still long enough for anyone to be bored.

The lyrics were themselves a strength of the show. Though not written by Waller, they fit the music perfectly. Waller
was also a comedian, so the lyrics were often funny and just a shade wicked. For example, the audience loved
“The Reefer Song,” a number in which all the cast members smoked strange-looking cigarettes in the dark. In a number
of songs, there was a strong whiff of forbidden pleasures coming after dark. As a man and a woman danced
in a nightclub, the man sang, “Think of all the thrills you get for a dollar!” His partner was not
amused. The audience was. But there was also the double meaning within songs like “Black and Blue,” sung by the
cast with no movement at all. The mournful words...seemed to have another meaning, one not unintended. When the show ended,
the audience gave the performers a standing ovation. It was simply a terrific evening. But you weren't there. You were
probably wasting your time—going to a party, watching the NCAA basketball championship, or doing the reading. Such waste is the
result of laziness. Laziness is one of the cardinal sins. So heed this review as a moral warning. Swear off
your wicked ways, rid yourself of sloth, and remember to go to the next show that comes to Love Auditorium.
If other shows in Love Auditorium measure up to Ain't Misbehavin’, you shall enjoy the blessings of moral behavior.

Hot Mustard, NASCAR races and good people

By TREY JAMMES

Mooresville has a wide variety of restaurants that are well known by everyone. However, there are also some that are
tucked away and not as well known. This week two of those have been explored: the Side Door Deli and
the Country Plate.

Side Door Deli

For a true New York Deli style sandwich, the Side Door Deli is the only place to go. They have
almost every type of sandwich or hoagie imaginable and they are all good. From the meat to the mustard, the
Side Door creates sandwiches unparalleled in the Davidson area. The ham is not the typical pressed junk nor is it
too salty. The pastrami has a relatively small amount of fat in it and is remarkably tender. The other cold
cuts are of similarly high quality. But meat alone does not a good sandwich make. Ham and cheese is livened
up by rye bread and, of course, pumpernickel is necessary for pastrami. The Side Door Deli provides a choice of
bread on all of its sandwiches, something that is hard to find in this area. There is even a choice
of mustard. The homemade brown mustard spices up any sandwich and is the most popular. However, if you want your
eyes to water and nose to run, try the homemade hot mustard. I would recommend this only to mustard lovers
because it tends to overpower the rest of the sandwich. The mustard alone is worth the trip to Mooresville since
it cannot be found at any store or through any special television offer.

Not only does the Side Door Deli have great food, but it also has beer and pool. The back room
has one pool table and several pinball machines to make the meal more exciting. There is also a giant screen
television which normally shows NASCAR racing, a crowd pleaser. The Side Door Deli is located about one and a half
miles north of What-a-Burger. It is on the right on Main Street. It is open from 10:30 a.m. to 10:30
p.m. Tuesday through Saturday. A sandwich costs about $2.60, and a hoagie is $3.10.

Country Plate

Unfortunately, the Country Plate is not quite as good as the Side Door Deli. However, the good atmosphere almost makes
up for the lack of quality food. People watching is definitely better than the food at the Country Plate. The
cheeseburger is the safest bet on the menu. I have not tried the chuckwagon or the liver mush, but I
do not think it is worth the risk. The special, meat and vegetable, is popular with the locals, but white
beans do not appeal to me. Why go? To meet the people. Tammy the waitress and Rick the biker are
interesting people to talk to as you sit on torn naugahyde seats and eat slightly overcooked food. The Plate bills
itself as a “Family Restaurant” and it lives up to that claim. It is an informal (the dress code is
stricter at McDonald's) meeting place where people can enjoy themselves. The Country Plate is about two miles north of What-a-Burger
on the right. The hours are 6 a.m. to 8 p.m., Monday through Friday, and 6 a.m. to 2 p.m.
on Saturday. A cheeseburger costs $1.30.

Why go? To meet people.

I would recommend trying both of these restaurants, or at least the Side Door Deli. The food there is like
none other in the area. While the Country Plate is not as good, the experience is a new one for
most Davidson students.
