The Davidson College rugby team, those desperate souls who claim they will “wander like Israelites” until they find a practice
field, finished on the short end of an 18-4 score against the Columbia Rugby Football Club.

Davidson was the first team to score, as Jeff Morrow plunged across the goal line for a try.

Columbia then took the initiative and scored two tries and a field goal, making the half-time score 11-4.

The Wildcats played an inspired second half, but a tenacious Columbia defense was able to hold them off while their
own offense managed a try and a field goal, resulting in a final score of 18-4.

The Davidson team, in their toughest game of the season, played a good match despite the lopsided score. Outstanding individuals
included Morrow, David Swain, Mike Robinson, and Bucky Bank, the Davidson captain.

The Davidson scrum was outmanned, but good play by the backs kept the ruggers in the game.

In general, the Columbia team was more experienced and had a distinct size advantage. Their scrum, consisting of several ex-college
football players and led by an experienced hooker, constantly kept the Wildcats on the defensive.

The Columbia pre-game yell, closely resembling a tribal chant, generated the comment among the spectators, “a bunch of animals.” It
was obvious from the start that the Davidson squad had its hands full.

In a second match, Davidson’s back-up squad lost 24-0 to Columbia.

The rugby team, coached by Dr. Devon, will play its next home game against Wake Forest on October 17.
