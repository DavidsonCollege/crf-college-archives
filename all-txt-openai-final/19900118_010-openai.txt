**Lucia lets loose**

If anyone can come up with a compelling argument for Davidson supporting an election in which students compete against each
other on the basis of what they look like instead of what they have accomplished, I am more than willing
to listen to it. The only argument that I have ever heard in favor of keeping the election of homecoming
queens is tradition. In contrast to many people’s stereotypes of feminists, I am not against everything that has to do
with societal traditions. Graduation, for example, is a tradition that I greatly look forward to. Any election which excludes competitors
on the basis of their gender seems suspicious, however.

For those who believe that the annual homecoming elections are truly worthy events that Davidson ought to continue holding, I
propose that we include men also—electing a homecoming king as well as a homecoming queen. If it is actually a
great honor, then there must be men out there who have been secretly longing for the opportunity to smash down
the gender barriers and have a shot at wearing that crown and holding those roses. If we granted them this
opportunity then nobody could accuse us of discrimination.

On the other hand, there are those who believe that homecoming elections are a dumb idea in the first place,
and instead of having men participate in them too, we should probably just scrap the whole thing. The reason they
are a dumb idea is that people are supposed to be rewarded for their achievements, not for whether they happen
to have long eyelashes and rosy cheeks. Although the precise criteria by which the homecoming court is chosen have not
been articulated, beauty is normally considered a main factor.

Now, I don’t have anything against beauty. Nor do I think that the women who participated in the homecoming elections
are just a bunch of bubble-headed campus bunnies who don’t care about anything beyond their cellulite on their thighs and
whether their mascara will smudge. On the contrary, I have found every one of them to be articulate, friendly, talented,
and especially intellectually sharp. That is precisely why I think homecoming elections are not valuable: these students should be applauded
more for being really cool people than for being pretty people; they should get more recognition for earning a 3.8
G.P.A. than having a body with 38-26-38 measurements.

If even a place which values learning as much as Davidson does will not challenge our society’s ideas of what
is valued in a woman, then we are only encouraging our women students to become Vanna Whites instead of rocket
scientists. Other elections held on the campus are held to find the most capable person to do a job. A
homecoming queen, by contrast, is not elected to do anything. She stands in front of a crowd, gets applauded, and
has her picture taken. Despite the fact that Brooke Shields has managed to make a career out of doing that,
it is not a job.

The issue of valuing appearance does not involve women’s appearance only. Sure, based on appearance only,I would much rather spend
a romantic evening here at Davidson College in the embrace of Kevin Costner than in the embrace of Pee-Wee Herman.
Nevertheless, throughout history, it is women who have been treated as objects whose purpose in life was to please men.
One of the most obvious ways for them to do this was to look appealing to men. There are many
examples of this tendency: one Davidson senior had a grandmother who told her, “Once you get those braces off your
teeth you'll be pretty enough to marry a doctor.” The implications of trying to achieve success by being pretty enough
to be wanted by a successful man are clear. While getting rid of homecoming queen elections certainly will not get
rid of the tendency to consider women’s value according to the color of their hair or the shape of their
bodies, or the tendency to treat them as objects rather than people, it will indicate that the institution of Davidson
College does not support or condone this degradation. The practice of electing a homecoming queen as it now stands has
no defenses against being accused of sexism. Therefore, we need to decide whether we want to (A) keep homecoming elections
as they are and ignore the accusations of sexism, (B) continue holding these contests and elect both a queen and
a king, or (C) just ditch the whole election and get on with the football game.
