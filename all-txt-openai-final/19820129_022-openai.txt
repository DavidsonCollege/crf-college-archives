**Road Trip Abstinence**

Eight years is a long time to go without sex, much less a road trip with three consecutive Southern Conference
wins. So imagine how it felt to the Davidson basketball team — something akin to orgasm.

Last Wednesday night Jamie Hall called his lovely wife Michelle from Johnson City, Tennessee. “We’re gonna win tonight,” he said.
Not too many people would have taken him seriously at the time, especially considering the Bucs had routed Davidson 69-59
in Johnston Gym.

Well, Jamie has probably never been called Isaiah before, but this time his prophecy proved right. The Cats upset East
Tennessee 71-69.

Apparently, it was all in the head.

“We were really in the game mentally,” said Assistant Coach Jim Baker.

With 6:40 left in the game and the score tied at 61, Hall ignited a go-ahead spark for the Wildcats,
which quickly melted away. Hall hit both ends of a one-and-one, Kenny Wilson scored four on a layup and a
one-and-one, John Carroll added some more, and soon thereafter Davidson held a comfortable 69-61 lead with just over a minute
to play.

The Bucs, however, had had the outside magic all night, and Lady Luck was not about to make a premature
exit.

With :50 left Aaron Douglas hit a three-point field goal, and ten seconds later he gave an encore that cut
the Cat lead to 69-67. JC missed a couple of one-and-ones, and with :20 left they opened the lane for
a game-tying layup. Carroll, however, wasn’t about to let his teammates down, as he canned a 10-foot jumper from the
right side with :03 left. Final verdict: DC 71, ETSU 69.

But the win meant a whole lot more than a higher digit in the win column.

The Cats won against heavy odds and against the same team that had embarrassed them at home, and all the
while with the same game plan. They won on the road, which is tough to do in the Southern Conference.
But most importantly, as Kenny Wilson put it, “A lot of things came together for us.”

**Marshall**

Marshall would be the test to see just how much came together and whether or not the win over East
Tennessee was a turning point after all. Forty minutes of basketball indicated the affirmative as the Cats came on top
61-59.

The game came down to the free throws, where the Cats won several games last season. “It could have been
a 15 to 20 point game if we’d hit our free throws,” said Kenny Wilson.

Just before the midway point of the half, the Herd was thundering before a crowd of 8,852 in the newly-opened
Henderson Center. The coaches were having obscure thoughts about a loss, but the team wasn’t. Brian Rowan and Cliff Tribus
combined for a string of six unanswered points, and by halftime a 26-17 deficit had been leveled off to 33
apiece.

Al McGuire figures the first four minutes of the second half are crucial to a team’s confidence and morale, and
the Wildcats wouldn’t jump to disagree. They outscored the hosts 13-6 in the first seven minutes as they built up
momentum.

Down the stretch, though, a usual nemesis nearly cost them the game. Rick Wilson missed the front end of four
one-and-ones but made up for it with some key steals. With :07 left Jamie Hall set up at the line
for two shots, and with a 61-59 lead, but missed both. It came down to one last Marshall shot, but
it didn’t fall.

**VMI**

It’s hard to get psyched up for a team that’s 0-14 overall, 0-5 in the conference, and playing in a
not-so-cavernous 5,000-seat arena which is cavernous with only 1,800 occupants.

As a whole, the team wasn’t pumped up, and thus VMI cut the lead to 3 at one point. On
the other hand, Kenny Wilson was so pumped up he didn’t play well, scoring only 12 points.

KW’s lackluster performance wasn’t of great detriment, however, due to superb help coming off the bench. The team voted the
game ball to the whole team because of the unified effort. For example, senior walk-on Gary “Stork” McDonald, starting only
his second game, scored 10 points, grabbed 3 rebounds, and logged in 26 minutes of playing time.

Coach Baker was happy with the 72-58 outcome, “It wasn’t a pretty game to watch, but we accomplished a lot
of our team goals.”

Tomorrow night the red-hot Wildcats host the even hotter UT-C Moccasins. The Mocs were 8-0 in the Conference as of
mid-week, so it’s a showdown of No. 1 vs. No. 2. Monday night the Keydets of VMI will be in
Johnston Gym.
