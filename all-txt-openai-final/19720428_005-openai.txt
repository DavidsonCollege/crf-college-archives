### MURDER IN THE CLASSROOM

**Antonio ‘Tony the Tiger’ Abbottelli is victim of crime wave.**

#### Open Warfare Rocks Davidson Community

By SAMUEL NASTY

The Davidson community has been shocked this past week by a series of killings that have taken place in plain view of the campus population, beginning Monday, April 24, with the murder of Antonio “Tony the Tiger” Abbottelli. Shot down before the eyes of his students, Davidson faculty member Abbottelli, long known to be a “capo” in the family of Roberto “Kayrat” Campanello, was dead on arrival at the Mooresville Veterinary Hospital.

Though Abbottelli was known to be running numbers among his students, authorities speculate that his murder is linked in a “hit be hit” circle of vengeance with the discovery last weekend of the body of Gino “No-Mind” Scallopini in the Johnston Gym pool, where it had been for approximately two weeks.

Eyewitnesses to the murder shared a feeling of disbelief over the disruption of the class by three submachine-gun toting hoods and a gunman disguised as a student, who calmly shot Abbottelli twice through the chest. “It was terrible,” said Terry Hirst, a class member. “It was the second worst thing I’ve seen in a week.”

Abbottelli’s murder was followed hard upon by the slaying of Stephano “The Lip” Baragona in the Davidson cafeteria on Monday afternoon. The assassin, identified as Georgie “The Shnoz” Draughonetti, was gunned down in turn by Baragona’s henchmen. This killing is the authorities’ first link of Don Guappo Lasagna with the carnage. Mr. Lasagna was unavailable for comment.

In the course of this week, the Davidson community has witnessed the murders of Bruno “The Pug” Sorrentino, Terry Hirst, and, in the midst of a Senate meeting, the Honorable Senator William “Payola” Rollandino. Except for the Hirst murder, which, authorities say, may somehow be associated with recent activities in the Cunningham Fine Arts Building, all these killings seem part of the larger picture that the police are trying to piece together. More killings, according to Police Chief Sec. Off. Socolubi, seem imminent.

### ASU Evaluates Administrators from Outside Perspective

The Faculty Senate at Appalachian State University has devised a plan for the faculty to evaluate the university’s administrators. This plan is similar to an already existing student evaluation of the faculty. Included in the evaluation of the administration are Appalachian’s president, his assistants, the four university vice presidents, seven deans and their assistants, and 26 department chairmen.

On the evaluation form, a faculty member will, for example, grade his department chairman on a one-to-ten scale on his administrative skills which include abilities such as understanding others’ points of view, handling conflicts, involving colleagues in the process of decision making, and the promotion of academic encouragement of independent expression.

Max Dowell, Faculty Senate chairman, commented: “I hope this will be the beginning of a process by which we can help administrators here upgrade the quality of their work.”

### Wake Forest Faces Book Stealing Crisis

Approximately 5,000 books are missing from the library at Wake Forest University, librarian Merrill Berthrong reported after a complete inventory during spring break. Since the last inventory of the campus library was undertaken five years ago, book stealing has increased 100 percent. Berthrong added that the library is replacing 1,000 old books each year and is spending approximately $10,000 in the process. Berthrong said that the library might be forced to adopt more restrictive means to prevent theft. He mentioned an electronically controlled turnstile located at each library exit as a possible measure. These turnstiles are able to detect books that have not been checked out and will block the exit.anyone possessing these books from leaving the library.

Liza Minelli’s Performance Excels In ‘Cabaret’

A REVIEW By BOB WRIGHT
Staff Writer

An awful lot of hubbub has ensued over Liza Minelli’s virtuoso performance in the film of “Cabaret” by Robert Fosse (pronounced Fossey). And all this attention is certainly deserved; Liza Minelli is simply superb. In fact, she is almost too good for the role of Sally Bowles, a second-rate singer in a third-rate Berlin cabaret of the 1930s. Her musical numbers, all of which take place in the Kit Kat Klub, are all dynamite. Her voice sparkles and shines and sometimes just spills out all over us.

But in all this aforementioned hubbub over Miss Minelli, the film itself has either been completely ignored or dismissed as not being good enough to keep up with its female lead. True, the film has its problems, but its good points are also considerable. Robert Fosse has tried fairly hard to make the film more than just a musical, and so it is.

Joel Grey as the cabaret MC is a vision of chalky-faced decadence and leering vulgarity. He is seen only in the cabaret musical scenes, but he somehow pervades the whole of the film. His reptilian eyes seem to be watching from around every corner.

The plot is taken from Christopher Isherwood’s 1934 novel, Berlin Stories. The hero, of sorts, is Brian Roberts, an English teaching student from England who comes to Berlin to study, meets Sally Bowles, is plunged into her life of “divine decadence,” knocks her up, falls in love with her, discovers that she has had an abortion, and splits, roughly in that order.

When Sally and Brian are arguing over a mutual friend, Max, “Screw Max!” comes up in the conversation. “I do,” says Sally. “So do I,” Brian replies. Subtle, huh? Still, the film never gets cute. Fosse has captured the edge of madness. It is Nazism which, like an obnoxious odor in the theatre, hangs heavily in the air of the film.

Director Fosse’s opening and closing image is of the cabaret audience (and vicariously ourselves) grossly reflected in a distorted mirror. And the film deals chiefly in reflections, false surfaces, gay facades. Berlin in the 30s, rising Nazism, the “last-desperate fling” atmosphere is evoked with little sympathy and less pity. It is a tough film, and, I feel, a good one.
