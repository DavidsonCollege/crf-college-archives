**New Building Should Be Named In Honor Of Pres. Cunningham**

The year 1956-57 will be looked back on as a transition in the history of Davidson College. It is the
end of an era, and the beginning of another. The contributions and services of Dr. John Rood Cunningham over the
past sixteen years have firmly established Davidson as one of the leading educational institutions in the South. In a real
way, his administration has led the college to new and permanent heights that a lesser man might well have failed
to achieve.

Dr. Cunningham's work has manifested for the college what a decade ago might have been termed a vision. He came
to Davidson with a plan—a desire “to do and to make” tangible achievements. He leaves with that vision accomplished. Any
statement concerning the work that Dr. Cunningham has done for the college would be an under-evaluation. The results of his
devotion to Davidson can be seen plainly in the college plant. He has preserved the good of the old and
planted anew that which was better.

In honor of a great President of Davidson College, and as a reminder of the loyalty and devotion of her
favorite son, the least that could be done would be for one of the proposed new buildings (or the new
dormitory) to bear the name, John Rood Cunningham.

**Labor Reforms Long Over-Due**

Tailor-made suits, interest-free loans, racing stables, plush Palm Springs homes, and lost union records are the symbols of a situation
that has shocked the American people in the past few months. We have seen Messers Beck, Brewster, and Hoffa (the
real stars of the show) parade before the witness stand. While they did not say all that they might have,
their testimony brought to the public view the fact that in the councils of Big Labor, too few men hold
too much power.

At present, the AFL-CIO has a monopoly over the nation’s labor unions. This giant labor organization can cripple the American
economy on a few hours' notice. And the amazing fact is that the czars of Big Labor are protected by
present federal laws. Yes, it is legally okay for Big Labor to do exactly what the anti-trust laws say that
Big Business cannot do. Moreover, the entangling hand of the federal government has brought organized labor under its protective wing.

Fortunately, the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 corrected many of the injustices of the Wagner Act of 1935 which gave rise
to Big Labor. Nevertheless, a large and powerful union organization still enjoys special and paternalistic government protection. For so long
the pendulum has swung in favor of Big Labor. It appears that the reforming conscience of the American people will
demand that it now swing the other way.

In 1890, the Sherman Anti-Trust Law helped to put Big Business in its proper perspective. Before much longer, there must
be reform in the field of Big Labor. First, labor unions should be put under the anti-trust laws. To our
way of thinking, it is just as wrong for the unions to get together to paralyze America as it is
for the manufacturers to combine to fix prices. Next, the union high command should be decentralized by returning to the
locals much of the control and power to call strikes. The power and right to strike should rest “closer to
home.” Finally, all of the states should adopt “right to work” laws. The right not to join a union (or
any other organization for that matter) is the prerogative of every man. The power to force a man to join
a union (else lose his job) is tyranny.

The Labor Movement in America has made great and noble strides in the past few decades. Some of its achievements
have been slow in coming and long needed. Nevertheless, the near absolute power that Big Labor commands today is both
dangerous and unnecessary. It is up to the people through their State and federal officials to bring Big Labor into
line with present-day concepts of democratic ideals about economic and political liberty. It cannot be expected to reform itself any
more than Big Business was able to reform itself.

**Please, Mr. Martin**

The summer vacation is the usual time for making improvements in the college facilities. Among the most needed are more
parking spaces. We can have these by making better use of existing areas. Specifically, we suggest the following improvements: (1)
the painting of white lines to indicate specific spaces for each car on the north side of the road behind
East, West, and Duke Dormitories. There is enough room along the north side of this road for approximately twenty-two cars
if properly spaced, but due to haphazard parking often only seventeen or eighteen cars are able to find enough room.
(2) the leveling and paving of the parking area between East and Duke Dorm on the south side of the
road. At present, there is a cement water drain that takes up unnecessary space. This drain could be made level
with the ground. Immediately behind Duke, more cars could park if the existing area was better laid out, and white
lines painted. And by the way, if there are any half-spaces left over, “M-G" owners could have a special place
to fit their vehicles.

**Profanity**

In reference to some of the extreme language used in the vocal inter-communication system between the dormitories, we submit the
following:

“As he knew not what to say, he swore”—Byron.

“A terrible oath, with a swaggering accent sharply twanged off, gives manhood more approbation than ever proof itself would have
earned him.”—Shakespeare

**PRESIDENT’S SPEECH**

**High Standards, Worthy Goals**

(Ed. Note: The following is an excerpt from a speech delivered by Dr. John R. Cunningham in chapel on May
2, 1957)

All persons with purpose and ambition desire the requisites of leadership. We must conceive it not as a right but
as a responsibility. It is my purpose to name at least four of the requisites of true leadership.

In the first place, I would list Capacity. It is not enough that one possesses a strong body, a keen
mind and an ability to assert his purpose to lead. There must be cultivated intelligence. Personality, which is a composite
of many qualities, is also a necessity and one which must be and can be greatly cultivated. Furthermore, there is
the requisite in the area of Capacity of the ability to communicate with others.

**SOUND CHARACTER**

In the second place, I would mention the essential of sound Character. The stars in their courses fight against low
morals and shoddy practices. Let no person assume that he can long be an effective leader without a Character in
which human beings can feel confident.

In the third place, there is the essential of true Courage. Courage is more than a physical quality. It is
this essential which breeds faith and optimism, which believes that the right can be done and should be done and
dares to risk oneself in its accomplishment. It was this quality of courage which led Woodrow Wilson to remark “I
would rather lose in a cause which will ultimately win than to win in a cause that will ultimately lose.”

And the fourth essential to true leadership is Commitment. Human beings are impressed by and stand ready to follow the
man who is willing to commit his all to his purpose. It was this quality to which our Saviour referred
when he said “Whosoever saveth his life shall lose it, but whosoever loseth his life for My sake, will save
it.”

**Successful**

By HARRY HALL.

The Red and Black Masquers’ 1956-57 season began November 16 with a two-night run of N. Richard Nash’s romantic comedy
“The Rainmaker.” An audience of some 200 each evening received it with great enthusiasm. Using a three-set playing area and
unique lighting, “The Rainmaker”...

**COFFEE BREAK**

**Escape? From What?**

By JOHN BERNHARDT

It seems to be an accepted part of our modern psychology to develop little quirks and habits that help us
get free from the unpleasant things that seem to surround us. Everybody nowadays has escape mechanisms—smoking a cigarette, scratching an
ear, playing with a pencil while studying, rocking back and forth in the chair while reading a textbook.

**BROADER ESCAPES**

Here at Davidson we have still broader escapes—whole evenings watching a flick or TV, a night of bridge, or a
weekend off at another school. We don't like to face the unpleasant reality of work at Davidson.

**DAVIDSON REALITY**

This suggests that either we think the reality of Davidson is wrong, or we just don’t want to face any
true reality. The problems of facing life, and of working hard when necessary, are real problems. Do we here try
to escape too much? Look at how much time and talk...we spend on playing with pencils, rocking back and forth
on our chairs, watching TV, and going off campus on weekends. It isn't necessary to be a Bernhardt bookworm or
a woman-hater, but maybe a better balance is needed. Escape mechanisms seem to be a part of our modern society.
But Davidson, or any college, should prepare us to go out and meet life. If we concentrate too much on
escaping here, are we preparing ourselves as we need to for meeting reality later? Will we be able to run
off every weekend when we are “on our own?”

McAFEE

While many personalities will be missing from the faculty and administration next year, one of the most regrettable absences in
this period of turnover in the school will be Dr. Malcolm McAfee. Into a school which has been accused of
excessive conservatism but never of extreme liberalism, he has brought a little of the liberal thought of the outside world.
Although ideas different from our own are not usually agreeable to us, they are essential to a liberal education, and
Dr. McAfee has contributed much in filling out our ideas with the liberal, the progressive, and the new. Davidson will
certainly miss Dr. McAfee’s leavening influence in its approaching remodeling program.

Leadership in some measure is possible for all who will qualify themselves for it. Gambetta was a young man of
modest background in the country of France in the last century. At the age of 19 he was leaving his
humble home to go to Paris to study law. He recalled throughout his later years that his mother’s ambition and
plea to him as he left was “Come back somebody.”

COME BACK SOMEBODY

With that purpose firmly set, he took his place in the leadership of his nation in one of the most
critical periods of her history and served in the ministry of his government in a remarkable degree. Set for yourself
high standards, pure motives and worthy goals and “Come back somebody.”

Dramas

“Rainmaker” represented a first of its type for the Davidson stage.

PACKED HOUSE

Midwinters Dance Weekend set the scene for the Masquers’ second production. “Gramercy Ghost”, a comedy in two acts, provided a
light, laugh-filled evening for approximately 500 men and dates who attended.

DISAPPOINTMENTS

Thus, for the Red and Black Masquers, it has been a successful season though there were disappointments. Through the pressure
of academic demands, other events and activities, and possibly a lack of interest, few of the Davidson students supported these
plays. Only by student interest and support, both in attendance and participation in the productions can drama be given its
proper place in the campus life.

LETTER: TO EDITOR

Leaders Discussed

Dear Editor:

In their lamb white ideals and practices, the campus leadership organ is overlooking a symposium of talent that sometimes makes
me want to cry out, “Well, good lordy, how can they be so eyeless?” It is such a tremendous chance
to lash out again with the reins of activity which they clutch so tightly in their hot little paws, that
it sometimes makes a man say, “But let us stand up and put the finger on the rotten spot.”

The first, and by far the most obvious, of the passed-by group is the captain of the flick team. For
the job of Sam Myopic is a noble one, taking many arduous hours of service and recruiting. Every night the
sound and the tumult of his ever-growing band rip the goat-cry from their throats as they follow Sam Myopic anywhere
he will take them. This is leadership, yes indeedy.

Sam’s running mate is also a serious contender for campus honors. He is Barry Budweiser, captain of the drinking team,
perhaps a post that requires more stamina and strength of spirit and convictions than any other. His following is legion,
and the influence which he exerts is thundering. It is he who keeps his head when all around are losing
theirs. And he gets the job done, cans down.

These two are only a small portion of the talent that is lying fallow as a result of neglect. I
could mention scores of others. Take the captains of the sunbathing team, the road-running team, the television squad, the scratched
knee team, the unshaven club, the filter cigarette organization, the I-Hate-Chapel-and-Vespers delegation. The list is unending. It is high time
their talents were dug from the ground, to shed their light as the official organ sheds theirs, for the betterment
of step-mother school. Let’s put them in their deserved place on the official organ.

ROTC Evaluation

By BILL MARTIN

Commissioning exercises for some 50 seniors on May 25 will bring to a close the most successful year the ROTC
Cadet Regiment has ever enjoyed at Davidson. For the first time in the (Editor’s Note: The following statement was released
today by Lt. Col. John D. Sapp.)

I wish to express my most sincere appreciation to the students, faculty and administrative officials of Davidson College for the
manner in which they have received and treated me and my family during our three years with the college. I
am particularly appreciative of the splendid cooperation and support given the Military Department by the many student organizations. It has
been all that one could hope for. It has been a distinct privilege to work with the young men of
the caliber found here and I wish you every success for the future.

Unit's history, all training and administrative matters pertaining to training were handled entirely by the Cadet Officers.

SOPHOMORE INTEREST

It is very gratifying to all concerned to find 67% of the Sophomore class in ROTC applying for the Advanced
Course. Numerically this is a sizeable increase over past years and evinces a great deal of interest in the program.
It would be unfair to say that the complete success of the program depended on the Cadet Officers. Without the
forceful and enthusiastic leadership of Col. Sapp and his staff the program would never even have gotten underway.

The highlight of the year was a visit from Hugh M. Milton, Ass’t. Secy. of the Army. Mr. Milton’s comments
were as laudatory as the ROTC could wish for. He said that he could add only superlative on superlative as
to the excellence of the Unit.

In an open letter to the Cadets, Col. Sapp expressed his feelings as he called the year, “... the most
successful year of the Cadet Regiment since the undersigned (Col. Sapp) assumed the duties of PMS&T.”

Honor Fraternities

By JOHN GILMER

The primary function of the Honorary Fraternity Council is the coordination of the meeting times of the honorary fraternities and
various extracurricular organizations.

Another service which next year’s council should consider is a thorough evaluation of the work of each of these groups.
Constructive criticism would aid in strengthening the programs of the honorary fraternities.

The purpose of such an organization is the recognition of excellence in a particular academic field. On this alone the
honorary fraternity can base a sound argument for continued existence.

IMPROVEMENT NEEDED

Many of these groups also provide a valuable service to their members and to the college. However, in others there
seems to be a lack of enthusiasm and much room for improvement.

COMMITTEE SKETCHES

By JOE BELL

The only man on the Committee not a Davidson graduate is J. Spencer Love of Greensboro. He received his A.B.
degree in 1917 from Harvard University, where he also attended the Graduate School of Business Administration. Commissioned a 1st Lieut.
U.S. Army, Infantry, in 1917 he served the following year in France. He rose quickly to the rank of Major.
General Pershing cited him for “exceptionally meritorious and conspicuous service.”

After the war he began a career in textile manufacturing and has since become President of Burlington Industries. He was
Director of the Textile, Clothing, and Leather Goods Bureau, War Production Board, 1943-44.

Besides serving as General Chairman of the Davidson Development Program, 1948-50, and as a Trustee of the College since 1953,
he has been active for several other schools, among them: U.N.C., N.C. State, and Woman's College.

Also from the class of 1922 is James McDowell Richards with the B.A. degree. He not only was a member
of Phi Beta Kappa, but he was also awarded a Rhodes Scholarship. Besides doing graduate work at Oxford he attended
Princeton University and Columbia Theological Seminary. He received the M.A. and B.D. degrees. Until 1932 he held several pastorates in
Georgia. In that year he became President of Columbia Theological Seminary, a position which he still holds. He is also
President of the Board of Trustees, and has served as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church, U.S.
Friends of Mr. Richards have characterized him as a peacemaker and a man of conservative theological convictions.

James P. Hendrix, class of 1925, from Durham, N.C., was president of the student body and on the football team
which won the state championship. He received an M.A. in Chemistry here and went on to the University of Pennsylvania
for his M.D. In 1938 he went to Duke University Medical School to be in charge of Therapeutics. He is
now Associate Professor of Medicine and Therapeutics there and Associate Physician at Duke Hospital. Dr. Hendrix is said to be
vitally interested in Davidson’s athletic program and is regular in attending sports events here.
