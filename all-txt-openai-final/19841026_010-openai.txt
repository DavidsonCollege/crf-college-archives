The Davidsonian’s First Ever Photography Contest ended this past Wednesday. Thirteen different photographers submitted a total of 24 entries — 21 student and three faculty photos. The submission deadline was this past Sunday.

The photos were each ranked on a scale of one to 100 in five areas by three independent judges, and a perfect score was 1500. The areas were creativity, originality, technical precision, artistic appeal, and overall excellence. The judges were English Professor Frank Bliss, Assistant Director of Communications Bill Giduz, and Quips and Cranks photography editor, Jane Campbell.

Only six of the entries received scores above 1200. The winner was junior Julie Danek with her 1294-point serpent. Second place went to William Naso’s 1258-point “self-portrait,” and Virginia McGee took third place with the girl on the sidewalk which earned 1243 points. Christian Hagberts and Jim McGruder took the other photos that earned over 1200 points.

Anderson Scott’s “Vincent House” was chosen as the winner in the faculty category.

Winners will receive gift certificates to Charlotte's Camera World — $50 for the first place entries, $25 for second place, and $10 for third place.

Winning photographs are (clockwise) by Julie Danek, Virginia McGee, Anderson Scott, and William Naso.
