**Features Liner Notes**

**Fusion excursion highly recommended**

By JEFFERY M. BROWN

**Kip Hanrahan Vertical’s Currency American Clave -1010**

Kip Hanrahan is a breath of fresh air in a musical world inundated with Top 40 dross. As producer and percussionist, he has taken up the weighty task of shattering the cultural barriers that resist any attempt to successfully fuse jazz, rock, salsa, and funk. His solution takes the form of the proverbial ‘melting pot,’ a union of ethnically diverse musicians committed to promoting a unique world music.

Hanrahan’s latest excursion into the currents of cross-cultural “fusion” picks up thematically where the intoxicating *Desire Develops An Edge* left off. Therein the artist examined in depth the themes of sexual tension and interpersonal conflict. *Vertical’s Currency* addresses similar themes, but does so in a more consistent fashion. Specifically, Hanrahan now utilizes a more permanent body of musicians, eschewing the ever-changing ethnic roster that performed on *Desire*. Essentially, the present ensemble consists of vocalist/bassist Jack Bruce of Cream fame, tenor saxophonist David Murray, percussionists Ignacio Berroa and Milton Cardona (as well as Hanrahan), and guitarist Arto Lindsay.

*Vertical’s Currency* is a dark, introspective work that reveals a thematic consistency and coherence. Hanrahan has a story to tell, a story that evolves around the search for emotional and sexual satisfaction in the midst of a relationship quickly decaying into ruin. The quest is provocative and often disturbing, but always engaging and beautiful. Jack Bruce sings brilliantly on the album, evoking a keen sense of pathos and emotional longing. His rendition of Steve Swallow and Kip Hanrahan’s “A Small Map of Heaven” is haunting, spiritually moving, heartfelt. He sings, “...and, just for that moment, he thought he saw an image of stillness somewhere in her eyes, a reflection of something so far in her, a light from a place he could never afford to reach.” David Murray’s stirring saxophone solo takes us out on a torrent of emotional fury.

From out of nowhere arises the blistering “Shadow Song” (Mario's In), a salsa number replete with orchestra and Bruce’s intense vocals. The most rhythmically powerful song on the album, “Shadow Song” stands as one of the most scorching performances of the year. Notice Bruce’s breathy anticipation, the furious horn lines, and Murray’s razor-like saxophone. Hot!

“Smiles and Grins” features Bruce singing at a blinding tempo to delightful lyrics. “So don’t regret the cars that rust, everything must turn to dust/ Cultivate and dig your craft: nights are hard when you’re gone soft.”

“Two-Heartedly” epitomizes the album's central themes, emotional and sexual discontent. The lyrics speak for themselves. “He feels her too closely. He loves her two-fistedly... He hurts her too consciously... He kissed her too fraternally. He eased her too cheaply. She goes.”

The decay of the relationship, the search for love and purpose amid nothingness, characterizes the remainder of the album. The search for love and sex on “Make Love”: “Every day drive my mind through the madness, I want to make love to you... Every day when I’m chasing the hours, I want to make love to you.” The nature of deception and shattered communications in “One Casual Song (After Another)”: “Contradicting every enclosed space, you might tell me a story that proves that I’ve never known you.” The quality of desire and resentment in “Intimate” distances: “You resent me for the way I displace you, but you need me for the darkness you'll find in me.”

Hanrahan’s music is not for everyone. Accessibility is not his overriding concern. His efforts do, however, offer the adventurous listener an oasis of swift Latin rhythms, jazz flurries, marvelous singing, and above all, intelligence. Highly recommended.

**Husker Du retains raw sound; soundtrack strong**

By LEE EICHELBERGER

**Husker Du Candy Apple Grey Warner Bros. 25385-1**

Husker Du? To those who have not heard of this group, you might think the name sounds like a new German dish. Actually, that's not too far off the mark, for this Minnesota trio is a real delicacy. For the past few years, they made their mark on the American club scene and last year they finally broke through onto a major label. *Candy Apple Grey* is that album; a rough-edged, broad revision of post-punk hardcore music.

The album opens conservatively with “Crystal,” a typical hardcore romp in the mold of early X. But by “Sorrow Somehow” it is clear that Husker Du's intentions have changed from their last release. The songs following are based not only in sixties garage punk but in the pop from that same era. In addition, hints of R&B ooze in behind the blazing guitar overdrive. But they don’t stop here, for the band goes on to embrace styles that one would not associate with hardcore. “Too Far Down” and “Hardly Getting Over It” employ acoustic guitars, melancholy melodies, and Dylanesque lyrics. Most surprising though is “No Promise Have I Made,” a haunting piece that uses blended voices accompanied by piano.

The success of the album may be partially attributed to the lack of interfering production by band members Bob Mould and Grant Hart. The mix retains the raw energy of live performance plus light studio refinements. The final result is that Husker Du have set their sights past the bars which have housed them for years and expanded their sound into the realm of greater accessibility.To say that Husker Du have sold out to pop. This album is by no means in the music mainstream. However, by embracing various styles, this band has managed to expand their style and enrich it at the same time.

Pretty In Pink Original Movie Soundtrack

Ever since the success of the Flashdance and Footloose albums, movie soundtracks have been the hippest thing since MTV. Unfortunately, this flood of soundtracks has typically been fractured allusions to the movies that spawned them. I saw Pretty In Pink and was not notably impressed; however, since movies are not my department, I will leave it at that. Unlike the movie, the soundtrack stands strongly on its own as a broad collection of some exceptional contemporary pop. John Hughes has succeeded in assembling numerous artists ranging in styles from Jesse Johnson’s funky rock to Suzanne Vega’s neo-folk to New Order’s electronic jungle on a single disc. Of course, in a collection so varied, little unity would be expected, yet the surprise here is that this collection creates the excited, tense atmosphere that the movie only hinted at. Vega’s “Left Of Center” pulls you into her swirling intensity, and Johnson’s “Get To Know Ya” throws you back out and onto the dance floor. OMD’s “If You Leave” soothing melody deceives with its unsettling lyric. Other good tracks include newcomer Danny H. Hitter’s “Wouldn’t It Be Good,” Echo and the Bunnymen’s “Bring On the Dancing Horses,” and the chilling “Please, Please, Please Let Me Get What I Want” by the Smiths. The only real disappointment is the remix of the title track by the Psychedelic Furs, which seems flat and contrived in comparison to the original. Throughout the record, recurring themes of tense frustration and uncertainty unify the album. It is encouraging to see an example of a successful and thoughtfully assembled soundtrack. It is, however, rare to find one that surpasses in depth and satisfaction the movie that it was made to support.

Dining Adventures

The Korner Pub: A Davidson classic

By TREY JAMMES and TORREY HYATT

It is 3 p.m. and you are cruising towards Mooresville when you notice a parking lot with a BMW, a white Camaro, and a tow truck. An inquisitive soul, you venture in. As the gravel comes to a slower crunch beneath your tires, you admire the exquisite plywood facade fronting the cinder block roadhouse. You have second thoughts. But, adventurous diner that you are, you cautiously open your door and approach the mouth of this innocuous monster. Your trembling hand slowly swings back the screen door and you take one tentative step into the beast. Immediately you are obliged to sidestep the random thrust of a broom wielded by the fabled folk here of greater Davidson, NC. He is, of course, Flapjack. Having parried his skillful attack, you are drawn to the bar, mesmerized by the subtle beauty of Alice, the proprietress of this establishment, a strong but gentle lady of the Carolinas. But halfway to your stool, you are apprehended by the mighty jaws of Champ The Watchpuppy clamped stubbornly to your shoelaces. Trying to look graceful, you proceed to the bar, dragging the little killer behind you. “Get ya’ somethin’,” she queries. Recovering your confidence, you reply, “A Bud longneck... and four quarters.” Downing your King of Beers in a gulp, you take your change and swagger over to the pool table, ready to take on all comers. But a sudden silence falls over the room, necessitating a deposit in the jukebox where your quarter purchases a round of REM and The Judds. As Vernon, the co-proprietor, taps his foot in approval, you resume your position at the billiards table. After a quick defeat at the unerring hands of the local shark, you drown your sorrows in three more Buds and ketchup-soaked fries. Feeling your body's need for more than these serrated Idaho wonders, you order one of the specially prepared Alice-burgers and a hotdog all the way minus the slaw. Nothing satisfies the indiscriminate munchies of the wayward Davidson student better than these down-home cuisinary master greases. Speeding along the digestion with another couple of Buds, you decide to take on the Birdie King. Coach Slagle and Dr. Kazee join you on this winner-take-all cut-throat video tournament. But your mind-altered thoughts wander back to the pool game going on beside you. So clean, so perfect, the sharks duel in a skilled exhibition of green felt wizardry. The pure physics of it all — eight ball in the corner — it’s almost musical! Oh hell, get a grip on yourself. Your Humes-adulterated mind is running away with you. Maybe it’s time to get back to the old loft to sleep it off. As you reluctantly depart your newfound Xanadu, you must remember to pay your bill and grab your jacket. After these tedious details are taken care of, you head back to reality, Davidson College. But remember, don’t call him a cowboy until you've seen him ride. If the above appeals to you, check out the Korner Pub. It is located one mile north of Davidson on the right. Although you might want to avoid Pika and SAE nights, it is open every day from 3 p.m. to 1 a.m. Spend a day at this Davidson tradition, it is well worth your time.
