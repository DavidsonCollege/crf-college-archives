DAVIDSON’S OPENING POSTPONED ONE WEEK

It has been decided to postpone the opening of the college until Tuesday, the 13th of September. Please note the
change and let it be known as generally as possible. There are several reasons for the change. So far as
we can tell, with every department of our family and national life so disturbed, the prospects for the college are
good. The reasons for postponement have almost entirely to do with the convenience of the students and their home people.
The first week of September, our regular opening time, will see a tremendous movement of troops. The 13th comes between
the first and second movement. Many students need the extra week this fall to get their farm and other work
in as good shape as possible before leaving. The other colleges of our section open the week of the 13th.
The very unrest due to the draft and the war generally has kept many from definitely deciding as to their
course, and the extra week will give them time to decide.

IMPORTANT CHANGES MADE IN A.B. COURSE

The change made in the A.B. course is as follows: Change the B.S. 1 course to A.B. 2, requiring students
to take either Greek or Latin, and either French or German. One of the foreign languages must be taken two
years, and four years of foreign language altogether must be taken in the Freshman and Sophomore years.

MR. W. I. HENDERSON DIES IN CHARLOTTE

The many friends of S. T. Henderson, '17, will be grieved to hear of the death of his father, Mr.
W. I. Henderson, on the 28th of August. Mr. Henderson had been ill for the past year and his death
was not entirely unexpected. He was a native of Mecklenburg County and a resident of Charlotte for the past twenty
years. Mr. Henderson was a deacon in the Second Presbyterian Church at the time of his death.

O wooden pews, O wooden pews!
How many pastors have the blues
Because the people will refuse
To occupy you, wooden pews!
