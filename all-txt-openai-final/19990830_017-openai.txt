Fresh off record-setting season, ’Cats trek to Morehead St.
By Mike ANDERSON

On November 14, 1998, the Wildcat football team made history as the winningest installment in the program’s 101 years, posting
a remarkable record of 8-2. Davidson football broke onto the I-AA NS (non-scholarship) scene last year with a bang, finishing
fifth in the nation in their first season since upgrading from Division III.

The successes of '98, however, have created a new set of challenges for ‘99. This Thursday night, after 292 days
of waiting, the ‘Cats will take the field again—looking to answer the biggest question they face this fall: Was last
year’s 8-2 season a fluke? Or was it merely the most notable (not to mention, glorious) sign of a vastly
improving program?

In his sermon at DCPC on Sunday, President Vagt urged the congregation to constantly strive toward the future, because life
can be remarkably downhill if “the crowning jewel of your life is something that you have done in the past.”
Surely a poignant message to the Wildcat football squad as they embark on the ’99 season.

Head Coach Tim Landis’s squad travels to Morehead, Kentucky, for their season opener this week against one of the toughest
opponents in recent Wildcat history. Morehead State (who once fielded retired NFL great, Phil Simms) finished 1998 with a program-best
9-2 record, garnering a first-place rating in the Football Gazette poll of Division I-AA NS schools.

“It’s a tall order,” Landis admits. “(Morehead State is) very talented. They’ve got more size than us, they’re a bit
faster, and they’re deep. They've just come down from a fully-funded status, which means they’re still competing with some scholarship
athletes.”

It was once said there are no great people in this world, only great challenges that ordinary people rise to
meet. Landis and his ‘Cats hope to add this rigorous schedule of opponents to the list of great challenges his
program has risen to meet this decade.

“We want to build on last year’s season. We're on a roll,” says Landis. “That’s a lot to be excited
about.”

“Last season raises your expectations,” agrees Tripp Merritt, the ‘Cats’ Associate Head Coach and defensive coordinator. “(But) the guys are
pumped, they’re ready to go.”

It’s all about the “D.”

A key for the ‘Cats this season, as it has been in the past, will be their defensive performance. The
’98 season was spearheaded by a nationally-renowned defensive squad that allowed but 10.4 points per game (Davidson’s best points-against average
in 44 years), earning them the nation’s fourth-best defense.

The '99 defense will be built around the cornerstone of nose guard Bo Henderson. The 6’0” 220-lb. junior from Garinger
High in Charlotte led the ‘Cats last season with 94 tackles and 7 sacks. Coach Merritt praises, “(Henderson) made pre-season
All-American, and he is at the peak of his game. He’s even faster and stronger than he was last year.”

While Henderson rallies the defensive front, look for Donnie Johnson to key the secondary. Johnson, who will start at the
left corner position, racked up five interceptions last season, contributing to the nation’s best pass defense among I-AA NS schools.

This defense will be tested early, as Morehead State features perhaps the most multi-talented offensive scheme the ‘Cats will face
this year. “You name it, they run it,” said Coach Merritt. “They have a very effective option game, and they
do so many things that they really keep you honest.”

Eagle quarterback David Dinkins re-wrote the school’s record books last season, surpassing the marks for total offense in a game
(482 yards), total offense in a season (2,981 yards), best rushing average in a season (8.0 yards per carry), longest
run from scrimmage (89 yards), most points in a season (122), and most touchdowns in a season (20).

Hitting Their Stride

On the opposite side of the ball, Davidson enters its second season undera newly-installed offensive scheme. “This is our second
year in the spread-option offense,” says Landis. “We made headway with it last year, but it’s complex and we've just
scratched the surface. With seven offensive starters back, we should continue to progress.”

A key to that progress will be senior fullback Eric Ferguson. Ferguson, considered among the best in I-AA football, ranks
second in Davidson history for career yards with 1,818. Another major piece of the puzzle will be the play of
junior quarterback Shaun Tyrance, who spent much of last season sidelined with a torn ACL.

Could there be more? Fresh off the record-setting season, two more landmarks are on the line as the ‘Cats open
up 1999. A victory over Morehead State would extend their winning streak to eight games, tying a record that dates
back to World War I. And a winning season in '99 would make '98-'99 the first consecutive winning seasons since
the 1950s. The opportunity to achieve that feat has Landis and the football program aglow.

“We could break the record for consecutive wins, and you’ve got to go back to 1924-26 to find a better
three-year record than we’ve had over the past three years,” says the seventh-year head coach. “I’m more enthusiastic about this
job than I’ve ever been.”
