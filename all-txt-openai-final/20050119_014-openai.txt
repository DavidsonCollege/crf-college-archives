in dual matches. Before coming to Davidson, Jaworsky was an assistant at his alma mater, the University of North Carolina,
for four years. While a wrestler at UNC, Jaworsky solidified himself as one of the best wrestlers in the school’s
history by winning three straight NCAA individual championships. In 1995, Jaworsky was named the Outstanding Wrestler of the NCAA Tournament,
and in 2003 he was named one of the top 50 male athletes in ACC athletic history. Jaworsky also finished
third at the 2000 U.S. Olympic Trials.

Regarding Jaworsky’s firing, it is Davidson policy to not discuss personnel matters or anything related to Jaworsky’s dismissal. “Most organizations
hold personnel issues as private,” said Athletic Director Jim Murphy.

Coach Jaworsky guided the ’Cats to a 5-42 record during his tenure.

“If a future prospective employer or a former employer calls, any discussion surrounding a personnel decision is forbidden.” The process
involved is itself somewhat complicated. A decision on the dismissal of a staff member must be made by the Athletic
Director, College President, and the Board of Trustees. “There are some broad actions that lead to termination: major violation of
an NCAA rule, commission of a felony,” said Murphy. “The decision to hire, retain, or terminate is made by a
supervisor. We discuss collectively, and make a decision based on that.”

Although familiar with the process itself, Murphy stressed how rare it is to dismiss a staff member in this manner.
“It’s rare that something occurs like this,” he said. “This type of situation has not occurred in my tenure, and
I’ve been athletic director for ten years.”

Replacing Jaworsky is his top assistant, interim head...Coach Bob Patnesky is in his second year at Davidson after a successful
wrestling career at West Virginia University.

“I took over as coach,” he said when asked about the process. “I think they did what they could. I
don’t know what else they could have done differently, [because] the whole situation was very weird. I was told to
do this, and I accepted.”

“It’s difficult to talk about this,” added Patnesky. “[Jaworsky] is a real good friend of mine, and he gave me
my job. It’s tough to discuss this situation.”

For the time being, Patnesky has been named interim head coach, but it is not clear if he will be
coming back in the same capacity next season.

“He is the coach at least through the end of the season,” said Murphy. “Given that we are in season,
the decision with Coach Patnesky had to be made immediately.”

“We haven’t talked about it yet,” said Patnesky of his future at Davidson. “Right now, my job is to take
care of the kids. The main focus right now is to finish the season strong, and achieve the goals of
every wrestler on the team.”

“I have great confidence in Coach Patnesky and his ability to lead the team. Patnesky has been our assistant coach
for two years, he was directly involved with managing the team, and that made him the logical choice,” added Murphy.

“[Coach Patnesky] is a great coach,” said wrestler Drew Carey ’06. “He knows what he’s doing in the room and
on the mat. He’s been with us long enough to know how to push us and when to push us.”

While his future at Davidson may still be up in the air, Patnesky is wasting no time in recruiting for
the Cats’ future on the mat.

“The main focus right now is on wrestling and recruiting,” said Patnesky. “All the recruits will have a significant impact
on the team, whether it be adding depth or starting right away. We’re pretty solid in six or seven weight
classes, and the recruiting focus is on the heavier weight classes.”

As for this season’s results, Davidson is off to one of its best starts ever. The ’Cats won six straight
to open the season, including a win against nationally-respected Duquesne, propelling them to their best start in 38 years.

“Beating Duquesne was a big step,” said Patnesky. “It made [the wrestlers] realize that all their hard work was paying
off. They felt that their backs were against the wall, and they decided to do it.”

The team rallied together to overcome adversity at the start of this year. This success, said Carey, had to do
with “hard work, confidence, and character.”

Patnesky, too, is quick to compliment the team on their success. “Everybody on the team plays a significant role in
each individual way. They all do their part in a significant way. Our team is 10 individual pistons, and they
fire as one. If one piston shorts out, the other nine pick it up.”

Patnesky and Carey both acknowledged, however, that this success directly had to do with Jaworsky’s positive involvement with the program
over the past few seasons.

“He completely turned [the program] around,” said Carey, when asked about Jaworsky’s legacy.

“[Coach Jaworsky] did a great job,” added Patnesky. “It is indescribable what he did for the program, and he set
that standard.”

As for the future of Wildcat wrestling, Patnesky is thinking big. “We have all intentions of being the best we
can be, of winning a Southern Conference Championship, and to promote the sport of wrestling to the highest level it
can be,” he said. “I want to teach the kids life skills, what it takes to be successful, and give
them guidance.”

On Wednesday, Jan. 19, the Wildcats host UNC-Greensboro at 7 p.m. This marks Davidson’s first Southern Conference match of the
year.
