8 The Davidsonian SENIOR ADS

Alexandra Lily Robinson

Just as wonderful, but now with a degree instead of a woolie!
You are my ray of sunshine every day. As you leave Davidson, you
take with you amazing friendships, knowledge, and self-awareness.
I am so proud of all you have accomplished, and all that you have
given.
Congratulations Alex!
I love you always,
Mom

Congratulations, Phill

Talk about courage under fire!

Love,
Mom and Dad
