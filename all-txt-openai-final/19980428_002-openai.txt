Knoller and Stuntz win the Vereen Bell Award
By Carrie Arthur, Staff Writer

On Apr. 21, Thomas Mallon presented the Vereen Bell Award for Writing, what English professor Tony Abbott called “the oldest, most prestigious award” for writing. Senior Jennifer Knoller and sophomore Cornwell Scholar Jim Stuntz shared first place for prose and poetry. Junior Jason Ferris, a Cornwell scholar, and senior Abigail Bergsma shared second place for their fiction and poetry respectively. Juniors Cintra Pollack and Vic Brand received Honorable Mention. Previous winners include Sheri Reynolds, Charles Wright, Robert Gwynn, Rachel Newcomb, Shayna Bat Hesed Chazin, and Jack Livings. Poet Robert Hill Long won second place in 1975.

Knoller is an English major. Mallon described her short story “Amy’s Fish” as “a quietly persuasive story of how every small cruelty creates another.” Knoller has been writing since sixth grade, and she plans to continue after graduation. She won second place in the Vereen Bell Award during her sophomore year. Her favorite genre is the short story, but she occasionally writes poetry, and her dream is to write a novel. Knoller’s subject is small spiritual revelations: She likes “finding little moments of beauty in the mass chaos of the world.” Knoller said that she would love to publish her work, but that she hasn’t submitted anything yet. So far, her only publications have been in her high school literary magazine and her hometown magazine, “Macon Magazine.” Her other artistic interests include drama and singing (during high school) and playing the piano. Knoller has played the piano since she was young.five or six. After graduation, Noller is going to work for a PR firm in Atlanta. She has no definite plans, but she may go to graduate school for either teaching or creative writing. She knows that she wants to continue studying English. Of the English department at Davidson, Noller said, “I think that the creative writing classes at Davidson are amazing.” She strongly encourages students to take writing classes from the visiting professors.

Stuntz is currently abroad. Although it is unusual for a sophomore to win the award, Abbott said he has “already made a place for himself” on campus. Stuntz was a published writer before he came to Davidson, and he won the R. Windley Hall Award for freshmen.

The Vereen Bell Award began in 1947 in memory of Vereen Bell ‘32 by his friends and former college friends. This annual award is given to the student who presents “the best piece of original writing during the year.” Bell was born in 1911 in Cairo, Ga. His parents were Chief Justice R.C. Bell of the Georgia Supreme Court and Mrs. Jennie Vereen Bell. After he graduated from Davidson, he moved to Louisiana to study under the writer Fred Litten. He was the editor of the magazine American Boy for two years. Bell wrote two novels, articles, and short stories. Volume XXXV of The Davidsonian said that his first novel, “Swamp Water,” was a best-seller and adapted to film. The subject of both “Swamp Water” and his second novel “Two of a Kind” was outdoor life in Georgia. Many of his short stories and articles were published in national magazines. The Davidsonian said that “Bell was recognized as one of the South’s most outstanding writers.”

Bell entered the Navy in 1943. He died at the age of 33 while he was serving as the Air Combat Intelligence Officer for the Carrier Gambier Bay. The carrier was sunk by Japanese during a surprise attack in 1944. He was survived by his wife and two sons. His college roommate D. Grier Martin worked to establish the award, which was first given in 1947. The Davidsonian said that his friends and relatives wanted “to honor those traits of character that made him so popular throughout the country and to recognize his contribution to the American literary field.” The original fund contained $2,000 with a $50 prize for each annual winner. (At that time, the annual tuition for Davidson was $250.)

Each year, Abbott said that the English department brings in a “distinguished group of judges.” He feels that “bringing writers of this magnitude to the campus is very important. It means a lot to the students to have their work judged by writers of this caliber.” Abbott said that students also receive “outside contact with a well-known writer.” Previous judges include Robert Frost; Vereen Bell, Jr. ‘55; James Dickey, the poetry consultant of the Library of Congress; Robert Bly; Maxine Kumin, the 1973 winner of the Pulitzer Prize for poetry; Charles Wright ‘57, the 1998 winner of the Pulitzer Prize for poetry; Sam Ragan, the poet laureate of North Carolina; William Styron ‘46; and Sheri Reynolds ‘89.

Mallon is a nationally known author, essayist, critic, and editor. He was the editor of GQ. Author of six books, Mallon combines fact and fiction in his historic novels, “Henry and Clara” and “Dewey Defeats Truman,” to focus on what English professor Cynthia Lewis called “defining moments of history and their long-reaching consequences.” Lewis said one of his greatest strengths is his characterization.

“The Color of Fear” sparks discussion in 900 Room

By MELISSA ANN DE CASTRIQUE
News Editor

Last Thursday at 5:30 p.m. in the 900 Room, the movie “The Color of Fear” was shown, with a discussion of diversity following the film. The movie was presented by the Dean of Students’ office, and a free Lotus dinner was provided for the first 200 students in attendance.

“The Color of Fear” is a 90-minute documentary of a discussion among nine men of different races. These men, on a weekend retreat in California, discuss the effect of racism in their lives. As the discussion in the film progresses, underlying prejudices of all of the men are revealed. In particular, one white man, David, is seen as ignorant to racial issues by the men of color in the group. The other men try to provide examples to back their feelings and put their frustration in terms David can relate to. When David finally grasps that the other men’s concerns are real, a moment of breakthrough is felt by the entire group.

The film tackles other issues besides the white man’s ignorance. Racism among minorities was also brought to light. Some men are distressed that minorities seem to be pitted against each other. They state that Asians, particularly Chinese, are viewed as the “model minority.” All minorities in the group feel that this tension and stereotyping only serve to further alienate all minorities from whites. At the film’s end, all participants stress the importance of increasing nationwide recognition of these issues.

After the film, viewers discussed the importance of the film and the issues it raised. They also addressed diversity issues on the Davidson College campus. Several students later stated that they felt that the movie’s impact was so great that it should be mandatory for all Davidson students.
