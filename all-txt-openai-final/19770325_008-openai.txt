Proposal: Davidson students and faculty are dissatisfied with our budget "priorities."

Solution: Understand how the budget at Davidson works. Change the budget priorities from the physical—THE MARTIN SCIENCE BUILDING is among the top four priorities... all we need is plant and athletics to academics funds. Athletics dwarf Academics.

Frequently, complaints by members of the student body arise concerning the misdirection of funds by this school's administration. One of the more frequent complaints concerns the expenditures of the athletic department. In the public budget for 1975-76, the athletic department was listed as $509,644. But $618,818 was finally allocated to the department, and though this number includes salaries, it does not include game expenditures which can be estimated at $250,000-$300,000. As for figures concerning basketball and football alone, the administration did not disclose these.

The 1975-76 expenses for academic areas were listed as $123,723 (this figure encompassing those items listed as departmental, laboratories, language lab, and music department) or approximately 14.6 percent of the total athletic department. The reason given for this direction of funds is in part found in the minutes of the trustees meeting in February 1976: “Recognizing that a national level basketball program has raised the visibility of Davidson College across the nation, has promoted excellent school spirit among the student body, and has evoked generous financial response from alumni and friends, the trustees of Davidson College strongly reaffirm the commitment of the college to a national level intercollegiate basketball program.”

Carnegie guest house is another sore spot. According to comptroller Davidson, the money used for renovating the guest house could have been directed to the academic areas (rather than being funds specifically given for renovation). The reasoning behind the guest house, according to Dr. Spencer, is that, as with other cosmetic effects, it enhances the general atmosphere. Visitors would therefore feel more comfortable with the school and thus more apt to fork over some green. As for the brick sidewalks, in the long run they cost less as they need less repair work than would asphalt.

Meanwhile, the biology department budget hasn't risen in three years (though it doubled over the past five) while the number of majors has tripled and inflation for supplies is at a 25 percent rate. In fairness to the administration, it should be noted that a National Science Foundation grant was matched by the college which helped in purchasing the mobile lab. Looking at the other sciences, chemistry has nearly tripled in five years but it too has been nearly leveled for three years. Physics has been the most neglected, basically unincreased over five years; this year it still received $1300 less than requested. The international education funds were cut by 33 percent.

Of the professors questioned, the majority mentioned an obvious need for more funds, money that could be used for items such as outside speakers, more A.V. (especially for the languages), external examiners, and standardized tests. Several raised doubts concerning the direction of funds towards athletics. Martin Science Building is another area of conflicting views. While the school spends money renovating IMAC fields and installing an 18 kW radio station, Martin remains in a relatively stagnant condition. The rationale for this, as told to me by Dr. Spencer, is that by waiting until enough money has been collected to fix it up in one shot, it’s not worth the effort as various construction would...elsewise have to be done twice due to piecemeal renovation. As to why they can’t save the money that was used for, say, the IMAC fields is that this is part of the operating budget and therefore, according to comptroller Davidson, if not used within the year it must be listed as a profit. I don’t believe it should be thought that the administration is out to keep academics at a minimum for the sake of other areas. Mellon grants of $150,000 and $230,000 have been approved specifically for faculty and program development. Various other grants have also been directed towards the academics. The Booth Ferris grant helped in creating the new gallery and has also given the school its system of computer terminals. However, it does appear to me that the academic areas do not receive an appropriate share of the budget. Davidson College is supposed to be a learning institution and not a sports camp or holiday inn with a liberal arts education as a fringe benefit.

know about that.” The top priority major expenditures are funded through funds brought into the college from gifts and fundraising. “You take these (top) priorities,” said Spencer. “If the money coming in were all completely unrestricted you would have to make a determination of where the money would be spent.

“The realities of fundraising are that if you have projects as diverse as those that you try to identify prospects interested in those and you go out and try to raise the money for that. Priority as to which one gets built first may well be established by getting the interest of somebody willing to get the project on the road in a big way,” he said.

The college tries to raise money for all four areas at once, according to Vice President for Development Duane A. Dittman. “There isn’t one of those projects we don’t have proposals for,” he said. By setting one specific top priority the college would be shutting off possible revenues, according to Dittman. “If we said the Martin Science Building is the only priority we have we couldn't look for money for the arts building,” he said. “That’s one reason we don’t have a priority list.”

“Usually it doesn’t happen that someone comes and takes the initiative to come and give money to (a specific project),” said Spencer. “We take the initiative to go to these people and ask if they would be willing to donate to these projects.”

The college does not try to get people who offer to finance projects that are not top priority to finance the more important projects because “people want to make their biggest impact in their name to things they love,” said Dittman. The money used for small
