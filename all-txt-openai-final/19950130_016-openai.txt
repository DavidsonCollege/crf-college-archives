Wildcats cheer for tradition

By Joe Beach & Jason Burt

Once again we have been amazed by the spirit and enthusiasm of the average Davidson basketball fan. To each and every one of you who attended the game both Monday against Appalachian State and Saturday against Marshall — thank you. Believe it or not, you played an instrumental role in lifting the Wildcats to the victory over the Mountaineers. Although ASU is not expected to shake up the Southern Conference this year, they always seem to have our number (as evidenced by the four-game losing streak we had against them going into last week’s game).

Speaking as fans, we can’t say enough about how good it feels to stand in the midst of a roaring crowd and watch our conference foes fall before our team. Speaking for the players, they really do appreciate the effort and energy you expend at our home games. We think that we are well on the way to constructing our “House of Horrors.”

This week, both the men’s and women’s teams will be putting in the miles as they travel to meet varying conference foes. The women travel to Marshall tonight, while the men will swing by Georgia Southern tonight before returning home to attempt to continue their success at home in a key match-up against Western Carolina Saturday night.

Before Saturday night’s loss, the Wildcats are going to need your help in what could very well prove to be a preview of action to come in the postseason. Make your plans now, and be sure to include in them the most exciting basketball action this side of the Charlotte Coliseum.

We’d like to add just one more word — about tradition. Over the past four years, we have been witness to Davidson’s efforts to resurrect what was once a great basketball program. The result has been a system that has risen from a mediocre Big South team to a powerhouse in the Southern Conference.

Women’s hoops still scraping for conf. win

The women’s basketball team ran into Southern Conference leader East Tennessee State Saturday, and the Buccaneers played like it in the second half. After staying within 39-35 at halftime, the Wildcats couldn’t keep with ETSU and left Johnson City, Tenn., still searching for their first conference victory. Carolyn Kirsch led Davidson (4-14, 0-6 Southern) with 16 points, and Elizabeth DuBose added 12 points and six assists. ETSU (13-4, 6-1) had five players in double figures, led by Amy Engle (19 points). Justina McClellan had 17 points and ten rebounds, while DeShawne Blocker added 15 points and 17 rebounds.

Before last week’s losses to Tennessee-Chattanooga and Georgia Southern, the team finished up their tough non-conference schedule over the Christmas break and began league play. In the first game, at St. Francis, Penn., the Wildcats had a tough first half in terms of shooting, making only 25.8 percent of their shots. They improved some in the second half, as they hit for 41.9%, but still lost on the road. Kirsch and Jen Vanlerberghe led Davidson with 11 points each. Next, in Loyola, Md., Davidson fell behind by 15, and a late rally came up short as Davidson lost 67-56. Kirsch again played well, scoring 16 points.

While the coaches and players strive to rewrite Davidson’s name in the annals of college basketball, it is time for the fans of Wildcat basketball to do the same.basketball to build a tradition of our own.

The Wildcats finally returned home, and the change of scenery did them good as the team blew away Charleston 77-57. In that game, the Wildcats shot over 50 percent from 3-point land. Amy Scalcucci led the charge with 21 points, and Kristen Ferucci added 15. Against William & Mary, Davidson had a strong second half, but fell 83-65. Ferucci had 19 points, and Tonya Sharpe put in 17 for the game. The Wildcats then opened conference play on the road against Furman, but lost 82-64. Davidson was within two at halftime, but Furman shot 55% in the second period on the way to their victory. Four Wildcats hit double figures, led by Kirsch with 12 points. In their next conference game against Western Carolina, Davidson lost a heartbreaker, 81-77 in overtime. Western Carolina only managed 24 points in the first half, but sent the game into the extra period, where it outscored the Wildcats 14-10. Kirsch had a double-double with 17 points and ten rebounds, while DuBose had 12 and Vanlerberghe had 19. The women’s team returns to action tonight, playing on the road against Marshall.
