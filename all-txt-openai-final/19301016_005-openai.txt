Oberlin College to Study World Peace

Students of Presbyterian College in Ohio Inspired by Address of President

Oberlin, Ohio—More than seven hundred Oberlin College undergraduates have formed the Oberlin Peace Society, an organization which evolved from a chapel address made by Dr. Ernest Hatch Wilkins, president of the college, and one which the student leaders hope will spread, in one form or another, to all the colleges and universities of the country. Many of the students who joined the society pledged themselves to do special research work in problems of peace and war in an effort to arrive at an intelligent solution of the problem.

The address which inspired the formation of the society was one in which President Wilkins expressed the belief that colleges ought to make the study of peace one of their main subjects. Warning the students that this generation, although due the credit for starting the movement for world peace, will never see the culmination of their work, Dr. Wilkins continued:

“I have imagined that for a period of seven years Oberlin might devote itself to an intensive study of this problem—elementary work in all departments to continue in the normal way, advanced work in all or nearly all departments to concentrate very largely on the common theme. Thus the department of history would study the sheer facts of war; the departments of social science would study the causes of war and their correction; the departments of literature would deal with those works which set forth the experience of war as seen by men of genius who have shared in it; the departments of physics and chemistry would study the implications of physical and chemical warfare, and the departments of biology the implications of that bacteriological warfare which is all too possible; and the other departments would study the actual effects of war upon the body and the mind and the spirit of men.

“A monotonous and a ghastly program, you say? Yes, but less monotonous than the trenches; less ghastly than a city where a bomb has fallen.”

Literary Societies Have Good Programs Planned

Professor Williams to Talk at Eumanean—Davidson Traditions to be Discussed at Phi

The Eumanean and the Philanthropic Literary Societies have arranged two very interesting programs for their meetings to be held on Tuesday night, October 21. At Eu hall, Professor John P. Williams will speak on the subject, “Business of Today,” and M. W. Norfleet will discuss “The Importance of the Essentials of Parliamentary Law.”

Professor Williams will give a very interesting and comprehensive talk on the different phases of business, including his interpretation of the present business depression and a clarifying discussion on the stock market. The business administration head has a keen insight on financial problems and will probably explain many of the intricacies of Wall Street, which he knows thoroughly. Norfleet is well versed in rules of formal procedure and will offer many instructive hints to literary society participants.

The program at the Phi hall includes four talks by students: “The Early History of Davidson,” by Jack Mathews; “The Story of the Davidson Seal,” by B. McClure; “The Story of the Chandelier,” by R. D. Russel; and “The Stories Told Concerning the Columns of Old Chambers,” by M. F. McDavid. Few subjects can be found more interesting to students than these, dealing with the traditions of Old Davidson.

Students Selected To Lead at Chapel

For the past two years it has been the custom for the students to lead the chapel exercises alternating with the members of the faculty. Beginning October 14th, the following students will lead the chapel exercises:

October 14th—R. D. Russel
October 16th—Bill Flenn
October 18th—Jack Mathews
October 20th—Archie McLean
October 22nd—Jas. A. Jones

No arrangements have yet been made for the remainder of the year, but the students will continue alternating with the members of the faculty in carrying on these exercises.

Annual Pictures

Out of two hundred and sixty photographs taken by the Annual photographer, one hundred and sixty-two proofs have been returned. The majority of these proofs have been good, so it seems that greater satisfaction will be given this year. Everyone is urged to have their picture taken when the photographer returns here, about November 1, so that if they are not satisfied the pictures may be taken again in time to get in the Annual.his next trip the photographer will take pictures of some of the groups, the others to be taken later.

a regular on last year’s varsity and these two now alternate with Carlisle. Holland and Oglesby started at the tackle berths with Johnson and Watts at guards. The most difficult position that Coach Floyd had to fill was at center and for a while he had moved Oglesby over to this position, but against V. M. I. Cantrell started in the pivot position. The veteran backfield of Wilson, Jennings, Chapman, and McIntosh started things in the last tilt and with the possible exception of Whittington for Jennings the same quartet will face the Wildcats Saturday.
