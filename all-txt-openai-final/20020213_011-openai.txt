"I feel like I’m in Miami," said Sketch-ball.

"That’s only because your hot waitress doesn’t speak English well."

So went the first few minutes of our conversation at Kobe Asian Grill, which just opened its Davidson doors on Main Street last week. Brian “Sketchy” Akin ’04 joined us at the Asian-inspired restaurant for a quick lunch. While the waitress may have been hot, and while her English may have been subpar, we most certainly were not anywhere that vaguely resembled Miami. Akin later claimed that his “Miami” comment referred to the restaurant’s Art Deco style, but seeing as there is nothing Art Deco about Kobe, we’re left only to wonder about his skills as an interior designer.

There’s not much in the way of decoration at Kobe: a few small wall lights, track lighting, and what’s meant to be trendy silver chairs. To be fair, it’s only the restaurant’s first week of business. The bar is not finished, regular Coke was unavailable, and touchups were done as we ate. But let’s not complain too much. Kobe isn’t trying to be the highbrow restaurant of the Davidson area. For just $6.50 for a filling meal, we think we’ll find ourselves eating lunch across Main Street a lot more than before Kobe’s opening.

The lunch menu is short: grilled chicken, fish, shrimp, steak, or vegetables, each at $6.50 a piece. Each lunch also comes with a salad, a generous serving of fried rice, and what we’re pretty sure were canned carrots. Yummy. Not that yummy, but yummy enough. The shrimp looks more like krill and probably doesn’t taste too different. The chicken is what you’d expect: a few small cubes of white meat goodness. We both agree that the steak is your best bet. We didn’t try the fish or vegetable dishes.

The nice thing about Kobe, though, is its very relaxed atmosphere. (Don’t confuse this Kobe with the one of the same name in Cornelius.) You’d feel comfortable finishing up the reading for your 1:30 class while picking the tomato out of your ginger salad. Meals are also served quickly, so there’s plenty of time to run to Kobe in between classes.

We’re not culinary experts. We’re the guys who eat three corndogs a day more often than three square meals a day. We’re also the guys who like to eat a lot for $6.50. At Kobe, you can eat a lot for $6.50. So, if we like eating a lot for $6.50, and since you can eat a lot at Kobe for $6.50, I guess that means we like Kobe. Yay, Kobe.

### Oscars, from page 8

Most well-rounded group. Each of their films displays a distinct style characteristic of great directing. The nominees are as follows: Robert Altman (Gosford Park), Ron Howard (A Beautiful Mind), Peter Jackson (The Lord of the Rings), David Lynch (Mulholland Drive), and Ridley Scott (Black Hawk Down). The only surprising thing about the best picture nominees is that only some of their creators were nominated for direction. While best picture nominees A Beautiful Mind, Gosford Park, and The Lord of the Rings were nominated in the directing category, the other two nominees — In the Bedroom and Moulin Rouge — were left off the directing list. I quote Ty Burr: “One is tempted to cry out, as Billy Crystal did when referencing the similarly abused Prince of Tides director Barbra Streisand, ‘Did this film direct itself?’”

This year’s Oscar nominees aren’t all that bad; I’m tempted to say they’re good. There were a few pleasant surprises — any nominated comedic performance...(i.e. Zellweger’s) is a pleasant surprise — and a few unexpected disappointments: there’s the absence of Steve Buscemi and the lone nomination for Mulholland Drive. But at least the Academy didn’t name any undeserving nominees as they did last year. Gladiator anyone?

“What did happen was pretty scary though! Some imaginative (and possibly crazy) fans decided to pull up the floorboards that were covering the ice of the rink, and use them as giant crowd surfing boards. I think this trick was developed during that infamously rough Woodstock ’99, and no one expected it to surface indoors tonight!! This is some seriously dangerous stuff. I learned the hard way when one of the boards came over the barricade and bashed me in the back of the head in the fog of ‘Only In Dreams,’ which made me whack my nose on the videocamera and get a bloody nose and a huge headache...”

This was written by a photographer at the Weezer concert on February 5 in Cricket Arena. The photographer had a rough night, but I would have to admit that he was one of only a few concerned about the “Woodstock-like” crowd surfing that occurred at the Weezer show. Prior to the main show, Saves The Day, along with Ozma, created a lot of energy in Cricket Arena. Soon after, Saves The Day pleasantly surprised me with their set and after a considerable delay because of a broken barricade, Weezer took the stage in front of a hyperactive, quasi-controlled audience. Opening with “Island in the Sun” from their Green Album, Weezer got everyone excited about all the songs to be played later.

As the show continued, the audience became more rowdy, eventually crowd surfing on wooden floorboards, as described by the cameraman. By this point in the show, I was finally comfortable, and I enjoyed my spot in the front and center of the arena. And despite my distance from the chaotic mosh pit, I could see that the crowd’s energy would last until the end of the show. To close the concert, Weezer played their all-too-familiar hit “Say It Ain’t So” along with “Hash Pipe,” “Only in Dreams,” “Buddy Holly,” and “Surf Wax America.” It was clear that everyone enjoyed the concert from beginning to end. We were all “stoked,” and we had nothing on our minds but Weezer.

Of course, alcohol and marijuana impaired some of our abilities to fairly judge the quality of the music, but one thing is clear: Weezer, at least in my mind, now stands in a league of its own. You have to give an all-male band credit for playing a song called “Tired of Sex.” On a related note, not only is Weezer underplayed, but the band is also underappreciated, especially in the college scene where most guys prefer to pick up girls by playing the Dave Matthews song they learned when they were fifteen. I think that we all have heard the same guitar licks way too many times. It is about time to show Weezer, and local bands, a lot more support.
