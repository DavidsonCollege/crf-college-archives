**Tale Of 'Cat Nine -- Defeat; Topped By USC, Belmont**

By BOB DUNHAM
Sports Editor

The Wildcat baseball team continued this week in its seemingly endless search for a victory, as it fell to South Carolina and Belmont Abbey. According to 'Cat coach Tom Stevens, the team was simply unable to put all of the elements of winning baseball together at the same time. "We have good pitching at times," said Stevens, "and at others we have good batting and fielding. But we can't get all three to work together."

Yesterday's contest with South Carolina found the Wildcats playing good defense, but unable to put together good hitting or pitching attacks. "We had seven hits," Stevens said, "but they were scattered. We left eight men on base, and you just can't win unless those men score." South Carolina tore into the 'Cat pitchers in the 5-2 triumph. Southpaw Clark Nickerson started the game, but lasted only three innings before Stevens pulled him to put in Macky Reavis. The Gamecocks picked up nine hits in the contest and took advantage of the few Wildcat errors to pick up their scoring. Davidson picked up one run in both the eighth and ninth innings. The first tally came with pinch hitter David King's single, while the second resulted from a USC wild pitch.

Monday afternoon the 'Cats put together a good hitting attack, but under a faulty field they fell to Belmont Abbey 13-6. "We really should have won that game," said Stevens in commenting on the game in which Davidson lost a six-run lead. "We hit well enough to win, but once again we couldn't get the whole game going at once." King took the Belmont loss in relief, as the Abbey team blasted the 'Cat nine with 10 runs in the last three innings. Davidson's record now stands at 1-16, with the most important conference games left. "We can still take the conference," said Stevens, "since we have played only one conference game, but we're having player troubles, so it will be rough."

**Wildcat Fuzzballers Nip East Carolina, Wolfpack**

The Davidson tennis team took to the road early this week and returned home with victories over East Carolina and North Carolina State. The Wildcat netters swept both matches by wide margins, as they dumped ECU 7½-1½ and the Wolfpack 8-1. The East Carolina match Monday was halted by rainfall during the final doubles contest. With each team holding wins in one set in that match, the rain forced the split match. Coach Harry Fogleman said that the Pirate squad was much rougher than he had expected, and that team members were "very surprised" by the difficulty of the match.

Tuesday afternoon, the team swept all but one match from N.C. State in Raleigh. The victory upped the Davidson team record for the season to 14-1-1. Fogleman commented that Dan Hearon, who is still recovering from a back injury suffered in a match with East Tennessee State, played quite well in the Wolfpack match. Woody Faulk drew considerable praise from Fogleman for his play in both matches. In looking forward to the Southern Conference tournament next month in Lexington, Va., Fogleman is not overly optimistic, and said that it would be a very tough tournament. He has chosen his first two doubles teams for the tournament. Berner and Hatcher will take on the number one doubles competition, while Hearon and Faulk will pair for the number two competition.

**Tennis Jet Set Brings New Shape**

Drawing a larger crowd than usual, the Davidson tennis team played an exhibition match Wednesday afternoon—with a colorful addition. In the feature attraction, Davidson’s Woody Faulk teamed up with Sweden’s Ingrid Lofdahl (left) to play Davidson’s Sam Hatcher and America’s Stephanie DeFina. Miss Lofdahl is first ranked in Sweden, while Miss DeFina is the seventh ranked player from America. The Hatcher-DeFina team took the single set exhibition match 12-10. In a special singles contest, Davidson’s number one player, George Berner, took on America’s third-ranked Mary Ann Eisel. Berner emerged victorious, by a score of 6-2.

**16 Teams Ready To Run In Tomorrow’s Relays**

By KENT RHODES

Cinders will fly and undoubtedly records will fall tomorrow afternoon as Richardson Field becomes the site of the tenth annual Davidson Relays. Davidson, Pembroke, and Cumberland loom as the favorites to take the...Team title in the relays which will include competitors from 16 schools of the Piedmont area. Davidson coach Heath Whittle, coordinator of the relays, said that this year's competition should provide "the most interesting meet we have hosted." The Wildcat trackmen will be led by high-scoring individuals Greg Cox and Rick Lyon. The team also expects to pick up a high javelin finish from Wayne Huckel. Cumberland has two top teams in the 880 relay and the shuttle hurdles. The latter is a new event in which one runner runs a 120-yard high hurdle leg, tags another runner who runs the opposite direction over the hurdles, and so on for four men. The Cumberland cindermen are the defending champions in the relays, which Davidson has won seven years in the last nine. Other top performers are expected from Catawba and Mars Hill. Bill Griffin, last year’s winner in the shot put, will lead the Catawba team, while Mars Hill hopes to top his performance. Catawba also has an extremely tough sprint medley relay team. Other schools competing in the meet are Carson-Newman, Elon, Lenoir Rhyne, Appalachian State, Wofford, Presbyterian, High Point, Atlantic Christian, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, and Western Carolina University. Field events will begin at 1:30 p.m., with the track events beginning with the hurdle relay at 3:30 p.m.

The Kapps last Friday and demolished the ATO’s 22-5 in a make-up game on Tuesday. On Monday, the Machis pulled out a 6-5 win against the Kappa Sigs with a last-inning rally. The Sigma Chi victories have been distinguished by sound fielding, the strong pitching of Bob Lanier, and the hitting of Jerry Kroll and Fox DeMoisey. Meanwhile, the Delts picked up a forfeit victory over the Independents on Monday and demolished the Betas 21-1 on Wednesday. Home runs by Dave Moser House and the solid pitching of Kit ‘Chico’ Thompson won the Beta game for the Delts. The Sig Eps remained near the top of the standings with two victories and a loss this week. The SPE's were surprised by the Pi Kapps 11-8 on Monday. Several errors hurt the SPE’s while Frank Hefner's defense led the Pi Kapps. The short right field of field number two proved advantageous to the Pi Kapps, who punched numerous singles off SPE pitcher Gary Sigmon into the woods. The SPE wins were over the Sigma Nu’s 16-6, and the Phi Gamms 11-9 in a very important game. Bob Dunham pitched the Gamm win, as Sigmon and Craig Garner starred at bat and in the field. Besides their loss to the SPE's, the Gamms picked up victories over the Sigs and the Betas. Bob Apgar chalked up the 5-3 win over the Sigs as Hugh Baskin played a fine game as catcher, substituting for Gary Peklo. Peklo was the star in the 32-6 cremation of the Betas as he had six hits, nine RBIs, and played his usual sparkling game behind the plate. In another game this week, John “Midnight” Hanselman hit and fielded the ATO's to an 8-6 extra-inning victory against the KA’s. The KA’s won an extra-inning thriller as they eased by the SAE’s 11-10. Frank Gray was the winning pitcher and Romey Fisher hit two doubles and scored the winning run on some heads-up baserunning. The Pikas split two games this week. They beat the Sigs 9-1 as Tom Kastner pitched a five-hitter and Bob Pickens had four hits. They lost to the Nu’s 4-1 as Tommy Phillips allowed only two hits, both in the last inning. The Nu’s also beat the SAE’s 13-6 on Wednesday as Bob Dewell, Dave White, and Bruce Weidner led the attack. The softball schedule will resume Monday after a holiday today for Spring Frolics.
