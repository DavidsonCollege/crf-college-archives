Women’s lacrosse continued its winning ways this past Saturday with a huge triumph against the visiting squad from Belmont Abbey.
Davidson overwhelmed the competition by scoring 17 goals to the Crusaders’ five. For the first time since 2002, when the
team ended with a 5-12 record, the Wildcats have posted five wins. They now stand at an overall 2006 record
of 5-2, not even halfway through the season and with nine games remaining.

“We have had an amazing start to this season and much of it I attribute to the team working with
each other,” said Leslie Smith ’06. “When we step out on the field for each game we play for our
teammates, to back them up, and make them look good because we know that it is as a unit that
we will win the game. We have a lot of season left, and we will continue to be a force
to be reckoned with.”

“So far we have shown our extreme growth from last season and we are hoping to carry it through our
next two weekends of highly competitive games,” said Missy Gilbert ’06.

Eloise Grose ’06 led the squad with a career-high nine-point performance. She was the first player to score in Saturday’s
action, netting a goal 24 seconds into play off an assist from Callie Seymour ’09. Belmont Abbey responded with its
only lead of the game, scoring two in a row just minutes later. The ’Cats were able to tie it
up with a goal by Grose, then obtained the lead and kept it for a total of 11 straight goals
against the Crusaders. The visitors came close to evening it out again at 4-3, but the streak ended their chances
of a win against Davidson. With 16 minutes left to play and the score 15-3, the Wildcats defense allowed two
consecutive goals by Belmont Abbey to end the scoring for the day.

Scoring for the Wildcats were Grose with four, Kelly Finnigan ’08 with four, a career-high for her, Emily Diefendorf ’08
with two, Sarah Walker ’08 with two, and one each from Becky Horton ’09, Emily Palmer ’08, Seymour, Alex Eagan
’07, and Alana Vaughn ’07. Grose also contributed five assists and brought her point total to nine, a career-high. Goalkeeper
Leslie Smith ’06 had a strong showing with three saves in the game, her fifth win of this season. Davidson
outshot its competition 32-11, and the team had only 11 turnovers while the Crusaders allowed 18.

Next up for the Wildcats is a four-game road trip, beginning with George Washington on Friday at 3:30 p.m. The
team will then play Lehigh on Friday and Ohio University on Sunday.

Track has good showing at Charlotte Classic

Both the men’s and women’s team opened up their seasons with strong starts this weekend. The men opened their season
at the Charlotte 49er Classic, which took place in Charlotte on March 17 and 18, while the women traveled to
Greensboro, NC, to participate in the Aggie Challenge, hosted by North Carolina A&T. On the first day...of competition, the men
had three members place in the top 15 of their event. Douglas Noreen ’07 placed seventh in the 1500 meter
run, with a time of 4:00.55. Jonathan Baker ’06 and Lance Harden ’09 placed 13th and 14th, respectively, in the
5000 meter run. Baker crossed the line in 15:19.94 and Harden followed with a time of 15:20.24. Sam Morris ’08
recorded a team-best time in the 3000 meter run, completing the race in 8:52.06. He placed 18th out of 58
participants. “I think we were all excited to finally get the outdoor track season underway,” said Morris. “It was a
solid start for us.” Ryan Hubbard ’08 jumped 6.16 meters (20 feet, 2.50 inches) in the long jump, earning 20th
place. The men also had a strong showing on the field. Joe Taylor ’06 led the Wildcats in the javelin,
earning himself a top-10 spot with a throw of 38.65 meters (126 feet, 10 inches). Jim Walter ’07 placed ninth
in the discus, with a throw of 42.34 meters (138 feet, 11 inches) and Will Funderburg ’09 placed 13th in
the shot put, launching it 12.92 meters (42 feet, 4.75 inches).

At the Aggie Challenge, Allie Martin ’06 helped to lead the team by finishing second in the 3000 meters, in
a time of 10:21.79. Caroline Sanker ’09 finished right behind Martin, in a time of 10:24.15. Fourth place went to
another Wildcat, Lucy Rogers ’09, who finished ninth. The ’Cats posted other top finishers in the 800 meters and 100
and 200 meters. Colleen McKown ’08 crossed the line in the 800 in a time of 2:19.96, which earned her
a third place spot. Teammate Hilary Leister ’06 finished in eighth, with a time of 2:22.65. Other top-10 finishers included
Kim Colley ’09, who finished in the top-10 in the 100 and 200 meter sprints.

The men and women will travel to Clemson, S.C. to compete in the Clemson Relays this Friday. The men will
then head to Winston-Salem, N.C. on Saturday to participate in the Wake Forest Open.

On another note, last week’s article failed to mention that the women picked up many new school records in their
Southern Conference Indoor championships. Megal Atias ’08 placed fourth in the 3000 meters to pick up a record, while the
distance medley relay team comprising of Atias, McKown, Leister and Martin took fifth and a record. In the 60 meters
and the 200 meters, Colley beat the old Wildcat time, and teammate Jessica Chasen ’07 had a record in the
400 meters. “Our weakness right now, in regard to our conference standings, is at the field,” Atias said. “We are
very strong in the middle distance, distance and sprint events but our heptathlon and throwing athlete, Michaela Corr, is just
coming back from an injury and we missed her very much at indoor.” In addition, Sanker’s time for the 3000
meters, like Atias’, was faster than the previous record and with it she qualified for the USA Junior Nationals. The
meet was one of the best performances at indoor championships for the women. The editors of the sports section apologize
for the omissions.
