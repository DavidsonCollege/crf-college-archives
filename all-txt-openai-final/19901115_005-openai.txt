#### Art Student Integrates Themes of South Korea Into His Work
By DAVID MCPHERSON

The work of Se-Hoon Oh represents an autobiographical investigation of the artist’s childhood experiences in a small South Korean town
near Seoul. Most of the works are investigations of dream-like scenes in which the boundary between animate and inanimate objects
dissolves.

An important piece in terms of fusing the artist's identity with that of the landscape is "Conversation with the Mountains."
Se-Hoon depicts the crooked peak of Kwan-Ak mountain, which he would often talk to as a child. He uses flat,
brightly colored forms to symbolize the organic irregularity of the mountain and surrounding landscape.

Another work which suggests the artist’s communion with his surroundings is entitled "Streets of the Village." This work recalls the
melting psychological landscapes of Arshille Gorky in works such as "The Liver is the Cock’s Comb" (1944). Se-Hoon uses dripping
forms to create a surface which appears to be growing through its softening and merging of form.

"Pa-chul-bu," a term that roughly means maid, portrays a woman clad in baggy work pants. The figure emerges from a
warm undulating darkness, and Se-Hoon tempers any sentimental intimacy of the woman with short jagged brush strokes. Even in this
figure, the weather-worn toughness of an earthly form emerges.

Se-Hoon’s work borrows from a variety of modernist traditions, perhaps the most noticeable of which is Surrealism. Despite this debt,
he is able to invest these traditions with an artistic vision which is intensely personal. It is this vision which
makes Se-Hoon’s work rare in comparison to most student works, which often adopt stylistic forms but fail to convincingly transform
them for their own use. His vision has not found a permanent stylistic model, but the search has produced interesting
results. The confidence with which Se-Hoon knows himself and his abilities are promising signs for a young artist.

Se-Hoon's exhibit is currently on display in the Morrison Room in the College Union.

### The Incredible Ease of Well-Being: What Your Blood Pressure Means
By Marlo Cobb

I couldn’t give blood last Wednesday. I waited 45 minutes in line to be told that my blood pressure was
“too low.” As I looked at the nurse in disbelief, I realized that I wasn’t quite sure what the concept
of “blood pressure” actually meant, and why it meant wasted time for me. I knew it had something to do
with “systolic over diastolic,” but I wasn’t sure.

For the curious, blood pressure is the pressure under which the blood is pumped through the circulatory system. Blood pressure
varies among individuals and even from hour to hour in the same person, depending upon their activity level and their
level of nervous excitement.

A sphygmomanometer is the instrument with the arm cuff that they use to take your blood pressure. Blood pressure is
measured from the brachial artery of your arm. (Remember, arteries are the vessels that take oxygenated blood away from the
heart. Blood pressure is generally higher in arteries than in veins.) When the cuff is put over the brachial artery
and tightened, it compresses the artery. Meanwhile, the nurse is listening to your arm through a stethoscope. When the sound
of a pulse can no longer be heard, she or he slowly begins to release the air in the cuff
and blood begins to flow back through the artery.

When the pulse is first heard again, the nurse looks at the sphygmomanometer’s gauge, where the mercury has shot up
a tube to a certain height. The nurse then records this reading as the systolic pressure. Meanwhile, air is being
continually let out of the cuff, and at the point where a pulse can no longer be heard, the reading
on the gauge is recorded as diastolic pressure. Systolic pressure is the pressure at the time of a heartbeat. It
is the maximum blood pressure on the arterial walls. Diastolic is the minimum pressure, representing the time between heartbeats when
the heart is at rest.

Normal systolic pressure is somewhere between 120-150 mm. Hg. (mm. of mercury on the gauge). Normal diastolic pressure is between
80-100 mm. Hg. “Low blood pressure” is defined as systolic < 110, and diastolic < 70. It is associated with
exhaustion, weakness, dizziness, and feeling faint. Temporary low blood pressure can occur due to shock from injury, surgical operations, diabetic
coma, and insulin overdose, and also when giving blood.

In other words, I would have had a much higher chance of fainting had I given blood last Wednesday than
someone whose blood pressure appeared normal that day. “High blood pressure” is defined as diastolic > 90 mm. Hg. It
is associated with hypertensive heart disease and stroke. There are many causes of high blood pressure.Sure, here is the cleaned
OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

Sure, among them “organic” factors such as kidney disorders and thyroid and pituitary gland diseases. External factors include a diet
high in saturated fat, salt, and alcohol. High stress, a sedentary lifestyle, and obesity also can contribute to high blood
pressure. Heredity too, can be an important factor in determining whether a person has high or low blood pressure.

Backstreet Café Offers Nothing Out Of The Ordinary
— By HEATH HARDAGE

Your Campus Living Editors recently reviewed The Backstreet Café. We decided to focus on a college and since plan to
gain weight over Thanksgiving, spotlight on cranberry sauce. You’re once, i.e., three times a lady.

Sagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): Potato salad is for you! Individual will trip you. You will fall down.

Capricorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): What you thought to be a perfectly good life is actually a waste of human sperm
and egg. Scenario features lint.

Aquarius (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): Nobody knows the troubles you’ve seen. Jeans that previously fit don’t anymore because your butt is
too big from those brownies and double cheeseburgers.

Pisces (Feb. 19-March 20): Allow for misery, affliction. Next summer you will step in a yellow jackets nest while mowing
the lawn. You'll cut your fingernails too short.

Aries (March 21-April 19): A sandwich is a sandwich, but a mandwich is a meal. The bladder, the small intestine,
the duodenum, and the rectum are in your future. Emphasize toilet.

Cancer (June 21-July 22): The good news is that when you get beat up tomorrow morning, you won’t be hurt.
The bad news is that when you get beat up the day after, you will be hurt by someone smaller
than your little sister.

Leo (July 23-Aug. 22): Concentrate on the sun. Eyes will burn temporarily, but don’t worry—you'll be blind soon anyway. What
you can’t see won’t hurt you.

Virgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Stranger will say, “Don’t I know you?” You will say, “I don’t think so.” Stranger will
say, “Are you sure?” You will say, “Oh, I’m quite sure.” Stranger will leave saying thank you. You will scratch
your head and realize your wallet, watch, and pocket change are all gone.

Libra (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): There is only one, our decision was not a difficult one. Located just off Main Street
very close to the post office, The Backstreet Café offers basic standard food.

We split an appetizer of Pick-and-Peel Shrimp ($7.50), mainly because it was the most expensive appetizer on the menu because
The Davidsonian was picking up the tab. Eventually, a very small plate of tasteless shrimp arrived with an equally tasteless
cucumber dip. For $7.50 we had expected a Bucket O’Shrimp, served on a silver platter by one of Queen Elizabeth’s
personal footmen.

For the main entree, my fellow editor tried the Chicken Breast Sandwich ($5.95), which boasted Jack cheese, cucumber sauce, and
steak fries. It was declared passable, but the sauce was tasteless. Every restaurant has a chicken breast sandwich, we noted,
and better than most.

I decided to raise my cholesterol level by ordering the Spinach Omelette filled with Fresh Fruit, which turned out to
be a fairly generous omelette filled with fresh spinach. Overall, the food is passable and the service fairly slow. But
it was nothing I couldn’t have made in my own kitchen in about ten minutes. They used no special sauces
or spices to liven up the plain spinach filling. And though there was fruit to accompany the meal, it was
merely a few slices of banana and a few slices of apple, which reminded me of what my mother threw
in my lunchbox when I was late for school.

Our service was slow. My fellow editor and I waited for at least 5 minutes before being seated, and it
was only after I entered the interior and made my presence known that anyone acknowledged us. And right after the
meal, the check arrived. Right after! Emily Post would NOT approve of this major etiquette violation. It was obvious the
owner wanted us to eat and leave as soon as possible.

Backstreet’s decor pleases the eye: pretty posters and plants adorn the walls. Inside is neat and attractive. Discreet Adult Contemporary
music plays in the background (positive or negative depending on your musical penchant). You do get free drink refills. The
dessert mints are really good.

Overall, the food is passable and the service fairly slow. It is convenient to go to Backstreet, especially if you
are without transportation. But, at $19.43 for lunch for two people, you would do better to save your pennies and
go to somewhere like Catherine’s or Fenwick’s, two excellent establishments on Providence Road in Charlotte. Both of these restaurants boast
great ambience, service, and food for about the same price as the Backstreet Café.
