COLLEGE PRESS SERVICE

Folk Festival Coming to Davidson

By LISA GERRARD

Western North Carolina artists and musicians will gather their crafts and songs and head for Davidson College on Saturday, September
15.

The occasion is Davidson’s first folk festival, replete with storytelling, pottery demonstrations, dinner on the patio, and a concert by
Freyda & the Ataboys.

The College Union is hosting the event in conjunction with a poetry reading and workshop with Irish poet Derek Mahon.

Mahon, who has been labeled “the most significant Irish poet since Seamus Heaney,” will give a reading at 11 a.m.
in the 900 Room of the College Union.

Storytelling and demonstrations begin at 3 p.m. on the Union steps and patio.

Dinner starts at 6 p.m., and will be followed by the concert at 8 p.m.

In the event of rain, activities will be moved inside to the Union’s Morrison and 900 Rooms. Dinner is $3.50,
but all other events are free.

The acoustic band Freyda & the Ataboys will present the festival’s headline performance.

Group members Freyda Epstein and Ralph Gordon were longtime members of Trapezoid, an ensemble famous for its blending of contemporary
sounds and traditional American music.

Other members of the group are banjo player and Davidson alumnus Fred Boyce, and Bob Vasile on bouzouki and guitar.

Student coordinators Beth Willard and Monica Lide have also invited basket weavers, a clogging group, and a dulcimer and autoharp
musical ensemble.

Craftsmen will have items for sale throughout the afternoon.

"It's a chance to learn about parts of our culture that we're not exposed to very often,” said Lide. “We
expect it will be just good, old-time fun.”

For more information, call the College Union at 892-2140.
