Davidson students remain responsible

College students may not always be the most mature people around, but at least at Davidson, we are usually responsible
enough to know how to manage our own time. Last year’s discussion over whether or not to allow all students
access to cable in their dorm rooms brought to light a series of arguments suggesting that Davidson students could not
handle such a responsibility. Some administrators argued then, and a few continue to complain, that having cable TV in dorm
rooms is “too tempting” for students who are supposed to spend their time studying. Another complaint raised argued that cable
would keep students isolated in their rooms rather than being forced to socialize around the cable TVs provided in the
lounges.

But as The Davidsonian reports this week, a recent survey of Davidson students finds that the addition of cable has
not significantly changed the study habits of most students. In fact, the survey found that while students are watching slightly
more television, students are also studying more every week than they did last year before having access to cable in
every room. Furthermore, a lack of student lounges, which seemed to rarely hold large social gatherings even when they did
exist, would make it less likely, not more likely, that students would find themselves locked in solitary confinement in their
dorm rooms watching cable TV.

The recent election night event in which hundreds of students crowded into the 900 Room to both watch the election
results on CNN and to socialize is just one example of how students will not fail to come together in
public spaces just because they have cable TV in their rooms. College students are social by nature, and cable is
not going to change that.

Yet the recent election also demonstrates just how important it is to have easy access to cable TV. With network
news networks broadcasting a total of three hours of each the Democratic and Republican national conventions, where else could students
truly follow the news and the election? Some will surely argue that cable TV has brought more MTV than CNN
to students’ rooms, yet the fact remains that most of the fears about cable causing students to study less and
hide in their rooms have not occurred. And besides, aren’t we old enough to make our own decisions about how
and with whom we spend our time?

**Letters to the Editors**

**Bush must value fiscal responsibility**

Last week, Nathan Bradshaw wrote that moral values were not just about abortion and gays. And he’s right. Although it
may have looked like “moral values” are what won the election for George W. Bush, the numbers tell a different
story. Yes, more ballots were cast for Bush in states with a gay-marriage amendment on the ballot: 57.9 percent, versus
50.9 percent in states without an amendment. That’s a difference of 7 percent in terms of vote share. But Bush
won by 7.3 percent in the same states in 2000, which means that gay marriage, if anything, decreased the President’s
vote share. Clearly, moral values mean something more than gay marriage and abortion.

Values, Bradshaw says, should be defined in terms of “honesty, respect, and compassion.” To that, I would add responsibility. And
this week, President Bush and the Republican leadership in the House are not being responsible to the American people. Republicans
are expected to raise the debt $8 trillion because otherwise the United States would technically be bankrupt. This will be
the third time the Administration has requested a higher debt limit since 2002, and the Republican leadership will probably try
to do it discreetly, possibly by tagging it onto another bill—where’s the honesty in that?

Moral values can mean more than family values, they can mean valuing families—protecting working Americans from the spiraling debt, which,
like it or not, will have a serious effect on the economy if left unchecked. There is nothing “elitist” about
that. Would John Kerry do better? I don’t know, and frankly it does not matter; Bush is in office, and
he needs to start acting responsibly.

**‘Bike-cop’ should be commended**

Over the past few weeks it has been hard to ignore the growing amount of tension between students and public
safety.know campus police is often put in difficult situations, and for the most part take the correct course of action,
but occasionally they don’t. One example was PiKA Dawgs last Wednesday night when Sergeant Williams, known to most as “bike-cop,”
shut down the party too early without any apparent reason. Were students angry at the time? Absolutely. Still, what most
students probably don’t know is that the next day at dinner Sergeant Williams came to PiKA, said he was wrong,
and publicly apologized to all members of the house. He even went as far as to say that he lost
sleep over it that night. On behalf of PiKA, I would like to thank Sergeant Williams for his integrity. I
have been at Davidson for nearly three years now and even I have seen certain changes in the life on
the court. I agree some things should change over time, but integrity between students, campus police, and the administration shouldn’t
be one of them.

Liberals must learn to lean on the left
By ASHISH GEORGE
Guest Columnist

If there was any doubt that the Democratic Party was occupying the minority position, Nov. 2 ought to have erased
it. Despite going up against a president who was loathed with gusto on the left and performed miserably even by
the standards of traditional conservatism, the Democrats could not make their presentation palatable to enough Americans. After the compulsory drowning
of sorrows in alcohol and self-pity, liberals have posed the question: Where do we go from here? Well, first off,
how about back to liberalism?

Unfortunately, recent defeats have pushed the Democrats to the right. The only way to beat the Republicans, some maintain, is
to out-Republican them. Red America has derived much pleasure from thundering at liberals about how they need to stop being
condescending elitists and reconnect with “middle America.” This charge is dripping with insincerity. “Elitism,” that gratingly ubiquitous buzzword of the
aw-shucks conservative punditocracy, is a term that has lost all meaning because it is invoked so often as a smear
against liberals. Everything perceived as liberal is apparently by definition also elite. But it is hard to see how the
conservatives who level this accusation—you know, those my-heart-lies-on-the-prairie, Ivy League-educated, six-figure earning, urbanite George Will types—are somehow more in tune
with everyday America than their equally comfortably situated liberal counterparts.

It might be true that liberals nonetheless condescend to certain segments of the population that conservatives don’t, especially those who
tend to be more fervent in their religiosity. But what exactly is the problem with this? If someone holds an
irrational prejudice because of their religion, it is perfectly fair to call them out. Unlike race, sex, and other such
congenital accidents, a person’s religion is a voluntary enterprise; people choose to believe whatever they believe. It is generally neither
smart nor useful to mock someone for their religious views, but neither is it sensible to pretend that the prescriptions
of the Bible are by themselves a respectable source of one’s opinions on stem-cell research, homosexuality, and abortion. Divine command
does not an argument make.

The mistake John Kerry made was not a failure to try to appeal to people who view the world through
the lens of the Old Testament; no, John Kerry’s mistake was that he tried too hard to mollify this demographic.
In refusing to endorse gay marriage, Kerry made a move that was ethically inexcusable. These days it is polite to
say that we must compromise and concede on this or that matter. But the biggest problem of the American left
is precisely that—its platform is nothing less than abject capitulation on a whole host of issues. There is a truth
on the lips of honest liberals that is only uttered with great difficulty: Those who conflate the words of the
Bible with grounds for public policy simply do not deserve compromise. Liberalism cherishes tolerance, but tolerance is different from respect.
No Democrat should ever afford an anti-gay bias the same respect he or she would, say, disagreement over Social Security
or affirmative action. And that’s a form of condescension that’s worth any number of electoral defeats.
