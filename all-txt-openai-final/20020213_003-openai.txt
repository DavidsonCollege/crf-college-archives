I know that I can continue the work that the SGA has done so far and lead the SGA to new goals.”

Grady Paliersoln
Hometown: Columbia, SC. The same as Joey Harris
Major: Physics
SGA Experience: 3 years, SGA Vice President

Why are you running for this office?
“I have been involved with SGA since I came to Davidson. I have seen a lot of improvement in the system, but there are still some things that can be refined. Sometimes we get too involved with one or two things and neglect the range of topics that affect Davidson students. I’d like to make sure the office of President constantly looked at the big picture.”

Primary goals if elected SGA president:
- To improve on the system already in place.
- Improve communication on campus.
- Increase the amount of options students have to use their CatCard, both on and off campus.
- Make sure that a healthy relationship is maintained between PCC members, Campus Police, and the administration.
- Continue SGA support for athletics, continue student access to away basketball games and expand to all sports.
- Work closely with students and administration in giving students a place of their own, like the Outpost.

“Things are going real well, but we’re not there yet.”

Greatest accomplishments at Davidson:
- Got CatCard readers on library copiers and helped increase the readers on vending machines.
- Fought a SGA resolution last year to prevent Freshmen from parking wherever they wanted to on campus.
- Initiated and led a group of students into changing the way quiet hours on Patterson Court were interpreted.
- Petitioned to expand the Meal Plan allowance in the Union Cafe so that students could buy more or less food using their Meal Plan.
- Worked at getting a CatCard reader in a Domino’s delivery truck so that students can use their CatCard to order pizzas.### John
**Hometown:** Chattanooga, TN  
**Major:** Religion  
**SGA Experience:** I have yet to serve on SGA.

**Why are you running for this office?**
"My desire to serve my fellow students in this particular position arises from the time I spent away from Davidson in Spain. Weathering the events of this fall away from our college provided me with a far more profound sense of what Davidson is and what it can become. As I wrote to my friends here and asked them about our college’s response to all that had happened, they replied that there was a greater sense of community. This is a force in which I came to believe and for which I wish to work."

**Primary goals if elected SGA president:**
- Above all, to provide the student body with a greater sense of ownership in its SGA, through better accountability on the part of the officers and a drive to more equitably distribute the budget among the diverse groups that SGA supports.
- Unite student concern about academic policies, "Whether the GPA is 2.83 or 3.13, we are markedly disadvantaged in terms of competition with students from other comparable schools whose administration allows the GPA to ebb and flow. This business of 'urging the faculty to reflect upon their grading practices' is administrative tyranny, and we as students have a right to know how the academic bar is set."
- Foster a greater dialogue among the different religious groups on campus.
- Work toward a better social system, improving communication between the Union Board and PCC.

"My hopes and desires for Davidson cannot be condensed into some kind of catchphrase. I am running a campaign and pushing a vision that attempts to incorporate a broader representation of the Davidson community."

**Greatest accomplishments at Davidson:**
- Leadership in Weekly College Worship
- Service on the Davidson reverse-mission team to Nicaragua
- Support of the Education as Transformation Committee. These activities embody my commitment to the religious and spiritual vitality of the campus.
- Term as President of Sigma Phi Epsilon, during which the fraternity won the national governing body’s highest honor.

**If elected, what will be your primary goals?**
"Candidates for Davidson College SGA offices sometimes offer optimistic goals and promises in hopes of being elected. Instead, I will promise to do only what I have always done. Anytime the Davidson student body is being underrepresented, anytime there is a problem that faces the body as a whole, and anytime that there is a serious need for changes on campus, you can expect to find me prepared to work."

- Pay increases for RLO employees such as Hall Counselors and RAs.
