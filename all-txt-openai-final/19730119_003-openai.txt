**Honor Court Suspends Two Students**
HUGH MOORE

Honor violations during the fall examination period resulted in the suspension of two students. Declining to admit a violation, one
of the students presented his case in accordance with governance regulations to the Student Hearing Committee (SHC). He was convicted
of having previous knowledge of two of his final examinations. The defendant was suspended for a definite period of time
and will be permitted to re-enter Davidson without making an application again when that period has expired. "The committee also
recommended that his tuition be refunded," Clay said. According to Dean of Students Will Terry, the case will be appealed
to the Review Board.

In the second case, the charged student admitted the violation of dispensing information on a final examination before the examining
period was completed. Accordingly, he submitted to the imposition of sanctions in an administrative conference with Terry as outlined in
the governance regulations. This student was likewise suspended for a definite period of time and will also be allowed to
return to Davidson without making reapplication.

Although this examination period produced the first administrative conference since the beginning of the year and the first trial before
the SHC since this time last year, neither Terry nor Clay felt this reflected adversely on either the general principle
of self-scheduled examinations or on the new method of administering self-scheduled examinations. In previous self-scheduled examination periods, students were required
to produce a schedule indicating when they would take specific examinations and were also required to produce identification when they
picked up their examinations at Chambers Banquet Hall.

**Senate Tabulates Data On Relations**

The results of the Student Government Association (SGA) questionnaire on student-faculty relationships were tabulated Wednesday, with much of the data
inconclusive. SGA President Ralph Peeples expressed his dissatisfaction with the questionnaire results. "I can live with the results that we
did get, but the number of responses to the questionnaire was very disappointing," Peeples said. Only 508 of the 1100
questionnaires issued to students were returned. "It's impossible to interpret much of the data when you get less than half
the questionnaires back. We don't know anything about the 600 students who didn't respond," said Peeples.

Union Operations Manager Howard Ramagli, who tabulated the data and made a simple analysis of the results, expressed dissatisfaction with
the format of the questionnaire. "It's a poor questionnaire," he said. "Many of the questions were asked in a manner
which makes the responses virtually impossible to tabulate."

Of those students with a definite prospective major, 247 of 315 found professors' office hours sufficient, 281 of 311 found
professors 'receptive' or 'excited' when contacted, and only 34 of 304 felt that they were receiving less than 'adequate' personal
attention in their classroom work. However, when asked about social contacts with professors, 287 of 497 expressed dissatisfaction, only 10
of 494 felt that social contacts should be decreased, and 224 of 402 indicated that they had never been to
a professor's house socially, excluding their initial visit to their freshman advisor's home.

In addition, 392 of 502 students responding did not know that William Hight was director of counseling services. When asked
if enough time is spent with advisors before registration, 265 students felt that adequate time was spent while 219 felt
there was too little time spent and 9 felt too much time was spent with advisors.

Questionnaire responses also pointed to a severe lack of knowledge of the pre-law program at Davidson. Only 8 of 54
pre-law majors felt that pre-law advising was even 'adequate', 20 felt there was adequate information concerning graduate schools, and 17
pre-law majors felt their advisors had 'adequate' familiarity with graduate schools to which they were most likely to apply.

"I want to see Hight, Proctor, and Bevan and then write up a report—a salvage operation," said Peeples when asked
what action the SGA would take as a result of the questionnaire.

**Peace Coalition Attends Rally**

The Davidson Peace Coalition will attend the national anti-war demonstration tomorrow morning in Washington. It was explained at a meeting
Monday night that the National Peace Action Coalition had secured a permit to march from the Lincoln Memorial to the
Washington Monument where a rally will be held. The March Against Death is intended to be a silent public expression
of the grief and frustration towards the war. It was agreed by all who attended the meeting that only quiet,
peaceful mourning will be effective in calling attention to a tired nation.

Housing arrangements have been made with the Church of the Pilgrim near Georgetown University. The pastor of this church is
the father of Mark Meza who graduated from Davidson last year. It was tentatively decided that all planning to go
should meet at the Union early this afternoon. The Coalition will return Sunday morning.examinations, however, both of these requirements were
eliminated due to action taken by the Educational Policy Committee (EPC). Terry said that this new method had no bearing
on the case which came before him. Clay suggested as a safeguard that once again students should be required to
produce identification when picking up their examinations. He did not, though, advocate a return to prior scheduling. Clay did say
that he felt the same about the honor system now as he did before the examination violations. "I was particularly
encouraged that it was students who turned in the violators," he said. Terry went one step further, saying that he
had never seen students so concerned about the system. The Dean, however, felt strongly that some faculty members were doing
harm to the honor system by not allowing their students to self-schedule their examinations simply because “they did not trust
them.” Clay agreed, “It infuriates me," he said. "For their mistrust, they implicitly feel the honor system is worthless and
they are wrong."

Murray Delivers Two Lectures On Media In Reynolds Series
By VAL VAN HORN
Staff Writer

J. Edward Murray, president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, editor of Knight Newspaper Wire, and associate editor of
“The Detroit Free Press,” lectured at Hodson Hall this week on “Threats to Free Press in the Communications Era” and
“Morality and the Media in Mao's China.”

“We are moving rapidly from the industrial era, in which technology and military power have dominated,” said Murray, “into the
communications era, in which the dominant factor will be the continuing explosion of knowledge.” Murray looks at the media as
the means of communication that are used by men to transmit messages to other men. Some of the more sophisticated
media mentioned by Murray include information transmission by laser beam, computerized information storage and retrieval, cable television, and communications satellites.

Satellites are one example of the free media threatened by censorship. Last August, Andrei A. Gromyko, foreign minister of the
Soviet Union, proposed strict censorship of satellite communication by individual nations, Murray said. Technology is being developed so that ground
transmitters, now necessary for TV satellite signals, can be bypassed with signals sent directly into the receivers’ televisions. This would
allow viewers to receive uncensored television from another nation. To prevent this, Gromyko proposed an international law which would allow
each government to have the right to screen satellite TV by controlling all broadcasts at their source. If necessary, the
satellites could be destroyed by force to prevent unwanted broadcasts, Murray said. A vote was taken at the United Nations
General Assembly to begin drafting a world treaty based on Gromyko's proposal. Only the U.S. dissented.

“While the U.S. ambassador defends the principle of global free press, the performance of the Nixon administration cannot be very
convincing to other nations," Murray said. He referred to Vice President Agnew's anti-press speeches in 1969, as well as Mr.
Nixon's more subtle tactics of communicating less in public press conferences but more with prime time TV addresses as well
as his private interviews with favorable single journalists.

Another threat to free press in the United States is the Supreme Court's Caldwell decision, or the decision that newsmen
have no legal right to protect their confidential sources from grand juries. Because of this, three newsmen have been jailed,
others threatened with jail, and the American public is deprived of the information supplied by confidential sources, Murray said. Although
the Gallup Poll revealed that the public believes newsmen should not be required to reveal confidential sources, Murray feels that
it is doubtful this public view will rally behind shield laws for newsmen. It is this apathy concerning free press
by citizens which is one of the biggest threats, Murray said. It is taken so much for granted that people
will not be aware that it is being taken over, as that of Mao's China already has been.

“My main impression of China," said Murray, “is that there is a new moral tone in the country, a strong
new morality. Everything is clean. Almost no crime. No exploitation of sex.” Murray thinks that one answer for this change
in China is lack of personal, political, and intellectual freedom. “Lack of personal freedom is literally destructive of morality. A
man who is compelled to act morally, as in China, by pressure from the government, from his peers, and from
the media, is not fully moral in the best sense," said Murray. “The great propaganda pressure for conformity to a
Maoist line in personal political life constitutes a harsh curtailment of freedom. This cripples what I have called the new
morality in China,” he said.

Murray came to Davidson under the Reynolds Lecture Series.
