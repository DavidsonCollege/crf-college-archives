### Wildcats Win Two Gold Medals at Belk Invitational

**Wildcats set 15 meet records, Gibson and Bitter record wins**

Junior Dan Gibson set a new school record and led a strong group of performers as the Davidson track teams
hosted the second annual Irwin Belk Invitational Saturday afternoon on the Davidson campus.

The Davidson men picked up two first-place finishes during the one-day event. Gibson took home top honors in the 1500
meters in a time of 3:50.99. That time shattered the school record of 3:53.80, which Gibson set on St. Patrick’s
Day at the 49er Classic in Charlotte, N.C. Also tallying a first place on the afternoon was sophomore Graham Watson
(Richmond, Va.). Watson tossed the javelin a meet-record 50.00 meters.

In addition, the Wildcat men posted four top-five performances at the meet. Sophomore Greg Schernecke (Philadelphia, Pa.) finished fifth in
the 100 meters (:11.17) and added a third-place finish in the 400 hurdles (:56.34). Freshman Andrew Pratt (Basking Ridge, N.J.)
ran the 200 in :22.17 for a second-place finish while the 4x400 meter relay team finished fourth with a time
of 3:25.55. Senior Smyth Bitter was the lone woman to notch a win, finishing first in the 800 with a
time of 2:20.32. Two women took home top-five finishes this afternoon. Sophomore Liz Gross (Chesterland, Ohio) finished third in the
800 (2:24.08). Junior Megan O’Neill (Charlotte, N.C.) finished fifth in the shot put with a throw of 10.74m. The 4x100
women’s team finished third with a time of :51.74 while the 4x400 team was third in a time of 4:09.14.
There were a total of seven meet records set on the men’s side while the women combined to break a
total of eight meet marks.

### Gibson’s Best is Yet to Come

By Jenn Higgins
Staff Writer

Dan Gibson is a runner who seemingly knows no bounds. Since arriving at Davidson in the fall of 1998, the
Wooster, Ohio, native has consistently outpaced his competition from the cross-country trails to the track.

As co-captain of the men’s cross-country team and a recognized leader in Davidson’s track and field program, Gibson seems to
have his sights set on building a place in the record books. Case in point: His dominance in the 1,500-meter
competition in recent seasons.

“Dating back to last year, he has broken the school record in each of his last four 1,500-meter races,” said
head coach Gary Andrew.

Last weekend in the second annual Irwin Belk Invitational, Gibson shattered his school record by almost three seconds (3:50.99) in
a bittersweet victory over the same two runners who had beaten him the previous weekend at UNC-Charlotte’s 49er Classic.

With this constant improvement, the junior is on pace to represent the school at the national level. Andrew says that
Gibson is now “about six seconds away from provisionally qualifying for the NCAA championships” in the 1,500-meter event.

A talented runner all his life, Gibson has compensated for his weaknesses and grown tremendously as an athlete over the
past two years. Andrew describes his success as a “confidence booster” and “a contributing factor in improving his mental toughness.”

“He is a team leader who elevates the competitiveness of the team and inspires others to achieve more,” says Andrew.
“I can say with conviction that his best is yet to come.”
