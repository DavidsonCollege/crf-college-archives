DAVIDSON SPLITS SERIES (Continued from page 1)

pitchers’ battle between Worth and Pegram, neither side being able to score. Withers replaced Worth in the sixth, and pitched good ball for the next three innings, striking out five men and walking but one. However, the Davidson infield went up in the seventh inning, and this fact, coupled with the four hits garnered by Oak Ridge off Withers, gave the visitors seven runs and the game. Garrison went in the box for Davidson in the last inning, and showed up well. One of the chief reasons for Oak Ridge’s victory was the pitching of Pegram. He struck out 13 men and only walked two. Mayberry also played a good game for Oak Ridge, getting four hits and scoring one run.

MILITARY COMPANY AND RIFLE CLUB GROWING.

The military company at Davidson is no longer a project but an assured organization. When the call went forth on last Monday night, “all out for the military company,” more than thirty students responded. No definite organization was gone into then, but the officers will probably be elected at the first meeting next week. It was decided that the company meet three times each week on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday nights in the Gymnasium. Increased interest is manifested at every drill. Starting with only a few, the number has steadily enlarged until now nearly one hundred students are enrolled. Those that have had previous training in military schools are directing the drill. Much of the success and interest in the drill thus far has been due to the leadership and help of B. D. Reddey, W. D. Lawson, and “Bob” Walker.

NEW BOOKS IN LIBRARY.

To the lovers of books of travel and books on health, the Library is now a genuine mecca. Several books on each of these subjects have been purchased recently and added to the collections on these subjects. Among the books of travel and adventure are: “Texas, The Marvelous,” by Nevin Q. Winter; “Tramping Through Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras,” by Harry A. Franck; and “Winter Journeys in the South,” by John Martin Hammond. Among the recently acquired “Health” books the following are worthy of mention: “Laymen’s Handbook of Medicine,” by Cabot; “Personal Hygiene,” by Pyle; and “Keeping Physically Fit,” by William J. Cromie.

SUNDAY SCHOOL PROBLEMS DISCUSSED BY LEADERS

During the past week the teachers and officers of the Sunday School of the Presbyterian Church gathered at the home of Mr. C. L. Grey and discussed the problems of the Sunday School. Rev. W. C. Wauchope, of Cornelius, was an invited guest for the occasion and spoke on Sunday School work. After Mr. Wauchope's talk, Miss Withers and Miss Shaw gave interesting talks, and then the time was spent as a social gathering. Mr. F. L. Jackson presided over the meeting, which was very profitable.

BLUE PENCIL CLUB ELECTS NEW MEMBERS

At a meeting of the Blue Pencil Club last Monday night the following men were initiated as members: Chambliss, W. C. Cumming, and H. T. Lilly. In the local contest, L. A. Chambliss won with his story “It.” This is to be sent in for the National Fiction Contest of the Sigma Upsilon.
