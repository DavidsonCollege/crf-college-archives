**Town Day held last Saturday**

On May 3, the town of Davidson and Davidson College sponsored their annual Town Day. According to Vicki Rogers, community liaison for the YSSC, the Y worked with Pat Johnson, the Director of the Community Center, in organizing the event. Rogers emphasized that there was no budget set aside for Town Day; funds came from both town and college donations. The activities were primarily for community children and included a bike parade, a “fishing” booth, face painting, water gun and candles, and a sponge toss. There was free ice cream for everyone. A bluegrass band composed of junior Jay Wilkins, and freshmen Molly Cochran, Valerie Graves, and Liza Paschale performed to an enthusiastic audience. Rogers was impressed by the amount of support from Patterson Court, particularly since it was Beach Weekend. Churches, stores, senior citizens, volunteers, and community leaders from the town worked in conjunction with the students. Rogers says the YSSC is pleased with this year’s turnout, the largest in several years, and adds that while both the campus and community wish Town Day to remain a small community affair, she hopes that next year will bring even more student involvement.

Material contributed by Hunter Roddey

The Senior Class Gift Executive Committee changed the Summer Abroad Scholarship’s official name to the Class of 1986 Summer Abroad Scholarship in Memory of Tim Wen. The composition of the scholarship itself was not altered. Not only the seniors contribute to the gift, but now the faculty will also have the opportunity to contribute if they wish. The seniors and the faculty wish to honor and remember Wen in this way. So far, 65% of the senior class has donated to the gift, but not all pledge cards have been received. About 70 pledge cards are still outstanding. The Alumni Office reminds seniors to fill out information cards if they did not do so at the Senior Banquet. Come by the Alumni Office, Chambers 120, and fill one out before May 14.

**New vice president for academic affairs named**

By ANDREA GROSS

Robert C. Williams, dean of University College at Washington University in St. Louis, has been named vice president for academic affairs and dean of faculty at Davidson. President Kuykendall announced the appointment Friday, May 2. Williams, a former Pulitzer Prize nominee, will assume the post effective August 1. Williams replaces T.C. Price Zimmermann, who held the position for nine years. After a sabbatical year, Zimmermann will return to Davidson and assume the position of Charles A. Dana Professor of History. “Bob Williams is a worthy successor to this vital position in the life of the college,” Kuykendall said. “He has the background, temperament, and energy to do an outstanding job.”

Williams has been dean of University College since 1981. His service there included the directorship of the evening college for part-time adult students, and co-directorship of Washington's Program in Technology and the Liberal Arts, sponsored by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. He is also a professor of history, specializing in Russian and Soviet history. “Coming to Davidson is a reaffirmation of faith in the liberal arts,” Williams said. “I’m tremendously excited about the possibility of coming. The task is going to be building on the past, building on Davidson's Presbyterian Southern traditions, and reaching for national recognition as one of America’s top liberal arts colleges.”

Harvard University Press nominated Williams for the Pulitzer Prize in 1981 for his book "Russian Art and American Money: 1900-1940." In addition to his position of associate professor and professor of history at Washington, he served previously as a lecturer and assistant professor at Williams College. He holds a doctorate in history and a master’s degree in Russian studies from Harvard and a bachelor’s degree in mathematics and physics from Wesleyan University. The author of several books on Russian history, art history, and the history of nuclear energy, Williams will have two new books published during the upcoming academic year: "The Other Bol-"

**Morris outlines athletic department's future**

By MIKE HOBBS

On Tuesday in the Big Screen Room, Davidson Athletic Director Christopher Morris talked about the future of Davidson's athletic program. Morris explained that when he came to Davidson 16 months ago, he formulated a list of objectives for the athletic program. Giving equal weight to each point, they were: 1) Find an appropriate league for the football...team, and support the team so that they would be competitive in that league. 2) Find a suitable conference for men’s basketball and Davidson's other varsity sports. 3) Place women’s sports in a league and give them adequate support so that they too would be competitive. 4) Build the new sports complex. 5) Create a definite administrative structure in the Athletic Department. 6) Create a consensus among campus groups that Davidson athletics was in line with the institutional objectives of the school.

During his brief tenure, Morris has achieved his first goal, football having found a home in the Colonial League. While the team will be eligible for the Southern Conference championship next year, the primary scheduling emphasis will be placed on Colonial League opponents. The league is composed of schools with profiles similar to Davidson’s — small, academically recognized liberal arts colleges, with a firm commitment to the scholar-athlete. The switch from the Southern Conference was prompted by a realization that Davidson football would not ever be able to compete with schools that offer athletic scholarships. This feeling is substantiated by Davidson's record in the conference over the last fifty years, where they have won only 26 percent of their games. If Davidson were to offer enough scholarships to make a difference in the program, Morris estimates that it would cost the school nearly $500,000, which does not include the cost of an equal number of NCAA-required scholarships for women. Just on the basis of the cost of tuition, a school like Western Carolina can offer three scholarships for the same price as one by Davidson. Morris explained, “I would rather spend the money where we are on an equal footing with those schools. Coaches, equipment, recruiting, and travel cost the same for all of us and would provide greater results per dollar spent.”

The future of the other men’s varsity programs is not as definite. The Cats will remain in the Southern Conference for the next year and be eligible for Southern Conference titles, but after that, the picture will remain blurry until a conference task force on the Davidson question finishes its report late this summer. Morris believes that the task force is sympathetic to our cause since it is composed primarily of members who have supported Davidson in the past. If the group does vote to exclude Davidson from the Southern Conference, then the Wildcats will seek affiliation with another conference, most likely the Colonial Athletic Association. Morris asserts that Davidson would definitely join another conference as soon as possible, but he is leaving all options open and is hopeful that no change will be necessary.

Next year all of Davidson’s women’s varsity teams will compete in Division I, which was a change mandated by the NCAA. Teams will be fielded in cross-country, field hockey, indoor track, outdoor track, and tennis along with the new addition of volleyball and golf. The NCAA requires that a school offer a proportional number of men and women’s teams, and that these teams compete in the same division. Until this year Davidson’s men’s program was allowed to remain in Division I, while the women’s teams were free to compete in Division III. Morris pledged the support and resources of the entire athletic department to help ease the transition process and make the teams competitive on the new level. Davidson is the smallest school to compete on the Division I level, and Morris is aware of the difficulties that this presents. When questioned whether this decision was wise Morris replied, “Ambitious, yes. Insane, . . . ask me in five years.” Yet he points to the success of the soccer, basketball, tennis, and baseball teams as proof that we can not only compete but excel in football and women’s sports.
