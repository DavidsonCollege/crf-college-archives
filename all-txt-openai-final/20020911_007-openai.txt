On and our school have changed in so many ways. Share your thoughts and memories in the space below. How
can we better serve our world?

However united we stood after September 11, support for disrupting terrorist networks and preventing attacks on American citizens has lately
fallen prey to concerns about misguided bombings, detainee privileges, plans for regime change in Iraq, and even questions of our
moral mandate in a world of moral relativism. While many have been quick to reprimand the US for its behavior
and rhetoric, far fewer have praised the serendipity of the debate itself. Are these opposing views confined to the basements
of renegade dissidents? No, they appear on the pages of The New York Times and The Washington Post, written by
the likes of James Baker, Brent Scowcroft, and John Kerry.

The truth is that the US is fortuitously experiencing an onslaught of free thinking and Socratic questioning, the very tools
which in a democracy help build and shape public policy. That the US is subject to these pressures makes it
like few other nations on earth. Try to vent an unpopular view in a paper in Egypt, Pakistan, or especially
Iraq, and see how quickly it gets published. President Bush and his administration have conducted the War on Terrorism in
such a responsible and effective manner, due partly to the transparency and accountability that a free press and diverse population
demands. He is continually vulnerable to the feelings of the US populace, directed through representatives in Congress and the right
to free speech, and to the feelings of other nations, directed through diplomatic channels. Due to this, President Bush will
not only approach Congress before taking any action towards Iraq (which he may do after sending troops, according to the
War Powers Act of 1973), but also approach the world, via the UN summit this week. Clearly, the strength of
our democracy lies not in the voices of those who support the War on Terrorism, but in that we can
hear the voices of those who do not.

Asked for a political scientist’s perspective on 9/11, I am humbled to offer only a few thoughts about an event
so momentous that it will long shape how we regard/rewrite our politics, our history, our morality, and our religious tolerances.
The task of reflection here is daunting, so I take refuge in looking more to the political than the personal.
Images such as those of average Americans and executives alike losing their lives, and the pain in the faces of
family and friends devastated by grief and disbelief will not fade—no matter the size, the shape, or the locale of
any memorials. Never forgetting these images nor the less heralded horrendous beauty of a nation so diverse at least momentarily
unified by fear and sorrow, we should ask ourselves what this portends for the long-term interests of our nation and
our humanity. Should patriotism not allow for dissent? Should national grief overshadow the need for deliberation and debate in the
design of an omnibus homeland security response? One of the best things I did for myself during the past year
was to read a travel book written about Afghanistan before 9/11.

- Ricardo Ampudia ’04With eloquence and no agenda aforethought, Jason Elliot’s *An Unexpected Light* describes a land and a people
with a history that defies our American imagination and a country already so decimated by civil war. To reach toward
solutions, should we not excavate some of the potential causes of the attack? Was it an attack stemming from an
ambiguous evil that haunts human nature? Was it ignited by an American arrogance born of energy and excess? To what
extent did our American idealism, one where our reach often exceeds our grasp, infuriate those who view the world differently?
There are no easy answers; there are only newer and more nuanced questions about national security, civil liberties, political leadership,
and belief systems.

**Ground Zero**

What will be built at the World Trade Center site? At this point, the proposals submitted to the group in
charge of the redevelopment have been undistinguished and uninteresting. Fortunately, all hope is not lost.

This past summer, I worked for the architecture firm Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, which is involved in the redevelopment of
the site. While there, I had the opportunity to see designs for a proposed building that would truly be a
fitting memorial: A 70-story office tower sheathed in an exterior skeleton that would rise an additional 40 stories above the
building’s top floors, creating a skyline element not unlike that of the Eiffel Tower.

The building would become more transparent and open up as it rose, as if it were disappearing into the sky,
creating a void as powerful as the structure itself. Believe me, words do not do justice to this design.

I can only hope that an inspiring design such as this will rise out from the collection of mediocrity currently
being proposed. By building a truly world-class structure, we will pay tribute to those who lost their lives and show
the strength and ingenuity of America.

**The world is bigger than Davidson**

I define a sheltered person as someone who ignores the real world and instead focuses on the events occurring within
their own “more important” little world. A sheltered person can never garner my respect. And on Sept. 11, 2001, I
learned that my history professor was sheltered.

That Tuesday was to be the day of that generic library tour/spiel that we’ve all heard 31 times and are
going to hear another 25 before we graduate. As I entered the library, I noticed a gathering around a TV
in the lobby area. I’m not even going to attempt to describe my feelings the moment I realized what was
happening. I just stood there, mouth open, for about 10 minutes, saying nothing and absorbing all I saw. Then to
my right, I hear, “Well people, I know this is tragic, but we really need to get this done. I
mean, if you need to make phone calls or whatever, go ahead, but I think it’s time to get started.”
I turned, mouth open, disbelieving. Again. It’s hard to say that after witnessing those events I could be surprised further
that day, but I was. And so we filed into the computer room at the center of the library and
learned about how to do research at the library.

I sat there and merely watched the faces of those who stood silent vigil over the TV, watching history unfold
as I, ironically, sat in history class. By the time class had ended, both towers, which were standing when it
had begun, were gone. But what America had lost in human lives and innocence, I had gained (re-gained) in the
knowledge of doing research at the library. And that’s all that matters. Right?
