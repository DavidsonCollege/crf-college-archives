Patience, Turnovers Hurt Wildcats In Two Losses

By STEVE BYERS and SCOTT HUIE

The Cats spurted to a quick 14-4 lead Tuesday against Southern Conference foe East Tennessee. But the Buccaneers proved that they were not the second coming of Erskine as they methodically erased the lead and glided to a 58-51 victory.

“After that quick lead,” sophomore center Jim McConkey said, “we should have been a little more patient and played ball control offense, instead of throwing up shots the first chance we got.”

Davidson was led by KW (for outsiders, that’s senior Kenny Wilson), who banked in 21 points before fouling out. Pepper Bego contributed 14 points, and Gerry Born snatched 10 rebounds. The loss showed that no game from now on can be tucked away as a sure victory. VMI, the perennial cellar dweller of the Southern Conference, knocked off the very same East Tennessee in their previous meeting. With nothing but a rugged conference schedule left and a showdown at Notre Dame, each win the Cats can muster should be cherished.

Furman

Turnovers and Gerry Born. Too many of the former and not enough of the latter. That was essentially the story of Davidson's 57-48 loss to Furman Saturday night at Johnston Gym. Born, who led the team in scoring with 17 points and rebounding with seven, could not have played much better. Unfortunately, none of the other Wildcats came close to matching Born’s output.

The loss, which dropped the Cats to 1-2 in the Southern Conference and 5-8 overall, allowed Furman to avenge a defeat at the hands of Davidson at Furman just 10 days before. The two big guns in this game, the Paladins’ George Singleton and Davidson’s Kenny Wilson, were effectively bottled up by the defenses, as Singleton tallied only nine points in 38 minutes, while Wilson fouled out with 5:30 to go with only 10 points. Wilson’s neutralization obviously hurt the Cats more.

Furman did its damage in the backcourt, as freshman Shawn Reid and senior Floyd Creed combined for 32 points and played consistently good defense throughout. On the other side, Davidson’s duo of freshman Cary! Dawson and sophomore Pepper Bego, though they did have their moments, scored a total of only 12 points and committed some costly turnovers down the stretch.

Super Sunday is drawing nigh, and with the game, we thought you'd like to get an idea of what our learned faculty and staff think. The verdict is overwhelmingly in the Redskins’ favor. But Coach John Byrd, widely considered the Lyle Alzado of equipment managers, warns, “The Raiders can stop the Redskins more times than the Redskins can stop the Raiders.” Byrd, however, is nearly alone in that opinion. Randy Nelson, the lone faculty member to pick the World Series correctly, says the Skins are the team to beat. (Anyone willing to lose money can call him.) Cindy Lewis, who thinks the Raiders sound “sinister,” picks the Redskins as well. Gil Aand, a Skins fan since the days of “Bullet Bill Dudley,” will choose Washington “only if they put the teepee back.”Picks:

The world when the crowd at Johnston Gym gets behind the Cats early and remains vocal, putting pressure on the opponent. But Davidson could muster only four points after nine minutes of the first half while Furman continued to expand its lead, which took the crowd right out of the game. Other than a great spinning layup by Wilson and dominating offensive play by Born, the first half belonged to Furman as the Cats trailed by 10 after 20 minutes.

The second half was more of the same, as Born continued to shine, and the Furman guards hit jumper after jumper. Davidson began to make up some ground as the crowd was obviously starting to rattle Furman, but then two important events squelched the Cat’s rally. Wilson fouled out on a very suspect call, and after that the Cats lost their poise, turning over the ball time after time on key possessions, letting the Paladins regain some confidence and close out the game with excellent ball handling.

Now excuses could be made — the officiating was worse than in an IMAC game, or Davidson was just too inexperienced to handle Furman that night — but the bottom line is consistency, and the Wildcats simply do not have it yet. How else can you explain victories over Furman and South Carolina followed by uninspired performances against UNCC and the same Furman team?

This game showed just how vital Wilson is to this young team and just how equally vital it is that the whole team support Wilson or pick up the slack on an off night. Saturday night Born responded with a gallant effort, but now he knows what Wilson has been going through — there are no one-man teams that win consistently.

Women’s Basketball

The women’s basketball team continued its uphill struggle last week as their record slipped to 0-11. 

Monday the team faced Lenayr, playing fairly well despite losing. Tuesday afternoon UNC-A won handily at Davidson, 103-26. Last night the Lady Cats dropped to a powerful Mars Hill team, 99-31. Senior Nancy Bondurant was high scorer with nine points.

Athlete Of The Week

This week’s Athlete of the Week is Gerry Born, chosen for his improved, aggressive inside play this week. He led the team in scoring against Furman with 17 points, a personal season high. Monday Born, a sophomore forward, led the team with 10 rebounds in a narrow loss to East Tennessee State.
