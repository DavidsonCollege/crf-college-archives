**Cats Wonder**

By CHARLES KENNON
Asst. Managing Editor

Waiting in the stands in Johnston gym for the advent of...

Who knows Louie Mills stories? Whispered on the wind, the rumors fly. Wednesday is Louie Mills night. Did he or
did he not flip the bird to the crowd? Did he or did he not say to the Wildcat on
first shaking hands, "Eat shit, Bender"? No one knows for sure. So the night of the Richmond game (Yes, Virginia,
there is a Richmond), I wait to see the legend.

In he walks to a standing ovation from the Davidson crowd. Majestic? Hardly. Noticeable? Not particularly. Wrathful? He had a
pontifical smile on. Bald? Well, yes, but that doesn't mean much. Taking my courage in both hands, I approach the
legend, tap him on the shoulder, and ask for an interview.

"Could I talk to you after the game for THE DAVIDSONIAN, Coach Mills?"

"Certainly, dear," said the legend.

Hmmm. A legend who calls me 'dear'. This enigma calls out for further investigation. All through the game, I kept
tabs on Louie’s reactions. One technical was called on the Richmond bench in each half. The second 'T' came after
an Academy Award-winning performance and a trip the length of the court with all the dramatic stalking of Richard Burton
playing "Hamlet". In response to the catcalls and applause from the Davidson gentlepersons (reminded of their manners prior to the
game), Louie only smiled.

After the game, I waited for Louie outside the locker room. I was a little nervous. After all, Louie is
a legend. He has a famous temper. He might punch me out. He came out.

"Hello dear," said the legend.

From there the interview went downhill. Louie beamed. He enjoys the response he gets from Davidson students. I asked him
if he played up his reactions to bad calls to solicit crowd reaction. Did he punch me out? No. He
told me that he would never do anything to hurt his team. I told him he was a figment of
Davidson’s imagination. Did he get mad? No. He laughed.

"That’s probably true," he said. He said he doesn’t particularly enjoy coming to Davidson because his team loses a lot
here. He said that Davidson students give him the best audience/reception of any group Richmond plays. Louie said, "You have
a good ball team." He patted me.

**Irish Rally To Preserve Win As Cats Refuse To Lie Down**

Someone who watched Notre Dame play last Saturday against Davidson could ask how did that team beat U.C.L.A.? For the
first few minutes of the first half, Davidson took a 12-7 lead despite shooting poorly. However, later in the half,
the Irish ran a string of 10 unanswered points together to take command. The teams went into the locker rooms
with Notre Dame up 13, 45-32. Balanced scoring by Notre Dame was led by Gary Brokaw and John Shumate. The
other Irish star, Adrian Dantley, did not play after...

was fitting to see the biggest hot dog in college sports, John Shumate, go to the line and increase the
margin of victory from a measly nine to double figures. John Shumate, who had never impressed me as the ketchup
and mustard type before the game, really showed it in this game. After being knocked down while driving down the
lane, the Shu sat on the court for at least one minute just pulling up his socks. When he stood
back up, he received a good ovation from the otherwise quiet crowd and started laughing. Gary Novak (avg. 5.7 ppg)
and Dwight Clay (8.7 ppg) had 17 and 19 points respectively. Clay, who is shooting just under 42 percent on
the year, was 9-13 and had six in the second half. Novak was seven for eight from the field.

For the Cats, this game marked the return of John Falconi, who had missed the last seven games. He saw
spot-duty action and had six points. T. J. Pecorak had his best half of basketball in a while. In the
second half, T.J. was six for six and had four rebounds to score his game total of twelve points. The
leading scorers in the game were Brokaw and Shumate, who had 24 and 26 points respectively. The Cats were led
by Larry Horowitz, who started slowly but ended with 18 points. Davidson had four men in double figures despite the
loss; they were Dunn with 16, and Powell, Sheldon Parker, and Pecorak with 12 each. Davidson had more field goals
and more Catholics than did Notre Dame, but neither of these factors seemed to help. The Praying Irish were 21-32
from the line, while the Cats could manage only ten attempts from the charity stripe, making eight.
