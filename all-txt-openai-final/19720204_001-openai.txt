1972 (Staff photo by Campbell) A LONG TIME COMING Spencer discusses the revised comprehensive fee plan. Comprehensive Fee Revised By
Bevan-Cornell Decision By BILL GIDUZ Asst. Managing Editor In a statement issued Tuesday morning, College President Samuel R. Spencer Jr.
announced that vice presidents John M. Bevan and C. David Cornell reviewed the comprehensive fee and recommended that the board
portion of the fee be revised. Spencer stated that he approves of the recommendations and they will be implemented starting
with the next school year. The revised plan states that the principle of the fee will remain, but its implementation
will be changed so that, “Upperclass students will be given the option of boarding at the center on Patterson Court,
at the fraternity houses on campus, or they may make individual arrangements to eat elsewhere.” Mechanics for making the choice
will be as follows: on the first billing for the year, mailed on or about Aug. 1, students and/or parents
will have an opportunity to check a space indicating “Do not wish college board for the year.” The charge for
board will be deducted for all who check and return the statement by Sept. 1. All students eating in fraternities
will handle their arrangements with each fraternity both for board and for any additional fees. Freshmen will still be required
to eat at the three ARA houses: the old Phi Gam house, the old SPE house, and another house to
be decided on soon. The revised fee allows for refunds in cases where a student leaves the campus for one
term or more to pursue academic work. Off-campus housing and special requests to be excluded from any specific portion of
the fee will be individually considered by Dean of Students Will Terry, the statement said. The compulsive board section of
the fee had been under attack by students since its conception, but reactions to the alteration of board payment were
favorable. Former Student Body President Danny Clodfelter, who initiated the battle against the fee, commented, “It shows what can be
done if you keep up the pressure and are persistent.”

Faculty Favors Review Of Calendar By THOM NICOLL Asst. Managing Editor Results of a recent survey of the faculty reveal
that a significant number favor a review of Davidson's present 3-3-3 calendar, according to John M. Bevan, vice president for
academic affairs. Of the approximately 100 forms sent out, 53 were returned. Thirty of the forms returned were favorable to
a review of the 3-3-3 system. Of the remaining group, 20 claimed to be relatively satisfied with the present calendar,
while three indicated that they would be equally happy under any system. Sixteen of those who favored a review claimed
that a system based on the semester would be preferable, while 17 expressed interest in either a 4-1-4 calendar or,
perhaps a 4-0-4 system, under which a student would work during the missing middle month only if he made special
arrangements with a professor. One common complaint about the 3-3-3 calendar was that it limited the extended studies program. This
argument is that while a professor is teaching regular courses, he tends to regard extended studies as something “extra” and
of low priority. About 14 percent of the replies indicated that the 10-week term does not provide adequate time for
students to grasp the ideas of a course. Others argued that 10 weeks were not adequate for students to conduct
certain scientific research experiments. Several who approved the proposed review claimed that Davidson’s calendar should be more compatible with those
of the schools who share cooperative programs with Davidson. Of those who opposed a review of the calendar, 10 simply
felt that the 3-3-3 was adequate and eight stated that the calendar has not been tried long enough to make
a judgment. Others claimed that the 10-week term was ideal for certain programs, such as the Spring Term in Classics
Abroad. Even of those who favored no review of the basic structure of the calendar, several wished to review the
timing of the winter break. Of the 53 replies, 12 indicated dissatisfaction with the present timing of the Christmas vacation.
Bevan said he will take the results of this survey to the Educational Policy Committee which will investigate the present
calendar as well as alternatives. They will then report to the faculty. Student Body President Ralph Peeples said he welcomes
discussion on the calendar issue. “I think it is important that we evaluate present practices from time to time in
order to determine whether they are most beneficial to the college,” he said.really interested in getting something done. It's a
victory for the students in that they (the administration) were forced to go back and reconsider and change a decision
that they had already made. That's the important point."

Ralph Peeples, present Student Body President, praised the administration for the move. "It shows a willingness on the part of
the administration to listen to the students on matters about which they are truly concerned,” he said. “It is a
compromise and a good one. It's the best indication that I've had since I've been at Davidson that progress can
be made without confrontation."

Students must decide whether to join the ARA plan by Sept. 1, as no meal tickets will be issued after
that date. However, ARA houses will serve food to any student on a cash basis at any time.

### YMCA Attempts To Meet Challenges

**AN ANALYSIS By DOUG BROWN Managing Editor**

The Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA), an organization which has always seemed an integral part of Davidson, is in a
period of transition. With the departure of College Chaplain R. Scott Woodmansee in December, the YMCA is presently without an
advisor, and it has had to rely on the initiative of its student leadership. Another factor which will have a
considerable influence on the future of the YMCA is its planned relocation off campus this coming fall.

The only contact most students have with the YMCA is through its annual fund drive when they are asked to
donate money. Seemingly, most are unaware of what the YMCA is or what it does. YMCA programs now involve such
varied fields as the tutoring of underprivileged children, scouting, hall discussions, symposiums on great issues, draft counseling, and other activities.
However, most of these programs go unnoticed, and as one member of the YMCA Cabinet put it at a recent
meeting, "I didn’t even know what the YMCA was or did until I became a member of the Cabinet."

Of immediate concern to the members of the YMCA Cabinet, the governing body of the YMCA, is the problem of
getting a new college chaplain. Woodmansee, before leaving Davidson, left three recommendations about the future of the chaplaincy at Davidson.
One of the recommendations Woodmansee made was that the chaplain could serve as college chaplain and as associate minister at
the Davidson College Presbyterian Church. Another proposal was that the chaplain could become a member of the faculty, in addition
to his other duties. The final recommendation was that the position of chaplain remain essentially as it is now.

Student Body President Ralph Peeples, a member of the YMCA Cabinet, sees no need for a college chaplain. In his
view, the chaplain’s function as a student counselor has been co-opted by the two clinical psychologists available for this function.
Peeples remarked, "This college had better start setting priorities. Would the chaplain's salary be better used to help hire a
clinical psychologist? Is it more important that we have better lighting on this campus or is it more important that
we have a chaplain?"

Looking at the three proposals for a college chaplain, YMCA President Adrian Long said, "I can't see any particular advantage
of any of them. There would be reservations by students if the new chaplain was a member of the faculty.
If the college chaplain were also the associate minister at the Davidson College Presbyterian Church, he would be too identified
with organized religion. The right type of personality could overcome these difficulties, and these are really the only two reasonable
proposals."

In Long's view, the college will not consider the possibility of an independent chaplain. He pointed out that Woodmansee was
not satisfied with his independent role in which he was isolated from the faculty and the church. It is commonly
known by those connected with the YMCA that Woodmansee felt he did not have enough to do, since about four
months out of each year students were not at Davidson.

In response to those who question the need for a chaplain, Long said, "It is important to have someone around
on an informal basis to talk to students. The problem with the clinical psychologists is that you have to make
an appointment to see them." Long could not cite how many students sought the advice of Woodmansee, but he believed
it was "quite a few."

YMCA President-elect Larry Duncan said, "The new chaplain should be his own man. Students would be uptight in their dealings
with the chaplain if he were a member of the faculty. Also, I do not believe that the Church would
accept an associate minister connected with Davidson College."

Whether or not the proposed new chaplain will be a member of the faculty may prove to be a touchy
issue.
