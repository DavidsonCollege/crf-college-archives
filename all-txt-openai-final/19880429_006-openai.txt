(Tell me, tell me,

What does a crow mean to a shaman?

Brown bark bark skin hand grasps the quill,
Twists it in his fingers, and their time-hued ridges
Chord the feather of the crow:
Like the wind, the wind,

That hushes on the crow’s wings.)

Beat and drum. Beat and drum. Beat and drum. Beat and

Ridges rise to rush the feather.

Dark bark hand slips from flesh to be

Power sluicing in the chords.

Brown smoke and this black, black crow

Rise with beat, beat.

Yawning earth and sky forever

Roll under their shadows, plains shadowy in distance.

Tell me, tell me,

What does a crow mean to a shaman?

Black eyes’ brown bark hand shakes, and he calls,
“It means a call, harsh like screech of crow,

It means a smoke. On the wind. Rushing. Over earth.
It means your black shadow

In the smoke between mountain and mountain,

Your talisman feather beating the wind on the plain.”

Beat. Cry. Beat. Cry. Beat. Cry.

(What does an omen mean to my shadow?

I see sailing wind chording my black feather’s power
And beating the smoke that is wind of my feather,
Wind fanning the blaze of my brown bark to smoke,
A brown smoke that coils out to others in shadow.)

-Douglas Gibson ’91
