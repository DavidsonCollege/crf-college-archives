pipes:

**Honor Code:**

The Honor System works because the students of this college make it work... [But], we must temper our idealism and
face certain facts. Although the members of the College might co-exist in an atmosphere of mutual respect for the Honor
System, there are others who do not share these values constantly coming onto the campus. Herein lies my warning: Davidson’s
Honor System must not be permitted to blind us to the harsh realities of the real world. We must not
allow our idealism, and the apparent effectiveness of the Code in certain areas of campus life, to lull us into
a false sense of security.

The Honor System is understandably a source of pride here at Davidson and it should continue to be so. The
atmosphere of honesty and trust that prevails among members of the College is wonderful. But we must keep in mind
the fact that trust at Davidson might well spell foolishness in the real world.

These are really his words.

After I confronted him, he would alternately plead with me not to spoil his path to riches and glory (I
believe he intends to be a United States Senator one day) and threaten me (“I can’t follow you around with
a gun for the rest of my life...”).

I have not described the student’s character out of spite; I have done so to make it clear that I
was plainly frightened dealing with him. Given a good opportunity, he would not hesitate, I think, to take revenge against
me. When he came to Davidson at the end of the summer to negotiate a settlement, I was too wary
of him to press him to accept any punishment. Mr. Currie and I met with him and decided he should
repay exactly what he stole without interest or punitive payments. He paid the bulk of what he owed immediately; he
agreed to repay the remainder soon afterwards. (I billed him for the final $150 he owed a week ago.) I
informed the Dean of Students when the student would come to Davidson, but the Dean did not attend the meeting.

Soon after the meeting, I told the Dean that I wanted to speak to one of the College’s lawyers about
the case to make sure that I was on safe legal ground. He scoffed at my request, and only after
repeated demands and weeks of waiting did he allow me to telephone one of the College’s lawyers. The lawyer said
he guessed I probably could be sued if I spoke about the case too often, but that he wasn’t much
on libel and slander. At least one can rest assured that, since my conversation with the lawyer lasted less than
five minutes, I did not run up the College’s legal expenses.

I also asked the Dean if the Honor Council could take some action against the student — a censure or
something like that. He replied that there was no precedent for convicting a student of an Honor Code violation after
a student’s graduation.

Looking back, I cannot believe the eagerness with which the Dean pronounced this case to be outside the Honor Code’s
jurisdiction. Does the Honor Code fail to have any force against guilty students the moment they graduate? To say yes
is to cynically devalue the Honor Code: it is to say that the Honor Code has meaning only for those
students currently enrolled in Davidson but is some anomaly of college life.

I am not advocating punishments for students whose transgressions are not discovered until after they graduate, and I am not
interested in seeing the student I caught punished. What I am concerned about is our resolve to make the Honor
Code work — all the time. How can we take pride in an Honor System that is completely impotent when
a guilty student — a possible felon — is awarded a diploma without ever so much as having his deeds
condemned? Retribution is not important. Upholding the integrity of the Honor System is.

Looking back, I also can’t believe the lack of support I received from anyone who had anything officially to do
with the Honor Code. The only College officers who worked with me were Mr. Currie and Davidson. Both are men
of integrity, but their jobs concern managing finances, not enforcing the Honor Code.

The Honor Code requires not only that one refrain from lying, cheating, and stealing but also that one turn in
those who do. I was obliged to turn in the student I caught, and I was willing to put myself
on the line in the process. I think any student would have done so in such a situation. But the
students’ duty to turn in violators is meaningless without support from the Dean’s Office.

It comes down to a question of stamina and courage. Are we willing to commit the resources to ensure that
the Honor System works as it should? — even when the case takes a long time to adjudicate? — even
when the issues are complex? — even when legal complications might arise? The Honor System does not work by magic
or faith but by our resolve to see it work even in the most difficult circumstances.
