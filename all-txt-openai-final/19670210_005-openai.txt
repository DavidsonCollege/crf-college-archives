**Student Opinion Differs Over PE**

(Davidson’s physical education program has been the subject of sometimes harsh criticism in recent years. In this first article of a three-part series, the writer presents and examines the prevailing student opinions about Davidson PE.)

Physical education, that much-criticized, little-changed hallowed tradition of Davidson, promotes more diversified opinions among the student body than the clichés from the sports publicity office. For every student who wants to change it, there is another student who wants to leave this required venture into the caverns of Johnston Gym just like it is. Very few students actually favor abolishing required PE. Those who do generally realize that any campaign of this nature would be fruitless considering the current emphasis on physical fitness by various authorities.

Many of the opponents of the present PE activity are members of the sophomore class, the group which has seen the demise of vespers and Monday assembly. A general gripe is the cut system which allows only five free cuts and four additional cuts which must be made up before the end of the semester for a student to pass the course. Another gripe is the written tests given at the end of each quarter. One outspoken sophomore noted, "The tests don't serve any purpose and each coach differs in the amount he considers the results." Another sophomore told of being put in softball after his soccer class enrollment became too large. After playing softball for the entire spring quarter, he was given a soccer test which he initially failed. Another student noted that the tests do not always cover the material undertaken in class, but some coaches give the answers to students before the test.

Another grievance is the faulty showers in the main locker room plus a constant absence of soap in the wall dispensers. Perhaps a good sign is the approval given to their first semester in physical education by many freshmen. Most freshmen lauded their quarter in soccer, especially under Harry Fogleman. Many experienced their first taste of tumbling and gymnastics and wrestling as well as soccer this fall. Their enthusiasm indicates that they want a basic PE program which introduces them to sports their high schools lacked.

The major criticism of most freshmen is the attitude of some of the coaches. One noted, "In the morning, their own sports shouldn't interfere, but they do." Another said, "Some coaches are great in their sport, but acted uninterested in the others." What kind of coach do PE students want? Notable praise went to Bob Brown who plays handball with one of his smaller classes and to Dick Short, who "really shows an interest" in the progress of his small weight lifting class. But in other sports, students want to go their own way. In basketball, a sophomore said, "They ought to help the guys who need help and let the rest of us play."

Another gripe of most sophomores is the fact that other than electing to take a quarter of activity at the Lake Campus, they are entirely at the whims of the Director of Physical Education as to their activity. PE 21-22 advertises election of activities in the college catalogue. The two philosophies of students are generally 1) the guys who believe "if you are going to sweat, why not get something out of it," and 2) the guys who use PE "to wake me up after physics." Many of the first group are former athletes who enjoy sports but are caught up in the whirlwind of campus activities. The latter is composed of guys who would rather sleep, study and not sweat too much. The favorite sport of many of the latter who were interviewed was volleyball because "we can stand around and not worry about getting hurt."

For some freshmen, PE has opened new fields of endeavor. One said, "I liked gymnastics because I had never had it before. Now I go down to the gym and do it a lot. Coach (Heath) Whittle cared about us doing it right." One sophomore, a campus leader, noted, "One and a half hours a week isn’t going to do you any good, but the value is what you learn. You can get something out of it if you want to. A little teaching of sports would go a long way."

NEXT WEEK: The Other Side: The Coaches

**MITCHELL RETURNS**

**Hoopsters Attack Redmen**

"We're all looking forward to this game," commented William and Mary Coach Warren Mitchell after practice yesterday, "but we'll treat it like any other. It’s tough for another team to win in the Coliseum. We have to play Furman down there on Monday night, but I guess for me the game Tuesday will be kind of like a homecoming."

Vaulting past the Richmond Spiders Tuesday to secure third place in the Southern Conference, the fast-improving Davidson Wildcats host second place William and Mary Tuesday night in the final regular season Charlotte Coliseum game of the season. In a preliminary game, the Wildkittens take on the yearlings of Duke, whom they beat, 63-54, in a comeback effort at Durham in December.

Coach Mitchell returns to face the team he helped to recruit with a well-balanced club, featuring six players with double-figure scoring averages. Good rebounding, defense, and balanced scoring characterize the Indians whom Mitchell brings to Charlotte. An up and down team, William and Mary employs basically a pattern offense, whose effectiveness varies according to their hot and cold shooting. One week ago, the Indians bombed The Citadel, 91-57, with six players tallying in double figures. David Walker paced W&M with 16, Dan Daugherty, Ron Panneton, and Ben Pomeroy led the attack. But this same club had to struggle to beat cellar-dwelling VMI, 64-57, Tuesday. Chief board threats are conference Pomeroy, Jim Rima, and Daugherty. Rima led Mitchell's Newport News team to the Virginia state championship the year before Mitchell signed on at Davidson. Daugherty, a 6-6, 220-pound sophomore, has been a pleasant surprise in the Tribe's hoop picture.

Prior to this crucial conference match, the ‘Cats journey to Milwaukee tomorrow to tangle with the Warriors of Marquette at 8:15 p.m. CST (9:15 p.m. Davidson time). The ‘Cats do not rest after the William and Mary game. Before they can enjoy Midwinters, they have to prove themselves again Thursday at the expense of Furman. The Paladins, always emboldened when playing the Wildcats in their own backyard, seek to avenge a 64-71 licking the ‘Cats gave them in Johnston Gym.

**TEAM LEADER**

**Moser Adds Talent, Control**

By DON SEWELL
Sports Writer

Dave Moser has been a man the Wildcats have relied on all season. Playing the point position on offense, Moser has been called upon game after game to use his fancy dribbling to bring the ball up the floor. Once in the front court, Moser has set up many scoring opportunities with his passing. The sophomore tri-captain from Fort Wayne, Ind. has shown great improvement this season and now stands as an established team leader.

Only 6-1, Moser hardly looks the part of a rebounder, but he is the third highest rebounder on the team, close behind second-place Tom Youngdale. Moser also does his share of scoring. Doing nearly all his shooting from the outside, he averages nine points a game, connecting on more than 40 percent of his shots from the field and nearly 85 percent of his free throw attempts. Moser has impressed both fans and opponents many times with his hard-driving jump shot. Shooting quickly, he often appears to be off balance when he puts the ball up, but his soft touch has sent many through the hoop.

The hard-pressing style of defense that troubled the Wildcats early in the season put pressure on Moser to spearhead the backcourt attack. Whether driving hard across the time line or evading his defender with a smooth behind-the-back dribble, Moser can be counted on to bring the ball up court. Several of the presses the ‘Cats have met this season have been zone presses, with a double-team on the man with the ball. Moser explains that he and his teammates have been able to beat this type of press because they have developed the necessary teamwork. Still, it is Moser who carries most of the backcourt load.

"We have confidence in Dave's bringing the ball up court," said teammate Wayne Huckel. "He allows us to think more about setting up the offense once he gets the ball to us."

"I don’t use that behind-the-back dribble to show off or anything," added Moser. "It is just something that I have done since high school when I have needed to."

MOSER CRANKS UP 'CATATTACK Cool Soph Shows Off Ball-Handling Talents

Coach Lefty Driesell praised the redheaded guard for his brand of play. “Dave has improved a great deal in handling the ball against a press. He has seen a lot of them now, and all he ever needed was experience to be able to beat his defenders,” Driesell added that Moser’s performances in the St. Joseph and Richmond games have been particularly outstanding. He said that the reason for this was that Moser has been driving for the basket more often, sharpening the offensive threat.

A quick look at two plays from the St. Joe game illustrates Moser’s earning this praise. Twice up the court, he saw Huckel underneath the basket on a fast break, with a defender near him. Both times Moser drove to the right of the basket, forcing the defender to commit himself. Then, with quick and accurate passes, he sent the ball to Huckel for easy buckets.

Moser has been a guest on the Lefty Driesell television show several times this year, often being called on to describe plays or analyze Davidson's play. “I really enjoy being on Coach Driesell's show. I think it is good experience because it forces me to think, then act immediately.” It is this immediate action that Moser excels in. His lightning-fast passes and quick shots show that he can react immediately to a sudden opportunity. “I have always felt that the whole idea of competition was to see who could think and act the fastest,” he said. “I love to compete.”

Moser has been pleased by the team's performances during the last two games. He also said he feels confident about the rest of the schedule. “If we can gain some momentum by winning our last games, it will send us into the Southern Conference Tournament in a winning frame of mind. Taking the tournament is the big thing for us now.”

Because he did not play in any football games during his sophomore year, he has one more year of football eligibility remaining. Poole confirmed that he will play football again next year. Poole, a psychology major from Huntersville, explained that he will complete his major requirements during the first semester and will participate in a student-teaching program during the second semester. Working his way up from third-string quarterback during his sophomore year, Poole began his junior year as second-string signal-caller, but performed so well when he came off the bench, he was actually at one time leading the Southern Conference in touchdown passes while riding the bench. Ascending to a starting role midseason, he led the Wildcats to their first winning season since 1958.

During the 1966 season, Poole set conference records in pass completions, pass attempts, single-game pass completions, pass attempts, yards passing, and yards total offense with 1,925. He set nine new Davidson records while leading the ‘Cats to a 4-5 record in Head Coach Homer Smith's sophomore season. After being the only Davidson player to win first-team all-conference honors, he tied with West Virginia halfback Garrett Ford in voting for the outstanding player in the conference this season.

CONFERENCE STANDINGS
West Va. 6-1
William and Mary 6-3
DAVIDSON 5-3
Richmond 6-5
The Citadel 5-4
G. Washington 4-5
East Carolina 4-6
Furman 2-4
VMI 2-10

Ever since Sports Illustrated picked the ‘Cats No. 1 the day before they bowed to St. Joseph in the second game of the 1964-65 season, the Hawks had outcaged the Wildcats for two seasons. But Saturday was a different story. Combining a newly-found aggressiveness and teamwork with the ever-sharp shooting of Mike O’Neill and Dave Moser, the ‘Cats shocked the high-flying Hawks from Philadelphia, 66-65, and served notice of things to come in the future. To prove it was no fluke, they proceeded to spin the Spiders of Richmond, 94-79, in a rare clash here Tuesday.

ECC Pirates, 34-3
By BOB STUBBS

East Carolina forfeited five of the nine matches and won only one of the others as the Davidson matmen cruised to their fifth win of the wrestling season, 34-3, over the Pirates here yesterday. The only official Davidson loss of the afternoon was in the 123-pound class as Howie Metadar decisioned Colin Hudson, giving the Pirates a 3-0 lead. After that, it was all Davidson.

Dean Cromartie edged by Harry Davis, 5-3, in the 147-pound class, while Terry O’Hair beat Dave Clelland, 8-3, in the 167 match. In the heavyweight division, Lowell Bryan easily defeated the Pirates’ Billy Smith, 9-0. Though the other weight classes were each five-point gifts to the Davidson cause, East Carolina entered freshmen to compete against the ‘Cat grapplers in exhibition matches. Pirate Tom Ellenberger beat Joe Buffington, who had been previously undefeated this season, 7-4, in the 130-pound class, but Julian Prosser soundly defeated Sandy Smith, 5-1, in the 145 class. In the 177-pound division, Kerry Keith had to work hard to edge by Mike Murray, 4-3. ECC did not enter anyone in the 152 and 160 classes, enabling Al Jasper and Duff Armfield to enjoy the afternoon without working up a sweat.

In preliminary matches, Sam McDowell of ECC pinned freshman Pierce Irby in the 167-pound event and Richard Martin beat Steve Bain, 6-5, in an extra heavyweight match. “East Carolina is young and has great potential,” said Cromartie, one of the winners. “They were not in as good shape as we were. This helped us considerably.”

Coach Charlie Parker seemed to be pleased by his team's performance. “Hudson lost, but he is still 5-1 for the season. His match could have gone either way. Last year he lost to the same man twice.” He added, “William and Mary has canceled our match for Feb. 24. So, our next home match will be with The Citadel Feb. 27.” Parker added that The Citadel is “the best by far in the Southern Conference.” The ‘Cat grapplers visit their 5-1 record next against N.C. State next Friday.

Maloy Probably Out For Season

Mike Maloy, flashy pivotman for the undefeated Wildkittens, will probably miss the five remaining games on the freshman schedule after suffering a broken left hand and a dislocated left index finger in a fall Wednesday. The accident could deal a serious blow to the Wildkittens' chances for an undefeated season, a feat never accomplished in Davidson basketball history. Maloy suffered the injuries on his way to lunch Wednesday. Witnesses said that he slipped on the steps between Chambers Building and the College Union and broke the hand trying to retard the fall. His left forearm and hand were put in a cast Wednesday afternoon.

The 6-7, 200-pound Maloy was the club’s leading scorer with a 22-point average and was tied with Doug Cook as rebounding leader with 15 snatches per game. The Wildkittens, undefeated through 11 games, have Clemson, Duke, Furman, The Citadel, and N.C. State remaining on their schedule. The last game, recently scheduled, will be played March 1 in Greensboro. Probable replacements in the starting lineup for Maloy are Randy Jones, Johnny Baker, or Davis Liles.

Sigs Clip Gams To Pace

The Kappa Sigs lengthened their unblemished winning streak to nine victories this week with a 61-51 decision over fourth-ranked Phi Gams. Pete Ort and Barry St. Clair paced the Sig attack with 14 points apiece, while Walt Garrison chalked up another 12 to the winners’ credit. Doug Rhymes was the big man for the Gams with 26 points, while teammate Dan Graham shot 15.

Meanwhile, third-ranked Sigma Chi remained a viable contender with a 48-38 win over the Pi Kapps. Charlie Taylor paced the Pi Kapp scorers with 15 points while Pete Norton and Tommy Clayton teamed up to score 13 points apiece. The winless Sig Eps fell again this week, thereby assuring themselves a comfortable slot in the undisputed bottom. This time it was the revived Independents who provided the misery. Ray English and Bruce Weidner hit 16 apiece, while four other Independent sophomores scored in double figures. Fletcher Hartsell and Gene Bennett saved the Sig Eps from total embarrassment, accounting for nearly 66 percent of the losers’ totals. Hartsell hit 20 points while Bennett garnered 18.

Meanwhile, the Gams racked up a big win over the Betas, 58-47. Rhymes led the scoring with 27, while Dave King added another 10 to the Fiji cause. The Betas still aren't exactly sure who played for them, since a Beta spokesman said they played without the services of Arch McCallum, Jim Timmons, and Sam Cathey. Hank Strickland paced the Betas with 19 points while Joe Rice followed with 15.

The B's picked up two wins this week, one a 44-42 edge over the KA's and a 53-46 decision over the Pikas. K.D. Weeks was high man for the B's both times, chalking up 15 against the KA's and 22 against the Pikas. John Croom hit 15 points and some of the opposition for the Pikas, while Rick Harrell led the KA's with 15.

The ATO's added another win to their totals this week with a 79-40 romp over the KA's. Dave Jennings paced the Taus with 18, while Harrell led the KA's with 12.
