#### Women’s Tennis Off to State

Women’s tennis, with a 12-4 regular season record, left for the State Tournament yesterday. Although Davidson faces tough opposition, Coach Pat Miller expects to be one of the top three teams in Division II. If the Cats finish in first or second place, they will advance to the Regionals on May 9.

Davidson has been playing well in the past few weeks. Although the girls lost 6-3 last Thursday to an aggressive Peace team, they won all their doubles and split sets in the singles. Queens offered little opposition Monday, and after winning a close match against Appalachian State Tuesday, the women will enter the State Tournament on a high note. —NINA BROOME

#### Men's Track Loses to Citadel

The men’s track team fell 54-102 to The Citadel this past weekend at Whittle Track. Coach Karl Kremser commented that he was surprised by the difference in the scores, which “obviously doesn’t indicate the strong effort put forth by all members of the team.” Indeed, as Coach Kremser began intensifying the workouts last week, seven Cat trackmen posted personal bests in eight events. John Hoots paced the distance crew with a 4:04/1:58 1500m/800m double, finishing first in both events and running “one of the fastest doubles ever at Davidson,” according to Coach Kremser.

Hurdler Dick Jones also ran well, turning in a 53.80 400m hurdles (.05 seconds off his school record) and a personal best 50.05 400m dash. Other personal bests were recorded by Jeff Morrow (9:59) and John Davis (10:10) in the 3000m steeplechase (taking first and second place), Terry Morrow (4:14) and Tim Ritchies (4:25) in the 1500m, and Chris Tiernan (2:03) in the 800m. Greg Burnard, who is recovering from a long week of hard work both on and off the track, ran a 16:14 5000m, placing second in that event. Coach Kremser reiterated his praise for the distance corps’ dedication and effort, especially the 800m runners, whom he has worked with closely this year, in molding the strongest group of half-milers ever at Davidson. —VAN BECK

#### Men’s Tennis Falls to Furman

The men’s tennis team lost a tough match to Furman last Friday 6-3, as Nevins Todd and Rick Johnston picked up the singles wins and the incomparable doubles duo of Harry Griffith and Jay Gepfert notched the other victory. The Cats' record now is 8-6, but they have had seven rain-outs. Senior Griffith stated that “8-6 is not so impressive but we realistically could be 15-6 if we could've played those matches. We are a good team.”

With the Southern Conference Tournament two weeks away, Coach Jeff Frank commented, “We really think we’ll do well in the tournament, but this weekend will be critical in determining the seedings.” The Cats have three Southern Conference matches remaining, against Appalachian (Friday), and The Citadel and Western Carolina (on Saturday). Nick Petrou summed up the rest of the season: “We’re on all four burners now. We’re gonna surprise some people at the tournament.” —JOE FORD

#### Sailors Take 2nd in SAISA

Davidson’s sailing team raced to a fine second place finish this past weekend in the South Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Association’s Team Championships. College of Charleston claimed first place in the Championships held on Lake Norman.

The two-day event featured six schools with three boats from each school entered. After Saturday’s races, Davidson stood tied for first with College of Charleston; both schools were 4-0 on the day. Sunday saw the Cat sailors drop a single race which pushed them to second behind Charleston for the overall championships. Cat vessels were skippered by Will Benson, Kirk Williams, and Don Rose while crew members included Tracy Thompson, Virginia Robertson, and Donya Boylston. As a result of its first place SAISA finish, Charleston will advance to the national finals to be hosted by Harvard.

In another regatta competition on Lake Norman this past weekend, Greg Lens and Jeff Harris coasted to second place.
