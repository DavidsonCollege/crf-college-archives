EDITORIAL

MIS-STATEMENTS CORRECTED

Either willfully and maliciously, or through pure ignorance, there appears to be a strong tendency on the part of the
staff and editorial columns of the “Gamecock,” the paper published by the University of South Carolina, to wander from the
path of correct statements, in regard to the Davidson-Carolina cancellation. If the case was one of “ignorance,” as we would
like to believe it is, we would like to make certain corrections, and we feel that the above-mentioned paper should
make such corrections in their columns.

The statement is made that Davidson wanted South Carolina to play a S. I. A. A. team, for which the
contract did not call. No such demand was made, and only a team was wanted which could come under their
own rules. The statement is also made that “Davidson had every fact upon which to base their requests, two weeks
before the contest.” Yet the true status of the case is that it was only after a phone request on
the day before the game was scheduled, that the Davidson authorities were able to get any kind of list of
men, and this list could not be O.K.'d by any member of the faculty of South Carolina.

Furthermore, it is stated that “The University authorities have shown that they wished to play Davidson under 1915 rules.” This
is such a plain error that it would seem that it could at least have been avoided. For twenty minutes
at one time, over the long-distance phone, the request was made time after time that the University abide by the
contract and play under these rules, but this they would not do.

The statement was also made that “Athletic relations had been severed with Davidson.” If this is true, there has been
no official notification of this fact, and unless the South Carolina authorities are so busy investigating the standing of their
players that they do not have time to properly notify the Davidson authorities of an action of this kind, we
are inclined to believe that such action will at least be deferred until the faculty of the University of South
Carolina have an opportunity to apologize to Davidson for attempting to use players against them who were not eligible.

While Davidson always enjoys a contest with an institution several times its own size, and is proud of the many
victories, the men who make her teams are bona fide students in every sense of the word, and there is
never a doubt as to their eligibility. We regret that it has been necessary to make these corrections, and no
further notice will be given to an incident which is already closed. The memory only remains and it will be
many long days before the public will forget the facts regarding the University of South Carolina athletics which have been
revealed within the past few weeks.

Dr. Melton Clark, father of Woodrow Clark ('18), addressed the Y. M. C. A., Thursday night. His subject was “What
Should Guide a Man in the Choice of His Life’s Work?” Men make the most important decisions of life before
they are twenty-five. The aim has a vital connection with the end. First, Profit is to be considered. It is
the lowest but the fundamental consideration. The best profit is that which comes not immediately but in the far future.
Next to be considered is Power. “Not how I can get most power, but how can I best develop the
power in me, and best give it out.” One must give his best to God, though it necessitates the burying
of his life. Dr. Clark spoke impressively to a large, attentive crowd.

THE CAROLINA TRACK MEET. Recently an invitation was received from the Athletic Association of the University of North Carolina to
compete in a four-mile cross country run. Davidson has never been in for anything of this kind before, yet several
men are thinking about making the trip. It is entirely a voluntary affair, and whoever goes must stand the expenses
of this trip, since it will not be under the supervision of the Athletic Association.

The Finance Committee of the College, composed of Messrs. George E. Wilson, R. A. Dunn, and W. H. Belk, all
of Charlotte, held a meeting on the Hill last week, at which time the laying of a four-inch main from
the present wells to the water main on the campus was authorized. This will provide for better pumping of the
water.
