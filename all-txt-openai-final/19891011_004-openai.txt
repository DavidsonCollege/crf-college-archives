This huge tree in front of Little dorm stood no chance with Hugo, which snapped it virtually in half. About 231 trees were damaged or felled.

**Hurricane pounds campus: $400,000 in tree damage**

**Hugo’s signs are still on campus**

The signs of Hurricane Hugo's devastating visit are still present in Davidson three weeks after it ravaged the Carolinas. Stories of how one survived Hugo are still being told and will be repeated for a long time. Students will forever remember the unexpected holiday from classes.

The force of reported 87 mile per hour winds strewed the campus with debris and downed 231 trees, some of them more than 100 years old. The majority of them have now been cleared, and Davidson's campus definitely has a barer look.

The dollar value of damages suffered by the college has not yet been determined, according to Grover Meetze, director of facilities planning. The value of trees is more than $400,000, at $2,000 per tree.

The hurricane devastated the Caribbean islands before tearing through Charleston, S.C. Meteorologists misjudged the time of the storm's arrival in Charlotte by approximately eight hours.

“No one could have predicted that [the storm],” said Will Terry, dean of students. “But we could be Charleston, so we have something to be thankful for.”

Power crews from as far away as Ohio worked to restore electricity to the town and campus.

Although building damage at the college was not extensive, roofs were unmercifully battered. Watts dorm had the most serious damage—a portion of its roof was blown off. Knox, Akers, and Irwin dorms also suffered some roof damage. Although a tree fell on Rusk eating house, no extensive damage occurred. The roof of Johnston gym suffered water leakage.

At the home of President John Kuykendall, a large oak tree was felled, taking roof shingles with it and damaging the porch roof and chimney.

The college was saved from losing on-campus phone service since all telephone lines are underground. “We were lucky in that respect,” said Meetze.

Meetze compared the current recovery period to the one following the Chambers fire of 1921. “We're lucky,” he stated, noting that more damage did not occur to buildings. “It would be difficult to replace historical buildings.”

The town also took a beating, and according to town clerk Bill Brannon, the dollar value of damages has not yet been determined.

During the time that electricity was suspended, extra policemen were on hand at night to guard streets against vandals. First Step Sports, of Main Street, suffered a broken window, the only reported case of vandalism.

**After Hugo, volunteers emerged to clean up**

By RAFAEL J.

Amid the destruction and ruin of trees and structures resulting from Hurricane Hugo's heavy winds last weekend, there was a small, yet potent, spark of hope. In a fascinating display of communion, several hundred members of the college community collaborated with the grounds crew to begin the laborious cleanup process.

President John Kuykendall, whose own house was a victim of falling trees, described the volunteer effort as “the epitome of the Davidson spirit.” Kuykendall noted that he was inspired by the effort, saying “it made me want to join in.”

Students, teachers, administrators, and staff assisted with the campus’s restoration as best they could. Some raked leaves and gathered branches. Others attempted to dislodge hanging limbs. One administrator, exhibiting lumberjack boots, goggles, and protective clothing, brought his chainsaw to cut fallen branches.

Several student Commons workers brought refreshments to the volunteers.

The grounds crew was delighted with the help they received from the college community.

Allen Sherrill, a Davidson groundskeeper, was busy this weekend chainsawing tree limbs. “It was great,” he said, in reference to the help. “They got a lot done on Friday and Saturday.” He emphasized the students’ genuine concern for the campus saying, “They take pride in the way the school looks.”

J. Hernandez-Chiroldes, professor of Spanish, was recording the destruction with his camera. “I really felt touched by the students’ gesture,” he said. “That's the Davidson tradition—people working for other people.”

Senior Robert Lovas, a volunteer, also stated that “it was great” and “everyone did a great job.” However, Lovas expressed his dissatisfaction with the number of volunteers, stating that he felt more students should have helped in the cleanup effort.

Davidson College has long prided itself on its tradition of academic excellence. Contingent with this reputation is a rigid five-day class schedule which has been rarely modified. Yet, three weeks ago academics were forced to bend to nature when Hurricane Hugo downed electricity lines, making class sessions impossible. It was one of the rare times in college history that such a need arose.
