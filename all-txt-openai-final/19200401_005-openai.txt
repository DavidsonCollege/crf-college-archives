PEANUT PARCHER

T. H. SPENCE, Editor

J. M. Dunlap, Editor.

It has been suggested, since Tom
Spence has relinquished his author-
ity over the Peanut Parcher, that
his picture be removed from the top
of the column.

Heard at Sprunt Field.
Fair One: “Did he steal first base?”

“The best game I ever saw lasted
22 innings and there wasn’t a score.”
Covington: “That’s nothing, I
once played on a team that went all
summer without making a hit.”

1st R.O.T.C. Rookie: “What
does our next review cover?”

2nd Ditto: “The South-West cor-
ner of the campus.”

S. Green (entering Sander’s room):
“Eddie, loan me a hair pin.”

Will some mathematician please
tell us what the fourth dimension
of Fatty Campbell is?”

The ancient astronomer who fell
in a ditch while gazing at the stars
now has a counterpart. Big Liz
sprained his ankle while watching
the fire arrive Saturday.

Roberts: “Don't you think my
mustache is becoming?”

Fresh: “It may be coming, but
it’s not here yet.”

In Numbers is Safety.

I have often had it said to me
by Sages, wise and old

“It's fine to love but a single lass,
“One lass, to have, to hold.”

Yes, it's fine to love but a single lass
While she to you is true
But it’s better by far to have re-
served
A lass to fall back to.

For you know not when the lass
you think
To be above all, true blue
Is going to fall for another man
And give the “pink slip” to you.

The snakes in grape juice delir-
ium tremens are naught but
summer butterflies.

Soph Red Smith: “I got in the
show on my looks.”
Fresh C. G.: “You must have
backed in.”

The question now is, where is the
square?

A freshman has made application
for a rubber, one that will rub out
his past and stretch out his future.

Some people seem to have the idea
that you could put a dozen medicine
balls in a pill box.

Applied Baseball.

When you meet a good-looker—
make a Hit.
If you succeed, then try a Walk.
Should she Slide, by all means Catch.
And if she faints, then Fan.
When starting to propose—don’t
Balk.
And if successful—try a squeeze
Play.
Ask her Dad—to play Safe.
But if he refuses you can—Steal.
And should he Strike Out after you
—Run.
