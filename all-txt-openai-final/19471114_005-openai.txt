GRA-Y GRIDDERS
Introducing Ernie Stricklin
The many victories of the season were often due to the goal-line stands and defensive plays of Ernie Stricklin. One of the big reasons why they were able to hold off those successive six-point tries is Ernie Stricklin. It was the same Stricklin who was responsible for our repeated gains through tackle by Mack Erwin, Williams, Turner, Sifford, and the others. The backs usually get the credit for the spectacular off-tackle runs, but if it were not for Stricklin and his cohorts, the score would be different. Ernie tilts the scales at 205 pounds, standing 5 feet nine inches, and every inch a tackle. Our star of the week hails from Barium Springs, where he began his football career in '36, playing a smashing guard on the 80-pound team. He played varsity ball from the first team to '43 when he entered the Navy. Ernie says this was his big mistake, but from talking to him, we see that his life began. He was stationed in New York, Lido Beach, and Little Creek. Then from there, he went to sea on an LSM. He manned a 40-107 gun at Hora Hora, the Philippines, Haiti, Okinawa, Cebu, and Mindanao, and helped unload troops in Japan. Immediately after being discharged, he entered Davidson. Ernie is more than an undefeated wrestler; he is also a baseball and basketball player. While at Barium, he was a public speaker, played the piano, and was involved in dramatics. At Davidson, he is in the D Club, Phi Society, and is president of the Independent Organization. In this capacity, he is proving to be a leader on the campus, having instigated the society's securing of a social house. He is also planning a function and a banquet for Mid-winters. He is expected to be an outstanding man on the wrestling team this year. He likes to write, read, and is interested in philosophy. “Strick” has more Carter's Little Liver Pills than he will ever need. He has had pretty women, millionaires, and wild ones. In other words, he tames them. The only catch is they all wanted to get married, but not now. So you see, Ernie is a man with a future that will bring out these qualities as he studies for the Gospel ministry.

Pictured above with Coaches John McBride and Bill Gamble is the Davidson Gra-Y squad which gave Barium Springs’ 100-pounders a run for their 20-0 victory Monday afternoon. The youngsters have won over Huntersville and Westover and lost to Cornelius and Benton.
