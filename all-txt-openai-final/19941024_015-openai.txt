Confidence carries
women's soccer to
victory v. Ga. Southern

By Kristy Ford

Coming off of a two-game
winning streak, the women’s soc-
cer team confidently approached
Friday’s game against Georgia
Southern. After a strong first half,
the team led 2-0. However, they
didn’t let up and pushed forth to
score five goals in the second half
to shut out the Eagles 7-0.

Aided by great defensive plays
from Shannon Lowrance, Melissa
Moser, Kelly Schmidt, Leslie
Greiner, and Jodie Lewis, goalie
Liz Schaper recorded her third shut-
out this season. The defense, in its
last three outings, has held their
opponents to just one goal. The
defense credits their recent strength
to an overall improvement in com-
munication and support of one an-
other.

“This trust we have in one
another is something that has
gradually evolved and really come
out in the last three games,” says
sophomore Melissa Moser. “I al-
ways know that there will be some-
one there to back me up, which
makes the whole game more relax-
ing and enjoyable and allows us to
play better.”

“The defense—the whole
team—is playing with more confi-
dence and composure,” says
Schaper. “We did an excellent job
of keeping the ball on their end of
the field.”

Offensively, the team has been
working hard to convert on some
of the opportunities that they have
had all season. Although the team
has been getting shots on goal, it
was not until recently that they
began to convert on free kicks and
corners that just weren’t being con-
verted. In practice, the team has
been running numerous shooting
drills to improve reactions to un-
expected shots.

“I think we were passing too
much before and waiting for the
perfect shot,” said freshman Amy
Kanoff, who has come on strong
recently with three goals on Friday
and two assists the weekend be-
fore. “Now we are finishing on
free kicks, corner kicks, and scrappy
goals that we just didn’t get be-
fore.”

“I feel like our confidence in
one another and in ourselves is
what has helped us to come to-
gether as a team and thus perform
better,” says sophomore Kelly
Ammann. Kanoff agrees: “We
have been working out of the de-
fense and the midfield has been a
connector between the offense and
the defense rather than something
the ball is just passed over.”

In the victory over Georgia
Southern, there was a wide range
of scorers. Amy Kanoff pulled a
hat trick, and other players with
one apiece were Lora Chavis,
Claudia Lombard, Heather
Wineberg, and Kelly Schmidt.
The team hopes to carry this
winning streak into their next three
regular season games and the
Southern Conference Tournament.
They face N.C. State on Tuesday
and finish out their regular season
conference games next weekend at
Appalachian State on Saturday.
The season finale is against Furman
at 2:00 Sunday. The match against
Furman is the team’s last home
game, as they will try to redeem
their only conference loss of the
season. A win against Furman
would put the team in excellent
standing for the conference tour-
nament on November 5 and 6.
