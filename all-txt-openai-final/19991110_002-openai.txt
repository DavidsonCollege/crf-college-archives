Davidson College honored outstanding students, faculty, and a distinguished alumni jurist at Fall Convocation last Saturday during the college’s Parent’s Weekend. The college presented its Thomas Jefferson Award for teaching to Laurence S. “Larry” Cain, professor of physics. Cain was praised for his commitment to rigorous undergraduate teaching, unquestioned personal integrity and candor, and unwavering service to college, church, and community.

Cain had previously won the college’s Omicron Delta Kappa Teaching Award. His expertise as an educator and as a physicist has been called upon by other colleges for external departmental reviews, by the National Science Foundation and the Ford Foundation for grant assessments, by the Southeastern Section of the American Physical Society for service on its executive committee, and by the Educational Testing Service for the Physics Advanced Placement Reading.

Cain began teaching at Davidson 21 years ago. He has served on many college committees and task forces, and chaired the task force on athletics. He has been a community volunteer with the Davidson-Cornelius Daycare Center, Habitat for Humanity, and Davidson Youth Baseball and Soccer. His extraordinary participation at Davidson College Presbyterian Church has led some to mistake him for an employee there. He has been volunteer treasurer, developed the church’s original financial software package, served as a member and Clerk of the Session, taught a Sunday School class, and overseen the modernization of the church’s sound system.

The college also announced two new holders of prestigious named professorships. Ruth L. Ault, professor of psychology, will be the inaugural holder of the Nancy and Erwin Maddrey Professorship. Maddrey, a 1963 Davidson graduate, is president and CEO of Delta Woodside Corporation in Greenville, S.C. Maddrey has provided his alma mater outstanding leadership in fundraising and alumni affairs as a volunteer and member of the Board of Trustees. Maddrey said he and his spouse established the professorship “because we believe the school is only as good as those professors who are there to lead and teach the students.” He continued, “Good students come where there are good professors, not the other way around. We felt that, in a small way, this professorship would help to maintain the high level of faculty excellence.”

Clark Ross, vice president of academic affairs, said Ault was selected to hold the chair “because she has demonstrated a strong commitment to a rigorous undergraduate education, has compiled an impressive record of professional attainments, and has provided superior college and community service.” Ault began teaching at Davidson in 1979. She received the college’s Thomas Jefferson Award for teaching in 1996. Her research focuses on children’s cognitive and intellectual development, and also on techniques of teaching. For five years, Ault has been a consulting editor for the journal Teaching of Psychology. She has published two books and a myriad of articles in professional journals; presented numerous conference papers and invited addresses; and led seminars and workshops on a variety of topics.

The Maddrey Professorship joins the Watson and the Stuart Dickson professorships as the third endowed faculty position currently in the psychology department. Ault said, “This is a tribute to the strength and quality of the psychology department, and the new possibilities afforded us by the new Watson Life Sciences Building, which provides a wonderful working environment for teaching, conducting research, and collaborating.”

Lauren W. Yoder, professor of French and chair of that department, was named as the new James Sprunt Professor. This professorship was established in 1925, and most recently was held by David Kaylor of the religion department. Yoder was cited for his global view of undergraduate education.and for prompting others with his quiet and gentle manner to recognize our responsibilities to others. A graduate of Eastern Mennonite College, Yoder received his master’s and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Iowa. He has taught at Davidson since 1973, specializing in African and Caribbean literature. He has twice served as director of Davidson’s Center for Interdisciplinary Studies, and has served on numerous faculty committees, task forces, and search committees. He has traveled abroad extensively, and is currently in Tours, France, as resident director of the college’s Junior Year Abroad program there. Yoder and his spouse, Suzy, spent 1995-1997 based in the African country of Burundi as regional director for the Mennonite Central Committee, working on relief, development, and peace-building initiatives with warring factions there.

The college conferred an honorary Doctor of Laws degree on J. Dickson Phillips, Jr., a 1943 graduate who has earned esteem as a soldier, academician, and as a federal judge. Born in Scotland County, N.C., Phillips joined the armed forces immediately after his graduation from Davidson and served as an officer in the Seventeenth Airborne Division during the European Campaign of World War II. He received the Bronze Star for valor, Presidential Citation, and the Purple Heart. After the war, he earned a law degree from UNC, and was editor of the “Law Review.” He practiced law in Laurinburg and Fayetteville, then returned to UNC as a professor and later dean of the law school. In 1978 President Carter appointed him as a judge to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, where he served for 20 years. During that time, the North Carolina Bar Association presented him with its two highest awards. He also served his alma mater as a trustee for twenty years and was vice chair of the board. In that capacity, he wrote the college’s constitution and its Code of Disciplinary Procedure, which has guided the student judicial process.

Featured speaker at Convocation was Amb. Edward Brynn, associate vice chancellor for international programs at UNCC. Speaking on “America As ‘City on the Hill’ in the 21st Century,” Brynn emphasized to Davidson students that the U.S. is increasingly affected by events and trends beyond our borders. He urged them to avoid the notion of American “exceptionalism” and be prepared to work with others around the globe to help shape our mutual destinies.

Four students also received awards. The Goodwin-Exxon Awards for character, sportsmanship, and consideration went to sophomore Jeremy M. Campbell, junior Moniece A. Robinson, and senior Britta K. Toleman. The Alumni Award for highest academic average during the freshman year was won by Brandt A. Leibe of Houston, Tex.
