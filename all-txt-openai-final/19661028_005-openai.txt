**DEAR HOMECOMING DATE:**

Unless you are an old pro at this game, you probably have been wondering just what Davidson Homecoming '66 will
be like. Some of you are sure you won't lose your cool this weekend and some of you are so
scared that if someone yelled “raid,” you'd... well, you get the idea.

Since everyone else in this newspaper likes to write about sports (for one reason or another), this column is going
to deviate from sports. This week the purpose of this piece of trash is to discuss the higher things in
life. Such high things as your date. Not all of you will have dates in this category, but the ones
of you that do, will spend the weekend listening to your date tell you how he isn’t.

Let’s discuss strategy. Every team, whether it is subsidized or not, uses strategy. Since the more idealistic (or idealess) Young
Turks on this campus believe that it is immoral for someone to score more than they do, they have lashed
out at it. Strategy involves using your head, which is something professors like to encourage us to do (though they
probably didn’t have this in mind).

Davidson’s Wildcats, led by record-breaking quarterback Jimmy Poole, take on The Citadel's Bulldogs tomorrow in the 1966 Homecoming Classic.

**SELLOUT EXPECTED**

The game renews a rivalry which started in 1909. A capacity crowd is expected for tomorrow’s 2 p.m. kickoff at
Richardson Field.

In a surprise move, Coach “Red” Parker of The Citadel started 10 sophomores in last week's loss to East Carolina.
He stated that he felt they could do the job against Davidson and improve upon their 2-4 record. With no
key injuries, the soldiers will be at full strength against Davidson. Parker said he was expecting a fired-up effort by
the ‘Cats in their Homecoming game with Poole throwing a lot of bombs at us.

“We'll have to cover everything,” he said, “because Poole is not only a great passer, but he can really scramble,
too. Offensively, we'll do what Davidson will let us do." Parker is hoping for a low-scoring contest. “The lower the
score, the better for us because we can't score too well.”

Parker expects a tough game. “They beat us last year, 14-0, and we expect them to bounce back from last
week's loss to Richmond and to be up for their Homecoming game.” “It should be a great game!” said Davidson
Coach Homer Smith. “They have moved the ball real well, but the biggest problem we face is their defense.”

**CATS GO HOLLYWOOD**

Actress Diane McBain, former star of the television series “Surfside Six,” visited the Wildcat roundballers’ practice Tuesday to present the
team with a 31-inch “D”. Coach Lefty Driesell said the “D” signified “Diane, Defense, and Davidson.” Along with the large
“D”, she gave each player a small monogrammed emblem. Miss McBain was in Charlotte attending the convention of the North
and South Carolina Film Exhibitors Association. Her visit was also in conjunction with the Charlotte opening of her new movie
with Elvis Presley later this month. Looking on, left to right, are Bob Pickens, Dave Moser, Tom Youngdale, Rocky Crosswhite,

**Luckless ‘Cats Rewrite SC, DC Record Ledgers**

Although not having rousing success in the won-loss column, the Wildcats are breaking records every time they take the field.
Quarterback Jimmy Poole, the Southern Conference offensive leader, is rewriting the Davidson College record book with every pass. Poole has
completed 61 percent (90 for 147) for 948 yards. He has also rushed for 151 yards giving him 1099 total
yards — a Davidson record. Against East Carolina, Poole set a new Southern Conference single-game record for most passes attempted
(50) and most passes completed (30). In the same game, Poole passed for 291 yards, also a Davidson record.

Poole’s main receivers have been a great boost to the Wildcats. Caldwell has punted 21 times for 859 yards, or
an average of 40.9 yards per punt. Caldwell tied an SC record with a punt of 80 yards against Richmond.
Caldwell averaged 54 yards on five punts in the same game.

**CONFERENCE STANDINGS**

Rikard has caught 26 passes for 331 yards and one touchdown. His total of 134 yards on pass receptions against
East Carolina set a new Davidson record. Billy Taylor also broke a college record by catching 10 passes against East
Carolina. Taylor also leads the Wildcats in rushing with 213 yards in 63 rushes. Kerry Keith has gained 199 yards
in 54 attempts.

The ‘Cats fell behind in the first quarter as a pass from center went out of the end zone, over
punter Tommy Caldwell's head making the score 2-0. The lack of depth of Davidson's diminishing Dirty Thirty was cited as
a factor in the defeat by Smith. In addition to the already large number of players either sidelined or sidelined
with injuries, linemen Jeff Pflugner was put out of action. The ‘Cats could not push across the winning touchdown and
saw the clock run out with the ball still on the 10.

**Everyone has his own plans for the weekend. Consider the battle plan of the cool senior:**

“Well, I plan to play it by ear most of the time. It won't be an hour after she gets
here that she will be crawling all over me. I won’t have to do a thing because by playing it
cool, my girl will show she’s as horny as I am. I can just control my emotions better than she
can. Just between you and me, I crave her bod. So by having no plan at all, I'll have a
good time. The main problem is keeping my cool. I'm pretty cool, it’s true, but being alone out here with
all these boys does strange things to a person. And I haven’t had a date since Wednesday night up in
Mooresville, so you see how love-starved I am. But she will think I am such a good guy because I
don’t attack her like the sophomores do. I let her attack me. It always works.”

No doubt this guy is so full of himself that he will not have room for anything but a fifth
of Old Crow. But he will be cool.

**Briefly let’s consider the junior class. One junior told me, “My dad finally gave me a car this year and
I'm going to use it. When he asked me just what model would be the most useful at Davidson, I
told him I wanted a big trunk. I'm going to apply the bucket seat plus one back seat and a
big trunk formula: One bucket seat plus one back seat equals one back seat.”**

“My Date?” the sophomore exclaims. “What date? Is it Homecoming already? Hey, Frank, you know any more available dates at
the What-A-Burger? Seems like I was just getting here yesterday. It can’t be Homecoming yet. My janitor just showed up
for the first time yesterday.”

And then there is the freshman. Despite combat with the faculty and sophisticated sophomores, he has remembered Homecoming. “Just because
I flunked my PE test,” he says, “doesn’t mean I can’t be as good a date as those foul-mouthed sophomores.
I am going to ask my date if she would like to see the soccer field. If she says yes,
I point her in the right direction and tell her ‘good night’ and go to bed. If I go down
to the soccer field, I might not be able to walk back up to the dorm. Got to rest up
for drill Tuesday.”

There are the special cases. For you who are high...Running the option play.” On returning to Richardson Field for Homecoming,
Smith said, “Both are positive factors. Web Nets First Win - Richmond’s fullback, Larry Zunich, is the best back our
defensive unit has seen.” Coach Homer Smith described the man largely responsible. That is how Head at the hands of
the Spiders. Of the ability of the Press named Zunich damage running wide. He added that he was astounded to
see Zunich, apparently stopped by several tacklers, suddenly burst through the pile and speed to a 69-yard touchdown. “It is
not easy to put a continually strong team together with our small number of boys. We hate to lose. In
fact, we can barely stand it. But nothing has happened to discourage us for our remaining games,” he said.

Caldwell displayed his tremendous kicking ability on the end. October 28, 1966. Page Five. But the bigger one is the
return to Richardson Field after four games away. Also, Homecoming will add a lot of pageantry to the game.” Smith
sees tomorrow's game as a challenge to the team. “The team is doing fine. However, this is a most difficult
time because the boys are badly beaten physically and are facing the toughest game we've played.” The Dirty Thirty lost
another member last weekend. Jeff Pflugner, a defensive end, is out with a knee injury sustained in the Richmond game.
Fullback Kerry Keith and interior lineman Lowell Bryan returned to practice Wednesday and are likely starters in tomorrow's game. Among
the common opponents of the two teams, the Bulldogs have lost to George Washington, which Davidson beat in the first
game of the season. The Citadel overpowered Richmond, which upset Davidson last week. East Carolina defeated both teams, but The
Citadel gave them a tough game until the fourth quarter. Halftime festivities will include a traditional program by the Lenoir
High School Band and the crowning of the Homecoming queen by President D. Grier Martin.

MAX SMACKS BALL. Dr. Max Polley’s efforts were to no avail as the freshmen took the best of the three-game
series. In other action in the freshmen-faculty competition, the freshmen also won the softball game 18-4. With these victories, the
freshmen took a commanding lead in the Freshman-Faculty Games. (Staff Photo by Olson)

Schoolies, we have planned a different technique for you. Pete Glidewell and Bill Foo and Walker each have East Carolina
attendance single game yardage records. Glidewell has caught 35 passes for 332 yards and 6 touchdowns. Taylor and Glidewell lead
the Southern Conference in scoring with 30 points each. Jim Galagan of The Citadel follows them in the department with
27 points.

In praising Zunich’s ability, Smith said that even though the Wildcats contained him well in the second half on his
attempts up the middle, he did great work. Sunday will be depressed. All kinds of plans for Homecoming. Sneaky, gross,
ridiculous. And they will when you finally leave, every one of us whether you were a good date or not.
If you were a good date, the reason is self-explanatory. If you weren’t such a good date, we will still
be sad because Homecoming is gone and on Monday the grind will begin again. This can be the difference.

N. C. State ran past Davidson 8-2 in soccer Tuesday to drop the ‘Cat record for the season to 2-4.
At halftime, the score was 2-1 in favor of State, but three high shots that cleared the outstretched arms of
Davidson goalies Kem Anderson and Harry Hamil paved the way for the second half onslaught. Greg Simmons and George Brown
kicked goals for Davidson. “They had an extremely good center forward who could handle the ball and two fast wings
which gave us trouble all afternoon,” stated Coach Harry Fogleman. He said that a lot of foreign soccer players come
to State to study textiles and bolster their team. Fogleman thought that Davidson deserved a better outcome than the score
indicates. Four starters did not make the trip. Bob Lanier and Bayard Miller were out with injuries and John Flowers
and Willie Edmunds have been lost for the remainder of the season due to academic requirements. Pfeiffer, the best team
in the state last year and one of the top ones this year, plays here on Wednesday. Fogleman says that
they’re not as good as last year, but he expects a tough match. Davidson will be out to put the
skids on a three-game losing streak against Appalachian here today. The game was moved to 2 p.m. to avoid conflict
with the freshman football game at 3:30 p.m.
