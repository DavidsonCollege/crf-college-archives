**Rowdy Students Effect Midnight “Down Pour”**

With the sap rising, final exams approaching, and a full moon guiding them on, a mob of students raided Belk Dormitory Wednesday night in one of the biggest riots on campus in several years. The raid began around midnight when participants in several smaller skirmishes decided to unite against the sophomore dorm. The foray, which was directed principally at Belk’s first floor, was made by more than 100 warriors, mostly freshmen. Bucketfuls of water and rolls of toilet tissue were the main weapons. Consequently, there were no serious injuries.

The raiders, commanded by an affluence of leaders, were dressed in a variety of “uniforms” ranging from London Fog raincoats to knee-length pajamas. Mrs. J. S. Moore, supervisor of dormitories, arrived after 1 a.m. to see the mopping-up process begin. “This is by far the worst (riot) in several years,” Mrs. Moore exclaimed Thursday morning as she stood in the lobby of Belk, which took the brunt of the onslaught. Rolls of toilet tissue were scarce as hens’ teeth in the dorms on Thursday morning. It took a workman most of the day, however, to pick up the shreds of tissue from the lawn in front of Belk. “It looks as if we will have to go back to cheaper toilet tissue,” Mrs. Moore mused as she thought over the situation. (In 1957 Mrs. Moore honored a student petition for better quality tissue.)

Dean of Students Richard C. Burts reserved comment on the matter, only to express concern that such riots can develop into more serious and harmful occurrences. Howard Arbuckle, chairman of the Honor Court, and John Spratt, president of the student body, conferred with Dean Burts and Mrs. Moore on Thursday about the incident. Their chief concern seemed to be about the fireworks that accompanied the excitement, as well as the property damage.

**Five-Year Seventh Grader Spends Four Decades Here**

BY BOB ADAMS
Davidsonian Feature Writer

“Fais bien ce que tu fais; ne fais rien à peu près!” is the motto which meets the eye as the student strides into Chambers 209 for another day of French. Next fall, however, the motto and the diminutive French tricolor may remain, but Dr. A. V. Goldiere will have retired from his professorship in the French Department, and a new personality will move in to extol the grandeur of the Continent. A dedicated scholar at 68, Goldiere will be teaching basic French next year in the Institute for American Universities near the Mediterranean coast of southern France.

It would be unfair, though, to say that he’s bored with the sedate life of this small college community. In fact, the Davidson of today presents a cosmopolitan appearance compared to the town in 1922 when Goldiere first began teaching. At that time, the dusty, unpaved streets and the fire-gutted hulk of the old Chambers Building rendered the Davidson scene more akin to Reconstruction Days than to the Roaring Twenties. Goldiere, however, has held much affection for both the college and the town since he first came to Davidson. He emphasizes that he first came here on a one-year contract and could easily have left had he not liked his surroundings.

A native of Massachusetts, Goldiere was graduated from Dartmouth and was doing graduate work at Yale when he interrupted his studies to begin teaching here. He’s accustomed to interruptions and delays though, especially after laboring five years to advance past the seventh grade. Actually, the man who later went on to win his Master’s and PhD from Yale has an excuse for this “underachieving”: after moving to a rural New Hampshire community, he discovered that the local school had only seven grades, but the law required attendance until a boy reached sixteen. Finally winning a high school diploma and a scholarship to Dartmouth, Goldiere soon found his education delayed by World War I. He served in France with the U.S. Ambulance Service, and at the war's end, he and a companion were selected from their unit to remain in France to study for a year at the University of Caen. This experience influenced Goldiere to shift his academic interest from Latin to French.

Goldiere will teach Spanish in the Davidson summer session as his last duty here before the year in Aix-en-Provence, France. Then he and Mrs. Goldiere will return to Davidson, where Goldiere will attempt to perfect his talent as a pianist and, at the same time, try to recover some neglected rest after a devoted and lengthy teaching career.

**Student Council Retains Power Of Interpretation**

The Student Council voted to retain the power to interpret articles seven and eight of the Student Body Constitution, which deal specifically with the Honor System, Wednesday night. For the third time in as many weeks, the subject dominated the discussion in the unusually long council meeting. Having been put aside during last week's meeting, the issue was taken from the table in this week's session. The motion essentially states that the Honor Court be given the power to interpret articles seven and eight of the Student Body Constitution. The Court technically does not have this power at the present time.

Former president Danny Carrell claimed that the Honor Court was hampered without this power in its trials and could not act fairly in a case. Carrell has been trying to get his idea across to the council for more than two months now. Other members of the council pointed out that the council should have the power to interpret its own constitution. Following a lengthy discussion by both sides, the motion was defeated. Student Body President John Spratt said after the meeting that he felt the entire issue lay in the interpretation of the preamble of the constitution.

In other business, the council voted to retain membership in the National Student Association for the coming year. Before the vote was taken, however, the council discussed whether to allow the student body to decide on the issue. Carrell claimed that an open vote of the student body would be useless. “They don’t know the problem as well as we do,” Carrell stated. Charlie Marshall moved that the Student Council make the choice on NSA membership rather than the student body. The motion passed, and the subsequent motion to retain membership also passed.

**Awards Day Honors Outstanding Cadets**

Scabbard and Blade tapped six juniors into the military honor society during Tuesday's drill on the lower soccer field. Marching to the football stadium, the Corps of Cadets passed in review to honor the outstanding ROTC leaders of 1962-63 during the annual Awards Day ceremony. Inducted into Scabbard and Blade were Tarby Bryant, Duke Burngardner, and William Goodykoontz.

**Ensemble Performs Concert Tomorrow**

The Davidson College Wind Ensemble will give a joint concert with the Concert Band of Woman's College, U.N.C. in the Davidson summer session as his last duty here before the year in Aix-en-Provence, France. Then he and Mrs. Goldiere will return to Davidson, where Goldiere will attempt to perfect his talent as a pianist and, at the same time, try to recover some neglected rest after a devoted and lengthy teaching career.

be a clear violation of the ethics set up by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP),” he said. Goodykoontz said that he had initiated local AAUP action in a desire that the college's action in his resignation be investigated, but that he was bound by the chapter here to make no comment at the present time for publication. He added that the administration's action in accepting his resignation with a mere three weeks left in the semester proved their “indifference” toward his students.

During this week, six members of the faculty circulated a petition calling for support of the administration's decision in the Goodykoontz affair. Dr. J. W. Reid, one of the six, told THE DAVIDSONIAN this morning, “We...contacted full professors, associate professors, and assistant professors. We did not quite see all of them, however. It (the petition) was signed by both a majority of the people contacted and by a majority of the faculty.”

In explaining their motivation, Reid said, “We felt this man—Johnston—was feeling pretty much alone in making this decision. We just wanted to let him and President Martin know of the faculty's support.” Reid explained that the six men, Dr. C. J. Pietenpol, Prof. Bradley D. Thompson, Dr. E. A. Beaty, Dr. Malcolm Lester, Dr. W. G. McGavock, and himself, felt “the majority of the faculty did support the president” and that for that reason they decided to draw up a petition. “We're happy to say that only a very few contacted were unwilling to sign.”

President Martin had these comments today on the action by the faculty: “I was, of course, grateful for this kind of expression. It certainly means a great deal to me to see them express their confidence in this way.” Martin also said that he does not plan to use the petition “in any way” unless the Board of Trustees wishes to bring the matter up. “A sizable majority of the faculty signed it,” he said.

FOR ONLY $3.00 A DAY: NO. 3

When six of you go to Europe during your summer vacation, you will certainly want to visit Spain, where the tall corn grows. The first thing you will notice upon entering Spain is the absence of sibilants. In Spain “s” is pronounced “th” and thereby hangs a tale. Until the reign of Philip IV—or Guy Fawkes, as he was sometimes called—Spaniards said “s” just like everybody else. Philip IV, however, lisped, and Spaniards, having an ingrained sense of propriety and not wishing to embarrass their monarch, decided that everybody should lisp. This did indeed put Philip IV very much at his ease, but in the end it turned out to be a very bad thing for Spain. It wrecked the sassafras industry—Spain’s principal source of revenue—and reduced the nation to a second-class power.

As a result, Spaniards were all forced to turn to bullfighting in order to keep body and soul together. Today, wherever you go in Spain—in Madrid, in Barcelona, in Toledo, in Cleveland—you will see bulls being fought. For many years the bulls have sought to arbitrate this long-standing dispute, but the Spaniards, a proud people who use nothing but Castile soap, have rejected all overtures.

It is therefore necessary for me to explain bullfighting to anyone who is going to Spain. It is also necessary for me to say a few words about Marlboro Cigarettes because they pay me for writing this column, and they are inclined to pout if I ignore their product. In truth, it is no chore for me to sing the praises of Marlboro Cigarettes, for I am one who fairly swoons with delight when I come upon a cigarette which gives you the full, rich taste of good tobaccos plus the pure white Selectrate filter, and Marlboro is the only smoke I have found that fulfills both requirements. Oh, what a piece of work is Marlboro! The flavor reaches you without stint or diminution. You, even as I, will find these statements to be happily true when once you light a Marlboro. Marlboros come to you in soft pack or Flip-Top box, and are made only by the makers of Marlboro.

But I digress. Let us return to bullfighting. Bulls are by nature bellicose creatures who will keep fighting till the cows come home. Then they like to put on pipe and slippers and listen to the “Farm and Home Hour.” However, the Spaniards will not allow the bulls any surcease. They keep attacking the bull and making veronicas—a cornmeal pancake filled with ground meat. Bulls, being vegetarians, reject the veronicas and then, believe you me, the fur starts to fly!

To be perfectly honest, many Spaniards have grown weary of this incessant struggle and have left their homeland. Columbus, for example, took off in three little ships—the Patti, the Maxene, and the Laverne—and discovered Ohio. Magellan later discovered Columbus. Balboa also sailed to the New World, but he was silent on a peak in Darien, so it is difficult to know what he discovered.

Well sir, I guess that’s all you need to know about Spain. So now, as the setting sun casts its rosy fingers over El Greco, let us take our reluctant leave of Spain—or Perfidious Albion, as it is jocularly called. Aloha, Spain or Perfidious Albion, aloha!

# 1963 Max Shulman

Let us not, however, take our leave of smoking pleasure. Let us keep enjoying those fine Marlboro Cigarettes—rich, golden tobacco—pure white Selectrate filter—soft pack or Flip-Top box—available in all fifty States of the Union.
