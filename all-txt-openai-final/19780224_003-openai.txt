**Boon seeks cooperation in program**

To the Editor:

I was interested to see Pam Camera’s article regarding international students and programs in last week’s Davidsonian and I would like to make a few remarks. It was good to see a specific listing of proposals that might lead to improvement of the international student program. I appreciate the awareness Dr. Lois Kemp's comments may have brought to the Davidson student body, and I am also pleased to report that improvements have already been instituted in a number of areas of the foreign student program.

Dr. Kemp made reference to the annual turnover of foreign students, and to the fact that it was difficult for a foreign student to make a full adjustment to Davidson within a year. I can only concur. Native Americans often find it difficult to adjust to Davidson; it is easy to see that foreign students may face more demanding challenges in terms of adaptation. The most achievable improvement we can make in this area, as Dr. Kemp suggests, is providing reliable and useful information that will help a foreign student be as aware as is possible of the environment he will encounter here.

This was a recurring theme that emerged from the meeting with the international students on January 12 and from the Focus on International Students in the January 20, 1978 issue of The Davidsonian. Other suggestions that were noted at our meeting on January 12 dealt with earlier notification of scholarship recipients, jobs for foreign students, academic requirements, housing, and other ways by which foreign students could achieve better integration into the student body. It was felt that an orientation session could help us attain this goal and one has been scheduled to run concurrent with freshman orientation. Some of the activities for the freshmen will be utilized, and others addressing the specific needs of the foreign students will be added.

The dining arrangements for the International Students have also been called into question. On February 8, I...

**Metzel questions College investments**

South Africa today is controlled absolutely by a repressive racist white minority who systematically deny the other four-fifths of the population their basic human rights. Non-whites in that country are not allowed the rights to form political parties, to run for office, to vote, or even to own property. Moreover, the Apartheid system of racial separation prohibits non-whites from acquiring the economic and social resources to escape the perpetual poverty and lack of opportunity in which they now exist. They are limited to employment in the most menial and unskilled jobs, they cannot join labor unions, and they are prohibited from free enterprise above a trivial level.

Because of white South African determination to continue Apartheid despite increasing discontent among Blacks, many analysts predict the inevitability of a violent and bloody race war unless outside pressure is applied soon. A few weeks ago, here at Davidson, Lord Caradon echoed this worry in his call for international intervention to avert total disaster in southern Africa. If indeed this is the case, then a large responsibility rests on the United States, not only because of its leading role in world affairs, but also due to its own substantial interests in South Africa. The current value of U.S. loans to South Africa is about $3 billion, and at least 300 American corporations are active in its economy. Not surprisingly, most of the world has accused the United States of tacitly supporting the Apartheid system due to our considerable stake in the South African economy. Last year, the American veto of a UN attempt to place a total economic embargo on South Africa only seemed to confirm these accusations.

However, American actions are defended by some who argue that the imposition of an economic embargo would only hurt the Blacks by removing the good example of American companies, increasing unemployment, and hardening the present regime’s determination to persist. Yet such men as South African newspaper editor Donald Wood (who recently fled the country) and Steve Biko (who died mysteriously in a South African prison) have forcefully advocated immediate economic sanctions as the only possible hope for change before it is too late.

The question of how to act is complicated, but the seriousness of what will happen if something is not done demands action. Davidson can become involved in the issue at this point, for though it has no direct link to South Africa, it does have influence. Presently the College has over $6 million of its $17 million endowment in 21 corporations and banks which have subsidiaries in South Africa. Through stockholder pressure, or even divestment of its stock, Davidson can exert some influence that might cause these companies to re-examine their activities in South Africa. Admittedly, divestiture would have little direct impact, but such action would demonstrate our concern, would add to a growing grassroots movement for action, and would arouse student, corporate, and even Charlotte community (if properly publicized) consciousness to the seriousness of the South African problem.

One final note—this issue was brought before the finance committee last weekend. They shall be considering possible adoption of a formal statement of social responsibility for Davidson's investment, to be acted on at the next trustee meeting this spring. However, if Davidson is truly concerned about the South Africa issue, it ought to be given specific consideration. This is not likely to happen unless further pressure is applied.

“Hey, sonny, where're ya thinking about going to...?”Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

---

"School next year?” 

“Well,” answered the bright young high school senior, “I was thinking about MIT, UVA, Dartmouth, and Yale, and I finally decided on Davidson.”

“Why's that?” probed the man, attempting to continue the conversation.

The boy thought for a moment, shuffling his feet and looking in the air above the man's head as if the answer were written in the air there. “I gave college a lot of thought,” the boy began, sure of himself, as if he had given this speech a hundred times before. “I decided that I wanted a liberal arts education in a small college with a friendly atmosphere. My education is very important to me and I think that a liberal arts education will better prepare me for life by exposing me to a great many different points of view and give me a sound background from which I can make my own decisions about religion, philosophy, and life in general.”

“And you think that Davidson can give you those things?” asked the man, not wanting to be insulting.

“Yes, I do,” responded the young man. “I understand that Davidson is excellent in all of its fields.”

“I see,” responded the man.

At that point, the student got off the bus and walked down the street to his home, leaving the man to continue his trip alone...

The problem with this story is that Davidson is not a liberal arts college in the sense of the boy's meaning of that term. The term implies a well-rounded course selection that contains representations from all cultures and presents them fairly and without bias. The purpose of such an education is to expose the student to many fields of thought and give him a sound basis for interpreting the meaning and direction of his life.

In light of this definition, it is clear that Davidson is not a liberal arts college. Although it is diverse in its excellence in Natural Sciences, Economics, and Western Culture, it is almost totally bogged down in its preoccupation with Christian morals and ethics. Davidson fails to present a comprehensive or even a representative view of that part of the world that managed to develop without the overriding influence of Christianity, the East. The school's curriculum also manages to nearly ignore a country and philosophy that has had the greatest effect on the U.S. of any country for thirty years, the USSR. In view of these blatant deficiencies, one can scarcely consider Davidson a liberal arts college. It would be better considered a seminary, a western studies center, or a pre-med shop, but definitely not a liberal arts college. Davidson would better meet my requirements for a liberal arts college if it sacrificed some of its depth in western culture courses for more courses which would offer exposure to Soviet and other non-western cultures.

I attended a meeting of the Patterson Court Council, and I raised the question of foreign students dining on the court. Patterson Court houses are uniformly filled to capacity during the fall term, with waiting lists comprised of those who wish to join but were excluded during self-selection. Therefore, there is a strong reluctance to appropriate spaces for foreign students at that time. International Students with whom I spoke also expressed an apprehension at being assigned sight-unseen to one of the houses. The plan we have instituted is to allow the International students the opportunity of visiting the eating houses during the fall term and selecting a house to dine at during the winter and spring.

Dr. Kemp's concern for the emphasis placed upon International Education by the Administration is shared. I will profess a conviction that the position of International Study Coordinator should be full-time. It presently is a half-time position, and in my estimation, full-time efforts are highly desirable if we are to do a thorough and complete job of advising students interested in international opportunities, of managing the foreign student program, and of taking care of administrative work for any of the foreign study program directors who want to utilize the services of our office. A professional with extensive training in the field of international education could probably serve a useful function at Davidson, and the recruitment of a highly qualified and experienced Director of International Education would perhaps be a goal for the future. However, we must deal with the immediate and practical realities of tight budgets and college priorities, and understand that the question must be asked: “How can we currently make the best use of our personnel and facilities with regard to all phases of the operation of the college and its programs?”

I don’t hesitate to admit that I am a little short of experience in international education management, and I am eager to receive input from anyone who wishes to express opinions or make suggestions. I am glad to know of Dr. Kemp's desire to improve the foreign student program, and I am glad to know of her willingness to make efforts that will result in the international students having more fulfilling experiences at Davidson. There are many of us on the staff, faculty, and in the student body who share a belief in the value of international education, and in the value of having foreign students on campus. Cooperation and communication among us all can be very useful tools in building a program of international education that can benefit all members of the Davidson College Community.
