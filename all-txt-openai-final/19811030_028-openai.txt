New coach on the diamond

George Greer brings outstanding background

The Davidson baseball team will have a new face among its members this season. George Greer, eight-year head baseball coach
and athletic director at the University of Connecticut at Avery Point, will take over as skipper of the Wildcats. He
will replace Charlie Slagle, who will remain soccer coach. Slagle was just filling in until such a replacement could be
found.

Quite simply, Greer has got some real credentials to his name. His overall record is 142-52-4, and his teams have
gone 87-7-1 against conference opponents. His teams’ 87 wins have built a UC Avery Point dynasty over the Connecticut Conference,
winning the last eight conference titles.

Greer graduated from the University of Connecticut in 1969, where he was an All-American and Yankee Conference batting champ in
1967 and 1968. After college, he signed with the St. Louis Cardinals and advanced as far as their Triple-A ball
club.

Acting athletic director Ed Farrell was pleased with Greer’s acceptance of the position. “George possesses all the qualities that Davidson
is looking for in a coach. He has knowledge, experience, and genuine concern for the student-athletes who play for him.
We are looking forward to the development of a quality baseball program.”

With Greer as its mentor, the baseball team can hope to improve upon last year’s 18-26 record.
