**U.S. and Canada to face off at Davidson Olympic volleyball storms Johnston Gym Student ticket prices slashed to $3**

By HAP BRYANT

Olympic women’s volleyball teams from the United States and Canada are competing in Johnston Gymnasium tonight at 7:30 p.m. The contest, a brainchild of Charlotte promoter Howard Barnhill, comprises part of a four-match series between the two teams. According to Davidson volleyball coach Rebecca Hawkins, Barnhill chose Davidson’s facility because he was “looking for a small gym that would not have a lot of cost.” Davidson will receive a fee for the use of its gym, but the profits of the match will go to Barnhill’s enterprise and to the teams. As a result, Davidson does not stand to lose if the project fails financially.

Thus far, Hawkins said, ticket sales have been slow. She attributed the lack of interest to the price of tickets, ten dollars in advance for students and adults and six dollars for children. Consequently, Barnhill has agreed to lower prices for Davidson students to three dollars. Hawkins hopes the lower price will spark interest among the student body. The match has been publicized in North Carolina, but because the promoter does not want the added expense of advertisement, the publicity has been limited. Hawkins said that “volleyball people know about it” across the state, but knowledge outside the volleyball circles is slight.

Hawkins hopes that the event will help volleyball at Davidson. She anticipates an exciting match that the crowd will enjoy. “Hopefully, the crowd will be able to see the competition on floor level,” she said. She believes that the match will increase volleyball awareness and interest on campus. She particularly mentioned the growing intramural interest in the sport. By watching Olympic-caliber athletes compete, Hawkins believes that others will realize the difficulty of the sport.

Also, on the heels of a successful volleyball season, Hawkins hopes that the occasion will emphasize the rising program at Davidson. The match will be “very inspirational for current team members and supporters” and “will help in making people aware that we do have volleyball here,” said Hawkins. Hawkins also called the event “something positive we can do” in the face of the recent negative publicity about Davidson athletics.

The United States team, coached by Terry Liskevych, finished seventh at the Seoul Olympics. The team that will play at Davidson is basically the same one that competed in the Olympics. However, several players have retired, and several new players have emerged as contenders for spots on the team. Following the series of matches with Canada, the United States team will host the gold medalists from the Soviet Union beginning March 1. The match at Davidson represents an attempt to bring high-quality athletics to the area in hopes of inspiring local interest in an internationally popular sport.

**Around the Horn**

By HAP BRYANT

“What are you thinking?” “Write something positive.” “When are we going to get some good press?” In the last several weeks, I have received questions like these concerning my last two articles and my conduct in general. This column is not intended as a retraction or a justification; I just want to clear up some issues.

First, the women’s sports article. It was not my intention to belittle women’s athletics, nor did I try to discourage people from attending Davidson. The comment about my sister (not wanting her to attend Davidson) was meant to illustrate graphically how unfair I think the financial contribution to women’s athletics is. Taken out of context, it could influence a recruit’s decision. If one realizes that by now, if not, it’s time to come to grips with reality, folks.

Secondly, the Bobby Hussey article. At this point, the point is probably moot. However, some people, particularly in the athletic department, read my thoughts wrongly and assumed I was attacking Hussey’s character. Believe me, this was not my intention.

Wildcats lose to Hofstra
By LARRY DAGENHART

Monday night, Davidson shot 63 percent from the floor in one of its best performances of the year but still lost to Hofstra 78-71. As of Monday the 13th, the Cats have lost their last 10 of 11 games and are 6-20. I merely tried to show evidence of mistying a record for the most losses ever amassed by a Bobby Hussey-coached team. Granted, game coaching is only a small part of the job. Practices, organization, and recruiting all fit into the picture. Hussey has done rather well in these areas, particularly in getting top prospects to Davidson and in delegating his authority efficiently to his assistant coaches. So, you make your own judgment.

After being up by five at the half, 33-28, Hofstra opened up the second half with a 23-9 run which put the Wildcats down by nine. Despite a career-high 19 points from Magic Gaines, the Wildcats couldn’t put the finishing touches on a comeback which typified Davidson’s disappointing season: a meager crowd at Johnston Gym, no pep band, and a scoreboard that never showed Davidson in the lead. Worse, William and Mary was coming into the game at only 5-18. After being down 26-12 with 11 minutes remaining in the first half, Davidson made its best run of the night as Gray got eight straight points amidst a 10-2 Wildcat streak to cut the Tribe’s lead to 28-24. It looked then as if it would be a ball game. William and Mary led 43-32 at halftime. In the second half, the Cats kept their deficit between 13 and 17 points but the real problem was shooting. While Davidson missed its layups by blowing nine of 23 shots in the paint, William and Mary got hot from 3-point land and hit eight of 11.

“When you can’t get the ball to go down, it’s hard to keep momentum,” said coach Hussey. Freshman Bruce Elder moves the ball. Photo courtesy of Sports Information.

After a late Saturday night game with Baptist, the Wildcats lost to William and Mary 88-69 in a game which, for the most part, typified Davidson’s disappointing season. Davidson travels to Baltimore for a rematch with Maryland-Baltimore County and is back home on the 22nd to take on Miami of Ohio.

DON’T MISS the final game at cozy Johnston Gym on Saturday, February 25 against Central Florida. Tipoff for all home games is 7:30.
