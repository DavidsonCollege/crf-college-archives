**Alumni Begin Preparations For First Varsity Conflict**

By JOE EARLE

Throughout the day, athletic alumni will be trickling into Davidson and begin readying themselves for tomorrow’s grid contest with the
varsity. The alumni will only have one practice session, late this afternoon, in which they will be whipped into shape
to tackle the varsity.

Steve Heckard, executive director of the Wildcat Club, is coordinator for the alumni team and is pleased with the response
so far. This will be the first varsity-alumni game at Davidson, replacing the traditional red-white Spring conflict. The game will
be played at 3 p.m. on Richardson Field. There will be no admission charge.

Heckard expects roughly 54 old-timers to play tomorrow, including only 11 players from last year’s varsity team. Heckard said that
roughly 35 of the 54 would be what he termed “able-bodied.” The coaches for the alumni include Davidson Freshman grid
coach Gene McEver, Bill Story, Croll Little, and Heckard. “Red” Wilson, the head football coach and Athletic Director at Elon
College, will serve as assistant coach.

Heckard expressed confidence in the team. “I feel sure that we can fill every position on the offense with able-bodied
players,” he said, “but we may rely on the varsity to help out with the defensive positions.”

Heckard discussed the return of several offensive stars, citing especially Danny House (’61), who held the all-time Davidson receiving record
until two years ago. Freshman basketball coach Neill McGeachy will also play. The alumni have already incurred their first injury.
Russell B. Walls, professor of psychology here at Davidson, pulled a muscle jumping over a creek while getting in shape
for the contest tomorrow, Heckard said.

The repercussions of the alumni game are intended to last beyond tomorrow afternoon. “The primary purpose of the game is
to have fun,” Heckard said, “but we also hope to help get alumni involved in Davidson. Also, the game will
help the Wildcat Club raise alumni interest. The Wildcat Club raises money through alumni donations to pay for football scholarships.
Working during last year, the Club fell short of their goal for scholarships for 1971, and the trustees agreed last
week to pay the difference. The Club has been raising capital for the 1972 season since January. “We have roughly
$50,000 out of a needed $160,000,” Heckard said, “so we are very pleased.”

The trustees felt that the Club should be allowed a full year of fundraising before any analysis of the program
is instituted. Next fall, they will review the system to determine if the Club’s funds should be supplemented by the
college during the next four years.

**Coaches Sponsor Summer Camps**

Sports WriterIt has been said that a teacher can never tell how far this influence will reach. This summer the
Davidson coaches will set aside their recruiting files and playbooks for a while and turn their attention to young athletes
participating in the Davidson College summer programs. Hundreds of campers, ranging in age from eight to eighteen, will visit the
campus and receive instruction in basketball, tennis, football, and baseball.

The seventh annual Wildcat basketball camp, under the direction of head coach Terry Holland, will offer four week-long sessions. The
camp dates are June 13-19, June 20-26, July 11-17, and July 18-24. The camp is open to boys between eight
and seventeen years old, and will feature instruction in individual offensive skills, development of team skills, and movies for the
application of techniques. Assistant coaches Bo Brickels and Neill McGeachy will aid Holland, as well as several members of the
team and other college players.

Tennis coach Harry Fogleman will direct the second annual camp for netters between the ages of nine and eighteen. Both
boys and girls may attend the camp, which offers two sessions from June 19-26 and June 27-July 3. In addition
to this camp, Fogleman will also conduct a special program for players with either sectional or national ranking June 7-12.
Following that session, Davidson will host the thirty-ninth annual Southern Juniors and Boys Championships from June 14-19.

Head football coach Dave Fagg will skipper the third annual National Junior Football Federation camp for boys eight to fifteen
July 25-30. The session occurs a week prior to the NJFF season, and affords the campers an opportunity to go
through preseason conditioning and gain a competitive edge for their respective teams. Fagg will employ his assistants Evans Brown, Will
Campagna, Bob Mosketti, and Wildcat Club director Steve Heckard in lectures, chalk talks, and drills in football fundamentals. Head coach
Donald E. Fuoss of Middle Tennessee State University will conduct clinics at the camp, with particular emphasis on preseason conditioning.

Boys eight to sixteen will participate in the second annual baseball camp, directed by coach Tom Stevens. The dates of
the camp are June 27-July 3, and other college and high school coaches will assist Stevens in providing individual instruction
on all phases of the game.
