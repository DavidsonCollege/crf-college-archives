### The Mystery of the Stalled Handbook

Content in the belief that he can smooth the feelings of the college secretaries and make them lie back in abashment, Director of Personnel Robert Stephenson has continued to stall in his efforts to come up with an employment handbook for the hourly-paid staff. This handbook is something the secretaries have been wanting for around a year now. Organizing a group called the Chambermaids, these secretaries have even offered to work after hours with no pay to write a handbook. All they request is a statement of employee rights pertaining to hiring and firing, salary increases, and promotions. They have to this point been effectively denied this request by Stephenson's office, which has yet to complete work on any aspect of the document.

First using the excuse that he was unaware of the need, then the excuse that he needed help to compile the handbook, Stephenson has allowed all of the deadlines for completion of the handbook to come and go. Alerted to the problem last spring, Stephenson did no work in planning the booklet that summer. On September 26, he claimed that he was unable to begin the work because he had no help. At this time he claimed that he was in the process of hiring someone specifically to help work on the document. College President Samuel R. Spencer Jr. said at this time that he had given permission to hire such a person. Stephenson said that work would begin on November 24 and be completed on March 8. On January 13, Stephenson went back on his statement of September 26 and said that he had just been given permission to hire a helper, blatantly contradicting his earlier promise.

As it turns out, all of the caviling was apparently a cover-up. A number of secretaries said they would help with the booklet during off hours. Today is March 12, four days after Stephenson’s own deadline. As the cliché goes, he has run out of excuses. Why has nothing been done? Apparently, Stephenson and the administration do not want the secretaries and other hourly-paid employees to have a statement of rights. They want to continue to operate on a system of arbitrary reward, arbitrary promotion, and arbitrary firing. Davidson secretaries are apparently not going to get their handbook and with it their rights. Their reason is simple. As long as the secretaries continue to lie down for Stephenson and the College, there is no benefit for Stephenson and the College in bringing out a booklet of rights.

We call for the secretaries to reach an agreement to take affirmative action at the meeting on Tuesday. A mild protest, such as not coming to work one day, is not out of the question. It seems that nothing the secretaries do will top the antics of the Personnel Office that have already been perpetrated.

### Compromised Bill of Rights Ignores Essential Freedoms

By Mark Wilensky  
Staff Writer

On February 17, former SGA President John Munce presented Draft Twelve of the Statement of Student...Rights and Responsibilities to students, faculty, staff, and trustees. Many students have forgotten the history of the Statement. Two years ago, Blain Butner and his senate drafted an SGA Constitution along with a Statement of Student Rights. No new ground was broken in the annals of student liberties. Most schools had had such statements for years; many had stronger ones. The Statement was a new one for Davidson. Davidson College has always insisted that such a Statement was unnecessary. The College pleaded that since it was benevolent and wise, student rights were insured. As was seen in two acts of censorship in 1974 and numerous administrative decisions, that insurance was not full coverage. Thus, Butner would not be appeased. The documents passed a student referendum, were accepted for information by the faculty but rejected by the trustees. The problem was basically the media section of the Statement of Student Rights. The Statement provided for full freedom of expression and student press; First Amendment freedoms guaranteed to all Americans. Rejected by Davidson College. As is their practice, the trustees called for a joint committee of students, faculty, and trustees. They appointed Walter Lingle Chairman. Lingle promptly closed all meetings, issued a gag order, and decreed all votes would be unanimous. These provisions kept the committee from moving with any speed; in fact, they are still meeting. The basic issue is simple. The College feels all student publications reflect on the College’s reputation. Thus they cannot agree to a “free” press: lest penises and the word “fuck” taint Davidson’s image with the public. Somehow the image of repression of free speech is not one they’re afraid of. John Munce, Bo Baskin, Peyton Marshall, and Blain Butner in various combinations have bargained for the students. They have bargained in good faith because they believe the committee and its charge have merit. The College has yet to bargain. Through legal counsel, they have clouded the issue, claiming title as publisher, and insisting, through the same counsel, that there is no legal way to avoid liability as publisher short of sending student publications off campus. There is the question as to who is the publisher. One school of thought insists the College is, because they collect the funds. The other says that within the same collection system the College can remove itself as publisher. College Counsel supports the first position. He’s paid a lot of money to do so. The students refuse to fight the interpretation. Regardless of form, this College is not about to give away its right to censor publications. Despite their switch to legalese and the “publisher theory,” we clearly recall that when Sam Spencer and Will Terry censored “Quips and Cranks” they explained that at the bottom line: “the College can never allow the publication of material that is harmful to its image.” Where does this leave the students? Bo Baskin is pledged to agreement at all costs. He cannot afford to be a Butner or Munce. Munce and Butner graduated with no accomplishments. Baskin wants an agreement. He will agree in some form sooner or later. Since the College has shown no signs of changing or modifying its position, the only agreement Baskin will get is one compromising student First Amendment rights. In some form, the College will retain the ultimate right to censor publications. Students have only one option. No one ever gave the SGA the charge to negotiate the Statement passed in 1974's referendum. Thus, a new agreement will have to go before the students for a vote. If rejected, the original statement could be proclaimed (as some activists have pleaded for from the start) under the theory that the Statement affirms Constitution-guaranteed rights. For some time things would roll along smoothly. Then someone will want to print penises or “fuck.” If at that time the SGA President is a tool of the students rather than one bent on appeasement at all costs, Sudge McMillan or his successor will make a binding decision.
