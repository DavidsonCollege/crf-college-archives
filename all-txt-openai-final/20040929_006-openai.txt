**Advice to fellow freshmen: because you haven’t gotten enough of it already**

Go bonkers. I brooded over possible phrases for a while, and in the end, this one won. There’s really no
other option. I found myself—in the first three weeks of college—bogged down by homework. Of course, I feel it my
Davidsonian duty to proclaim myself a nerd and proclaim my love for academia, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. But no matter how
much we love our classes (blah, blah, blah...), we must come to accept the fact that time for silliness must
be allotted. I had been repressing this desire for quite some time. I’m supposed to be serious here, focused. I
kept telling myself this.

The past month or so, we have been reluctantly exposed to gobs of advice—I took the wise recommendation not to
rape my friends into serious consideration, and I seriously hope the rest of our class did. But no counsel exceeds
the impact that a certain professor’s words had on me a couple of weeks ago at a poetry reading. As
the ever-increasing, never-decelerating to-do list jumbled up thoughts inside my head, he told me: “We didn’t bring you here to
be logical.”

Before I could officially become a Davidson student, I was forced to display a poster that proclaimed proudly: “I used
to make A’s!” and surrender a smile for what I’m sure will be a painfully meaningful photograph. Needless to say,
I’m pleasantly distracted from my schoolwork to write this in the wee hours of the morning. That’s a strange sort
of giggle-snorting going on a few doors down; I’ve come to expect this and actually feel quite empty in its
absence. So abandon the books at 1 a.m. for a Waffle House run. Stay up three hours later talking about
the philosophy of time-travel with your newfound friends, kindle the creativity inside of you regardless of the massive amount of
chemistry homework you have. It doesn’t have to make sense.

**A fan’s farewell to Christian ska band**

By Michael Cavell

Five Iron Frenzy is by far the greatest band ever—or at least they were until they broke up. I am
a self-described hardcore Five Iron Frenzy fan. As a devoted listener since middle school, I have often been perplexed by
the flat-out weirdness of some of their songs, but somehow I find myself continuously drawn back to their music—it’s as
if their lack of appeal is endearing. Don’t get me wrong—Five Iron Frenzy has written some great serious songs, but
the rest of their song list reads like a greatest hits of Weird Al. From singing about pants, mullets, Canada,
and getting hit by cars in the street and then making mashed potatoes, there is no end to the silliness
of this band.

Nonetheless, I will admit that Five Iron, as fans call them, was a source of inspiration for me during middle
school. As a saxophone player, being exposed to the music of Five Iron inspired me to think that I too
could make it as a rock and roll superstar in a sweet ska band. In fact, if you would have
asked me in seventh grade what I wanted to do when I grew up, I would have told you in
all seriousness, “Dude, I want to be a rock star saxophone player, like in a ska band or something.” Obviously,
things change, and along with my career aspirations, things have changed drastically for Five Iron Frenzy with the most prominent
change being that as a band, they no longer exist. Within the past year, one of the greatest bands of
Christian rock has thrown in the towel and disbanded. Finishing up their farewell tour in 2003 and releasing their farewell
CD, “The End is Near,” sold at Five Iron concerts first in June of 2003 and in stores in 2004,
their...Passing has been mourned by myself and other fervent fans. Rivaled by only the O.C. Supertones as the kings of
the expansive Christian ska world, Five Iron was loved and revered by many in the Christian rock community. In this
article, I will attempt to convey the singular greatness of this band.

Five Iron released their first CD in the spring of 1996, an independent release entitled “It’s Funny But Not Very
Creative.” I never heard this CD, but based on the facts that it was recorded in two days and only
sold five hundred copies, I assume that it was pretty terrible. Five Iron’s first recording for Five Minute Walk Records,
the label they would spend almost their entire career on, was “Upbeats and Beatdowns” recorded in November of 1996. I
have also never listened to much of this CD, but the band’s opinion of it as posted on their website
reads, “15 songs of cosmic vomit.” That most likely means Five Iron does not think very much of this CD.

Five Iron’s first big hit was “Our Newest Album Ever,” released November 11, 1997. This came out around the time
of sixth or seventh grade for me, and back then, for me and all the other kids in my church’s
youth group, it was the best thing ever. Consisting of encouraging and upbeat tunes “Suckerpunch” and “Every New Day,” hilarious
classics “Blue Comb ’78,” “Oh, Canada,” and “Where is Micah,” and staple tongue-in-cheek Five Iron tunes “Superpowers” and “Handbook for
the Sellout,” the release of this CD represents a high point for the band. All of the elements that make
Five Iron Frenzy great can be found on this CD.

Five Iron Frenzy’s next big CD was “Quantity is Job 1.” Released in 1998, this CD is hilarious. This CD
not only contains the great song, “Untimely Death of Brad,” which tells the story of an unfortunate trumpet player, but
also features “When I Go Out” and the fabled “These are not My Pants Rock Opera.” Remember when I mentioned
weird Five Iron tunes earlier? These are some prime examples. “These are not My Pants” goes through eight different genres
of music ranging from Heavy Metal to Salsa singing about a pair of pants whose owner remains unknown. “These are
not My Pants” is always good for a laugh and the country version is hilarious.

Five Iron’s first live CD came out in 1999. Entitled “Proof that the Youth are Revolting,” this CD is my
favorite. Combining well-done live versions of old “classics” and new songs, funny dialogue from the band, and great interaction with
the crowd, this CD sticks with the established norm that live CDs are almost always better than studio recordings.

Between “Proof that the Youth are Revolting” and “The End is Near,” Five Iron came out with “All the Hype
that Money Can Buy” (2000), “Five Iron Frenzy 2: Electric Boogaloo” (2001), and “Cheeses of Nazareth” (2003). The best song
off of “All the Hype That Money Can Buy” is “Phantom Mullet.” If you are a fan of the movie
“Joe Dirt” like me, this song is for you.

Five Iron Frenzy’s farewell CD, “The End is Near,” is a great two-disc set. One CD is live and the
other is from the studio and contains mostly new material. The studio CD contains a lot of good tunes, with
“Wizard Needs Food, Badly” being my personal favorite. The live CD is also well done, with a good variety of
old favorites and newer songs.

Even with Five Iron Frenzy officially disbanded, I still often find myself listening to their CDs. As one of the
most creative recorded bands ever lyrically, they deserve to be heard, even though they are just a little bit on
the weird side.
