THE DAVIDSONIAN - BACKPAGE INTERVIEW, MONDAY, APRIL 10, 1995

MEADOWS & SCHENKAR

Playwright Insights

Karen Jones Meadows and Joan Schenkar voice their opinions and attitudes toward writing and the role of the female playwright.
March 24, 1995

Because I was unable to arrange a dual interview with both of these playwrights, I asked both writers the same
set of questions when I interviewed them individually. This gave each of the playwrights a chance to express their opinions
and knowledge openly with interesting and surprisingly diverse responses.

**Why do you write and why, in particular, did you pick playwriting as your medium of expression?**

**Schenkar:** Easy answers: I can’t help myself, and I didn’t pick it — it picked me. I was in graduate
school, and the papers I was writing started to develop huge metaphors. I began to write almost as though I
was speaking as characters. When I was in graduate school, I was living in the Chelsea Hotel in New York
City. It’s a sort of famous artist hotel. I think I wrote the only master’s thesis written in the Chelsea
Hotel. I was bribed by my father to go live in Vermont, and it was the only bribe I ever
took — he wanted me out of the Chelsea. I went to Vermont (which is a lonely place), and I
began talking to myself. I began to write those conversations down, and suddenly I was writing plays. It was the
most organic thing that’s ever happened to me.

**Jones Meadows:** I can’t help but write. I mean, really, I can’t. I did really irrational things in terms of
life and lifestyle in order to write. I write primarily because I think there is a need and what I
have to say is important. As for choosing to write plays, it happened naturally. I loved theater, and I was
introduced to theater at a young age... I’ve always liked the spontaneity and human contact of theater. It’s both personal
and immediate — where film is removed. You eat your popcorn and do all kinds of stuff while you are
watching a film. You get into a play. It has much more power, and you really become in love with
the characters, because that removed feeling isn’t there.

**To what extent does being a female influence how you write and what you choose to write about?**

**Schenkar:** Totally. I think that’s the answer to that. Totally.

**In what ways?**

**Schenkar:** Totally. You're not going to get any more out of me than that. Totally. That’s the most complete answer
I can give. Completely. As a playwright, I have to be able to put my mind into any gender. I
have to write as a man. I have to write as a woman. I have to write as a chair
if I’m into heavily propped plays. I’m always influenced by the body I’m in, and I’m totally aware of my
body. So, what you get from me will be from that body’s shape and the way it feels.

**Jones Meadows:** I don’t know. I’ve always been commended by men that I write great men. My characters come and
sit down and say, “I’m your new subject. I’m your new player.” Sometimes they’ve been men. In fact, the first
several [plays] were male-heavy. I think [gender] matters. It’s interesting because the older I get, the more gender and race
matter. They used to be less significant. I don’t know whether I was too naive to see certain things, or
they weren’t there, or it wasn’t my primary purpose. I think the country has changed and people are all squaring
off into corners. I still believe that we don’t have to have corners. I try to write characters who are
universal in their actions and their beliefs. Let the issue be the problem, not a given set of qualities that
you have no control over.

**How do you go about choosing a certain style when you decide to start writing a play?**

**Schenkar:** I didn’t pick it. You have it inside you... I love language. I’m like a dolphin in deep water
in language. My plays are always highly linguistic. Even though each play is set in a different vernacular and often
in a different accent, they are absolutely recognizable.

Karen Jones Meadows and Joan Schenkar, multi-talented individuals.

Rob Kosicki

Karen Jones Meadows, the visiting McGeeProfessor of Writing, is a multi-talented individual who is not only a playwright but also
a performer and producer. Presently, she is teaching the playwriting and screenplay writing classes for the Davidson College English Department.
Being an extremely active playwright and screenplay writer, she is experienced in both the theory of modern theater and film,
and the practical aspects of today’s theater. Harriet’s Return, her one-character play based on the life of the female abolitionist
Harriet Tubman, is playing at the Crossroads Theater in New Jersey, the foremost African-American theater in the country. She has
written productions that have been on Comedy Central and Fox Television. Her current project is a screenplay which explores the
darker, more violent sides of human nature.

Joan Schenkar has had her work produced in experimental theaters in North America, England, and Western Europe. She has won
numerous awards, fellowships, and grants for her writing. Her play Universal Wolf, a “vicious” deconstruction of Little Red Riding Hood,
had its regional premiere under the direction of Professor Joe Gardner in the Davidson College Studio Theater. She has directed
five of her own plays and has gone throughout the United States speaking at college and theater conferences. When she
made her visit to Davidson, she spoke about the significance of the audience member’s relationship with theater. Both her distinct
style and unusual demeanor added to the whole experience of her presentation and reflected the comic quirkiness of her plays.

You can tell when a play has been written by Joan Schenkar, and that is because I have a certain
attitude toward the work and a certain style in my genes. I believe it’s genetic. In fact, I can’t write
a play until I’ve found the style and form. Style is far more important than substance despite everything people have
told you. You can always judge a book by its cover.

Jones Meadows: My plays are all different. I always have some sort of spiritual being in there, no doubt. I
think it is always an experience for me. My first challenge was, “Can I write a play?” So, I wrote
a play. Next, it was, “Can I write a play with seven characters and have them interact?” and then, “Can
I write a play with two characters and not have them bore the audience to death?” I just came out
of a one-woman play which I think was the hardest thing. It’s the play that I love the most. It
was the most difficult to write, but I think it’s got the most experimental style. I don’t like “experimental theater”
particularly. I find a lot of shock value in it, and that’s not what I’m interested in. I’m not against
commercial theater. I think commercial means appealing to the masses of people. You want to write so that two million
people will be affected by it, and you want to write to create a wholeness and a sense of belonging
in a community; if only for 20 minutes. I think it is important for artists not to become elitist and
say, “I’m an artist, and most people don’t understand me because I’m so deep.” I experiment with the psychology of
people. I’m willing to talk about and write about characters who delve into deeper aspects of themselves than we are
comfortable with.

What makes your work unique? How is your work a reflection of you?

Schenkar: I write, specifically, comedies of menace. Usually, I deal with subjects that are so dangerous and painful that they
can only be accessed by laughter. In fact, on a good night, I can make people laugh at things that
are so horrible they could have no other response but to go nuts. I also think that the kind of
comedy I write is rather special. The kind of comedy I write is more like tragedy viewed at a distance.

Jones Meadows: I think it’s that I decided early on that I did not live right. There was something in
life that was missing. So, I started exploring different religions, spiritualities, meditations, and astrology and kinds of things that inform
life at a level that we are not conscious of. That’s in the plays. That’s the Karen hand in there.
If we just deal with physical, mental, and emotional things, our intuition and other things that guide us every day
are missing.
