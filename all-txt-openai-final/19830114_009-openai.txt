### O & C Election Postponed

By TIM MCGAUGHEY ’83

The Student Government Association Senate voted unanimously to reschedule elections for the Quips and Cranks Editor until the fourth Tuesday of Spring Term.

Mark Oldenburg, Chancellor of the SGA, said that the SGA by-laws have been amended to provide for a spring election for the yearbook editor. Filing date for candidates is the third Tuesday of spring and the election will follow the next week. This student election will coincide with SGA elections for President and Vice-president.

Yearbook Editor Jim Reese went before the Media Board and requested the change. The postponement is necessary to better fit their year-long schedule. This change postpones editor elections until after certain yearbook deadlines have passed. Thus, students will have greater opportunity to judge the efforts of those candidates for Quips and Cranks editor.

### Wildcat Handbook

Frances Palmer and Lindsey Rader, running unopposed for the office on a joint ticket, will edit the Wildcat Handbook. The Wildcat Handbook, a publication for incoming freshmen, is sent out in the summer to give newcomers a glimpse of the “Davidson Experience” they will face in the fall. “A lot of people who come here [to Davidson] have never seen the school,” said Frances. “The Handbook is a way for them to sort of learn their way around.”

Frances and Lindsey hope they can make their project a successful one. “The format will be a lot like it was in years past but we think we’ve got some different and creative ideas that we can work with... I hope it won’t just look like all the past issues but with different pictures,” said Frances.

Williams and Cauley are the only candidates running for the position. Cauley is the current editor of The Davidsonian. Williams is responsible for the literary supplement and works on Hobart Park. She was editor of her high school literary magazine and co-editor of the yearbook.

The Miscellany, a national literary magazine, contains the works of professional writers.

### Now we can detect a breast cancer smaller than this dot.

At such an early stage, your chances of living a long, healthy life are excellent. But we need your help. The only proven way to detect a cancer this small is with a mammogram. A mammogram is a low-radiation x-ray of the breast capable of detecting a cancer long before a lump can be felt. If you're over 50, a mammogram is recommended every year. If you're between 40 and 50, or have a family history of breast cancer, consult your doctor. In addition, of course, continue your regular self-examinations.

Circa 1860 Davidson College commissioned J.W. Orr, a New York engraver, to make a woodcut of the first Chambers building. Although Orr’s original has been lost, a few pieces of stationery on which the woodcut adorned the letterhead have been preserved. This facsimile of the Orr letterhead was made from a letter written by J.M. Potts on 1 August 1863. Louis Orr, a descendant of J.W. Orr, made the contemporary series of etchings of North Carolina scenes that hang on the main floor of the E.H. Little Library.
