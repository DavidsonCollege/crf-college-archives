THE DAVIDSONIAN, MAY 22, 1930:

Pickups and Passes
By W. H. Matthews

Football Again

With the last baseball uniform turned in, and school nearly out for this year, interest is being turned toward football prospects for next year. It is barely over three months now before 40 or 50 young Wildcats will be reporting to Monk and Tex for the first fall practices, and soon after that, the first game. Football attracts more interest than all the other sports put together, and we are glad to see it just around the corner.

That Finale

The final baseball game of the season against Duke turned out to be a great disappointment, both as to the quality of ball displayed, and as to the score. Kugler turned in the best game of his career, only to have his efforts wasted because of poor support. The frequent errors of the Davidson infield looked all the worse in the light of the sparkling plays of Duke, whose infield has gone up to the majors almost to a man. Kugler allowed only six hits, two of them of the scratch variety, and kept them so well scattered that not more than two came in any one inning. A look at the score book shows only two earned runs for the Blue Devils. Instead of being a comparatively easy shut-out, the game should have been one of the best pitchers’ duels staged this year. Kugler has succeeded in holding the hard-hitting Blue Devils to fewer safe blows than the majority of hurlers they have encountered, batting mark against the Davidson Captain was .171 for the two games. As a team, they have been hitting well above the .300 mark. Kugler’s last two appearances against them form a fitting close to his college baseball career.

Letters for Golfers

We believe that more recognition should be given the members of the golf team in the awarding of letters than they receive at present. Under the present system, a man must be a member of the team for three years before he receives his monogram in the sport. Should not the sport be put on the same basis as tennis? A case in point: Capt. Jack Pepper led his team through the past season, playing consistently good golf, and closing the year by winning the state individual championship in the tournament at Sedgefield. His play last year was equally as good, and he won second in the state tournament then. Yet he will not receive his letter until next spring. Golf and tennis are games of a somewhat similar nature, each requiring a consummate amount of skill to play successfully. Both are practically on a par here at Davidson, both in the grade of play shown by the members of the respective teams, and in the number of men interested.

Gridiron Prospects Are Bright as Season Nears

Team to be Unusually Strong in Reserve Material—Several Freshmen Look Promising

In the fall a college man’s fancy turns to football, in spite of all that educators can do. And since the time for the annual turning out is only a little over three months away, we present here briefly a survey of Davidson's prospects on the gridiron next fall. It is only an opinion, and subject to a great many “ifs.” Nevertheless, no matter how it is looked upon, next year seems to be the brightest from this point than any Davidson team has had in quite a while.

Sixteen letters and one service monogram were given at the end of the football season last November. Of these seventeen men—eleven linemen and six backs—eleven will report to Monk Younger when he issues his first call early in September. Those who will be lost by graduation are Borneo Baker, tackle; A. L. DeCamp and Lad Mills, guards; and Red Parrish, Tom Brohard, and Murray Christian, backs. The most severe loss will be in the backfield, and in the center of the line.

To balance this loss, there is a rather strong team of freshmen coming up. Sophomore material is always green, but they often make up in fight what they lack in experience. The fact that five of the regulars of last year’s eleven were playing their first year of varsity football shows that these green men can be developed into promising material.

Coming down to positions, we will start in on the ends. It is here Coach Tilson is going to have his least trouble. Three lettermen—Brock, Steve Brown, and Jim Proctor—will (Continued on page 4)in them. We are not advancing a change in the system of awarding the tennis monograms. But we would like to see golf placed on the same footing, that is, the members of the team receiving a minor sports letter each year that their play justifies it, and freshmen receiving numerals. The change is bound to be made sooner or later. With three or four good freshmen coming up to become members of the varsity next year, prospects are better than ever. Why not raise the status of golf now?

Five Contestants Pass Sigma Delta Psi Tests

Five men have qualified in the recent competition and are now eligible to become members of Sigma Delta Psi, national athletic fraternity, according to Capt. N. G. Pritchett, athletic director. Those men qualifying are: A. H. Whittle, captain of the 1930 track squad; Joe McCall, captain-elect of the 1931 track squad; R. F. Norton, sophomore letterman in track; R. E. C. Roane, all-around athlete, but who has not made his letter in any sport, and Thad Brock, captain of the 1929 football team, and who qualified for the honor last year. Joe McCall is leading a large field with 495 points to his credit, and has practically sewed up the trophy, as there is only one more event to be run off, the swimming competition. Several athletes have passed nearly all of the requirements for membership in the fraternity, but still lack four or five events before being able to be initiated. Among these is Tom Brohard, a senior and a member of this year’s football team. Brohard, in the football punt, kicked the pigskin 53 yards.

IF YOU MADE up your mind to produce the best cigarette ever smoked... wouldn’t you begin by selecting the choicest tobaccos in all the world? Wouldn’t you spend time and money without stint to discover and develop the one most perfect blend? ... Of course you would. And that’s exactly what Camel did. That's why Camel so quickly became the most popular cigarette in America. That’s why, no matter what you pay, you can’t match it for mild, mellow fragrance and that smooth richness that makes the perfect smoke. ... Experienced smokers will tell you... It’s a great cigarette! Don’t deny yourself the luxury of Camels. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, Winston-Salem, N. C.
