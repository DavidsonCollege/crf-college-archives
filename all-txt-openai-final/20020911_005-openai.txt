Springsteen draws on 9/11
E Street Band’s talent carries the Boss’s uplifting lyrics
By Curtis SCHMADER

Listening to The Rising, you can imagine a despondent Bruce Springsteen wandering into a church last Sept. 11, feeling overwhelmed
and searching for answers like the rest of us, when lo and behold! There stands James Brown at the pulpit,
testifying to the Lord as his backing band builds to a frenzy behind him. Bruce stands there in awe, and
as the music reaches its boiling point, the Godfather of Soul points at him and demands, “Do you see the
light?” A beam of blue radiance shoots through a stained glass window and illuminates Bruce, and just like John Belushi
in The Blues Brothers, the Boss has a revelation: “THE BAND!” From there he embarks on his own mission from
God, getting the E Street Band back together so he can release The Rising and show Americans the way to
salvation.

No matter how Bruce Springsteen arrived at the decision to reassemble the E Street Band, he should thank his lucky
stars that he did, because their musicianship carries this album, plain and simple. After not playing together in the studio
for nearly twenty years, members of the band cohere on record as if they’ve never spent a day apart. Drummer
Max Weinberg gives the album its driving pulse from the get-go, and as guitar-slingers Springsteen, Steven Van Zandt, and Nils
Lofgren plow through the pitch-perfect chord progressions of rockers like “Waitin’ On a Sunny Day” and “The Rising,” the sound
of an indivisible musical unit emerges, with players so in touch with one another that their guitars outdo the songs’
lyrics in communicating the ideas of dogged hope and unity in the face of despair. Elsewhere, Roy Bittan and Danny
Federici’s keyboards flesh out the atmospherics of the down tempo “Nothing Man” and the powerful, desolate “Paradise.”

In general, the tunes and song structures on this album are quite conservative, creatively mining the classic Springsteen sound rather
than updating it, and Springsteen’s songwriting proves worthy of his band throughout, with the exceptions of the bland mid-tempo balladry
of “Let’s Be Friends [Skin to Skin]” and the not-urgent-enough gospel of “My City of Ruins.” Suffice it to say
that musically, The Rising is first-rate.

In many cases, consistently first-rate music will turn an album’s lyrics into either A) an afterthought if they’re lame or
B) an added bonus if they’re not. That said, I cannot stress enough that this rule does not apply to
The Rising. Anyone who has heard of this album probably knows that its lyrics concern the aftermath of the attack
mounted against the United States last Sept. 11. Coming from any other popular musician of Springsteen’s stature, such a move
might be viewed as part-noble gesture, part-crass exploitation (just imagine corporate entities such as Madonna or U2 releasing a Sept.
11-themed album). Yet so far, The Rising has inspired widespread belief that Bruce Springsteen has, in fact, done justice to
an event of such political and historical enormity. After all, the Boss is a cultural icon; he seems so quintessentially
American that it’s no wonder that his attempt to make sense of last year’s catastrophe has met with loads of
enthusiasm and reverence.

Adulation aside, do the lyrics of the album deliver what hype has promised? Not for anyone expecting a subtle exploration
of the complicated national response to last September’s attacks. As the lyrics of The Rising unfold, Springsteen rarely deviates from
portraying hope in the midst of grief, most often with the help of loaded-but-vague images (of the sky, blood, and—of
all things—tongues), as well as big concepts like love, faith, and God. Lines such as “I see you Mary in
the garden/ In the garden of a thousand sighs/ There’s holy pictures of our children/ Dancin’ in a sky filled
with light” leave the listener stranded in a realm of hazy spiritual uplift, removed from the kind of heart-rending detail
that gains more emotional resonance with each listen. Compare the above lyric with the following, from Springsteen’s “The River”: “Then
I got Mary pregnant, and man, that was all she wrote/ And for my nineteenth birthday I got a union
card and a wedding coat.” Nowhere in the lyrics of The Rising will you find such a desperate and powerful
couplet. Desperate and powerful, yes, but also disturbing—the narrator of “The River” is only nineteen.For crying out loud, and his
life is practically over. *The Rising* offers nothing so unsettling; instead, it seeks only to provide solace, and though it
remains to be seen whether it will endure as one of the great rock ’n’ roll documents of the age,
this album will certainly provide comfort for the many Americans likely to buy it over the next few weeks. For
those of us who wish to commemorate the first anniversary of Sept. 11 by suspending criticism in remembrance of the
short period of perfect national unity that followed the attacks, Bruce Springsteen will be there to prod us toward higher
ground. But after a while, his well-meant platitudes will not be enough to do justice to the changes our nation
has gone through in the past year. *The Rising* hasn’t left my stereo yet, but it will—and whatever it ends
up meaning to me down the road, I can at least thank the Boss for getting the band back together
one more time.

### Charlie Hunter, Guster shine at John Mayer concert

**Despite talent, Mayer seems uncomfortable on stage**

By Matt Whited, Photography Editor

On Monday night at 7:30 when the floor of Belk Arena began to fill with people, it was clear that
this year’s performance by John Mayer and Guster would prove to be an appropriate follow-up to the Counting Crows concert
last fall. By the time Charlie Hunter’s quintet came onstage, the floor and entire lower section of seating were nearly
full, once again proving to any skeptics that Davidson can successfully host a large concert.

Charlie Hunter, who has been opening for Mayer and Guster on this last leg of the tour, began the evening
with a selection of original modern jazz tunes. His quintet featured an unusual combination of instruments for a jazz performance,
however: drums, tenor saxophone, trombone, chromatic harmonica, and 8-string guitar. Since there was no vocalist, the performance was filled with
solos by the instrumentalists, who had ample opportunity to demonstrate their virtuosity. Charlie Hunter’s mastery of the 8-string guitar was
particularly impressive, since the extra strings allowed him to play a bass line at the same time as his rhythm
guitar part. Although Davidson certainly does not have much of a jazz following, it was clear that many of those
in attendance were struck by the talent of Hunter’s group. John Mayer has said before that he admires Charlie Hunter
as a musician, and Hunter proved throughout his four songs that the admiration is well-deserved.

After a short intermission, the three members of Guster came out to resounding applause. Although Guster has received significantly less
media attention than John Mayer, it was immediately clear that many in attendance were familiar with all of Guster’s songs.
Guster performed most of the songs from their 1999 album *Lost and Gone Forever*, which consisted of a mix of
acoustic and electric guitar work by guitarists and vocalists Adam Gardner and Ryan Miller. Possibly the most entertaining part of
Guster’s performance was the tremendously athletic percussion work by Brian Rosenworcel, who played his bongos, snare, and even cymbals with
his bare hands. It was clear that Guster has had lots of time to perform and polish the songs from
*Lost and Gone Forever*, because the band had an incredibly tight sound and obviously worked well together on stage. Guster’s
hour-long set moved very quickly with no down time, and set a high standard that even John Mayer’s headlining band
would not be able to reach.

Whereas Guster had come out to loud applause from the audience, John Mayer came out to screams similar to those
shown on TV from when the Beatles used to enter a performing hall. It was obvious that many in attendance
were not only familiar with Mayer, but knew all of his songs word for word. Mayer began by playing “83”
and “No Such Thing,” two of his best-known songs. Throughout the set he continued to play many of the songs
that have made him popular, including several from his recent release, *Room for Squares*.

John Mayer plays the keyboard at Monday’s successful concert. Reviewer Matt Whited says that Mayer’s unique sound was partially drowned
out by his band. Mayer displayed his amazing talent on the guitar at several points during the set, most notably
during the jams on “Neon” and “Covered in Rain,” both of which included long, impressive solos. However, as good of
