Town of Davidson receives “Smart Growth” award

Staff Writer

On Nov. 17 in Washington, D.C., the town of Davidson was awarded one of the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) five Awards for Smart Growth Achievement in Overall Excellence.

One hundred twelve cities from 31 states and the District of Columbia applied for the nationwide awards program.

Davidson originally applied for the Small Communities award, but it was elevated to the Overall Excellence category because of the comprehensive nature of the town’s planning philosophy.

The Overall Excellence category recognizes outstanding approaches to smart growth, including built projects, supportive plans and policies, and effective political and community participation.

“They were very impressed with our planning ordinance,” said Davidson’s mayor pro-tem John Woods.

EPA administrator Michael Leavitt confirmed this.

“Davidson has used the principles of smart growth to create a place that respects community, culture, and the environment. It has preserved the character that makes it special,” Leavitt said.

Davidson’s planning ordinance includes significant open space requirements, a restriction of generic and franchise architecture, drive-ins, and a promotion of pedestrian access. It also has an Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance (APFO) that requires 12.5 percent of new housing to be affordable to families making less than the county’s median family income.

New neighborhoods in Davidson feature parks within a five-minute walk of residences, along with a variety of lot sizes and housing types, including affordable housing.

The EPA Award is in its third year of existence.

It recognized one winner in each of the following five categories: Overall Excellence in Smart Growth, Built Projects, Policies and Regulations, Community Outreach and Education, and Small Communities.

The other 2004 recipient cities were Greensboro, NC, Santa Cruz, CA, the Sacramento Area of Governments, Sacramento, CA, and San Juan Pueblo, NM.

Huntersville developer Nate Bowman ’74 received the EPA’s “Built Project Award” at the same time.
