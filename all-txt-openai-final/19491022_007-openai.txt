PIKAS 24—PI KAPPA PHI 0
Jack Fanjoy put on a one-man show in the Pika’s victory over the Pi Kapps as he caught 5 passes and scored 3 touchdowns. L. A. Park accounted for the other score on a pass play. Lenton did all the passing for Pika. Billy Houck provided the Pi Kappa Phi's offense. It was strictly an offensive game with Pika having the edge in first downs by 5-4. It was Pika's third victory against one loss. Pi Kappa Phi has yet to win.

SAE 12—CAMPUS CLUB 0
The SAE's continued their winning streak by downing four times beaten Campus Club. The Campus Club has yet to win and yet to score a single touchdown. Running from a trick T-formation, the SAE’s scored twice early in the game and coasted the rest of the way. It was Ken Goodpasture who accounted for one of the touchdowns and another pass play accounted for the other. First downs were in favor of SAE’s.

K. A. 14—PHI-GAMS 6
Monday afternoon the undefeated K. A.’s were pressed to the limit by a spirited Phi Gam crew. It was not until the second half that either team reached pay dirt. The K.A.'s scored first on a “double sleeper” play that was beautifully executed. Bill Bird faked an aerial to Charlie Mitchell on the right sideline and fired a long pass to the galloping Tucker on the left who raced the remaining eighteen yards for the initial marker. The Phi Gams gave the K.A.'s a taste of their own medicine and pulled a nice sleeper play themselves. This was a Clark-to-Crawley aerial that put the Phi Gams back in the game. With the score tied and fifty seconds to go, the Phi Gams had the ball on the K.A. five but failed to score on two passes and a run. The game went into an extra half that was K.A. all the way. “Glenn Davis" Bird hit “Stump” Asbury for the marker, and, due to the booming kick-offs of Hal Haynes, the Phi Gams were pinned near their goal by a charging K. A. line. The game was K.A. all the way from this point on.

BETAS 18—KAPPA SIG 0
Also on Monday afternoon the very strong, undefeated Beta team crushed the previously undefeated Kappa Sigs, 18-0. The sights of Earl Smith remained in perfect line this week as he repeated last week’s feat and hurled all three passes that hit for Beta tallies. The first aerial was latched on to by Hankins, and the second by Joy. Chuck Elliot made a circus catch of the last pass to end the scoring for the day. It was a spectacular catch. The Betas also showed a nice running offense from scrimmage. The game was rough, both sides running and blocking hard, but the Kappa Sigs were unable to stop the power of the Beta machine.

PI KAPPA'S 12—SIGMA CHI 6
The Pi Kaps and Sigma Chis started the Tuesday afternoon football slate with an exciting game. The Sigma Chis led the Pi Kaps up till the last five minutes of play when a Houckto Carr “sleeper” play pulled the game out of the fire for the Pi Kaps. “Choo Choo” Houck kept the Sigma Chis at bay all day with his accurate aerials, rousing running, powerful punts, and pass interceptions. The Sigma Chis looked very good on offense also, but they could not accrue enough points to defeat the Pi Kaps in the last three minutes. The pass combination of Kelton to Sellers clicked for the only Blue marker. Kelton also looked good on several offensive running plays. The game was a thriller for the Pi Kaps, and a heart-breaker for the Sigma Chis.

S.A.E. 12—S.P.E. 0

The S.A.E.'s unleashed a nice passing attack against the scrappy S.P.E.'s to down them by the score of 12-0. Monty Hill clicked for the first marker of the day on a nice ten-yard jaunt around end. The second tally came on a pass from J.C. Roberts to towering Bud Aiken, who made a nice one-hand stab on the five, pivoted around one man, and downed the spirited Campus Club by the score of 12 to 0. The first half was fairly even, with the only score coming on an intercepted pass by Earl Huie of the Phi Gam, who scooted into pay dirt for the last six-pointer of the day. The booming kick-offs of Charlie Baldwin kept the S.P.E.'s in trouble, as did the brilliant pass interception of “Racehorse” Goodpasture. Jimmy Miller played a good game for the S.P.E.'s, hitting a large percentage of his receivers. Fierce line play was featured by both teams.

PHI GAM 12—CAMPUS CLUB 0

In the only encounter of Wednesday afternoon, the Phi Gams downed the spirited Campus Club by the score of 12 to 0. The first half was fairly even, with the only score coming on an intercepted pass by Earl Huie of the Phi Gam, who scooted into pay dirt for the last six-pointer of the day. The booming kick-offs of Charlie Baldwin kept the S.P.E.'s in trouble, as did the brilliant pass interception of “Racehorse” Goodpasture. Jimmy Miller played a good game for the S.P.E.'s, hitting a large percentage of his receivers. Fierce line play was featured by both teams.

Towel Totin’, Bucket Swinging Foursome Keeps Footballers Going
By DAN McKEITHEN

Although life for the football player is never too rosy, there are a certain group of unpublicized individuals who attempt to make football as pleasant as possible for the players. The group to which the reference is made are the managers of the team. While the job of making things run smoothly on the field is left to the team, the job of making things run smoothly off the field is left to the managers. The managers of our own Red and Black machine are Senior Managers Rucker Dudley and Bill Dubose, and Junior Managers Phil Mitchell and Dave “Shorty” LaFar. Although it might be noticed that all of these men are members of the Kappa Sigma social fraternity, it is general knowledge that a man from another frat might be able, with a little pull, to go out for a managerial post. However, when one knows of the many duties which managers must perform, he usually leaves such a job to the Sigmas.

Phil does quite a bit more than run out on the playing field with a bucket of water and Rucker does not spend all of his afternoons watching practice with a towel around his neck. It adds up to a little work when one has to be a private valet to each hulking monster on the squad. Not only is he a general errand boy, but he might also be labeled as equipment caretaker. Shorty and Bill have spent more enjoyable moments than those that were spent cleaning three inches of mud from the cleats used in the State game. Once in a while the players turn up with dirty equipment; the managers must remedy this. As a sideline, these boys get to take out knee-pads for cleaning of the pants and then are allowed to replace these pads before games. Around game time, the managers deal in such merchandise as oranges, ice, and chewing gum. There are also numerous other little duties that go along with a college football game. The managers often wonder how the players can bring in so much of the playing field with them. It’s a never-ending proposition, that managing and everything else that goes along with it. Here's a hand to the hard-working managers, a vital cog in the Davidson football machine.

Yes, Camels are SO MILD that in a coast-to-coast test of hundreds of men and women who smoked Camels — and only Camels — for 30 consecutive days, noted throat specialists, making weekly examinations, reported NOT ONE SINGLE CASE OF THROAT IRRITATION DUE TO SMOKING CAMELS!
