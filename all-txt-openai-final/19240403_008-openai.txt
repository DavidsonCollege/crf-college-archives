**RACE PROBLEM DISCUSSED**

The Relations of a Higher Race to a Lower were discussed Wednesday night by the discussion groups. The leaders used as the example of the question the thought brought out by Doctor Porter at the leaders’ class, which was the relation of England to India. India is nothing less than a direct colony of England. It seems as if the English, because of their dominating spirit, run things in India as they please, doing so with little regard for the weaker, yet very numerous, inhabitants.Brought out in the Clothing and Haberdashery at the high school in Charleston, W. Va. Discussion, this kind of spirit among the strong nations of the world is far from being brotherly toward those nations who, because of position geographically, religiously, politically, or historically, do not occupy the pinnacle of world influence or even a fair showing in regard to their own government. The key to the whole secret is Christian brotherhood and not rule by might.
