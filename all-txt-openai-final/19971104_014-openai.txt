Now the second season begins. As of today, the regular season is meaningless, replaced by the always exciting Southern Conference
tournament. With three conference teams currently ranked in the regional top ten, the tournament looks to be as competitive as
ever.

"Winning the tournament would give the Wildcats an opportunity to host the Big South tournament winner. The winner of that
game would advance to the NCAA’s," said coach Charlie Slagle. And although an at-large NCAA bid is impossible for Davidson
this year, the conference tournament presents another avenue into the postseason tournament.

Davidson hosts seventh-seeded VMI, a team the Wildcats beat just a week ago, tonight at 6:15. "VMI has the revenge
factor," said Slagle. "They don’t want a repeat of last Tuesday. On the other hand, a win (tonight) would give
us a .500 record, quite an accomplishment, considering we started out the season 0-5 and 3-9."

UNC Greensboro, with a 4-0 win over Georgia Southern Saturday night, earned the top seed in the tournament. They host
the eighth seed, The Citadel, today. In other first-round games today, sixth-seeded Wofford travels to Greenville to face third-seeded Furman
and fifth-seeded App. St. visits Statesboro to battle the fourth seed, Georgia Southern.

Davidson is the only team in the conference that has defeated UNC Greensboro, Furman, and Georgia Southern. "But the first
step is making it to the weekend," said Slagle. "Right now, we're as strong as we’ve been all season."

During the regular season, the Wildcats defeated the Paladins 3-1, but because the semi-finals and finals are played in Greenville,
Furman would hold home-field advantage this weekend. But everyone is focused on tonight.

"Obviously we’ve beaten everyone that we’ll potentially play come the weekend," said Slagle. "That itself will be a battle, as
the Wildcats have dropped contests to lowly App. St. and The Citadel. But with victories last week over VMI and
Wofford, inconsistency seems to have left Davidson."

A victory over the competitive Keydets would probably mean a date with Furman on Saturday. "I really hope we get
to play Davidson. Because we'll win," said Furman’s coach.

WILDCAT FOOTBALL

Davidson defense made it happen Wildcats record first shutout of the decade

By Michael J. Kruse Editor in Chief

On paper, Saturday’s football game at Richardson Field looked like anything but a 43-0 drubbing. Considering the lopsided score, a
quick glance at the stat sheet proved a tad puzzling.

As pitiful as Hampden-Sydney was — and the Tigers, now 0-8, were just that, and probably more — the Wildcats
only won the battle of total offense by 18 yards — 193-175. The Tigers earned the advantage in first downs,
collecting 16 to Davidson’s 14.

Both teams’ passing attacks were equally woeful, as Hampden-Sydney collected 98 yards through the air and the Wildcats, who used
four quarterbacks — Tommy Dugan, Shaun Tyrance, Matt Strader, and John Gaither — managed only 80.

And while Hampden-Sydney’s ground game mustered a mere 77 yards, the Wildcats’ wasn’t exactly prolific either, countering with 113.

The difference in this contest? The Wildcat defense. Defensive coordinator Tripp Merritt’s corps forced seven turnovers, five of which led
to Davidson touchdowns.

"That (forcing turnovers) is something the defensive staff has preached the past two weeks, and the kids really responded today,"
coach Tim Landis explained. "We didn’t have a lot of yardage, but we did get the football in great situations."

Indeed, thanks to the Wildcats’ swarming "D," Davidson’s offense didn’t have to rack up much yardage at all on its
way to scores. Four of the Wildcats’ five touchdown drives — the sixth came on an interception return by Clif
Henry with under a minute left in the first half — wereless than 32 yards and ate no more than
2:16 off the clock. And the one that didn’t wasn’t exactly methodical either, as the Wildcats used just seven plays
and 3:16 to go 58 yards for their fifth touchdown.

“That’s as fine a defensive effort as we've had in the past five years,” Landis said. “It speaks a lot
of our guys on the defensive side of the football.”

“Coach Merritt has been really working hard. He spent some extra time watching films,” said stellar rookie lineman Bo Henderson,
who led the Wildcats with 11 tackles, including three for a loss, recovered two fumbles, and had two sacks. “We
didn’t really make any adjustments. We just had really hard practices this week. Everybody worked really hard.”

So much so that even the offense took note.

“The defense played one of the best games I’ve seen them play,” said tailback Nate Hagerman, who scored the Wildcats’
second touchdown of the day. “They played great team defense. Freeman (Belser) and Bo played great, and the defensive back
played really solid for the first time since the first couple of weeks.”

Belser had nine takedowns to go with an interception, while Shreve Ariail added seven and Ben Spivey and Chris Hess
each pitched in six apiece. Spivey had a sack, and Hess and Ariail each had one tackle for a loss.
Chris Frederick also had six tackles and recovered a fumble.

Passing glory

Hagerman, who was a star quarterback in high school for Bishop Verot in Fort Myers, Fla., attempted his first collegiate
pass Saturday against Hampden-Sydney. His halfback option bomb, which came on a third-and-goal play from the 35-yard line early in
the fourth quarter, was actually caught in the end zone by Corey Crawford. But a penalty negated his bid for
a touchdown pass to go with a second-quarter scoring run.

“That was frustrating because it was the first time I was able to toss it in a (college) game,” Hagerman
said. “I was so happy, but then I saw the flag. It was still nice, even though it didn’t count.”

“On third-and-goal from the 35, as an offensive coach, I don’t really have a play for that situation,” Landis quipped.
“That’s the only one I could think of. So we went with Nate, who played quarterback in high school.”

Jamel Wynn, a 6-foot-1, 232-pound offensive lineman from Greensboro, Ga., suffered a second-degree medial collateral ligament tear Wednesday in practice
and is out for the season. The Wildcats compensated for the loss on Saturday by playing freshman Matt Berry at
center and shifting regular center Chip Stewart to tackle.
