**Work-study positions on the decline**

by Boe Young ‘83

The College employs 160 work-study students this year, 34 students fewer than it employed last year on the work-study program.

The maximum number of hours allotted to students per week rose from 10 hours last year to this year’s levels of 12.5 hours for freshmen and 15 hours for upperclassmen.

The number of “regular work” employees whose financial aid comes from the College as a loan rose from 71 to 107.

As a result of large Congressional budget cuts in student aid programs, administrators have been forced to use College funds to finance a large percentage of loan and work-study programs.

According to Admissions Director John Griffeth, the budget cuts forced significant changes in the operation of the aid program.

In the past, the College has assisted students with all of their financial needs. The three-tiered assistance program involves scholarships, direct loans, and work-study.

Formerly, virtually all loan money and nearly 80 percent of all work-study finances were supplied by the government. With the budget reductions, the number of National Direct Student Loans that the College received was significantly reduced while the work-study program was placed in a “non-growth” status.

Consequently, the College had only enough funds to finance upperclassmen. A new loan fund for freshmen had to be created out of a College money pool called the Endowment Scholarship Fund. The Endowment Scholarship Fund is made up of endowments and investments. Money from the fund had to be allocated to the work-study program.

Sophomore work-study employee Frances Palmer was allotted 15 hours of work per week. She says that she has yet to be able to work the maximum amount due to lack of work and overcrowding in her department. Another sophomore, Jenny O’Briant, voiced the same complaint of being underworked. Yet both felt that their workload will increase as school progresses.

Despite the financial squeeze, Griffeth emphasized that the College has been able to maintain the same scholarship to self-help ratio as last year.

He added that it is a great “burden” for the College to continue to use the Endowment Scholarship Fund for freshmen loans and work-study.

**Cafe arises from Snack Bar phoenix**

by Tim Whalen '82

The old Union Snack Bar disappeared over the summer and the College Dining Service created a Union Café in its place. Dining Service Director Carlton Pritchard said the café is the most exciting project he’s worked on at Davidson. The most obvious change from the old Snack Bar is that now customers serve themselves instead of ordering everything over the counter. Café manager Nancy Heisel said the self-service system moves people through faster, so lines do not get as long as they did with the old system. Pritchard said under the new system customers receive their grill orders more quickly.

The café features new food as well as a new service line. The café offers an assortment of Sealtest ice creams, sherbets, and frozen yogurt. Nancy said she expects to get blenders for shakes and fancy fruit drinks. She arranges to have a different luncheon special every day. The Dining Service is going to redecorate the café sometime before Christmas. Nancy said the decorations will reflect the café’s name, or at least bring in some bright color. She said she welcomes student input into decorating plans and also menu selection.

The Union Café has different hours than the Snack Bar did. The café opens at 9:30 am and closes with the Union. Meal cards may not be used after 4:30, however.

Managing the Union Café is Nancy’s first job out of college. She graduated in Food Systems Management from the University of Missouri last year.
