"I can put the way I felt when I first got here in two words—shell shock," said freshman Lisa Ryan almost one week after she left everything familiar behind her and came to Davidson.

Since that first traumatic day, Lisa and her 347 classmates have been submerged in a flurry of hectic orientation activities designed to show them their way around campus and get them settled into their class routines.

There was that people hunt in front of Chambers in the dark and the cake race which got rained out just as most of the cakes were being given away. And speeches.

"The people hunt was one of the best things. Just running around, running into everybody and seeing some of the weird things they had in their background. It was fun to actually be found by someone. I got found once," said Ed Trumbull.

"I didn’t run in the cake race but I watched it. Our hall got four cakes—I live on third Cannon. Then we shared our cakes with five more cakes from second Richardson," said Nan Zimerman.

Then there was the freshman talent show, "Gong Show," where people were gonged off the stage for clamping out "Dixie" on the "Magic molars" and for accusing Dean Terry of fixing them up with an eight-foot girl. And more speeches.

"I thought the talent show was the best thing because it got our entire hall involved," said Charles Luecker of first Richardson. "There was some good comedy."

Just about every administration figure who works closely with students gave a speech during the first days of orientation. Some students liked that and some were interested and thought it put you in a relaxed mood. It kept you busy enough so you didn’t start thinking about home for the first time. There were so many speakers.

Freshman year is a time of adjustment and excitement. The orientation activities, though hectic, help ease the transition into college life.
