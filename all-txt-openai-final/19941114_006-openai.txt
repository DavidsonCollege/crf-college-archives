**Congress turned upside down**

By Andrea Short

Political analysts have been predicting a strong Republican showing for weeks, but regaining both the House and Senate majority was beyond even Rush Limbaugh’s wildest dreams. Capitol Hill is in flux as incumbent Democrats receive notice that they and their staffs must clear out by December 15, and the Democrats who remain face a party that lacks any obvious leadership.

Senator Bob Dole from Kansas is expected to become the new Senate majority leader in December. He will control only a slight majority, however, with the Republicans holding 53 seats to the Democrats' 46 (one seat is still undecided). His counterpart in the House will most likely be Representative Newt Gingrich from Georgia. The former history teacher will preside over 227 Republicans and 199 Democrats (eight races remain undecided). Neither the Senate nor the House contains a Republican majority strong enough to override presidential vetoes on most issues, but the Republicans do have the numbers to make President Clinton’s relationship with Congress even more difficult.

Top Republicans are rejoicing over their new power and wasted no time in making promises to the American people. The chairman of the Republican Senate campaign committee, Senator Phil Gramm from Texas, said, “The American people have given us the ball. I don’t intend to see us fumble.” Many of the victorious Republicans had signed the highly publicized “Contract with America;” Republicans designed this issue platform of tax cuts, a stronger military, a balanced budget, stricter welfare policies, and term limits to serve as a guarantee of accountability to the American people.

While the Republicans eagerly plan for January, Democrats are pondering how the party will look by then. Having lost the majority leader, George Mitchell, to retirement and the Speaker of the House, Tom Foley, to a Republican challenger, the Democrats are doomed to some infighting. Tennessee was the site of a major Democratic defeat as both Rep. Jim Cooper and Sen. Jim Sasser, both rising stars in the party, lost re-election bids. Sasser had been in the running for the Senate Majority Leader with Senator Daschle from South Dakota. Without Sasser, Daschle may actually face more opposition than before; some moderate and conservative Senators have expressed concern about handing the leadership to a liberal Senator, especially in the aftermath of a solid defeat of liberalism in the election.

The Democratic party is not only hurt by losing individual leaders, the Democrats that remain in Congress are decidedly more liberal than the last Congress. This liberalism, coupled with Republican majority control, could spell even more gridlock than Congress experienced last session. Senator John Breaux of Louisiana, a conservative Democrat, said on Wednesday, “We’re in the same position in this Congress as the last Congress. Nobody has 60 votes in the Senate. We can veto things, and they can’t override them. They can block anything we want to pass. It’s a recipe for gridlock.”

#### Dean Rusk Program

**Refugees visit as part of series**

By Graham Ernst

On November 1 in the 900 Room, a panel of three foreign refugees from Vietnam and the former Yugoslavia led an hour-long discussion with Davidson students about each refugee’s experiences and outlooks for the future. The event was part of this month’s series on global refugee issues sponsored by the Dean Rusk Program.

Nedzad Beciragic fled the current civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He initially went to Denmark, where he was not allowed a job and was forced to live off that nation’s welfare system. He has been in the United States for two months and is currently in training to be a pharmacist. Beciragic provided a powerful impact to the discussion when he said that even after the war was over, he would never return to his homeland. He was also skeptical about the ability of foreign forces, including the U.S. and the U.N., to resolve the conflict.

Natasa Mahmutovic also left the fighting in former Yugoslavia to come live in the U.S. While she said she misses her friends, Natasa claimed that there is no way to describe the horror...and true suffering taking place in her country today. Hung Si Le had been a member of the South Vietnamese Army before he was arrested and imprisoned by the Communist regime. With no option to continue living in Vietnam, Hung is thankful to be in the United States which has become his “only choice.”

Sponsors were pleased with the event. Ambassador Jack Perry was impressed by how the forum “brought the problem (global refugees) down to three living human beings.” Ambassador Perry added that listening to and speaking with the panel provided a “powerful emotion” that cannot be obtained by simply reading newspapers or watching television. SGA President Eric Rosenbach, who visited Vietnam this summer, said that hearing the real perspectives of people who are there adds to his understanding of the current situations in Bosnia and Vietnam. Dean Rusk Assistant to Director Kate Crosman thought the panel was effective in showing how past and current tragedies do affect real people. Furthermore, Crosman hopes that this series will raise the general awareness of Davidson students about the growing global refugee crisis. With more than 23 million refugees worldwide, it is clear that this is an issue that is not going away in the near future.

The Dean Rusk Refugee Issues series continues with William Lee from the UN Relief and Works Agency, who will speak about his work in the Middle East tonight. The series will conclude on November 21 when field workers from the Red Cross share their experiences in working with refugees.

Perspective NOTES

Pygmy Hedgehogs

Since pygmy hedgehogs have passed pot-bellied pigs as the new hog on the block, pet-store owners predict a rush of Christmas sales. And animal shelters expect a springtime rush of returns. This worries the U.S. Humane Society’s Ken White. “Hedgehogs,” he says, “are somewhat burrowing animals that are nocturnal. They are not well-suited to a 15-gallon enclosure in your kid’s bedroom.” His concern: “Exotic (animals) are given up (when) people get tired of the novelty and are stuck with the responsibility.” - Katy Kelly, USA Today

Erasing the Past

Divorcees can now eradicate their previous partners from photographs without resorting to a scissor job. DivorceX from Western Pro Imaging Labs of Vancouver, Canada, is a service that scans a photograph into a computer and then alters it electronically. The gap can then be filled by a new partner. The technology can also make people thinner, younger, and can remove double chins or scars. According to company president Keith Guelpha, one customer was a man about to be married. “He had gone traveling around Europe before becoming engaged. There was a different girl in each photo and he wanted them all removed.” - by Barbara Kantrowitz and Jennifer Tanaka, Newsweek

Reagan

Former President Ronald Reagan has Alzheimer’s disease, an incurable brain disorder that causes senile dementia. Reagan’s doctors said today that the 83-year-old ex-president is entering the early stages of the progressive brain disease. “Over the past 12 months, we began to notice from President Reagan’s test results symptoms indicating the possibility of early stage Alzheimer’s disease. Additional testing and an extensive observation over the past few weeks have led us to conclude that President Reagan is entering the early stages of this disease,” the doctors wrote.

Alzheimer’s is a progressive, irreversible neurological disorder. Symptoms include memory loss, impairment of judgment, disorientation and personality change, among others. - Washington Post, November 6
