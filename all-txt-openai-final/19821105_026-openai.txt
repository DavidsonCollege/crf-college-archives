### Gridders Fall to Furman 63-14

By SCOTT HUIE ’85

If Davidson’s five previous losses this season were bitter pills to swallow, then last Saturday’s 63-14 loss to Furman was like swallowing Tylenol—deadly.

For the first half, the Paladins played 24 minutes of near-perfect football, scoring an incredible 56 points while racking up 354 yards rushing and 163 yards passing. Plugging through the Wildcats’ porous defense at will, Furman scored on nine of its ten first-half possessions. The only blemish to an otherwise flawless half was a lost fumble at the Davidson 26, which led to a Wildcat touchdown drive, capped by halfback Leonard Walker’s 12-yard scoring run.

“Furman is just an outstanding football team,” said Coach Ed Farrell, “probably the best we’ve played in a long time. For the most part, we threw the correct defensive design at them, but they handled it every time. There was simply no room for error.”

Okay, coach, you are down by 49 at the half—what do you tell your players during the intermission? Keep the score in double figures?

“Well, at that point,” said Farrell, “we realized we couldn’t do anything to change the outcome, so all I asked of them was to give 100 percent and not to roll over and play dead.”

Apparently, the team heeded the coach’s words as they played to a second-half draw, 7-7. Davidson’s score came on a 34-yard TD strike from backup quarterback Jeff Haney to split end Todd Hermetz, culminating an 80-yard drive. But give a blessing to the generous Furman coaching staff, which played only scrubs in the second half and used a two-play offense—fullback up the middle and halfback around end.

For the record, the Cats totaled 343 offensive yards, the Paladins 629 yards (that’s no misprint). Quarterback Keith Mann completed only 7 of 23 passes for 86 yards and two interceptions. Reserves Haney and Jay Poag both saw action in the second half, throwing for a combined total of 100 yards.

In the rushing department, Walker carried the ball 12 times for 41 yards, and fullback Bob Miller gained 37 yards in 11 carries. Defensively, end D. E. Wright and cornerback Kendrick Williams stole the honors with 15 and 13 tackles.

Lost to injury in the running back shuffle is halfback David Turner, who reinjured his shoulder. Junior Alan Rosier will step in as his replacement.

Tomorrow, the Cats return for their final home game of the season as they tackle Bucknell (3-4), who last week lost to a strong Lehigh team 21-10. Last year, the Bisons buried the Cats 23-3. Overall, Bucknell lacks speed and finesse but compensates with size and strength, especially on defense. Offensively, they run from the same wing-T formation as Davidson.

With his team coming off three consecutive embarrassments on the road, Farrell said, “There is always the danger of being overly weary after being beaten so badly three weeks in a row. It can be both physically and mentally telling on us. But I don’t get the impression that it’s having that much of a negative impact on the fellows. Plus, I don’t think Bucknell is on the same level as our last three opponents.”

With that in mind, I am going with the upset. This being parents’ weekend and the last home game of the season, the crowd support should be tremendous. Thus, the Cats, hungry for the taste of victory, should have a little extra motivation. Martin should be able to exploit a vulnerable Bison secondary. Look for both teams to score big.

Huie’s Prediction:  
Davidson 35  
Bucknell 30

### Hockey Disappointed

By KARA GILMORE ’85

The women’s field hockey team finished up the season this past weekend at the Deep South Tournament in Boone. Unfortunately, they didn’t finish up the way they would have liked, dropping the final four games of the year.

There was, however, one very bright spot in the weekend. In addition to being a team tournament, Deep South is also a tournament in which individual players are selected for All-Star teams. Four teams are chosen: first team for college players; first team for club players; and second and third mixed teams. Amy Crittenberger earned the distinction of being chosen for the first team, a real honor as one of the top eleven players out of a field of about 200. From here, Amy will go to another selection tournament to be held in High Point the weekend of 12 November. She will be vying for a spot on the Southeast team. If she is chosen for this team, she will go on to play at a National Tournament in Orlando, Florida, 25-28 November.

As said before, the weekend for the team was very disappointing. Starting on Thursday, we dropped a 5-0 decision to Duke. The next day, we played Duke again as part of the Deep South Tournament. We played an excellent game but were again unable to score and lost 2-0.

Saturday night, under the lights on the Astroturf, we played the Carolina Club team; our slide continued as we fell to them 3-0. Sunday morning, we played our final game of the season against Clemson Club. We played a very good, even game but were still unable to connect with the net and lost a heartbreaker.
