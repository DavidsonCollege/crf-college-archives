Hitch-Hiker’s Union Formed
Ponies may soon be asking for a card before he will admit them in his car for a ride; that is, this situation may arise if the plan of the SSTA is carried out. What is the SSTA and what is this plan? Simply this: Five students in colleges in the two Carolinas have organized the Sail Scholastic Thumbers’ Association. The association is an inauguration of a campaign in favor of hitch-hiking by college students. Each member is furnished with a card which tells the motorist that he is a bona fide student and gives him a signed statement of release from liability. The card will be given to the driver to impress upon him the number of students who are traveling on the thumb and will make him more willing to pick up hitch-hiking students when he has such a guarantee from the association.

Library Buys New Volume
Five New Books Added to Shelves of Library in Past Few Days

Five new books on various topics were received by the college library during the past week. They are “How to Read a Book,” “How Green Was My Valley,” “The Story of Civilization,” “Twenty Best Plays of the American Stage,” and “The New Deal In Action, 1933-1939.”

Essay
“How to Read a Book” is by Dr. Mortimer J. Adler and is divided into three parts. The first tells how to read; the second, what to read; and the third is called “Rest of the Reader’s Life” and deals with the basic reasons for literacy. In the appendix, Dr. Adler lists the great books of all times. This list is based on similar ones used by the University of Chicago, Columbia College, St. John’s, and elsewhere.

Novel
“How Green Was My Valley” is a novel by Richard Llewellyn. It is the story of Wales full of comedy and tragedy of life itself. The story is of a large Welsh family, the Morgans. Huw, one of the children, tells the story in his memories. He is now an old man of sixty years and is about to leave the Valley forever because mining is no longer an industry in what has been his home.

History

“I marvel,” said Paul, still wondering about the cider, “as to what may be the meaning of all these lights.”

“Ah, that is easily remedied,” replied the watchman. “Do you see the light a bit farther on? 'Tis Dook, where some student laboreth on a term paper. Have you ne'er heard of a term paper? 'Tis a wondrous thing. One forgets it for two months, puts it off another month, worries about it for two weeks, and writes it in one night.”

Proposed Reunion
Presbyterian Church Discussed By Currie

In arguments for and against reuniting the Student Sunday School, the sentiment that the country is united and the church should be united is sentimental. He explained that political union is not happy if there are conflicting principles in the union and that it would be a mistake to reunite unless it was a reunion of spirit as well as form. Since the separation, beliefs have changed in principle. An example of this, illustrated by Dr. Currie, is the highly controversial Auburn Affirmation.

Dr. Currie gave the points in favor of becoming one church, namely, that the country is united, and the church should be reunited also; that the force of Christianity would present a stronger front if united; that at present there is an overlapping of Northern and Southern churches in the border states; and that union is the trend of the times as shown by the union of the Methodist Church.

The situation at present, however, is that the church has been divided for over 100 years, Dr. Currie pointed out, and the burden of proof rests on the persons in favor of change. So in the argument against reunion, the points presented by the proponents were marshaled against. The speaker showed that the arguments do not affect one so much, but the last and greatest reason for not uniting is impressive. In this age, many people are no longer united by right and wrong, but by intelligence. Principles of peasant living are being adopted while principles of natural and revealed law are being discarded.
