**Kuykendall discusses plans for**

By JOHN BARROW & MARK CHEN

[Ed. Note: The editors asked President Kuykendall to comment on recent tenure decisions and to discuss the tenure system in
general. President Kuykendall felt the time was inappropriate and declined.]

**Davidsonian:** This past weekend, the Board of Trustees met and discussed several important issues — the school's investment policy, a
new funds campaign, and new student housing among other things. What, in your opinion, were some of the most crucial
matters acted upon by the Board in relation to the future of the College?

**Kuykendall:** Obviously, the ones you named, John, I think are all significant and in most instances represent the culmination of
a lot of study and thought. We are not through with the discussion of the Capital Funds drive as you
know. We did a kind of a dry run of what we are calling a “Focus Meeting” which is really
a piece of a feasibility study to see if the kinds of projections we are making about necessary funding as
we see it are reasonable in terms of the giving capacity of Davidson’s constituents. So that’s in process; it’s not
really a decision but it’s another step along the way. We’ll come back to the Board in October with a
little more information. I anticipate either in October or February being able to say “O.K. folks, here it is, it’s
laid out — please weigh in the tenure decision.”

The decision to deny tenure to Davidson English professor Dr. John Engell, revealed to students last week after the May
1 meeting of the Board of Trustees approved it, has aroused a storm of controversy, especially from those who have
studied under him. A denial of tenure means that Dr. Engell will not be allowed to teach at Davidson after
next term, and it will almost certainly affect adversely his ability to find future employment.

Many of his former students have taken actions to try to persuade the administrators to reverse their decision; however, according
to Vice President Robert C. Williams, the decision has already been made by the Board of Trustees and is final.
While the Trustees approved tenure for Dr. Cole Barton, Dr. Irwin Goldstein, Dr. Ralph Levering, and Dr. John Heil, according
to Dean Williams, after reviewing Dr. Engell’s performance at Davidson, he decided for reasons that are strictly confidential that Engell
should not be granted tenure.

In a statement released to the student body, Williams explained that “Teaching, professional development, and service to the college and
community all weigh in the tenure decision.” “Professional development” refers to ongoing scholarly activity — such as research and publishing.
Many students have speculated that it was in this area that Dr. Engell was judged to have fallen short, but
there has been no statement made to suggest this conclusively; the faculty must remain silent on the subject, as must
Williams and Kuykendall.

The faculty has little part in any tenure decisions; Williams explains that, although other professors offer advice, Davidson is unusual
in that such decisions have been allocated entirely to him and Kuykendall, and they seek the approval.of the Trustees. He
suggests that perhaps peer evaluation is a better method for the decision to release Qs. Engell was certainly not made
in haste. Following formal procedure, he began to evaluate those professors whose six years of experience made them eligible in
the early fall. His statement mentions that tenure is “a decision which can only be positive if and only if
there are absolutely no doubts about an individual’s past performance and possibilities for future contribution to the life of the
college.” He explains that the matter has been completely silenced because tenure is a “judgement call” and that a grant
of tenure constitutes a permanent decision — perhaps a permanent error. Thus, the tenure decisions are a highly sensitive topic
which faculty members will not discuss with the student body. Several former students of Engell’s have circulated a petition in
favor of reinstating Engell; signs have been posted in Chambers. The Professional Affairs Committee, a faculty group concerned with the
role of professors at Davidson, has, according to committee chairman Dr. Kazee, plans to meet with Kuykendall and Williams to
discuss the decision because a denial of tenure has an obvious bearing on the administration’s expectations of professors.

The faculty voted 56 to 50 to switch to a semester system with a 34 credit graduation requirement to take
effect the 1988-89 school year. The 34 course requirement is a compromise between the originally proposed 32 course requirement and
a 36 course proposal, which was made during the course of the two-hour meeting. The extra courses were added to
provide for broader educational opportunities. Furthermore, there was some concern expressed that students would be given more free time that
would not be used constructively.

The new graduation requirements mean that students who don’t have any advanced placement credit will take five classes any two
semesters and four classes for each of the remaining six semesters. Professors will have eleven classes over a two-year period,
meaning a teaching load of three classes for three terms, and two classes for one. By switching to the semester
system, Davidson will have a calendar that is consistent with more schools. “We’re not revolutionary, we’re just following a national
trend,” said Dean of Faculty and Vice-president of Academic Affairs. According to Williams, the new system will allow for easier
transfer of students and faculty from other institutions. Also, more time will be allowed for in-depth study in conventional courses
and independent study. Details still have to be worked out in the system concerning matters such as core curriculum and
the impact upon students who are already enrolled when it takes effect. Williams said that the classes of 1989 and
1990 should still expect to have 36 credits for graduation. The SGA and the Educational Policy Committee will address student
concerns about the new system. “There is going to be an active dialogue between the student body and the EPC,”
said SGA President Conrad Doenges. Doenges feels that a lot of student input will mean that there will be fewer
kinks to be worked out when the system takes effect.
