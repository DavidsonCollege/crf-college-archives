TRAIN WITH THE NUCLEAR INDUSTRY'S
LEADER, AND YOU COULD END UP
LEADING THE INDUSTRY.

Over half the nuclear reactors in America
are operated by one organization: The Navy.
The technology is the most advanced in
the world. The men in charge are the
industry’s best. That’s why the Navy Nuclear
Propulsion Officer Candidacy Program is the
most sophisticated training available.

College juniors and seniors who qualify
for the program can earn $1,000 a month
while still in school. In addition, you get a
$3,000 bonus when entering the
program, and an additional $3,000 when
you complete your Naval studies.

And, as an officer in today’s Nuclear
Navy, you receive a year of paid graduate-
level training — gaining the experience and
credentials that can put you at the forefront
of the nuclear industry.

You must be a U.S. citizen, 26½ years
of age or younger upon commissioning,
working toward a bachelor’s or master's
degree. You must also have completed a
minimum of one year each of calculus and
calculus-based physics with a “B” average
or better.

So if you’ve started thinking about a
career in the nuclear field, think about
starting at the top. You can apply after your
sophomore year. Call Navy Management
