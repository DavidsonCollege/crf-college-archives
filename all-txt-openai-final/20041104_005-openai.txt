"We wanted to give students autonomy and a chance to explore, while also honoring the ideals the Bonners had when
they founded this program," said Director of Community Service and Bonner Scholars Rosie Molinary.

Bonner Scholars are required to volunteer for the After School Program during their freshman year and are then allowed to
pursue their individual service passions the remaining years. However, many Bonner Scholars come back to Ada Jenkins following their freshman
year.

"Several Bonners have stayed with the same kid for all four years," said Molinary.

Davidson students also participate in the Free Clinic of Our Towns at the Ada Jenkins Center. This program is run
by Davidson College students and a small group of doctors who receive no compensation for their services.

"The Free Clinic of Our Towns provides primary care, prescriptions, check-ups, and referrals to patients without health insurance," said Stuart
Tomko '05, a volunteer at the Free Clinic of Our Towns.

Helen Nguyen '05 and two local doctors, Dr. Craig White and Dr. Steve Williamson, established the center about a year
and a half ago after another free clinic in the area shut down.

"Dr. Craig White, a Davidson College grad who has a family practice office in the building behind the Soda Shop,
and myself worked for several years at a free clinic in Huntersville. This clinic was also staffed by several Davidson
College students. When the clinic closed in the summer of 2002, Dr. White and myself began to explore the possibility
of starting a clinic in Davidson," said Williamson.

A majority of the patients are Hispanic for whom English is a second language. Students ease communication between the doctor
and the patient by serving as translators.

"I volunteer as an interpreter at the clinic, basically helping any Spanish-speaking patient who comes in that does not know
enough English to appropriately communicate with the doctors, nurses, and students of the clinic. It is a vital part of
Free Clinic of Our Towns as I would say at least fifty percent of our patients are limited English," said
Timothy Fuller '05.

These surveys allow the office to draw conclusions about different generations of alumni; they also reflect the changes that Davidson
College has undergone over the years.

Davidson graduates remain consistently attracted to the legal and medical professions, as ten percent of alumni are lawyers and fifteen
percent are either doctors or work in the medical field. Seven percent work in education.

The number of Davidson alumni who go on to become ministers, however, has dropped drastically over the past fifty years.
In the 1950s, fifteen percent of graduates went on to seminary; today less than four percent choose a spiritual profession.

"In the Class of 1949, out of 191 students, 42 became ministers," Merrell said. "They had just gotten back from
the war, and they had been influenced by what they saw."

College Chaplain Rob Spach attributes this drop to the strong connection that Davidson had to the Presbyterian Church in the
past and to the school’s current acceptance of a variety of religious traditions.

"Thirty or forty years ago, most of the faculty was Presbyterian," Spach said. "The entire religion faculty consisted of ordained
Presbyterian ministers. There was a much more homogenous religious life, which contributed to more students being interested in ordained ministry."

Although the number of alumni who become ministers has dropped overall, it has increased over the last ten years.

The renewed interest in the ministry resulted from the strengthening of the pre-ministerial committee, a faculty committee that administers scholarships
and grants and provides information to students interested in attending seminary.

The committee also hosts representatives from seminaries and divinity schools on Theological Education Day, in addition to sponsoring a dinner
with a religious speaker and local pastors who are Davidson alumni.

Although Davidson graduates differ across the generations, the Alumni Office has recently been trying to bring together alumni who share
common interests but did not graduate in the same class.

"We recognize that people make strong connections at Davidson outside their class," Merrell said. "We are finding affiliations and groups
of common interest and inviting them back."

In 2002, Davidson alumni who served in World War II returned to campus and published a book of their experiences.
During the 2005 spring reunion weekend, the Alumni Office will host a reunion of jazz band members. They will be
given time to rehearse together and will perform a piece on the Saturday of reunion weekend.

One of the most significant gatherings occurred last spring. Bill Eskridge, a Davidson alumnus who is a faculty member at
Yale and one of the premier legal scholars on same-sex marriage, spoke to the campus at large and then joined
gay alumni and their partners in a dinner and a breakfast sponsored by the Alumni Office.

"The event was extremely well received," Merrell said. "Many of our gay alumni didn’t have a positive experience here, and
it was very meaningful to them that the college reached out to them in such a significant way."

Although the research conducted by the Alumni Office often highlights the differences between different generations of alumni, Merrell believes that
past and present Davidson students share the same characteristics.

"Students today have a reputation for having a real decency and a real selflessness," Merrell said. "If you look back
fifty years, all those same qualities apply to the alumni. We call the Davidson minister or small business owner the
‘go-to guy,’ the guy you need to run the PTA or coach the baseball team. They are dependable, responsible leaders
in their communities."
