Recognize the windows? The Onion was once the ’braire.

College Archives

Question of the week: Why is the 900 Room called the 900 Room?

Director of the Union William Brown says that, “In the days when this building was a library, the floor that is now the balcony went all the way across. On that floor, the large majority of the books... were the 900 number books, [which is] the history section of the Dewey Decimal system.” When the Grey Library was being converted to what is today’s College Union, “they knocked out the floor to open the room up and to create the space we have now,” Brown says. Then when it came time to dedicate the new space, Brown says “some great soul had the idea that we call it the 900 Room," as it is known today.

Relax.

Come to the 900 Room this Friday, September 27. We’ll be open for all ages 5:30-midnight, serving (as always) a fine assortment of domestic, premium, and import beers, as well as draft beer, sodas, juices, and snacks. Just don’t bring your homework, and don’t tell us how many papers you have next week.

Brought to you by the 900 Room bartending staff: Don’t forget your Davidson ID, two IDs if you want to drink alcohol. Any questions? Call Zac (896-2016)
