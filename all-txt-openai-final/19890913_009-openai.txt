Co-captains Nazemetz and Schiavi anticipate wins

By JIGGY MAXWELL
For the past three seasons, defensive tackle Ken Nazemetz (6'-1", 225) and strong safety/linebacker Harry Schiavi (5'-9", 185) have been the core of the Davidson defense. Their teammates honored this commitment last year by electing them as co-captains for the 1989 season.

Nazemetz, a psychology major from Warren, New Jersey, has been a team leader in tackles and sacks for his entire career. It was his play, as well as that of the rest of the line, that caused teams to move away from the run against the Wildcats in 1988.

Schiavi, an economics major from Wilmington, Delaware, has come back from an injury-plagued 1988 season and moved from strong safety to linebacker. Schiavi plays with a hard-nosed determination and an almost brutal love for hard hits that will surely lead to success in his new position.

Both players were deeply honored to be chosen as co-captains for this season. “After all,” said Schiavi, “that’s not somebody punching typewriter keys for the paper...that’s the guys you work with in practice every day recognizing what you’ve done over the years.” Nazemetz echoed that sentiment. “Being named co-captain was probably one of my highest moments at Davidson,” he said. He also commented that he has enjoyed playing with his friends and teammates and working with the coaches. “That's what made football fun at Davidson,” he said.

But as every Wildcat fan knows, the past three years have seen their share of disappointment, not the least of which was the Trustee decision to drop football to Division III. Both Nazemetz and Schiavi expressed their distaste for that decision.

“But 1989 is a clean slate,” declared Schiavi, “and I think we answered a lot of questions about this ball club on Saturday against Millsaps.”

“This year,” Nazemetz predicted, “the fans that come out and support us are definitely going to see some wins on the board...it’s up to us to be the best Division III football team we can be.”

If these two determined co-captains have anything to do with it, the rest of the season could look much like Saturday’s win.

Co-captains Kenny Nazemetz, #93, and Harry Schiavi, #22, plan to lead the Wildcats to a successful first year at Division III.
