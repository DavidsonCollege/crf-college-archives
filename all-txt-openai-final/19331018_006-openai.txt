points. The V. P. I. touchdowns came in the first and second periods. During the last half, the Indians had
a decided edge, making numerous gains on short passes, and finally pushing over a score in the final quarter. Georgia’s
powerful team entirely outclassed the University of North Carolina aggregation, as a galaxy of Bulldog backs led by George Chapman
rolled up 354 yards of net ground gained during the fray. The Bulldogs

hard-fought imbroglio being 6 to 0. In three contests, Duke has tallied 69 points to their opponents’ 8; having played
four games, Davidson is credited with 40 points, while their opponents are chalked up with 19. But the Blue Devils,
although it was their first game of the season, looked impressive in crushing V. M. I, 37-6, whereas the 'Cats
found themselves hard pressed last Saturday to win by one touchdown. Moreover, Duke will have a distinct advantage over the
Wildcats on account of having met Tennessee, whose system of play is the same as that of Davidson. Both teams
should be able to put their full strength on the field next Saturday. Captain Charlie Rives, who sustained a knee
injury in the game with Carolina, had recovered sufficiently to see service in the game last week, and Willson, ’Cat
fullback, and Cathey, tackle, will probably be in condition by game time. Davidson will have trouble in holding the Blue
Devil forward wall, which consists of such bone-breakers as Freddy Crawford, Dunlap, and Durner. In the backfield, Duke will have
the fast-moving Corky Cornelius, who made all ten points gained by his team in the Tennessee game, and the sagacious
Nick Laney, the “Crooning Halfback.” But the Blue Devils will run up against one of the fastest and best backfields
in the state when players such as Pittman, Hutchins, Mackorell, Wingfield, Willson, and Verble get into action. Once under way,
the ’Cat pony backs will be hard to bring down. Coaches Newton and McEver are expecting the coming game to
be the hardest of the season for the Wildcats, and are drilling the men accordingly, with hopes of making a
good showing against the team which had power enough to subdue Tennessee, “The King of Southern Football.”

NICK LANEY TO PLAY FOR PAN-HELLENIC DANCES
(Continued from page 1)

Nick Laney has been announcing this group of dances in Duke during the past week. The Council reports that tickets
are now on sale for the group of dances, thePrice for the series being three dollars, while the tickets, if
bought separately, will amount to two dollars for the Friday night dance and the admission Saturday night, one dollar and
a half. Tickets may be obtained from any member of the Pan-Hellenic Council. Most of the social fraternities, of course,
are sponsoring house parties for this weekend, and are expecting a large number of girls for this, the first school
dance of the year. Taking into consideration the time and trouble which have been put into the plans, Davidson students
may expect another successful and entertaining time when the date of the annual Homecoming rolls around next Friday.

DAVIDSON REPRESENTED AT COLLEGIATE CONFAB
(Continued from page 1)

National Inter-Scholastic Press Association held at the LaSalle Hotel in Chicago. Some of the interesting items on the program were
talks given by Professor Kenneth E. Olsen, of the University of Minnesota, on “Journalism Against Art,” and “Typography.” Another interesting
talk was by J. N. Krohne, head of the advertising department of Marshal Fields in Chicago. There was a social
function after a banquet held in the hotel ballroom. On Saturday morning, the editorial and business sections convened to hear
Professor Olsen speak on “Typography as An Aid to Better College Publications.” After round table discussions and the final convocation,
Professor John Guy Fowlkes discussed “Publications and Institutions.” The newspaper round table discussions were held in the Roosevelt Room under
the direction of F. J. Noer of Wisconsin. Ravenel attended the business section program. Interesting discussion groups were held on
“Publication Records” by Carroll Geddes. The yearbook round tables were under the leadership of Otis Dypwick.

Tional Affairs, in London, comes to Davidson on November 24th, under the auspices of the International Relations Club, having expressed
a desire to see something of the Southern States before returning to England. His subject, other than that it will
be concerning history, has not been announced.
