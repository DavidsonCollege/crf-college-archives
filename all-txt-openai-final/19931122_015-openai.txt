Lady Cats hope to run & gun their way to a few surprises

By Rick Thurmond

At first glance, it looks like it will be a rough season for the hoopcats this year. In only their
second season back on the varsity level, this year’s squad moves into the competitive Southern Conference with no seniors. Almost
every team they face will be a taller one. But, as second-year coach John Filar will tell you, the Cats
may shock some people.

Filar has a very deep and versatile team that he feels may surprise some folks this year with an up-tempo,
fast break game. Look for sophomores Tonya Sharpe and Maggie Young to lead the charge on the break. Sharpe started
every game last season and her 11.4 ppg was good for third on the team. Young, who scored 8.5 ppg,
will be counted on as the primary outside threat. Lisa Lyons, a junior who can help in any area, be
it ball handling or defense, provides a spark when she is on the floor.

Despite the emphasis on the transition game, the two top returning scorers for the Wildcats do most of their work
down low. Sophomore Erin Butcher led the team in scoring as well as rebounding, with 17.3 ppg and 12.3 rpg,
respectively. The latter figure placed her ninth in the nation among Division I players.

Kristen Ferucci, also a sophomore, is back at full strength this year. Her rookie season, in which she averaged 11.7
ppg and 8.0 rpg, was cut short after ten games by a broken leg. A third sophomore, Molly Burke, worked
extremely hard over the summer, participating in various basketball camps. She will also figure heavily into plans in the paint.
Junior Kristin Solsrud provides leadership and an outside threat from the forward position.

An excellent and deep freshman class will be a key to any success the Cats have this season. Filar has
recruited two point guards who, in his words, “can both fly” and will direct the show. Elizabeth Dubose, from Charlotte,
and Monica Winters should combine to offset the loss of last year’s point, Jennifer Roos. Roos will still be on
the bench this year, though, as an assistant coach. The two other signees, Carolyn Kirsch and Amy Scalcucci, can contribute
either down low or outside on the perimeter. All four have already made an impact in practice this year with
their enthusiasm and intensity and Filar says they “will see considerable playing time.”

The tallest player among these four, though, is only 5’11”. This intensifies Filar’s worries about his team’s lack of size.

“We’re not big. That’s the biggest concern. We don’t have a whole lot of height and we don’t have a
whole lot of bulk.”

The Cats will combat this weakness with their running game.

“We feel like we are going to have to run. We want to make it exciting and we don’t want
to get into any half-court games.”

If the Cats can get the running game cranked up, Filar feels his group can make an impact in the
conference.

“I think we can surprise a few teams in the Southern Conference this season. They’re not really looking for a
whole lot out of us yet and I think they should be surprised. I think any Southern Conference team will
have to come in here and play their game in order to beat us. I’ll be disappointed if we aren’t
at least competitive with the bottom three teams.”
