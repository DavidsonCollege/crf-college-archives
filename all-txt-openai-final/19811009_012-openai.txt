; ) WHAT'S COME OVER YOU? HOW COULD WE - YOUR LASERWARE BE IN DANGER HERE — IN THE BROTHERHOOD
OF SCIENCE'S CENTRAL COMPLEX?

DON’T YOU SEE, REGAL? IF THE BROTHERHOOD TOLD EVERYONE THE TRUTH - THAT OUR COSMOS IS COLLAPSING BACK INTO ITS
PRIMAL STATE - THERE WOULD BE MASS RIOTING AND REVOLUTION! ONLY BY PROMISING US LIFE AFTER THE CATACLYSM CAN THEY
MAINTAIN CONTROL OVER THE PLANET'S 2 BILLION INHABITANTS.

YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HELL LIKE IT WAS A REAL PLACE, ALEYTIS.

FOOT SENTRY'S POWER MAIN WRENCHES THE WEAPON FROM THE SLUMPED MECHANOID'S HAND AND BEGINS TO MELT A HOLE IN THE
WALL!

ADAM! ARE YOU INSANE? THAT'S BROTHERHOOD PROPERTY. YOU COULD GO TO JAIL FOR THIS.

NEVER...

ADAM AND REGAL CIRCLED INTO THE REMOTE INDUSTRIAL REGION OF THE CITY IN AN ATTEMPT TO AVOID THE BROTHERHOOD'S TRUTH
OFFICERS AND FIND THEIR SHUTTLECRAFT. SUDDENLY, THEY CROSS RIOTOUS MUTANT WORKERS DISMEMBERING MAINTENANCE ROBOTS!

SHH! I'M FINE, REGAL. I'LL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING, BUT FIRST, WE'VE GOT TO BLEND INTO THE CROWD...

AS TRUTH OFFICERS ARRIVE TO STOP THE RIOT, THE BATTLE SURGES TOWARDS ADAM AND REGAL. ADAM SHOOTS AT THE ONCOMING
ROBOTS, BUT THE DUO IS FORCED TO TAKE REFUGE IN A SUBTERRANEAN SEWER DUCT.
