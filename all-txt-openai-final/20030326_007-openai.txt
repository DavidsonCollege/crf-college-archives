**Smashing public chairs is so not cool**

Last week the Davidsonian reported on a fairly regular occurrence: a Davidson student taking personal initiative to benefit the entire
community.

The efforts of Mac Cowell ’06 led to 33 dark green Adirondack chairs being placed around campus, an addition that
countless students have taken advantage of as spring fever pulls us from our dorm rooms.

Two weeks after their distribution, however, the chairs are significantly fewer in number.

That’s ridiculous.

To avoid damage on the Court, the chairs were stationed up the hill. Drunk people can walk, of course, and
it can only be hoped that the damage was done under the influence.

Smashing a plastic chair while sober might indicate a serious anger management problem.

Smashing a plastic chair while drunk, however, indicates two things: one, that Davidson students can’t handle their alcohol. Partying on
a weekend night should not lead to the destruction of public property.

Two, the Code of Responsibility is not a factor in students’ weekend lives. While the veil of secrecy around Code
of Responsibility cases and sanctions is somewhat to blame, we all know the Code exists and is in effect 24/7.

Neither alcohol nor ignorance, however, deserves all the blame. Generally, Davidson students are 18-22 years old.

That’s old enough to not destroy public property, particularly when that property is the direct result of a classmate’s work.

Halfway around the world, there are a lot of 18-22 year old people trying to stay alive. They are responsible
for guns and grenades. They take orders and give orders, and they do it with the spotlight of the world
on them.

Surely a bunch of kids tucked safely away in Davidson can be responsible enough not to smash school chairs. Surely
we are old enough to take our responsibility to the campus and each other—a responsibility much lighter than some of
our peers are shouldering—with some degree of adulthood.

**The latest European trend: protesting**

In Spain, news of the first bombings of “Operation Freedom” came at the end of a national holiday and a
hell of a party. The following day, some students fought through their grogginess to crowd Madrid’s streets in protest. Spanish
polls report that overwhelming numbers form the opposition to the war; yet this is one of the few Western European
countries to stand with Bush’s coalition.

Right off, it is obvious these are not the protests of the anti-Vietnam generation; students buy 12 euro “No a
la guerra” t-shirts and occasionally break for a latte at Starbucks. These protestors also share backing from a large professional
class. Why then has the Spanish government of Jose Maria Aznar been able to stay with Bush?

Of course, there are a number of political realities separating any protest from the realization of its goals. First, politically
speaking, most protestors are unable to mount real opposition; it is perceived that they simply do not carry weight at
the polls. There is a general feeling in Spain that Aznar’s party is not playing with the same political stakes
as Britain’s PM, Tony Blair. And as long as Spanish troops stay off the front lines, things will remain the
same.

Second, cries against an immoral war for oil hit upon the root of why this war is so significant; that
is, whether for disgusting capitalistic interests or the spirit of democratic liberation, this conflict will come to shape the world’s
vision of international legitimacy.

For these protestors, they may find that in the wake of the current campaign, a messy rebuilding process combined with
immense rifts in the EU, UN, and even NATO, America’s status as the world’s sole superpower may ironically be an
effective tool for peace. Until then, protests will continue as long as they stay in touch with the latest Euro-fashion.
