### Soccer Races to 3-0-1 Start

#### Elmo paves way for new era in Davidson soccer

It has been and it will be an absolutely phenomenal year for the Davidson soccer team. For those that consider
my opening the least bit outlandish, let me pepper you with some facts.

1. The soccer team finished second in the Southern Conference last season (the highest it has finished in over 10
years) and has even more talent this year.

2. Coach Slagle was Southern Conference Coach of the Year last year and designed a rigorous summer practice schedule that
enhanced the ball skills of everyone on the team.

3. The freshmen are so good they beat the shorts off the varsity in the first scrimmage.

4. Every position on the field has at least two excellent contenders, so the game starters vary according to performance
in practice the days preceding each game. This breeds competition and competition promotes better play. Also, if a player becomes
tired or injured, the position is not jeopardized by having a “scrub” (sports-slang for horrible player) replace him.

5. I’m back on the team. The invincible, the wonderful, the magnificent ME.

With all of this in Davidson’s favor, it is no small wonder that the team is already 3-0-1. The “1”
in the last column is the result of a 2-2 tie against Warren Wilson on Saturday. We have excuses, though.
They had a six-foot-six ostrich playing defensive sweeper; any time a ball was crossed he headed it away from goal.
He could slide tackle too, and removed two Davidson players by raking his Size 14 cleats across their shins. Soccer
is a vicious game.

Davidson had over three times as many shots on goal as did Warren Wilson and earned sixteen corner kicks. (Ten
were in overtime alone.) The goals against W.W. were scored by Hall Barnett on a throw-in play and by Todd
Lambert on a long shot. They were not the most exciting part of the game, though. It came when a
W.W. player brazenly kicked Lambert in the leg for no apparent reason after a corner kick. Lambert winced and responded
quickly with a “Spinx-Linx” to the left eyebrow of the dirty opponent. A big and bearded W.W. player tackled Lambert
and chaos ensued for about ten seconds. Both were ejected, Lambert sauntered to the bench and said, “I dazed him,”
and the game continued with ten people on each side.

On Sunday the team visited Western Carolina for the first conference game of the year. Western Carolina has astroturf, loud-mouthed
fans that picked on me the entire game, and malicious players; but the Cats controlled them 1-0 in spite of
it all. Ten minutes into the second half the score was still 0-0, and Davidson had a corner kick. Chris
Roberts crossed it perfectly, and Jim Wright “Peanut” headed it back across the flow of players and into the net.
After the goal, the Catamount goalkeeper was down, injured. It seems he ran into Mike Mauzé’s elbow and fell. When
the game was over, he was still shouting obscenities at Mauzé, but so was their assistant coach. I waved “bye”
to all my fans (they hated me), gave them the number-one sign, and we hurried home.

Last week the games were at home, against Tusculum and Guilford. Davidson whipped Tusculum 3-1 with two beautiful goals by
Roberts and a “cheeky” little dance goal by Barnett. Lambert had his first two goals and Roberts another to beat
Guilford 3-2 last Wednesday. I did not score but made some beautiful decoy runs to lure defenders away from the
goal scorers.

Saturday the soccer team hosts Hampden-Sydney and promises to better their 3-0-1 (the tie was only because of the ostrich)
record.

Here is some interesting information about some of the players to help you “get to know” the team.

- No. 5 Dan Blood—“Tasmanian Devil”. Don’t let the black beard and grunts during game play fool you. He is
an animal, but only on the field. He’s sophisticated; he spent the summer in New York working for Chase Manhattan.
He drinks coffee during away games.
- No. 13 Todd Lambert. Already has 3 goals. Owner of very powerful right foot and left hook.
- No. 15 Brian Hamilton—“Gnat”. A tenacious, pesky player that rarely gets beaten.
- No. 17 Hall Barnett. The fastest player on the team. Has two goals already because he can throw his
body into “hyperdrive” against any defender in any game.
- No. 21 Me. Have not scored yet. Eagerly awaiting first goal. Have to get glory by writing about games
and including myself in the articles.
