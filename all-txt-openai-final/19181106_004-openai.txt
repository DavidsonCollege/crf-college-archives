4 The DAVIDSONIAN, November 6, 1918

WASHINGTON AND LEE HERE NEXT SATURDAY

Washington and Lee meets Davidson here next Saturday in a game that doubtless will be one of the best of
the season. Davidson has not yet had a chance to show what she has, but Saturday’s game will bring it
out. Although only four old “D” men are back this year, several good new men have shown up well and
should make a “rep” for themselves. The “Generals” have a strong team this year, although built up mostly of new
men. Last Saturday they held V. P. I. to a 13 to 0 score. As this is the first game
of the season for us, it will doubtless be well attended. Of course, every man in Davidson College and the
S. A. T. C. will be out and show some of the old-time Davidson “pep.” Back Charlie Hall up. “Buck”
Burns’ place at full is being handled well by Massey.

Washington and Lee's probable lineup has not been secured, but Davidson's team will probably be as follows:
- Crouch: Left End
- Brady: Left Tackle
- Cornelson: Left Guard
- Robbins: Center
- Robson: Right Guard
- McMaster: Right Tackle
- White: Right End
- Spann: Quarterback
- Johnson: Right Halfback
- Massie: Fullback
- McAllister: Left Halfback

Y. M. C. A. NOTES

The Y. M. C. A. at Davidson has been both appreciated and enjoyed by the entire battalion of the S.
A. T. C. unit here. The pleasure in the past has been small compared to the enjoyment expected. The reading
room has been very popular. The victrola, magazines, and games have attracted many, although the room is very small. Mr.
Moore hopes to open the large room (on the left as you enter the gymnasium) in a few days as
a recreation room. He has appealed to the student soldiers for rocking chairs and Morris chairs. The arrangement of the
quarters in the barracks is so crowded that the space scarcely permits a rocker, and by giving it to the
Y. M. C. A., which you would have been compelled to throw away, you benefit yourself as well as your
comrades, for there in the recreation room you too may enjoy it.

With great pleasure to the soldiers, Mr. Moore has announced that the “movie” machine has been shipped from Atlanta and
the arrival is expected in a few days. He also states that pictures will be shown every Tuesday and Saturday,
which will appeal to the fellows.

The Y. M. C. A. has made preparations for the strengthening of the soul as well as for the diversion
of the mind and body. On each hall, a man has been appointed to lead his comrades in the study
of the Bible as it influences the conduct and character of the true soldier. “The Soldiers’ Spirit” is the topic
of the study. These meetings are held every Sunday morning at 10 o'clock. Everyone should make it his duty to
attend these meetings.

“THE SOLDIER'S SPIRIT” TOPIC OF DISCUSSION

The Bible classes started off last Sunday at 10 a.m. with great interest and enthusiasm. About 180 men were present.
That is a very good beginning, but every man should be in one of these classes. The leaders are as
follows:
- Rumple West: 1st floor, A. G. Finley; 2nd floor, D. I. McKeithan; 3rd floor, T. H. Wilson.
- Rumple East: 1st floor, R. C. Garth; 2nd floor, F. R. Walker; 3rd floor, S. T. McCloy.
- Watts: 1st floor, J. C. Cunningham; 2nd floor, F. C. McAskill; 3rd floor, G. Lilly.
- Georgia: 1st floor, J. C. Cunningham; 2nd floor, F. C. McAskill; 3rd floor, G. Lilly.
- Chambers: 1st floor, J. C. Rogers.

The book that is being studied is “The Soldier’s Spirit.” The meetings are held every Sunday morning at 10 o'clock.
Mr. Moore is a fine leader.

DR. SHEARER CONVALESCING AFTER LONG ILLNESS

All old Davidson men will be very glad to hear that Dr. Shearer, the beloved Bible Professor and ex-president of
Davidson College, is now convalescing after a long and serious illness. Dr. Shearer paid his usual visit to Virginia last
summer in spite of the fact that he had been in especially weak condition. Early this fall he was seized
with what apparently was a malarial fever of a stubborn and baffling character. At the same time, he has had
renewed trouble with his eyesight, which has been very weak for several years past. On account of his extreme weakness,
it was feared by his physicians that he might be attacked by Spanish influenza. In his condition, such an attack
would probably have proved fatal, and consequently, he has been placed under the strictest quarantine. He is now very much
better and has been sitting up a while each day for the past week. It is hoped that he will
soon be strong enough for the quarantine to be lifted so that his friends may see him often. Dr. Shearer
has always been a true friend to the men of Davidson College, and it is safe to say that as
soon as he is able, he will be glad to talk with and advise anyone wishing to see him, whether
a new or an old man at Davidson.

Lorraine Dotson is getting on nicely at the Infirmary. He has been ill with pneumonia.

one of these meetings next Sunday morning. Mr. Moore is at the back of this and we are sure of
success because he is a
