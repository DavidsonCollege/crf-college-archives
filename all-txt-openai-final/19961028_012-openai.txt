ARTS & LIVING

Grammy-nominated guitarist strums

By MICHAEL SCHULTZ
Guest Writer

Intervarsity Christian Fellowship and the Union Concert Committee cooperated to bring Grammy-nominated (1991 and 1994) guitarist Phil Keaggy to Davidson
last Thursday evening.

He performed an entirely acoustic set of material ranging from his first recordings in 1968 to a song from his
most recent disc, 220, released earlier this month. The concert was fairly evenly divided between instrumental and vocal songs, all
of which included substantial improvisation.

Phil’s performance was marked by incredible guitar work and an unrelenting sense of humor. A trademark of his live shows
is the use of the Lexicon JamMan, a sampler which allows Keaggy to record and play back musical phrases on
the guitar. He uses this technique to create percussion loops (by beating on the instrument) and to provide supplemental guitar
and vocal parts. The effect is stunning, for lack of a better word.

Phil Keaggy performs in Love Auditorium.

Will Nolen

Everyone at the show came away with considerable respect and admiration for not only Phil’s sheer talent, but his tremendous
creativity of musical expression as well. Likewise, those in attendance received a considerable dose of Phil’s self-effacing humor, which kept
the audience thoroughly entertained between, and occasionally during, songs. The concert in Love Auditorium was attended by an audience of
about five hundred, including groups from as far away as Columbia, SC, and Asheville. For those who missed the concert
and those who would enjoy another opportunity to hear his music, Phil Keaggy will be performing at Columbia International University
in February.
