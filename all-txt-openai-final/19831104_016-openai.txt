November 7, 1983

Dear Mom and Dad,

I’m real sorry about this weekend. It’s funny — I knew that it was Parents’ Weekend, but somehow I just
didn’t remember that you were coming. Sorry about the mess in the room, too. Somebody was having a party in
mine and Joey’s room. I didn’t know about it. By the way, that guy with the beard and one earring
asleep in the corner was not me, even though it looked a little like me. He’s a senior who came
back for Homecoming. I mean, he graduated ten years ago and knew my hall counselors. He forgot his clothes so
I had to loan him some of mine. That’s why he had on that sweater you knitted for me. He
didn’t wake up when you shook him because he was real tired after playing football that afternoon. He’s pretty cool.
That was a cigarette in his hand, by the way.

Did you happen to pick up a red earring and a set of barrettes while you were there? Someone lost
them in the couch. Margaret and I spent most of Saturday night looking for them.

A bunch of campers from Camp Queens came up Friday night for the big singalong in Love Cabin. It was
keen. They sang about the Red Sky at Night and other Indian songs. I met some of the campers from
Camp Queens then, too. They're real nice and like to come up to visit us here a lot. Margaret didn’t
seem to like them much, though. She saw their purses and cigarettes and wouldn’t talk to them. Joey and I
did though, and so did a bunch of other campers. We had our own singalong later that night on the
cross-country fields. It was keen! I guess that’s why I didn’t see you Saturday morning, huh?

Anyway, I bet the awards ceremony on Saturday was nice. I really like the costumes they all wear, but I
wonder why the counselors get to wear the funny ones? Do you know? I mean, one counselor looked like he
had a throw pillow on his head. I'm sorry I didn’t get any awards. I worked real hard on my
woodworking project, but they said it didn’t look much like a whistle. The bowl — er, end was too wide.
Did you pick it up from the room? Joey and I couldn’t find it when we wanted to use it
Sunday.

Well, that’s all the news from here. I’m looking forward to seeing you over the break in two weeks. Send
money so I can get home.

Your son,
Dennis
