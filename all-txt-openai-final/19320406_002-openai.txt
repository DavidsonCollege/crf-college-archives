APRIL 6, 1932

**Imitation is the sincerest flattery—C. C. Colton.**

**PARAGRAPHICS**

After a week of holiday, the student body should feel more like getting down to the old grind and combating
the evils of “spring-fever” which are sure to tempt the unwary ones.

Congratulations to Jerome Clark and Paul Brown on their recent elections—also to the other leaders who were selected to serve
with them.

Dean Rusk seems well on the way to being on the championship lacrosse team of England. The surprising thing is
that he never played the game before his entrance to Oxford.

After fifteen years, the members of the Class of 1932, whether they realize it or not, are returning to their
last two months of educational pursuit.

R. O. T. C. students are looking forward with awe and despair to the coming inspection. The battalion is being
rapidly whipped into shape for the ordeal.

According to the announcement of E. C. Dwelle, the annual will be out earlier than usual this year. All bills
must be paid up before the book may be secured by the individual.

The Tennessee Mugwump, in its latest issue, makes apologies to the Yowl! for unintentional plagiarism. Well, accidents will happen.

**A GREAT LOSS**

With the end of the semester of this school year, Davidson loses one of her greatest characters, one of her
strongest supporters, one of her best professors; a person who has shown in a great variety of ways his interest
in her welfare. Colonel Scott came to Davidson in 1928, along with the members of the present Senior class, and
each year of his service here has added to his popularity.

Before coming to Davidson, Colonel Scott attended the Infantry School at Fort Leavenworth, having taken his undergraduate work at the
Military Academy at West Point. He has been for the last three summers the head of the summer R. O.
T. C. camp at Anniston, Ala. This is a distinct honor for an officer to have this command given him
for three successive years. When he leaves Davidson, he will enter the Army Industrial College in Washington where he will
study for a year.

It will be difficult for the government to replace Colonel Scott. He has been eminently successful in all that he
has undertaken here, and that has been a great deal. The unit has been classed as an honor unit every
year since the Colonel has been here. Davidson students recognized his services by inviting him to join Omicron Delta Kappa,
honorary leadership fraternity. It is with a feeling of great loss that Davidson bids him farewell and wishes him good
luck.

**A PLEA FOR SLEEP**

Repetition is said to be the basis of emphasis, and if this be true, perhaps this editorial will not go
the way of most editorials; for it is to be a repetition. In his editorial column of the “Yowl,” Editor
Bell recently complained of the distracting habit which certain men on the campus have of calling loudly to someone else
just at the hour when most respectable, peace-loving students are drifting into deep somnolence.

There are a great many things at which one may become irritated, but there are none which cause, at least
to this writer, more justifiable wrath. It is quite bad enough to be awakened at a decent hour in the
morning by a slowly tolling bell, but to be dragged from the joy of deep slumber at such an hour—one
feels that murder would be too good for the criminal.

It is difficult enough for students to get their work done, retire, and go to sleep, being disturbed only by
the lights and the ordinary noises of Dormitory Row; but these things are natural and apparently unavoidable. We are making
our complaint about those things—that thing—this habit of shouting to the utmost height of the vocal ability at such an
hour, and to such a peaceful, unwilling audience.

And we would not complain were these noises necessary; if there was a life and death matter of which the
recipient had to be informed, it would not be out of order to let him know about it in the
quietest way possible. But after the disturbing person has finally, after several attempts, awakened his man, and got him to
the window, he usually calls, “Go to bed!” or some other supposedly bright saying. It is so funny! The originator
of the little joke goes on his way laughing and thinking about how good and amusing life is; but what
of those men who have been so violently offended?

If this editorial ever causes one man to desist from this action, we will not think our writing was in
vain.

**Collegiate Ramblings**

J. E. Lake

**Washington and Lee**

Red Nichols and His Band have been definitely chosen as the orchestra to play for the Washington and Lee Cotillion
Club Easter dances, April 11-12. This set of dances is known as “Little Finals.” Both of these dances will be
formal. There will be a little reduction in the prices for these dances. The W. & L. Finals are not
a certainty as yet because the members of the student body won't pledge their support to them, that is, not
enough to put on the dances and not lose on them.

Wayne King (according to The Loudspeaker, a part of The Ring-tum Phi) lost two dollars recently when he got married.
He wagered that amount that he wouldn't get married before he was forty; he is thirty-one. He is now on
a tour but plays over the WEAF-NBC chain at 5:30 p.m. on Wednesdays. He is not on from Chicago at
11:45 every night; Bernie Cummings has replaced him and Ted Weems has replaced Bernie Cummings. Cummings is on at 11:45
and Weems is on at 12:15.

**Clemson**

The new commandant at Clemson for next year will be Major Thomas H. Munroe, Infantry, at present a student at
the Army War College at Washington. The Tiger put out an April Fool number, which was rather comical. Here are
some of the headlines: Peoples State Bank to Reopen at Clemson; Fliers Land in Paris and Inquire for Speakeasy; They
Are Still Drunk; Great Catastrophe at College Laundry—Cadet Receives Laundry on Time—950 Spectators Swoon.

**Georgia**

The Eighth Annual Religious Welfare Conference is to be held at Georgia today and tomorrow with Dr. George W. Truett,
pastor of the First Baptist Church of Dallas, Texas, and one of the most prominent preachers in the South, as
the chief speaker.

**V. M. I.**

Ted Weems and his famous band will furnish the music for the V. M. I. Finals in June this year.
The V. M. I. Finals are famous for getting such splendid orchestras: 1926-28 was Jan Garber; '29, Hal Kemp; '30,
Tal Henry; '31, Coon-Sanders; and now '32, Ted Weems.

**N. C. State**

Here is another school that put out an April Fool paper. It is very good; if you want some laughs
go down to the “Y” reading room and read it. For instance, there is a picture of Adolphe Menjou, the
moving picture artist, with his name being given as Major Michael Adolphe Perry. Under his name is this: “Convicted by
the Board of Trustees yesterday on charges of laziness and incompetence, the gentleman shown above was discharged.”from the teaching faculty
of State College.” There are in the United States 81 college fraternities and 34 college sororities. Canada has 23 colleges
and universities. The largest is Montreal University with 7,268 students. The oldest is the University of King’s College at Halifax,
founded in 1789.

“Of Ships & Shoes— & Sealing Wax— Of Cabbages & Kings...”

FOUND IN THE DEAD LETTER OFFICE

Rumple Dormitory, Room number one. (Room for improvement).

Deer Paw: Do you reckon granpaw thought the day would ever come when the steering wheel would be the family
circle? I shore enjoyed comin’ down home for a few daze. But a guy here made me mad tother day.
Said I come from a hick town. I ast him what that wuz. (Yu see I didn’t even know what
one was, so how could I be from one?) He said a hick town was when they painted “COME AGAIN”
on the back of the “WELCOME” sign in a town. But I thunk a while and reelized that we didn’t
have any WELCOME sign t’ home. (So how could we paint “COME AGAIN” on tother side?) He said his idea
of a hick town wuz where everybody knows whose check is good. (But we aint got any bank t’ home;
so there aint any checks.) He said I come from a one horse town. (He didn’t know that the horse
had sleeping sickness, and purty soon there wouldn’t even be one horse.) But I got it back on him, paw.
I thunk up a right pert answer (this last sentence borrowed from Ragin). I tole him he wuz even dumber
than the girl who got fired from Woolworths because she couldn't remember the prices! I tole him that if he
said what he really thought he would be speechless.

I shore did enjoy my Easter vacation with you all. I allus love to set out on the piazza and
hear the sun shinin’, and the grass growing, and the dogs bursting into barkter. But I got purty tired, too.
Dead tired. Flat tired. Bummin’ was a mess. It’s all right to walk with a suitcase. But there’s such a
thing as carrying the thing too far. Work gettin harder... nights gettin shorter... me gettin sleepier. Work pilin up on
the table... me pilin in bed. Work very much alive... me about dead. I figger that if all the boys
in college who slept in class were laid out end to end, they would be much more comfortable.

Ya know, paw, after gettin aroun a bit in the country, I have begun to believe that the only thing
left in the world that can be shocked is grain. I see in the papers where whiskers are coming back.
Shucks, that aint news. They always do. I bet Lindbergh didn’t have any trouble gettin rid of old razor blades.
I’d call his little trip a success. It’s not every trip you go on that you can throw your old
blades out the winder and then not hear from them again. By the way I heard that Lindbergh’s baby wuz
took off the other day. So I dropped him a line wishing him many happy returns. You reckon as how
he thought I wuz purt?

Say, by the way, paw. Did you hear about the one-eyed Scotchman who claimed as how they ought to sell
him a half-price ticket to the movie? (Wal, I didn’t either. Cause he never went to the movie.)

Brief pause for station announcement. Important notice. This program is coming to you from “Mac” of the “CAR-MAC-WELL” Company, in
One, Rumple. This is no joke. We frame your group pictures, chapter pictures, pictures of—well of your sisters, mottoes, et
cetera. We even framed a silhouette of Roger Hall. So you see, with the CarMacWell firm nothing is impossible. See
Bill CAR-ter, Dave Cald-WELL, or ty shelf. We got this idea of advertising from the radio. We thought you'd be
tired of the “program” anyway, so we switched to advertising. After all, though, it doesn’t matter. Cause we’re the only
ones who read the column anyway (except a few specimens like YOU). I allus thought till the other day that
GINN & COMPANY were distillers.

TOMORROW'S N. C. POEM

Here lie the bones of Johnny Jones.
He died a horrible death.
He drank a bottle of Blisterine.
And it took away his breath.

We could just print a lot of jokes, but you'd only laugh at them. I just bought a copy of
FREE WHEELING, by Ogden Nash. But doggone it, it wasn’t free!

I remain
With all my curiosity,
Cellu Lloyd
(Cousin to Harold Lloyd.)

What Do You Think?

“There is said to be enough of the old, large-sized paper money in existence to wipe out about half of
America’s national deficit,” says the Christian Science Monitor, and continues: “United States Treasury reports set the amount as $575,000,000. Nearly
three years ago all the old-sized bills were called in, and yet today more than $500,000,000 worth still are outside
those channels which would sweep them into the treasury’s waste paper baskets and its macerators.

“None of these $575,000,000 can be performing a constructive mission. Were any of them to drift into the channels of
trade, they would speedily find their way into the banks, by which they would be sentenced to the federal repository
for homeless dollars. In exchange, slimmer, more youthful bills would emerge, ready to speed up the currents of commerce. A
very few of the old-style bills may be wandering around in a circle, but in all probability the great majority
have gone into temporary retirement and need to be teased to come out and enjoy the beautiful spring sunshine. Undoubtedly
many found their way into private collections and others were destroyed in fires, but the average paper note of even
the denomination of $1 is generally on a leash if it is ever allowed far away from home.

“It is a foregone conclusion that there are persons who are acquainted with the oo of these antiques and thereby
in a position to start a movement for a national reunion of the grizzled greenbacks at the United States Treasury
building in Washington. Such a reunion would hurry the oncoming return of prosperity.”

The use of the Japanese cherry tree for ornamental purposes in this country has apparently become a sort of fad.
If any river bank, or slope along a public highway near a city is to be adorned, someone says “Japanese
cherry trees,” and that settles it. The Japanese cherry tree is a poor second to any one of various American
trees. It gives a mass of white blossoms for a few days, but the tree itself has no beauty of
form, its foliage is not beautiful through the summer, and it has no beauty of autumn coloring, no matter what
the conditions of autumn may be.

The average modern boy and girl get married with no thought of compatibility beyond a mutual dislike for fried oysters
or an appetite for salted peanuts, or a shared admiration for some movie hero, according to David Seabury, a consulting
psychologist of New York. For this reason, and for the reason that few individuals understand themselves, there is a sea
of divorce, crime, and suicide, Seabury declared.

Seabury predicted that psychology, although still immature, eventually will direct every act and progress of civilization. Speaking before the Chicago
Executive Club, he said: “Impulses have been reduced to four basic emotions or causes. They are rage, fear, sex, and
wonder. The first three are practically apparent at birth, while wonder develops within a few years. One of these emotions
is dominant in every person.

“Rage will make a great, reckless leader. Fear is found in a good, cautious business man. Ministers, doctors, nurses and
such are governed by sex, which emotion includes the desire to serve and care for persons. Scientists and abstract thinkers
are naturally dominated by wonder.”

Seabury gives the following recipe for improving the social structure: “Courses in psychology should be instituted in public schools and
the study be made compulsory from the lowest grade onward; young married couples should be given a thorough course in
parental training, and yearly examinations and classifications of all children should be made. By the latter method, criminal tendencies, irregular
thought, habits, or dominant beliefs might be curtailed or encouraged as the case may be.”

WHEN KNIGHTHOOD WAS IN FLOWER

When knighthood was in flower, in the bower in the shower,
With his true love at his side;
He forgot to note the hour of the clock up on the tower,
So her father tanned his hide.

RUMPLE REPARTEE

Cell No. One Speaking: “Whatsa matter; girl not coming?”
Cell No. Two Replying: “Aw, she’s coming, but she can’t even send a telegram without saying ‘Stop’ every sentence.”
