**Only Ichabod Knows Of Captured Corpse**

By JIM COOLEY
Associate Editor

It could have been a story straight out of the Bobbsey Twins, and yet considerable validity can be attached to
the “cadaver-in-the-column” mystery which circulated about the campus for almost 50 years after the turn-of-the-century incident in which a body
was stolen from a nearby grave shortly after burial.

In those days Davidson had a medical school and with it a demand for cadavers for anatomy class. Cadavers were
expensive and hard to find. So it is not entirely unbelievable that more than one enterprising Davidson scholar kept an
eye on the obituary column and procured his own cadaver from the neighborhood cemetery.

Agreement has never been reached as to whether the body in this instance was white or Negro, but the family
of the deceased suspected grave-robbing, opened the tomb, and found it empty. According to the story, the robbers (some sources
believe they were students, others say a professor) heard that the family was turning the case over to legal authorities
and, so the story goes, they dropped the body down into one of the hollow columns of old Chambers along
with a quantity of unslaked lime to erase the evidence.

In 1929 the trustees voted to pull down the four old columns which had stood as gaunt reminders of the
Chambers fire eight years earlier. An examination of the inside of the columns revealed no skeletons and it appeared that
the skeleton stories had simply been a hoax.

Twenty years later LeGette Blythe, foremost historian of Mecklenburg County and then a staff writer for The Charlotte Observer, added
new evidence which seemed to prove that the skeleton(s) had been removed prior to the razing of the columns. The
“Sherlock Holmes” of Blythe’s tale was Brigadier General Walter A. Dumas, ret., of San Francisco, a Davidson graduate of 1915.

His “Mr. Watson” was classmate Ernest G. Campbell. Resolved to determine the truth of the “cadaver-in-the-column” tales, they first checked
to see if there was enough oxygen in the columns and then one lowered the other to the bottom. The
first column was empty but the next two yielded a partial skeleton and a skull.

Further revelations brought to light an earlier expedition to the base of the columns. C. M. McKinnon, ‘95, in a
letter to Blythe, claimed that he and another student had discovered a skeleton in 1893 while exploring the columns. But
wherever the truth lies, the only existing proof of these episodes is a skull sawed in half and partially blackened
by fire. The skull—called “Ichabod”—now rests in the relics case at Pi Kappa Alpha house.

And, alas, there can never be any more cadavers-in-the-columns stories. Even if one of Davidson's ambitious pre-meds decided to do
some advanced research in human anatomy, he wouldn't find much of a hiding place in the new Chambers’ columns. They
are solid concrete.

**Nudist Alumnus Shunned**

By ALLEN LEWIS
Staff Writer

Almost any college can boast of its Rhodes Scholars and government leaders, but how many schools can claim the executive
secretary of the International Nudist Convention? It seems a shame that Davidson has ignored one of its most illustrious alumni:
Dr. Usley Boone.

Boone, of Brooklyn, N.Y., entered Davidson in 1899 with the class of 1903. Although he stayed for only one year
(he completed his education at Brown University), the Davidson spirit seems to have had its effect on him. After his
graduation, Boone became a Baptist minister. Apparently, the cloth did not suit him, for he discarded it and became a
nudist in 1931.

However, Boone's thoughts were not all spent on nudism; he also gave some thought to international policy. In a speech
in which he conceded defeat to his opponent in the election of the executive director of the American Sunbathing Association,
Boone argued that nudism would end all war. “It would be hard,” he said, “to tell which man was your
enemy if all the soldiers wore no clothes.”

The last statement should rank Boone along with Davidson's two other national leaders—Woodrow Wilson and Dean Rusk. Though Rusk and
Wilson are certainly more well-known, it is not every Davidson man who makes a success out of a bare existence.

**Engulfing Fire Fortified Spirit**

By JIM COOLEY
Staff Writer

It was probably the most spectacular fire anyone has ever seen in this part of Mecklenburg County. People miles away
could see the smoke and flames, but there was nothing anyone could do to save what had been the most
imposing college building in the South.

The date was Nov. 2, 1921, and the event was the fire which almost totally destroyed old Chambers Building. Discovered
at 5 a.m., the alarm was quickly given, but the flames rapidly devoured the pine timber which formed the basic
building material. A bucket brigade of students and townspeople was quickly formed but there was little they could do except
to keep the fire from spreading to nearby buildings.

Many students saved most of their personal belongings by putting them in trunks and rolling the trunks down the stairs
or by throwing them out of the windows to students waiting below to carry them to safety. But the loss
was still great—an estimated $250,000, of which $100,000 was recovered by insurance. Destroyed by the fire were the physics laboratories
and lecture room, the college museum, an old library, five classrooms, and dormitory space which accommodated 135 men.

As the fire died down, the bugler sounded assembly and President W. J. Martin declared, according to THE DAVIDSONIAN of
the following week, “The spirit that had made Davidson one of the strongest colleges of the South would assert itself
in the midst of the catastrophe and that an even greater Davidson would arise from the ashes of Old Chambers
building.”

President Martin even pledged that classes would not be interrupted past that morning, a pledge which no doubt warmed the
hearts of those Davidson men of old who, like their counterparts of today, would rather attend class in the crisp
December air than miss a single lecture. The students then stood with bared heads and sang the school alma mater,
“O Davidson.”

**Obelisks Shadow Davidson’s Dead**

By JOHN PANCAKE
Copy Editor

It has been rumored that there are Davidson students who can hardly wait to leave Piedmont North Carolina. But, there
are some alumni who have had roots in Davidson for over a century. They may be found in the cemetery
on North Main Street.

Obelisks stand watch over Davidson students who remain in the shade of the town's water supply. The monuments twenty yards
to the left of the water tower were erected by the dead students’ literary societies, the Eumanean or Philanthropic. The
students were buried in Davidson because there was no way to ship their corpses home. Later it was possible to
send the bodies home by train, but Davidson students had been dying in the days before the railroads reached Davidson.

**Wilson Not Outstanding**

By ROBBIE HOOKER
Editor-in-Chief

Woodrow Wilson, who became a scholar, diplomat, governor, and 28th President of the United States, was pretty much a nobody
as a Davidson College student. Despite the fact he spent only a year here, compiling a rather mediocre record, Wilson
is nonetheless the college's ranking famous son. Attempts to dethrone him have been futile.Ago, for instance, there was a movement
to install in his place Secretary of State Dean Rusk, a bona fide graduate and BMOC of the first order.
This mutinous movement was quelled, however, and Rusk’s popularity, tainted by LBJ and Vietnam policies, has since fallen on evil
days. Then there are always a few irreverent souls leveling various charges against Wilson: that he couldn't take it and
dropped out, that he was kicked out, that he was profane, that he was a fly, that he wasn’t a
fly, that he was lazy, etc., etc. For each charge, however, Davidson divines have always provided an answer, and Wilson's
place on the historical marker across from the post office ("... studied here 1873-1874") seems secure again—at least for the
time being.

Thomas Woodrow Wilson—he was called Tommy here—came to Davidson in the fall of 1873, scrawny, shy, and so ill-prepared for
college work that he spent most of the first semester on academic probation. Precisely why Wilson came here, like why
he left, is not clear, and the college library's extensive collection of Wilson biographies, Wilson writings, Wilson clippings, and Wilson
what-nots does not say. As a student, Wilson apparently did the things most students then did. He studied some, read
a lot, took long walks, played for the freshman baseball team, and joined the Eumenean Literary Society.

As a baseball player, Wilson was something less than a star. The captain of the team, Robert Glenn—who was to
become governor of North Carolina—reportedly told him he was "too damn lazy." The fact was, though, Wilson's health was probably
too delicate for the tiring sport. And it was his health—not the pressure or expulsion—that compelled him to leave school
just before final examinations. He didn't come back either. After staying out of school for 15 months, he went to
Princeton to finish his undergraduate career. But the legend has grown, and Wilson's rather abrupt departure has been surrounded by
fancy and folklore ever since.

Most persistent has been the story, undoubtedly the creation of book-weary students, that Wilson flunked out. Not so, reply his
admirers. A Thomas Wilson did flunk out about that time, but he was a Thomas A. Wilson. And to another
charge—that Wilson was "profane and vulgar"—they point to the minutes of the Eu Society, which show Wilson leading the devotions.

"Faculty of Davidson College hereby recommends to The Trustees of Davidson College that the prohibition upon dancing on the Davidson
campus be abolished." Such was part of the argument of the faculty's request in May 1943, for the trustees' approval
of dancing on campus. Does the argument sound familiar? The action that followed was familiar also—it was almost a year
before the first college-recognized dance was allowed in the town of Davidson and almost two years before a dance was
actually held on campus.

Davidson students today often find their social environment drab. By comparison with the austere days of the past, however, today's
social life is full indeed. During the 19th Century, the Eumenean and Philanthropic literary societies controlled practically all extracurricular activity.
There was no effective student body organization until after 1900, but the societies expelled men from membership for "intoxication" and
"lying to the faculty." Expulsion from the society was very serious. Davidson’s school colors were pink and blue, with Phi's
color blue and Eu's pink. They were incorporated in the college's first yell: "Rah-Rah-Rah, Run-Run-Run, Pink-and-Blue, Davidson."

The social life of Davidson revolved almost exclusively around the campus before the War of Northern Aggression. Students were often
invited to dine at nearby plantations and were never hesitant to go, since such occasions were infrequent and sometimes allowed
them the pleasure of female companionship, something the students of that age were as anxious for, apparently, as the students
of today. Recording her remembrances of bygone days, the wife of a college professor, Mrs. Anne Simpson, described social life
at the college during reconstruction as "almost nil... The students’ lives were very monotonous."

The principal deficiency in the social realm during the '20s and '30s was a scarcity of girls or "ladies," as
they were always called by proper Davidsonians. The Gay Nineties brought better times with more girls in town than ever
before. The first Davidson College dance was held in April 1944, in the high school gym, and the first dance
on campus was held in February 1945 in the gym, now the student union. "And so," wrote Dr. Chalmers G.
Davidson, "to the tunes of 'I Dream of You,' 'Always,' 'More and More,' and 'Rum and Coca Cola,' Davidson College
began to sin to music."

The tracks to Davidson were not laid until 1860, just in time to be torn up by invading federal troops.
It was not until 1870 that the tracks were in for good. After that, students were sure that if they
died at school, they could leave Davidson in body as well as spirit. The Davidson student of yesteryear was not
only buried differently than his modern successor, he died differently. One James A. Hart, Class of 1841, died of a
liver ailment in 1843. His last days were recorded for posterity in an obituary by the Phi society. "He solicited
many of them (his friends), at various times to read portions of the Holy Writ and sing the praises of
God who had softened his dying pillow... Facing death calmly, he frequently reminded them of the sinful consequences of neglecting
the Bible recitations and sabbath services. Finally, his soul, resigned and at peace with God, took her flight to that
undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns." And that’s how one faces eternity in Davidson.

Morrison Clan’s History Fertile
By ALLEN LEWIS
Staff Writer

Davidson is rich in southern history. Nowhere is this more in evidence than in the family of the Rev. Robert
Hall-Morrison, founder and first president of Davidson. Morrison had six daughters, all of whom married men who were to become
famous throughout the South. The oldest daughter, Isabella, married Daniel H. Hill, who was then a professor of mathematics at
Washington College—later Washington and Lee University—and who became famous as the Gen. Hill of the Confederate army. Harriet, the first
woman in the country to be granted a patent on an architectural design for a hexagonal house, married James Patton
Irwin, a successful businessman in Mobile, Alabama. Irwin was the only one of the Morrison sons-in-law who had money before
the Civil War. A family story has it that Mrs. Morrison always referred to him as "Mr. Irwin."

Eugenia became famous as the wife of Rufus Barringer, a lawyer from Concord who rose to the rank of general
in the Civil War. After the war, the Barringers resided in Charlotte, where he resumed his law practice, later serving
in the state legislature. The most famous of the matches began when Anna visited her sister Isabella and her husband
Gen. Hill. There she met Thomas J. Jackson, professor of mathematics at the Virginia Military Institute. It must have been
love at first sight, for soon after Anna became the wife of Thomas J. Jackson, better known as Gen. Stonewall
Jackson of the Confederate Army. After her husband’s death, she lived in Charlotte until her death, when she was given
the final honor of being one of the few women given military funerals.

Susan married Alphonse Avery, a Morganton lawyer who rose to the rank of major during the war. After the war,
he resumed his practice and later became a supreme court judge. The last Morrison girl to marry was Laura. She
married Col. John E. Brown, a lawyer in Charlotte. Col. Brown served several terms in the house of representatives in
Raleigh and later was solicitor of the criminal court of Mecklenburg. He also served as a trustee of the general
assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States.
