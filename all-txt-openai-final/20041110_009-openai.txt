**Neighborhood man caught buying alcohol for student**

Recently, a scandal has surfaced concerning a member of the Davidson community. As stated by Town of Davidson Police Department reports, noted sketchy guy Raymond Dobbs, 52, was recently given a summons for providing alcohol to an underage student, Jon Brown ’08.

According to sources within the Town Police, Dobbs allegedly dropped off a cooler full of beer and hard liquor outside of Brown’s room on second Belk on Friday night. Brown said that the cooler and its contents were a gift to congratulate him on accepting his bid to the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. “Dobbs was an SAE when he was in college, and he was happy for me,” said Brown. “I don’t see what the big deal is.”

The cooler had Brown’s name written on it in large letters and a note, “I advise you to get [expletive deleted]-faced. Your frat brother, Ray Dobbs.” The illicit transaction was discovered when Ralph McClain ’06, the hall counselor on second Belk, informed Campus Safety about the cooler full of beer in the hallway. Two officers removed the alcohol, gave Brown an alcohol citation, and informed the Town of Davidson Police about the incident, who then gave Dobbs a summons at his house for providing alcohol to a minor.

Many claimed that this was not an isolated incident. Said Peter Wilton ’05, “Mr. Dobbs was always hanging around campus my freshman year, and while he was definitely a nice guy, he was a little sketchy. When we would walk by his house on Main Street he kept trying to get us to play Beirut on his ping-pong table on his porch. I had to excuse myself after he brought out the beer bong, because it was just too awkward. The strangest thing was that he gave his expired license to one of my hallmates who looked like him so that he could buy all the beer he wanted himself.”

Claire Nillon ’06 agreed that Dobbs was always quick to provide alcohol to underage students. “Jon Dobbs is such a cool guy! He would always sneak my friends and me into the Brickhouse and buy us all a round of beers. And, one time I paid him to pick me up a handle of Aristocrat, and he came back with a bottle of Stoli instead. How sick is that?”

Dobbs, a resident of Davidson since 1994, moved here from Durham, NC after administrators at Duke University became suspicious of his presence on their campus. “He was always hanging around during freshman orientation talking to the new students,” said Duke Dean of Student Life Mark Simms. “Once we started asking him what he was doing on our campus I think he got scared and took off and we never heard from him again.”

Dobb’s move to Davidson received mixed reactions from some students. Bill Goldman ’07 said, “Dobbs was pretty cool when I first saw him hanging around the Union. He offered me a smoke and we talked a little. But when I started seeing this 50-year-old guy trying to dance with my girlfriend at SAE parties I got a little turned off. I mean, who does he think he is trying to hook up with my girl.”

Dobbs’ well-known antics bothered many of his neighbors in town as well. Explained one resident of Davidson who asked to remain anonymous, “I have always found that man to be repugnant. He would always be flirting with students, and the bass from the rap music continually playing on his stereo would shake my whole house. Trust me, we have had rumors about impropriety from Mr. Dobbs, but we would always look the other way because he always kept his lawn clean and took out...his trash on time. Still, I thought the College should have done something when I heard he was found passed out in the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity on the day of the Spring Frolics last year.” Dobbs has a court date at the Davidson Town Courthouse on January 23, 2005.

Young Democrat disillusioned with Americans’ political knowledge

Young Democrat, Megan Noble ’08, was excited about voting in her first election last Tuesday. Her excitement dissipated, however, as the night wore on, and the election results unfolded. “I couldn’t believe my eyes,” Noble commented. “How could a majority of the citizens actually vote for Bush?”

Noble had cast her ballot earlier in the day at the Davidson City Hall for the Democratic candidate John Kerry. The Republican and incumbent president George W. Bush, however, was the man who received the needed 270 electoral votes to win the election and the office of President. All of this was, of course, to the dismay of Noble and her fellow Young Democrats.

Said Noble, “I was so pumped for the election. The pre-election polls had John Kerry up by a number of percentages. I thought for sure we would be celebrating in a new, better America by this point, but as it turned out, we are stuck in the same crappy America for four more years.”

Noble even questioned the decision-making abilities of some who voted. “This was the most important election of our lifetime. I can’t believe that we had the chance to vote an evil tyrant out of office and install someone who could completely turn America around, but we blew it.”

Noble even suggests she may have become disillusioned with the whole American democratic process. “If you think about it,” she said, “it’s not very fair at all. I researched the campaign issues of both sides. I watched all the debates. I watched hours upon hours of CNN’s election coverage. I’m even in the Intro to American Politics class. I tried to gather all the information possible about the candidates and the issues at hand, in order to make my vote an informed vote. However intelligent my vote might be though, it could simply be cancelled out by some hick on the other side of the state who only votes along his party line or likes Bush’s smile. How is that fair? I feel utterly defeated.”

“While I was walking out of Chambers the other day,” recalled Noble, “I heard some kid talking to his friend. He asked him, ‘who are you going to vote for tomorrow?’ The friend said, ‘I’m not sure, I’ll probably just flip a coin about it tonight.’ It’s people like him that allowed Bush to sneak into office again. Why can’t people just get it into their heads that Bush and his policies are a cancer on this nation? If everyone had only researched the issues more, like I did, they would have doubtlessly voted for change. I mean look at the city of Seattle, it has the highest high school graduation rate in the country, and its voters strongly supported Kerry. If you look at the average IQ scores of all the states, the top 16 all voted for Kerry while the bottom 25 voted for Bush. It is the ignorant voters that may have sentenced us to another four years in the dark age.”

Noble was not alone in her sentiment that perhaps the American voters did not vote intelligently in the election. Young Democrats President Jim Spicer ’05 once had as his away message, “If Bush wins this election, I’m moving to Canada after I graduate.” The British liberal newspaper The Daily Mirror ran a headline the day after the election titled, “How can 59,054,087 people be so DUMB?”

Noble also believed that the Davidson students who supported Bush were not as intelligent or informed about politics as she. “Have you seen the results from the Dean Rusk international awareness test? Our class average was 59 percent! I bet the Bush supporters were the ones who brought down the average. If they had any idea of what the world thinks of Bush, then they definitely would not have voted for him.”

She continued, “And, did you see the results from the political survey? I bet every single person who did not know how many terms a president could serve is a Republican. And the five percent who did not know what Dick Cheney's position is? Well, they probably voted for Bush/Cheney because they did not know that guy was the Vice President! People should really have to take one of those tests and get a passing grade before being allowed to vote.”
