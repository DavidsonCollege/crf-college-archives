THE DAVIDSONIAN

Human rights activist, Nobel Peace Prize nominee, and winner of the Rafto Prize for Human Rights, Rebiya Kadeer, visited Davidson last Tuesday to shed light on the struggle between the Chinese government and her people, the Uyghur of East Turkestan. The Summer Olympics and conflict in Tibet have drawn international attention to some of the human rights struggles in the People’s Republic, but there is much more to learn about the realities of human rights in China.

Speaking through a translator, Rebiya Kadeer explained to the crowd that the Uyghurs of East Turkestan have a distinct language, culture, and history. Their homeland was annexed by the Chinese in 1949 with support from Russia, the year after the Chinese annexed Tibet. Their land represents one-sixth of Chinese territory and is rich in natural resources; more specifically, rich in oil, a commodity that is extremely important to a nation experiencing rapid economic and industrial growth.

Turkestan’s annexation came with a promise to the Uyghur people that they would remain autonomous and would be permitted to continue on with their language and culture. Kadeer explained that in 1954 wealthy Uyghurs were targeted, and nearly 60,000 people were thrown in jail with the promise that the poor would lead better lives after the rich were gone. Several years later, the Cultural Revolution swept through China, and in an effort to crush competing cultural values, the educated people of the Uyghur population were thrown in jail. After some time, many were released and the Uyghurs were promised a better, more secure future.

Kadeer explained that she benefited from the new leadership and this promise of a better life. She was able to start her own business and was named the seventh wealthiest person in China in the 1990s. However, the policies of the government once again changed quickly, and the Uyghurs were then labeled as separatists and radical Islamists by the government. The effects of such oppression were also being felt inside the community. After 1987, many Uyghurs began leaving their Uyghur societies and resorted to crimes such as pickpocketing and prostitution. Young people were continuously targeted. Private religious schools were closed, and teachers from Chinese schools became the head of Uyghur schools.

Kadeer herself was jailed by the government in 1999 and was sentenced to eight years in prison through secret government trials. She first broke with the government in 1998 when she refused to denounce her husband for his negative statements against the Chinese government and their oppressive policies towards the Uyghur people. Her first two years in prison were served in solitary confinement without any medical treatment. Kadeer shared her story with the crowd, describing that she made it through when “[I] imagined that I could fly away like a butterfly or a bird.” She was released in 2005 after strong pressure from international and human rights communities.

The Uyghurs are still struggling and living under oppression. Kadeer shared that during the Olympics “the young Uyghurs were forced to go to jail worrying that they would cause trouble during the Olympics.” Police walked the streets during that time with dogs, threatening people to demote chaos and violence from the Uyghurs. However, Kadeer and many like her continue to share the story of the Uyghurs around the world. When a student asked what individual Americans can do, Kadeer said that young people should visit East Turkestan and return home to publicize the harsh realities of the Uyghur people, writing letters to Congressmen and government officials demanding that the U.S. take action.

As the environment is an important issue for our generation and the college in its Year of Sustainability, in this election year it is important to understand the environmental policies of both presidential candidates. Democratic Presidential candidate Barack Obama proposes an environmental plan that calls for a reduction of carbon emission levels to 80 percent of the 1990 levels by 2050 through a market-based cap-and-trade system. This system would create a national carbon emissions cap...

and then divide the cap into individual allowances. Companies would be free to auction and purchase allowances. Other policies devoted to climate change include promises to invest $150 billion over 10 years in advanced energy technologies, including the creation of a Green Jobs Corps and the development of advanced vehicles made of lightweight materials and with new engines. In order to advance these policies, Obama also hopes to re-engage with the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and confront deforestation worldwide. Obama has experience with the issues of air and water quality through his Senate committee position on the Environmental and Public Works committee. He plans to continue his support of the Clean Air Act and opposition to mercury poisoning. His clean water policies include continuing support for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund, which funds wastewater treatment, nonpoint source pollution control, and watershed and estuary management in order to improve water quality. In addition, he plans on restoration work in wetlands and the Great Lakes. Obama dedicates part of his environmental policy to the improvement of health in communities, including through environmental justice programs. This commitment includes aid to low-income communities in addressing environmental concerns and providing grants to small companies to help improve their environmental policies. Obama will support regional food networks and organic and sustainable agricultural practices through USDA policy changes. A final area that Obama includes in his environmental policy is the preservation of land through national parks and forests.

Republican Presidential candidate John McCain agrees with the “Cap and Trade” approach to limiting our greenhouse gas emissions. This would allow a gradual transition away from greenhouse gases to more renewable resources. As President, McCain would work to set a timetable for the reduction of our emissions. By 2012, his plan would cut greenhouse gas emissions to the 2005 levels and by 2050, emissions would be at 66% of 2005 levels. Under McCain’s cap-and-trade plan, small businesses would be exempt from emissions limits. John McCain recognizes climate change as a threat and believes that the United States should lead the world in addressing climate concerns, through work with the United Nations and the international community to combat the issue. He also believes that the approach should spur economic growth. An integral part of McCain’s energy plan is the need for independence from foreign oil. McCain plans to reduce our reliance on foreign oil by investing in alternative fuels such as nuclear, clean coal, wind, hydroelectric, solar, natural gas, and bio-fuel. McCain supports exploring domestic oil and natural gas supplies on the Outer Continental Shelf to allow the United States to access 77 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. As President, McCain would commit during his presidency two billion dollars annually to exploring clean coal technology and would work to build 45 new nuclear power plants by 2030 to decrease American reliance on foreign oil. McCain also supports encouraging American automakers to make more fuel-efficient vehicles. He would provide a $5,000 tax credit to each customer that bought a zero-emission vehicle. McCain would also propose a $300 million prize to encourage the development of a more effective battery for use in hybrid or electric automobiles.

As environmental interns, Rachel Anderson ’11 and Peter Hansel ’09 aim to help bring environmental awareness to the Davidson College community. Sustainability on campus and environmental politics are just a few of the environmental issues pertaining to the Davidson student body.

There will be an opportunity for people to publicly humiliate the Uyghurs by taunting them, laughing at them, and humiliating them,” Leonard said. She noted that Kadeer’s presentation was extremely informative and moving. Kadeer ended by sharing a final thought on the state of the Uyghur people. “Our God-given freedom has been taken away. Our God-given right has been taken away,” Kadeer said. “We decided to stand up for it. We are rising up around the world to lift our voices.”
