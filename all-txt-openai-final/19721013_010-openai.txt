**THE LEADER OF THE PACK**

Two Davidson harriers move to edge out runners from The Citadel.

**Ricky Bell: ‘Best In 10 Years’**

By MARK CONNORS

The Davidson track and cross-country teams are very fortunate to have sophomore Ricky Bell, probably the best distance runner to come to Davidson in a long time, according to Track and Cross Country Coach Sterling Martin. Bell came to Davidson with a long list of achievements. During his high school years at Woodberry-Forest School, he dominated the distance events from the 880 to the two mile and was also Woodberry’s premier cross-country man. His senior year, Bell won the Virginia private school mile championship with an impressive 4:24.

Bell's reason for coming to Davidson was that he was “impressed by the people concerned with Davidson, most especially Coach Martin." This admiration for the Cat's cross-country and track coach has made Bell probably the most dedicated runner at Davidson, according to his teammate. He has already asserted himself as Davidson's premier miler and cross-country runner. Along with what Martin considers a fine 4:23.9 mile last year, Bell was elected most valuable player for the cross-country. Although he was “extremely happy” about the award, Bell has encountered some added pressure as a result of this early merit.

**Tennis Team Selected**

With many returnees from last year’s squad, the tennis team at Davidson College should prove to be even better than last year. “We will definitely be stronger than last year,” commented coach Harry Fogleman. “We have some good additions, plus some good returning lettermen.”

Leading the corps of experienced players is David Weaver, who won the Southern Conference singles championship the previous season. Bill Allen comes back after finishing second in the number two singles. Gary Bressler, who holds the number five singles title, is also returning. Fogleman is high on Hi Lankenau, who is back from abroad. He is termed a “fine doubles player.” Kevin Menton and Maarten Ruys are two foreign netters that impress Fogleman.

“We have a lot of work to do on the doubles,” said Fogleman. “We were weak there last year.” One doubles combination will probably be Weaver and Ruys, while Allen and Menton should pair off as another. The rest of the squad includes Rich Quimbly, Bill DuPont, and John Mitchell. One other spot has yet to be determined.

**Fall To Citadel, Wake Forest**

After an encouraging win against Richmond, the cross-country team faltered with losses to The Citadel and Wake Forest. However, the harriers hope to reverse this trend when they meet Campbell and St. Andrews this Saturday.

The Davidson cross-country team defeated Richmond on Oct. 2 after their initial loss to Furman. Team front runner Rick Bell said, “It was the best team effort since I've been here.” Coach Sterling Martin was very encouraged by the outcome and said, “It was our first Southern Conference win in a long time and it showed me that we're stronger down the line.” The Davidson runners placed five men in low scoring positions to defeat the Spiders 24-32.

After only one year of experience, he is considered by his teammates as the team leader along with Captain Ron Clark. To cope with pressure from both track and school, Bell said that he has had to develop a “sense of priorities.”is probably much more enjoyable than schools that rely on scholarships for their track program,” Bell said. “If we can keep more upperclassmen on the team, it would make for a stronger, more mature program," he said. “In three or four years, people will be talking about Davidson where they weren't before,” he said.

Although Bell is somewhat reserved about his running ability, his teammates are more open about his talent. Captain Ron Clark called Bell a “strong competitor” and is in full agreement with Martin's statement that “Ricky is the best distance runner to come to Davidson in 10 years.”

Davidson dropped meets to The Citadel and Wake Forest. The Citadel defeated Davidson 16-39 in Davidson's first run on their home course. Martin said, “The Citadel ran well as a team and had three men that were particularly strong.” Davidson dropped another to Wake Forest last Monday. According to captain Ron Clark, “Wake surprised us. It was the first time they ran as a team. It was also the best team Wake has had in two years.”

Although Davidson lost by 23 points, Coach Martin was very encouraged. “As far as our training is coming, it was the best run we've made. I was particularly impressed by the freshmen,” he said. Martin was pleased with the performances of Steve Scroggs, Bill Cole, Chuck Sudetic, and Jesse Smith. The team was also pleased with their performances. “We had five guys under thirty minutes,” commented Ricky Bell.

This Saturday, Davidson will travel to St. Andrews where they will run a tri-meet with St. Andrews and Campbell. Martin felt the two teams probably would not be too strong at this point and added, “If their teams are anything like in the past, we should come home with a couple of medals.”

Besides the tri-meet this weekend, Martin and the cross country team are looking forward to Monday's meet with VMI and W&L. VMI seems to be on a level with Davidson at this time, Martin said. They recently defeated Richmond by a score very similar to the Davidson-Richmond score. The tri-meet will be held Monday at Davidson at 4 p.m.

backfield man for Davidson. Quarterback Scotty Shipp will be called upon to direct the attack. His passing effort Saturday was a tremendous advantage to the Wildcats. The visitors will most likely have to cope with a dual-powered machine harboring a great degree of potential that the Davidson supporters are hoping will be unleashed.

“We only want the boys to give their all like they did against Appalachian,” Fagg suggested. “In that sense this game is no more important than any other game. We just want to be the best. We think we can.”

A win would end a long drought for the Cats at home. It would also stop the Paladins’ victory streak over Davidson. In 1970, Davidson dropped a close 31-28 decision, but last year Furman swamped the Cats, 41-6. A victory will also run Davidson's Southern Conference record to 2-0-1, placing them higher in the standings.
