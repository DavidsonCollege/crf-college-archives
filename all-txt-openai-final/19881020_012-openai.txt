FOOTBALL, from page 8

Wright scored on a two-yard run in the third quarter and Ralph Isernia took a reverse 20 yards for the second Davidson touchdown to bring the Cats within a touchdown and an extra point of a tie. However, the Cats’ last opportunity for a victory or a tie failed. With first and ten from their own 36, the Cats were unable to mount a drive and the Quakers took over on downs four plays later. With an 0-6 record, Davidson closes out the season with four of its toughest games against Colgate, Bucknell, East Tennessee State, and the number seven team in I-AA, Lafayette.

CROSS-COUNTRY, from page 8

Cornish agrees, adding that “we stress running our best races at the end of the season.” Andrew will try to prepare his teams for competition in the largest of all the NCAA regions with the remaining meets of the regular season, the next of which is Saturday, October 29 at Davidson. The Wildcats will host Brevard, Emory & Henry, J.C. Smith, Lenoir-Rhyne, St. Francis, and Wofford. The women start at 10 a.m. on the field hockey field with the men following at 10:45. By the time the Regionals roll around, Andrew is counting on the fact that his runners will have learned from their limited experiences and the Wildcats’ youthful Achilles’ heel will have disappeared. “We have the nucleus for two good teams over the next few years with all of the freshmen that we have.”
