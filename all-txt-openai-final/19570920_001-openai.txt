**Eta Alpha Chapter Organizes Here**

Eta Alpha (pledged to Sigma Nu), Davidson's newest social fraternity, was organized this summer and will begin a full schedule of activities this fall. As an affiliate chapter of Sigma Nu, Eta Alpha, with a current membership of seventeen upperclassmen, is planning to rush 180 freshmen for its first pledge class.

**A PLACE ON COURT**

The former Daggy house on North Main Street has been refurnished by Eta Alpha and is being operated as a combination boarding house and meeting house for the fraternity until a house is ready for them on the new fraternity court. Officers of Eta Alpha are: Walter O’Briant, Commander; Fred Landis, Recorder-Treasurer; Gippy Reid, Rush Chairman; Burwell Shore, IFC Representative; and Dr. George Labban, Jr., Faculty Advisor. Other brothers are: Bob Baldwin, Pete Bethea, Bill Carr, Tony Huggins, Tom Kernan, Calvin McGehee, James Moore, Lawrence Moore, Stacy Robinson, Jay Welch, Edward Wilson, and Felix Yarboro.

**FOUNDED IN 1870**

Sigma Nu was founded in 1870 at Virginia Military Institute in Lexington, Virginia. Eta Alpha plans to begin petitioning for a Sigma Nu charter soon after Rush Week and hopes to become in early spring the Eta Alpha Chapter of Sigma Nu and Davidson's twelfth national social fraternity.

**NOTICE TO FRESHMEN**

Special meeting for everyone who wants to work on the DAVIDSONIAN this Sunday night. In the Bive Room of the College Union at 8:45 (after Vespers).

**Rush Week Will Begin Monday**

Rush Week will officially begin Monday, September 23, and will continue through Pledge Day, Saturday, September 28. Freshmen receiving date cards will confirm the dates listed with each fraternity on Monday, September 23, from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Freshmen are asked to remain in their rooms during these hours Monday.

**CONFIRMATION RULES**

Confirmation of dates Thursday and Friday, the last two days of rushing, will take place in this manner: The rushees will place the date card which he has received from the fraternity inviting him to return, with the dates he wishes to accept clearly marked, in the lobby of Chambers Building by 12:00 noon, Thursday, September 26. A period of silence for the Freshman Class will occur from the end of the last date period Friday night until pledging or 5:00 p.m. Saturday. Formal pledging will take place Saturday, September 28, between the hours 2:00—5:00 p.m.

**RUSH DEFINITION**

Both Freshmen and upperclassmen are again reminded of the definition of Rushing: “any word or act of an active member, pledge, or alumnus of any signatory chapter which tends, or is calculated to favorably impress a rushee of that chapter or any member thereof, to secure dates with a rushee for that chapter or otherwise to influence him to it.” All rushing is limited to the town of Davidson and no fraternity man can during the rush period pay a rushee’s way to the show, buy him refreshments or in any way provide set-ups. The penalty for so-called “dirty rushing” is a $50.00 fine for the fraternity involved. Any rushee violating the regulations regarding Rushing will render himself ineligible to join or be pledged by any fraternity at Davidson College.

**SAYS PIETENPOL**

Acting President Pietenpol addressed the entire student body for the first time yesterday. He devoted his major attention to the introduction of Davidson's new faculty and to a few words of welcome to everyone. As to the question of who would be the next permanent president of Davidson College, Dr. Pietenpol would only say that the Trustee committee which was screening candidates “was not too close,” but he added, “It certainly is my hope that we have a President soon.” Dr. Pietenpol also brought the student body up-to-date on President Emeritus Cunningham. He said that the former president of Davidson would have his office at the First Presbyterian Church in Charlotte until the office in the new Wachovia Bank Building is completed (Dr. Cunningham’s present official title is the Director of the Presbyterian Foundation).

A current issue in Davidson politics died peacefully last week when a Charlotte direct line was installed in the Student Union. Four years ago Floyd Feeny began the cry for the direct line in his successful campaign for student body president and the issue has been used regularly since.

**CONNECTION SUCCEEDS**

D. Grier Martin and the Student Council succeeded in getting the line connected late last week. It will be open to students from 4:30 p.m. to 12:00 midnight on weekday afternoons and noon to midnight on Saturday and Sunday. The administration will use the phone during the day.

**No Word On Successor; Hopes For Action Soon**

**SMYTH**

Ross Smyth, President of the Student Body, spoke in Chapel today. Smyth, after dismissing the freshmen, read the Student Body Regulations and the Honor Code to the upperclassmen (The Class of 1961 heard them during orientation). The platform was then turned over to this year’s Court of Control Judge, Phil Lewis, who outlined the part the upper three classes would play in this year's Court activities.

**COUNCIL TO REGULATE**

The Student Council will regulate students' use of the line. They hope students themselves will limit calls to five minutes so the waiting lines already present will never be long. If students can cooperate, the council will need to provide no further regulation.

DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N. C. FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 1957

**CATS MEET CATAWBA TONIGHT NO. 1**

**And Fraternity Court Construction Begins**

**Houses Will Be Ready For Use Next September**

Work has begun on the new Davidson fraternity court. Construction began last August on the 12 new houses designed to meet the expanding needs of the Davidson social fraternities. Plans were concretely determined only last spring, and Mr. D. Grier Martin, Treasurer of the College, looks forward to their definite completion in time for next fall. Mr. Martin called attention to the individual cost per house of $30,000. The completed project will entail funds in excess of $400,000.

**ADEQUATE SPACE**

The houses are designed to adequately support the present emphasis of the student body.Upon the fraternity system, each house will have two large rooms, one of which will be primarily used for eating, and the other for chapter purposes. Although the basic exteriors will be similar with three variations in porch design, setting them apart, the separate fraternities will provide their own interior furnishing in keeping with their traditions and particular tastes.

HOUSE PLANS
Each house will have a large living room, dining room, basement, and patio. In addition, there will be a kitchen and quarters for the house mother. Preliminary plans have been announced for a drawing to determine the individual locations of the several fraternities. Each location will be placed in a hat, and a representative from each fraternity will draw for its position. This method determined the original positions in the present fraternity court.

Phil Lewis, assisting him will be senior members Charlie Stowe, Recorder, Fritz Russell, and Dave Fagg. Junior members are Craig Wall and Vernon Broyles. George Hart and Larry McNeil are the sophomores. Lewis said that the purpose of the Court is to introduce new members into a select group. In any such group, new members are not admitted to full privileges without a period of probation. Many of the Davidson traditions and freshman regulations may seem unimportant to the Class of 1961. But by enforcing these rules, the Court hopes to impress the freshmen with the important fact that they have not yet been accepted. The members of the Court are convinced that its function is worthwhile. This means that they will do their job without any apologies, said Lewis.

Davidson is welcoming, along with 250 new freshmen, eleven new members of the faculty and College staff. Two Davidson-UTS graduates will enter the Bible department. Reverend Woodrow McKay and the Reverend John B. Evans will teach Freshman and Sophomore Bible Courses. Mr. McKay will serve as a visiting instructor and live in the College Apartments. Mr. Evans lives with his family in the College Apartments. Mr. McKay will serve until the beginning of the second semester of the school year 1957-58. He stated that the Court will be reasonable but will exercise without let-up its duty to the student body.

College Will Spend Over $700,000 On New Buildings
Treasurer D. Grier Martin announces that construction on a new post office building and a new wing for the library is scheduled to begin this week.

DR. BLAKE
Blake Is Guest Sunday Evening

Dr. Blake was scheduled to be the principal speaker at the last year but was unable to make the trip. An advocate and principal spokesman of American Protestantism, he is a graduate of Princeton University. In the field, he has served as a missionary-teacher to India. Dr. Blake will speak on “Casual Christianity” and, immediately following the service, will be in the Student Lounge for discussion.

Plans Court Program
Phil Lewis, Judge of the Court of Control, has expressed his hopes for a successful program. None of the penalties imposed by the Court will be in the form of hazing. “But,” said Lewis, “we will use all appropriate means to impress on the freshman's mind his status in the framework of the student body.”

February is the expected completion date for the new $50,000 post office, which will replace the old Depot Street office. The College is planning to lease the new building to the Post Office Department for twenty years and has designed it so that it may conceivably be used for classes eventually.

AIR-CONDITIONED P. O.
To be located between the Carolina Inn and Depot Street on Schofield Corner, the post office will contain 4,000 square feet of floor space, will have an architectural design consistent with that found on the campus, and will be air-conditioned. The main entrance to the post office will be built on a level below the street level and will face Main Street. There is also a side entrance and parking facilities for 25 cars.

50 NEW CARRELS
Construction will also begin on the $265,000 library wing, which will increase the book capacity from 100,000 to 200,000 volumes. Seating space for study will be increased by 175, and 50 new carrels will be added. With the addition of the wing, several major changes will also be made in the main library building. A new air-conditioned smoking and newspaper reading room will be added under the present lobby. The receiving room and the offices of the library staff will be located in the new wing, and the present lobby will be completely done over.

RESERVE READING
The north end of the second floor will be made into a reserve book reading room, while the south end will be cleared out to make an open reading room. The committee which is responsible for the research done on the wing is headed by Mr. Martin and consists of Dr. Lilly, Dr. Davidson, Dr. Logan, and Dr. Workman.
