tor, and we’ve realized that we’ve got to come together,” Butcher explained. “We’re really focused right now, and we’ve been coming together as a team.”

Butcher’s 20 points and career-high 19 rebounds guided Davidson in a 62-49 home victory over Pfeiffer on Monday. The ‘Cats played their most solid all-around game of the season, avoiding prolonged offensive lapses which have cost them in other contests and holding Pfeiffer to 23.3% shooting from the floor in the second half. Burke, with six, and Crosswhite, with 14, combined for 20 points in keeping a formidable front. Roos kept Davidson steady on the floor, and Sharpe (13 points) and Crosswhite dove aggressively after balls throughout.

The previous Saturday, Davidson fell, 73-63, at Wofford; the defeat was the club’s third straight. Butcher scored 21 points, and Tonya Sharpe added 12, but Davidson could not overcome a seven-point halftime deficit.

At home for the first time in nearly a month on January 13, Davidson held off Western Carolina for 20 minutes, taking a 34-29 advantage at the half. The Catamounts, the first Southern Conference foe of the season, returned to overpower the ‘Cats as the game continued, earning a 76-52 victory; Ferrucci sustained her broken leg in the second half. Butcher connected for 14 points and her second consecutive nine-rebound game; Sharpe and Maggie Young each scored 13 for Davidson, which saw its shooting percentage from the floor drop from 57.7% in the first half to 30.4% in the second.

On January 9, Davidson finished a five-game road trip by dropping a 74-59 decision to Carnegie Mellon, despite a 19-point, 10-rebound performance from Butcher and 16 points from Young. The previous evening, the ‘Cats raised their record to 3-5 by defeating Philadelphia Pharmacy, 84-60. Young led Davidson with 17 points, followed by Sharpe’s 13, Butcher’s 12 (and 13 rebounds) and Ferrucci’s 11.

Davidson played a tight match at Franklin & Marshall on January 6 before succumbing, 56-51. Sharpe and Butcher paced the ‘Cats with 17 and 14 points, respectively.

A January 2-3 tournament at UNC Wilmington ushered in the New Year for the ‘Cats, who were topped, 91-53, by New Hampshire in the second game. Young was the lone Davidson member in double figures, scoring 15 points. Davidson fell, 78-70, to the host school in the first round; Sharpe led all scorers with 22 points, as the club tried to come back from a 16-point halftime deficit. “The key was that we scored points when the clock was stopped,” Filar said. Sharpe hit eight of nine from the free throw line, and Roos connected on seven of eight.

Sharpe also scored 22 against Lenoir-Rhyne at home on December 18 in an 84-71 defeat. Ferrucci added 21 and Butcher 15, along with 12 rebounds, to provide the ‘Cats with a balanced inside-outside attack. Six days earlier, Davidson hit only 25% of its first-half shots in losing, 71-40, at Liberty. Ferrucci’s 15 points were high for the club.

Davidson earned its second victory of the year December 9 at UNC-Asheville, notching a 62-48 win over the home squad. Ferrucci and Sharpe each burned the Bulldogs for 18 points, followed by Roos’ 11. Ferrucci pulled down 12 rebounds, and Butcher 11, to guide the ‘Cats inside.

Assistant coach Claire Gardin acknowledges that the team has progressed rapidly since the season commenced, but insists her goals remain the same. “We still expect nothing but effort and intensity; that’s all we’re asking for.”
