Y. M. C. A. ITEMS.
Rev. J. H. Henderlite, pastor of the First Presbyterian church, of Gastonia, N. C., conducted the regular Y. M. C.
A. service last Thursday night. Mr. Henderlite is a Hampden-Sidney man, and a classmate of Dr. Arbuckle, of our faculty.
He chose as his subject: “Willing Service,” and developed his subject thoroughly and interestingly, driving home many practical lessons for
young men.

The new Y. M. C. A. Cabinet has had several meetings already, outlining and laying plans for next year’s work.
The fact that the new Cabinet has started in with next year’s work so far ahead of time ought to
make the Y. M. C. A. work next year more efficient than ever before.

Plans are already on foot for making this a banner year for Davidson's representation at the Blue Ridge Conference, April
12-21.

Zeb Crawford ('13) is Secretary of the Y. M. C. A. at Jacksonville, Fla.
Larry Boggs is Gym Instructor at the Y. M. C. A. of Raleigh, N. C.
Bob King, of Union Theological Seminary, was here Sunday, accompanying Dr. W. W. Moore.

TOWN ITEMS OF THE WEEK.
Dr. W. W. Moore, President of the Union Theological Seminary, filled the pulpit here Sunday in both the morning and
evening services. He is staying at the home of Dr. Thos. L. Lingle.

FORMER "D" ATHLETES.

Everett Booe, who played such star ball last season, is with the Indianapolis Federals now. At their spring training camp,
at Kashita, Tex., he was showing up in fine form. In an exhibition game, which was won from the Philadelphia
Nationals, Cashion pitched for five innings and allowed only two hits. He is a favorite on the Washington team, and
has fine control this year.

"Horse" Fuller made the trip with the Virginia Squad to the Johns Hopkins track meet.

Bob Fetzer, a star in all branches of athletics while in school here, has charge of Fishbourne, and has prospects
for a good baseball team.

Davidson misses "Tiny" Graham on the field every afternoon. He is now in the insurance business in Los Angeles, Cal.
