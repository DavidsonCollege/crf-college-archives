Trying to stretch dollars when you're computer shopping doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice performance. The affordable Macintosh® Classic® has
everything you need—including a monitor, keyboard, mouse, 2 megabytes of RAM, and a 40-megabyte hard disk. Just plug everything in
and the Macintosh Classic is ready to run, because the system software is already installed. And, thanks to the Macintosh's
easy-to-use graphical interface, you’ll be up and running in no time.

Like every Macintosh, the Classic can run thousands of available applications that all work in the same, consistent way—so once
you've learned one program, you're well on your way to learning them all. And this is one cheap roommate that
doesn’t have trouble sharing.

The Apple® SuperDrive—standard equipment with every Macintosh—reads from and writes to Macintosh, MS-DOS, OS/2, and Apple II floppy disks, which
means you can share information with someone who uses a different type of computer.

See the Macintosh Classic for yourself. It'll change your mind about cheap roommates.
