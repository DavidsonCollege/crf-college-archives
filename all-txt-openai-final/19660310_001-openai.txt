**Snyderless ’Cats Romp As Knowles Buckets 39**

By ARCH McCALLUM  
Davidsonian Asst. Sports Editor

And then he was gone. Only seven minutes and 20 seconds had elapsed and the score was a tight 12-11 when the superhorse fouled tiny Henry Carey and trudged to the bench burdened with three personals. The ‘Cats had started off this first venture in NCAA Tournament play as tight as mainsprings. Rhode Island’s Yankee Conference Champions, a team of diminutive race horses, had matched them basket for basket. Then it happened. Davidson's incomparable leader, without whom the squad of rookies was supposed to degenerate to a spineless gang of alleycats, was on the bench. The Rams were ready to pounce. But a rude awakening awaited them. None other than Pinky Hatcher, the sure-handed, never-shoot sixth man, led a 13-4 charge that caught the Rhodies by surprise and knocked them out of the ball game for good. Hatcher, shooting with unheard-of abandon, popped in one long jumper, then, trying another, missed but stole the rebound and fired it in from the corner. Bobby Lane also became offensive for a change, and took over leadership of the team with the departure of Snyder. He threw in a long 30-footer and then drew raves from the crowd with driving, twisting lay-ups. But the star, the man who was beside himself with hustle and finesse was Rod Knowles. The tall sophomore threw in shots from every conceivable position. He started the game firing from the hinterlands, then moved inside to crush the pitifully-small Rams under the basket. Knowles scored 39 points on 15 of 27 from the floor and 9 of 11 from the line. In addition to collaring 20 rebounds, he dominated the lane in blocking seven shots. The big boy made a gallant try for a 40-point total. After going to the bench accompanied by a tremendous ovation from the partisan Blacksburg, Va. crowd, Knowles reentered the game in quest of the magic number. But Ronnie Stone stole the show with two amazing underhand shots and Coach Lefty Driesell retired Knowles from the game for the final time. Meanwhile, Dick Snyder who scored 11 points despite playing less than a fourth of the game, looked forward to the weekend, saying in all seriousness, “I’m sure glad that wasn’t my last game.”

**UN Reporter Sees No Viet Nam Solution**

There will always be a tomorrow in the Viet Nam war, declared Alexander Gabriel in chapel Tuesday. Then there will be two, then three and more Viet Nams. Chief United Nations correspondent Gabriel, described as the “reporter's reporter" and “unofficial dean and tutor of young UN correspondents,” said, in effect, that the U.S. is merely batting her head against the wall in Viet Nam. “We're not going to solve the Viet Nam problem,” he continued. “The pros and cons are too even." He added that the fighting could go on forever, until there are more wars to be fought, and this country cannot afford, under its present policy, to pull out of any of them. Evidently, Gabriel wanted to get the point across that the policy needs changing. “The United States is using words to fill a vacuum of ideas.” Since World War II, a great population explosion and new sovereign states have emerged. The alliances are breaking down, the Cold War is a myth, he asserted, and today small powers are big powers. “Nationalism is no longer the dominant theme of these little wars,” Gabriel emphasized. “The restlessness is caused by frustration over the tremendous gap between the ‘Haves’ and the ‘Have Nots.’” Thus, the wars of national liberation are based on economics, he concluded, but policy is not directed toward an economic solution. The foreign policy of the United States is atrocious, forcing nations to buy for the highest prices and sell for the lowest. Gabriel added that at present, the United Nations is not equipped to handle the problem of economics, since it cannot even get its own members to pay their dues. “The realization is that, somehow, the UN must renew itself if it is to accept the responsibility of maintaining peace in the world. The wars of national liberation can only be stopped at the roots—economically.”

**Superhorse, Mates**

By CLIFF DUKE  
Davidsonian Sports Writer

Davidson's young Wildcats raced over and through Rhode Island early in the week and turned toward Raleigh, brimming with confidence. At the end of the home stretch the finishing wire glistens, but Superhorse and his stablemates must first hurdle two stiff obstacles. Duke, St. Joseph’s, Syracuse and the Wildcats converge on Raleigh for games Friday and Saturday nights. The team which emerges victorious from this warfare will continue its quest for the national championship next weekend in College Park, Md. In the first round Davidson will square off with Syracuse's Orangemen, following the Duke-St. Joseph's tilt. The two winners scrap Saturday night, hoping to earn a shot at the national crown. Syracuse, the next ‘Cat opponent backed into the Eastern Regionals when the NCAA declared Pennsylvania ineligible for a preliminary contest. But the Syracuse team is rated as the best in the school's history. Paced by their All-American Dave Bing, the Orangemen ripped the cords for 89.9 points a game on the way to a 21-5 slate. The slender 6-3 Bing eclipsed the school scoring record, averaging 29.4 points a game. A superb leaper, he plays forward as well as guard. His teammates are 6-6 Rick Dean, Concert weekend will be very informal, centered around television coverage of Davidson basketball in the NCAA Eastern Regionals in Raleigh. Difficulty has arisen in planning of times for activities because of the uncertainty of the times of the games in Raleigh. The Social Council, however, has planned activities around the basketball games. Before and after the Friday night game, which starts at 9 p.m., unusual refreshments, probably pizza, will be served in the Union. A major drama production was originally planned for the weekend, but because of the conflict with the basketball tournament, the Drama Department has postponed its presentation of The Glass Menagerie from Friday and Saturday nights to Tuesday and Wednesday nights of next week. The piano concert by Peter Nero will be presented Saturday afternoon from 3 to 5:30 in Chambers Auditorium. Nero has performed throughout the world and is well known through concerts, records, television, and movies. His music appeals to both jazz and classical enthusiasts. Following the Nero concert food will be served at the Hungry-D Restaurant in the Union. Entertainment by an unusual folk artist, Purvis Lee, will be presented in the Union either

Business Honorary Formed

Omicron Delta Epsilon, national honor society in economics, has granted a charter to Davidson and the North Carolina Beta chapter will be formally installed in the near future. According to Dr. Louise Nelson, acting faculty advisor of the society, the organization’s purpose is to confer distinction for high scholastic achievement in economics on college juniors and seniors. The society promotes and stimulates interest in economic problems and encourages fellowship among students and faculty who share a common interest in economic analysis and policy. The qualifications for admission are completion of at least 12 hours of economics with a 2.25 grade average and a general academic average of 2.0. The following students will be initiated as charter members: Bunky Blalock, Eddie Craig, Ray Fisher, Tiff Harrington, Johnny Hash, Rick Hodgin, and Bill McGuire. Also, Jim McNab, Jim Rostan, Tom Simmons, Bill Skinner, Arnie Snider, Irv Welling, and Pinckney Whitson.

Picked As Underdogs

Vaughn Harper, 6-3 Sam Penceal, and 6-4 Jim Boeheim. Although they give away height to Davidson's frontline, they are all very quick and exceptional jumpers. George Hicker, an outstanding shooter, is the second leading scorer at 15.7, although he doesn't start. The New Yorkers are very slight favorites, but the unusually optimistic Lefty Driesell refutes this. “There's no reason why we can’t win it all. Syracuse has a fine team, but we're going to Raleigh believing we can win both games.” If the ‘Cats conquer Syracuse, they will meet the Duke-St. Joseph’s winner. A final contest with the Hawks would unveil a revenge motive. “They beat us by four points before, but I think we could win this time,” Driesell states. By upending Providence 63-48 with a stifling zone defense, the Hawks earned a berth at Raleigh. They not only received fine performances from All-American Matt Guokas and rebounder Cliff Anderson, but also received a tremendous spark from Tom Duff's 19 points and 11 rebounds. The Hawks play tough defense, utilizing the zone press and man-for-man effectively. Earlier, in Charlotte, they nipped the ’Cats 83-79. A Duke-Davidson final would generate tremendous enthusiasm, because of the natural rivalry between the two schools. Sparks would fly, especially in the frontline where 6-7 Mike Lewis, 6-7 Bob Riedy, and 6-6 Jack Marin would duel with Dick Snyder, Rod Knowles, and Tom Youngdale. This is another strong, good-shooting Blue Devil squad. The play of Warren Chapman, Ron Wendelin, and others give them a strong bench. The only comparison Vic Bubas, Duke mentor, will make between these second-ranked Devils and his previous crews is to contend that these are the best rebounders he has had.

Film Friends Slate ‘Dog Star Man’

Film Friends will show its second presentation of the semester on Tuesday at 8 p.m. in the Morrison Room of the Union. The film, Dog Star Man, employs some new cinemagraphic techniques. Its director Stan Brakhage has put together a masterpiece that has neither plot nor characterization in the usual sense. His work has been compared to James Joyce's stream of consciousness style. A short, World In Remembrance, which is a color presentation of the funeral procession of Sir Winston Churchill, will be shown.

ROTC Honorary Taps 25 Students

Twenty-five advanced ROTC students were tapped into Scabbard and Blade at Tuesday's drill. These included students selected on the basis of their performance during the first semester as well as those participating in the second semester program. The new initiates include Jim Stokes, Jim McNab, Stu Cox, Bob Bryan, Rufus Adair, Ernie Larkin, Danny Boone, Hoyle Rymer, Butch Allison, Richard Little, Joe Obenshain, Jim Houser, and Joe Jelks. Also, Charles Steele, David Purnell, John Crenshaw, Jim Hollandsworth, Britt Snider, Bill Dave Townsend, Steve Smith, and Dick
