Is YMCA Needed?

Do we need a YMCA on this campus? Before we start discussing the role of the chaplain or where the
YMCA should be located, the basic issue of the YMCA’s existence must be examined. Since the YMCA is organized, financed,
and administered by students, we first must be certain there is enough student interest on campus to maintain the organization.
Not only must there be interested people in the cabinet, but there must be enough students in the entire student
body interested in participating in YMCA programs.

Estimated figures of the number of people presently participating in the YMCA are disappointing, and the financial figures of student
support are even more discouraging, if not disgraceful. When we look at the expensive stereos in the dorms and the
plush cars in the parking lot, it is a sobering thought that these same people refuse to donate $5 to
finance the tutoring of underprivileged children, nor are they willing to give their time in helping local scout troops.

Therefore, we come to the difficult point where we must evaluate student interest alongside the objectives of the YMCA. Should
this organization continue to direct programs toward the surrounding community if students are not willing to participate? If the YMCA
is directed more toward student services, would there still be enough student interest to continue its functioning? To answer these
questions will ultimately be to decide the future of the YMCA. We therefore call upon the YMCA cabinet to conduct
an in-depth study of its organization to determine what, if anything, can be done to rejuvenate interest in the YMCA.
We still believe there is a place for the YMCA on campus as well as in community activities.

Comprehensive Fee

We have nothing but praise for the administration’s handling of the comprehensive fee this week. The president and vice presidents
clearly showed that they do care and are ready to respond to student questions. That the administration placed student rights
above financial considerations is also encouraging for the future. In the next few weeks, the business office will begin to
put together next year’s budget. We only hope they will continue to place student needs above financial considerations on their
list of priorities.

Exchange Program

The Eight College Exchange Program offers Davidson students just the chance that many students claim they so vehemently want, to
escape the agonies of life here. Yet the fact remains that as of now only two students have applied for
this program for next year. Extensive efforts have been made by Ostwalt and others to make the Exchange program as
innovative and easy to qualify as possible. Almost all applicants for the program are accepted with no minimum grade-point average
required. Grades are readily transferable from participating colleges. Pass-fail options are accepted. Suitable arrangements can be worked out for those
enrolled in ROTC or the Humanities program to participate. Beyond all this, the exchange has been enthusiastically endorsed by returning
students as a worthwhile and exciting program. Yet, few Davidson students have shown any interest.

We cannot understand this incongruency in the attitudes of students here. Many men here solemnly vowed that they are dying
to go to school with girls. But when the opportunity is presented, there seem to be few takers. There is
now a chance that some of the women’s schools will drop the program unless more men enroll at their colleges
for the number of girls who can come to Davidson. The opportunity is available. All it takes is for students
to take advantage of it.

“The Ballad of Sam The Cat”

Sitting in a large comfortable chair, Sam greeted me in typical cat fashion — a meow, a quick glance —
and then scampered out the window onto the roof. I find it extremely hard to convince myself that Sam is
unique among cats at Davidson. Sam, a cat for only a short time, finds life at Davidson providing adequately for
the primary activities of a cat, eating and sleeping. Beyond that, Sam displays a great indifference to the goings-on in
the house. No activity or idea has been spared in attempting to coerce Sam into activity. Complacently, Sam gazes up
at our attempts with half-opened eyes, yawns, and returns to the slumber which we have disturbed.

Even in this relatively passive state, Sam rules our apartment. The basic device Sam uses to ensure our cooperation is
getting underfoot as we attempt to navigate from one room to the next. If this does not work, Sam proceeds
to attack our feet from hiding places so as to keep us off-balance and remind us in whose realm we
are. Sam is not an idle cat. With much inventiveness and a firm belief in what the life of a
cat in Davidson should be, Sam goes to great lengths to provide diversions from the dull life in our apartment.

One of Sam’s favorite activities is journeys on the outside. Most of the time these travels are of short duration
and do not cover much ground. The most typical of these journeys is an almost daily journey to Chambers. I
was not aware Sam made such journeys until a friend informed me that he had discovered Sam exploring this land
of Chambers. He also said that he did not understand what a cat would be doing in such an exotic
land. I must confess that I have no idea why Sammakes this journey to Chambers or even what is the
purpose of the journey. However, all outward signs say that Sam has a good time on the journey, which is
all one can expect from a young cat. Lately, Sam has taken to playing with animals. Two of Sam’s favorites
are two flying squirrels, who live in the general vicinity. The reason Sam likes playing with them is that even
though Sam is bigger than they are, these two squirrels have the capacity for playing right back. Squirrels, as you
know, are agile and very quick, and with this prowess, they keep Sam off-balance. Sam enjoys this challenge but at
times becomes over-zealous in playing. Squirrels sometimes lose patience with this playing and resort to the tactics of biting. It
has become necessary to keep these creatures from becoming too excited with Sam's impulsiveness.

Perhaps the most tragic of Sam’s endeavors concerns a helpless bird which Sam lured into the apartment. Having all the
good intentions of a playful cat, Sam had a great time with the unsuspecting bird. Sam chased this poor bird
all over the apartment, scaring her half to death. Sam toyed with her and half-killed this poor creature. Then Sam
left her alone, perhaps to give her a chance to recover before beginning the fun and games all over again.
I somehow feel part of the guilt for the playful mauling of this bird. Perhaps if I could have conveyed
to Sam the capacity to see the good in the existence of creatures other than cats in Davidson, this might
not have occurred. But I somehow think that Sam will never understand and will play with another bird and perhaps
kill her.

In new developments in activities, Sam has done nothing. It is as if Sam built us up only to let
us down easy again after two weeks away from Davidson. I really do not understand Sam. I had hopes of
an exciting new life at Davidson with Sam. I had hoped Sam would be a compassionate, understanding cat. Sam is
when Sam feels like it (which is not very often). The best I can say for Sam is that Sam
is a typical cat with all the indifference and independence cats show toward people. In fact, I am sure Sam
will be unmoved by this perhaps last attempt to coerce some activity, which is as it should be, for Sam
is the perfect example for cats in Davidson.

Lately, Sam has become very inactive (for a cat). After all the excitement before Christmas and the promise of exciting
new developments in activities, Sam has done nothing. It is as if Sam built us up only to let us
down easy again after two weeks away from Davidson. I really do not understand Sam. I had hopes of an
