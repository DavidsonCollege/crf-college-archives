**Here we go, Wildcats, here we go!**

Fielding Division I athletic teams at a school of only 1600 students is difficult, and fielding teams that are competitive
and successful is even tougher. Now imagine trying to find support for those teams from a student body notoriously entrenched
in the library. The job of inciting the often stoic Davidson population into a frenzy can be a difficult one,
but it is a challenge undertaken selflessly throughout the football and basketball seasons by our cheerleaders.

For much of the squad, Davidson is their first cheering experience—while many of them have athletic backgrounds, few were cheerleaders
in high school. Cheering at Davidson has instead been an opportunity for former dancers and gymnasts to continue doing what
they love while meeting new people and being involved in the college. Not all of our cheerleaders are first-timers though,
and that mix of experience and fresh enthusiasm makes for a dynamic team. It could not be what it is,
though, without the leadership of junior captains Elizabeth Spitz and Laurie Gomer.

Spitz began cheering at Davidson as a freshman after some of the seniors on the team approached her and asked
her to try out. Spitz, a lifelong gymnast, had taken up cheerleading in high school after the time commitment of
gymnastics became too much to handle, but she hadn’t even considered continuing to cheer in college. The adjustment wasn’t difficult
for her, because her team never competed in high school, offering instead a relaxed and fun atmosphere similar to what
she has found here at Davidson.

Gomer, on the other hand, came to Davidson with 11 years of cheering experience and from a competitive high school
program that regularly participated in national competitions. Having spent so long in a high-stress environment, Gomer decided she needed a
break. The draw to Davidson was initially the academics, but being able to continue cheering in a relaxed, comfortable environment
sealed the deal. The adjustment was a little different for Gomer, because, as she explained, “It was strange to be
on a squad with people who didn’t know what ‘bottle rocket to free standing liberty retake to heel stretch full
down’ meant.”

Both girls bring very different backgrounds to the table, but it is their variety of leadership that makes the squad
at Davidson unique. They are able to practice and perform in a comfortable environment while still maintaining a competitive edge.
Every member of the team agrees that the best parts of being a cheerleader at Davidson are the relaxed environment
and all of the friends they have made, but success doesn’t come without hard work.

One is left, then, with the perpetually debated question of whether or not cheerleading is a sport. Since I have
always wondered myself, I took this article as an opportunity to put my mind, and perhaps those of my fellow
students, at ease by getting the answer straight from the source. As Spitz pointed out to me, the cheerleading team
practices three times a week, lifts weights twice weekly, and cheers at games which—especially during basketball season, when there can
be as many as three in a week—is a daunting time commitment.

I suppose the answer lies in your definition of sport. As Gomer explained to me, in her definition, “A sport
constitutes athleticism as well as competition.” According to that definition, she agrees that the Davidson squad is not a sport,
as they are not a competitive squad, but she contends that what they do does require a great deal of
athleticism. I suppose that, as a proponent of pure sport for the sake of sport, I have to agree that
anything you do that requires athleticism can be considered a sport.

By RICHARD CONNOLLY Staff Writer

Hall of Famer Bill Veeck once said, “The true harbinger of spring is not crocuses or swallows returning to Capistrano,
but the sound of a bat on the ball.” Indeed, the sound of batting practice has been echoing around campus
recently, signaling that spring is here and the start of a new baseball season is just around the corner. Having
narrowly missed back-to-back 20-win seasons in 2001, a feat the team hasn’t accomplished since their 1993 and 1994 campaigns, head
coach Dick Cooke and his squad hope that a trio of all-conference seniors and several key newcomers will help Davidson
become a serious contender in the Southern Conference this year.

“We have a really good nucleus of upperclassmen at the plate and on the mound,” Cooke said. “The veteran leadership
on this team is as good as any I’ve been around. That will help develop our rookies, which will be
a key to our season, as we possibly could have up to four freshmen in the starting lineup.”

James Marino and Billy Ryan will captain the 2002 edition of Davidson baseball as the Wildcats aim for postseason play
after a disappointing 10th place finish kept the team from the SoCon tournament last year.

Offensively, the team will be led by preseason All-American senior Tim Frend, who will bat in the three spot behind
leadoff hitter Jack Purcell and promising freshman Eli Benefield. “We’ve got our five best hitters back as seniors this year,
and I think we’ve got more depth than we expected,” comments Ryan. Marino will assume duties as cleanup hitter, providing
the protection that could result in a huge year for Frend, who is already established as one of the premier
hitters in Davidson history.

With the loss of Academic All-American Wes Self and talented hurlers Jeremiah Parvin and Ryan Stroker, the Wildcats need to
fill a void in the pitching department. The starting rotation will consist primarily of veteran ballplayers, but the top five
candidates only have a combined 23 starts between them, 15 of those by senior Mark Wells, who will likely be
the number one starter. “The good thing is that we’ve got a lot of options on the mound this year,”
notes Ryan. “I think we’ve got a good number of guys who will help us out, and give us some
flexibility on conference weekends.”

On the defensive side of the ball, the Davidson nine look solid, and should provide excellent defense for the relatively
inexperienced crop of pitchers. Purcell will man the hot corner, as he takes over for the departed all-conference third sacker,
Cassidy Lundin. With the move of Purcell from second to third, Benefield will be the likely replacement at the keystone
sack. Joining Benefield to complete the double-play combination will be junior D.J. Dailey, a sure-handed shortstop who has started since
his freshman year. At first, Cooke has yet to decide on a starter, but has a nice array in juniors
Mark Williams and Matt Young and freshmen Michael Muniz and Justin Hartanov. Roaming the outfield for...
