Confidential Health

Stress can be beaten

“Dear Confidential Health: I am a junior and until this term I always felt that I handled the stress of
coursework and extracurricular activities well. This year I feel so pressured. Several of my friends are in the same activities
and courses that I’m in and they don’t seem to have any problem coping. Can you suggest some ways that
I can deal with stress?”

Dear Junior: Stress is very individualized. What is stressful to you won’t be stressful to someone else, and we all
have different ways of dealing with stress. The following are some suggestions that you might find helpful.

Manage yourself. Don’t let the demands of coursework, social events, friends, work, and so on, manage you. You can gain
control by setting priorities and by realizing there are limits to what you can accomplish every day. Use a date
book to get a realistic idea of when upcoming projects are due. Budget your time so that you can complete
your work without having to push at the last minute. By procrastinating you’ll only end up increasing your anxiety when
deadlines come up.

Be realistic. If events really seem to be unmanageable, consider dropping out of a few activities, or re-evaluating your expectations.
Maybe you can’t make all A’s and be actively involved in other events this term.

Take care of your body. Exercise will relieve your tensions, help you relax, and give you energy to do the
things you want to do. Eat a balanced diet and get plenty of sleep. Give your body time to rest
and rejuvenate. Don’t try to reduce your stress by taking alcohol or drugs. You’ll be creating many more anxieties than
you’ll ever relieve.

Take time out for yourself. Reserve time to reward yourself for your hard work. Listen to your favorite album, take
a bubble bath, or go to a movie you’ve wanted to see. Be indulgent.

Don’t suffer in silence. If you can’t reduce your stress, contact an objective person who can help you. On campus,
contact the Student Counseling Center in the basement of the Union. Don’t stand by and wait for things to get
better.

MacLads
By ASH ASHANUDDIN, GLENN FOGLE, and JOHN HARRIS

Since the end of the term is rapidly approaching and everybody has those nasty term papers due, the MacLads thought
you freshmen and other clueless Davidson students could use a few suggestions to explain to your professors why your term
papers are late. (That is, of course, if they are). These can be used at any time in the term
of course, but now is the time when they will really come in handy. When your professor asks you why
you don’t have your paper, respond:

Men:
“What paper?”
“I didn’t have enoughtime, I was stair-diving for my physics project. “I was trapped at Queens.” “We were busy writing
an apology to the bovines.” “I passed out at the Squid house.”

Women: “I was literally paralyzed with laughter when I read the ‘Spoof of the Week’ column.” “What paper? I was
writing a letter to The Davidsonian complaining about the MacLads.” “I was grazing with those Ruskies.” “I don’t know.” (Then,
if you want, start crying).

Time ripe for term paper excuses:
“I just couldn’t do it because I was slaving over the crossword puzzle in last week’s Davidsonian.”
“The SPEs wouldn’t let me out of their house.”
“I was dreaming about Bob the Carrot.”

Question of the week: Why did eight policemen have six unidentified youths spread-eagled on Warner Hall's back porch in the
wee hours of last Sunday morning?
A. They were selling tickets to the policeman’s ball.
B. They had nothing better to do.
C. They were looking for the MacLads.
D. They were pretending they were Clint Eastwood.
E. None of the above.

Next week: the MacLads give tips on Halloween safety.

Hey Bob! Are you going to the party on the Persian Moon?
No way, Dope! I'm going to the tie-dying party with Becky.
Gee, Bob, how come you and Trendy are so busy, Tom?
I say art tie-dying parties are for following my fashion quips religiously, a fashion guide.

Gee, do you think you could share it with us?

The Beach Houses were fine. Davidson's Board of Trustees considered the sites to be taken. Told you we should have
put our money in South Africa. Look on the bright side, as a suave manager drives into town.

Who is that man? Could it be... yes! Group's gamer. We can get a takeover. My God, it's D. Turner!
Yes! It's takeover time!
