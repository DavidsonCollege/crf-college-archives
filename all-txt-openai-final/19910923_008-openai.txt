Honor

continued from page 6
of incompetence and lack of faith in the student body are mostly made by present council members afraid of losing their positions.

Others say, if it’s not broken then don’t fix it. Still, Davidson should not be afraid to re-evaluate its honor system and make changes which would give more students a greater sense of connection with their own honor. The large number of students present at an open trial last month makes me feel that there are a lot of people in the community who want to participate in the system but are shut out by our elective process. The long list of candidates in the Dean of Students’ office for the upcoming election also points to this desire. Let us not be so irresponsible that we let a few people make all of the decisions in honor trials. A self-selected jury pool would put the honor system in the hands of more students, eliminate some of the negativeness associated with the current system, and bring more students closer to their own sense of honor. We are all part of the honor system at Davidson and each of us should have a say in its operation.

I propose that the SGA hold a forum on student and faculty opinion of the honor system and create a questionnaire for students to make suggestions for a better judicial system.

Opinions qualification exam

1) Do you have an opinion?

2) Do you have at least a nominal grasp of the English language?

If you answered positively to both of the above then you qualify as a potential Opinions columnist. In fact, even if you failed the above quiz miserably, we'd probably still take you. Write for Opinions.
