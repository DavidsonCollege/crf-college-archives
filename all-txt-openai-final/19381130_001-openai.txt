R.O.T.C. Features Mock Trial

VOL. XXVI DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N. C., WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 30, 1938 No. 11

Ballard Is For Accused Man In Military Court

Armstrong to Be Tried for Assaulting Lieutenant Johnny Tice

FRED STAIR TO PRESIDE

Ballard Replaces Turner As Defense Counsel

Ballard will replace Andy Turner as defense counsel for Jim Armstrong in the R.O.T.C. mock military court martial to be
held in Chambers building Friday night at 8 o’clock. Lieutenant Armstrong faces the accusation of refusing to obey the command
of a superior officer, of drawing a weapon and assaulting an officer. Last Wednesday afternoon Lieutenant Johnnie Tice, second in
command of Company C, ordered Lieutenant Armstrong who was drilling a platoon to take his platoon in, but Lieutenant Armstrong
deliberately refused and argued with Lieutenant Tice. In the argument Lieutenant Armstrong drew his sabre and struck Lieutenant Tice.

The Battalion Commander, Fred Stair, will preside over the Court and maintain the strict order and discipline customary in military
courts-martial. Captain Wesley Coghill has already secured the desired witnesses and has compiled his evidence and proof in his capacity
of Trial Judge Advocate. The Law Member of the Court, John Doty, has looked into the legal and technical matters
concerning the trial of the accused and stands ready to answer the questions of the court in such matters. Sam
Hemphill will be the acting Recorder of the Court. Practice for the trial court martial will be held sometime Thursday.
The students of Davidson College and the townspeople are all cordially invited to see and hear this mock military court
martial.

Carnegie Set Almost Ready

Students May Hear Records In Banquet Hall This Week

The Carnegie Record Library has not been fully set up in the banquet hall as yet, but records are available
for students to play according to an announcement made today by Dr. Lingle. The Record Library was received several weeks
ago, but setting up has been delayed due to cross-indexing for finger-tip references, the addition of doors to the walnut
cabinet for better protection of the records, the delay in the arrival of the file and the remaining records. Dr.
Lingle’s announcement stated that the banquet hall would be open at certain times in the afternoon and evening and that

Men Return After Frat Convention

Pittman and Mullen Back From New York After Successful Meeting

Raymond Pittman and Tom Mullen returned early Monday morning from the National Interfraternity Conference held in the Hotel Commodore in
New York City from the 25th through the 26th of November. Delegates from between ninety and one-hundred colleges from the
East to the West coast attended the conference which opened Friday morning with the registration of the delegates and then
a formal meeting afterwards during which reports from the various committees were delivered.

James E. Craig, writer for the New York Sun, delivered one of the main addresses on “Fraternity Intangibles.” The topic
of “How social minded is the social fraternity” was discussed by three distinguished speakers, Dr. John A. Schaeffer, President of
Franklin and Marshall College; Dr. Wilbur A. Cramblet, President of Bethany College; and Dr. Harry S. Rogers, President of Polytechnic
Institute of Brooklyn and Secretary of the National Interfraternity Conference. The Saturday morning meeting discussed many of the problems that
present themselves to college fraternities. A statement from Tom Mullen said: “We enjoyed the meetings very much, and we feel
sure that we will profit by the information that we received while there. It should make for a better understanding
among the various fraternities.”

Jackson Will Attend Meet

Treasurer Leaves Today For Conference

F. L. Jackson, treasurer of Davidson College, leaves today for a meeting of the Financial Advisory Service of the American
Council on Education to be held in Chicago, December 2nd and 3rd. This Service studies, in a research way, problems
arising in connection with the business administration of colleges. It also renders advisory service in the field of accounting, reporting,
budgeting, and other problems relating to the financial phase of educational institutions. It was organized when the National Committee on
Standard Reports for Institutions of Higher Education was dissolved. The findings of the latter committee were published in a book,
“College and University Finance”, a copy of which is in the library.

It is composed of administrative officials of six or seven colleges and universities of different sizes and types in various
areas of the country. The service has a paid staff in Washington which is available for visits to institutions to
assist in reorganizations of business offices and to advise with college administrators, faculty, and trustees. From Chicago Jackson goes to
Pittsburgh to attend the annual meeting of the Business Officers Association of Colleges and Universities of the Eastern States to
be held December 5 and 6. At this conference, matters of common interest to college business administrators will be discussed.

First Issue Of Journal Distributed

Davidson’s first Alumni Journal of the year, being put into the mails today by alumni secretary Fred Smith, covers a
wide range of subjects. Crammed into the relatively small pages of the Journal are articles ranging from the history of
Davidson during the years 1888 to 1938; a record of the P-38’s Davidson during the summer and again of those
in Europe as seen by Frank MacBryde, ’35, on his motorcycle tour; chapters from Japan to South Carolina and of
bankers in Davidson and New York; all of this not to mention class personals beginning in 1888 and continuing to
the present.

Carolinas’ Leading Sports Writers Invited

Coach Wallace Wade of Duke University will be the principal speaker here Thursday night for the ‘D’ Club banquet to
be held in the Banquet Hall of Chambers Building. This banquet will probably be the largest of its kind ever
given here. Interest will be high as to what the famous Duke coach will have to say after his victory
over Pitt. He will probably also express his ideas as to Duke’s prospects of winning the Rose Bowl Classic on
New Year’s Day. Conrad Frederick Smith, alumni secretary, will serve as toastmaster.

One of the leading news papers of the Carolinas have been invited to attend. With the varsity football team, the
“B” team and all members of the “D” Club, the guests are expected. Several entertaining skits are being planned. Decorations
will be in red and black.
