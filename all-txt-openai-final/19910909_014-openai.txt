### Campus Forum on Eating Disorders

#### By Meg Jones

On Thursday, September 12, at 4:00 pm in the 900 Room, the Campus Forum Committee is sponsoring an open discussion
on eating disorders. A health professional and four Davidson students who have eating disorders will talk about their experiences and
offer ways in which friends may be able to help.

Eating disorders are a prevalent concern on college campuses across the country and are often not recognized or discussed. Everyone
has heard of Bulimia and Anorexia, and though the discussion will focus on these most common diseases, there are many
other forms of eating disorders.

The following story is written by a person who didn’t feel comfortable enough to speak but wants to express their
feelings about this issue:

“This summer I was reading an article on how to have an accurate blood cholesterol measurement taken. The article said
that cholesterol levels could vary greatly according to how much had been eaten. The writer suggested that because of this,
people should not have their cholesterol levels taken just after Thanksgiving, or any time when there has been more eating
going on than usual, because they would be unrealistically high. Levels should also not be measured just after a time
of fasting when they are misleadingly low. In fact, the writer concluded, you should maintain your normal eating pattern for
three weeks in order to get an accurate reading.

I suppose, therefore, that it is absolutely impossible for my cholesterol levels to be measured with any degree of accuracy
whatsoever. There is no way that I could eat consistently for three weeks at a time. My three weeks would
be made up of various combinations of starving days and binging days.

Sometimes I think that my eating is basically normal. I don’t make myself throw up, I don’t take laxatives, I
don’t starve myself for days on end, I don’t exercise compulsively, I don’t take diet pills. In other words, I
don’t fit under any label that society has assigned to categorize various eating disorders. But I think eating disorders are
much more pervasive than the small number of people suffering from these serious problems would imply. You don’t have to
be bulimic or anorexic to have an eating disorder. I think if you manipulate your eating at all, you have
an eating disorder.

When a person feels hungry, they should be able to recognize that they are hungry, be able to identify what
they feel like eating, eat it, and then not think about food again until they are hungry. This is what
I think of as normal eating. I can’t do any of these things. I can no longer identify when I
am hungry very well, because for so long I have stressed to myself that it doesn’t matter when I am
hungry. All that matters is when I am allowing myself to eat. Since I try never to allow myself to
eat, I feel an almost constant “false” hunger because I know I am going to be deprived in the future.
Of course, when at last I break the starvation, I totally binge in anticipation of the next long fast. It
is also hard for me to identify what I feel like eating.

If your body is craving a certain food, you should eat it whether it’s fattening or not. The craving itself
is your body trying to tell you that there is something in that food that it needs. I try to
eliminate certain foods entirely not because I don’t see them as things that nourish me but as things that I
have to restrict due to their caloric content. Because these foods are off-limits, I have created a “false” craving for
them. If I ever break down and eat food from this forbidden list, I eat A LOT of it because
tomorrow it will be forbidden again.

It is also impossible for me to stop thinking about food once my hunger is satisfied. I think about food
constantly. I think about organizing, manipulating, and controlling food all the time. This obsessive and constant thinking about food is,
I think, the real disorder. Nobody tries to manipulate, control, or organize when they need to go to the restroom.
That would be ridiculous. You go when you need to go and then you forget about it until you need
to go again. But it is just as ridiculous and unbelievable that so many people disrupt the natural function of
eating. Why do we do it?”

The Campus Forum Committee would like to encourage people to attend this discussion because we feel it will be very
beneficial to a great many people on this campus. Thursday, September 12, 4:00 pm, 900 Room.

### Research, Stress, and Celebrities: An Intern's Inside Scoop on CNN

#### By Meredith Boone

CNN -- the network that brought you the war. It was pretty heady stuff for a summer job. I'll admit
that I was a little nervous. Broad- so. cast News aside,Who knew what I was really getting myself into? Some
initial observations: the employees at CNN are smart, savvy, and above all stressed. Because of the major emphasis on teamwork,
I didn’t witness much cutthroat competition. At the same time, however, no one at CNN is allowed to forget that
he or she is very easily replaceable. In other words, if you don’t play as part of the team, and
you don’t do it extremely well, you’re out. Instead, the stress seemed to originate from the highly driven, almost perfectionist
employees. These people have a great respect for deadlines, so in most cases, everything is on time and ready for
air. However, when unforeseen circumstances occur: technical difficulties, late-breaking updates, or a scoop of world-wide importance, all Hell breaks loose.
I quickly discovered that, when times get tough, it’s important to do what you are told and stay out of
the way. Amazingly, even when the pace was at its most frenetic, the program on the air remained as polished
as ever.

This summer I was one of over one hundred interns who worked, without pay, in the various bureaus. My job
in CNN’s Booking and Research Department entailed helping to research the various guests who came on the air and writing
interview questions. If the guest came into the Atlanta bureau for their live interview, it was usually my responsibility to
make sure that the guest was made up, happy, and on the set at the allotted time. As a result,
I researched multiple interesting topics and was privileged to meet fascinating people. The variety in my job kept it appealing.
While one day I might be researching a proposed bill in Congress, the next day I could be digging for
dirt while reading the unauthorized biography of trashmonger Kitty Kelley.

Among those entrusted to my care were several interesting and/or famous people. Baseball great Mickey Mantle seemed very shy, but
generously signed a baseball for my little brother. Feminist Betty Friedan, my first guest, proved phenomenally rude. Other interesting people
were Lynn Martin, the U.S. Secretary of Labor; Debbie Reynolds, movie star and mother to Carrie Fisher; entrepreneur and philanthropist
Patrick Taylor; and finally, my personal hero, the King of the Blues, B.B. King! The man was, without question, one
of the nicest people I have ever met. (Be sure to check out the picture of B.B. and me bonding
in the makeup room!)

So, in sum, the summer was a blast. Is it for everyone? I don’t know, but if you get the
opportunity to work there, you’d be foolish to turn it down. As an English major, I enjoyed the research and
the writing. As an average person, I loved the opportunity to salivate over celebrities. And finally, I enjoyed the rush
from the constant activity, along with the instant gratification that comes when you hear a news anchor using your questions
on international television. Besides, where else could I have worked and at the same time, met my personal hero, watched
television all day, and kept up on the latest gossip about Ted and Jane?

A recent survey ranked North Carolina 43rd in literacy. This problem also exists in our own community here at Davidson.
Reading is an integral part of our society, and we can help illiterate adults through the Project X program. The
name originates from the fact that many people only sign their name with an X. Project X tutors them for
an hour each week.
