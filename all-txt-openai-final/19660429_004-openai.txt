**WORTHY SPEAKS**

**Santo Domingo, Selma Cited In Chapel Speech**

By JOE SAUNDERS
Davidsonian Staff Writer

“Saigon, Selma and Santo Domingo are parallels in futility and closely related.” This is the opinion of William Worthy, newspaper
correspondent, who spoke in chapel Monday. His speech attempted to show that the Negro civil rights movement is a part
of what he calls the Afro-Asian Latin American Revolution.

Worthy stated that in the past six years, Negro youths have alienated themselves from America. As examples of this, he
pointed to such anti-war leaflets as “Why Negroes Should Not Fight in America’s Wars,” and the wearing of badges with
such slogans as “The Viet Cong never called me a ‘nigger’.” Worthy said he felt that the civil rights movement
will link itself more and more closely to other revolutionary groups throughout the world. As this happens, advocates of non-violent
resistance, such as Martin Luther King and James Farmer, will lose control of the movement, and the black nationalists will
take over its leadership. He thinks this will be followed by Watts-type violence between Negroes, and the Ku Klux Klan
and other segregationist groups.

In relating civil rights to the anti-colonialist movement around the world, Worthy compared President Lyndon Johnson to Sheriff Jim Clark
of Selma. Both, he said, saw the world closing in on themselves and struck out blindly to prevent outside forces
from changing their surroundings. All America is doing now, he said, is maintaining an anti-colonial war. The government has even
gone so far as to finance a division of South Korean troops in order to conceal the true purpose of
our presence. Worthy compared the American bombing of North Viet Nam to the Ku Klux Klan bombings in the South.
Calling the United States “the tormentor of North and South Viet Nam,” he said the bombings were an attempt to
spread enough terror to halt the anti-colonial revolution. Quoting Walter Lippman, he said, “The American people are morally and intellectually
unprepared for the reality of things.” Worthy maintained that it is useless for America to play the role of a
modern King Canute trying to turn back the tide of revolution, for no new government will feel safe until all
colonialism and imperialism are dead.

**BLOOD DRIVE SETS RECORD**

A record number of blood donations—337 pints—was made during the Red Cross Blood Drive Monday and Thursday. According to Col.
Frederick B. Outlaw, this number constitutes the best participation of any district in Mecklenburg County in the last five years.
Maj. and Mrs. Ralph Gill were in charge of the drive. “I really appreciated the help all the students gave
us,” Maj. Gill said. “I thought they did a real fine job.” (Staff Photo by Olson).

**Drama Department Readies Ibsen’s Play**

Henrik Ibsen's An Enemy of the People, the third and final production of the Drama Department, will be presented Thursday
through Saturday in Hodson Hall. Curtain time for the first two nights will be at 8:15 p.m. On Saturday night,
the play will begin at 7:30 p.m., so that it will conclude before the Bitter-End Singers’ concert. Ibsen wrote An
Enemy of the People in retaliation against the supposedly liberal press in Norway in 1882. The press had first supported
Ibsen and his controversial ideas but had turned on him after he had written A Doll’s House and Ghosts. In
An Enemy of the People, Ibsen presents a young man who stands up for what he believes concerning a sanitation
problem in a Norwegian city against the opposing views of the people and press. Dr. Rupert Barber, assistant professor of
drama, commented, “Ibsen was the ‘angry young man’ of the turn of the century and was just as provocative to
the theatre of his day as Harold Pinter, John Osborn and Peter Weiss are now.” Peter Van Egmond, instructor in
English, will play the major role of Dr. Stockmann. Mrs. Louise Thompson and Miss Patsy Whitley will play his wife
and daughter respectively. The rest of the cast, including Bill Andrews, Don Davis, John Feuchtenberger, David Jones, Rawley Turner and
Joe Dial, are Davidson students.

**Pritchett To Give Vespers Sermon**

Rev. Carl R. Pritchett, pastor of the Bethesda Presbyterian Church, Bethesda, Md., will speak Sunday at Vespers. A graduate of
Davidson, Pritchett also served as pastor at the college church here for 12 years during the 1940s and early 1950s.
His other pastorates have included Smithfield, Anderson, S.C., and now Bethesda, where he has served for the past eight years.
Pritchett, also a graduate of Union Theological Seminary in Richmond, has been called one of the most courageous ministers in
his church. An active and outspoken proponent of civil rights, he was recently cited by the Washington Post for his
outstanding work in helping Negroes in the town of Scotland, a rural community in Maryland.

**WILLIAM WORTHY COMMENTS**

“There Is Little Enthusiastic Support For the Viet Nam War.”

**Worthy Points To Lack Of Viet Nam Support**

“There is little enthusiastic support for the Viet Nam war,” journalist William Worthy told a group of students at an
informal discussion Monday afternoon. Worthy was replying to a question over a comment by Sen. Strom Thurmond, who, while visiting
here last month, claimed the American people were wholeheartedly behind the war. “There is much begrudging support,” Worthy continued. “But
even that is being eroded as things go from bad to worse.” The correspondent for the Baltimore Afro-American drew a
parallel with French public opinion preceding that country’s withdrawal from Indochina in 1954. As things started getting worse and worse,
there was a desire to get out at any cost, he said. “And I don't believe it will take a
51 percent majority before the politicians, especially the congressmen, will begin to take significant action,” Worthy said. The world traveler
pointed out that the war is beginning to reach into every part of the United States and to affect people
all over. “Even in newspapers of the smallest towns you can read about casualties,” Worthy commented.

**Student Council Forms Evaluation Committee**

By BRUCE WEIHE
Davidsonian Staff Writer

A Student Council committee to investigate curriculum and faculty evaluation was tentatively formed at the Student Council meeting Monday night,
with senior representative Ken Autrey as chairman. According to Autrey, the committee would have two main purposes: to work with
Dean of Faculty Frontis Johnston’s faculty committee on course evaluation and to initiate a...Student evaluation of individual faculty members. Concerning
the course evaluation, Autrey said that the Student Council committee "would act only to offer opinions to the faculty committee.
The course evaluation is entirely a faculty project, and if a council member is appointed to the committee, he would
serve only in an advisory capacity, without having a vote." The faculty committee, which will be appointed at the next
faculty meeting, will carry on its investigation concerning curriculum changes next year.

EVALUATION

The faculty evaluation phase will be more in the line of a student opinion poll if it is carried out.
Autrey stated that the results will probably be given to the individual faculty members, and not published for the student
body. Similar evaluations are held at Harvard and other schools, with the results available to the students. "With this evaluation
that we proposed, recommendations concerning class presentation, preparation, and interest can be passed along to the professors," Autrey went on.
"Of course, some professors may not accept the recommendations, but some will adapt to the students' opinions."

PLATFORM IDEAS

Autrey’s proposed committee was part of a Student Council worksheet composed of platform ideas from the recent election. The worksheet
is comprised of council programs entailing two areas: working with faculty committees on student body problems as well as problems
that can be handled without faculty cooperation. The council plans to work with the faculty to examine the Vespers attendance
regulations, looking over the validity of Davidson's Christian commitment and checking ways to express this commitment.

CUT SYSTEM

In the academic area, in addition to Autrey’s committee, the council will also work with the establishment of a free
cut system, the consideration of exam regulations, and other phases. The council will also work with the faculty on academic
scheduling. In student affairs, an evaluation of the social situation and the student body constitution will be held. To improve
student services, there are plans to institute more student exchanges, investigate a free local phone system, and a student discount
project among other things. According to the worksheet, the council plans to consider a plan to abolish compulsory ROTC and
examine job opportunities and wages in campus jobs. There will also be a delegation to the Southern Universities Student Government
Association (SUSGA) comprised of Ben Cannon, John Gresham, and Bill Watson. The convention will be held in Jacksonville, Fla., May
5-7.

Address Changes Due Soon

Students are reminded to make arrangements now with the Post Office concerning summer mail, Postmaster W. B. Mayhew told THE
DAVIDSONIAN this week. "You may come by the service window now and fill out your card to forward your mail
for the summer, noting the effective dates," Mayhew said. The postmaster also reminded students to notify all newspapers, magazines, and
other second-class mails of the change in addresses. He said it would take approximately four weeks for the change in
address to be made. Box rentals may also be made now, he said. Rent is $3.60 per year and must
be paid now in order for a student to retain his same box for the coming year.

ROOMMATES REVISITED

This morning’s mail brought a letter from a student at a prominent Western university (Princeton). "Dear Sir," he writes. "In
a recent column you said it was possible to get along with your roommate if you try hard enough. Well,
I’d like to see anyone get along with my roommate! Mervis Trunz (for that is his name) practices the ocarina
all night long, keeps an alligator, wears knee-cymbals, and collects airplane tires. I have tried everything I can with Mervis
Trunz, but nothing works. I am desperate. (signed) Desperate."

Have you, dear Desperate, really tried everything? Have you, for example, tried a measure so simple, so obvious, that it
is easy to overlook? I mean, of course, have you offered to share your Personna® Super Stainless Steel Blades with
Mervis Trunz? To have a friend, dear Desperate, you must be a friend. And what could be more friendly than
sharing the bounty of Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades? Who, upon enjoying the luxury of Personna, the nickless, scrapeless, tugless,
hackless, scratchless, matchless comfort of Personna, the ease and breeze, the power and glory, the truth and beauty of Personna—who,
I say, after such jollies could harden his heart against his neighbor? Nobody, that’s who—not even Mervis Trunz—especially not today
with the new Personna Super Blade bringing us new highs in speed, comfort, and durability. And here is still a
further bonus: Personna is available both in Double Edge style and Injector style.

No, dear Desperate, your problem with Mervis Trunz is far from insoluble. In fact, as roommate problems go, it is
pretty small potatoes. Compare it, for example, to the classic case of Basil Metabolism and E. Pluribus Eubank. Basil and
E. (once roommates at a prominent Eastern university) were at an impasse. Basil could study only late at night, and
E. Pluribus could not stay awake past nine p.m. If Basil kept the lights on, the room was too bright
for E. Pluribus to sleep. If E. Pluribus turned the lights out, the room was too dark for Basil to
study. Well sir, these two intelligent American kids found an answer. They got a miner’s cap for Basil! Thus, he
had enough light to study by, and still the room was dark enough for E. Pluribus to sleep.

It must be admitted, however, that this innovation had some unexpected sequelae. Basil got so enchanted with his miner’s cap
that he switched his major from 18th Century poetry to mining and metallurgy. Shortly after graduation, he had what appeared
to be a great stroke of luck: while out prospecting, he discovered what is without question the world’s largest feldspar
mine. This might have made Basil very rich except that nobody, alas, has yet discovered a use for feldspar. Today
Basil, a broken man, squeezes out a meager living as a stalagmite in Ausable Chasm.

Nor has E. Pluribus fared conspicuously better. Once Basil got the miner’s cap, E. Pluribus was able to catch up
on his long-lost sleep. He woke after nine days, refreshed and vigorous—more vigorous, alas, than he realized. It was the
afternoon of the Dean’s tea. E. Pluribus stood in line with his classmates, waiting to shake the Dean’s hand. At
last his turn came, and E. Pluribus, full of strength and health, gave the Dean a firm handshake—so firm, indeed,
that all five of the Dean’s knuckles were permanently fused. The Dean sued for a million dollars and, of course,
won. Today E. Pluribus, a broken man, is paying off his debt by walking the Dean’s cat every afternoon for
ten cents an hour.

We, the makers of Personna Blades and the sponsors of this column, will not attempt to expertise about roommates. But
we will tell you about a great shaving-mate to Personna—Burma Shave®! It soaks rings around any other lather; it comes
in regular and menthol.
