### Freshman Advisors

Three teams have signed up to run for freshman advisors in Tuesday’s election. All six candidates are hall counselors and
said they are interested in maintaining contacts with the hall counselor program and increasing the visibility of the freshman advisors
among the freshman class next year. The three teams are juniors David Carr and John Mann; Reaves Robinson and Gordon
Turnbull; and Amy Crittenberger and Mike Mason. Jeff summed up the candidates’ views when he said, “I think anybody on
the list could do a good job.”

The College Hall Counselor’s handbook sets forth the responsibilities of freshman advisors. They include serving on the hall counselor selection
committee, assisting hall counselors, and advising them in strengthening their programs and activities. They also work with the Dean of
Students’ office to plan and conduct the hall counselor training program and freshman orientation. According to the handbook, they should
try to initiate “as much interaction between the freshman class and the upperclassmen [as possible] in order to promote a
closer sense of community,” and integrate “the freshmen into Davidson.” The advisors are also responsible for assisting the Dean of
Students’ office in evaluating the hall counselor program.

Dean of Students Will Terry said freshman advisors are selected and trained through a student process instead of an administrative
one. Dean Terry said freshman advisors need experience, energy, enthusiasm, ideas, and “an ability to encourage people when they get
depressed.”

Associate Dean of Students Sue Ross said that while there is no rule concerning the sex of the freshman advisors,
usually a man and woman run together because the hall counselors they advise are both males and females. John Mann
and David Carr said they will be able to do the job as well as a male-female team could. “I
don’t think that will affect us at all. There’s nothing in this job which requires any type of sex role,
and we’re not going to be living in the freshmen dorms or anything,” John said. He also said the freshman
advisors should be more visible than they have been in the past. Both John and Dave are premedicine majors.

Amy Crittenberger said freshman advisors play an important role in selecting hall counselors, and, “being hall counselors this year, we
are pretty well qualified to make those judgments.” Agreeing with John, Mike Mason added, “In the past, the position hasn’t
been utilized to the extent that it could have been. Direct contact between the freshman advisors and the freshmen hasn’t
been as close as we would like to make it.” Amy suggested that freshman advisors should attend more hall meetings
than they do. Amy majors in political science, and Mike is an English major.

“I enjoyed my experience as a hall counselor this year and have learned a lot from it, and would enjoy
working with hall counselors next year,” Reaves Robinson said. She also said, “I think people with hall counselor experience are
one of the most valuable resources they can have, and I enjoyed working with the Dean of Students’ office.” Gordon
Turnbull added that the hall counselor has one of the most important jobs at the College because the better the
hall counselor is, the better prepared the freshmen are for college life. “It’s the difference between making freshmen feel a
part of the College community and letting them slip through the cracks.”

### Synco Starts Development

$100,000 homes to be built north of Griffith Street

The Synco Company plans to begin construction of housing units at its Davidson Landing Development early in January 1982, according
to Synco.Project officer John Yelberton said the company hopes to have the first twenty units completed by late spring. Synco,
which builds extensively in downtown Charlotte, plans to develop the lakeside land north of Griffith Street, the road that leads
to I-77. Davidson. Langin’s former name was the Turtle Rock Cove Development. The first phase of the development will include
the construction of 39 “patio houses” on 36 acres, Yelberton said. Each unit will sell for approximately $100,000. Synco originally
planned to build 150 housing units on that same tract of land.

Patio houses are free-standing single-family homes separated by courtyards. Because they do not qualify as normal single-family homes, developers must
acquire a special use permit before building them in Davidson or within one mile of Davidson’s city limits, according to
Annamarie Burts, Chairwoman of the Davidson Planning Board. The town granted Synco a special use permit for the first twenty
houses. The rest of the 39 houses in the first phase of the development will not be approved until the
sewer line is complete, she said.

According to Yelberton, the special use permit also provides for narrower roads than would have been built under existing zoning
ordinances. He said that Synco planned the roads “to keep in character with existing Davidson roads.” Present zoning ordinances require
roads wider than most of Davidson’s because the old ones were changed to reflect a state guideline which was adapted
after Davidson’s roads were built. Synco special use permits make several exceptions to the present requirements.

Synco will construct 24 boat slips on the 400-acre lake near the development, said Yelberton. Synco will include in the
Davidson Landing’s Homeowner’s document a requirement that boat motors cannot exceed ten horsepower. They originally planned to put in 72
slips. Before construction can begin, Synco must either complete roads, sewers, and utility hookups, or put up a bond to
guarantee sufficient funds to complete them, Burts said. “If the project is abandoned, this will make sure that Davidson will
not have a lot of mud and half-paved roads,” she explained.

Burts noted “considerable concern or maybe even fear on the part of Davidson residents” regarding the new development. She said
Synco is “concerned about the quality of life at Davidson.” She predicted that the development will not have much effect
upon the prices of existing Davidson houses.

The Lake Norman Company, founded by Synco, is also interested in developing the corridor of land adjacent to Griffith Street.
The Lake Norman Company bought land on Griffith Street with the intention of selling it to clients in light industry.
According to Mr. Currie, Dr. Spencer and the trustees of the College invested $25,000 in the company “as a way
to promote the orderly growth of the Davidson Community” as well as to make a good investment. The Lake Norman
Company and Synco are closely related, although according to Yelberton, the Lake Norman Company is not a subsidiary of Synco.
Burts said that the original special use permit for Davidson Landing was issued in the name of the Lake Norman
Company. Several Davidson alumni work for the company, and Synco’s President is alumnus P. Reitzel Snider.

The College is also trying to promote development on Griffith Street, according to Currie. The College has been trying to
sell its five acres of land on the northeast corner of I-77 and Griffith Street to a firm which would
build a motel “the quality of a Holiday Inn.” This would provide visitors with nearby lodging when the Guest House
is full, Currie said.
