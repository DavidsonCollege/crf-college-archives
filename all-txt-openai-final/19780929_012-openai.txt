**MAGICIAN BILL SPOONER** adds a touch of mystery to Homecoming festivities with his sleight-of-hand skill.

**Have a busy weekend!**

With all the activities on campus this weekend, there is no excuse for having a boring Homecoming. To aid you
in your quest for excitement, here’s a rundown of events going on Friday and Saturday.

The two major “happenings” are, of course, the football game (2 pm Saturday) and the “Asleep at the Wheel” concert
(8 pm Friday). But these are only the beginning.

Friday’s events will start at 4 pm, when there will be a bluegrass band on Rusk’s back porch. After the
AATW concert in Love Auditorium, the action moves to the Union for the grand Casino Party, featuring horse races, blackjack,
and craps, topped off by an auction at which some $460 in prizes will be “sold.”

Bill Spooner, an excellent magician, will provide entertainment at the Casino Party. According to C. Shaw Smith, Spooner is a
widely-known member of the International Magician’s Association and has been often cited for his excellence in “close-up tricks,” using cards,
coins, and dice. In several past appearances at Davidson, he has always astonished his audiences.

For those who would rather dance, two band parties on Friday night fill the bill. SAE hosts “Janice” and “Blacksmith”
will play at the KA house from 10 to 2.

All campus women are invited to Rusk House for a 12-1 pre-game munchie party, and the SAEB’s are holding a
post-game champagne party.

On Saturday evening, three band parties and two discos provide plenty of opportunities for dancing and socializing. ETC brings “Bits
and Pieces” to campus; F&M, Emanon, and PAX co-host “Johnny White and the Crusaders,” and “Deep South” plays at the
Phi Delt House.

In addition, KA will hold a ’50s disco (appropriate dress, please), and PiKA will sponsor an all-night disco starting at
midnight. Saturday’s final event will be a 2 am breakfast in the snack bar—all you can eat for $2.

In the midst of all your Homecoming partying, however, don't forget to set aside a few minutes to say a
prayer for the poor pre-meds. MCAT’s are being held on Saturday. Have a good weekend!

**The Davidsonian**

**‘Asleep’ will wake you**

In the eight years since its formation, Asleep At The Wheel has come to be known as the 11-member aggregation
that gave the musical idiom known as Western Swing—as created by Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys in the Thirties
and Forties—to a new generation of listeners in the Seventies.

From that base, their approach has expanded gradually from album to album to bring into play the band’s other equally
strong country blues, jazz, and Cajun influences.

With such a wide instrumental range as mandolin, sax, accordion, clarinet, and pedal steel guitar, the multi-talented band is sure
to put on one of the most unique shows seen at Davidson.

Asleep At The Wheel defies categorization. But they put on a show well worth seeing. (Love Auditorium, Friday at 8
pm. Tickets are $3 for students, $5 for non-students.)

**Swisher gives concert**

James G. Swisher, a new music professor at Davidson College who has performed internationally as a pianist, will present his
first Davidson piano recital at 8:15 pm Monday, October 2, in Hodson Hall of the Cunningham Fine Arts Building.

Swisher began his piano studies at the age of 5 and earned a bachelor of music degree in 1973 and
a master of music in 1976 from Yale University. He studied with Ward Davenny and Donald Currier and won the
Sprague Hall Competition. For several years he has been artist-in-residence at Merrywood Music School, a summer chamber music program in
Lenox, Mass. He has performed works by Messiaen and Grieg with symphony orchestras. He has also performed in Europe and
South America as a member of the Burle Marx Trio; the other members were both former Yale classmates. Last year
he taught piano at Wesleyan University in Connecticut.

Swisher said he was attracted to Davidson because of “its emphasis on the liberal arts atmosphere, a chance to work
in a small department and branch out and do different things, working with majors and non-majors, and a chance to
play.”

His October 2 program will include Beethoven's “Sonata in E-flat, Opus 81a,” Debussy’s “L’isle Joyeuse,” Schoenberg’s “Sechs Kleine Klavierstücke,” and
two preludes and two waltzes by Chopin.

**JAMES SWISHER** will perform on Monday.
