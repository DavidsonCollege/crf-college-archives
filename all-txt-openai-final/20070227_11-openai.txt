I Object to Dumbledore’s
U.S. Senate Nomination

As last night’s
polls suggested, and
as I feared,
Dumbledore
appears to
have won the
North
HARRY POTTER Carolina
senate race, casting a pall over the
future of my saga and the royalties
of the Rowling franchise.

Who will subvert scheming
ne’er-do-wells like the dark wizard
Grindelwald? Who will assume the
headmastership of Hogwarts? I
think we all remember what hap-
pened to Middle Earth after
Gandalf finally passed the New
Jersey bar exam.

Last night my roommate Fergie
told me that Albus can’t actually
serve as senator because he’s a fic-
tional creation. You’re a fictional
creation, Fergface.

As Wikipedia will verify, Albus
Dumbledore was born in 1881 to
Percival and Kendra Dumbledore.
Educated at Hogwarts, he has held
the position of Chief Warlock of
Wizengamut, as well as The Order
of Merlin, first class. Under
Churchill and later Thatcher he
famously refused the position of
Minister of Magic.

However, Article 1, Section 3 of
the Constitution stipulates a sena-
torial candidate must have been a
U.S. citizen for the past nine years
and a resident of the state he seeks
to serve, thus disqualifying Albus.

I love Dumbledore, but in order
to keep him at Hogwarts I’m will-
ing to divulge the secrets of
Weasleygate, to reveal the identity
of his bastard warlock child, and to
explain Griselda Marchbanks’
comment that “he did things with
his wand I’d never seen before.”

Freshman Feels the Burn
of “Shower Shotgun”

The south bathroom of fourth
Richardson Dormitory is normally
a haven of quiet and privacy, but
for one unlucky freshman, it
became a barren and unforgiving
battlefield.

Tuesday morning, Andre
Kennedy ’11 walked down the hall
with his towel around his waist, his
shower sandals on his feet and a
shower caddy in his relaxed and
unsuspecting hands.

Just as Kennedy whistled past
room 405, the door swung open
and out walked fellow freshman
Vijay Patel, cloaked in a yellowing
bathrobe and toting a single bottle
of AXE shower gel.

Kennedy thought nothing of his
hallmate’s presence, but this would
prove to be a disastrous error in
judgment.

Kennedy entered the bathroom
with Patel close on his tail. The
hooks next to both the middle and
far stalls were sagging under the
load they preserved from sodden
ruin; a pair of boxers and a towel
declared each stall “occupied.”

Moving across the cold tile floor,
Kennedy had all but forgotten
Patel’s stealthy approach. Kennedy
moved closer to the empty stall, but
all for naught.
“Shotgun on that stall!” Vijay
sang as he raced past Kennedy.
Reeling from the blow, Kennedy
simply sputtered and stared as a
dark set of buttocks disappeared
behind a flapping grey curtain.

A rush of water told Kennedy
that he had been vanquished. His
footsteps heavy with defeat, he left
the steamy bathroom. Alone in his
grief, he withdrew to his room for
another fifteen minutes, where he
clipped his toenails and read last
week’s Yowl.
