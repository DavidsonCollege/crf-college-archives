Frank shows coaches that they missed out

After learning that she had been named to the American Lacrosse Conference Preseason All-Conference Team earlier this semester, Lindsay Frank
’05 felt a sense of satisfaction in having proved herself so capably to the coaches who once passed on her.

Frank’s nomination to the All-Conference team, which included players from elite teams such as Northwestern, Penn State, and Johns Hopkins,
among others, was the result of a poll of the league’s coaches, many of whom she had once spoken to
in her college search.

“I was pleasantly surprised,” said Frank. “It was the coaches who voted, and they were all coaches I had talked
to when I was looking at schools. They had all said, ‘We like you, but we have other people in
mind,’ so it was nice to get the recognition after playing for four years, and especially for a program that
hasn’t done as well and improved as quickly as their programs have. It was really exciting and flattering in that
way, especially.”

Frank ’05 has fueled the ’Cats’ attack.

But while thankful for the individual recognition, Frank points to a renewed emphasis on the team concept as a key
difference in the team’s results and performances since the 1-15 season two years ago.

“I definitely think we’ve grown, and I don’t think our record necessarily shows it,” she said. “We’re a different team
now, because we all play for each other. Regardless of the outcome, we go out every game and we know
what we’re playing for. We’ve lost a lot of games this season, but even after the games, we can still
joke around on the bus. We’re not pointing fingers, and we’re not blaming anyone but ourselves. We don’t mix up
lacrosse in our friendship, so even though we’re not winning, it’s been a much better experience.”

Despite the focus on the team as a whole, Frank’s impressive individual performances over the last two seasons are difficult
to ignore. Frank’s preseason honor stemmed from her breakout season last year, when she ranked second on the team in
goals scored, tied for first in total points, and first in ground balls.
