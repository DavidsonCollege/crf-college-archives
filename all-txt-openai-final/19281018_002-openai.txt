One reads of “love powders” that are given to create a deeper love, and that really cause death. They were favorite weapons of the Borgias; Catherine de Medici would have gloated in them. Also, the custom of trying beasts for crimes remains with us. Only the other day, a dog was tried, condemned, and put to death for biting a small child. Twelve men, good and true, formed its jury; a sedate judge administered the sentence. Those “doubters” who may be found among the students on the Hill may be surprised to learn that the law has taken official notice of the evidence of hypnotism. A girl was being tried in Connecticut for burglary; there was no apparent chance for acquittal. Rather suddenly, her counsel produced proofs that she was working under the hypnotic influence of her fiancé. As a result, she was declared innocent and the man was forced to serve her sentence of three years. The thought occurs: How many work under a dominating influence that is not their own?

Let it be said in all justice to the Navy of the United States that it is not the only one to have consistent submarine disasters. All France was recently shocked to hear of the loss of forty-three men, who were on board the submarine Ondine, a vessel of the newest and largest type. It will be recalled that Great Britain suffered a like loss in the last few months. How much longer will the lives of sailors be sacrificed in times of peace? Drill maneuvers must be practiced, but cannot some degree of precaution be taken?

Even though this isn’t baseball season, we have to mention a certain shortstop, called “Ancient Mariner,” because he stoppeth “one of three.”

Mrs.—“She has quite a large repertoire, hasn’t she?”
Mr.—“Oh yes, and that dress makes it look all the worse.”

OPEN FORUM

THAT SPIRIT

One of Davidson’s proudest possessions has been, for quite a while, its fighting spirit, known wherever Davidson is known. Winning or losing, any Davidson man was a Wildcat and was not through fighting until the last whistle had blown. At the two football games played here this year, it would have been difficult for an old friend of Davidson to recognize any fighting spirit. One game we won, and that by such a score that it seemed hard to back the team as fiercely as in a more even contest. The other we lost. And the cheering from the stands was of the same caliber—indifferent, mediocre. It seemed a bit like a picture show audience, where some popular vaudeville act is encored, and for the rest, letting silence reign. Perhaps it is because there have been fewer student body pep meetings than last year. I don’t know. Those in authority that have fewer pep meetings might have a better result, through fear of over-doing it. The cheerleaders seem to have been doing their best, but they certainly have lacked the full support of the school this year. At last Saturday’s game, here and there, was all the cheering that anyone could ask. But for the most part, everyone seemed unwilling to disturb his neighbor. Having girls mixed in everywhere with the student body was one cause. Can we in the future, have the boys who are not with girls sitting together so that we can show the team that they do have any support that we may give? In closing, at least one member of the student body hopes that that Wildcat spirit of which we are so proud—and justly proud—is, at the present, ill and not dead.

OUT OF THE BRIEF CASE

It looks as if celluloid collars are doomed—unless some master publicity man convinces the public that they’re good for halitosis.

“America is slowly developing a race small in stature,” they tell us. Well, what can you expect, considering the number who travel in upper berths each year?

Speaking of trains and such, we’ve often wondered who Mr. Pullman gets to name his cars for him. Reckon he is the world’s highest salaried nomenclator, huh?

Did you notice that no honorary fraternity bids were turned down? Perhaps those opposed to such organizations have suddenly changed their minds—or else didn’t get bids.

It has been rumored that Al Smith passed through Davidson last week. Wonder if there is any truth to that? Herbie and Al are wasting time, seems to us. Why don’t they cut out the speechmaking and handshaking and swim the English Channel or fly across the Atlantic Ocean or something? Why, since this German Zeppelin has been headed this way, you can’t find Mr. Hoover or Mr. Smith mentioned anywhere except in editorials—and who reads those, anyhow?

“This sho am gwine be a powerful lessen to me,” remarked the negro murderer just before the trap was sprung.

MY LAST ROOM-MATE

My last room-mate was an ideal fellow. He wore his own clothes. He was the same size as I, had a closet full of the latest cut suits, and was not stingy with his things. He cleaned up the room each morning, hanging my clothes in their proper place. He made up our laundries on Monday mornings and saw that they got in the hands of Lord Helper for their weekly mangling (Editor’s note: Wonder if Lord Helper don’t make quite a wad on the side, selling buttons?) He knew plenty of women and didn’t mind dating his room-mate with the best. He never failed to keep me from sleeping through classes. He owned a toothbrush, a can of shoe polish, a razor, and had toothpaste of his own. Could find his own bed when coming in after lights at night. Smoked the right brand and always had a carton on hand for us. Was delighted to write papers, work problems, etc., for his room-mate. You can imagine my lost feeling when he passed away. It was a perfect shame. He faded out this morning when my real room-mate awoke me and kindly informed me I had slept through chapel and my first period class.

America is slowly annexing Canada—pint by pint.

Fred Waring, director of the famous orchestra, “Waring’s Pennsylvanians,” failed to make the Penn State Glee Club in his collegiate days because “he didn’t have any musical ability.” Maybe some critics are right about modern jazz not being music, or maybe Fred didn’t own a Tux. Or maybe the director of said Glee Club didn’t size Mr. Waring up just right.

Most people write because they’re paid for writing. Some write to fill up two columns of space each week (under this classification comes the Feature Editor of Davidson's only morning newspaper). But whoever heard of anybody refusing to write when offered one dollar per word for such writing? Some years ago, a young college professor was offered $1,500 (at least six months' salary for him) to write a 1,500-word article for a certain newspaper. He refused, giving as his reason that the standards of said newspaper were not up to his standards. No amount of persuasion could make him consent to write the desired article. Do you think he was foolish for his stand? What would most word-slingers do under such conditions? Frankly, we would buy a new ribbon for this wreck and before long we'd be fifteen hundred dollars richer than we are now. Which means we'd have fifteen hundred dollars and five cents. By the way, we forgot to mention that this young professor was Woodrow Wilson, later the war-time president of his country.

Earl Carroll once made the statement that no man would give up a throne for a woman. True, brother, true—but, remember, the prodigal son didn’t exactly give up his fine home for husks and life among swine.

Contemporary Thought

THE REAL ESSENCE OF EDUCATION
(Charlotte News)

What is it all about, this thing we call education? The Nation is completely and solidly sold on it. That is evident from the amount of money it is dumping into the venture. It is evident, too, from the armies of young men and women who annually are trooping to the colleges and the universities. It is still evident from the zeal and determination with which the masses have taken hold of the idea of free education furnished by the State and are ready to pay rather enormous taxes for the support of it. But what is education and what the basis of it in the ultimate analysis? President Harlan Luther Freeman thinks that “education at its highest usefulness is not to produce men and women who can fill the warehouse, but who can think and live like spiritual beings in the temple of life.” That’s a sensible definition. This amounts to something more than a place in the columns of The American Magazine through idiosyncrasy of occupation or success. It implies an “interpreting mind and conscience that hears the divine whisper in the familiar and sees the common bush aflame with God.” And the small colleges of this Nation, which, with much endurance and self-denial without the funds, to which the character of their work and the common standards of living give them title, if these dynamic centers can furnish year by year a small group of individuals who are its “salt” and its “light,” and they are doing more to save the Nation from decay than a hundred, yea, a thousand, things for which it spends its millions. This is true because reverence, loyalty, and service, which are essential to self-government, are spiritual entities, and come into existence and social action by the release of spiritual energy through the individual man or woman who will open his life to its incoming.

THE OFFER OF THE COLLEGE

To be at home in all lands and ages; to count nature a familiar acquaintance and art an intimate friend; to gain a standard for the appreciation of other men’s work and the criticism of your own; to carry in your pocket the keys of the world’s library and feel its resources behind you in whatever task you undertake; to make hosts of friends among the men of your own age who are to be leaders in all walks of life; to lose yourself in generous enthusiasms and co-operate with others for common ends; to learn manners from students who are gentlemen and form character under professors who are Christians—this is the offer of the college for the best four years of your life.
