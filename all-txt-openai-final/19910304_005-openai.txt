THE DAVIDSONIAN MONDAY, MARCH 4, 1991

HUNDREDS OF INNER CITY PARENTS, UNABLE TO AFFORD MORE UPSCALE LIVE PETS, COMMITTED $4.95 EACH TO GET THE ADORABLE, DEHYDRATED CHIAS FOR THEIR CHILDREN. THEY WERE THE BYPRODUCTS OF A WARTIME EXPERIMENT GONE AWRY. LITTLE DID THE WORLD KNOW WHAT HORROR WOULD BE UNLEASHED BY WHAT STARTED INNOCENTLY ENOUGH. VENTURE CAPITALISTS, EAGER TO IMPROVE SALES OF THEIR LATEST GIMMICK, PERUSED RECENTLY DECLASSIFIED GOVERNMENT REPORTS. SOON, THEY WERE ABLE TO GO TO MARKET WITH...

Many Thanks
As the new Editor-in-Chief of The Davidsonian, I would like to express many thanks to former editors, Mark Puckett and Jay Chaudhuri. Before Jay and Mark took control last year, The Davidsonian was produced infrequently by a limited staff. Mark and Jay have developed a framework through which The Davidsonian has come out almost every week of the school year. They have assembled a fine staff of assistant editors, section editors, reporters, and columnists. The quality of the paper has increased exponentially under their leadership, and they deserve hearty congratulations for their work.

Where Were You?
The SGA hosted a Gulf Crisis Conference last Saturday afternoon. The funny thing is that it was supposed to begin on Saturday morning. Those of us who were there at 10:00 am stood around with our coffee and wondered whether we were the only people on campus who really thought enough about the war to get out of bed on a Saturday. Professors Appleyard, Denham, Gibson, Kaylor, Mahony, and Maydole all prepared talks for the morning information sessions. Due to the general apathy among the Davidson community, however, these talks were left undelivered. Fortunately for those who attended the round table discussion in the afternoon, these and other professors incorporated many of their extremely enlightening points into the conversation. It's too bad that only thirty or so other people got to hear and discuss them. All those who contributed to the conference, especially Sarah Sadowski, deserve thanks for their hard work. These efforts resulted in a productive afternoon of timely, intellectual discussion. It seems sad that, even at such a fine institution as Davidson, intellectual discussion can't get anybody out of bed.

CHAR. THEIR AWESOME IMPROVEMENT ON THE FAMILIAR CUDDLY DENIZENS OF LATE-NIGHT TELEVISION: THE FORMER CHIA CHUMS FOUND DEEP IN THE BOWELS OF THE ANCIENT CITY SEWER SYSTEM, WHERE PEELED LEAD LINING FROM OLD PIPES, YEARS OF TOXIC WASTE DUMPING, AND AN ENDLESS SUPPLY OF WATER CONSPIRED TO TRANSMOGRIFY THEM INTO SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT...

DAY AFTER DAY... JUST ADD WATER...

SAY, ARTIE, AIN'T THE "D" TRAIN SUPPOSED TO COME IN ANOTHER 45 MINUTES?

HEY SWEETIE, THIS BEAUTIFUL, FAITHFUL LOW-COST COMPANION WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH...

THE ENORMOUS CHIAS PROWL THE NETWORK OF SEWER LINES AND SUBWAY TUNNELS BENEATH THE CITY, BALLOONING TO FANTASTIC PROPORTIONS, FRENZIED IN THEIR CONSTANT SEARCH FOR THEIR ONLY ACCEPTABLE SOURCE OF FOOD...

ALL THE VICTIMS...

Clark Blasts Davidsonian Editors
To the “Editors:”
I formally retract my...Previous article from the Jan. 28th issue of the Davidsonian. Yeah, okay, you probably don’t care or can’t remember that piece of journalism, "Tips To Travel By." If that’s the case, then I’m off the hook. Why? Because after you guys got finished “editing,” I couldn’t recognize it. Alright, I take that back. I did recognize it (albeit barely), which was even worse. Look, I’ve only been abroad for 6 months, it’s not like I’ve totally lost control of my native language. So why hack my entire article with clumsy, needless corrections and additions? Take for example the sentence, “Igloo building is not an accommodation option.” I didn’t write this. Ditto for “Thank you Beave,” “La-dee-da,” “ad nauseum.” Furthermore, the grammatical changes did almost nothing other than to totally alter the style. I hate to point out the obvious, but the title “editor” does not give you the liberty to slash and burn your way through my column like you’re on a jungle safari. So at least do me one favor and leave this rebuttal as is. Thanks (not), Janis Clark ‘92

PSA Update from Madrid

To Davidson:

I was amused by the news story in the Feb. 4th issue of the Davidsonian, indicating that American students abroad could become terrorist targets. The headline read: “Students Abroad Could Become Targets.” Well, what a comforting thought for all the Davidson parents who’ve sent junior and missy to Europe. The article also states that the program directors will heed advice, sagacious no doubt, from the State Department. Well, wouldn’t you know it, the State Department has indeed dished out some advice: don’t wear pro-American decals and such, don’t travel in large groups, and, in their infinite wisdom, they’ve advised the students not to chew gum. Believe it! See, according to the sage—I mean State Department—Americans are notorious for chewing gum, and the act of doing such here in Madrid could bring dire consequences. The group here in Madrid got a chuckle out of that one.

Well, we're all doing fine here in Madrid save for a couple of reasons. The dollar, obeying most dutifully Newton’s law of gravity, continues to plummet. And with it, some of our hopes of traveling extensively. Also, we’re experiencing a brutal winter, with temperatures around freezing regardless of the time of day. One member of our group, a hearty Northerner, has even had to wear socks. Well, imagine that. We’ve had occasion to read a great dramatic work, and then attend the performance the same evening. It’s awe-inspiring I tell you. In fact, a certain member of our group was so overwhelmed by a work of art at the Prado Museum, that she literally fainted! I tell no lie. And the food. A gourmand’s delight, a smorgasbord ranging from squirrel and octopus to baby sparrows. Where else but Spain? And for those of you who’ve not answered our letters, get with it, or expect no gifts from here. We send our best and miss you greatly. Bob and Caroline Price, and all you racquetball aficionados, knock yourselves out. I’ve cashed in my racquet for a matador’s cape. We’re enjoying being in a city as culturally rich as Madrid. In our theatre class, Olé.

Assistant Coach Ingram Responds

There are two possible ways of dealing with an unpleasant situation: 1) Play down its importance, ignore it, and hope that everyone will in time forget it... or 2) Address it, present your side of the story and run the risk of igniting a fire unnecessarily. My personality does not allow me to ignore it and hope that it will go away.

There has been much criticism dealt out with regard to Coach McKillop’s handling of the final home basketball game against Campbell University on the 20th of February, 1991. It has been stated that Coach McKillop displayed a disregard for the two senior members of his squad! That he did not recruit them, so why should he care about them! That he is sacrificing seniors and juniors for the sake of his younger players! That he is sacrificing victories now for the possibility of a better chance later on down the road! That the important point is “how you...
