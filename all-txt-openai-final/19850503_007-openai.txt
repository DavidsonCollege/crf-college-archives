**Track Breaks Three School Records In Tournament**

By ANDY BARRON

The Davidson men’s track team finished their season at the Southern Conference meet in Boone last weekend. The team scored
18 points and set three school records at the meet.

The top Davidson performance came from senior Jeff Carter, who won the high jump at a height of 6’8”. Rain
and a lack of competition foiled Carter's attempt at seven feet.

“It was great to finally win after coming close for several years,” said Carter. “The rain made jumping tough, but
I was still pleased with my performance.”

Carter's efforts in the high jump scored ten of Davidson's points. Senior Jay Braun added six points by placing third
in the pole vault at 14’0”. Junior Lon Krempel tossed the discus 140’0” to finish sixth and add one point.
Davidson's final point came from a sixth-place finish by the 400-meter relay team of freshmen Ben MacKay and Robert Sickles
and seniors Braun and David Turner. The time for the relay team was 42.78.

“I was pleased with how the team performed at the meet and throughout the season,” Coach Gwen Harris said. “Jeff
should be really proud (about winning the high jump). Also, Jay set a personal best in the pole vault. The
whole team did well, but these two efforts came in the rain, which makes them that much better.”

The other highlights for Davidson were the three records set at the meet. Sophomore Greg Foreman ran a 1:55.31 in
the 800 meters to break his own school record. Senior John Ponder clocked a 49.51 in the 400 meters to
break the old record set in 1980 by Dick Jones. Finally, the 1600-meter relay team of Sickles, Foreman, freshman John
Lantis, and Ponder ran a 3:23.02 for the third record. Though none of these performances were good enough to score
points, a school record is a school record.

“The fact that we scored 18 points and that both relays did well showed that the team has improved since
last year,” said Foreman. “The freshmen helped a lot this year. The great number of underclassmen on the team makes
me think we will continue to improve next year.”

**Hitters Win**

By EDWIN PAGE

Davidson's hopes for its first Southern Conference baseball crown came to an end last weekend at the SC tournament.

On Friday, Davidson squared off against Marshall, a team that had won 21 of its last 24 games coming into
the tournament. Junior Scott Weaver surrendered a two-run homer in the first and single runs in the third and fourth
innings as the Cats fell behind 4-0. Davidson closed the gap to 4-1 when sophomore David Turgeon’s fly scored Keith
Helfant from third. However, the Cats could do no more damage. Marshall sealed the victory with two runs in the
eighth and three more in the ninth to make the final score 9-1. The loss sent Davidson into the loser’s
bracket where every game was win or go home.

Saturday, the Cats faced host Appalachian State. Turgeon broke a scoreless tie in the fourth with an RBI single, but
App responded in the fifth with a run of their own to tie it at 1-1. In the sixth, the
Cats walked to an 8-1 lead with one out. Turgeon doubled, then Weaver and junior Tim Waters drew free passes.
After another out, sophomores David Depaul, Dan Simonds, and freshman Bill Masse all drove in runs with bases on balls.
Helfant followed with a two-run single, and after freshman Alan Lewis walked, Turgeon collected his second hit of the inning,
driving in two more. Freshman David Fitzgerald pitched into the eighth before sophomore Steve Condon came on to finish. ASU
got a homer in the eighth off Fitzgerald and a single run in the ninth to make the score 8-5.

On Sunday, the Cats’ lack of pitching depth did them in. Condon started but was obviously stiff after his appearance
the day before. He was touched for nine runs in the first, giving Western Carolina a big cushion. Sophomore Billy
Waitsman came in and pitched well, shutting down the Catamounts in innings two through six. The Cats, meanwhile, could manage
only one run in the first and another in the ninth as Western eliminated Davidson 13-2. The Cats ended up
third in the conference.

On Tuesday, the Cats rebounded to drill Gardner-Webb 19-0 and 5-1 in a double-header. Weaver pitched the opener and dominated
G-W. He struck out thirteen batters in only six innings of work, bringing his season total to 86 K's. Ten
Davidson batters had hits, including a home run by Turgeon and a grand slam by freshman Terry Rupp. Freshman Roy
Vilard had four RBIs and Lewis and Helfant each collected three.

In the nightcap, freshman Darryl Bego pitched a complete game, going into the seventh before allowing a hit. Masse scored
three times for the Cats and stole three bases. Helfant had three hits and drove in two runs as the
Cats cruised to an easy victory.

Tuesday's sweep gave the Cats 23 wins, breaking the school record of 21. Five games remain on the schedule. Today,
the Cats take on Florida Atlantic, the Number Four Division II team in the nation, and May 7 and 8
they play UNCC.
