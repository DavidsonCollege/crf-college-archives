Today I overheard an old man praying for strength,

Today I saw a child with no arms

Today I felt the trembling of a woman’s hand

Today you told me you failed a test.

I’m sorry—

The Collector

As DNA joins and replicates, I engage with language and am broadened. I hook up, seize, roll away and become
bigger. We touch terminals again, we meld, and I am bigger still. I look out from my post at all
that is inside and am afraid; frightened as I run my fingers over the bulbous texture of the universe.

I am the worst of derelicts, lawbreakers, and mix-breeds. I am an assassin, a cuss, a cheat. I am a
word. Yes, language too, and quite a bag.

Words writhe as they curl from my pencil. This word and then this one and then this one. Cute little
symbols. Cute little pieces of me. Brain pellets.

John and I decided that we have always been collectors of language. Like greedy little men, we have pushed words,
sentences, and even whole paragraphs into our pockets to look at them later in our hideouts and offices. We held
them up to the light and remembered their peculiar sparkle. We walked down vast corridors pulling big levers and wheels
and hung these stringy symbols on hooks beside other strings of symbols.

Now, in the great warehouses of my mind, these racks extend for miles and on the floor words like snakes
are coiling and wrapping and joining together and with some of them I dialogue with you.
