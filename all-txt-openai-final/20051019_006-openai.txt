#### Music and romance abound in ‘She Loves Me’

By SARAH ROBINSON

Romance is in the air with the fragrant “She Loves Me” as the Davidson College fall main-stage production.

Set in a Hungarian perfumery, the musical (whose story line is that of “You’ve Got Mail”) leaves the audience feeling
good, if not a little bit overwhelmed by cuteness.

The costumes together with hair and make-up present the characters with sharp images that are framed by the set, which
adds more color to this bright show.

The story line is light and airy with one conflict that counterbalances the otherwise fluffy exterior. The end provides little
that is unexpected, with the characters living happily ever after.

The story opens with a typical morning as workers head to the perfumery, wishing that they could be outside. The
rhythm at the beginning was slightly slow and the actors appeared to be relying on their mics; however, as they
grew more comfortable, the actors spoke out clearly and the tempo of the production picked up. I was impressed particularly
with their enunciation during the vocal numbers, which remained a strong feature throughout the entire ensemble.

The cast contains an extremely strong ensemble with the leads providing excellent voices that improved as the rehearsal moved along.
The ensemble works well together and the dance number “A Romantic Atmosphere” is a pleasant diversion, containing a flair that
allows the ensemble to shine.

Each of the leads brought a different characteristic to the show through their solos which the libretto distributes throughout the
leads evenly.

Hanley Smith ’07 and Ryan Creighan ’07, playing lead roles Amalia and George, fill the stage with their presence from
the moment they step onto it. Also, they share a chemistry that provides easy transition from fighting to flirting in
a moment. Smith offers some spunk to her character and it is evident that she allows herself to have fun
in the role. Her voice, as well as her acting, truly shines in “Vanilla Ice Cream.”

Creighan develops his character quite well and uses his body, along with his voice and face, to express the frustration
felt during the early scenes of the show and the title song in Act II.

Lauren Heinz ’07 gives an edge to the show that was appreciated when everything seemed a little too sweet. She
nails solos in both acts due to her strong voice and stage persona, particularly in Act I with “I Resolve.”

To add conflict to the show, Dr. Durwin Striplin of the Chemistry Department brings some wisdom to the stage in
one of the first songs, “Days Gone By.”

Other performances by David Kerns ’08, Stuart Harrell ’06, and Bryant Kirkland ’07 also provide various entertaining songs to listen
to and fine voices to appreciate.

For the actors, the musical has provided an opportunity for them to get to know one another outside of the
classroom.

Josh Carson ’07 said, “It’s been awesome and everything that I thought it would be.” He also cites the many
rehearsals as a wonderful test towards developing better time management skills during his first semester.

Morgan Wright ’07 remembers her freshman experience in “Frankenstein: The Rock Opera” and has enjoyed doing another musical. “I was
really glad to do a musical again, especially with people who were in Frankenstein freshman year—there are six of us,
and it is great hanging out with them.”

Dr. Striplin, who plays the shop owner Maraczek, sees his participation as a once in a lifetime opportunity which shows
him that, “it’s not students anymore, it’s just crew.”

“She Loves Me” runs on Wednesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Friday and Saturday at 8:15 p.m., and Sunday at
2 p.m. in the Duke Family Performance Hall.

Tickets are $6 for students, $9 for faculty and $15 for adults. A $2 discount is available at the Wednesday
and Thursday shows.
