### Hectic Week For The Council

Attempting to follow the Student Council’s wrangling over the elections system this week left most of us going around in
circles. Emerging from one of the most hectic and time-consuming weeks the Council has put in in some time are
several general observations which we feel are worthy of consideration.

While all the members of the Council are of necessity thoroughly familiar with the sections of the Constitution dealing with
the Honor System and Student Body Regulations, there is an understandable, but unfortunate lack of knowledge in regard to the
other, less-often encountered, sections. We feel that every Councilman should make it his business to become thoroughly familiar with the
entire document, simply in order to be able to function intelligently in his elected office.

In addition, there was a crying need Monday night for a parliamentarian on the Council. It was necessary for Phil
Lewis, a spectator whose specialty is this sort of thing, to rule on points of order for the Council to
proceed correctly. Granted that only rarely does the business at hand get sufficiently complicated to require rulings on parliamentary procedure,
but when it does, it is important that the Council have a designated member prepared to settle parliamentary complications.

One of the most glaring deficiencies is that the Council currently must depend on less than its entire membership in
dealing incisively with the knotty questions which it continually faces. One group carries the load of discussion and problem-solving, both
at the trials and regular meetings. The breakdown of representative government is obvious.

It is also apparent that Councilmen have no effective means of determining the prevailing opinion on controversial issues held by
the students they represent. This failure to mirror the views of the represented cannot be charged to the Council. Students
should contact their representatives and see that they understand their opinion on the subject at hand. This is what should
have happened last week with the impending elections system vote, but with a few exceptions, the Councilmen were left to
make up their own minds.

It is highly probable that the real culprit is the system within which we work. At the present time, Councilmen
actually represent no particular group, except nominally the classes or entire Student Body, which elected them. There is no natural
tendency or habit for a student to keep his representative informed. Perhaps it is high time to begin to consider
our entire system of representation, and attempt to find one in which the man on the Council is a direct
agent of the students who elected him.

### Campaigning Plan Must Be Defeated

Out of the recent meetings of the Student Council and the Elections Board have come several new and we hope
progressive reforms in our ancient methods of Student Government elections. Monday of this week, Creighton Peden presented a petition to
the Student Council for further changes in the elections system, which, rather than being progressive, perhaps border on the radical.

Under the proposed amendment to the Constitution, the present sections of the Constitution forbidding combines, solicitation of votes, and financial
expenditures would be deleted. In their place, Mr. Peden would put a weakly-worded paragraph that says in part that the
Elections Board shall “set forth previous to the election period a set of definite and specific rules including clear-cut specifications
of the amount of money that can be spent by or for a candidate; these rules and specifications to be
composed by the Board each year subject to the approval of the Student Council... .”

What Mr. Peden asks for here is frank and free campaigning, unhampered by any rules whatsoever, except those that successive
Elections Boards might see fit to create. The Student Body will be called to vote upon this constitutional amendment in
the near future. This amendment, which would make cliques, combinations, and financial expenditures necessary for a candidate to be elected,
must be defeated. The elections system at Davidson must continue to be regulated by the Student Body Constitution, and not
by the whims of various elections boards.

There is a need, however, to increase student interest in the elections so that they will take the time to
vote. This might be best done by a series of debates and discussions by the candidates, held in the Union
under the auspices of the Elections Board. In addition to creating more student interest, such forums would enable all candidates
to present their qualifications to the Student Body. At the same time, students would have an opportunity to question all
candidates point-blank on specific issues. The end result should be the election of better qualified candidates who more accurately represent
the views of the Student Body. This would correct, to some degree, one of the weakest links in our elections
system—election on the basis of personality rather than qualifications and ability.

### Prodigal Pants Come Home

A friend of ours told us a sad story the other day. Seems he sent one of his best pairs
of pants to the College Laundry back during exams. Two weeks later when he got around to going by for
them, the lady said she was sorry, but there wasn’t anything for that number. Our friend was a mite disturbed.
Pants come pretty high these days to lose ’em in the laundry.

After a couple more weeks of futile waiting, he determined to at least try to collect a little money from
the laundry to help finance another pair. Seems reasonable enough. But when he went down to register his complaint and
asked for reimbursement, the lady produced a little pink tag which was stamped, she said, with the date the pants
were picked up. Apparently, the stamped tag certifies the removal of an item from the laundry, thus relieving them of
any financial responsibility.

Convinced now that someone had picked up the pants by mistake, there was nothing to do but sit tight and
hope the error would be discovered. Last week the pants came home. From the laundry. Said they had found ’em
hanging on a nail in the back. But what about that official-looking certified pink tag? We wonder.

### DAVIDSONIAN POLLS STUDENT OPINION

**Proposed Changes In Election System Are Discussed**

Because of the intense amount of interest among the student body concerning changes in the elections system, The Davidsonian has
interviewed a number of campus leaders, asking them the following three questions:

1. Are you in favor of the proposal to consolidate on one ballot the offices of President, Vice-Presidents, and Secretary-Treasurer
of the Student Body along with the Editors of the three publications? Comment.
2. Are you in favor of the proposal to eliminate from the Student Body Constitution the article prohibiting active and
open campaigning? Comment.
3. Are you in favor of the plan to vote in the Student Union as adopted by the Student Council?
Comment.

Their answers to these three questions are printed below. Note that each answer corresponds to the number of the question
asked above.

**Carl Cooper**

1. No—I feel that setting up the consolidated ballot is a risky precedent.
2. No—But I would like to consider this more fully.
3. Yes—This type of voting would encourage citizenship among the students.

**Dan LaFar**

1. No—It is perfectly obvious that in some cases a man suited to more than one of these offices could
be excluded from running for some particular post. In this way, a man of abilities inferior to one excluded could
be elected. However, the idea of some type of limitation on the number of offices held by a single student
would, in my opinion, ensure the student body of maximum efficiency.
2. Yes—Due to the background of election procedures here I do not feel that open campaigning, party systems, and other
methods of electioneering followed in many similar schools will immediately crop up in our system. I feel that the proposed
changes would evolve into a healthy elections procedure that would greatly enhance the value of our elections.
3. Yes—I am certain that the advantages have been clearly stated numerous times and need not be repeated.

**Gordon Bondurant**

1. No—Our present system has given us good leadership in these offices. This might be sacrificed simply to speed election
by a few days.
2. No—not until a thorough study is made regarding limits on campaigning and methods of enforcement.
3. No—In order to get the largest number of students to vote, voting should continue in chapel. I feel this
is the only way in which we can get a truly representative, non-cliquish vote.

**Vernon Hunter**

1. No—On a campus the size of Davidson's, it would be a mistake to lose the leadership of a competent
person simply because he was defeated in another major activity.
2. No—I am in favor of more campaigning than is presently allowed. However, the proposal advocates a position far more
liberal than that I personally hold. I am in favor of a more moderate amendment which would include more written
regulations that would allow more campaigning yet prohibit the development of unwieldy political machinery.
3. Yes—I feel that the type of voting procedure represented byUnion voting is the best and most realistic means of
balloting during elections. It promises to be a way of stimulating more interest, building a more responsible electorate, and bringing
issues into sharper focus.

Reitzel Snider
1. No—this would prevent a versatile, capable man from having an opportunity to run for the second office of his
choice.
2. No—on a campus as small as Davidson, ill will and personal resentment would run rampant and do irreparable harm
should we choose to openly campaign.
3. No—not enough students vote as it is. I realize that this proposal would eliminate thoughtless, irresponsible voting, but an
office as important as President of the Student Council needs a campus-wide endorsement regardless.

Ed Young
1. No—This creates the probability of conflicts between activities which would be entered by the individual.
2. No—The influence of big fraternities voting as a block would destroy the fairness of the election system.
3. Yes—I think that this proposal is worth a try in that it is likely to bring about a more
interested and alert voter.

John Bernhardt
1. No—The basis of the argument for this proposal is the concept of an office as the culmination of a
personal program of extracurricular work, and not as the spoil coming from being capable and popular on campus. The argument
against it is that most boys do not plan their campus activities with only one goal in mind, and some
certainly are equally capable of working on several different projects. I personally agree with the second view.
2. Yes—We need more emphasis on ideas around campus politics. Politics based on personalities cannot include many people, but the
ideas behind campus life are the concern of everybody. If the campaigning is controlled with respect to expenses and coercion,
the effect on campus interest should be very favorable; this control must be firm, however, to prevent freedom which will
amount to chaos.
3. Yes—There is a definite tendency toward sleepiness and unthinking in chapel, and to move the ballots out of that
environment should increase the interest and thought connected with casting a ballot.

Sonny Ferguson
1. Yes—The proposed system will speed up the elections.
2. No—This proposal would prove to be too costly for certain individuals who would otherwise be the one for the
position.
3. No—The results of this proposal would be less voting on the part of the students.

Bill Bondurant
1. Yes—I am in favor of the consolidation, on the grounds that a consolidation would effectively shorten the present election
period by perhaps two weeks. Moreover, by the tendency in the long run toward “specialization” in one of the publications
or in the Student Government that would follow the adoption of this proposal, more positions would be open to a
larger number of students who would like to enter into these activities.
2. No—Davidson, by the size and closeness of her Student Body, does not need an election system of this nature.
I feel that provision should be made for students to question the candidates on their policies, perhaps in an election-board
sponsored meeting in the Union.
3. Yes—I feel that balloting in the Union and the lobby of Chambers would be a much more efficient method
of voting. This too would shorten the election period, since balloting could be done five days a week. The large
interest already shown in this proposal testifies to the number of students who will take a few extra seconds to
vote.

Bill Fraley
1. Yes—I feel that there will be no conflicts between those running for student body offices and those running for
publication positions.
2. Yes—But there must be a well-thought-out program which will not start before next year.
3. Yes—I realize that this is experimenting, but if it works, it would be a more efficient system and far
less haphazard than the one which is now being used.

Ross Smyth
1. No—The proposed consolidation is based on the assumption that one candidate would not be suited for more than one
job. I do not believe this would be true every year—perhaps never. It would be more feasible to consider the
consolidation of these ballots after nominations had been made. Then the elections board could see whether or not consolidation would
be possible.
2. No—Open elections at Davidson would be practical only if rigidly controlled, and I do not believe that such a
controlled system would be at all successful. It would be better to put more emphasis on issues and student interest
under the present system.
3. No—Moving elections to the Union seems to me an unnecessary complication of a relatively simple election system. I do
not think that this is the right step toward arousing student interest in elections, but that on the contrary, it
will decrease student participation.

FROM THE TOP of the DOME with TOM MORGAN

The Student Council meeting last Monday night showed that all of us need to know more about parliamentary law. This
is even more true if we are going to use it to block a measure desired by a majority of
an assembly. To do such is entirely ethical, for to my mind the primary purpose of parliamentary laws is to
protect minority rights. To use it in this justifiable way, however, puts one in danger of having the law turned
against him. To be ready for such emergencies he should be thoroughly familiar with all facets of parliamentary procedure.

Perhaps it would be in line to suggest a week of schooling in parliamentary law for the new council members
elected this year before they take office. If student interest in Council affairs remains at the high tenor it was
this week, perhaps such training will be a necessity for future council members.

This idea leads to what I think is the primary good to be found in open campaigning. In such campaigning
the student body would learn much more about the qualifications and background of candidates as well as their ability to
express themselves on their feet under fire. Further, in voting on representatives you would learn what type of platform they
would support in the Student Council.

On the other side lies the fact that open campaigning with unrestricted combines would cause political parties to form. This
would cause a rift in the student body between two major factions on campus that would be most unhealthy for
our student body and legendary friendly spirit. Also, this might mean that a coalition of the stronger and larger fraternities
would control all campus affairs. A freshman who did not become a member of one of these groups would have
to throw away all hopes of ever taking an effective part in extracurricular activities. This seems to me too high
a price to pay.

I feel that there is a compromise position. This would be to have controlled campaigning and at the same time
keep rigidly enforced the present laws on combines. By controlled campaigning, I mean forums at some easily accessible place sponsored
by the elections board. At these forums the candidates would be allowed to express their views and answer questions from
the floor. There would be a different forum held for each office. In addition, each candidate would be allowed to
distribute a limited amount of literature. No advantage should be given to the man who could afford to spend more
money on campaigning.

The elections board, however, plans to go ahead with elections this year without waiting to see if Creighton’s amendment to
allow campaigning is approved. That is, we will do this unless there is strong agitation on the part of the
student body to have us wait to see what action is taken on the amendment. We do this because we
feel that even if the amendment is passed, the difficulties involved in putting it into effect could not adequately be
solved this year.

LETTERS TO EDITOR
Reader Answers Opinions On Purposes Of Hell Week

Dear Editor:
It is my opinion that Tom Morgan missed the point in last week's Davidsonian. He gave the impression that fraternity
Hell Week serves one of two purposes: either it builds up the brothers’ egos by tearing down the pledges; or
it promotes “responsibility, dependability, and self-discipline” in the pledges. The first purpose is admittedly bad; the second is not too
realistic. To what extent can a week of work that is compulsive and closely supervised, even if it is constructive,
develop moral strength?

Fraternities may carry on constructive projects, but at least one of their major functions is social activity. The moral character
Mr. Morgan desires is certainly valuable. But most pledges have a more immediate need to feel that they are at
home and accepted. Hell Week can help them in this direction by promoting activity which develops esprit de corps, a
feeling of unity and belonging and interdependence, within the pledge group.
