#### Indian Musicians Enlighten Concert-Goers
By Cara Woodroof, Staff Writer

Indian musicians Pandit Vishwa Mohan Bhatt and Subhen Chatterjee graced Davidson’s Tyler-Tallman Hall last Saturday, April 19. The Indian Performing Arts Association of Charlotte (IPAAC) and the Davidson College Music Department partnered to bring the two musicians to campus.

Pt. Vishwa Mohan Bhatt designed the mohan veena, the instrument he played on Saturday. The mohan veena is a Western Hawaiian guitar modified to make a sound that resembles classical Indian stringed instruments, like the sitar, sarod, and veena. The mohan veena is a tremendous display of creativity; Pt. Bhatt brings together design techniques from the other three instruments, adding some elements that are totally unique. He demonstrated to the audience that most people held the mohan veena flat, but that actually, the instrument makes better sound if one holds it on its side, much like a guitar.

The title Pandit, shortened to Pt., is Sanskrit for “learned.” Pt. Bhatt is a disciple of Pt. Ravi Shankar, a famous sitar player and composer. Pt. Shankar gained much of his international fame from his collaboration with the Beatles. Pt. Bhatt has won both the Padma Shree and the Sangeet Natak Academy award. The Padma Shree is an award from the Government of India for profound contribution to society. The Sangeet Natak Academy award is India’s highest recognition in the performing arts. Pt. Bhatt’s most prestigious award was the 1994 Grammy Award. He won the Grammy along with Ry Cooder for their World Music Album, “A Meeting By The River.”

Subhen Chatterjee also shows marked creativity. He initially based his style of playing on Lucknow Gharana which he learned from his Guru, Pt. Swapan Chowdhury. A Gharana is like an apprenticeship based on a certain style of playing. A guru is a musical instructor, who not only is a guide to proper musical technique but also a life mentor. Subhen learned techniques and ideas from other Gharanas; his ability to combine different musical concepts makes his music special. Subhen plays the tabla, an Indian drum. He has been the tabla accompaniment for many great Indian musicians and has also performed solo. Subhen has been one of very few tabla players to participate in the World Organization of Music & Dance (WOMAD). He has worked with other famous artists, including flutist Paul Horn and David Crosby. He has recently worked with percussionist Sivamani; his work with Sivamani enabled him to create a fusion band, Friends of Drums (FOD). FOD helps less famous but talented musicians gain the stage, and it plans to help old or handicapped musicians who have much to offer to have an opportunity to play music.

The most amazing thing about these two artists is not as much their credentials as their approach to performance. Unlike Western music performances, Indian musical performances are...

#### Steampunk
By Caroline Wood, Arts and Living Editor

There was a time when Steampunk was the exclusive domain of sci-fi fans and comic book readers. Now, fans of the culture vehemently insist that the genre’s anachronistic fusion of old-fashioned technological and aesthetic sensibilities and the modern, even futuristic, lifestyle has become a way of life. Steampunk Magazine (“Our lives as fantastic as any fiction!”) explains that “It’s about ‘steam,’ as in steam-engines, and it’s about ‘punk,’ as in counter-culture.” It assures newly recognized artists (like internet favorite Datamancer) that they are pleased with the recent media attention their subculture has been receiving. They are not satisfied, however, with the exclusive focus on Steampunk’s concrete material culture, arguing that Steampunk artists are live art rather than simply fans who collect pretty things.

The creative items artists turn out are fascinating: clothes studded with bolts and cogs, household items paneled in stained wood, and gadgets trapped up with watch gears. Crafters strive to make their world a timeless, brazen place. Self-proclaimed “techno-fetishists,” many take particular delight in antiquating the most modern technical apparatuses, from personal computers and laptops to television remotes, cars, and even RVs.

Like most subcultures, the world of Steampunk thrives on the internet, where websites tout new industrial designs, bloggers disseminate their ideas, and steamsters investigate the newest events and developments. Hieronymus Isambard “Jake” von Slatt, steam hero and proprietor of the...

Richard Nagy tinkering with newly refurbished Steampunk gadgets.Improvised and change each time. Musicians have to be consistently creative. If a musician is accompanying another, he must be very attentive to the decisions the musician he is accompanying will make. Pt. Bhatt and Subhen clearly communicated with one another using body language while they were playing. Pt. Bhatt might give a firm nod to let Subhen know that he should hit the tabla drum hard. Subhen would look back at Pt. Bhatt and nod again. They consistently maintained eye contact and seemed to move in sync. As Dr. Stasack, Chair of the Davidson Music Department, said before the performance, Subhen plays the tabla in a very special way; in his hands, the tabla takes new form. The tabla is not played with sticks; the hand directly strikes the drum head. Subhen seemed to have a natural ability to move his hands on the drum to make the perfect sound. His playing transcended simply obeying rhythm or dynamics. He seemed to let the perfect micromovements come out of his own heart. Pt. Bhatt showed off the endless musical expressions of his mohan veena. He could strum the mohan veena fast and loud to create the effect of excited rush. He could slide up to piercingly high tones. It was especially moving when he came to a very high tone and slid between microtones. Microtones are tones between recognized notes. High microtone sliding gives a powerfully melancholy effect. Sometimes Bhatt and Subhen pounded out loud notes together and nodded with the pulse; at these times, they resembled rock musicians strumming to a hard pulse. The audience became especially active at these times. Some audience members rolled their heads around, shook their heads, or nodded. In Indian culture, shaking one’s head can mean one is struck with the beauty of the music. The performance was three hours long, very long for a Western concert but typical for many Indian pieces. One of the pieces Bhatt and Subhen played was one hour and fifteen minutes, not an unusual length. The pieces often contained both meditative, quiet and loud, rapturous parts. The musicians tended to build, getting louder and faster until they came to high virtuosity and a sense of rapture at the finish of a piece. Pieces express a specific mood or situation. One piece they played depicted the emotion of being away from someone you love. Another rendered a springtime sensation. For the last piece in the performance, Pt. Bhatt announced that they would play his Grammy-winning piece. The audience mysteriously failed to clap, and befuddled, he said in a thick Indian accent, “No clapping?” The audience realized their mistake, laughed, and proceeded to give him a hearty applause. They were so spiritually moved, a Grammy really didn’t seem that important anymore. Judging by his smile though, Pt. Bhatt still was very proud of the award.

Steampunk Workshop has acquired an enthusiastic coterie who eagerly await the unveiling of his every project, all exercises in disguising the ugliest of twenty-first-century gear. Inventor and mad scientist Richard R. Nagy has entitled his favorite PC project The Nagy Magical-Movable-Type Pixello-Dynamotronic Computational Engine: a Retrofuturist Steampunk Computer Case Modification. Fans of such innovation have plenty of literary fodder. Now on its fourth issue, Steampunk Magazine has been delighting lovers of neo-Victorian art, craft, fiction, and thought since last September. Visitors to the magazine’s website are greeted with a Steampunk manifesto praising our glorious past of mechanical idiosyncrasies and monstrous, capricious machinery. An enemy of the “fascism of copyright,” the magazine offers free printable downloads of its entire layout. The publication is covered under the liberal Creative Commons license. The world of music isn’t safe either. In keeping with a movement celebrating the glories of “retro-futurism,” steampunk musicians infuse epic classical themes and classic rock songs with electronic “Victorian-synth” and phonograph static. Vernian Process’s “The Symphonic Collection” features synthesized versions of the creepiest and most fantastic in concert music, including the likes of Saint-Saens’ “Danse Macabre” and Mussorgsky’s “Night on Bald Mountain.” Other albums include covers of Depeche Mode, Joy Division, and The Cure and original works with names like “Empire Lost” and “The Elegance of Espionage.” The covers of Holst and Bach feel empty and reductive, obviously stripped of their symphonic richness, and even original songs feel more atmospheric than musical. That atmosphere, however, is addictive.
