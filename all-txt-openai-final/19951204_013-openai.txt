UNUSUAL ART

The Owling Table Series display leaves observers questioning

By Mary Towes ALLISON
Staff Writer

Before even beginning this article, let me say that I think art is a wonderful form of expression and that judgment of it is definitely in the eye of the beholder. The James Bumgardner exhibit in the VAC is... interesting (from my point of view). Probably not something I’d want to hang in my living room at home; but nevertheless, an engaging conversation piece.

The paintings are all oil in this collection whose name, The Owling Table Series, is as unique as the paintings themselves. The colors are bold with a mixture of blue, green, orange, white, and red. A cardinal trait in all of Bumgardner’s paintings seems to be the omnipresence of a pink figure (from what I could gather, it was the likeness of a woman). There are owls painted discreetly somewhere in all of the paintings. Their significance, I’m not quite sure of. There may be some influence of taxidermy in the paintings but I don’t know what kind of interaction stuffed owls would have with pink women. There’s something to think about if you get tired of studying. I haven’t spent a lot of time pondering it, but it would probably be pretty funny if somebody did.

One thing I did like a lot about the paintings, whether they were about taxidermy or not, was that they were cheerful. They really brightened up the gallery and even though they were violently abstract, I felt peaceful looking at them and wondering about the symbolism that existed (if any) in the art. Pretty neat stuff. I encourage anyone to go over to the VAC and check it out. If you haven’t been to the Visual Arts Center yet, go, regardless of your desire to see Bumgardner’s work. The VAC is a work of art in itself, and those who work there are equally as pleasing.

Upon entering the gallery, I took a gander at the information plaque the VAC has about the featured artist and the art; unfortunately, it didn’t help me decipher exactly what the paintings meant, but the interesting tidbits of information supplied were worth reading. James Bumgardner, the painter behind The Owling Table Series, is a native North Carolinian who studied in New York City under notable artists Milton Avery and Hans Hofman. The Owling Table Series was completed in 1959; to view the collection is unique because many of Bumgardner’s works were destroyed in a studio fire. His works are currently displayed not only in our fine arts facility but also in the Virginia Museum of Fine Art in Richmond, the Chrysler Museum in Norfolk, Virginia, and the North Carolina Museum of Art in Raleigh, from which Davidson received the works on loan. The artist is currently a professor at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond; he has taught there for thirty-eight years. Davidson has also bought a small piece of Bumgardner’s art called Pink Nude #4. I must say that this is one of the more tame (and most appealing to me, if it matters at all) of the paintings shown. It looks more like a landscape than anything nude, and doesn’t appear to be a part of The Owling Table Series.

Southwest Grilled Chicken gives pizzazz to your palette

By Ros Kosick & Jay SHULTZ
Chefs-in-Residence

Over Thanksgiving break we traveled to Texas in search of the ultimate southwestern dish. I think we found it. This recipe will add a little spice to your ordinary grilled chicken. To begin you will need the...Following ingredients:
- 4-6 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 1 cup of chunky salsa (mild, medium, or hot)
- 1/4 cup Dijon mustard
- 2 tablespoons of lime juice or juice from a large lime
- Small container of sour cream

Mix the half cup of salsa with the Dijon mustard and the lime juice in a large bowl or baking dish. We recommend using hot salsa. Rinse the chicken under cold water, removing any unwanted fat. Place chicken in the mixture, making sure the chicken is well coated. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least thirty minutes. Preheat grill and cook chicken about 5-7 minutes a side over medium heat. Top each piece of chicken with a tablespoon of salsa and a little bit of sour cream if desired. A piece of lime may also be added for decoration and for squeezing over the chicken.

A great appetizer to go with this dish would be nachos smothered with melted cheese. If you haven’t figured out how to melt cheese over nachos in your oven, then we hope you have about five dollars on your cat card so you can get nachos at the outpost. As a side dish, we recommend white rice, or if you are really fancy, maybe a baked potato. I know it is December and it is hard to grill out in the cold, but this week looks to be pretty nice, so go out and give this recipe a try. ‘Til we cook again!
