“THE DAVIDSONIAN, MAY 31, 1926

Omicron Delta Kappa Numbers All Campus Leaders on Rolls

Omicron Delta Kappa, the national leadership fraternity, was founded at Washington and Lee University in 1915. The local circle, Delta,
was established at Davidson in 1917. Since that time, prominent alumni and students who have attained the highest position in
their respective fields of activity have been initiated.

The fraternity was founded to create a national honor society, which would be significant of campus leadership in any and
all branches of college activity; which, through its local circles, would act as a clearing house for the exchange of
ideas; which would practically mold college opinion (by virtue of the fact that its membership is composed of the leaders
from all interested groups); and which would, by the exchange of ideas at conventions, in the national publications, and at
sectional meetings, provide better intercollegiate feeling and understanding.

The local circle has initiated men this year of the highest caliber, men that are representative of Davidson and of
the organizations in which they have sought the highest position and have obtained it. T. S. Baker, president of the
student body, and star linesman on the Wildcat eleven for the last three years, is undoubtedly one of the most
representative men initiated this year. Last spring he was elected to the presidency of the Athletic Association, but when N.
E. Sappenfield was forced to withdraw from school for half a term, due to an injury, Baker was chosen to
succeed him as leader of the student body.

R. B. Parker, president of the class of '26, has also made more than one notch for himself in the
Davidson hall of fame. Besides leading his class most successfully during the past year, he was also president of the
Metropolitan Literary Society, an inter-collegiate debater, member of five honorary fraternities, on the Honorary Fraternity council, and various other honors,
too numerous to mention.

A. H. Hollingsworth, Jr., president of the Y.M.C.A. for the past year, has also been a leader in more than
this one activity. Besides leading the “Y” through a most successful year, Hollingsworth has been on the varsity debating team,
winner of the Junior orator’s medal, and chosen as the best orator in the school to represent Davidson in the
peace oratorical contest. He is a member of Phi Beta Kappa, and several other honorary fraternities.

R. W. Graves, who has led his class for the past two years in scholarship, is another whose activity has
not been confined to one field. He is a member of Phi Beta Kappa and is national president of Sigma
Pi Sigma, honorary physics fraternity. He was also a member of the student council, several other honorary fraternities, and secretary
of his class.

Turning to the more athletic members of the class and of Omicron Delta Kappa, G. F. Laird’s name appears at
the head of the list. A member of the football and baseball teams for three years, and captain of the
basketball team, his record shines as one of the most brilliant of any Davidson athlete for a number of years.
He was selected as the best all-around athlete his Sophomore year at Davidson, by being given the Norris trophy cup.

Another Norris cup winner is H. Vance, who has also made a brilliant athletic record at Davidson, being a member
of three varsity teams and being given the Norris trophy cup for the past year. F. W. Alford, captain of
the baseball team for the past season, one of the most successful experienced in a number of years, has also
proven his worth over again as a baseball player. “Red” Anderson, of the track team, is another worthy member of
Omicron Delta Kappa and noted athlete.

L. B. Huie has made a name for himself during the past seasons of baseball and basketball, winning his letter
in both sports. He was also cadet major of the R.O.T.C. battalion and a member of Scabbard and Blade. Two
varsity managers have their names on the roll of the local circle, these being E. K. Regen, football, and J.
M. Garrison, basketball. Regen is a member of Phi Beta Kappa, while Garrison is a member of the “Y” cabinet
and holds several other positions of honor.

In the line of publications, H. L. Shaw, Jr., editor of the 1926 “Quips and Cranks,” and a member of
Phi Beta Kappa, as well as an intercollegiate debater, holds quite a position of worth. C. F. Smith, editor of
The Davidsonian for the past year, is a member of O.D.K. and is president of the Dramatic Club. C. F.
Monk, ex-editor of The Davidson College Magazine, was also a leader and a member of the “D” club during the
past year. L. L. Deck, business manager of the 1926 “Quips and Cranks,” was also judge of the Court of
Control.

D. G. Wilson, vice-president of the Senior class and president of the Glee club, is a prominent O.D.K. Nick Sappenfield,
ex-president of the student body, was one of the first members of 1926 to achieve this coveted distinction.

Local Military Unit Finishes One of Most Successful Years in History Here

The year just closed has been the most successful in the history of R.O.T.C. at Davidson College, whether viewed from
the number of students enrolled, the quality of the work done, or the interest displayed by the students. It has
been a banner year in every respect, and this success has been due in a large measure to the enthusiasm
and the untiring efforts of the Professor of Military Science and Tactics, Capt. George H. Weems, and his excellent staff,
Capt. R. D. Daugherty, Capt. J. W. Elkin, and Lieut. R. C. Beckett. The battalion, the student body, and the
college owe the men of the R.O.T.C. staff a debt of gratitude. They are here only temporarily, being detached from
regular duty for a limited time, but they promptly absorbed the spirit of the college, displayed a keen interest in
every activity of college life, and have rendered valuable service in many departments.

Captain Weems has in three years built up one of the best college wrestling teams in the South. Captain Elkin
has started along the same line in boxing, and has also given very good instruction in track for those preparing
to go to camp. Captain Daugherty and Lieutenant Beckett have the rifle teams and have developed much interest and uncovered
real ability in this field. All of the officers have served as judges for various competitions and events.”ath- Also, in
coached athletic contests on several occasions. In addition to giving their personal services, they have been most accommodating in lending
equipment to the Dramatic Club and other student organizations. In the matter of size, the battalion has increased by 43
members over last year, the total enrollment of this year being 455 as compared to 412 for last year. Of
the 455, 56 are in the advanced course. On Wednesday morning, May 12, the final formation of the battalion was
held. At that time the trophies and medals won during the year were awarded, and the Seniors and those receiving
awards received a parade led by the Junior officers. Col. Wade H. Harris, editor of The Charlotte Observer, was present.
Other persons of note present for the occasion were: Captain Barbin, of Charlotte, instructor in the National Guard; Kopas, of
Charlotte, instructor in the engineer company of the National Guard; Lieutenant Bryant, Sixth Field Artillery, Fort Bragg; Capt. Reid Morrison,
ex-captain of the Field Artillery; Col. J. W. MacConnell, of Davidson, colonel in the Medical Reserve Corps; Lieutenant Secretary Clarence
Kuester, of the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce; and Prof. A. Currie, of Davidson, who, on behalf of the Davidson faculty,
congratulated the winners of the awards and expressed his appreciation of the work of the R.O.T.C. Department. The following awards
were made:

U Company, Cadet Capt. B. Ratchford, commanding, a silver loving cup given by the Scabbard and Blade for the best
company in the battalion; first platoon of “A” Company, Cadet First Lieut. C. E. Houston, commanding, a loving cup given
