**Professor Limone Collins Joins Davidson Faculty**

Another addition to the College faculty this year is biology Professor Limone Collins. Collins comes to Davidson from Johnson C.
Smith in Charlotte, where he was the Vice President of Academic Affairs for 11 years. Here at Davidson, he is
currently teaching a seminar on Cardio-Vascular Physiology and will teach Biology 31 next term.

Collins began his career by earning a B.S. in biology with a minor in chemistry from Prairie View A&M in
Texas. From there, he went on a Danforth Fellowship to the University of Iowa. He began teaching in 1953 and
has been at it off and on since then.

For the future, Collins says his academic goals are in research. In his years in administration at J.C. Smith, he
was away from the laboratory and now looks forward to returning. He claims that physiology is a subject that must
be studied from the laboratory, and he enjoys this part of his work, evidenced by the nine times he has
published articles.

Outside of his academic work, Collins and his wife, Billye Jean, keep very active in the community. He serves, or
has served, on the board of the American Red Cross, Goodwill, and the allocation committee of the United Way. His
wife serves on many boards, including the YMCA, where she has recently become the first black president.

Perhaps Collins’ greatest source of pride is his family, though. He mentioned that biology “ran” in his family, citing the
fact that his two sons are both doctors, and his daughter is a hospital administrator.

Since his arrival here, Collins says he is not surprised by what he has found. “I continue to believe what
I’ve read about Davidson College being one of the top ten liberal arts colleges,” he said. Coming from Prairie View,
he is used to the small-town atmosphere. He says that in his heart, Davidson is the kind of setting that
he enjoys.

**Professor Williamson Gets NSF Grant**

The National Science Foundation has awarded a $100,000 grant to support Biology department Chairman John Williamson’s research into metabolic rates.
Williamson has recently received the largest research grant ever awarded to an individual faculty member here.

Williamson will use the grant over a two-year period to “look at the regulation of enzyme activity by genes other
than the structural genes or modifier genes,” he said. The study will include the use of *Drosophila melanogaster*, also known
as fruit flies, and will indicate, if all goes well, the role of the modifier genes in metabolism.

An exciting feature of the project will occur in the participation of three Davidson students as “hands-on” research assistants, according
to Williamson. He added that he will devote a large amount of the funds to the purchase of a centrifuge
for the Biology department. Once he finalizes the research, the centrifuge will become College property, Williamson said.

Williamson came to Davidson in 1981 (“I’m a senior,” he said) with the idea of undertaking a research project here.
He submitted his proposal to the Research at Undergraduate Institutions of the NSF on Dec. 30, 1983. This idea has
“never been explored before,” he said. He was notified of the award on Sept. 7, and he said his initial
response was one of “quiet elation.”

He is excited about the idea of getting Davidson students involved in such projects and added that after the completion
of this two-year study, he will continue to study this topic. He plans to apply to renew the study with
the NSF, which will result in another nationwide search for research funds.

**Charles L. Brown To Speak Here**

Charles L. Brown, chairman of the board and chief executive officer (CEO) of the American Telephone and Telegraph Co. (AT&T),
will speak at 7:30 p.m. this Monday in the 900 Room. Brown, who guided AT&T through its massive corporate divestiture
in 1983, will speak on the subject of “Who Killed Ma Bell and Why.” Following the talk, he will be
the guest of honor at a reception in the Morrison Room.

Brown, who has been the company’s chairman and CEO since 1979, began at AT&T in 1946 as a $13-a-week cable
layer. Since such an inauspicious beginning, he has served as president of...Illinois Bell Telephone Co., and as executive vice president,
vice chairman of the board, and president of AT&T.

—NEWS SUMMARY—

An outspoken critic of AT&T's 1983 breakup, Brown, 62, serves as a director of Chemical New York Corp., E. I.
du Pont de Nemours and Co., and General Foods Corp. Following his graduation from the University of Virginia, where he
received a B.S. degree in engineering in 1943, Brown served in the U.S. Navy before joining AT&T. His son, Charles
A. Brown, is a 1970 Davidson graduate. Sponsored by the Speaker’s Committee, Brown’s speech is open to the public at
no charge.

“Sounds of War” To Be Performed

“Sounds of War,” a musical program on American war ballads, will be performed at 8:15 p.m. this Wednesday in the
900 Room. Including songs as diverse as “The Star-Spangled Banner” and “Blowing in the Wind,” the presentation traces the development
of American attitudes toward war, from 1776 through the Vietnam era. Dr. Sherrill V. Martin, coordinator and lecturer for the
program, is a musicologist and an associate professor at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington. In addition to serving
as chairman of the Albert Schweitzer International Music Awards, she is national musicology chairman for the “American Music Teacher” and
in 1980 was one of seven Americans honored by the National Federation of Music Clubs for her lectures and concerts
on American music.

Four soloists will join Martin in the program: Jane Mathew, soprano; David Bass, baritone; Robert Nathanson, guitarist; and Joel Harrison,
pianist and lecturer in music at Davidson. Mathew, an assistant professor of voice at UNC-Wilmington, earned a master of music
degree from Indiana University. She has been a soloist with orchestras and choral groups throughout the Midwest and Southeast, and
in 1980 gave a series of duo-recitals with noted Metropolitan Opera tenor John Gilmore. Bass, also of Wilmington, has been
active with operatic performances in both North Carolina and Florida. Recently, he has been a soloist with the UNC-Wilmington Orchestra.
An instructor of guitar at UNC-Wilmington, Nathanson is a popular concert guitarist, having performed more than 300 concerts in the
last five years. He has assisted two of America’s most eminent guitarists, Christopher Parkening and Michael Lorimer, and is currently
recording an album titled Exposure. Harrison, a graduate of Myers Park High School and a lecturer in music at Davidson
College, received his undergraduate education at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and holds a master’s degree with
distinction in music from Indiana University. A noted concert pianist, he debuted in Carnegie Recital Hall in 1982 and regularly
performs in North and South Carolina and throughout the Northeast. A part of the Chamber Music Series sponsored by the
Davidson College Music Department, the concert is open to the public at no charge.

SGA To Start Statue Of Liberty Fund Drive

A fund drive to raise money for the restoration of the Statue of Liberty will be held Monday through Friday
of next week. An SGA committee which was appointed to direct the project has established a goal of $1,986, or
$1 from every student, faculty member, and administrator. Sophomore Mark Sandy, who co-chairs the SGA committee with sophomore Christie Johnson,
said, “The drive is purely altruistic... we think it is something everyone will want to support.” The goal of $1,986
corresponds to the year 1986 which is the centennial of the statue’s placement in New York harbor as well as
the projected year of the completion of the renovation campaign. A national restoration committee appointed by President Ronald Reagan has
set a contribution goal of $230 million which is approximately $1 from every United States citizen. The project will rely
solely on private donations with no federal government support. According to Sandy, the committee considered offering prizes for the houses
with the most contributions but decided against such incentives. “It’s much more meaningful if everyone gives a little to save
something that we all enjoy,” he said. SGA members will take donations in Chambers Monday through Wednesday from 9 a.m.
to 4 p.m. Next Thursday and Friday, solicitors will go to Patterson Court houses for collections. “We want to provide
everybody with an opportunity to give,” Sandy said.
