**Cats Fall To Western Carolina**

By STEVE BYERS

Davidson squandered an opportunity to take sole possession of second place in the Southern Conference as the Wildcats lost a
58-57 thriller at Western Carolina last night. Thanks to The Citadel’s upset of Marshall on Wednesday, Davidson (4-3, 8-12) needed
a win in Cullowhee to replace the Herd in second place in the league. Unfortunately, the Cats didn't get it.

Freshman point guard Derek Rucker, who finished with 13 points, missed a short jumper with three seconds left that would
have won it for Davidson. Rucker’s shot was set up by Vincent Walker's missed free throw with 20 seconds remaining.
The Cats worked the ball around until Rucker put it up from near the foul line. Time ran out as
a wild scramble ensued for the rebound.

There were no last-second heroics for Rucker this time (a la Appalachian State), but he didn’t need any last-second shots
against The Citadel. After the Wildcats had disposed of South Carolina, they returned to the friendly confines of Johnston Gym
last Saturday night to battle The Citadel. Only it wasn’t so much a battle as it was a one-man show.

Rucker had shown everybody that he could run a spread offense and shoot free throws when it counted in the
South Carolina game. Now it was time to show what else he could do. Namely penetrate, pass, block shots, steal,
and shoot. Rucker finished the game with 31 points, seven assists, five rebounds, and four blocks. Rucker’s performance keyed the
Cats to a 102-92 victory over the Bulldogs.

Obviously, it was a big offensive night for Davidson. The Cats shot 67.5% from the floor for the game, picking
up right where they left off at South Carolina. Included in that number was Rucker’s hot hand — he hit
10 out of 12 from the field. Overall, Davidson played inspired basketball. At one point, midway through the second half,
the Cats had opened a lead of 26 points at 70-44. But after that, things got a little sloppy and
a lot boring. The game deteriorated into a foul shooting contest between the two clubs in the last seven minutes.

Being named conference player of the week as a freshman happens about as often as Dr. J missing a slam
dunk in the open court, i.e., seldom to none. That same player's leading the team in almost every offensive category
is another athletic wonder. Nevertheless, Davidson’s own six-foot, 160-pound point guard Derek Rucker has managed to do both.

After 19 games on the college level, the freshman from Cleveland leads the team in points (13 per game), minutes
played (34.3 per game), assists (75), and steals (40). He also is shooting 53 percent from the field and 82
percent from the free throw line and has six blocked shots. His statistics last week bear the mark of a
budding star. Against The Citadel, he converted 10 of 12 field goal attempts and 11 of 12 free throws for
31 points. In the Cats’ upset win over South Carolina, he scored 19 and had no turnovers.

“Impressive, but not All-America-type accomplishments,” you say. Well, what makes his rise to prominence such a novelty is that Davidson
was the only Division I school that seriously recruited him. Although Furman, Iowa, and Columbia showed some interest, it was
the Elons, the Johnson C. Smiths, and the Gardner Webbs of college basketball that beckoned his services the most. Chalk
one up for the Davidson recruiters for finding such a gem.

“We knew all along that he had the court savvy and the intelligence to contribute immensely to our program,” said
Coach Bobby Hussey. “We knew that he was the type who could handle those pressure situations without being rattled. But
what was a pleasant surprise was his ability — despite a lack of strength and physical maturity — to stand
up to Division I basketball.”

**Instinct Leads To Rucker’s Success**

Derek Rucker shows off his style

Was Rucker himself surprised? “Maybe a little bit,” he said, “but I just felt that if Coach Hussey gave me
a chance, then I could perform well.” ... Well enough perhaps to be the team’s most valuable player through the
first twenty games of the season. Said sophomore redshirt Todd Scott, “He's made the difference in our ball team, I
think. He can dish it, shoot it, and handle it. He’s a complete package.” Part of that package has been
an acute sense of basketball instinct which almost seems...to propel the team. “He's the consummate point guard,” said Wildcat enthusiast
Steve Soud. “He knows what to do at all times: pass, shoot, or dribble. Sure, I think he’s been the
MVP so far.” But both he and Hussey shun such Rocky Kmiecik accolades. “It's definitely been a team effort,” Rucker
said. “No, there aren’t any stars on this team,” Hussey said. “This is the most balanced, deepest team we've had
since I’ve been here.”

Quickly becoming Rucker's trademark is a move for which he alone has the patent: he jukes left, spins right, and
pulls up at the foul line for the jumper. You can count on it like you can count on a
bad grade in physics. Now before you say “basketball god,” Rucker, whose nickname on the team is “Papa Smurf,” still
has much to learn. “Defensively, he has a long way to go,” says Hussey. “He tends to force the action
a little too much. But Derek is a perfectionist. If he makes a mistake, he’s the first to know it.”

Not only was there a steady parade to the foul line, but Davidson's reserves were unable to do much of
anything offensively or defensively. Finally, Hussey was forced to reinstate his regulars to preserve the lead in the closing minutes.
Embarrassing, perhaps, but necessary. Anyway, the Cats did hold on, but Rucker wasn't the only reason. Junior Pepper Bego came
off the bench to score 17 points in only 18 minutes, while junior Gerry Born played his usual solid game
with 13 points and a game-high nine rebounds. The Citadel's Regan Truesdale led the losers in scoring with a quiet
(if that’s possible) 29.

Well, Davidson returns home tomorrow night to begin a homestand. Saturday night's opponent is red-hot UT-C. Coach Murray Arnold's Moccasins
are the surprise of the Southern Conference so far this season, and they come to Davidson in first place with
an 8-0 record (15-4 overall). Monday night the Cats face a shell-shocked Appalachian State club in Charlotte. On Wednesday, Davidson
hosts Furman. UT-C looks safe in first place, but second place is definitely within Davidson's reach. But to wind up
there, the Cats need two, maybe three, wins this week. Davidson always plays UTC tough in Johnston Gym, and it
should be a great game. But the ASU and Furman games are must-wins if the Cats are to stay in
the league race.

Despite Losses, Women’s Team Shows Improvement
By DWAYNE D. WRIGHT

Have you seen the Lady Cats play lately? If you have, then you know that they are a much-improved team
compared to last season. The Lady Cats, after thirteen games, have a 3-10 record, although two of the wins resulted
from forfeits. There is a visible improvement in their play. After 10 games last season, the Lady Cats averaged 33.2
points per game; this year, after 10 games, they were averaging 61.6 ppg. However, while their offensive output has increased,
the team still has problems stopping opponents from scoring. Coach Pat Daley said, “Defensively we are better but not consistent
and we could be more aggressive.”

Monday afternoon, the Lady Cats were simply outmanned by Stetson University. The taller and quicker Hatters outrebounded Davidson, 44-13, and
had 15 steals en route to a 106-46 victory. The Lady Cats did not attempt a single free throw during
the game. Sophomore Mary Griffith led the team with 14 points. Junior Amy Hartman and sophomore Heather McKee contributed 10
points apiece. The Presbyterian game was more of the same as the Lady Cats lost 105-45. The quicker Presbyterian team
capitalized on 29 Davidson turnovers.

Coach Daley is looking at the upcoming week with cautious optimism. “We can win three out of four games next
week if we play the best we can,” Daley said. Tomorrow's game with Greensboro College could be the team’s next
win, according to Daley. “It's within our reach; it’s the type of game that we can win if we can
control the tempo.” Until the Stetson game, the team’s leading scorers were McKee with 17 points per game, Hartman with
11.6, and Griffith with 11.4. McKee led in rebounds, hauling down 6.9 boards per game, and Hartman led in assists
with 6.5 per game.

The Lady Cats have improved greatly since the beginning of the season and although that improvement has slowed down since
Christmas, the team is playing a step above. If the team can add some aggressive defense to an improved offense,
the next week may prove to be very exciting.
