concert band closes its season with an informal concert to be held on the lawn south of the David Ovens

DEBNAM’S BOOK TOPS SOUTHERNERS READ IN COLLEGE LIBRARY

The most widely read book in the College Library this year was Debnam’s “Then My Night.” Statistics for the year’s
circulation have just been compiled and of the voluntary reading the North Carolinian’s little booklet on the race question heads
the list for Davidson’s student and faculty reading. This is perhaps surprising in view of the large number of copies
known to be personally owned which provides a sort of competition with library circulation. The second title on the list
is also short and readable: Armour’s “It All Started With Europa.” Previous “best-circulators” have included such lengthy publications as the
Kinsey reports, Waltari’s “The Egyptian” and Gunther’s “Inside U.S.A.” Armour's slight offering is a “spoof” at history and appears to
be particularly popular with the Faculty.

DOZEN FAVORITES

In the order of local popularity, the dozen favorites for the current year are as follows:
Debnam: “Then My Home, Good Night!”
Armour: “It All Started With Europa.”
Klaas: “Maybe I'm Dead.”
Heman: “No Time For Sergeants.”
Wouk: “Caine Mutiny Court Martial.”
Hachiya: “Hiroshima Diary.”
Kantor: “Andersonville.”
Patton: “A Piece Of Luck.”
Wouk: “Marjorie Morningstar.”
Street: “James Street's South.”
