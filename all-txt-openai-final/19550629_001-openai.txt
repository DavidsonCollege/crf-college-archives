THE LITTLE DAVIDSONIAN
(all the news, more or less!)

Volume Number

STARS IN OUR CROWN--
by Louella O. Linker

Davidsonians returning from a big
4th of July weekend need not become de-
pressed, disillusioned, distilled or
otherwise disenchanted, for they will
hardly have time to rest up from their
excesses and peel before they will have
another weekend of play.

THE SOCIAL ACTIVITY OF A DAVIDSON
S. S., SUMMER FROLICS, WILL TAKE PLACE
ON THE UNION TERRACE, MORE OR LESS.

THE DANCE ITSELF WILL BE ON SATURDAY
NIGHT, JULY 9 FROM 8:30 TO 11:30 P.M.

The attire suggested is semi-
formal. The ladies will be respectable
in anything from Christian Dior's
latest creation to a sunback dress.
Gentlemen, Davidson or other varieties,
need not bother with having back straps
on their trousers, for they will have
on a coat (and tie).

MUSIC WILL BE PROVIDED BY A 5-
PIECE COMBO FROM THE BILLY KNAUFF
BAND FROM CHARLOTTE. Believe it
or not, this number is a considerable
increase over last summer's combo, and,
accordingly, the tickets will be $1.50
for the couples and $1.00 for stags.

TICKETS ARE BEING PRINTED AND WILL
GO ON SALE ON TUESDAY, JULY 5.

The atmosphere will be pro-
vided by the nature surrounding the
Union Terrace and the Summer Activities
Committee. The latter promises us inti-
mate little tables with red and white
checkered table cloths. Lighting
effects will come to us via the moon and
candle light.

The Committee will arrange for
light refreshments, and if you and/or
your "femme fatale" wish to indulge in
heavier fare, there will be waiters
available to take your orders and bring
them up from the soda bar. A program
of local talent is also being arranged.

Be sure to get a date for July
9th over this coming weekend. And I'll
tell you next Wednesday in my column who
is taking me to the dance. SEE YOU
THERE!

CINEMA CORNER--
by Four Eyes

If you like movies about a tall, blonde
model who is simultaneously beat, chloro-
formed, and drowned in a bathtub, then
you will love NAKED CITY, which will be
showing at the neighborhood Union AGAIN
TONIGHT AT 10:00 P.M. AFTER THE BREAK.

Since the movie is free you cannot
complain that you only get to see the
aftermath of the model's worldly life
(i.e.: a companion's silk pajamas which
were callously left behind in her Park
Avenue apartment).

Nevertheless, NAKED CITY is a
realistic picture of various social
strata and the leveling influence of
sex and crime thereupon. It is some-
what of a commentary on the ways and
means of the big city.

Barry Fitzgerald is delightful as
usual, and with the exception of Don
Taylor who is the debonair young
detective with an apparently normal home
life, the other characters are stock.
Comic relief is afforded by a middle-
aged schizophrenic who always has a
lead on the latest tabloid murder.

Incidentally, unless you relish
seeing a bird called a roadrunner battle
a rattlesnake, you might elect to miss
the short subject.
