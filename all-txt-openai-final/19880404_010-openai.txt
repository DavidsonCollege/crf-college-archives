**Baseball team loses to UNCC; Stoeckel cites inexperience**

By LARRY DAGENHART

The Davidson baseball team’s record fell to 18-11 after a 17-8 loss to the UNCC 49ers. UNCC pounded the Wildcats
for 20 hits and three home runs while Davidson amassed 11 hits and two homers. Highlights included a three-run shot
in the sixth inning by Ralph Isernia, scoring Ron Krarcik and George Halter, and a solo homer in the ninth
by Roy Vilardi, his fifth on the year.

Coach Jim Stoeckel said that getting behind early and using some players that haven’t had as much experience as others
contributed to the loss. “The only way for the guys (pitchers) to get experience is just to come out and
throw,” he said. Coach Stoeckel also commented that UNCC is a lot better than their 11-14 record shows and that
they hit the ball more consistently than most of the other teams they have played. “I wish we could have
made a better showing, but that’s baseball—we’ll have a game like this and tomorrow will be a different day.”

A pair of those days occurred over the weekend, as Davidson set itself in the midst of the conference race
with a series victory over Furman University. The teams split a doubleheader on Saturday, Furman taking a 9-2 decision and
Davidson rebounded with an 8-5 victory. On Sunday, the Cats took the series with a 6-2 victory. Outstanding for the
Cats were Captain Rob Zimmerman, who went four for nine for the series and collected two home runs, and sophomore
Greg Wilcox, who pitched well on Sunday for the victory. The win on Sunday put Davidson at 3-3 on the
conference season.

The Cats face league-leading Western Carolina in a three-game set this weekend, with a doubleheader on Friday and a single
game on Saturday, all at 1:00.

**NOTES:** Davidson continues to have four hitters above .350 with Mike Holland (.351), Peter Hughes (.371), Roy Vilardi (.376), and
Chris Stuart (.400). If Davidson wins 26 games this season, it will break the season record of wins for any
Davidson baseball team.

**Women’s tennis beats UNCC, loses to Hope College**

The Davidson women’s tennis team went 2-2 last week to bring its record to 11-8. The team was hurt by
the injury to number one player Amy McNelis who is still out indefinitely. However, in spite of her absence, the
team still performed fairly well.

The Lady Cats’ biggest victory came against UNCC. The team avenged last year’s 5-4 loss with a commanding 7-2 win.
Virginia Hall moved from her usual number three spot to the number one slot to replace McNelis. She started the
team with a straight victory over her opponent. Also winning their singles matches were Mary Beth Ruth, Marion Stone, Jane
Price, Alice Stubbs, and Angela Rudert. Stone had returned and had practiced only a little since returning. Coach Brown juggled
the doubles line-up and the new number three team of Rudert-Ruth won their match.

The Lady Cats were not able to keep their momentum going against Hope College. In the past, the team has
had little trouble with Hope, but this year they lost 7-2. The team was not at full strength since McNelis
was injured, the number four player Price did not play, and the number six Debbie DeCou was seeing her first
college action. The winners were Stubbs in singles and the team of Rudert-Ruth in doubles.

The team bounced back from this loss to defeat Ohio University in a tight match. The teams split the singles
matches with Ruth, Stubbs, and Rudert winning their matches. Coach Brown’s new doubles line-up paid off as the Lady Cats
won two of the three matches. The Stone-Stubbs team joined the undefeated Ruth-Rudert team.to bring the team from a come-from-behind
victory. This was the team’s first 5-4 win of the season. On Tuesday, March 29, the Lady Cats traveled to
Furman to battle the defending conference champion Paladins. Although the team lost 7-2, the score is deceiving. Because of conference
rules, the team could not move Hall to the number one slot since she is scheduled to play number three
at the conference tournament. Thus, number seven player Stubbs was forced to play number one singles where she almost upset
Furman’s number one player. Davidson also lost two other close matches. On the winning side, Ruth and Price upset their
opponents. In doubles, though, the Paladins proved to be the better team by sweeping all three matches. The team’s solid
performance in the singles at less than full strength gives Coach Brown optimism about the team’s chance to still win
the tournament. Overall, when McNelis returns, the lineup should be set for the rest of the season. Hopefully, having a
set squad will help the doubles teams learn to play together and give the team a decent chance to win
the conference tournament.

Women’s track 9th at Emory
By BILL SMITH

The track team competed in the Emory Small College Invitational on Saturday, March 26, and returned with pleasing performances. In
the men’s division, Davidson accumulated eleven points to finish thirteenth in a field of nineteen teams; in the women’s division,
Davidson amassed twenty-one points and placed ninth out of sixteen teams. Coach Andrew was happy with the outcome from such
a large invitational and a fine Emory track.

Davidson’s men were strongest in the 10,000-meter run where three runners finished in the top seven slots. Jay Clugston was
the lead runner, placing fourth with a time of 33:23; Chris Fisher ran behind Clugston to finish fifth with a
33:38; and Steve Childs picked up seventh running a 34:54. Bob Cornish collected points in the steeplechase event by running
10:32 to come in fourth place. Unfortunately, Doug Saintsing returned injured from a freak accident involving his leg and the
distance markers in the infield. He still participated and threw the javelin 137 feet, 5 inches to win seventh, but
he could be out for the season. Also, Jeff Williamson didn’t make the trip south due to an injury. The
four-by-400 meter men’s relay team ran their best time this season as they combined to run a 3:32.5. John Lantis
opened with 52.3, Larry Ray ran the second leg in 53.7, David Maynard followed with a 52.6, and David Petranick
finished in a 54.1.

For the women’s team, the point-finishers were Missy Willis, Katie Reynolds, Lisa Culbertson, Chelley Alexander, and Kathy MacDonald. Missy Willis
finished fourth in the 1500-meter run by running a time of 5:04—she unfortunately is hurt slightly now and didn’t run
in the 800-meter. Katie Reynolds worked through a few cramps and placed third in the 10,000-meter with a 42:25 time.
Following Reynolds was Lisa Culbertson in a time of 44:49, good for sixth place. Coach Andrew was pleased with all
three girls in the 10,000 (Vanessa Barton ran just behind Culbertson). Chelley Alexander ran lead for Davidson in the 800-meter
and finished fourth with a time of 2:36. Kathy MacDonald cleared four feet, ten inches in the high jump to
place third—she also is hurt slightly now with shin splints and could not jump at her potential. The Davidson Relays
are next on April first and second, followed by the North Carolina Collegiate State Championships in Chapel Hill on the
ninth. Coach Andrew indicated that the team will rest a little in preparation for the Davidson Relays.
