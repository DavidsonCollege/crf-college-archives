**85 Davidson students fight illiteracy as CIS tutors**

By KIM MUNSTERMAN

A time to learn, a time to laugh, a time to talk, and a time to be encouraged—this describes a Cities in Schools (CIS) tutoring session as experienced by members of the SAE fraternity last year. Because of SAE’s success with the program, eighty-five Davidson students have become reading tutors for these students, committing themselves to an hour each week in tutoring sessions. A student must undergo six hours of training in order to become a tutor. The tutors meet with their 7th through 9th graders at schools.

Menjoying the program because it allows me a one-on-one relationship with my learner and an opportunity for friendship. So far, I don’t feel like I’m a teacher; I’m learning just as much as my student. —Hilary Coman, ‘92

Davidson College has officially associated itself with the CIS program. CIS is a nationwide program concerned with identifying students at risk of dropping out and providing support and social services to keep them in school. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg agency works with students in five junior high schools and high schools, bringing community social workers into the school in order to socially and academically aid those at risk.

Cynthia Marshall, executive director of CIS, stresses the importance of role models for students. “These children have tremendous potential, but are having trouble in the school environment for one reason or another. A student tutor can help the children see a connection between schoolwork and what’s out there for them in the future.”

Many learners, besides having lower-than-average reading scores, come from impoverished or broken homes. The extra attention provided by the tutor may be needed both by the child and by the CIS agency to further determine the child’s needs. Last year an SAE volunteer discovered a serious visual handicap of his learner and was then able to call the school’s attention to the problem. Such extra care can often mean the difference between failing and succeeding for at-risk students.

Not only are the tutoring sessions a time for reading, they are also a time to discuss problems and build friendships. As Caroline Craig, Davidson’s service coordinator points out, Davidson tutors provide more than specialized academic attention. “Because of the tutor-learner relationship and discussions that ensue, the Davidson student makes connections with social problems such as literacy, poverty, housing, and drugs. It is necessary to realize that these can’t be solved as isolated issues.”

This year’s new tutors seem enthusiastic about their work. Says sophomore Hilary Coman, “I’m enjoying the program because it allows me a one-on-one relationship with my learner and an opportunity for friendship. So far, I don’t feel like I’m a teacher; I’m learning just as much as my student.” Sophomore Michelle Carswell adds, “My learner and I have already developed an open relationship. I feel that there is a great potential for Davidson tutors to positively influence less fortunate students in our area.”

What success has this program seen? According to Marshall, of the students in CIS with tutors or mentors, 95 percent were promoted to the next grade level. “Our goal is to provide a comprehensive approach to the students and their surroundings,” she says. “We haven’t reached that yet, but we’re working toward it.”

Craig too is optimistic for the program’s success at Davidson: “Because Davidson students have shown a long-term interest in tutoring and mentoring, I expect that this program can be very successful and well-sustained.”

Junior SAE John Raines recalled last year, saying, “It all really came together in the end. Almost all our kids passed so we took them out to a ballpark and played softball with them. It was definitely a memorable experience seeing all those kids having a blast and celebrating what they’d achieved.”

**Early birds learn taiji at Davidson**

By VIRGINIA MISCHEN

On many a frosty morning, when the sun is barely out of bed, one may spy a small group of strong-hearted souls trudging their way to the basketball court by the track. Their purpose? To learn taiji, a Chinese exercise regimen with a 300-year-old history. According to Professor Wenguang Jian, who teaches the class, the discipline started as a kind of boxing used for defense or attack. “Now,” he says, “it is a way of keeping fit.”Routine consists of a series of flowing, graceful movements, all done with the knees bent and the back straight. There is constant circular motion of the hands and arms and a constant shift of body weight from one leg to the other. This continuous shifting is one manifestation in taiji of the Taoist philosophy of the yin and the yang, states Jian. The philosophy, which works on oppositions, is also present in the contradiction between external movement and internal force. “Outwardly, the movement is smooth and soft,” Jian comments. “But inwardly, there is strength.”

The intense concentration required for taiji helps one to meditate through movement. “It is no good to think of something else or look around,” Jian elaborates. “You must concentrate your attention—you must always look at your fingers.”

What motivates people to take up taiji? As Jian points out, it is good exercise. After a workout, he is “wet with sweat,” he claims with a smile. He has been doing taiji almost every day for 14 years, and he feels that it has improved his health. Before learning taiji, he had trouble falling asleep at night, and he had stomachaches. Now he falls asleep very quickly, and his stomach problem has almost disappeared.

Freshman Craig Bohart, one of three students who attends the class every day (there were originally 14), cites a different reason for doing taiji. He feels that it has aided him in “getting in touch with my body” and “focusing.” He stated, “My coordination and balance have improved.” His enthusiasm for taiji is so great that he hopes to make it a lifetime pursuit.

Both Bohart and Jian recommend taiji for those with the will to invest time and practice, not just to learn the movements, but also to refine them according to the requirements of the discipline. If you are interested in attending a class, it meets Monday through Thursday at 7 a.m. This semester Jian teaches the course for P.E. credit; he may offer the class next semester as well. So come, watch, move, get in touch with yourself. As Bohart remarks, “It’s a good way to get the day going.”

The following is an interview conducted with hall counselors Mark Puckett (3rd Little) and Dave Williams (4th Little).

The Davidsonian: Why did you want to become a hall counselor?
Puckett: I wanted to do it for the money—
Williams: (laughing) Huh!
Puckett: —you make about $150 a term. No, this is what I basically said in my interview: I wanted to be in the swing of things and meet the new freshmen. I talked to my hall counselor and he said if he hadn’t been a hall counselor he would have been out of it, gotten an apartment, and floated off into menial nothingness.
Williams: I did it because I thought I'd be good at it. Help out with the transition to college—
Puckett: Yeah, me too.
Williams: —because I had a really difficult time as a freshman and I found out what things you need to do to solidify yourself.

The Davidsonian: Did you have a good idea of how you would react to certain situations?
Puckett: You have to take the “learn as you go approach” because you never know what will happen. I mean, you may get a hall where no one gets along, just like Mark said.
Williams: Like Mark said, you may get a hall that’s perfect, loud, arrogant, jerks. If I do have to study in my room, I can make it known. Most of the time, I don’t mind it. I can’t study in the lounge, but I’m in there most of the time.
Puckett: Amazing! This is like another question just like the interview for hall counselor.
Williams: The question was how you react to certain situations.
Puckett: You really have to keep an open mind.
Williams: Take it each day as it comes.
