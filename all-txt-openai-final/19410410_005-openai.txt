Between classes... pause and refresh

A good way to get the most out of anything is to pause now and then and refresh yourself... with
ice-cold Coca-Cola. Its taste is delicious. Its after-sense of refreshment is delightful. A short pause for ice-cold Coca-Cola is the
refreshing thing to do. So when you pause throughout the day, make it the pause that refreshes with ice-cold Coca-Cola.
