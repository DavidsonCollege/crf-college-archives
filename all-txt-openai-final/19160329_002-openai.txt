OUR AIMS.
There is but one way to achieve success, and that is to strive toward a high ideal. This is true
in the case of newspapers as well as other things. The Davidsonian is about to celebrate its third birthday. It
has passed into the hands of a new staff, to be surrounded by new thought and ideas. And though the
new staff may be unable to fill the shoes of the old staff, it has the same high ideals for
the paper.

The Davidsonian is meant primarily to represent the Student Body as a whole in thought and action. It is a
paper for the students and by the students. Its sincere endeavor is to be governed by neither fear nor love
nor any organization or party. As far as possible everything that enters its pages is authoritative. Signed papers by anyone
are not only welcomed but courted. Criticisms and suggestions are of great use to the editors.

Then The Davidsonian is intended to be a thing of real service to the alumni, to give to them a
true picture of all departments of college life and to keep them in touch with each other. Davidson's rapid development
during the last few years has been due largely to the alumni, and if the paper could be a means
of binding the association together, a means of communication, it would not be purposeless.

The Davidsonian has ideals of growth: growth in quality, each year finding it better organized and more readable; growth in
lines of thought and breadth of topics; growth in size, fondly looking forward to the time when a six or
eight-page issue will greet its readers; growth in circulation, a copy in the hands of every student and alumnus and
friend of the college.

So this is what the editors of The Davidsonian are working toward. They will need support.

WEEKLY MEETINGS.
The regular debate of the Eumenean Society last week was unusually good. All the speakers showed that they had spent
a great deal of time and thought, and expressed themselves in strong, effective words. The subject, "Resolved, that the Keating
Child Labor Bill should be passed," was defeated. The affirmative was upheld by J. T. Williams, Allen and Bellingrath, whose
chief arguments were based on thefact that such a law was needed by the working children, and that only a
national law would be properly enforced. On the negative, J. H. Miller, Hoyt, and Mullen dwelt on the fact that
it was unconstitutional, and that it was a direct blow at the industries of the South. The strongest speech of
the evening was delivered by L. A. Mullen, of the negative, who answered a great part of his opponents’ arguments.
G. C. Bellingrath, of the affirmative, gave a very good debate. The regular meetings of the societies Monday morning were
not held on account of the student body meeting directly after breakfast. The debate in the Phi was probably the
best of the year. Every man showed that he had given more time to preparation than usual. The rejoinders were
spirited and showed that each man was getting at the heart of the question. Those debating on the affirmative side
were: J. L. Fowle, Reese, H. B. Craig, and Clary. Some of the arguments offered by them were that child
labor was having a ruinous effect, that Congress had a right to better the conditions from the “welfare” clause of
the constitution. The negative side was composed of C. Hunter, Nesbit, F. N. Morton, Witt, and Sparrow. They recognized the
need of caring for the children but showed that the bill was an improvement over our own North Carolina law
only in making the age limit thirteen instead of fourteen. Then several decisions of the Supreme Court were read to
show that the bill was unconstitutional. The decision rendered by the judges was in favor of the negative. Fowle probably
brought the most forceful argument for the affirmative, and Witt and Sparrow for the negative.

“MOVIES” SATURDAY NIGHT. The “Movies” in Shearer Hall, Saturday night, were attended by a very large and attentive audience of
both students and people of the town. The pictures were given under the auspices of the Civic League. D. W.
Lane and L. A. Crawford operated the machine. Because of insurance regulations it is impossible to have pictures regularly in
Shearer Hall. It is reported, however, that there are to be one or two more “movie” attractions this spring.
