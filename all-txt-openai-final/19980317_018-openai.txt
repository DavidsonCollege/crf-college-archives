GREENSBORO — After helping the women’s basketball team to its winningest season ever, Jen O’Brien, Jessica Montrella, and Kerry Brown were all named to the All-Southern Conference team as selected by the league’s coaches and sports information directors. O’Brien made the first team, while Montrella and Brown were both second-teamers. Although edged out by Furman’s Jackie Smith for conference player of the year honors, O’Brien was a unanimous selection for the first team.

The Wildcat point guard had arguably the finest individual season in the history of Davidson women’s basketball, finishing atop the Southern Conference in assists (6.8 per game), steals (3.2), and also three-point percentage (44.8). Her numbers at the end of the regular season placed her 11th in the nation in assists and 17th in accuracy from three. Montrella, a 6-foot-2 forward, stood second in the league in free throw shooting, fifth in blocks, and 13th in scoring with a 12.0 average. Brown finished third in free throw shooting, seventh in assists, ninth in blocks, and 11th in steals.

GREENSBORO — Sure beats Statesboro. The women’s basketball team exorcised lingering demons from last year’s Southern Conference tournament loss at Georgia Southern by beating Appalachian St. 79-63 in this year’s tourney opener Feb. 27 at Fleming Gym on the campus of UNC Greensboro. A change in tournament format eliminated home games for the top four seeds, shifting all four quarterfinals to the relatively neutral court at Fleming.

With the victory, the Wildcats improved to 18-8, upping what was already a program-record number of wins, and earned a date in the semifinals with hometown favorite UNCG. “We gave a fantastic effort tonight,” coach John Filar said. “We came out on fire and didn’t stop shooting all game.” Davidson, which led throughout, shot 47.3 percent from the floor, including a phenomenal 11-for-18 performance from three-point land. The Wildcat defense was as spectacular, limiting the rival Mountaineers to only 31.9 percent proficiency. Appalachian star Beth Schoolfield, the league’s fourth-leading scorer, went 3-for-15 and managed just six points.

In scoring a game-high 25 points, Davidson standout Jen O’Brien broke school records for points and three-pointers in a season. The point guard from Mercy, Conn., only a sophomore, also became the program’s ninth all-time leading scorer. Jennie Vanlerberghe tallied 12 points for the Wildcats, while Jennifer Sanborn came off the bench to notch 10. Katy Kamp led the squad with eight rebounds. “Our lack of execution and their excellent execution in the first half caused a deficit we couldn’t overcome,” Appalachian coach Barbie Breedlove said.

The victory, though, was bittersweet for Davidson, as junior Kerry Brown suffered a deep back bruise early in the second half. She was carried off the floor and did not play in Saturday’s semifinal.

UNCG ends Wildcats’ tourney run

GREENSBORO — All things considered, the effort was truly phenomenal. Playing without all-conference performers Jamie Brown or Kerry Brown — Jamie sat out the last two months of the season with a stress fracture in her hip and Kerry went down with a back injury in the conference quarterfinal against Appalachian — the women’s basketball team came within a whisker of knocking off eventual tourney champion UNC Greensboro in the league semifinals Feb. 28 at the Greensboro Coliseum. Jen O’Brien’s game-tying three-point attempt at the buzzer fell just short, as the Spartans advanced to the title contest and ended a record-breaking campaign for the Wildcats.

“Sometimes it goes in and sometimes it doesn’t,” coach John Filar said after the heartbreaking loss. “But one shot does not make the game.” The contest was nip and tuck throughout, featuring five ties. UNCG’s biggest lead was eight — 18-10 on a Melinda Goodson layup nine minutes into the first half. Davidson's largest bulge was two, achieved twice midway through the second. After trailing by eight early, the Wildcats gradually chipped away at the Spartan advantage, tying the score at 20 on a three by O’Brien just under nine minutes before intermission. “I thought in the first half we gave an unbelievable effort,” Filar said. “I was very pleased at halftime.”

Clinging to a 68-67 lead with 5:34 to go, UNCG manufactured a decisive 6-0 spurt from which Davidson never fully recovered. Ultimately, though, the difference proved to be in the paint, as the Spartans outrebounded the Wildcats 49-32 and had a 17-4 advantage on the offensive glass. Said Filar: “They were huge on the boards, and we just could not get inside position.” Goodson paced UNCG with 23 points and 11 rebounds, while all-conference first-teamers Biz Brediger and Rebecca Viverette added 17 and 13 points, respectively. Brediger joined Goodson with a double-double, collecting 11 boards as well.

For the Wildcats, Katy Kamp starred in a 19-point, 8-rebound performance, while O’Brien and Jessica Montrella notched 17 points apiece. Jennifer Sanborn made 5-of-9 shots from the floor, finishing with a season-high 13 points in her final game as a Wildcat. Fellow seniors Danielle Mall and Jennie Vanlerberghe also played their last games in red and black. Mall ended up with four points and Vanlerberghe went scoreless.scoreless in a foul-plagued 20 minutes. “It was an excellent game from beginning to end,” UNCG coach Lynn Agee said. Despite the loss, the Wildcats’ 18 wins on the season represented a program high, marking the third straight year Davidson has accomplished that feat.

Early jitters doom Davidson in NCAAs

ATLANTA — Michigan spent 45 minutes of its hour-long practice session Thursday at the Georgia Dome putting on a jam session for a smattering of fans. The other 15? Halfcourt shots. To say the Wolverines were loose heading into their NCAA tournament first-round matchup with Davidson would be a gross understatement. But so were the Wildcats. Or so they claimed.

“The nerves really haven’t hit at all,” Mark Donnelly said at the pre-tourney press conference. “It’s been easy to stay focused.” Coach Bob McKillop wasn’t buying it. “Our guys tried to give me the impression that they were poised and relaxed,” said the ninth-year coach. Guess not.

In a 10-minute span in front of the entire nation — the game was seen by 81 percent of the country overall, but each and every CBS viewer at the top of the broadcast — Michigan built a 27-9 bulge en route to a relatively comfortable 80-61 victory over Davidson. In the first nine minutes and change, Ali Ton, Stephen Marshall, Chadd Holmes, and Ben Ebong all committed turnovers, while Michigan guard Robbie Reid hit three three-pointers to trigger the early — yet decisive — Wolverine run. Post player Maceo Baston had five points in the spurt, while Robert Traylor — nicknamed “Tractor” due to his almost ridiculous 6-foot-8, 300-pound stature — energized the Maize and Blue contingent with a rim-rattling jam at the 15:01 juncture.

“The early jitters were a response to the hoopla that surrounds this event,” McKillop said bluntly in the postgame press conference. “We showed our inexperience in the NCAAs at the beginning of the game,” added Billy Armstrong, one of few bright spots for the Wildcats, as the senior point guard capped his time at Davidson with a career-high-tying 13 points.

The last 30 minutes of the game were almost a dead heat, but it hardly mattered. The damage had been done. Said McKillop: “We dug ourselves a hole and it became almost impossible for us to dig out of that hole.”

“We had a tough time in the beginning,” explained Davor Halbauer, who shot 4-for-6 from three-point territory and led Davidson with 14 points. “We let them take over pretty easily, and it was pretty tough to catch up with them. This was our first time. I think it was a little bit of an inexperience factor. Michigan’s a great team.” Especially when you spot the Wolverines an 18-point lead.

Depth key to Wildcats success
By Dante Morz & Michael J. Kruse, Senior Staff Writers

GREENSBORO — How fitting. During, and even before the preseason, coach Bob McKillop said one of his biggest challenges this season would be to find a consistent starting lineup. Was the problem that there were not five players who could sufficiently fill that role? No. The problem: There were nine.

Throughout this season, one of the Wildcats’ biggest weapons has been their depth. In their march to the Southern Conference title, that strength proved lethal. Like their entire season, the Wildcats’ conference championship was truly a team effort. In each of Davidson’s tournament victories, a Wildcat either established or matched his career high in scoring — Ali Ton (20 points against Georgia Southern), Stephen Marshall (27 versus The Citadel), and Ben Ebong (17 in the final against Appalachian).

While Ebong, the conference’s premier sixth man and the tournament’s most outstanding performer, was the most obvious hero in the conference championship victory with his 17 points, nine rebounds, and game-saving steal, Davidson wouldn’t be champion without contributions from others off the bench. Gunslinger David Burns, after sitting out his only game of the season the day before in the semifinal victory over The Citadel, lived up to his “Instant Offense” moniker, registering nine points on three treys in just five minutes. It was his biggest output since the first Western Carolina game Jan. 2 in Cullowhee.

“David just did his thing,” fellow sub and former roommate Chadd Holmes said. Billy Armstrong, playing point guard in place of the injured Ali Ton for much of the second half, had his best performance of the season. He notched 10 points — only the second time this year he reached double figures — and added four assists. He also iced the title victory with three free throws in the final minute.

After losing to Appalachian in the semifinals, Chattanooga coach Henry Dickerson said the bench would be one of the factors in the final. How right he was. Ebong, Burns, and Armstrong outscored the Mountaineers’ bench 36-2.

“Our bench does it in so many ways,” said McKillop in the postgame press conference. “David proved that he is a prolific scorer and that he has the ability to hit the three-pointer at any time. And to see Billy come in at point guard for an injured Ali Ton and perform at such a high level was extremely gratifying.”

“Bill was huge,” said Landry Kosmalski when asked about the bench production. “And David was unbelievable.” But what about Ebong? “Ben is hardly a bench player,” Kosmalski explained with a smile. “He’s like a sixth starter.” After falling to Ebong and the Wildcats thrice this season, the Mountaineers would certainly agree.
