Rugby Ends Fall With Win Over Duke, Loss To St. Andrews

By Tim Harris

The Davidson rugby team ended its fall season Saturday with a tough, 16-6 loss to St. Andrew’s. The fall slate began with a series of challenging matches against Appalachian State, Johnson City, and Wake Forest, but ended with a surge of momentum.

The team put on a fine show of rugby Parents’ Weekend in a 3-3 tie with Western Carolina, and followed it up with a comeback upset of Duke. Trailing 11-0 at the half, they stormed back in the second half to shut out the Blue Devils and win 16-11. Wyatt Lilly and Mike Cruise each recorded a try (score), and Jamie Brown kicked two goals.

Considering that more than half the team is comprised of newcomers, the team showed remarkable improvement. Returning players made up the core of the team, but freshmen filled in at a variety of positions. The new players developed quickly, and their continued interest should lead the team into a strong, competitive spring season.

...should be a lasting varsity program. But a thrown-together club team cannot expect to play Division I basketball, and Davidson will not attempt it. This year’s schedule includes home and home series with Spartanburg Methodist, Brevard, Meredith, Barton, and Warren Wilson, and single visits to Eastern Mennonite and North Greenville. The home season begins with a scrimmage against Catawba this Tuesday.
