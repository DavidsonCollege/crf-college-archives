OUR COACHES.
A great part of the success of this year’s football season was due to the efficient coaching of Fetzer and Kluttz. With raw material and “what the Lord, and nobody else, sent them,” they succeeded in producing one of the best teams Davidson has had in years. Both are old Davidson men and made their letter in both football and baseball while in college. They have the old Davidson “pep” and know how to instill into their men the fight that has always characterized Davidson’s teams. To them belongs a large part of the season’s success and as a result of their labors Davidson had this year one of the best-coached teams in the South.

EDITORIAL.
COLLEGE SPIRIT.
College spirit means something finer than lawlessness, dissipation, and rowdyism. It means the loyalty to an institution which makes a student guard its good name by being manly and courteous in conduct at all times and in all places. It means the sense of responsibility which aids a student in forming habits of temperance and industry. It means that eagerness to make a grateful use of his opportunities which leads a student to keep his own body fit, through moderate athletics and a physical training that knows no season, is never broken. College spirit means this and far more. It means that loyalty to a college which rivets a man to the severest tasks of scholarship, through which he gains intellectual power and enthusiasm, without which no graduate is an entire credit to any college. And finally, it means that vision of an ideal life beyond commencement which shows a man that only through the rigid subordination of transient and trivial pleasures can he hope to become the only great victory a college ever wins—a trained, devoted, and inspired alumnus, working for the welfare of mankind.—William Trufant Foster, President Reed College.

ANNOUNCEMENT.
This issue of The Davidsonian will be the last before the Christmas Holidays. It would be highly appreciated by all the Staff if the members of the Faculty could see their way clear to excuse them from examinations, in order that the paper might be issued, but it seems that the spirit has not moved them in that way. During the Spring, there are some new plans for the paper which will make a larger and a better publication, and the continued co-operation of the students is wanted.

Cards have been received on the campus announcing the marriage of R. Pair (ex-’16) to Miss Willie Lee Latham, of Richmond, Va., on October 29.

OBITUARY.
Col. R. W. Wharton, of the class of 1849, died a few days ago at the home of his son-in-law, Congressman J. H. Small, of Washington, N. C., aged 88 years. He was in most of the important battles of the Civil War, being made Lieutenant-Colonel in 1864.

Mrs. C. M. Richards entertained the Mission Study Classes of the Presbyterian Church on Monday evening. A discussion of the book studied this Fall, Home Missions in Action, was followed by a social hour and refreshments.
