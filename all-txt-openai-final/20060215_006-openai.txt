#### Little-known Oscar hopefuls show exceptional character
By STEVE KALISKI

“Munich” bears the blessing of Steven Spielberg’s name. “Crash” created a provocative splash over the summer by imposing the race question upon mainstream audiences. And so many people have an opinion about the cowboy movie that Bill Gates is considering adding “brokeback” as Microsoft Word’s thesaurus’ newest synonym for homosexual. As three of the five films nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, “Munich,” “Crash,” and “Brokeback Mountain” all garnered attention in wildly public ways. While they certainly deserve this attention, audiences should not ignore the other two nominees, especially since their recent praise has thrust them back into wide release.

“Good Night, and Good Luck” and “Capote,” two character studies that deal with two very different controversies from the 1950s, each construct sensitive, understated stories around masterful performances.

“Good Night, and Good Luck,” a crisply engaging newsroom drama that evokes the tics and journalism as pointedly as “All the President’s Men,” locks David Strathairn into the role of his career as the courageous CBS broadcaster Edward Murrow. During the months when McCarthyism essentially terrorized the mass media into keeping its mouth shut, Murrow unleashed a chain of daring stories that reinvigorated his industry’s bravery. Efficiently directed by George Clooney without the slightest sense of decadence, “Good Night” is like an offense that runs two or three plays so successfully that it needs not deepen its playbook. Clooney does not bite off more than he can chew; he restricts the action to the CBS newsroom and to actual footage from the McCarthy hearings. At times, the film is so grounded in cold, hard facts that it feels like a documentary. Clooney also allows the style of the film to reflect the personality of the reserved, yet passionate Murrow. Some of the most haunting moments occur in the pensive, tortured silences that follow Murrow’s gutsy broadcasts. In one, Clooney fixes a tight shot on Strathairn and allows the actor’s thoughtful face to do the rest of the work.

Similarly, director Bennett Miller wisely confines his unsettling “Capote” to the uncanny work of his star, Philip Seymour Hoffman. The normally gruff actor so thoroughly nails the dainty, endearing eccentricities of the flamboyant author that, were I to see real footage of Truman Capote sometime soon, I might complain of him simply not behaving correctly. When the film meditates on the fascinating psychology of Capote, Hoffman makes it soar. Unfortunately, because this historical snapshot focuses primarily on the unlikely friendship between Capote and Perry Smith, one of the soon-to-be-executed killers who inspired the true crime novel “In Cold Blood,” the narrative occasionally falters. Hoffman performs on such a higher plane than his co-star Clifton Collins, Jr. that their relationship never develops convincing chemistry. We watch in awe as Capote unravels from the cloudy divide between real life and literature, but Smith never seems worth the worry. Nonetheless, the gut-wrenching finale earns the film the status of indie powerhouse.

Though less so than “Good Night, and Good Luck,” “Capote” still rounds out one of the strongest line-ups of Best Picture nominees in years. Although I strongly believe that the shattering “Munich” deserves top honors, experts seem confident that “Brokeback” will triumph over, or because of, its controversiality. Regardless of the first place winner, let us hope that “Good Night, and Good Luck” and “Capote” win the most important prize: enthusiastic audiences.

#### Davidson Outdoors promotes trips for peace of mind

For some students, “getting away from it all” means more than stepping off campus to grab a bite at Bonsai. Davidson Outdoors (D.O.) offers many opportunities to relieve the burden of books and exams, giving students the chance to kayak, hike,mountain bike, fly fish, and even “spelunk,” or cave dive. The current board members hope to encourage more students to sign up for trips this semester. The board, which was elected last November and includes President Justin Plummer ’08, Vice President Drew Patterson ’08, and nine other members, distributed brochures earlier this year in an attempt to pique interest. “We’ve had a problem in the past with certain trips, like one of the backpacking trips that took three people when it easily could have gone with six or more,” said Plummer. The group has also been working to include a much broader variety of expeditions, such as rock climbing and whitewater kayaking, which it has planned for this spring. 

Board member Elizabeth Henry ’08 said that “the board also plans to conduct a student survey later this semester to determine what kinds of trips are the favorites of the student body, and what trips they’d like to see.” Trip participation has been high so far this year, and one trip set for April is already booked. Board member Susan Bean ’06 added that “advertising for trips by word of mouth” is an effective way to get out the word on D.O. Like the other board members, Bean is also a D.O. student trip leader and plans to lead a beginner kayaking trip over Easter Break. Though she said that “being on the board is nothing but joy,” she added that “planning meals, itineraries, and organizing gear for a weekend trip for eight or so people can be a tough job.” Bean, however, feels that the work is worth it. “Over the years, I’ve learned that in the woods, people make their own fun, and I cherish watching that happen for new groups of people,” she said. 

Founded by alumni and current director Ed Daugherty as a small, Union Board-affiliated organization that existed mainly to lead incoming students on a three-day orientation trip, D.O. now boasts its own vehicles and an office that occupies the Union’s base floor. The organization also has rooms full of camping supplies, which include everything from tents to cliff-repelling gear, and continues its tradition of orientation trips with the weeklong Odyssey adventure. Students interested in taking a trip can explore their options on the D.O. webpage, which details each trip and lists any spots available. Trip signups are done in the organization’s office. Some past excursions this semester included a skiing trip to Snowshoe, WV, as well as a caving trip to Pig Hole and Tawneys in Christiansburg, VA. In addition to many future weekend getaways, D.O. is offering students the chance to canoe in the Everglades over Spring Break. The recent winter trip to the same destination filled up quickly and has proven to be a popular mainstay on the organization’s trip list. The board members all encourage students to try a D.O. trip while at Davidson. “It affords a healthy perspective on life that this campus,” said Bean, “and seeing the green of the woods rather than the green of the library carpet can do wonders for the soul.”
