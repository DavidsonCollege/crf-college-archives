**Beyond Davidson**

Headlining the news for the week of September 26 - October 2:

**Internationally** — South Africa’s President P.W. Botha announced plans to grant universal suffrage to all blacks and bring them into
the decision-making process “at the highest level”; however, Botha rejected the notion of one-man, one-vote for the country’s black majority.
In a decision applauded by civil rights groups, a court in South Africa issued a ruling prohibiting police from beating
detainees being held under the current state of emergency. Earlier in the week, in an overt effort to push Botha
toward abolishing apartheid, 91 South African businessmen and representatives of foreign companies signed their names to newspaper advertisements stating, “There
is a better way.” In the U.S., President Reagan signed an order banning the importation of Krugerrand gold coins; the
measure came as a follow-up to the limited economic sanctions imposed in early September.

The U.S.S.R announced the retirement of Premier Nikolai Tikhonov (80); Nikolai Ryzhkov (56), a close ally of Communist Party leader
Gorbachev, has been named his successor in what is viewed as a further consolidation of Gorbachev’s power. The U.S.S.R and
Oman announced plans to establish diplomatic ties. Meanwhile, in apparent protest of the U.S.S.R.’s support of Syria, two separate groups
of gunmen in Moslem-controlled West Beirut, Lebanon kidnapped three Soviet diplomats and one Soviet Embassy doctor; one diplomat has been
killed, and both groups are threatening to execute the other three.

**The headlines: Apartheid, Russia**

In other Middle East developments — much to the displeasure of Israel, the U.S. announced plans to sell arms to
Jordan. Reagan met with Jordan’s King Hussein on Monday in continued efforts to establish a framework for Middle East peace
talks. Hussein wants the U.S.S.R. involved and Reagan does not; no compromise has yet been reached. Israel bombed PLO leader
Yasir Arafat's headquarters in Tunisia in retaliation to the slaying of three Israelis in Cyprus last week for which a
PLO group claimed responsibility; Arafat denies involvement.

**Elsewhere** — In Panama, Ardito Barletta resigned as president and was replaced by his first vice president Devalle, a moderate
conservative; the U.S. issued a statement in regret of Barletta’s resignation. In the Punjab, Sikh moderate Sujit Singh Barnala was
unanimously elected as the state’s chief minister. Barnala is a moderate who supports Indian Prime Minister Gandhi's Punjab peace accord;
Sikh militants are protesting the new government.

**Domestically** — Fiscal year 1986 began Tuesday; among its many consequences came a 19 percent tax increase on hard liquor.
In the largest non-oil acquisition in corporate history, Philip Morris Comp. Inc. bought General Foods Corp. for $5.63 billion to
form the nation’s largest consumer products company. In other news — A high-ranking Soviet KGB member defected to the U.S.;
the CIA claims this to be one of the biggest spy coups in history. Margaret Heckler, Secretary of Health and
Human Services, will leave her Cabinet post to become Ambassador to Ireland. Finally, after a long battle with AIDS, Rock
Hudson died in his sleep on Wednesday morning.

**Thought for the week:** “Give others what you want yourself, and see what it does for them, and indirectly for
you.” — Dr. Walter Kalaf

**Anderson, Savarese join College faculty**

By HEIDI HOOKER and JIM DILLON

Lyle Anderson

Lyle V. Anderson has joined the philosophy department as a visiting assistant professor for this year. Anderson is from Lake
Wobegon, Minn., and graduated from St. Olaf College in Minnesota. Although he majored in philosophy, religion, and art, he was
originally interested in the sciences. He earned his M.Div. at the Divinity School of Yale. He continued studies in Copenhagen
for one year, where he focused on the works of Kierkegaard. He also attended Cornell for one year and Yale
for two years. He received his Ph.D. in philosophy in 1980 after completing a dissertation concerning the relation between motivation
and rationality in Aristotle and his theory of action. Anderson wants to write essays on ethics and metaphysics, in which
he may include a new theory of action.

An active member of the peace movement, Anderson helped found the Abbey Hills National Peace Academy in Ohio. Anderson wrote
the constitution, organized the curriculum, and assembled a scholastic journal for the Academy. The Academy serves as a retreat and
an educational institution for noncredit academics. As for special interests and hobbies, Anderson claims that “basketball is his religion.” He
has been captain of two undefeated intramural teams and plays now with the “noon hour faculty group.” He is unmarried,
loves music, and has two cats. Anderson is very positive about his Davidson experience so far. Valuing his own junior
year at St. Olaf in Oxford, he encourages students to go abroad to widen their perspective beyond the limits of
a small college. This term he teaches Philosophy 103 and 105 and will be teaching Humanities.

**This week's safety tip hits the road: buckle up**

By RAY THROWER

On Tuesday, October 1, 1985, a new North Carolina Law came into effect. The new Seat Belt Law will make
it mandatory for what most people admit they ought to do anyway but don’t: buckle up. The new law states
that everyone over the age of 6 who is riding in the front seat of a motor vehicle must wear
seat belts. Failure to comply will be seen as an infraction.and Social Philosophy in the winter.

John Savarese

After earning a doctorate in English literature from Princeton University and serving as a professor of English at Sweet Briar
College, John Savarese switched fields to become Assistant Director of the Computer Services Center this year.

“Davidson is an exciting place,” Savarese said. “I like the liberal arts background here. That's where I came from. That's
my background. It’s exciting to see computers being used imaginatively without being an engineering or technical school. There's a lot
that the rest of us can do with computers. A lot of people here are computer users, and there is
a lot of growth about to happen.”

Savarese is a member of the Presidential Task Force on the Future of Computing at Davidson, which will examine the
needs and possible uses of computers at Davidson in the near future. “We're off to a really good start, and
this thing could be big time,” Savarese said.

Savarese is married to Terry Scarborough, who was Director of Admissions at Sweet Briar during Savarese’s years as an English
professor there. She is currently temporarily employed by Wachovia Bank while taking courses in hopes of gaining a master’s degree.

Savarese said that a great deal of progress in the field of computers will occur at Davidson within the next
five years. “In the next five years, I see a lot more of what I call ‘personal computing.’ I think
you’ll see the computer actually in the workspace. The computer is becoming a tool that will be at the elbow
of every student and faculty member,” Savarese said.

Thirteen schools in the United States require their students to purchase computers. Davidson is one of a large number of
colleges that encourage, but do not require, the purchase of computers, according to Savarese. “I don't know if Davidson will
ever require the purchase of computers,” he said. “If I knew that I'd be very valuable around here. I think
that will become clearer though as prices come down and people begin to use computers more heavily,” he added.

Savarese became interested in computers while writing his dissertation at Princeton. He has also been on sabbatical at Stanford University
to study computers. “I have a real interest in the way computers are used to understand language and the uses
of language,” Savarese said. “Some call that ‘artificial intelligence.’ While at Stanford, I studied ‘artificial intelligence,’ and I have a
real interest in that.”

Thrower educates, relates

By JEFF LESESNE

Police officer Ray Thrower brings seven years of experience with him as the new Davidson College crime prevention officer. Thrower
has been in charge of programs to orient freshmen toward crime prevention. He also works closely with the RAPE committee.
He said, “my primary concern is making Davidson College as safe as possible.”

Thrower grew up in Davidson, where his grandfather was the police chief. After becoming an officer in 1978 he went
to work for the Mooresville Police Department. He then taught drivers’ education for a while, and then he became a
patrolman for the town of Davidson. In March of 1985, he became an officer for Davidson College.

Thrower graduated from Central Piedmont Community College in 1978 with a two-year associate and applied science degree in Criminal Justice.
He is also a state-certified drivers’ education teacher and a state-certified crime prevention officer. He also has a general law
enforcement certificate. He attended bomb procedure school and various law enforcement update schools. Thrower has recently gone back to school
to earn his B.A. in Criminal Justice. He is presently a senior at Sacred Heart College in Belmont, N.C. He
explained, “I'm a student myself, so I understand the things that are going on around campus. I know all the
problems they [students] have and I understand their environment.”

Thrower is married and has an eleven-month-old girl. When not studying, he enjoys his computer and the outdoors.

Studies show that using seat belts greatly reduces the chance of serious injury. They also show that for every 100
drivers killed not wearing safety belts, about 75 would be alive today if they had worn them. Each year 600
people in North Carolina die because they do not wear their seat belts. Another 5,000 are seriously injured. That is
a tremendous loss of our state's most precious resource — our people.

There are several common complaints against wearing safety belts. A common one is, “I'm afraid that my car will catch
on fire and I won't be able to get out.” Or, “I'm afraid my car will go off into the
water and I will drown.” Cars rarely catch on fire or go under water except on TV. The use of
a safety belt is more likely to keep you conscious so that you can get out. If you do not
wear a safety belt, there is a good chance you will be unconscious and unable to do anything. Some people
say they feel uncomfortable wearing a safety belt, but a wheelchair is even less comfortable.
