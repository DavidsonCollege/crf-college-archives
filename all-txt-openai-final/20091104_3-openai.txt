**The Buddy System, acapella groups to hold charity concert**

Sunday, Nov. 15, Davidson organization The Buddy System will be holding a charity concert, with performances by the Generals, the
Delilahs, and Androgyny, in Duke Family Performance Hall at 5 p.m. to raise money for the Autism Foundation of the
Carolinas and PTA Too, Davidson Elementary’s parent-teacher organization for families of children with special needs. The tickets will be free
for students and the public, though donations are encouraged.

The Buddy System was founded last semester by Billy Powers ’10, who started the club after working for many years
with children with special needs. “I have seen the positive effects that positive social interactions can have on both children
with special needs and their mainstreamed peers,” Powers said. “I’ve also found that working with kids with special needs has
helped me keep things in perspective. Despite all of the challenges they face, the kids I’ve worked with have maintained
wonderful outlooks on life, which is something I really admire.”

The Buddy System members spend one afternoon a week at Davidson Elementary, working with special needs students. “While schools often
do a great job of satisfying the educational needs of children with special needs, their social needs aren’t always met,”
Powers said. “We try to fulfill those needs by facilitating one-on-one and group activities that promote positive social interactions.” In
the past, activities have included sundae making, arts and crafts, and singing. But Powers emphasized a greater goal. “More important
than the activities themselves are the relationships that are formed while we’re there,” he said.

The concert will feature three of Davidson’s acapella groups, with the final piece being a collaboration of the groups and
the special-needs students. It will also feature both a parent and student speaker. Money raised will go toward ensuring the
availability of scholarships that provide after-school activities for children with special needs, who otherwise could not afford them. “This idea
was born out of a desire for the three acapella groups to come together in support of a good cause,”
Powers said. “We hope to raise awareness about the challenges that children with special needs, as well as their families,
face every day.”

To find out more about the concert, or to get involved with The Buddy System, students can contact Powers at

10/28/09 11:20 hrs Assist Fire
Officer was advised that a student had fallen in Watts dorm on the fourth floor. The reporting officer responded and
found Davidson College student.laying on the floor in the hallway on the fourth floor. The student was conscious and alert
but complaining of lower back pain and a headache. She advised she was feeling poorly and had a cold but
did not remember falling. The reporting officer called for Medic to examine. Medic arrived, along with Davidson Fire Dept., and
after examining, transported her to Lake Norman Regional Medical Center.

10/29/09 00:33 hrs Vehicle Stop
Officer observed two people sitting on a toolbox in the back of a truck bed while the truck was traveling
west on Baker Dr. The reporting officer followed the vehicle and observed the two people lying down in the truck
bed attempting to hide. The reporting officer conducted a traffic stop in front of the Davidson Laundry. The passengers were
identified as Davidson College student and alumni. The reporting officer spoke with the three students about the safety of sitting
down in the truck bed while the truck is moving.

10/29/09 17:43 hrs Suspicious Vehicle
Officer observed a suspicious vehicle parked in the southwest corner of the Baker Sports parking lot. The reporting officer observed
a male subject inside a vehicle registered to a rental car company. The reporting officer spoke with the driver, who
advised he was attending an Asian conference in the Chambers Building and was a few hours early. The reporting officer
checked through NCIC/DCI.

10/30/09 16:45 hrs Animal Control
Officer was contacted advising that an injured hawk was found at the outdoor tennis courts. The officer contacted Dispatch and
requested them to call the Raptor Center located in Huntersville, NC. Officials from the Raptor Center came and removed the
hawk to be healed at their facility. No further action was required.

10/31/09 00:12 hrs Fire
Officers were dispatched to a fire alarm at the Kappa Sigma House. Upon arrival, both officers observed significant foam built
up at the front entrance to the building. Inside the building, there was foam built up to the ceiling throughout
the entire social area upstairs. The officer noticed approximately one to one and a half inches of water on the
upstairs floor when he began to walk toward the basement stairway. As the officer opened the stairway door, water was
seen flowing down the stairs to the basement floor. The Davidson Fire Dept. shut off the main power to the
building to keep the risk of fire to a minimum. Davidson Fire advised him of the safety hazards and advised
the officer that a Fire Watch would need to be maintained at the building until the physical plant was able
to repair the fire alarm system. Upon discussing the situation with Kappa Sigma, the officer was advised that the Physical
Plant and the RLO were aware of the type of party they were having and approved it. The officer was
able to salvage the Social Event Registration Form, and it does note that the name of the event is a
“Foam Party” and shows an approval by a person with the initials AC. It is unclear whether the equipment used
during the party was intended for indoor use. Based on the fire department’s requirement of a fire watch, the fraternity
would be required to maintain around-the-clock fire watch until the fire alarm was repaired.
