**Court Squad Works Hard In Preparation For Season Opening**

This year’s final game for both teams. On past records this season, the game should be a passing versus ground
power battle. To date, the Cats have been unable to show much through the line, but have used passes to
advantage. Wake has lacked a good passer, something which has handicapped them in every game, but which has been partially
made up for by the caliber of their running attack.

**Past Scores**

Leading the Demon Deacon runners will be Jimmy Ringgold, winner of the Mills Blocking Trophy, and a blocking back who
can stand alongside any other in the country. Behind him will be two of the Conference's leading scorers, John Polanski,
and Red Mayberry. Besides these, Coach Peahead Walker will present two other fine backs in Tony Gallovich and Marshall Edwards.
With Polanski plunging, Mayberry kicking, Gallovich and Edwards running wide, and Ringgold blocking, the Cats will be hard put to
stop the Deacs.

Duke brushed aside State last Saturday 28-0, and thereby gained a tie. Boasting a perfect season, with the exception of
a set-back at the hands of Pitt, the Blue Devils were able to finish the season without a single loss
in the conference. William and Mary were able to end their season with two victories and one tie against conference
opponents. Starting ends, Gales McClintock and Footsie Cowan, this week, breaking his leg in mid-season, leaves behind two years as
a link in the line.

**U. N. C. vs. Virginia**

North Carolina, with one game remaining, has a record of five wins against a single loss. This week the Tar
Heels meet Virginia.

**RUPERT PATE**

Playing his last game for Wake Forest's Demon Deacons tomorrow will be Rupert Pate, 200-pound captain. Pate, one of the
few North Carolinians on the Baptist squad, hails from Goldsboro. His outstanding tackle play this season, especially in the Duke
game, has attracted wide-spread comment.

**Davidson's improved soccer team turned on a powerful attack to defeat the Clemson Tigers by the count of 4-1 in
a game played at Richardson Field last Friday.**

Bill Bolin has been a steady player and three-back, playing most of the time. These men will be playing for
the last time in a black and red football uniform against Wake Forest, a traditional rival, and a high-ranking team
this year, which adds up to the fact that they will be playing for keeps, and that the whole team
will shoot the works in an effort to upset this favored opponent.

**Unable to score through the line, Davidson Frosh took to the air in the last two quarters and set back
the stubborn Wofford Pups, 25-13, here at Richardson Field last Friday. Davidson played without the aid of one of the
regulars, Joe Gammon, who was out of the game with a leg injury.**to Greensboro outfit is really an up-and-comer, whereas
Little Ridge jit was — today. Johnny Fredericks, ace Kitten, last contest of the year for Tuesday to tangle with
the Duke Blue Devils.

In the first half, and overpowered in the second, against ten back, set up all four Witten Davidson's “B” team
canceled the “B” team. Blue Devils.

Their scheduled game with the “B” team from Catawba due to the Beesters had canceled their last game with Catawba
for sundry reasons. Their Iecs-Men: onume as the most interesting game played here this year West Dormitory from the one-foot
line, after the ball had been placed there by a fifteen-yard penalty against Davidson.

Since many Beesters are out for basketball and the rest are being used to run Wake Forest plays against the
varsity, Coach Spearman deemed it advisable to cross the game off the schedule. This return engagement with Catawba, to whom
they lost earlier in the season, but the soccer team was beaten soundly by them last Wednesday.

Davidson's wrestling team, with five returning lettermen to form a varsity nucleus, will begin practice for the 1940 season soon.
A tough six-match schedule has been completed for the "Cats.

Graham McFadyen, star 155 lb. performer, will captain this winter's team. Other lettermen include: Abels, 125 lb. class, Ilford, 135
lb. class, and Crane, 175 lb. class, which leaves vacancies in the 145, 165, and unlimited classes.

Other contenders for the team are Parrish, Johnny Moore, and Ralph Williams, 135 pounders; Hollis, Wilson, and Koontz, 145 pounders;
McDuffie, Bill Bolin, Turner, and Fitzgerald, 175 pounders; and Hipp, Knoeller, and Yoder, heavyweights.

Soon after the half, Fredericks went to work. Maloney for yards put the Pups into scoring position. Fredericks' passes accounted
for or set the stage for three touchdowns that took away Wofford’s early lead.

A smooth passing, deadly shooting clinched the All-Dorm Team crown in the final game of the dormitory tournament last Thursday
by downing the second place Watts team 25 to 17. This victory allowed the West aggregation to keep their undefeated
record, while the defeat threw Watts into a tie for second place with Georgia. McReynolds topped the scores with 9
points. Sutton and Belk led the losers with 7 and 5 respectively.

In the games played last Tuesday, Georgia trounced the Barracks 38 to 14, and Duke lost to Rumple 24 to
11. Scott led the Georgia boys with 18 points, while Jenkins paced the Rumples with 12.

Georgia downed Rumple 40 to 23, and nosed out Duke in an extra period 15 to 12 in other games
played last week.

In the opening round of the inter-fraternity tournament, the A.E.’s downed the Betas 43 to 21 and the Kappa Sigs
trounced the Pikas 30 to 8. Hackney and Crichton led the Sig Alphs with 13 points each, while Schmidt and
Barnwell were best for the losers. Scott garnered 9 for the Kappa Sigs and Brooks managed 4 for the Pikas.
