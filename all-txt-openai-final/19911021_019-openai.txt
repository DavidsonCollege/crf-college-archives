HOW TO SPOT THE NOID
ON YOUR CAMPUS.

Beware. The NOID, that bizarre character that yuks pizzas, is out there somewhere on campus. He could be disguised as
anyone. A major jock. Psych teach. Bowhead. Even your big rival's mascot. But most likely, he’s hanging out, searching for
pizza ‘cause he likes to trash ‘em out—make the crust soggy, splatter sauce all around the box and toss on
the wrong ingredients—before he overnights it to the wrong place so it'll be good and cold when you get it.
Don't get juked. Give Domino's Pizza® a ring and some serious pizza—hot, fresh, made to your order with the best
ingredients—will be at your door in 30 minutes or less. Guaranteed. Domino's Pizza. Nobody Delivers Better™

11am-12am Mon.-Thurs.
11am-1am Fri. & Sat.
