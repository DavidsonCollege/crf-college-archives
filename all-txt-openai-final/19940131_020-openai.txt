Miles Miller and Jason Deaton both placed third at W & L. The Davidson wrestling team won three matches over the holiday break and came within a weight class of winning several more as the resurgence of the Davidson wrestling program continues. One of the wins, a 36-13 decision, came over Longwood - a team Davidson hasn’t beaten in Head Coach Tom Oddo’s ten plus years of being associated with the program.

On Saturday, the Wildcats were at Washington & Lee for an 8-team tournament. Sam Knowles (158) and Robbie Fierro (126) both finished second in their draws. Knowles’ record is now a sterling 14-5 on the season and includes nine pins. Miller has the second-best record on the team at 13-7.

Next up for the Wildcats is the Mid-South Tournament held at Carson Newman in Jefferson City, TN. “This is one of our more difficult tournaments of the year,” said Oddo, “but as well as we’ve been wrestling I would expect us to have at least three or four wrestlers place in the meet.”

Narat’s leadership and importance to this team was nowhere more evidenced than in the game versus UTC when the Wildcats did little more than watch the game during the first half. Narat kept his team in the game with twelve points in that half, doubling the effort of any teammate. McKillop hopes that Narat will continue to prove to be an excellent role model, not just during their games but also in practices. “If that happens, our current class of sophomores could be a class of Janko's by the time they are seniors.”

If the designated go-to man at game’s end can continue that improvement, then Narat’s chances of playing professionally seem quite good. According to McKillop, “I think that Janko will definitely play somewhere at the next level. He has to improve his athleticism and diversify his game a little more, but with his passion, I know he will commit himself to doing that.”

But what happened at the end of the win over UTC with Alpert hitting that important shot raises the question of whether clutch performer status is being passed to the younger player. Alpert, however, puts such speculation quickly to rest. “Janko is still our go-to guy.”

Slagle wins Jeffrey Award

Davidson men’s soccer coach Charlie Slagle was presented with the Bill Jeffrey Award at the National Soccer Coaches Association of America’s Annual Convention in Santa Clara, on January 21, 1994. The award is given annually by the Intercollegiate Soccer Association of America in honor of the late Bill Jeffrey, legendary Penn State coach.

Slagle was chosen as the 1993 recipient due to his efforts behind the recent success of the NCAA Division I Men’s Soccer Championship, held, and sold out, at Davidson’s Richardson Field for the past two seasons.

The Davidson Wildcats' center, George Spain, took...When asked about the award, Slagle was quick to point out that it was an indication of the school's hard work. The junior from Columbia, SC, shot 68.8% in high school and his average has carried into college. As of last Monday, Spain had hit 71 of 103 shots from the floor to stand alone at the top in the nation.

Another stat to note is the men's team's free throw percentage, which ranks at 75%.
