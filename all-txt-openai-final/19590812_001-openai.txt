**Davidson College, Davidson, N.C. August 12, 1959, Volume Number 8**

**WELCOME, TREAT**

The editor wishes to extend the hand of welcome to all those newcomers that are joyously pouring onto the beautiful campus of Davidson for the delightful Summer Session.

Tuesday, Friday, and possibly Saturday will bring to Davidson the powerful story of war and the sea. The story is presented by means of a motion picture entitled *The Cruel Sea*. This is worth seeing and if you've seen it, you will want to see it again.

There are those among you who are quite familiar with the various activities and little extras offered to the summer student. Next week - *Away All Boats*.

The Union is packed with new games and inviting books and music.

(Note: The Union is interested in finding someone who will be willing to act as the Executive Projectionist for the College Union Summer Program. Now don't all rush.)

**MUSIC LOVERS**

In answer to some nasty rumors that the Union has purchased no new records since Rogers and Hammerstein's heyday, below is a listing of seven new and only slightly used discs!

**BREAK TONIGHT!!**

Franks and cokes are scheduled for relaxation and informality tonight on the terrace at nine. Bingo, bridge, and the U.S. Steel Hour will comprise the entertainment.

1. Warm - Johnny Mathis
2. Best of Tour - Weavers
3. Academy Award Hits - Pierre
4. From the "Hungry I" - Kingston Trio
5. At Midnight - Josh White
6. Uptown & Newport 1958 - Duke Ellington
7. Mahalia Jackson's Best

To the newcomers: the "Break" tonight is a usual affair held each Wednesday night to afford a bit of free relaxation and refreshments for the overworked studious men who volunteer for the Summer Session. The atmosphere is strictly informal - sort of an open house affair - so take a few minutes off and drop by.
