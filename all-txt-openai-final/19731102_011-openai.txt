USC, Fairies Suffer Losses
In National Pigskin Shake-Up

The NCAA and USC lost
their longest unbeaten streak
Saturday against Notre Dame
and the IMAC lost theirs Sun-
day as powerful Emanon
smashed the Staten Island
Fairies’ 12-game winning streak
with a resounding 54-24 thump-
ing.

The story was Calvin Allen
and Emanon’s superb organ-
ization as they played per-
fect flickerball against the
beleaguered Fairies.

Emanon threw only one in-
terception, stole five them-
selves, and stymied the Fairy
offense with a heady zone defen-
se. The Fairy defense was able
to contain Emanon only three
times, the remaining posses-
sions were converted into
scores by the No Names.

The League 1 situation was
further clarified when SAE No.
1 clobbered C-1 35-6. C-1 has
found themselves overmatched
in League 1. Their lack of
flickerball knowledge has
proved to be their undoing.

SAE’s victory, plus a forfeit
win over the awestruck Fairies
(whose nonappearance was
compounded by a bad case of
the Holland Disease), has put
them nose-to-nose with Emanon
for the League 1 championship.
The winner of this game will un-
doubtedly go on to be the IMAC
regular season champs.

In the actions of ordinary
mortals, Richardson 3 stomped
the hapless Wimpettes Plus 44-
7. I doubt if even the Mad Elf
could help the Wimpettes.

The ATO’s got back to their
old tricks, losing to freshmen S-
4 39-12. S-4 was also stricken
with the mysterious Holland
Disease, but the Zeroes
wouldn’t let that stop them
from losing.

The North Main Gozinyas,
even though picketed by a
group of Baptists, chugged their
way to a 44-21 victory over R-2.
The Gozinyas (led by “Dix”
Hendrix) continue to prove that
repealing the 19th amendment
was the best thing this country
ever did.

Thursday’s action started
with a battle of the inept C-4 vs.
C-3. The “Turkey Bowl” ended
typically as C-3 forfeited the
game. I would have liked to

Harriers Finish Strong
With 7-5 Dual Record

By MARK CONNERS
Asst. Sports Editor

Finishing their dual meet
season with the first winning
record since 1967, the Davidson
cross-country concludes the
season with the Southern Con-
ference Championship this
weekend at Furman University.

Last Monday, the harriers
picked up three wins
defeating High Point, Guilford
and Elon in a tri-meet at High
Point.

Taking first place honors was
Davidson’s Jesse Smith.

According to head coach
Sterling Martin, “Jesse ran a
very strong race. He looked real
good and just seemed
ready for that meet.”

Although the Wildcats swept
all three teams, it was not a par-
ticularly good race for anyone
on the team besides Smith.

One reason for the poor race
is the prevalence of illness and
injury on the team.

Ricky Bell is out with a case
of tendonitis in his knee, Pinckney
is troubled with a bad cold, John
Barksdale’s legs have been
giving a great deal of trouble,
and the remainder of the team
seems to be “just plain tired
out,” according to Martin.

Although plagued with an
assortment of maladies, Mon-
day’s run was enough for the
Wildcat harriers to boost their
record to 7-5, the best dual meet
record for the team in six years.

Martin was “generally
pleased with the overall per-
formance of the team,” and
predicts that this year’s team is
an indication of things to come.

Martin made the distinction
that this year’s edition was one
of the first times that Davidson
really ran as a team and “it
proved to be a very valuable
asset in that almost everyone on
the team at one time or another
was the driving force for the
rest of the runners.”

Proud of their winning
record, the harriers travel to
Furman this weekend for the
conference meet.

“With all the injuries right
now, we probably won’t do as
well as we could have if
everyone had been healthy,”
Martin reluctantly predicted.

Despite the health of the
team, William and Mary is ex-
pected to take the honors this
weekend.

Fielding by far the strongest
team in the Southern Con-
ference, the Indians should
have no difficulty at all in
dominating the entire event.
