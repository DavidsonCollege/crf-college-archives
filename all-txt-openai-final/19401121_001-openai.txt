Report of Convention Given at Regular Meeting

Major Jami McDuffie

His usually deadpan broadened into a wide grin, Ed Lucas is the first to greet the bevy of beauties from Salem College who invaded Davidson's campus Saturday, November 16. The girls arrived at 1:30 p.m. in time to take in the Davidson-Hampden-Sydney game. A dating bureau was set up in front of Chambers to serve as a medium for the meeting of the girls and their prospective dates. The more than 100 girls who made the trip left the campus at 9 p.m. after a pleasant but cold afternoon and evening of football, supper, and various other little unmentionable details.

The event was sponsored by the Beaver Club, of which Ed Lucas is president. Every year during football season Davidson plays host to some girls’ school.

He said that R.O.T.C. units were the main character-building factor in colleges and universities. While delegates were in Washington, they toured the city, seeing all major points of interest. The next convention for Scabbard and Blade will be held at Salt Lake City, Utah, in 1941.
