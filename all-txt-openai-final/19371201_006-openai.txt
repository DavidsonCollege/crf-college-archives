Arrayed in the finery that marks him as the best dressed young man not only in Charlotte but in Davidson also, Sophomore Paul McGarity, Jr., (left) is shown here receiving the congratulations of Dr. Frazer Hood, the nattiest dressed man in these parts. Dr. Hood is the acknowledged fashion plate in Davidson, having a correct costume for every occasion.

The following made varsity letters in football this year:
Bailey Williams, “Nick” Nicholson, Ned Iverson, Dave Warden, Luke Graham, “Red” Miller, Spencer Goodman, Bill Johnston, Haywood Hill, George Richmond, Frank Purdy, Bob Abell, “Teeny” Lafferty, Fred Dennis, Fred Stair, Bill Haywood.

These made service letters: Capt. Williams, Lafferty, Dennis, Bob Green, “Chubby” King, Purdy, Hill, Graham, Goodman, Smith, Johnny Sadler, Charles Nicholson, all of whom donned a white shirt or white collar. 

Yates Faison, Dorsett, and others made managers' letters. Coach Harrison proved his worth with several nice runs to his credit. 

Introducing, “Five Cigar Bailey,” named Joe Bailey. He smokes more cigars than any other. When he is not dissipating with his cigars, he is developing pictures. For this, he is called “Negative Bailey.”

Wirtz and Hustler were the standouts. Their “around-the-end plays” were menacing to the ‘Cats. Captain Boots Munson played a bang-up defensive game to his credit.
