Smith were featured as soloists during the performance. Last Sunday evening at the Vesper services, the Glee Club also rendered a special number of sacred music. The students seemed to enjoy this very much, so why not have these much more often, Mr. Berg?

The symphonic band has certainly been hitting the road this week, including two performances over WBT radio network, affiliated with CBS, the Columbia Broadcasting System. Last Tuesday night at 10:30 the band gave a fifteen-minute program at Sherer Hall connected with WBT. On Wednesday evening the band returned to Charlotte to also help WBT celebrate its 25th birthday. Early Thursday morning the band left for Asheville where it will be featured in a number of concerts. This is the third off-campus appearance of the band this semester—the first at Salisbury, and a more recent one at Converse College.

Everyone is certainly happy to see the Phi Mu Alpha in Phi Hall open for student use now. The room is there and is regularly opened every afternoon before supper, and several nights during the week. Why not get into the habit of dropping by now and then, and listen to a few numbers. Requests are heartily received.

The Noehren-Berg combination concert this week introduced to the audience a number of excellent pieces, rendered to perfection by the two participants. Now that these two have revealed their talents to the student body, what about Mr. Pfohl giving us a concert so that we can really see just how he can make that organ sound?

We'll close this week's music column with a few definitions taken from the 1943 edition of Esar’s Comic Dictionary.

Modern Music: It's played so fast and hot, you can’t tell what song is being played, much less what song it was stolen from.
Sour music: A malady.
Musician: 1. A person who earns his living just by playing around. 2. Many a musician who plays Beethoven, should play bridge.
True Musician: One who, when he hears a lady singing in her bath, puts his ear to the keyhole.
Violin: Many a violin sounds as though its strings were still in the cat.
Violinist: One who is always up to his chin in music.

FIGURE THIS OUT
Three Phi Betas walk into a blacked-out room in which there are three white hats and two black hats. Each takes a hat and puts it on, and walks out, one behind the other. Neither one of the three looks around, seeing only the one or ones in front of him. The rear man says that he doesn’t know what color his hat is; the middle man makes the same statement; and the first man says that he knows the color of his hat. What is the color of his hat and how did he arrive at the solution? There are no tricks involved.

ANSWER TO THE RIDDLE
The man in front had on a white hat. The reasoning is as follows: The rear man could either have seen (1) two white hats or (2) a white and a black hat, because if he had seen two black hats he would have known that he had on a white hat since there are only two black hats. If the middle man had seen a black hat on the man in front of him he would have known that he was wearing a white hat because of (2) above. Since he did not know the color of his hat, it is quite obvious that the front man had on a white hat.
