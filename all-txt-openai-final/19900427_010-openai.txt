**Men's Tennis Finishes Strong**

By ROBERT GRUBB

The men’s tennis team ended their season with an impressive performance over the weekend at the Hampton Inn Classic. Davidson
hosted the Citadel, Furman, and UNCC during the second annual season-ending tournament. Davidson defeated the Citadel 10-2 on Friday, sweeping
all 8 singles matches. On Saturday, the Wildcats came back with another fine performance but were defeated by Furman, the
regular season champs of the Southern Conference.

Coach Jeff Frank was happy with the performance of his squad. “On Friday, we played as well as we have
all year, top to bottom,” said Frank. “Even though we lost on Saturday, most of the matches were evenly played
and went to three sets or to tiebreakers.”

Because of the one-sidedness of the matches on Friday and Saturday, the four teams played a random schedule of matches
on Sunday. The ‘Cats finished the last two weeks of the season strongly; wins over Belmont Abbey, Pfeiffer, and Queens
set their final record at 14-13. Said Frank of his 18th consecutive winning season, “We played some of our best
tennis at the end of the year. I feel like we ended our season on a positive note.”

The Davidson Rugby team is back on its feet again after falling apart early in 1988. The club team has
had a difficult schedule for its first year but has made its presence felt as a future rugby force in
North Carolina. UNCC, Duke, and ECU proved to be tall orders for the young Wildcats, who returned just seven players.
But much new enthusiasm added to the experience and enabled the team to offer a challenging game to any opponent.

**Track Ends Season With Excellent Performance**

By JAY CLUGSTON

The men’s and women’s track teams ended their seasons with exciting performances and personal records at the April 13-14 Duke
Invitational, and the April 20-21 Furman Invitational.

At Duke, the men produced seven personal bests in ten performances. “It was there,” said senior David Murray, referring to
the preparedness of his legs after a two-week tapering off period in the distance crew’s training. “Coach Andrew had us
ready.” Murray lowered his 10,000-meter personal best time by 54 seconds to 31:41.0, and in the process became Davidson’s number
two all-time fastest 10K performer. Moving into the number three spot in the same category during the same race was
sophomore Chris Otrok with a time of 32:16.2. He was followed by freshman David Kerns in 33:10. The guys went
out so hard in this race that Murray was below his best times at the 3200, 5000, and 8000 meter
splits (9:59, 15:41, and 25:20).

Freshman Ian Stewart ran the team’s fastest 5,000 meters for the season (15:40.4), removing 22 seconds from his previous best.
Freshman Peter Hurtado and senior Jay Clugston combined for a strong 1,500 meter showing with times of 4:03.7 and 4:05.4,
and freshman Ben Wiley lowered his 800 meter time by over 2.5 seconds to 2:00.8. Wiley will surely break 2
minutes next year.

The Furman meet meant a “change of race” for most of the guys as they ran races they had not
specifically trained for. Ian Stewart began the changes with his first ever 3,000 meter steeplechase. Despite minimal experience going over
barriers, Stewart ran a 10:29.8, and then the next day came back to run his personal best time in the
1500 meter (4:13.4). Peter Hurtado and Chris Otrok placed first and second in the 2 mile with times of 9:45.4,
and 9:48.2. With this performance, Hurtado became the season leader in four events for the Wildcats (1600 m relay split
52.3, 800m 1:58.05, 1500m 4:03.7, 2 mile 9:45.4). “He may be short, but those Italian legs of his can really
turn over. Pete has had a sensational freshman season,” said Coach Andrew.

Both Hurtado and Otrok came back on Saturday to run strong races again. Otrok won the 5,000 (15:53.1), and Hurtado
placed 2nd in the 800 meters, running a 1:59.8.with a negative split (faster last 400 meters than first) of 59
seconds. Also in the 800 meters, Jay Clugston placed 4th with a personal best time of 2:01.6. Senior Robby “Sage”
McKay moved up from the 1500 meters to run his first 5000 meters in 17:18. The 1600 meter relay team
of freshman Dan Franks, Wiley, Hurtado, and Clugston closed out the year with its seasonal best 4:38.49.

Sophomore Kathy Beach continued her record-breaking ways for the women’s team at the Duke Invitational. Beach lowered her own school
3,000 meter record from 10:23 to 10:10.06. Freshman Jennifer Brown ran a 2:24.2 800 meters which lowered her previous best
time by more than 2 seconds, and freshman Heather Tarpley continued to display versatility, contributing strong performances in the 100
and 400 meter hurdles (16.91, 69.02), and 400 meters (62.6). At the Duke meet, assistant coach and 1989 NCAA Division
I All American Beth Manson showcased her discus throwing abilities, winning the competition with a throw of 148’3". Coach Manson
also placed fourth in the shot with a put of 44’2 3/4". Her strong performances followed just minimal practice since
last June.

The next week, Manson enjoyed coaching all of her throwers to personal bests at the Furman Invitational. Jenny White threw
the javelin 77’5” for 5th place. Deidra Montague and Susan Swift put the shot 26’5" and 33’10.5" (3rd place), respectively,
and Heather Tarpley threw the discus 111’8” for 4th place. Tarpley also placed 2nd in the 100 meter hurdles (16.4)
and 2nd in the 400 meter hurdles (70.3). Kathy Beach won the 1500 meters easily in 4:53.4, and combined with
Jennifer Brown to place Davidson 1st and 2nd in the 800 meters. Beach’s 800 meter time of 2:23.8 is her
personal best, and Brown ran 2:24.5, just slightly over her best time.

The Wildcats lose only three men and two women to graduation and plan to better this year’s strong showing next
spring. Stay tuned for cross country this coming fall.

Mooresville Native Recipient of First Women's Athletic Scholarship

Davidson’s basketball future grew brighter in the last few weeks when coach Bob McKillop signed two highly-regarded players to national
letters of intent. Point guard Pat Holloway comes to Davidson from George Washington H.S. in Denver, Colorado. He averaged 23.1
points, 6.0 assists and 4.8 rebounds during his senior campaign, prompting the Denver Post to name him to its All-City
and All-State first teams. Said McKillop, “Pat brings a variety of abilities to our program. He’s an excellent ballhandler who
can be creative. He can shoot the three-point shot, too. Pat is capable of drawing fouls and is an excellent
foul shooter.”

Forward Scott Alford played his senior season at Maine Central Institute in Pittsfield, Maine. His statistics (11 ppg, 6 rpg,
4 apg) seem unimpressive until one takes into account that his team compiled a 24-0 record and distributed nine players
to Division I colleges. He also shot 52 percent from the floor and 87 percent from the free-throw line. McKillop
calls Alford a “jack of all trades. He handles the ball well and is an outstanding passer. He also shoots
with range. Because of his skills and size, Scott has excellent versatility.”

This year’s Wildcat squad loses five seniors to graduation, including point guard and MVP Alan Hunter, so a youth movement
is in effect, led by rising sophomores Detlef Musch and J.D. Heuer. McKillop hopes to sign at least three more
players, and has combed the nation’s high schools and junior colleges in search of players capable of contributing immediately.

Meanwhile, Mooresville’s own Jennifer Satterfield etched her name into the annals of Davidson athletics when she signed an athletic grant-in-aid
to play women’s soccer, thereby becoming the recipient of Davidson's first women’s athletic scholarship. Satterfield served as co-captain of the
boys’ soccer team at Mooresville High, which won the Class AA North Carolina state championship with a 17-2-2 record. Satterfield
has three times been chosen to the U.S. Youth Soccer Association Region III player pool, and was named an honorable
mention all-conference selection her senior season. Coach Diane Boettcher feels that “Jennifer will contribute immediately with strong technical ability and
perceptive play.” The women’s soccer team turned in a respectable 4-7-1 ledger in its initial campaign a year
