8 women and 23 men have yet to find housing

Nicholls sees few problems

By PAM CAMERRA

"There are fewer people without room assignments this year than last year," said Director of Student Housing Scotty Nicholls after the housing lottery last week.

Eight rising sophomore women and 23 rising sophomore men did not receive rooms in the lottery. Problems still exist because a number of juniors and seniors have not contacted Nicholls to tell her their living plans for next year. In addition, some students have not paid their $200 deposit and therefore were not allowed to participate in the drawing.

Nicholls will solve these problems before school ends and during the summer.

The eight girls will probably live in basement Cannon next year if the basement is not filled by freshmen women.

"We didn’t have enough rooms for everyone, but then we don’t want to, because we don’t want to have empty beds in the fall," said Nicholls.

There is a normal attrition of students between April and September, according to Nicholls.

"Some people who get rooms in the lottery don’t come back, and others are looking for a place off-campus but took part in the drawing as a safety measure."

Nicholls said, "At this point we couldn’t let additional girls go off-campus, and we probably can’t let more men off-campus, or we would have empty rooms in the fall."

PIRG cans returnables

On Wednesday, May 4, Davidson students are being invited to temporarily part with their books in return for a showing of their support.

The Citizens for Returnable Beverage Containers has asked NC PIRG and other coalition groups to mobilize their members at a public legislative hearing in Raleigh that would influence the outcome of the returnables legislation.

Otherwise known as the "bottle bill," the measure (HB 697) would prohibit all non-returnable cans and bottles as well as flip-top containers while placing a minimum returnable deposit of $.05 on returnable cans and bottles so as to encourage their reuse.

A study made by NC PIRG found that adoption of this proposal would result in less litter, energy savings, an increase in jobs, resource conservation along with solid waste reduction and a cheaper product to both producers and consumers.

Faculty members are also being approached to support this act by doing whatever they can to encourage students to exercise their democratic rights. Students are presently scheduled to testify before this hearing which begins at 10 am in the Legislative Building.

The group will be leaving from the back of Cunningham Fine Arts Building at 6:30 am due to the early hearing and are scheduled to return later in the afternoon.

Name that night

Davidson College will initiate a new entertainment tradition beginning with next year’s Homecoming. A student talent night with a very special slant is slated.

This show will be comparable to the "Gator Growl" at the University of Florida or the "Tigerama" night at Clemson. The idea is to have quality student acts, especially satirical skits aimed at those things that Davidson venerates; i.e. grades, fraternities, non-fraternities, Slater, etc.

The suggested name is "Wildcat Whoopee," but the Homecoming Committee hopes to do better than that. So the Committee is sponsoring a contest to Name That Night. Think of an applicable name for this new annual event and submit it.

The contest begins this Thursday and runs through Friday, May 6. Submit suggestions at Mrs. Archie’s desk in the Dean of Students’ Office.

The Committee will decide which name is the best and award its creator $25.

Summer can be fun if you know a few common things to avoid:

1. Do not swim at any beach where they have loudspeakers playing the soundtrack from "Jaws."
2. Do not, under any circumstances, try to pick up a cow.
3. Do not answer any want ad for a summer job that sounds too good to be true—unless you enjoy selling steak knives.
4. Do not tell your parents that, after graduation, you have decided on an exciting career in motel management.
5. Do not accept a date from anyone wearing a green leisure suit and roller skates.
6. Do not, under any circumstances, attempt to feed your pet gerbil a boa constrictor.
7. Do not forget the one word for beer. As your Dean of Beer, I can think of nothing more important for you to remember.

So have fun, have Schlitz, and I'll see you next fall.

WHEN IT'S RIGHT, YOU KNOW IT.
