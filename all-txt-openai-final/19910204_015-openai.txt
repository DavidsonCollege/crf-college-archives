Woody's Athletes
Of The Week

This week’s Woody’s Athlete
of the Week is basketball player
Detlef Musch, a 7’0" sophomore
from Fulda, Germany.

Last year, as a freshman,
Musch averaged a shade under ten
points per game.

This season (only his sixth of
organized basketball), aided by off-
season weight training, he has
continued to improve, and recently,
it seems, has come into his own as
an aggressive force in the pivot.

Last week, in games against
UNCC, Augusta and Miami,
Musch averaged 17 points and
nearly 8 rebounds per game, in-
cluding a brilliant 19 point, 13
rebound effort against UNCC. In
those three contests, he shot a
scorching 71% from the field.

Kathy Beach
Last week’s Woody’s Athlete
of the Week was track captain
Kathy Beach, a junior from Platts-
burgh, New York. Last year, she
broke school records in 8 of the 10
indoor and outdoor track meets.

This fall, she continued her ram-
page through the record books in
cross-country. Her 18:58 5K at the
NCAA Division I Region III meet
was the fastest in school history,
and her 91st place finish made her
the first Davidson woman ever to
crack the top 100 in the NCAA
meet. January 19, at the Santee-
Marriott Invitational at Virginia
Tech, she set a school record in the
indoor mile with a 5:21.3 clock-
ing. A week later at the US Air
Invitational at East Tennessee
State, she set the record in the
indoor 3,000 meters with a time of
10:41.7. Already, without a doubt,
the finest distance runner in
Davidson history, Beach could
forseeably leave Davidson with
every distance record in her pos-
session. Kathy’s selection as
WAoTW entitles her to a free din-
ner for two at Woody’s restaurant,
Highway 73 in Cornelius.

Women's Track Rewriting Records

By Peter Hurtado

The women’s track and field
team continues to rewrite the rec-
ord books, as the Wildcats have
now set 7 records in their first three
weeks of competition. Three of
these records came in relay events,
as the women have displayed new
depth.

Last Saturday at the Lynchburg
Invitational, the versatile Heather
Tarpley achieved school records
in both the shot put (33’5") and the
400m dash (62.08), finishing first
overall in both events. This brings
Heather’s school record total to
three set this winter, including the
shot put, 400m, and the 500m.
Heather’s outstanding showing for
Davidson also included a 1st place
finish in the 800m in 2:38.3.

Captain Kathy Beach contin-
ued her stellar season at the USAir
Invitational at ETSU last Satur-
day. Beach broke her own record
in the 3000m run, finishing in
10:41.7.

Freshwoman Jennifer
Humphrey began her indoor sea-
son at Lynchburg with a solid
performance of 72.2 in the 400m,
placing 7th. Jennifer will run the
400 hurdles this spring for the
Wildcats.

In a spectacular day for the
women’s squad, the lady Wildcats
set three school records in relays at
the Pepsi Relays at VA Tech. Led
by Kathy Beach’s 2:26 anchor leg,
the 4x800 team of Heather Tar-
pley, Jennifer Brown, Karen
Marshall, and Beach set a new
standard of 10:02.3 to place 4th at
the meet.

The sprint medley relay team
(400m, 200m, 200m, 800m) of
Brown (68.3), Tarpley (27.9),
Jennifer Humphrey (31.6), and
Beach (2:27.5) set a new school
record of 4:35.0 to place 4th.

Only minutes following the
end of the sprint medley relay,
Humphrey, Tarpley, and Beach ran
to the start of the Distance Medley
Relay. No matter—the women set a
new school record of 13:56.1.
Senior Katie Reynolds led off with
a 4:15 1200m, and was followed
by Humphrey (400m), Tarpley
(800), and Beach (mile).

Coaches Gary Andrew and
Beth Manson were quite impressed
with the early efforts of the
women’s team, and look for their
success to continue.
