Phi Mu Alpha Will Sponsor Annual Sing

Miss Katherine Pfohl, Mrs. J. T. Bonner, and Professor E. A. Beatty Are Judges

The annual Davidson Inter-Fraternity Sing will be held on the night of Friday, May 7th at 7:30 on the front
steps of Chambers Building. This program will be a part of the Mother’s Day celebration and will be sponsored by
Phi Mu Alpha, Davidson honorary musical fraternity.

Each of the nine social fraternities will participate in the event. An added attraction this year will be provided by
the Air Corps who will enter a group in the competition. A prize will be given to the group which
presents the best program. The winner will be decided by a special committee of judges; the judges have been selected
and will consist of a group of three: Miss Katherine Pfohl, Instructor in Voice at Limestone College, Gaffney, S. C.;
Mrs. J. T. Bonner; and Professor E. A. Beatty of the faculty. The Master of Ceremonies for the occasion will
be Dr. J. W. McConnell. There will also be a special attraction of the program which will consist of a
chorus of the Air Corps Cadets.

The prize which will be awarded will be the silver cup which is now in the possession of Beta Theta
Pi fraternity. Last year, in addition to the 1st prize, there was awarded a cup to the best director and
one year there was a cup given by Fred Waring to the fraternity rendering the best version of the “Alma
Mater” which he wrote for Davidson.

The events will be judged on four points, to rank as follows: Originality, 20%; Presentation, 20%; Song Selection, 10%; Quality,
40%. Entries must not be less than 6½ minutes long or more than eight minutes long. At least three-fourths of
the chapter must take part in the singing.

LETTERS FROM LODGES (Continued from Page 3)
day last week to rest up and immediately returned to his Richmond haunts. Brother Preston Oliver journeyed to his home
in Wilmington on a fishing expedition (you should have seen the one that got away big brown eyes). Also to
his home went Brother Leighton Meston and became engaged. The Fijis are looking forward to a big dance weekend in
“cahoots” with the Phi Delts. Friday night they will swing out to the tunes of Fleet Green and his orchestra.

Y’s CORNER (Continued from Page 3)
You see, even the men who are not outwardly as in agreement with what the “Y” stands for as some
others are, each is important. Some back us in our beliefs; others make us more certain by challenge. Too, I
still have an idea that men at Davidson, even though they are not all “Y Men” in the accepted sense
on the campus, pretty nearly always turn out to be so after leaving. Records prove it, and more than that—many
of the fellows admit it now! Anyway, Davidson and you have meant much to me because you have shown me
so plainly the happiness in and the necessity of knowing Jesus Christ.
Yours, Shaw Smith.
