OUR CONTEMPORARIES.

The Virginia Tech—"Monk” Young-

letic Council at V. M. I. it was decided
to give medals to the various managers
of the teams this year instead of mono-
grams, as has been the custom hereto-
fore.

College Topics—Rev. “Gypsy” Smith,
Jr., delivered an address entitled “From
Gypsy Tent to Pulpit,” to a large and
enthusiastic audience recently at the
University of Virginia.

Ring-Tum-Phi—For several years the
football team at Washington and Lee
has been given sweaters and watch chain
footballs, and the money for these has
been raised by popular subscription. This
year it is hoped that sufficient money
will be raised from the receipts on the
reports of games held away from Lex-
ington to pay for the sweaters and foot-
balls.

The Stetson Weekly Collegiate—A
new policy will be adopted this year at
Stetson University for the positions on
the staff of the paper. There will be a
period of four weeks’ probation, and
those who work the hardest during the
four weeks will be elected to the staff.
The election will be based strictly on
merit.

The Mississippian—At the University
of Mississippi a certain day is called
class organization day. All recitations
are suspended at 12 o'clock and the re-
maining time before dinner is given over
to the election of the officers of the
various classes.

The Vanderbilt Hustler—Cheering
and rooting are to be especially empha-
sized at Vanderbilt now. Besides the
general yelling by the student body, a
special section will be roped off for those
volunteering their services as rooters.
These men will be arranged in the root-
ing section in such a manner as to form
a human V in the school colors. The
three new cheer leaders are to have spe-
cial flannel suits in Vandy's colors, gold
and black, with knitted caps to go with
them.

FACULTY LECTURE
ON FRIDAY NIGHT

The first of the Faculty Lectures for
the year will be given Friday night, Oc-
tober 27th, in Shearer Hall, in the form
of a six-reel moving picture. The pic-
tures to be presented were taken by Sir
Douglas Mawson during an Australian
Antarctic Expedition, and show the ani-
mal, bird, and deep-sea life of the South
Seas. As there is a rather large expense
attached to getting the picture here,
there will be an admission price of 25
cents charged. The operator will bring
his own machine, screen, etc., with him.

The Mawson pictures have scored a
success in various parts of the country.
Below are a few of the press comments:

New York Herald: “Held large
audience spell-bound.”

New York Sun: “Remarkable pic-
tures. Greatly amusing.”
“The Penguin is the originator of the
Charlie Chaplin Walk. The expedition
was the largest in the history of explora-
tion. It was composed of sixty-six uni-
versity graduates. It covered a period
of 27 months and cost $300,000."

The Faculty have decided to present
only this one lecture in the fall with sev-
eral to follow in the spring. Their plan
is to present not quite so many lectures
this year and to make them better and
more interesting than those of last year.

Mr. C. I. Mathews led the Christian
Endeavor meeting last Sunday afternoon.
The subject was “Manliness,” and sev-
eral members made very interesting
talks on this subject.
