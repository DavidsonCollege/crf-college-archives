TREBLE CLEF CLUB HERE THURSDAY NIGHT

The Lyceum attraction that was given last Thursday night by the Treble Clef Club was one of the best that
has been seen here. A very attractive and humorous part of the program was a dramatic monologue. One of the
ladies represented a number of characters and not a few times caused the hall to roar with applause and laughter.
She has a remarkable talent for representing different characters both in appearance and voice. Although the monologue was very much
enjoyed, music was the main part of the program. The minds of the audience were carried back to slavery times
when, dressed in ginghams and with banjo in hand, the ladies appeared and began singing, accompanied by the banjo, the
old plantation melodies. The mimicry was perfect and one had only to close his eyes to imagine he were listening
to the darkies of the '60s. Popular songs were also sung. Toward the last of the program two ladies, dressed
in Colonial style, appeared on the stage and sang old songs and danced the minuet. Among others, they sang the
sweet old songs, "Just a Song at Twilight," and "The Sweetest Story Ever Told." The quartet closed the program by
singing "Songs My Mother Used to Sing," and others. The program was well rendered throughout and thoroughly enjoyed.

PLANS FOR SOPH BANQUET.
Forty of the Sophs have already signed up for the annual Soph Banquet and it is expected that many more
will go, as a thorough canvass has not yet been made of all the dormitories. The banquet is to be
held at the Central Hotel, Charlotte, which has recently been remodeled, and is now under new management. February 21 has
been chosen as the most suitable date. As usual, a special train will return to Davidson after the banquet, but
the regular trains will be used on the down trip.

BUSINESS FIRM MOVES.
The recent heavy rains have seriously undermined the foundations of the Armour Bros. & Thompson building, necessitating the removal of
that firm to the old Cranford store building. The floor of the Armour building has sagged dangerously in some places,
pulling the shelving completely from the walls. The building will be remodeled, and then re-occupied by the same firm. The
Jetton Drug Co. building, next door, is undamaged.

Furman University—The DAVIDSONIAN welcomes to its exchanges The Hornet, Furman’s new weekly. It is small but neat and should look
forward to a period of rapid growth.
