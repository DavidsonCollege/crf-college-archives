FIRST CHAPEL—
"not with a bang, but a whimper"

DR. PIETENPOL, Dean of the Faculty, opened the first and only unseated Chapel of the Summer Session. He introduced the Acting Dean of Students C. SHAW SMITH, who is serving in that capacity in the European absence of Dean Spencer.

Mr. Smith stated that he would be available to students at all times, but most particularly during his office hours from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. The Acting Dean expressed his interest in student life and pled that his sincerity be tested.

Rising Senior Clyde Robinson, President of the S.S. (here and hereafter used to denote Summer Session, and not to be confused with a committee of recent significance) Student Council, swore in the members of the Judicial Body. This group was selected by the newly elected Council of the regular session.

The S.S. Council includes WATT McCAIN, JOHN REGEN, HARLEY SMITH, BO ABERNETHY, STUART COLLINS, HARRY PETERSON, MURRAY PAGE, LACY KISLER, and JIM FOIL. Despite apparent verbal incompetence manifested Thursday last, it is believed that our Council can and will be effective when it ‘speaks with one voice.’

Other S.S. leaders were acknowledged during the initial chapel. DOLPH ALLEN is serving as President of the YMCA. SMITTY JOHNSON is in charge of the Voluntary Vespers, and he urged attendance at these student-conducted services.

RUFUS CROMARTIE heads up the S.S. Social Committee which will provide us with a weekly Wednesday interlude at the Union from 9:00 p.m. 'til. Summer Frolics is to be under the direction of RAY HARDING.

N.C. MEN OF SYNOD

The fourth meeting of the Men of the Synod of North Carolina opens tonight at Davidson College. This conclave will last through Sunday with approximately 200 delegates staying on the campus and several hundred more commuting to all or some of the sessions.

The theme of the weekend conference is "Forward With Christ." The keynote address is to be given tonight by Dr. JAMES A. JONES, moderator of the Synod of North Carolina, and President-elect of Union Theological Seminary.

Dr. ELTON TRUEBLOOD, influential author, teacher, and philosopher, will deliver the main address on Saturday night. Dr. Trueblood delivered the Otts Lectures at Davidson in the Spring of 1953.

The sermon on Sunday morning will be given by Dr. LOUIS EVANS, formerly of the First Presbyterian Church of Hollywood, California. Students are welcome at this service.

FROM OUR PRESIDENT—
‘there we go round the prickly pear...’

A HEARTY WELCOME TO YOU NEW STUDENTS. AS SUMMER PRESIDENT OF THE STUDENT BODY, I WOULD LIKE TO CALL TO THE ATTENTION OF ALL STUDENTS THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR HONOR SYSTEM.

THE HONOR SYSTEM OFFERS US THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASSUME MATURELY THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF SELF-GOVERNMENT. THE CORE OF THESE RESPONSIBILITIES IS FOUND WITHIN THE HONOR SYSTEM TO WHICH WE ALL ASCRIBE OUR ALLEGIANCE BY OUR VERY PRESENCE HERE.

WE PLEDGE OURSELVES TO KEEP THE CAMPUS FREE FROM CHEATING, STEALING, AND LYING UNDER OATH BOTH BY PERSONAL ABSTINENCE AND BY REFUSING TO ALLOW OTHERS TO DISHONOR THE SYSTEM AND THEMSELVES.

TO MAINTAIN THE HONOR SYSTEM AND THUS TO PERFORM OUR DUTIES AS MEMBERS OF THE DAVIDSON STUDENT BODY, WE MUST FORGET OUR HIGH SCHOOLISH FEAR OF TATTLING AND REALIZE THAT CONSTANT VIGILANCE IS THE PRICE OF SELF-GOVERNMENT. IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE WEIGHT OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR MAINTAINING THE HONOR CODE RESTS NOT PRIMARILY ON THE STUDENT COUNCIL, BUT ON ALL OF US.

RACQUET AND RACKET

Sun-baked juveniles have been serving it out this week in the Southern Junior and Boy's Tennis Championship on the D.C. courts. The finals will be played off on Saturday morning, and the victorious will qualify for the National Junior Tennis Championship to be held at Kalamazoo, Mich.

In the semi-finals held this morning, the Boy's division (under 15 years of age) had matches between Ned Neely of Atlanta and Doug Stewart, and Leslie Nicholson of Memphis and Ernest Potter of Anniston, Ala.
