Pat was taking Professor Jones down the river in a rowboat.

“Pat,” said the professor, “have you ever studied zoology?”

“No,” said Pat, “I don’t know nothing about it.”

“Why, you’ve missed half your life,” was the reply. Then, a little later, “Do you know anything about biology?”

“Nope,” grunted Pat.

“Well, you’ve missed half your life,” replied the professor.

Just then the boat hit a snag and upset.

“Help,” sputtered the professor.

“Hey, Professor,” yelled Pat, “do ye know anything about swimminology?”

“No,” gasped the professor.

“Then in a few moments you're gonna miss your whole life,” cried Pat, as he struck out for the shore.
