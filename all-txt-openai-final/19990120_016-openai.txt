### Wrestlers Sweep W&L Quad Meet
By David Moncurre, Staff Writer

The wrestlers started out the season a little slow but have picked up the pace as of late, winning three of their last four to improve their overall record to 4-6. After winning the season opener against Wagner by a score of 21-19, the Wildcats experienced a losing streak against Boston College, Columbia, Anderson, Duquesne, and Slippery Rock. The team then turned things around and swept a quad meet at Washington & Lee on January 9. The ‘Cats were victorious over Pensacola (28-18), Washington & Lee (32-10), and Johns Hopkins (43-3).

The highlight of the season so far has been the success the wrestlers had at the quad meet at Washington & Lee. In the first match against Pensacola, Davidson notched six individual wins to help lead the team to victory. Dan Carman, Miles Cox, Jeff Bender, Ian Kaplan, Alan Roe, and Jeff Storms all came out victorious against Pensacola.

The Wildcat wrestlers were matched up against the hosts of the meet, Washington & Lee, in their second match of the day. Carman, Kaplan, Roe, and Storms were again the victors in their matches. Ryan Owens, Anthony Albert, and Charles Waldron added victories of their own to help lead the ‘Cats to a team victory for the second time that day.

In the final match of the day, the ‘Cats finished with their most decisive victory of the tournament, 43-3 over Johns Hopkins. This was the greatest team effort the Wildcats had amassed thus far with Kaplan, Roe, Justin Perkinson, Andrew Friedman, Storms, Waldron, Cox, Carman, and Bender all contributing to the win.

### Women Drive to Perfect December
By Mike Anderson, Sports Editor

Coach John Filar likes to preach to his athletes about the importance of “spurts.” “We talk about how the game is built on spurts. And we really emphasize that there are points in the game you need to make a run.”

Perhaps, then, the month of December could be described as one really long, impressive spurt. Adam Duritz and the Counting Crows lament about the tormenting length of “a long December.” For the Lady ‘Cats, it was quite the contrary. They would have loved to see this December last forever.

The team went 7-0 from December 1 through January 4, overwhelming opponents by an average of greater than 20 points per game. The head coach describes this season as “the most fun yet.” Who can blame him?

After losing a difficult setback in the conference-opener against Chattanooga in late November, the Lady ‘Cats rebounded with decisive victories against UNC Charlotte, Bucknell, and East Carolina in the first week of December. And they were far from finished. Sparked by a smothering defensive intensity, the Lady ‘Cats notched consecutive victories against Sewanee, College of Charleston, East Tennessee State, and Western Carolina.

The team then sputtered in the last week of the winter vacation, dropping back-to-back games against Georgia Southern and UNC Greensboro, before bouncing back with victories over Furman and Appalachian State to better their conference record to 5-3. With that mark, the Wildcats find themselves in the thick of the conference hunt. They are now situated in a four-way tie for third place in the conference, just two games behind league-leading UNC Greensboro.

“I’m a little surprised at how competitive the conference is; there are seven teams right now in position to win the conference,” said Filar. “I’m excited right now, but I’m even more anxious to see where we’re gonna go. We want to bring a Southern Conference title here, we want a banner.”

Ali Ton Alpert ‘96 (a current employee of the New York Knicks organization). Congratulations, Ali!!finishing victorious. The rest of the season looks promising for the Wildcat wrestlers, hoping to improve from last year’s Southern Conference Tournament performance. There are two more home matches this year. The first one, on January 30 at 3 pm, matches Davidson against Norfolk State, and then Davidson faces Gardner Webb and Surry on February 6 at 1 pm.

The ‘Cat wrestlers have won 3 of their last 4 meets to improve to 4-6. "We really want the student body to come out to our games. We'd love to have them come sit behind our bench so we can hear them screaming. We need them to be that sixth player.” — Women’s Basketball Coach John Filar

Swimmers drowned out by competition

With their loss to the UNC Wilmington Seahawks, the Davidson swimming and diving teams may appear to have started the second half of their season on a bad note. However, the UNCW team was talented and deep, and the Wildcats' performance against them was Davidson’s best-ever showing against the Seahawks. The Wildcat men (3-7) fell by a mere 21 points. According to head coach Rich DeSelm, a Davidson victory was well within reach, but UNCW (6-4) was able to capitalize on the ‘Cats' lack of depth in the diving and sprinting events. “It (the meet) was bittersweet,” DeSelm said. “We pulled together and competed well, but no diving and depth in sprinting is our Achilles' heel.”

Despite the loss, several Davidson swimmers had outstanding performances. Freshman Graham Graveley won the 500 and 1000 yard freestyle events. Senior Michael McCabe triumphed in the 200 freestyle and took second in the 100 free, while sophomore Kurt Hirsekorn claimed second in the 200 yard individual medley and first place in the 200 breaststroke. Also, according to DeSelm, junior Sam Kuykendall’s times in the 200 butterfly and 200 backstroke are faster than at any point last year.

On the women’s side, the ‘Cats (4-7) encountered what DeSelm termed a “dynamic” UNCW team that stood at 6-2 and was undefeated at home. Although the final 139-92 indicates Seahawk command of the meet, DeSelm was pleased with the team’s performance. “We did the best we’ve ever done against them,” DeSelm said. “Each year we are encouraged.”

Individual standouts for the Lady ‘Cats included junior Rachel Horak, who had lifetime best times in both the 50 and 100 yard freestyles. Also, junior Mary Shell Brosche continued to succeed in her dual role as a team leader and an outstanding performer. Brosche claimed second in the 200 free, 200 individual medley, and 200 backstroke. Also, according to DeSelm, freshman Heidi Hester has continued to improve as the season progresses. Hester took third in the 500 freestyle with a time of 5:14.47.

After the tough competition from UNCW, the meet against N.C. A&T was a welcome change of pace. The ‘Cats utterly dominated their opponents, winning by an astounding 118 points. Davidson finished first, second, and third in nearly every event. With one month to go until the Southern States Championships, which the ‘Cats have won two years in a row, DeSelm is pleased with his team’s current progress. “We had our best trip (annual training trip in Ft. Lauderdale, FL) in six years,” DeSelm said. “We challenged them and they responded.”

As far as goals for the remainder of this season, DeSelm says he would like to see a drop in overall times and improvements in the diving events. On Friday at 3 pm, the men take on a talented Georgia Tech team, while both the men and women compete against a well-rounded College of Charleston squad on Saturday at 2 pm. Both meets are at home.
