In a story elsewhere in the paper the announcement is made that the YMCA social room will be open during
the Homecoming week-end, and that a Saturday “feed” will be held there in the afternoon for non-fraternity men and their
dates. Also, a letter from the Pan-Hellenic Council states this fact to be aware of the fact that the dances
are as much for non-fraternity men as for fraternity men. In past years non-fraternity men have attended Davidson dances in
good numbers, as they should, but too often they have felt that a date was more than could be handled
under the existing circumstances. The fraternities have always welcomed non-fraternity men in their houses on week-ends and at other times,
but it is understandable that these students have felt slightly out of place there.

DAY’S DIARY BY BILL LEMMON

There is not very much dope passing around this week as most of the BMOC’s such as Whiskey Bob Finley
are waiting for the dances to look over the crop for prospective “dates.” “One Punch Herbie” (The Hermit) Codington, of

TRUE AMERICANISM

Today, in a time of doubts and fears, of world strife and conflict, the flag-wavers have again risen. Since time
began there have been those who rush madly toward the sound of martial music with patriotic emotions flooding their shallow
breasts, while content to sit idly by during more peaceful times, doing nothing to help destroy the seeds of revolution
and war. It is a deplorable fact that Americans have too long let satisfaction with affairs as they are be
their theme. The average person, along with his neighbors, has cultivated this trait, until the great majority of our people
knew little about trends of the times, and cared less about national life, and the government. Since Europe has become
involved in a bloody battle, our nationalistic spirit has arisen several thousand per cent. Everywhere columnists, lecturers, politicians, and the
newspapers are pounding away at the need for preparedness, defense, isolation of the Western Hemisphere, and hundreds of other pet
ideas. It has come to the point where this is necessary, and because it is necessary, it is fortunate that
our citizenry is at least capable of partly arousing itself in time of national emergency.

But true Americanism is far more than the nationalistic shouts which must arise in time of crisis. Our real patriots
are those who have consistently worked for a better and more secure national life in peace as well as in
more troubled times. The few who have worked toward this end throughout the quiet years are more nearly representative of
true Americanism, than all those who now come forward to lend their hands and voices to national needs. Our peacetime
patriots—perhaps the man next door, perhaps the doctor, perhaps the minister, or the business man—are all but forgotten in the
wild rush toward nationalism brought on by fear of war. Our wartime patriots are, unfortunately, a necessity, but the true
spirit of the American is better displayed by him who has steadily and loyally given his best toward building a
sound national life. True Americanism is not that sporadic patriotism displayed in time of crisis, ready to die for one’s
country if need be, but rather it is that intelligent, deliberate, consistent giving of one’s best toward building a national
life wherein the inalienable rights of the citizen are assured.

As it has been for several reasons. While not many students will eventually go into the field of the stage
and dramatic productions, there is far more than direct training for these things to be gained from the presentation and
study of plays and stage productions. Acting offers a great opportunity to overcome such prevalent faults as self-consciousness, bad pronunciation,
nervousness, lack of poise and various other things. Any course or activity which can be used to remedy such habits
or bad features of a person’s makeup will naturally be of great service to him. Then too, dramatics, like all
other activities, is useful as a means of contact with other persons, a highly important phase of a well-rounded education.
Under the direction of Mr. Bringel, dramatics at Davidson should reach a new “high.” It has been hard for those
students interested in drama to accomplish much without some guiding hand to give expert advice and criticism. The faculty advisers
have worked hard and given their best, but obviously a man who has made a thorough study of the subject
and also has a well-grounded working knowledge can impart his ideas and criticism to others more clearly. Any activity which
goes forward, as dramatics now does, betters Davidson’s life. And extracurricular activities are a large part of her “life.” Therefore,
we wish good success to Mr. Bringel as he begins his work at Davidson, and congratulate the administration for securing
such a man.

ALMA MATER SITUATION

Last Friday Davidson’s student body voted not to adopt either of the two proposed Alma Maters, but to continue to
use “O Davidson” as such, and this decision came after due consideration by all concerned, since both songs were presented
three times during the chapel period. We will not be entirely satisfied with the Alma Mater situation until there is
a more suitable one than “O Davidson,” because we do not believe that song to be entirely suited to the
purpose. But it is well to know that some action has been taken after a much too long delay. Putting
it off did no good, and now at least we know where we stand—exactly where we started. The music department
is to be commended for working so hard to present these songs properly, even though neither failed to be selected.
The long delay in action was probably excusable, but it is much better to know that something definite has at
last been done.

subjects this, and will enjoy the Homecoming Dances with us. Each fraternity will maintain a sort of an open house
on the court all week-end, and non-fraternity men are invited to feel free to entertain their dates at any house.
All festivities on the court will be held very informally and we hope that everyone will come down to mingle
with the alumni. The “Y” social room will be open throughout the week-end also and there will be a feed
there Saturday afternoon for the boys and their dates. We are looking forward to another great Homecoming and feel sure
that everyone will help us make the dances a big success. Thanks, PAN-HELLENIC COUNCIL.

Compulsory Chapel

Dear Andy:

Last year several open forums were held in Phi Hall, with various points of discussion. One of these subjects was
compulsory chapel and church attendance. At this particular meeting a good many students offered various opinions concerning the matter, and
it seemed that everyone would like to see the present system changed. But nothing was done, mainly because no one
had any definite plan as of but no nothing comes of it because one will head the thing and solidify
the idea into action. Even a rejection of any plan that might be presented would be better than doing nothing
at all about it. Maybe I stand alone in this expressed opinion, and if this is true, I would like
to know about it. But if appearances are not deceiving, then I am backed up (spiritually at least) by about
six hundred other students. There is supposed to be a Student-Faculty Relations Committee to take up things such as this,
or maybe it doesn’t care to handle such a touchy subject. Maybe this has never been called to their attention.
Also, this would seem to fall within the limits of activity of ODK, who also may not have given the
matter any thought. At any rate, we think someone should consider the question carefully, with representation from both faculty and
student body. The situation as it exists today is highly unsatisfactory to the majority of the student body, and has
been for quite a while. Because someone with power over me might take this in the wrong way, as has
been done before in some cases, I remain,

Sincerely,
“SYSTEM CHANGER”

Film Report Card By DAVID VOSBURGH

Thursday, Oct. 24.

*** “Third Finger Left Hand”—Myrna Loy, Melvin Douglas, and Lee Bowman. This is the funniest show to be shown on
our screen in many a day. Myrna marries Melvin Douglas under adverse conditions and the entire marriage turned out very
badly. Her father wanted to have the whole thing called off but they soon break up. It is a very
good comedy and a show that should not be missed by those who want to get married but are afraid
of father-in-law.

Friday, Oct. 25.

*** “Too Many Girls”—Lucille Ball, Richard Carlson and Anne Miller. This is an interesting show that displays many beautiful girls
in a series of dances and good vaudeville acts. Richard Carlson gets along fine until he gets too many girls
on his list and has a hard time explaining to all of them about his love affairs. He is finally
caught and falls in love with beautiful Lucille Ball.

Saturday, Oct. 26

*** “The Quarterback”—Wayne Morris, Virginia Dale and Edgar Kennedy. Wayne Morris and Edgar Kennedy play the part of twins in
this really good football show. This is really a good football picture where good blocking and tackling is exhibited. Wayne
is the great hero and does everything wrong while his brother is a good boy and plays fair with everyone.
A love story is centered around Lillian Cornell and Virginia Dale. This is one of the better football pictures and

and as such is a better Davidson. Now that there will be a definite place where men who do not
belong to social fraternities can entertain their dates during the afternoons and before dances, it should follow that more of
these men will have girls up for the dances, and that more will attend the dances.

The YMCA is to be commended for seeing this need and meeting it, as is the Pan-Hellenic Council for helping
to put it across. Both organizations hope that every possible use will be made of the facilities, and that because
of them all involved will be profited.

Dear Andy:
We are writing to try to clear up a slight misunderstanding about our Davidson dances. These dances are for everyone—not
merely the members of the nine social fraternities on the campus—but every Davidson man. In spite of the fact that
non-fraternity men have no representation on the Pan-Hellenic Council, the dances are for them as well as the nine social
groups. We sincerely hope that they are aware of this.

Possibly nothing can be done, but we have tried. Like so many other times, ideas and opinions are alike, and
nothing has ever been done, to my knowledge, about it.

Bumbarger threatens to give some unfavorable propaganda in the Queen City. Bumbarger and Termite Mann seem to have made a
startling find. They are dating immediately after supper these nights in the Queen City.

Our noted song writer, Hite, has as his date for the Homecoming Pet Dargon of Winthrop, now that she promises
to bring him a nice big turkey neck—he says that “he ain’t had none.” The Clemson boys are sending a
delegation of farmers up to keep him straight on the weekend. Bud Ward and Termite Mann seem to have made
a startling find. They are dating immediately after supper these nights in the Queen City.

Hacky-Wacky (C. Hackney) had a date Sat. but could not work her until 3:28 on Sun, from which he was
very much flattered at having the opportunity of driving around the town before alighting at the all-famous “Del” where he
spent the night.
