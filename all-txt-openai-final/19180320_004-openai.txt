The following is an extract from a letter received from Robert W. Miles, '11, with the Army Y.M.C.A. in France,
notice of whose sailing appeared in The Davidsonian:

"Over here in France I am pleasantly located with plenty to do. My Y.M.C.A. consists of two rooms on the
second floor of the town hall in this little French town. I am the only secretary here and have a
great time, you may be sure. There is a medical detachment billeted downstairs and each day I have one man
detailed to help me. Everyone in the outfit, from the commanding officer down, is willing to help, so my duties
are rendered far easier on account of such whole-souled co-operation. My room is in the home of a French family
that does everything possible to make life pleasant for me. Really, it would be almost impossible for me to be
more pleasantly situated. The French do everything they can to make life pleasant for all the boys."

The following is also from a Davidsonian "over there," coming from Lex Kluttz, ex-'15, now with a hospital unit stationed
at "Z", France:

"I am anxiously waiting to receive the first issue of The Davidsonian I will receive in France. Joe Carlisle and
Capt. Walker Moore are all real well, and we are all working hard. We are getting along fine. Most of
us are temporarily Engineers building barracks, roads, etc. We were at Allentown, Pa., three months, then at Camp Mills, and
then across on the largest boat afloat. We made many stops after landing at various camps for just a short
time. Have had most interesting experiences. We are getting our hospital ready, which will be one of the largest and
most complete army hospitals in Europe."

**BOOKS FOR SOLDIERS TO BE COLLECTED FRIDAY**

The week beginning March 18 has been chosen by the American Library Association to solicit books to...add to the Libraries
of the training camps, and to send to France for the Y.M.C.A. stations. The college and the village made a
collection of about 200 volumes and 200 pamphlets to be sent to Paris Island in December, but only four or
five families in the village sent in books, so the community has made but little contribution. On Friday, the 22nd
inst., a house-to-house canvass will be made and any books suitable for young men will be gladly received. The collection
will be held at the Library until its destination is decided by the State Committee having the matter in charge.
Books that interest boys from 12 to 15 can be used for the foreigners who are just learning to read
English, but good new books—books that you have read, and which will simply lie on your book shelves in the
future—are asked for. Books about the war are eagerly sought by the soldiers, and biography, science, travel, fiction, poetry, etc.,
if of the type which the young man in your home would read, will be of great service.

Don't let your heart go pitter-pat when a young lady smiles at you. She probably has all she can do
to keep from laughing.
