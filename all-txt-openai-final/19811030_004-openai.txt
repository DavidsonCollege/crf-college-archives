The college brought in a team to evaluate the Career Office's Job Placement Program on Wednesday, 21 October. The team
consisted of the Director of Placement at UNC — Greensboro, Richard Harwood, and the Director of Personnel at First Union
Bank, David McClintock (’70).

Careers Office Director Ken Wood runs the Job Placement program and also provides Career Exploration and Experiential Learning programs.

In recognition of the fact that fewer Davidson students are entering graduate school immediately but are, instead, entering the job
market, SGA Corporate Relations Committee (CRC) chairman Stuart Dorsett commented, “...in the past there hasn’t been much emphasis on placement
and as a result a lot of students feel the Placement Program is deficient.” According to a Davidsonian survey last
spring, 50 percent of the senior class planned to go to graduate school this year, and 33 percent planned to
go directly on to a job.

College President Samuel Spencer, Dean of Students Will Terry, and the Trustee Student Life Committee were also responsible for the
evaluation.

Mr. Wood sees the evaluation as “a response to some members of the Trustees who feel that we should have
a more full-blown traditional placement program.”

Dean Terry declined to name any specific Trustees who requested the evaluation and said that the “SGA as much as
any” made the request.

**The committee’s evaluation**

In evaluating the Placement Program, Mr. McClintock and Mr. Harwood examined Placement Program material from Mr. Wood’s office, talked with
Mr. Wood and his secretary, Susie Summers, met with a group of students in the Job Placement Program, and met
with SGA President Chip Legerton and Stuart. At the Trustee meeting Friday, 23 October, Dean Terry offered a summary of
the evaluation. He reports a need to consider “increasing the number of companies coming to campus and the variety of
companies coming to campus.”

The evaluation team will submit their recommendations to Dean Terry next week. He will pass them on to President Spencer.
The CRC has proposed that the college hire additional personnel, specifically a qualified individual in the job placement phase of
the Careers Office. As of 14 January 1981, the Careers Office had contacted “about eighty newly selected corporations in an
attempt to work with the SGA towards recruiting corporate recruiters.” Mr. Wood was able to attract two of these companies
to recruit at Davidson.

**The recruitment problem**

Companies that did not agree to send recruiters to the college told Mr. Wood that sending recruiters to Davidson is
not cost-effective in comparison to the large universities, and that there have been “hiring cut-backs in the kind of jobs
that have traditionally been filled by people from the liberal arts.” Mr. Wood said the companies also told him that
since, “unlike many other liberal arts colleges, Davidson has limited business courses and limited computer courses,” their recruiting efforts are
hampered, and many companies are in “a hold-position in respect to new hires due to the local economy.”

Dean Terry also said that the evaluation team’s response to the Experiential Program was “exceedingly positive.”

Stuart Dorsett’s meeting with the Trustee Student Life Committee, chaired by Mr. James Dorsett, focused on answering questions about the
CRC’s survey of 64 of last year’s seniors who went through the Placement Program. Stuart said more than 80 percent
responded, but that they showed “a lack of positive response.”

Dean Terry describes the Job Placement Program as a “brokerage operation by which a corporation with a need could be
matched with a prospective student employee that had the skills and ability to do the job.” Interviewed on the day
of the evaluation, Mr. Wood said, “I think we need to be clear about whose responsibility it is to get
a job.” He added, “It seems to me that our major task is to work with students as they equip
themselves for managing the job hunt themselves.”

Stuart formed the CRC during the spring of ’81 to associate the Placement Program with Corporate Development, which attracts company
financial support for the College.

Ken Wood explained his program’s philosophy saying, “It’s a difficult thing for students to see that there’s a relationship between
learning and living. Education is not off here in a bag somewhere and my life is over here. It seems
to me that while we’re in school some attention needs to be paid to ‘Who am I?’ ‘Where am I
going with my life?’ and that our program is uniquely designed to deal with those questions and to support students
as they engage in that kind of inquiry and activity.”

The present list of companies scheduled to recruit on campus includes: Xerox Corporation, two military services, Wachovia Bank and Trust,
and Bojangles.
