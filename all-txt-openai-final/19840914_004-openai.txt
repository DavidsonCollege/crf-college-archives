“I'll be seeing Germany a way no tourist can. From the cockpit of an Army Chinook helicopter.

“I’m being assigned to a Chinook helicopter unit in Germany as a test pilot and maintenance officer, and I’m proud
that I'll be the first woman to have that assignment over there. It's a real thrill for me.

“So was learning how to fly a helicopter. It takes a lot more skill than an airplane. If you think
college is demanding, flight school is even tougher. It's not only academically demanding, it’s really mentally demanding as well as
physically.

“In Germany, I'll have a chance to use some of the leadership and management techniques I learned in ROTC. It’s
going to be a real challenge having command responsibilities.
