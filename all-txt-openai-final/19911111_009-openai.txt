**Commons Serves Uncommon Food**

For the past couple of weeks, I have been wondering where on earth the Vail Commons finds its recipes. Don’t get me wrong, I really appreciate the fine cuisine this establishment offers Davidson students. Seriously, you should sample the Frosted Flakes—I promise that they’re really good. Sometimes, however, I am at a loss when considering the marvelous array of different dishes which are offered.

Take last week, for example. I have a vague suspicion that the Commons was attempting to be culturally diverse, like most other establishments on campus. We were offered a variety of different dishes from each corner of the world. Mexican night saw the best refried beans this side of Oaxaca. The Tahitian dish was particularly fascinating. I had no idea that cornflake-coated chicken could possibly taste so good. I have similar sentiments about the Greek Gyro. Most interesting: my roommate is still recovering.

### Who Can Save Mother Nature?

#### By Jim Weaver

So maybe you’re not overwhelmed with gobs of money, wanting to distribute it equally to the charities of your choice. You will be one day, God willing. Coincidentally, there’s an earth out there which just might need to be saved, and plenty of organizations saying they’ll do it if you just give them some sort of donation. How do you, the discriminating philanthropist, decide who gets what?

Outside Magazine, recognizing this altruistic angst, recently compiled a list of the top 25 environmental groups. Each group is profiled on the grounds of its bureaucracy, financial situation, and effectiveness. What follows are profile summaries for the organizations in which students here would most likely be interested.

**Greenpeace U.S.A.** legitimately leads the pack in popularity. The management is surprisingly non-corrupt, considering their budget ranks fourth highest among the 25 groups rated. Greenpeace uses their healthy resources to actively cause environmental awareness by pulling stunts that will land them on the news. Yes, these are the people who block boats’ paths and too often get rammed by said boats, but they’ve been instrumental in spreading the environmental message. Address: 1436 U Street NW, Washington, DC 20009.

**Earth First!** has built a reputation for its totally uncompromising philosophy. A self-proclaimed monkey wrench gang, members pour sand in bulldozer gas tanks, hold Puke-Ins at shopping malls, and until recently they spiked trees. They also get infiltrated by the FBI, and they often get arrested. Earth First! is poor, too, with a budget of approximately $150,000. A donation to Earth First! would not be squandered by any corrupt executive; it would be used to defend the earth by any means possible. Address: Box 5871, Tucson, AZ 85703.

**Ducks Unlimited**, besides having groovy decals, has preserved over 200,000 acres of wetlands since 1984. Why? To save ducks. To shoot. They’re hunters. They’re also saving a lot of land. With a budget of $67.4 million, they’ve restored migration routes in California, opened an office in Washington to develop waterfowl management plans, as well as to protect that land. Essentially, they’re effective environmentalists who hate being called environmentalists. Address: One Waterfowl Way, Long Grove, IL 60047.

**Sierra Club** has maintained itself as a group of political realists. Its lobbyists can be found on the state and local level. Its members have “maneuvered green candidates into congressional seats,” and were prime movers of the Clean Air Act. Their realism keeps them from being too radical, though they are more so than any of the other mainline groups. Address: 730 Polk Street, San Francisco, CA 94109. (An offshoot group, Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, puts less faith in politics, compromising less.)

**The Nature Conservancy** buys things. They’re loaded, and this gives them the liberty to buy land and protect “more than 1,600 private nature preserves nationwide.” The majority of their income “comes from holding land for and selling land to the government.” In reality, they don’t need college students’ money.

**National Wildlife Federation** doesn’t come off too well: the CEO maintains a $200,000 salary, and they’ve been known to sell donated land, intended for nature preserves, to developers. “Ranger Rick” is their main contribution.

Though environmental groups depend on our support to be effective on a grand level, our own donations of time and effort are equally, if not more, effective in helping our environment. Methods need not be detailed here; we’re all fairly familiar with them. Still, to be wholly effective requires support of large, active groups. If you would like to learn more about these organizations or about what you can do to help, or if you have suggestions, join us on Wednesday, November 13, at 9 pm in the Union for the next Environmental Action Group Meeting. Choose wisely.

### Frosh International Quiz Results

#### By Jennifer Reid

Recently, student-faculty teams representing the Dean Rusk Program returned this year’s International Awareness Tests to freshmen. These tests were comprised of 25 general fill-in-the-blanks, 10 associations of leaders...to their respective countries, and 15 identifications of countries on a world map, all to be answered in 20 minutes. Statistics compiled by Dr. Hansford Epes indicated that the mean score for the full test was 55.50—an increase of about five points from last year’s average. The range of scores, from 12 to 100, included only the second perfect score in ten years. Questions dealing with the population of the United States and the world seemed to present difficulty and were answered correctly by 22 percent and 26 percent of the class, respectively. About one of every 15 freshmen identified Pearl Harbor as being located in Japan, and only 43 percent gave the correct date for the bombing of Hiroshima. Students were a bit more successful on the map portion of the test with a mean score of 66.41. Scores on these tests, though, are not noted on individual records, and the results are primarily for statistical analyses of the international awareness of incoming freshmen. Ambassador Jack Perry, in a meeting with Second East Belk, stressed the importance of international awareness and suggested that students pursue opportunities through the Dean Rusk program, study abroad office, and acquaintances with international students here at Davidson. These tests are intended to be an indication of prior knowledge and an encouragement to take advantage of opportunities to become more worldly aware. Test yourself with the sample quiz on page 12!

One must, however, give credit when due. The vegetarian dishes are not only tasty, but also show a great deal of creativity. The Baked Cheese Grits are simply awesome, and I feel obliged to mention the wonderful Spinach-Cheese casserole that we ate last Wednesday. I had no idea that cold vegetables mixed with even colder cheese could possibly taste so good. Maybe it was the subtle seasoning that just made that extra-special difference. Finally, however, I think the prize for haute cuisine must be given to those wonderful cooked breakfasts served daily. There is nothing I appreciate more than a plate of greasy sausage and congealed oatmeal on a Monday morning before my 8:30. It really makes my week—makes me feel good about another week of classes at Davidson. But it confuses me that I see so many people at the Union for breakfast and lunch. Poor fools... they obviously have no idea what they are missing.

Barkley Returns To A Different Davidson
By Virginia Mischen

Sometimes the Davidson experience affects a graduate so much that he or she will seize the opportunity to return to our fold. Such an alumnus is Dr. Karl “Skip” Barkley, Class of 1979. His return is a valuable addition to the college and the larger community. Dr. Barkley can simultaneously wear several different hats. His reason for returning to Davidson several months ago was to practice family medicine at the Davidson Clinic, but he said that the chance to become involved in campus life also factored in his decision. Many students may know him as the new Director of Student Health or as a team physician with the athletic department. He comes to us straight from a sports medicine fellowship in Columbus, Georgia, where he worked at an orthopedic clinic and served as a team doctor for the Auburn University basketball and football teams.

His interest in sports medicine reflects a personal love of athletics which led him to compete on the swim team all four years of his Davidson career. He claims that he was no team star, but his commitment was obviously deep, as evidenced by a tale he told of once swimming in two meets in the middle of exams. As a team doctor, Barkley covers many sports events and works closely with the athletic trainers. His main responsibility is deciding when injured athletes are ready to participate, but he also uses his orthopedic background to evaluate cases that would otherwise be sent to Charlotte. Barkley and several other doctors at the Davidson Clinic take turns visiting the infirmary on a daily basis. There, they review charts, answer student questions, and consult with Karren Donald, the Physician’s Assistant. If necessary, they will intercede in more serious cases. In addition, one doctor is always on call after infirmary hours.

As director, Dr. Barkley coordinates the activities of the Student Health Center. He likes his contact with the students, but says that they get too stressed, a factor he feels contributes to many of the health problems on campus. When asked how it feels to be back in Davidson, Barkley replied that it is difficult not to have flashbacks to his own college days. He jokingly bemoaned the fact that he is now a “townie” and said that he has enjoyed seeing a side of the Davidson community which he never knew as a student. Currently, he is waiting to move into a house in town where he will live with his wife and two-year-old daughter.
