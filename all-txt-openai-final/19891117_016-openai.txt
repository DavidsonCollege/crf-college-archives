THANKSGIVING BREAK BEGINS—HAVE A SAFE AND WONDERFUL HOLIDAY

PAX, from page 14

Both personally believe that the coed environment helps. I love coming down at noon expecting the plain old pasta salad
I planned for lunch and finding instead that Roz has dyed the pasta swirls blue, orange, green, yellow, and red,
just for fun. And then seeing the expressions on everyone's faces as they peer into the bowl. Some look befuddled;
some laugh; some look satisfied and nod their heads.

Every house has its own idiosyncrasies, its own jokes, its own personalities. But I've never seen a house with as
many of all of them as PAX. PAX membership is an experience in itself; I can’t really convey “the PAX.”
The feelings, the friends, the situations are what make it special.
