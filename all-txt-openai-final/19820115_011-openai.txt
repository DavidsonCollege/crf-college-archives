Sitting in the old plot
Damn snack bar—

Where we all pool together

Gnawing at ourselves to eat another's heart—

Will Wills unite?
Will Life find us?
Will time see us this mercy
Before death finds us apart?

A deep dark blabber
Talk, idiots talk
Walk, wall, talk
Girls walking in their slandered flesh
Boys, talking of their balls
And reciting Aristotle,
To prepare them;

So we can all talk in terse agreement

We're strangers

(Although we've never met eyes)

We'll talk the same

Of what we already know

And bottle it with coarse laughter

(to prove we both feel)

We laugh, yes, yes, to say
“Please! We do agree, don’t we!”
And shift silently apart.
People come and people go...

(although we don’t, we say we do

And never really come at all)

We weep inside and never
Leave our fate behind—

Just drag it—

In this Snack-Bar

In this pool, we'll keep trying to be free,

Alone

So we can let the wave of time

Rub us sweetly into the breast of nothingness

And die with these shells still intact—
A not-so-fragile, lifeless death.

Bret Logan 83

Free from my love for you and your love for me
