The Davidson women’s soccer team followed up their season-opening victory over High Point with another high-scoring win over UNC Asheville. Wednesday night’s 7-2 victory in Richardson Stadium gave Davidson’s faithful and boisterous crowd an entertaining show.Tournament in the finale against UNC Wilmington. Jennifer Ortega amazed the crowd with her efficient attacks, batting down 10 kills in just 17 attempts without an error. Freshman Nicole Tonelli got the start at setter and did a superb job, handing out 34 assists while mixing in six kills of her own without an error in 12 attempts. Sophomore Kaitlyn Martin led the ‘Cats defensively with 14 digs. For the match, the Wildcats hit .340 while holding the Seahawks to a mere .030. Heather White led UNCW with seven kills. Three Yellow Jacket players were named to the all-tournament team — juniors Maja Pachale and Ekeleida Mabry, along with freshman setter Kele Eveland. Pachale was nearly unstoppable in the tournament with a whopping .441 attack percentage. Leading Georgia Tech in kills with 29 was Mabry, and Eveland did a little of everything, dishing out 95 assists, scooping out 23 digs, and putting away nine kills, not to mention her six block assists. Davidson placed two players on the team with Ortega and junior Erica Schwartz. Ortega had a monster day on Saturday, leading the ‘Cats in kills for both matches with 14 and 10, respectively. To top those off, she only committed two errors for an incredible .537 percentage on the day. Schwartz had 72 assists in the first two matches of the tournament as the team’s setter. Georgia State placed senior Jill Thieneman on the all-tournament team as she amassed a team-high 24 kills over the three matches. “I was very pleased with the way we played the entire tournament,” said Head Coach Tami Darwin, “but particularly in the second match to Georgia Tech. We battled them every point and ended up with a great deal of experience against a very good team. Playing those types of opponents will only help make us better and prepare us for the Southern Conference schedule.”

Despite the light rain which fell for much of the game, the Wildcats got off to a fast start by scoring three goals early in the first half. Sophomore Heather Maloney gave Davidson its first goal in the fifteenth minute of play. Two more Wildcat goals in the next three minutes of play basically put the Bulldogs away. Freshman Leigh Anne Hopkins tallied the first of her three goals in the 16th minute off an assist from Heather Maloney. Carolyn Stumpf netted the third goal of the game in the 18th minute to put the ‘Cats up 3-0. UNC Asheville closed the lead to 3-2 in the 68th minute as Megan Harris scored an unassisted goal. While their second goal gave new hope to the Asheville women, the dominating play of the Wildcats continued to frustrate the tiring Bulldogs. This fatigue resulted in more physical play from both teams. The second half saw a total of 24 fouls, double that of the first half. The Wildcats were able to fight through the rough play and finish off the Bulldogs. Freshman Catie Williams increased the lead to 4-2 when she scored her first collegiate goal off a great pass from Stumpf in the 70th minute. From there, the Wildcats finished off the Bulldogs with three goals in the final ten minutes: one more by Heather Maloney and two by Hopkins, who completed a hat trick. “This was definitely a team win tonight,” said Hoskins, who ended the game with three goals. From the coach’s perspective, Davidson’s failure to finish off the Bulldogs early in the game gave Coach Hundley a little concern, but he was nonetheless pleased with how the team played. The team was “strong on defense in the second half,” commented an encouraged Hundley. With eleven goals in their first two games, the offense is definitely off to a strong start, and with a defensive unit becoming more cohesive as the season progresses, it appears that the Davidson women’s soccer team will be a force this year in the Southern Conference.
