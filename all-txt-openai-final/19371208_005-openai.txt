Journalism Class Gathers Information on Workings of Newspaper

The class, under the leadership of Fred Smith, alumni secretary, made its first trip last weekend to Charlotte as the guests of The Charlotte Observer. The class arrived at Charlotte at ten o’clock Friday night and for three hours watched the methods used by the daily newspaper. 

Under the guidance of Mr. Ernest B. Hunter in the editorial department, they were shown through the plant. The first place visited was the Associated Press bureau, where they observed the process of gathering news stories. Mr. Hunter then took them through the editorial section.
