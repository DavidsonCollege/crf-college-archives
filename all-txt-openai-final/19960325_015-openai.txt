### The Sports Authority: Tyson Returns
By David Mortlock, Staff Writer

Iron Mike Tyson is a very scary human being. His massive arms are scary. His huge chest is scary. Even the gaps between his teeth are scary. But scary human beings are fun to watch. Just ask the 1.4 million pay-per-viewers who witnessed Iron Mike’s masterful TKO of Frank Bruno two weekends ago. In the blink of an eye, heavyweight boxing is back.

But it wasn’t the blood or the gore that people missed during Tyson’s absence. And it wasn’t massive arms or huge chests, twelve-round wars or three-round battles. Because all these things were always present. People missed Mike Tyson. They missed his flamboyance, domination, and 54-second massacres. They missed his anger. Boxing fans wanted a glimpse of Tyson, the big, bad killing machine. And they got what they had hoped.

Tyson danced around Bruno, landing one vicious punch after another. Finally, in the third round, the referee stopped the lopsided fight, declaring Tyson the heavyweight champion of the world.

But the irony amazed me. Even though Tyson was able to raise his arms in the end, he wasn’t the real winner. The real winners were the 1.4 million people who turned off their televisions and Tyson until his next bout. The flamboyance was back. The domination was back. The anger was back. Iron Mike, champion killing machine, was back. And that is all anyone cared about.

Earlier this year when Tyson left prison, no one cared if he got home safely. Everyone wanted to know if he was going to fight again. Everyone wanted to see the anger again. It was all very selfish.

For Tyson, leaving prison meant reentering the life that put him away originally. For Iron Mike, life is a double-edged sword. He could stop fighting and go back to the streets. Or he could fight, make money, and continue to live an angry, unfulfilled, and brutally lonely existence.

Has anyone recommended that Tyson get a college degree? Has anyone recommended anything useful that might lead Tyson away from the boxing world? Not likely. When big, bad, and scary Iron Mike isn’t big, bad, and scary anymore, watch and see who sticks around. I'll bet it's not going to be the 1.4 million who love to see him fight, not the television producers, not his trainers, not his girlfriends, and certainly not his promoter Don King. Who else is left?

### Wildcat Roundup
**Men's Tennis**

A slow start in doubles play and an injury to co-captain Bill Mitchem proved too much to overcome, as the Wildcats fell 5-2 to App. St.

“It was a disappointing day for the team, but as of right now it is ancient history,” coach Jeff Frank said. Jon Pastel and Eric Bourn provided the only two Wildcat wins.

“It was a tough loss,” said Bourn, “We were in a position to win every match, but we just didn’t deliver.”

“I hate losing more than anything,” Judson Sutherland said, “But we have to go on. The matches don’t get any easier, but that’s Southern Conference tennis.”

Earlier in the week, Davidson avenged last year’s loss to Wofford, beating the Terriers, 5-2. The most interesting part of the match occurred when Pastel’s crafty gamesmanship drove Fred Jayet, Wofford’s #1 player, into unsportsmanlike antics and a match default.

“I just wanted to play,” Pastel said, “I wish we could have finished the match.”

**Women’s Tennis**

Davidson bettered its record to 8-4 this week, dispatching Elon, 7-0, and outlasting Winthrop, 5-4. After beating Elon, Winthrop provided stiffer competition, as the Wildcats dropped two of the three doubles matches, only to capture four of six singles encounters. Amber Bradford clinched the victory with a win at #2 singles. Tri-captain Ashley Maner sprained her ankle while down 3-5 in the third set of her #3 singles effort. She will hope-fully return against Tennessee-Chattanooga on Saturday. “The win against Winthrop was a milestone for the team,” said head coach Caroline Price, “Everyone pulled together to come up with those four singles victories and win it for Davidson.” -Kirstyn Leuner

This week, the women’s lacrosse team spent time practicing for a tournament at Vanderbilt next weekend. They were expecting to play this weekend, but Saturday’s game against Georgetown was cancelled due to a Georgetown conflict. The Wildcats (1-2) look to perform well next weekend, where they will face Stanford on Saturday and Vanderbilt on Sunday. -Dan Motz

Rugby
The rugby squad tasted defeat for the first time this season on Saturday, falling to powerful App. St., 27-6. “They were bigger, stronger, and faster, but we never gave up,” said club president Thayer Long, “We made them earn everything they got.” Penalty kicks brought the halftime score to 10-6. However, the Mountaineers outquicked the Wildcat defense down the sideline for second period scores, as App. St. won going away. Davidson captain Bob Yarborough contributed hard-fought runs, while Chris Williams and Keith Davis starred defensively. -Will Baldwin

Women’s Track
Several school records fell as the Women’s Track team had a good day at the Wake Forest Invitational in Winston-Salem this Saturday. The 4x100m relay team of Roxanne Formey, Laura Burkholder, Jamilah Sawyer, and Venessa Sims set a new Davidson standard with a time of 51.77, and Sawyer also broke a record by running a 15.4 in the 100m hurdles to take 6th place. “I felt pretty good about it (her hurdles race),” Sawyer said. “I want to get back down to where I’m used to running in the 14’s, but I’m improving.” In addition, Venessa Sims cleared 5’ 4 1/4” in the high jump to place 5th, and Laura Burkholder also grabbed a 5th place in long jump by soaring 17’ 6 1/4”. “We're very supportive as a team. We cheer for each other, and after a race we hug each other and say good job. We really make a point to do that, and that’s really important,” Sawyer continued. -Will Bradshaw

The men’s track team has been performing well in their outdoor season as they gear towards the conference finals on April 19-20 at East Tenn. St. The team was in Winston-Salem this weekend at the Wake Forest Invitational. “Overall we have made some improvements,” Head coach Gary Andrew said. “We have got to start being more consistent.” The 4x400 relay team of Dan Dearing, John Leslie, Karim Lawrence, and Mike Albert turned in what Andrew called “probably the best effort of the meet,” running a 3:31.3. In addition, Josh Cookson turned in a personal record 15:36 in the 5K; Tim O’Keefe also had a personal record, running 10:25 in the 3000m steeplechase. Andrew stressed the youth of the team as a future strength, mentioning that most of the runners (including O'Keefe, Cookson, Dearing, Lawrence, Albert, and Leslie) were freshmen or sophomores. -Will Bradshaw
