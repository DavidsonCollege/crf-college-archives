Alumni of Two Classes Will Gather in Reunion
Classes of 1887 and 1892 to Hold Reunion

Following out efforts to assist the alumni secretary in shaping his mailing list incident to publicity which will be sent alumni before commencement, The Davidsonian is printing the names and addresses of the members of the classes of 1887 and 1892, which are scheduled to reunite in June. The same request goes with these two lists that went with the former ones, that is, if anyone can assist the secretary in corrections, they are asked to communicate with him immediately.

Personal
Mayor J. H. Cook, '16, of Fayetteville, N. C., is unopposed for re-election this spring. His candidacy has not been announced, but he is expected to succeed himself.

C. A. Cannon, '15, of Concord, N. C., has been added to the board of directors of the Piedmont & Northern Railroad, which is a distinctive honor to a Davidson alumnus. He is already connected with numerous concerns.

W. H. Neal, ’17, of Charlotte, was married to Miss Jeannette Archer, daughter of Dr. and Mrs. I. J. Archer, of Montreat, N. C., on March 9th.

After April 1st, L. M. Currie, '18, will be located at 1262 Lakeland Avenue, Lakewood, Ohio. He has been in Cleveland since last September. Mr. Currie will be remembered as a former professor of physics at Davidson College.

That notable results accrue from a correct mailing list has been revealed by two checks for $25 each, which were recently received by the alumni secretary from alumni whose addresses were obtained recently. Dr. Rowan sent a letter to alumni on March 16th, stating that it was the last attempt to finance this work through letter. An alumnus in correspondence received and enclosed a check for the amount.

Some of the most interested men in Davidson today are those who attended the North Carolina Medical College during its existence at Davidson. These students took a few courses at Davidson and consider themselves as alumni of this institution. The secretary is making an effort to obtain the addresses of all these men, and if anyone knows of a doctor who was a student of the N. C. M. C., he would appreciate their names.

The president of the Greensboro Alumni Association is actively working, voluntarily sending out letters to alumni in his city in reference to any matter they will be interested in. His recent communication about the Davidson College Loyalty League was responsible for $67 from eight alumni.

Dr. Gammon to Conduct Spring Services for ‘Y’
Dr. E. G. Gammon, Pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Selma, Ala., will come to Davidson the second week of April. He will conduct a series of services beginning Sunday morning, the thirteenth, and continuing through Wednesday. These services will include the life-work talks, given every year at the conclusion of the talks sponsored by the Vocational Guidance Institute. These talks, given by leading professional men of different vocations, have been very helpful and instructive in helping the students to choose their life-work. The services of Dr. Gammon will come as a fitting close to the vocational talks.

As a graduate, Dr. Gammon took athletics. He played quarterback on the Varsity football team and held the position of shortstop on the baseball nine. After graduating from Hampden-Sydney, he remained there as pastor for some years. He has always taken a very keen interest in young people and has been a faculty member on several young people’s conferences. Last summer he was chaplain at the Black Bear Camp for boys. Because of his extensive work with young men, Dr. Gammon is widely known, popular, and his coming is anticipated with genuine interest.

Norfolk wrote that it was the first he had above. Many of the medical Guards at Charlotte will hold their annual meeting. Maj.-Gen. Malin Kraig, Brig.-Gen. J. B. Meets, Adjutant General of North Carolina; Brigadier General Dozier, Adjutant General of South Carolina, will be present.

On Monday afternoon, April 4th, a delegation of visitors will come to the inspection of the Carolina Medical College during its annual review.
