THE DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 28, 1927

Bases: Wake Forest 10, Davidson 6; hit by pitched ball: by Meadors (Hampton, Miller), by McInnis (Wickers); umpire: Hengeveld.

Last Wednesday, April 20, the Davidson Fresh defeated the Wake Forest Fresh nine, 6 to 3. The game was exceptionally well played and a fast one. The pitching and hitting of the rival hurlers featured the contest. McInnis, of Davidson, got two hits out of three times up, while Meadors, the visiting moundsman, equaled this feat. Mac struck out 10 batters, Meadors fanned seven. Miller and McConnell did some excellent fielding for Davidson. Davidson got 8 hits to the Baby Deacons’ 6. The errors were equally divided, both having four. The box score follows:

Fresh Tennis Team Plans for Matches

It was decided this spring that the most logical and fair way to pick the Freshman tennis team was by running off a tournament, so this was accordingly done. All men who cared to enter were eligible, no matter how they came out in the fall tournament, except that those who showed up best were seeded. The team is composed of the four men who reached the semi-finals. The winner plays No. 1 position, runner-up No. 2, while the other semi-finalists played a match to determine who should have the third and fourth places. The tournament was played in as short time as possible and there was a great deal of keen competition as well as several upsets before it closed. 

As the winner, Frontis Johnston plays No. 1, Albert Halverstadt No. 2, Ham Pettus No. 3, and DeCamp No. 4. Pettus and DeCamp proved to be the dark horses, each of whom played fine tennis and won out over men who were expected to make the team. Other men who showed up exceptionally well are White, Elliot, Henderson, Matthews, and Gardner. In order that these men may still have a chance to make the team, this challenge system has been decided upon: the above men will play off a tournament among themselves. The winner will be known as No. 5 and anyone else who thinks he has a chance to make the team may play one match with No. 5. When there are no more challenges, the man who holds No. 5 position can play a match with No. 4 for his place. If he is defeated, he keeps his place as No. 5. In case some member of the team...
