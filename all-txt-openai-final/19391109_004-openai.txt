**CATS HIT WIN COLUMN**

After six weeks of fruitless campaigning, the Cats finally hit the victory trail last week against The Citadel, a team that has likewise had a meager year, and a team that is in Davidson’s class. Against stronger rivals, the Wildcats have shown flashes and have displayed plenty of fight, but it remained for a rainy, cold day to bring out their latent abilities against the Cadets. Presenting a team that clicked at intervals to score two six-pointers, the Charleston boys were beaten by a Davidson team that showed its power and ability against an evenly matched opponent. The line had those holes open, and Sharpe ran better than he has done all season. Jay Bolin, too, showed power through the line, as did the other backs, who showed that they could go if given half a chance.

This weekend brings the present season well toward the end, with Carolina, Erskine, and Wake Forest booked. Football followers already predict two losses there, as Davidson meets the high-flying Tar Heels and Wake Forest’s powerful offense. Erskine should be a Davidson day again this year. Carolina will present such brilliant stars as Stirnweiss and Lalanne, who have led the way to an undefeated season thus far, and a last-minute stand against Tulane that brought a tie. The Tar Heels are, and have been, looking forward to Nov. 18, when they meet the Duke Blue Devils in the decisive Conference game, and will enter the field Saturday as a dress rehearsal for this bout. However, last year the Tar Heels were good, too, and it took them a mighty long time to get going as Davidson monopolized play during the first half. Then reserve power turned the tables, as it has done before, and U.N.C. forged ahead. This week the Cats know what they are up against and are out again to play against a heavier, larger squad, a team that ranks as one of the powers in the South, and a team that has yet to be beaten. A wild dreamer would hardly say that Davidson will beat the Heels, but fans can expect the usual variety of fight and hard play right up to the finish at Winston-Salem. And while Carolina is expected to win, they will have to play ball to do so and cannot be content to sit on their laurels of the past if they want to beat the Wildcats, who will shoot the works all the way.

**INTRAMURAL BASKETBALL STARTS**

Touch football came to an end last week after an interesting and tightly contested season. Some complaints were heard about the rapidity with which the round-robin affair was run off, as many teams played as many as four games in a row on successive days. However, we believe that this will be offset by the fact that the dormitory and fraternity basketball games will be played in the afternoons, and that there will be plenty of time for the games to be run off, at least up until the very end of the season. Last year, and in previous years, there has been a grand mix-up as intramural teams played at night after the varsity and frosh stopped practice. Handicapped by lack of adequate floor space in the small gym, the winter intramural program has always been a weak point. This year, however, most of the games will be played during the remainder of the football season when the court will be relatively vacant. Because of this, interest in basketball as an intramural sport should be heightened, and more benefit should be derived from it by all contestants. But this still leaves a question as to what sort of intramural activities will go on during the dead of winter, when outdoor games are necessarily few and far between, and when the basketball teams will be using the gym regularly. Badminton and wrestling offer only temporary respite. After they are over, or until they are run off, what will be offered to the students? Coach Whittle has done a fine job with the meager facilities available, but the main need is still a new gym, both for the varsity, freshmen, and intramural teams. Building funds are always slow to materialize, but it is our hope that before many years a new and larger gymnasium will take the place of the present outdated and cramped one.

**U.N.C., Duke, Clemson Hold Conference Lead**

For the fourth straight week, Carolina, Clemson, and Duke's defending titleholders continued to lead the Southern Conference championship race. Carolina’s undefeated Tar Heels chalked up their fourth loop win last week by downing State’s Wolfpack 17 to 0 in a driving rain. The Tar Heels reversed their usual procedure by flashing their powerful passing attack in the early moments of the game to score all of their points.

**Cats Meet Heels**

The Tar Heels engage Davidson’s Wildcats this week on a neutral gridiron at Winston-Salem in their final tune-up test before the important game with Duke on Nov. 18. The Cats won their first loop victory last week, walloping Citadel 22 to 14. Duke's Blue Devils, after nosing out Georgia Tech last week in Atlanta by a score of 7 to 6, continue to hold the conference lead.

**Varsity Engages Undefeated Tar Heels In Conference Battle**

Davidson’s Wildcats, after their excellent showing Homecoming Day in downing The Citadel, journey to Winston-Salem this Saturday to take on the powerful Tar Heels from North Carolina. The rejuvenated Wildcats, who defeated the valiant and hard-fighting Light Brigade and won their first game of the season, promise to offer the Southern Conference leaders a battle all the way. Many of the injuries sustained in the last few weeks of play seemed to have been completely healed and the Melvermen will be near the peak of condition when they face their rivals.

**Carolina’s Record**

The sound of Heel voices has attracted nationwide attention, scoring impressive victories over Citadel, Wake Forest, Virginia Tech, N.Y.U., and North Carolina State. The boys from Chapel Hill have not suffered a loss, and tied Pennsylvania this year. Carolina, while undefeated, has combined a remarkable aerial attack with a better-than-fair ground offense. The Heels have chalked up four conference victories against no defeats and have scored several intersectional wins over unquestionably strong opponents. The running and passing of Carolina’s two quarterbacks, “General” George Stirnweiss and Jim “Sweet” Lalanne, have received attention and praise from some of the foremost critics of the game. Only two of last year’s regulars were lost by graduation and essentially the same team will face the Wildcats again this year.

**Frosh Beaten By Lees-McRae**

Lees McRae barely nosed out the Freshman Cross Country team last Saturday morning in a Tri-Meet, which was the third contender. Lees McRae managed to chalk up 27 points to win, followed by Davidson with 33 and Greensboro Hi with 72. Greensboro was the third contender. Robinson, of Lees McRae, covered the 2.2-mile course in 10 minutes and 14.5 seconds to take first place. Nimmons, the number one man of the Frosh team, trailed Robinson to win second place, followed by Blanton of Lees McRae and Parks of Davidson in third and fourth places respectively. Webb (LM) placed fifth ahead of Royal (G), Nickels (D), Wilson (LM), Tarleton (D), Dresses (LM), Smith (D), McNeely (LM), and McNeil (D) in twelfth place. Land (D), Kuykendall (G), Munn (G), Beaman (G), and Johnson (G) followed.and townspeople of Davidson, when in Charlotte, park at Moore’s Parking Lot, 114 West Sixth Street. Journey to Lexington, where they meet the V.M.I. Keydets as the feature of the institution’s 100th anniversary celebration. The Devils are tied with Clemson for second place in the conference with a record of two wins and no losses. Although the Keydets have not lost a conference game since 1937, their slate is marred this year by a tie. Clemson’s Tigers face their toughest test of the season this weekend as they meet the Deacons.

Knoxville Stalwarts

Jay Bolin and Bob Johnson are two sons of Knoxville, Tenn., on the Wildcat team this year who are ably upholding their native state’s tradition for great athletes at Davidson. Bolin is a back and has seen much action this year, scoring one of the touchdowns against The Citadel. Johnson, a guard, has stood out both on the defense and offense. His defensive work was especially good in the V.M.I. game. Both of these boys are juniors and are expected to be mainstays of next year’s edition of the Wildcats, having gained valuable experience this season.

The Phi Delts won the inter-fraternity football championship by defeating the Phi Gams in a close game last Tuesday. In the games played last Monday, the S.A.E.'s defeated the Phi Delts by the margin of one first down, the result of a pass from Thomas to Harrison. At the same time, the S.P.E.'s sprung a mild upset by beating the Phi Gams 3 first downs to 0. On Tuesday, the Phi Delts won the championship by defeating the Phi Gams 6 to 0. The touchdown came on the last play of the first half when Hunter passed to Dale, who ran 20 yards for the score. On the same day, the Kappa Sigs nosed out the Pikas, 1 to 0 in first downs.

K.A.'s Win, Lose

In a protested game, the Sig Eps won 6-0 on a pass to McDaniel. Earlier in the week, the K.A.'s beat the Pikas 12-0. Monday, the Pi Kapps nosed out the K.A.'s 6-0 on a touchdown by McCall. Coach Pete Whittle, inter-dormitory and inter-fraternity sports manager, announced that basketball will begin Tuesday. Basketball will be conducted in the same way as football, with the round-robin system of play. Badminton will begin when the net season ends among fraternities.

Statistics On Citadel Game Last Saturday

Against Citadel: In their first victory of the season, the Wildcats flashed a powerful offensive attack. By running, the Cats covered 243 yards against Citadel's 78. This yardage was chalked up through and around the tackles and ends. The first downs were about even, each team earning eleven. With the aid of the accurate flinging of Spencer and Sharpe, the Davidsons completed five of seven passes for 31 yards. Citadel attempted 16 aerials, making eight of them good for 110 yards. The poor punting of both teams was probably due in part to the rainy weather and slick ball. The Cat punters averaged 31 yards, while the Bulldog booters were a little better with 37. Wildcat linemen got down under punts well Saturday, the Cadets’ safety men being able to run back Davidson's kicks for a mere two yards. The Cats returned punts for a total of nineteen yards. Kickoffs were returned by Davidson for a total of 48 yards and by Citadel for 53 yards. Penalties were frequent, Davidson being set back 70 yards and Citadel 45. Davidson intercepted one Brigade pass and had none of its own intercepted.

Safety For Wildcats

By Julien McCall

Davidson’s Wildcats, playing a powerful offense, defeated the Citadel’s Light Brigade by the score of 22-14, last Saturday afternoon in the climax of the Davidson Homecoming festivities. Led by the powerful running of Dave Spencer, Jay Bolin, Gene Shannon, Granville Sharpe, and Claude Hackney, the Cats were able to pile up a total of 243 yards from rushing to the Cadets’ 78 yards; while the Citadel, however, completed 8 passes out of 16 attempts for a total of 110 yards. The Wildcats were able to complete 5 out of 7 tosses for 31 yards. Playing a large role in Davidson's offense was the blocking in the backfield by Stan Yoder and Bill Bolin; and the great offensive game displayed by the entire Cat forward wall.

Citadel Scores Twice

Citadel, also dangerous, presented an offensive threat all through the game. Their running attack, stopped most of the afternoon by the Cat line, was never a great menace to the Wildcats; but the Cadets’ passing attack, led by the ever-dangerous arm of Graham Edwards, continued to be successful and led to the Light Brigade’s two touchdowns. Davidson received the opening kick-off and after two line plays punted to The Citadel. The Cadets kicked back after one unsuccessful running play. The Cats then began a 60-yard march which ended with a short fourth-down pass from Dave Spencer to Stan Yoder for the Wildcats’ first touchdown. Yoder's conversion was good, making the score 7-0 for Davidson. Citadel evened the score a few minutes after the second quarter began.

Booters Lose To Devils 1-0

Capitalizing on hard rushing tactics, Duke's Blue Devils defeated the Davidson soccer team on its own field last Friday by 1-0. The Devils’ score came in the third period after an evenly contested half. This loss brings the Cats’ average to two defeats and one win for the year. Captain Tommy Harnsberger is hopeful of adding another victory to the win column Saturday morning when the Wildcats attack the High Point YMCA team at 10:30. Friday's contest against Duke showed an improved Davidson squad, but one which is definitely in need of more practice, according to Harnsberger. Many scoring opportunities were lost by wild goal shots. The Wildcats’ rushing and ball covering, however, showed especial improvement. Joe Graham, Gammon, McFadyen, and Harnsberger led the Davidson play with Fletcher and Assan outstanding for the Blue Devils. Ed Maxwell, partially blinded by a flying ball, is still in the infirmary, but is greatly improved.

SEASON ENDS

Davidson's more experienced varsity cross-country team will run its last meet of the season this Saturday against Guilford College. The start is scheduled for 11 o'clock that morning. Guilford has won over Davidson for the last two years, winning by a two-point margin last year and reports are that they have a good team this season. The Davidson team will have their time trials Wednesday.
