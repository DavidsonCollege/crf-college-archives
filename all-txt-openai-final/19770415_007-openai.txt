Vagueness Blurs Power Increase

[Continued from page 6]

I think not. Both Lawrimore and student staffers of WDAV tell me that much of the station’s equipment and at least some of the music is simply too old, of too poor quality to use on a high-power station. When Lawrimore finishes his “careful evaluation,” I believe he will have to spend at least $13,000 to upgrade the equipment (and that is a conservative figure). So to go on the air with any kind of technical adequacy will cost at least $65,000.

$65,000 is a lot of money. I will not list the projects and departments that could sorely use that considerable sum. Add then the operating budget—$25,000 yearly. In two years, $50,000 just to staff and operate the station, and that’s assuming no increases in salaries or costs. Add then the automation option at $36,000. Money from where? And have we considered that an ambitious publicity campaign may be required to get the station off the ground? Bill Burkholder suggests “aggressive use of billboards and program guides during the station’s first few months of operation to ensure exposure to the Charlotte population follows logically and will also cost money.”

Capital cost of $65,000 plus $50,000 operating costs in only two years, we could be spending $125,000 for a radio station. And with the optional automation equipment, the price tag would creep into the $150,000 range. But the proponents come screaming, “No, no. Those figures aren’t representative. We will be able to raise money for the station.”

The college is in the process of applying for a Federal grant from the Government Office of Education. Proponents hope the grant will pay 75 percent of the start-up capital costs for the WDAV expansion. The application is not yet complete, but Lawrimore has indicated that the college will request upwards of $150,000. If everything goes perfectly and we receive 75 percent funding, the college must still pay over $37,000 for a radio station.

Costs Considerable

A Federal grant would doubtlessly reduce the cost of a radio station. But the capital cost would still be considerable, at least as high as $37,500. And the Federal grant does not pay for the yearly operating budget. That means that $25,000 yearly must be raised just for the station to break even.

Lawrimore’s proposal outlines plans for program sponsorship by commercial firms, a subscription service, a sub-carrier broadcasting service, and a Davidson Sports Network. “I don’t know at this point how many dollars any of these can bring in,” says Lawrimore, quickly adding, “but I don’t think it’s unreasonable to assume that we can raise enough for the $25,000 operating budget.”

He doesn’t think it’s unreasonable, but I have encountered no information that supports his thinking.

Revenue Unsure

In fact, information I have obtained indicates that those proposing the expenditure admit it is impossible to estimate how much revenue the station can bring in, that the best guess that can be made with present information is that half the initial capital outlay and half the annual operating costs could be raised from outside sources. At least one administrator is doubtful that even half the operating budget can be raised from outside sources.

You may ask, “With these high costs and uncertain revenue sources, why is the administration interested in a high-power station?” Says Spencer, in reply, “You go by the judgment of what other people can tell you. I rely rather heavily on Dr. Stair’s judgment.”

Dr. Fred Stair, a Davidson grad and Trustee, is President of Union Theological Seminary. Union has an educational-type radio station we are apparently using as a model. “He considers that (station) of great value to them in Richmond...And they get back enough of their expenditures so that they think that whatever else they spend is well worth it.”

Comparisons Needed

I’m sure Dr. Stair is a fine man, but if I were committing my college to a proposal as far-reaching as an expensive high-power radio station, I’d like to have facts and figures about the Union station as well as Dr. Stair’s good judgment. Just how much money do they spend, how much do they take in, what is their operating budget, and many other questions come to mind. Wake Forest has a station (WFDD-FM) similar in some (though not all) ways to the one we are considering. Why don’t we get figures on their expenditures, income, staffing, programming, and so on.

Lawrimore admitted to me yesterday that no such formal studies have ever been made. “It would be nice to have that information, but we’ve been so busy with other aspects of the WDAV plans that we just haven’t had the time that it takes to conduct a survey.”

I suggest that these studies should have been made before any other plans or programs were proposed. Put these figures out for all to see, so we can see what other institutions have invested. Before we make a commitment, let’s make sure that the college community is aware of the outlay required.

Spencer says that once the radio station is started, “it’s just like anything else you do at a college. If you make a commitment to do something you fund it...you’ve got to operate it.”

Before we make that commitment let’s stop now and study carefully similar stations at other schools. Don’t just assume that the station will be a good investment because people at other stations say they are satisfied with their operations. Davidson is not other places. What works at Union might just not work at Davidson. Let’s make some attempt to assess the station’s benefit to our fundraising campaign.

Spencer Unclear

My worry is that President Spencer is not really clear on just how involved this radio station is. He thinks that $52,000 will get us on the air. Everyone else I’ve talked to says extra money for...Studio and album improvements are almost a certainty to be spent before we go on the air. Spencer thinks we have "a very adequate classical collection." Lawrimore and students say we need considerable improvements in classical music before we go high power. I'm not trying the old reporter's trick of playing one source against another to make Spencer look stupid. I am just very concerned that he is pushing a proposal that involves much more than he now realizes. Spencer says he doesn’t believe the radio station will be an elaborate, complicated operation. Not complicated? On Wednesday, the TRANSCO oil company seriously complicated the lives of radio station proponents by refusing to install the station's broadcasting antenna. 

I suggest that this is only the first of what will prove to be a series of complications for the college if WDAV is expanded.

### Role of Media Board

The First Davidson College Media Board is now formed. The Board has broad powers over the media realm, and I suggest that the Board undertake as its first project a thorough study of the proposal to expand WDAV. The implications of Lawrimore’s proposal are, to me, unsettling. I want to know if you on the Board believe that a $25,000 yearly operating budget is wise for a college that should watch every penny. I want to know if student participation on the station will be at the absolute maximum and professional assistance at a minimum. I want to know if the station’s programming will be geared almost exclusively to the Charlotte population with only token concessions to the Davidson student body. But most importantly, I urge the Media Board to question the administration’s underlying assumption that the radio station will contribute more resources than it expends. I want substantive facts and figures from the Union station, explaining thoroughly their staffing, programming, intake, expenditures, etc.

I want to remind Covington, Downs, Bessilieu, Hankins—the four students on the Board—that WDAV should be, above all, a student station, staffed by and directed primarily towards the interests of the Davidson student. I would like to remind Winkler, Terry, Currie, and Satterwhite that this school is first and foremost a teaching institution. Remember that ostentatious, money-flinging proposals that promise to enhance financial support seldom solve problems. Carefully spent, properly directed monies do most to improve the caliber of a college.

### Disturbing Opinions

The opinions of another member of the Board particularly disturb me. In an interview with Buck Lawrimore for the February 21 Davidsonian (before his selection to the Media Board), I asked Lawrimore: "What should the role of the Media Board be in determining the plans for the radio station?" His reply: "The radio station will require so much attention and thought that it needs a Board of its own (WDAV Board) at this time. When things are running smoothly, the Media Board could be expanded to include the radio station." This week he said, "We are trying more than ever to concentrate the decision-making process in the Board of Directors of the radio station to be sure that faculty, staff, and students have input into all major decisions...to make sure there is mutual understanding and agreement."

It does not surprise me that he wishes to concentrate decision-making in the Board. Apparently, they have stopped questioning the basic premise that the radio station is a wise investment. A student on the Board has admitted his belief that the whole proposal to upgrade WDAV is a tremendous waste of money. He feels, however, that the higher-ups (Spencer and Lawrimore) have already made the crucial decision, i.e., we will spend a considerable amount of money for a radio station, and sees his role as one of trying to make sure the money will go where it does the students the most good. That some on the WDAV Board have accepted the fact that the college is wasting its money by building a radio station is, to me, most disturbing.

### Media Board Obligations

The Media Board must fulfill its obligations to oversee the student media. No more talk of "just getting off the ground...electing a chairman...not really sure what we are supposed to do..." Look in the College Constitution. "The Media Board is responsible for the student media and reports to the Trustees through the President...it approves the budgets of these media and reviews their finances." (From the College Constitution)

As best I can tell, every change in the proposed expansion is directly related to some monetary outlay of the radio station: the high power itself, the improvements, the staffing, the operating budget, the very decision to go high power, the whole bit. The station falls under the Media Board’s jurisdiction right now, and I don’t want you, Mr. Lawrimore, to work out your plans in the DAV Board meetings, draft an impressive proposal, and drop it in the lap of the Media Board, saying "here, look over this, just remember that we radio people worked it up, and we know the problems inside and out." I don’t want the expansion plans to be "running smoothly" before the Media Board investigates them. I want the Media Board to go over them step by step, carefully weighing the basics.

### Questions

The questions I have mentioned and others like them are the very same ones I began asking two months ago. I’ve asked them of Spencer at various times, of Lawrimore, of the WDAV Board, and various of the DAV staff. Either they don’t know, won’t tell, or give nebulous descriptions of tentative and very tentative proposals. I’m tired of tentatives. Lawrimore told me once, "we don’t view this (the radio station) as a multi-thousand dollar rat-hole to pour money into." I think back...$52,000...$21,000...$25,000 yearly...$36,000...advertising campaign...a new tower....

Media Board, the responsibility is yours. The rat-hole must not open.
