Good & Bad?

Something very peculiar has happened over the last few weeks. I’m not sure exactly how this started, but the nature of the mail I have been receiving in the Good & Bad mailbox has changed significantly over the past few weeks. Initially, I thought I had a couple of quacks on my hands; from what I understand, even the best columnists get a few loopy letters each month. But I’m convinced this is different, on toward serious. Read a few examples, and you’ll see what I mean.

Well, that iced it. New format? Help them with problems? I have at least a gillion letters like these, all signed with things like “Baffled in Buffalo.” I can’t believe this—all these people think this is some advice column. This isn’t what I had expected at all...

Those first letters had been so encouraging: people telling me about Bad food and Good TV record advertisements—all the things. What fun. But now, I’m stumped. I don’t know what to do. I maybe ought to ask Ann Lan—wait. These people think this is the Ann Landers column.

Okay, here’s some advice: 1) Put out flyers in all the bathrooms and you’ll guarantee a response. Necking’s okay as long as you don’t kiss; 2) So it’s plumbing. If they can’t take a joke, ditch ’em; 3) I can’t figure out who’s a guy and who’s a girl, or whether they’re both guys or both girls, so all I can say is “Wing it,” hoping you have a better sense of gender than mine plus some moral/ethical values to figure out what’s Good and what’s Nice. At any rate, bona fide sin is better than bush-league sin. Send ’em a Candygram and forget about it.

Keep those letters coming. I think I’ve found a new format. It would be nice, however, just to get one G & B letter.
