### Series of Car Break-ins Puts Campus on Alert

Davidson’s campus hardly seems like the ideal place for a crime wave. Due in large part to the Honor Code, many students feel little need to carefully guard their personal possessions. A recent series of car break-ins, however, has provided a rude awakening to students who often take campus safety for granted.

Almost all of the looted cars were parked in Satellite, the northernmost end of the parking lots behind West Hall. According to Officer Tricia Warren, the windows in most of the cars were broken before the thieves entered, save for one case in which the car’s doors had been left unlocked.

Officer Warren urged students not to leave easy-to-steal items like CDs in parked cars.

“I know this could have happened anywhere, but it was still a shock to find my car broken into at Davidson. It’s something that normally doesn’t even cross anyone’s mind around here,” said Lee Bruner ’04, whose car fell victim to the thieves.

“I found my car on Tuesday afternoon. It was parked right under the light in the middle of Satellite. The passenger side window was shattered, and the CD player ripped out of the console.”

Nick Brandham ’04 and Rob Neuman ’04 were also among last week’s victims; all had Alpine AM/FM CD players installed in their cars.

“Pissed? Oh, I’m pissed,” stated Neuman when asked his reaction.

According to the Office of Public Safety, a total of 14 cars have been hit. All of the stolen stereo systems were AM/FM CD players, and the thieves seem to be showing a preference for Pioneer and Alpine systems. Additionally, the thieves have been making off with CDs and money left in cars.

Bruner expressed concern over the college’s response, saying, “The thing that bothers me is that after my car was broken into earlier in the week, the Campus Police apparently didn’t take any serious preventative measures that could have deterred the following break-ins.”

“Since students often have no other option than to park in Satellite, I hope campus security patrols the lot more often each and every night,” Brandham added.

The Office of Public Safety is “not saying exactly what we’re doing” to address the problem and prevent further thefts. However, Officer Warren did assure students that police patrols in Satellite have been increased. “We’re doing all we can,” she said.

In an email to the student body, Dean of Students Tom Shandley announced that the north gate to the parking lot will be closed and locked indefinitely. These increased security measures will be implemented “for as long as necessary.”
