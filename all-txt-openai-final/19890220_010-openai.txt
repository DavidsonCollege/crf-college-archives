The Dream

My mind began its falling,
Straining then I fought to stop
As if falling in a well
Never to be sucked all in.
There was no break to what was happening,
My mind stayed open as I fell down,
No break that I could tell.
But the closing would begin.
I locked the world away
To find my wings and save myself.
The deeper down I went
I did my best to fly
And cursed the world for poison
That seemed to have been sent.
But what I fought had a hold on me,
Not one last grasp to try.
A ripe, fresh fruit to a rotted one,
A hopeless struggle to save a mind,
The purpose was not fair,
A mind that was my own.
As I fell away from the world around,
The good no longer there.
And as I hit that bottom hard --
I awoke from my dream with a groan.
—Betsy Boyd, ’92

I am a poet...

I am a poet of the impoverished masses.
My audience will be here momentarily,
They are outside defecating
In the streets.

It isn’t that they have no restraint.
They would use a toilet if they had one or
If you would lend them yours.

(Oh, but then how could the little boys
Warm their hands in their pee
And not leave a mess for Matilda?)

I like the coincidence of fecal remains
And black asphalt.
I like the angle of the building with the
Sidewalk and the presence of
An ample elimination.
I enjoy the wrinkled noses of the passersby.

Best of all is the imprint of the shoe.
It is a precarious intimacy, but the closest
Some ever come to my people.

Observe the tourist with camera in hand
And excrement underfoot. He wishes to
Photograph his wife beside the presidential
Palace. Watch him pivot mercilessly.

He knows not what he is doing.

I saw the squatting, Indian philosopher who
Precipitated this existential dilemma.
It is a shame that the two could not
Have met under better circumstances.

—Armistead, ’89
