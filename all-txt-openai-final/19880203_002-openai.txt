**Duke Endowment awards Davidson $675,000**

A new professorship in international studies, automation of the campus library, and a pilot program to help freshmen cope with drug, sex, and stress-related problems are among the beneficiaries of a $675,000 grant to Davidson College from the Duke Endowment, college President John W. Kuykendall announced Jan. 8. The Endowment gave Davidson $150,000 as the fifth installment toward a $1 million endowment for the James B. Duke Professorship in International Studies. A search committee has been named and the college hopes to announce the first Duke professor during 1988.

Davidson received $525,000 for two far-reaching programs. “Focus on Technology” seeks to integrate technology into traditional liberal arts disciplines through library automation, personal computing, and membership in a state-wide educational computer network. “Focus on Students” aims to enrich the student experience by expanding academic and psychological support programs such as the “Wellness” course created by a health educator to help freshmen deal with drugs, alcohol, human sexuality, and other stresses.

Since its establishment in 1924 by North Carolina industrialist James Buchanan Duke, the Duke Endowment has awarded grants totaling more than $30.8 million to Davidson. The Endowment is one of the nation’s largest private foundations with assets totaling approximately $800 million.

**Kresge Foundation gives Davidson $800,000 for sports complex**

The Kresge Foundation of Troy, Michigan has awarded an $800,000 challenge grant to Davidson College to stimulate the completion of fundraising for the $17 million sports complex. Davidson has already raised $11.4 million for the complex, and terms of the Kresge award require the college to raise the remaining $4,843,124 by July 1, 1989, to receive the $800,000. The award is one of the largest the foundation has ever given to a liberal arts college, said Alfred H. Taylor Jr., chairman of the Kresge Foundation.

The Kresge Foundation is an independent, private foundation created by the personal gifts of Sebastian S. Kresge, founder of the Kresge chain of retail stores. It made $45,155,000 in grants to 151 charitable organizations in 1986, including the areas of higher education, health care, arts and humanities, social service, science, and conservation.

**Mellon Foundation awards $275,000 to Davidson**

The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation of New York has awarded a $275,000 grant to Davidson College to enhance the teaching and learning of foreign languages and cultures in the next five years. According to college president John Kuykendall, the grant will be used to add faculty positions in Russian, Chinese, and Japanese and to create new programs in Russian and Soviet studies as well as Asian studies. The grant will also provide funds for increased opportunities for overseas study, improved language facilities on campus, and courses in the history, traditions, and culture of areas related to language study programs.

Davidson College has received $1.3 million from the Mellon Foundation since 1972, including a $275,000 grant in 1983 to encourage “fresh combinations” in teaching and learning.

**Come sail!**

Sailing at Davidson has always been a popular activity among many students as a relaxing escape from the drudgery of academic life. The feeling experienced when one, after the misery of a day in the classroom, goes out to the lake campus, gets out on the water, and becomes drenched by cold spray as a powerful wind drives the boat through white-capped waves has been compared to the sensation of rebirth and freedom the Apollo astronauts experienced during their spacewalks.

It seems odd that sailing, with so much to offer the Davidson student, has been neglected as a serious sport in past years. Yet student support for sailing has brought the program back to life. The sailing team has competed in all the regattas in the South Atlantic Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association this fall. This spring term, the Sailing Club is working towards convincing the athletic department that funds should be allocated to support a varsity sailing program. A strategy to achieve this goal is being developed by core members of the Sailing Club. The plans revolve around a more structured approach to involving interested students.In sailing, on Wednesday, February 10, a sailing meeting will be held in the Union to elect new officers and discuss plans for rebuilding the Sailing Team. Anyone who is interested in sailing and would like to devote their energies to an effort to make sailing a more prominent activity is welcome to attend.

Davidson issues bonds to finance sports complex, new dorms

Davidson held the closing event of the Sesquicentennial year with what may have been the largest convocation ever held on the Davidson campus. As Love Auditorium was too small for the expected crowd of faculty, staff, students, parents, and friends, the gym was picked as the location. Even though the use of an athletic area to stage an academic gathering seemed unusual, the convocation proceeded well.

The one unusual aspect of the convocation was the placement, in all the seats, of flyers stating the college choir’s call for a review of the college’s faculty evaluation procedures in response to the recent decision not to renew the contract of Choir Director Frank Albinder.

The Convocation included the recognition of those members of the Davidson College community with outstanding records of service, the first official appearance of the Davidson College mace carved by Davidson alumnus Jack Ram- 892-9046, a gift by the Sesquicentennial Gift Committee, and finally the convocation address by President John Kuykendall. Appearing on the mace is a representation of the cupola of “Old Chambers,” and on the sides are carvings representing the college: the college seal, the Sesquicentennial logo, and representations of the Eumenean and Philanthropic Literary Societies. The mace will be on display in the Library during February.

The gift presented by the Sesquicentennial Gift Committee is a Sesquicentennial Garden centered around the Old Well, which is slated for renovation. It is hoped that the Old Well will once again become a focal point of the campus, providing rest and repose to all who come.

The focus of the Convocation was President Kuykendall’s address entitled “To Endure and to Excel.” In his speech, he challenged Davidson to continue its traditions of excellence into the future by building on the past.

Davidson’s $20 million AA-rated educational bond issue sold out the first day it was offered on December 16. The bonds, technically issued through the North Carolina Educational Facilities Finance Agency, provide Davidson with the capital it needs for the construction of the Baker Sports Complex and three new dormitories. The bonds are attractive to investors because interest paid to the holder is not taxed. This advantage also allows the issuing institution to offer them at lower interest rates than taxed bonds.

According to college business manager Bob Sutton, the Davidson bonds were issued in $5,000 denominations. Some will be due as soon as December 1989, while others will not be due for 25 years. Sutton said that most bonds were sold to individuals, but that some of the longer-term bonds went to institutional buyers. Sutton added that the interest rate average for all the bonds was 7.82% per year. That means that Davidson will need to budget an average of $1.9 million for the next 25 years to retire the debt. The total cost to the school will come to $43.161 million.

Although that sounds like a lot of debt, Sutton said it is a very attractive way for the college to raise funds for immediate needs. “If we couldn’t issue bonds, our choices would be to delay construction until we had raised all the money necessary or to get the capital from our endowment. By leaving the endowment intact, we’ll earn more money in interest than we’re paying out to cover the bonds,” Sutton noted.

The money received through the bond sale will be invested in several trust funds to earn additional interest for the college. Money from these funds will be paid to contractors on the projects as bills come due during the next 19 months.
