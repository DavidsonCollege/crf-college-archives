**Three Trains Between Midnight And 5 A.M. Fifty Feet Away**

**PLANS DIVERSIFIED PROGRAM**
**APO Adds 11 Pledges, Distributes Directories**

Alpha Phi Omega, national service fraternity, distributed its school directory to students and added 11 pledges this week. Officers for
the coming year were elected at a meeting earlier this month. Mike Carroll is the new president; John Adams, first
vice-president; Tom Brown, second vice-president; Ken Tarleton, secretary; and John Reynolds, treasurer.

Through the ideas of Dr. Wayland Hayes, visiting professor of sociology from Vanderbilt, and the interest of several faculty members,
especially Dr. Max Polley, this group arose to provide interested faculty members with ideas and discussions in a wide range
of disciplines.

The publishing of this year's directory had been delayed due to a conflict with the printer. Carroll apologized for the
delay in publishing the student directory. "We had trouble with the printers; they wanted too much money," he stated. He
pointed out that the delay was unavoidable since new printers had to be found. Next year's directory would be out
within the first two months of school, he said. Advertisements are now being sold in order to make certain that
the directory comes out on time.

his banking career with Wachovia after he graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of North Carolina. He became the
chairman of the board in 1965 and director of the Charlotte branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. He
has had many significant directorships in industrial companies since then, including Western Electric Company.

Davis served as North Carolina State Senator from 1958 to 1962. He is now a director of the Chamber of
Commerce of the United States, president of the Research Triangle Foundation of North Carolina, and a director of the North
Carolina Engineering Foundation. He is also a trustee of the University of North Carolina, Salem Academy and College, and Converse
College; a former trustee of Winston-Salem Teachers College, and a former chairman of the Morehead Scholarship Committee.

**JACKSON HEIGHTS**

**Couples Live In Village Huts**

Take three guesses where Jackson Heights is. In New York? Nope. In a novel by Sinclair Lewis? Nope. Give up?
Well, Jackson Heights is in Davidson and it’s the home of four married students who affectionately call it "Cardboard Village."

Jackson Heights consists of four college-owned houses that were built right before the war "with material left over from the
east side of the stadium." Derek Lindsley, Claude Owen, Jack Brinkerhoff, Jim Melton, and their wives live there, along with
Melton’s son, Matthew. The houses are located on Railroad Street off Griffith Street, and for those of you who don’t
know where that is, it's about fifty feet on the east side of the four college-owned houses that tracks. This
makes for "lots of good trains," according to Derek Lindsley, coming through all the time. Five trains pass the house
every day, and three of them come between midnight and five in the morning. But, according to Lindsley, "You get
used to it after a while and you only notice it when the vibrations knock off a lamp shade or
something."

The trains aren’t the worst part, though. When the Meltons arrived last year, they could see daylight through their walls,
so all of the couples have painted the houses thoroughly.

**IFC Sets Greek Week, Plans Faculty Visitation**

The Interfraternity Council set up tentative plans for Greek Week, which will last from noon on April 4 to midnight
on April 8, at their meeting Monday night. The basic plan is to schedule activities on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
so as not to interfere with individual chapter activities and the pledges’ study time. A banquet in honor of all
the pledges will be held in the Union on Monday night. Invited to it will be the pledges, the pledge
trainers, the IFC representatives, and the faculty advisers to each fraternity.

The IFC is trying to schedule William E. LeClerc, executive secretary of Chi Psi fraternity, for the chapel period on
Wednesday. If he does not speak then, he will speak at the banquet Monday night.

A proposal was made by several IFC representatives to revive the skits by the pledge classes on Wednesday night. The
Greek Week Committee, however, desiring to plan a Greek Week that would demonstrate the positive values of fraternity membership, decided
that these skits would be a negative factor.

Friday afternoon will feature the competition in Greek games among the pledge classes. Stan Brown, Sigma Phi Epsilon representative, is
in charge of the pledge class regatta. The IFC decided that there would be no competition on any other pledge
class projects. It also planned the fraternity open houses for the faculty. These open houses will be held once a
month, and there will be three houses open each time. Letters have been sent to all members of the faculty
explaining the procedure and inviting them to attend.

**Faculty Forms Group, Features Discussion**

A new faculty discussion group has been formed on campus to fill the vacuum created by the disintegration of the
faculty book club groups after the year 1963-64. The organization is modest in purpose, its only ambition being the improvement
of the campus intellectual climate through interdisciplinary discussions, according to Dr. R. E. Gift of the Economics Department.

This group was patterned after similar groups at Vanderbilt. Discussions involve the formal presentation of a paper followed by criticism
and discussion among the group. The group, meeting monthly, has discussed Dr. A. S. Abbott's book, "Shaw and Christianity," and
some original research by Dr. J. T. Drake on the social aspects of academic freedom.

**Welsh To Present Bach's ‘Catechism’**

Organist Wilmer H. Welsh, associate professor of music, will be heard in his annual spring recital at 8:15 p.m. next
Friday, in the Davidson College Presbyterian Church. Welsh will play the Johann Sebastian Bach Catechism. This work is a musical
statement of the principal articles of the Christian faith. The body of the work consists of 10 extended chorale preludes
for manuals and pedal, interspersed with shorter chorale preludes, fughettas, and duets for manual alone. Professor Welsh played this all-Bach
recital at St. Paul's Chapel at Columbia University in New York and at Cornell University recently.

**Speaking on “Communism in Latin America” to members of PRAM from Davidson, Queens, Belmont Abbey, and Sacred Heart, Dr. Phillip
Secor explained that nationalistic and socialistic expressions of the lower classes in Latin America have been mistaken in the**United States
as being communist-inspired. Secor concluded that study and development are more important than the dangers of communism in South America.

EXPOUNDING tions have been sent to those who are invited this Sunday after Vespers.

Dentists To Speak To AED

A special open meeting of the AED pre-medical fraternity next Wednesday will feature talks by representatives of the N.C. Chapter
of the International Association of Dental Research.

"Covering the cracks with masking tape," adds Lindsley. Two of the houses have one bedroom, and the other pair have
two, but since the floor spaces are all the same, the two-bedroom houses have sort of an arbitrary dining area—that
is—none at all. Besides the thin walls and train vibrations, there are swarms of termites. In some places, you can
press on the walls and they'll give about a quarter of an inch because of termite damage. On the bright
side, however, the houses have excellent ventilation. In fact, it is so good that the hot air escapes during the
winter and lets in nice, fresh air. The fact that the windows won't close fully helps the "ventilation" a great
deal. One person swore that there were so many air leaks in his house that it snowed inside! Others were
very complimentary of their "good neighborhood" which swarms with local color. Other married students, who aren’t as lucky, rent or
live in Davidson or commute from Cornelius, Mooresville, or Charlotte. There are around 22 married students altogether. The one real
advantage to living in "Cardboard Village" is that it is off-campus as far as college regulations are concerned. Lindsley summed
things up when he said, "My house is sort of like a car trunk."

SANDS IS CHAIRMAN

Students Against NSA Organize In Meeting

The Davidson College STOP NSA (Students To Oppose Participation in the National Student Association) Committee was organized Tuesday night under
the chairmanship of Steve Sands. The Committee, a local branch of a national committee of the same name, was formed
in hopes of securing the withdrawal of the Davidson Student Body from the Association. The members, Sands, Tom Irons, Ed
Armfield, Dan Campbell, Ben Cannon, Harry McMullen, Jim McNair, and David Lewis, oppose affiliation for various reasons ranging from its
lack of service to student governments to its misrepresentation of Davidson student opinion.

The Davidson Student Body has been affiliated with the NSA since 1961, when the Student Council decided upon its own
authority that Davidson should affiliate. Previously the student body had been a member by virtue of the Student Council’s membership
but had withdrawn. In 1963, there was a referendum on the Student Council action of two years before, in which,
after full discussion and after an extremely pro-NSA campaign by the Student Council under President John Spratt, the affiliation was
approved by a small majority.

The National Student Association was founded in 1946 as an association of student governments. There is no such thing as
individual membership in NSA as students on a given campus are represented by virtue of a school’s student government membership.
"NSA claims to represent the views and aspirations of this college and to represent a student point of view which
is the most representative that can be obtained by the democratic process," Lewis stated. "Yet, in the annual convention of
this year, they approved resolutions so radical that they have grossly misrepresented the majority student opinion of the United States.
Also, each year as NSA devotes more time to politics, it does less and less to achieve the major goal
for which it was supposedly organized—to serve member schools. It has been criticized on campus as being ineffective, inefficient, and
useless."

"NSA is not the answer for schools genuinely interested in solutions to student government problems, nor is it the proper
place for shaping interest in national affairs," Lewis concluded.

FYR Elects Director: MacNair Gets Post

Jim MacNair was recently elected regional director of the College Council of the N.C. Federation of Young Republicans at its
convention in Winston-Salem. MacNair, a freshman at Davidson, succeeds Joe Beard, also a Davidson student, in this post. His job
will be to maintain communications between the College Council Executive Committee and the member colleges in this area.

A hassle arose over the voting rights and eligibility of the Davidson delegation to the convention. Reported Joe Beard, "The
‘Old Guard’ of the NCFYR reduced our delegation's strength from 12 to 7 votes. By denying credentials of seven of
our delegates and by using similar subterfuges," he continued, "the ‘Old Guard’ was able to cut down the strength of
the College Council and ensure for themselves a majority of the state group."

The Charlotte Observer in an article last week stated that "the credentials committee ruled that each college delegation was entitled
to five votes but that at least five members had to be present or the delegation only had as many
votes as there were members present."

"They expected us to take it lightly," said Beard. "We were later informed by lawyers that the action against us
was probably illegal, so we are appealing it to the National FYR. We don't expect the split to last, and
I think a settlement will be forced upon the NCFYR within a month or so," concluded Beard.

Discussion To Be Held About Jobs

Possibilities for summer service work for college students will be the topic of an informal discussion led by Rev. Joel
Underwood tonight at 7 in the Union Lounge. Also to be discussed are short-term service work and work programs which
last two or three years. Work in these programs is available in both the United States and abroad. Mr. Underwood
will be available tomorrow for interviews. These interviews may be arranged through the college chaplain’s office.

Underwood is a native of Tennessee and has studied at Duke, Vanderbilt, and Boston universities. He has worked in a
number of social service and youth work projects and recently completed a program in missionary orientation. He plans to travel
to India later this year to work and teach.
