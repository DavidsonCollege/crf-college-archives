Mr. Hugo Sapp, local impresario of Sapp’s Cut Rate Drugs, and sports enthusiast of the first order, has long been
a faithful follower of the Red and Black. Between the artful mixing of three-scoop shakes and crooning of “A Door
Will Open,” Mr. Sapp can be induced to venture a few opinions as to the merits and prospects of the
Wildcats. These opinions often bear important significance, strange as it may seem, for the renowned Mr. Sapp is an accomplished
judge of human nature. He can spot a four-scoop man at twenty feet and will brush aside the mass of
one-scoopers to be of service.

Now Hugo is usually a man of good nature and humor and can be counted on for a cheery, if
monetary, smile, but the big wheel of the emporium has had some trying moments in the past couple of years.
You see, when the Cats are winning and the students are proud, they feel within the realm of the three-scoopers,
and our good friend behind the fount is not averse to making an extra nickel. Therefore, since the onset of
the war, Mr. Sapp has known some glum moments. When Woodberry Forest trounced the Kittens last fall, a pall of
gloom descended on the old pharmacy, and Mr. Sapp was scoopless. The future was not bright.

There’s a laugh on the lips of the pudgy promoter of shakes and sports. Today he is happy. Maybe it’s
the Spring. Maybe it’s the new gym. Maybe it’s inflation. But the students are demanding a vast quota of Hugo’s
time and three-scooped shakes, and the extra nickels are rolling in. Now, the reactivation program is hardly in full swing
and the fighting Wildcats have not yet begun to roll over their opponents, but victory is in the air and
goes hand in hand with three-scoop shakes. So keep your eye on the good Mr. Sapp, and three-scoop shakes will
be the order of the day when the Cats start bringing home the bacon.

New Coach Handicapped By Lack Of Courts, But Counts On Vets
By JIM JACKSON

In the arrival of Bill Luter as Davidson’s new tennis coach, Davidson’s tennis foes for the coming season will face
a formidable opponent. Coach Luter comes to Davidson from the Charlotte Country Club at Charlotte, where he has been the
pro since 1940. He was coach at Presbyterian College of South Carolina for three years when they meet Furman.

Coach “Pete” Whittle prospects for victory over the Hurricanes seem bright. With fewer courts available on the campus and with
the recent intra-squad game here, the Wildcats will step into their first varsity competition in three years when they meet
Furman.

Coach Luter has made a brilliant record as coach of the Junior Davis Cup Squad of Georgia in 1938 and
1939, Director of National Model Tennis in the United States Lawn Tennis Association since 1937, and professional at the Charlotte
Country Club since 1940. He was coach at Presbyterian College of South Carolina for three years when they meet Furman.
