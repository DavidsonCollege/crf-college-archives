THE MOST HAPPY FELLA TO BE PRESENTED AT DAVIDSON COLLEGE
“The Most Happy Fella,” Frank Loesser’s musical adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning comedy “They Knew What They Wanted,” will be presented at Davidson College Wednesday, February 3, at 8:15 p.m. in Love Auditorium.

The plot centers on a mail-order bride who discovers she has been tricked by her husband-to-be, Tony, a vineyard owner who is neither as young nor handsome as the face in the photograph he sent her. She allows herself to be married to him, but at the same time falls for Tony's young foreman, the actual face in the photograph.

Tickets are now $3 for students, $5 for others. Available at the Union Box Office, all Dorm Reunions, & the Commons during dinner.

Sen. Dick Clark, a U.S. foreign policy expert and former U.S. Senator from Iowa, will spend the week of January 31 - February 5 at Davidson to share ideas with students and the public.

Clark’s visit, sponsored by the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation of Princeton, N.J.
