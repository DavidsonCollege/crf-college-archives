a Zeta Nu at the University. Omega here and there, here a pin, there a pin, everywhere a frat pin.
“Miss Greek Goddess” has a completely flexible personality she uses, according to the specifications of each successive pin-bearer. The motto
of our Betty Balfour: “I'll get fifty pins on my sweater or bust.” Recommendation: Unless you have a working agreement
with Attleboro, Mass., steer clear of this insatiable number; it hurts to lose the family jewels.

Then there is the “backseat belle” who oughta slow down on those vitamin dosages. However, she is rather guileless about
the situation and accordingly not so dangerous as the others. Recommendation: Do not under any circumstances date one of this
type immediately following such prolonged periods of seclusion as exam period, imprisonment, or ocean voyage.

What many claim to be the most obnoxious of all the types is the Psychology Major. She usually occurs in
the form of a girl’s school freshman or sophomore, and at the drop of a hat she will explain to
you the psychic significance of one’s dropping one’s hat. If you attempt to kiss her, you will be enlightened as
to just what brute impulses motivated your abortive action. (It is not until their junior or senior years that they
take up the Birds-Bees Theory, which some modern investigators hold to be plausible.) Recommendation: She's probably a nymphomaniac; keep an
eye on her — this type sometimes develops favorably.

However, these aforementioned, with all their foibles, cause not one millionth fraction of the pain and anguish you suffer through
that one who has no faults in your eyes. It is amazing (perhaps we burst this upon you too suddenly),
but there is such a type as this, also; one only to each customer. The writer would be a greater
dolt than one falling in the snare of the first four were he to try to devise and set forth
defense against this fifth. Recommendation: By a babbling brook, nestled in a mountain grove of faraway Tibet, there is a
very attractive little monastery.

PHI MU ALPHA

hours and evenings when these programs will be given will be published immediately after the beginning of the second semester.
It is expected that they will consist partly of pre-announced planned groups of musical selections as well as requests made
by listeners. It is hoped that in this way the most benefit can be secured for all from the library,
which consists of a complete survey of music from its earliest written form up to and including Hindemith, Gershwin, and
other twentieth-century composers.

On December 26-29, John Fesperman, president of Phi Mu Alpha, attended the fraternity’s national convention at the University of Michigan,
Ann Arbor. Some one hundred American colleges, universities, and conservatories were represented at this gathering, which featured addresses by Norval
Church, Director of School of Music, Columbia Teachers College, Columbia University, Dr. Earl Moore, Dean of School of Music at
Michigan, as well as several outstanding concerts and other musical events.
