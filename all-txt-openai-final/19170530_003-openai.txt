NEW MEMBERS FOR THE MIMIR SOCIETY

from the Senior class, E. H. Hamilton and D. I. McKeithan; from the Junior class, J. W. Clark, O. J.
Thies, Jr., and J. R. Woods. Dr. C. R. Harding was elected president and J. W. Clark secretary-treasurer for the
coming year. The former members were Drs. W. J. Martin, M. E. Sentelle, J. Moore McConnell, T. W. Lingle, C.
R. Harding, J. R. Douglas, of the faculty, and from the students, H. A. Campbell, '17; F. M. Mitchell, Jr.,

The Mimir Society of Davidson has been recently founded for the purpose of encouraging, furthering, and honoring scholastic attainments among
the students. The right to membership is granted only to those students who have made an average grade of as
much as 93 for three consecutive years. Further, no student is eligible who, in any study, has made less than
ten points above the passing mark. Thus the Mimir Society aims to promote that which the college stands for: intellectual
training. The emblem of the society is a small key, which is in keeping with other honorary society’s emblems. On
the obverse side of the key is Mimir and the bird of wisdom. On the reverse side is the name
of the holder.
