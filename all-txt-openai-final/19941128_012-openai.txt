THE DAVIDSONIAN

The Black Crowes return

By Tom Bavis

Controversial cover notwithstanding, the Black Crowes’ new album Amorica has substance beyond pubic hair. It is the Atlanta band at
its most creative, most original, and most natural.

The album starts off confidently with “Gone” and “A Conspiracy,” two of the album’s most boisterous tracks. When the reverberative
bass drum to “Gone” kicks in, you could swear the laser of your CD player almost jumped off of its
groove. Immediately it is obvious that this album continues the more mysterious and bizarre statements of the band’s last album,
1992’s The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion. Banished forever, the Crowes will make you understand, are the decent but by-the-numbers
classic rock tunes of Shake Your Money Maker, their debut album.

As one of the most unapproachable songs of the album, “A Conspiracy” makes for an odd choice as the band’s
first single. Cut time signatures and wah-wah guitars abound as singer Chris Robinson menacingly begins, “Well did you ever hear
/ the one about last year? / it was all a lie.” His sneer becomes a shout as the music
simultaneously drops its wah-wahs in favor of a swirling, psychedelic section that sets you on edge. Then, at last, comes
the payoff: a catchy chorus that brings the song back into the pop world.

“A Conspiracy,” though maybe not Amorica’s best song, exemplifies what makes this my favorite Crowes album so far. It is
musically adventurous, with guitarist Rich Robinson and company taking many chances and coming out ahead every time. The arrangements fill
the speakers with sound, and even when it’s brash and unsettling you would not want to change a thing.

A steel guitar rests atop the smooth groove of “Wiser Time,” one of the finest songs of the CD. Though
a simple, three-chord song, “Wiser Time” draws you in with Chris Robinson’s gorgeous melodies and lyrics: “No time now left
for shame / horizon behind me, no more pain.”

“A Conspiracy,” “Wiser Time,” and the rest of Amorica make for Chris Robinson’s finest hour as well. Rather than hitting
and missing as he did on the first two albums, he uses his voice in all the right ways. He
continues his Janis-Joplin-meets-John-Lennon style of wiggling his rough little voice around a song; this time, he does not tire you
out. He even dares, on “Wiser Time,” to try some harmony vocals.

Lyrically, Chris Robinson still has his embarrassing moments — for example, “I am a rounder / I like to round
around” from “Downtown Money Waster” — but shows he is still trying. Among his finest hours ever comes at the
end of “Cursed Diamond”: “I hate myself / Doesn’t everybody hate themselves / I scare myself / Then I tell
myself it’s all in my mind.” Finally, he speaks introspectively without veiling the meaning in talk about drugs, leather, or
any of the other trappings of a rock star. Such is true about the entire album. The classic rock-memory slowly
fades as the true identity of the Black Crowes emerges — that of a quirky, moody group of men that
wears its 70s influences proudly and feeds off the tensions between each other. One of the most consistent bands of
the decade, the Black Crowes prove with Amorica that they are no mere one-hit wonder, the guys who did that
kickin’ version of “Hard to Handle.” They have something to prove. If it takes a controversial album cover to get
people to pay attention, so be it.
