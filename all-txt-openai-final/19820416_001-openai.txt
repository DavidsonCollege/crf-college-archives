**Development in the Town of Davidson**
**The Second Article in a Series of Three**

This article is the second in a series on Development in Davidson. It outlines the development taking place in the
town of Davidson itself. Next week, the final article on the future of Davidson will be presented.

The town of Davidson has extensive plans for development which are to be implemented in the near future.

Central to these plans is an extensive downtown revitalization program, which is to begin when final assurances are arranged between
Piedmont Bank and Trust Company and the U.S. Postal Service. Arrangements have almost been finalized for Piedmont Bank to sell
parcels of land to the Postal Service, in order that a new post office may be built on what is
now the vacant lot behind the bank.

Once this deal has been finalized, the town of Davidson has assured the U.S.P.S. that it will commence with the
following projects: Railroad Street will be widened and extended to South Main Street. A pedestrian mall will be established between
the back of Main Street and Railroad Street. It is hoped that many new businesses and offices will open on
this mall, effectively tripling the size of the downtown business district.

“The most successful businesses in Davidson have been those that specialize in the arts and crafts,” reports David. He asserts
that the town plan for downtown development has been virtually unopposed. “What most people have in mind is Davidson as
a village.”

Although plans are for Davidson to remain primarily a residential community, some industry is necessary for a broadened tax base,
and to provide local employment. “Gradual and balanced growth” is Mayor MacCormac’s long-term ideal.

Davidson has recently been awarded a $400,000 Urban Development Action Grant for expansion of its water treatment plant. This grant
enabled the enlargement of the system to accommodate an expansion of the Ingersoll-Rand Plant, which is one of Davidson’s largest
employers. Ground has already been broken for the factory, which is located behind the Oak Hill Apartments.

North Mecklenburg has been a strong candidate for development for some time, since the construction of interstate highways and the
construction of Lake Norman. It is hoped that Davidson will soon iron out problems of control and rate structure with
the City of

Fund, the Morey and Stephen Sands Scholarship Fund, and the Rea C. Tenney Scholarship Fund, are being added to this
year’s awards ceremonies.

According to a letter to students by Dr. Spencer, Convocation is “an important event in the life of the college”
because it is an opportunity “for the whole campus community to get together.” The program should draw a number of
students and over four hundred Davidson graduates to the college this weekend.

The major events of Alumni Weekend consist of “capsule courses” taught by Davidson professors and graduates at
