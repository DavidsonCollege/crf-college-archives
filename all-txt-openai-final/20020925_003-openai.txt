From New Groups, page 1:

(CDSA) in hopes that other disabled or chronically ill Davidson students would find support from others facing similar difficulties while
here at school. Much of what her group does is an extension of the many resources Davidson already has available
to students with special needs. Assisting freshmen in their acclimation process, making Davidson more accommodating for disabled students, faculty, and
visitors are just some of the ongoing tasks taken on by Barnes and other members of the CDSA. The group
is currently working closely with the Admissions office to have campus tours for wheelchair-bound prospective students led by current wheelchair-bound
students to ensure that applicants understand all resources available to them at Davidson. Barnes is excited about the goals of
Davidson’s CDSA. “We hope to make Davidson’s disabled community active and visible,” she says. “Throughout society, persons with disabilities comprise
both the nation’s largest and most under-represented minority population. As a distinct community, disabled persons have a unique set of
interests and concerns that need to be addressed, and Davidson is not an exception to that.”

CDSA hopes to ease the frustrations and difficulties disabled Davidson students face by providing information, support, and a community built
on relationships with others who have shared similar experiences. Barnes says, “We also hope to galvanize Davidson’s disabled community in
constructive and practical ways—seeking to enact or alter policies to make Davidson more accommodating for disabled persons, raising awareness on
campus of various disability-related issues, and challenging the common perceptions of physical disability in general.”

Jewish Student Union

Jewish students on campus are banding together to continue their own religious tradition amid a large Christian population at Davidson.
Kelly Kopeikin ’03 and Jessica Heilweil ’03 are co-leading the Davidson College Jewish Student Union (JSU), which, Kopeikin says, seeks
to “provide for the needs of Jewish students on campus as well as to educate the general Davidson College community
on Jewish traditions.” As the group gathers members, it hopes to celebrate the Jewish religion as well as plan community
events which would both educate and promote tolerance. Like the CDSA, the JSU is working with admissions to help prospective
students understand that Davidson welcomes Jewish students, despite the present small percentage. Group members attend local services and team up
with local colleges to find and plan community events.

Gay-Straight Alliance

With approximately 40 members, the renewed Gay-Straight Alliance (GSA) is another group committed to their cause. GSA president Matt Talbert
’05 says, “This group is not only important but also an essential part of the Davidson community. Davidson’s southern conservative
atmosphere necessitates the creation of a unity between those of this frequently ignored and oppressed minority and its supporters in
the majority.” He continued, “We not only serve as a voice of this minority but as a symbol of the
importance of adhering to basic human self-honesty and truthfulness and the need for society to accept not just one, but
all forms of humanity.” With increased membership, new leadership, and continued support by campus administration, the GSA is becoming a
more dynamic group. Last night, the first annual Gay and Lesbian Film Festival was held on Belk lawn, screening HBO’s
The Laramie Project.Members of a minority—albeit large or small—on Davidson’s campus seem to be the mantra of these new or
renewed groups. Finding identity with other students and together raising awareness in the majority is something that will always build
stronger communities like Davidson.

### Committee Questions Drop/Add Deadline for New Students
**By AMANDA PENNOCK, Senior Staff Writer**

SGA turned over a new leaf on Thursday night, swearing in a brand-new class of first-year and independent senators. Among
those sworn in were Wiley Becker, Christina Evans, Ryan Inman, Bridget Kane, Jeff Larrimore, Charles Pierce, David Pope, Walker Saik,
Francois Trappey, Marc Vinson, Erskine Wells, and Kathryn Wells.

In new business, senators Marc Vinson ’05 and Trip Young ’03 noted a few different directions in which the Education
Committee is moving. Among these is research into the possible extension of the drop/add period for first-year students. Because of
Davidson’s rigorous curriculum, each year many incoming students find themselves over their heads by the end of the first few
weeks of classes. By this time, however, it is often too late for students to change their class schedule, since
drop/add only lasts for two weeks.

Vinson explains, “The issue here arises from students who enroll in classes and might not be completely aware of all
that is or will be required/expected by the teacher. [The biggest problem arises] when the student is in a course
that does not have a lower level to drop to. [At this point], the student may end up in a
situation where his or her failure is almost certain and want to drop the course.” Vinson and Young are investigating
the possibility of extending only the “drop” period to 6 weeks for first-year students. Vinson explained that this would give
new students more time to make this decision. He also emphasized that these issues have not yet been proposed, but
only discussed.

SGA President Gray Patterson ’03 raised the second main point of the evening. Though SGA will have its annual retreat
on Sept. 29 to discuss its goals for the semester, Patterson suggested the hot topic of the Honor Code and
the Code of Responsibility as a potential point of focus for the current academic year. SGA discussed this point for
quite a while, bringing up various questions relating to this issue that might be considered in the future. How does
the Code of Responsibility relate to off-campus activities? Does it extend to student activities in Charlotte? Why do we have
to pledge tests if we are supposedly operating under the constant aegis of the Honor Code? What should happen with
the occasional mix-up with final exam envelopes? How should the Code of Responsibility deal with Patterson Court? How does it
apply to the issue of the Red Bikes? Should upperclassmen have to take “refresher courses” in the Honor Code and
the Code of Responsibility to remind them of its importance at Davidson?

Though these issues appear to point out the weaknesses of the Codes, Patterson said he believes that the constant critiquing
of the Honor Code and the Code of Responsibility is a positive thing in that it keeps the Codes strong
and in the forefront of people’s minds. At its retreat, SGA will determine if these questions are ones it will
pursue answers to in the 2002-03 academic year.
