rooms, told reporters that Editor Scott likes to sleep and is hard to awake in the mornings. The men who were nominated, along with Scott, for the Davidsonian’s editor are: Hartley Hall, Tom Mann, Bill Hollister, Jim Murray, Arnie Covell, Bill Cummings, Dan McKeithen, and John Hobart. The second ballot was a run-off among Hall, Hollister, and Murray. Hall and Murray ran against Scott next, and finally, Hall and Scott were the only men left on the ticket. Business Manager Bill Houck will graduate this year along with Associate Editors Doug Hix, Lonnie Turnipseed, Jack Hazard, and Advertising Managers Wylie Smith and Rod Shaw.

around an open fire, where they heard stories in the ghost category from Bill Hamilton, who related a tale concerning a mad Russian, Tom Abel, who gave some of the story concerning the disappearance of Amelia Earhart, and Jack Stevenson, who told of the more interesting pranks of medical students. Mr. Hamilton added a bit of humor by telling “The Secret Lives of Walter Mitty.” Finally, the same thirty-five who were present toasted marshmallows around the fire. The party broke up around ten-thirty.

THIRD ANNUAL ARTS ... (Continued From Page Two)

Chambers Auditorium. Even the Cincinnati Symphony's performance was marred by the stygian conditions which prevail immediately in front of the stage and throughout the auditorium. Supplementary lighting is a definite need and it is to be hoped that next year performances will not have to be presented under this serious handicap. We have had many concerts here this season—four by professionals—yet such indigenous outcroppings of cultural expression as the arts festival, work of the Red and Black Masquers are worth more than all of the others because they indicate a striving within the group, a reaching out and up for the cultural elements which Davidson needs if it is to be truly a liberal arts college. Let there be no impediment in the way of such expressions. In conclusion, we would like to thank Mr. Pfohl, Mr. Berg, Mr. Sipe, Miss Ashe, and all the others who by their efforts made possible the Third Annual Arts Festival.

It is the intention of the “Y” cabinet that this fund shall continue to be used to raise the standard of housing among the Negro citizens of the town. When and if the need for such assistance no longer exists in the judgment of the board of trustees the money will be used for other community improvements.

For some three months these two have been boarding at the Cathey-Hoyle Funeral Home on the Charlotte Highway. Upon interrogation they report that conditions are much the same as those existing in any private home with the exception of their closets which are cast-off coffin cases. There is also somewhat of a Poe-like atmosphere created by the presence of a hearse and two ambulances. To earn their board they ride as assistants on emergency calls, doing minor first-aid work. Another job consists of keeping the hearse in readiness for funeral processions. Wes says he lets George take care of the latter since he doesn’t have a great affinity for funerals and what usually go with them. As a whole the boys find it a quiet life — “no one barges in to interrupt our study” as Wes puts it. In fact their only kick is with the railroad schedule which sends a train almost through the backyard at two-thirty each morning.
