Davidson Returns to The Southern Conference

By Tom Koonce

In a unanimous vote last May, the Southern Conference Executive Committee agreed to admit Davidson as the league’s tenth member.

The move to get Davidson back into the Southern Conference began last fall, when the league first presented the idea to the college.

Davidson did not immediately jump back into the conference. According to Athletic Director Terry Holland, “We dragged our feet around for a while to see what was best for Davidson.”

Davidson was a member of the Southern Conference from 1936 until 1988. After a few years of competing as an independent, Davidson joined the Big South Conference for the 1990-91 season.

Holland commented on the fact that Davidson was happy with the Big South Conference and was not looking for another league, but the approach by the Southern Conference was something that the college couldn’t ignore.

Holland added, “Our focus right now is still on the Big South.” Davidson will compete in the Big South this season and begin play in the Southern Conference in 1992-93.

The idea of rejoining the Southern Conference was approved by the Davidson board of trustees in May. It was an idea that was looked at from several different angles. Holland said that it was finally decided that the Southern Conference was not inconsistent with Davidson’s concept of athletics.

In joining this league, Davidson must begin a women’s basketball program. While Holland was apprehensive about this when he first came to Davidson, he now believes that women’s basketball is a natural next step for the college. He added that such a program would probably have been pursued regardless of what conference Davidson joined.

In joining the league, Davidson still plans to compete at the Division III level in football. This does present a problem with the NCAA, but this issue will not be addressed until the NCAA convention next winter.

The Southern Conference members are Appalachian State, Furman, The Citadel, East Tennessee State, Tennessee-Chattanooga, Virginia Military Institute, Western Carolina, and Marshall. Davidson and Georgia Southern are the two new members. Georgia Southern will also begin competition in 1992-93.
