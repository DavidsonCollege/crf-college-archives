THE DAVIDSONIAN, MAY 18, 1932

“DOC” MATHIS WINS VARSITY BATTING CROWN

Although Coach Laird’s Wildcat baseball representatives did not enjoy a very successful season, they did bring their season to a happy close by defeating the Demon Deacons by a 1-0 score. Little Charlie Pearce pitched one of the greatest games of his brilliant athletic career, when he allowed the Wake Forest sluggers only two singles and no runs to win Davidson's only Big Five victory and hand the Deacons their lone defeat by a Big Five rival. Bruce Peabody and Earl Bradsher came in for their share of honor when they doubled in succession to give Davidson her one run in the ninth inning. Barnes, of the losers, had held the ’Cats to one single up to that period, but the strain was too great and the two doubles he permitted in the ninth spelled his defeat.

Coach “Doc” Unger’s Freshman baseball team scored three impressive victories during the week in downing Belmont Abbey twice and in plastering a one-sided defeat onto the yearling team from Wake Forest. We had the fortune (or probably misfortune) of helping umpire one of the ‘Kittens’ games and must say that there are prospects for a great varsity team next year. Bumgardner, second baseman for the yearling team, furnished the thrill of the Belmont Abbey game played here last Wednesday, when he hit a homer with three men on bases. The diminutive has a batting average of only .203, but in gathering that average he has hit five home runs, one triple, and six singles.

“Doc” Mathis brought his brilliant collegiate athletic career to a close last Thursday when the Wildcats played the Deacons. Mathis has been a familiar figure on Wildcat teams for the past three years, starring in football, basketball, and baseball. During his three years of varsity eligibility, Mathis has earned no less than eight varsity D’s. In addition, he served as alternate captain of football and captain of basketball during the past season. As a final accomplishment, Mathis won the Wildcat batting crown by leading the varsity in batting averages and scores, and tying for stolen bases.

Since the varsity and freshman athletic program has closed, inter-fraternity baseball, Sigma Delta Psi competitions, and the faculty-senior baseball affair seem to hold sway. The inter-fraternity tournament was scheduled to close last Tuesday with a game between the Kappa Sigs and the Pikas for the championship. Events in the Sigma Delta Psi competitions will be run each afternoon on Richardson Field. The faculty-senior game will not be played until after the close of the semester, but in preparation for the affair the faculty has scheduled a game with the Sigma Phi Epsilon team to be played this afternoon on the freshman field.

Ninety-eight Men Try For Sigma Delta Psi

For the past two weeks competition for membership in Sigma Delta Psi, athletic fraternity, and for the athletic trophy, has been progressing rapidly. Already ninety-eight men, of which fifty-five are Freshmen, have reported to Coach Whittle and have passed off one or more events either on the track or in the gym. Competitors have had chances to try all events except the hundred-yard swim, which is usually run off in the pool in Mooresville and which will be done some time in the near future. There are at present ten men who have passed all but the swim and it is expected that these will pass that event when the time comes and be taken into the fraternity. Coach Whittle stated that he expected that in all there would be about fifteen men who would pass all events and be accepted for membership this year. Competition will be brought to a close tomorrow afternoon due to the fact that exams start the following day.

Mathis Outhits Wildcats To Win Batting Honors

“Doc” Mathis, outfielder, won the batting lead for the 1932 season when he hit safely three times in seven trips to the plate in the Wildcats’ two games during the week. Mathis moved ahead of Earl Bradsher, who got a double in seven trips, and Buck Mills, who failed to hit safely in a like number of times. Mathis gathered a total of 22 hits out of 62 times at bat for an average of .355. Bradsher's average was .353, while Mills’ was 20 points less. Mathis also tied with Fred Blanton for the lead in stolen bases, each having pilfered seven sacks. Captain Bernhardt was next with six. Scoring honors also went to the stocky outfielder, Mathis, who crossed home plate 14 times. Blanton and Mills followed close behind with 13 and 12, respectively.

Buck Mills, shortstop, led in total bases during the season, by hitting 16 singles, two doubles, and four triples for a total of 32 bases. Blanton, with 11 singles and a brace of doubles, triples, and homers, was next with 29 total bases. Peabody took third post by getting nine one-base blows, three two-baggers, and four triples for 27 bases.

Wake Forest Freshmen Downed by Wildkittens

The Davidson College Freshman nine completely turned the tables on the Baby Deacons of Wake Forest, when Charlie Harris hurled the 'Kittens to a smashing 10 to 1 victory on Richardson Field last Friday. Harris, a right-hander, was in fine shape and turned the Little Baptists back with four scattered hits. The batting onslaught of the ‘Kittens shelled two Wake Forest pitchers from the mound, and sent quite a barrage of hits into the third one. Hurler Harris contributed to his cause with a double and a triple, thereby moving up to third place in the batting average list. Morris, Davidson first sacker, had a perfect day at bat with a single, two doubles, and a triple out of four trips to the platter. Mackorell and Bumgarner had four base blows to their credit.

Pearce Bests Barnes in Hurlers’ Duel and ’Cats Triumph Over Deacons

Davidson Rallies in Ninth to Give Deacons Their First Big Five Defeat

A Wildcat nine from Davidson College staged a ninth-inning rally to give Wake Forest a 1 to 0 licking, thereby marring their perfect Big Five record. The game was played on the Deacons’ home field last Thursday, and Lefty Pearce turned the Wake Forest lads back with two scratch hits. Only four men reached first base off the offerings of the chunky little southpaw. Junie Barnes, holding the Davidson sluggers in check until the final canto, pitched a beautiful ball game, allowing but three bingles. Two of these were enough to beat him, as Peabody doubled, and Bradsher followed with another to score the former with the winning run. Bunting and Hicks got the Deacs’ only two hits, and Morrison, Peabody, and Bradsher made safeties for the ‘Cats. It was undoubtedly a pitchers’ duel throughout, with Pearce spiking the big guns that had played such a large part in Wake Forest's five previous victories over Big Five teams. In a previous meeting of the two teams, the Deacons trimmed the Wildcats 4 to 1, when a third-inning bunting spree gave them a three-run lead.is still leading the race with six games won and one lost, and a win over Duke will virtually assure them of the state championship, but an underdog team from Davidson College ruined a perfect season for them, by taking them into camp 1 to 0.

Davidson Wildcats Lose To Blue Devils 10 to 2

The Duke Blue Devils defeated the Davidson Wildcat nine last Wednesday in Durham by the score of 10 to 2. This is the fifth game the “Cats have lost in the Big Five while they have won only one. Tim McKeithan, for the Blue Devils, was in excellent form for the contest and pitched his best game this season. McKeithan allowed only two bases on balls and two hits, and struck out 11 men during the contest. Croker, of the Wildcats, allowed 11 hits, including a double and a triple, and walked eight men. Mathis, Davidson right fielder, collected three of the four hits given by McKeithan and accounted for one of the Wildcats’ runs. West, who relieved Croker in the eighth inning, stopped the Blue Devils after they had scored two runs on Croker.
