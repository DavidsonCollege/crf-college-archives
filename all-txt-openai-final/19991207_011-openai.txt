Wookies Flickerball ’99

Somewhere between the NFL and the Pee Wee Leagues lies Flickerball, a tradition so uniquely Davidson that if you try
explaining it to anyone outside the college community, you always get an incredulous “Uh?” Even if nobody else in the
world knows about flickerball, that’s okay. As long as the sun continues to shine on our IMAC fields (and sometimes
even if it rains), there will be flickerball.

Below are the tournament brackets for this season’s flickerball leagues. Accompanying each bracket is a picture of that league’s champion.
The next time you see these classmates in the hallway, just try to juke past them without giving them the
congratulations they deserve...
