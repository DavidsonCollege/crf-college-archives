**THE DAVIDSONIAN NEWS**

Mary Lee of the Davidsonian recently spoke with Officer Stan Moore of Davidson’s Campus Safety and Police Office about his
job as a police officer at Davidson.

**The Davidsonian:** How long have you worked at Davidson and what did you do before?

**Officer Moore:** I have worked at Davidson for close to six years. Before, I was a military policeman, stationed at
Fort Bragg and twice in Germany. Then Davidson gave me an offer in the civilian police force, and I came
here.

**D:** What differences have you seen in terms of crime levels during your six years here?

**M:** Crime has definitely gone down because of our incorporation of cars, rather than Cushmans, and our great personnel. Also,
the environment is very good. The students and faculty have been more observant and will call us with any suspicious
activity.

**D:** What is the part you love most about your job?

**M:** The environment is good. I like working with different people.

**D:** What is the thing you like least about your job?

**M:** Probably the misconceptions. A lot of people think we are security guards. In actuality, we are sworn policemen.

**D:** What does Davidson's crime scene primarily consist of?

**M:** Our biggest problem is bicycle thefts. Sometimes they are just “ride-offs” (when students mistake another student’s bike for their
own) that turn up later. But students should make a conscious effort to lock their bikes. Other problems are larceny,
damage to property, and vandalism. But we can never know if they are internal or external problems.

**D:** Do you enjoy the college campus environment?

**M:** It took some adjusting from military police to campus police work, but I see myself staying here for now.

**D:** What does a typical day on-duty look like?

**M:** I come in and make sure the buildings are secure. Then I take care of any needed escorts. Each
shift, there is at least one fire or burglar alarm, usually false. Seventy-five percent of the time, I am in
the car, but we are trying to get out more on foot. This summer we started a bike patrol.

**D:** What are your hobbies or interests?

**M:** My primary interest is physical fitness. I am a personal trainer and work with candidates at the Sheriff's Academy
of Mecklenburg County and CPCC to get them physically fit.

**D:** What does a typical day’s workout consist of?

**M:** I run a few miles with the candidates in the morning. Then lift weights at Baker or the local
YMCA in the afternoon. If I have any clients for personal training, I also work out with them.

**D:** What do you think of your nickname of “Hightower?”

**M:** I’ve gotten used to it. Some people think it is my real name. They call me Officer Hightower. Some
of the other officers don’t like it, because they think we should be called by our official names. But I’ve
gotten used to it.

**D:** Did you ever play basketball?

**M:** Yes, I played in high school and for a semi-professional team in the Army.

**D:** Do you have any advice to students?

**M:** Make sure to lock your bikes up and report any suspicious activities. Contact the police right away. Make us
aware, so we can check it out immediately. Also, single females should be careful about walking around alone at night.
It always makes me nervous to see that. I'd like to see more people get involved in the RAD (Rape,
Aggression, Defense) program that we sponsor. We teach courses in basic self-defense to women. The biggest problem is getting the
word out to students.

**D:** Anything else you want Davidson students to know about you?

**M:** People think I am the big ticket writer. I just wanted to clear up that misconception and say that
we write equally around here.

**Commons to refund one of two deducted meals**

**SGA to conclude investigation at tonight’s meeting**

By Jessica Goodson, News Editor

One of two meals deducted from the plans of Vail Commons patrons during the inaugural festivities will be refunded. The
SAC to Auxiliary Services chair Foster Haselden, in conjunction with Dining Services staff, will determine which week the meal will
be added.

The SAC investigated the method of payment for the two inaugural meals in response to the resolution presented by senior
class president Tim Saintsing on October 14. A printed summary of the investigation will be submitted to the SGA meeting
tonight at 9:00 p.m.

The resolution charged the council to not only investigate why none of the Patterson Court houses helped fund the meals,
but whether plan-holders would be refunded for the two meals. Vail Commons Manager Barbara Metzler said that, of the two
meals deducted, the value of one was used to finance the pre-inaugural dinner on October 2. The other meal’s value
was held in a fund for the Inaugural Committee. But according to Committee chair Leland Park, funding from Vail Commons
was not utilized. The Committee—not the Commons—paid for the catered luncheon on Friday, October 3. This meal was ostensibly free
for everyone in attendance.

Metzler agreed that if the money which was set aside was not used by the Committee then it could be
refunded to plan-holders. Many plan-holders—mainly freshmen and independents—did not notice the reduction in meals for the week or were aware
of it.Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

and simply adjusted. But because the pre-inaugural dinner was solely paid for by the Dining Services, some plan-holders are still
perturbed over the loss of both meals. They had no voice in deciding where their money was allocated. In the
future, she said she plans to communicate better beforehand to avoid miscommunication over meals. “The intent was simply for the
dinner to be a great affair for the President presented by the students,” said Metzler. Park reminded students that no
plan-holder, upon realization that they had two fewer meals than expected, was denied access to the Commons. In practice, every
student that anticipated two free meals got just that. Metzler said that only 17 students expressed displeasure about the missing
meals. “We got the most complaints at Saturday lunch,” she said. “Eight people were waived through as guests on the
counter pass. One student received a cash refund. No one was turned away.” “We want students to have a good
experience with their Dining Service,” said Metzler. “Sometimes we even add meals at a loss to Vail Commons, especially around
exam time: the midnight breakfast, for example. Student funds always go back to the students.”

College growth causes controversy
Students, administrators speak up for maintenance of ‘intimacy’
By Laura CRAVER
Staff Writer

Since Davidson admitted its first handful of students, the College has prided itself on the personal attention that its small
size fosters. Students, faculty, and friends of Davidson consistently rank “intimacy” as one of the College’s best attributes. However, in
1957, the College, already feeling the effects of the Baby Boom, found itself in danger of abandoning its beloved “small
size.” The Davidsonian reported the controversy in a series of articles. The Trustees favored a gradual increase in enrollment from
a starting point of 850 students. According to one trustee who supported the expansion plan, “We must meet the demands
of a growing student population if Davidson College is to continue to serve the Church.” Furthermore, Davidson’s registrar at the
time, F. W. Hengeveld, dismissed claims that the quality of education would drop with increased enrollment. “If we have the
facilities and the staff, the College can do just as good a job with a larger group as it can
with 850 students.”

However, negative reactions to the proposal were both numerous and vocal. Most were quick to defend the small size of
Davidson. “There is an intangible limit past which point the complexion and atmosphere of a small college begins to change,”
one student wrote in an editorial. “Davidson has now reached that point...but the Trustees have ordered the enrollment increased.” The
student also warned that “increased enrollment will also result in lower standards — based on the quality of students that
are currently applying for admission.” Faculty members also rallied in opposition to increased enrollment. “I personally believe that we can
do a better job with a smaller group and do it well,” Acting President Pietenpol said. Pietenpol went on to
add that the endowment stood at $8,000 per student, as compared with $30,000 per student that some Northern liberal arts
colleges had. He pointed out that an increase in enrollment would mean, of course, a decrease in the endowment per
student. Pietenpol also emphasized the benefits of small classes where individual instruction could be given. “When a class gets above
20 students, it may as well have 200 students,” he said. Spencer also expressed a desire to see Davidson concentrate
on raising the quality level of education, underscoring his belief in Davidson’s responsibility to its constituents “in terms of quality,
definitely not quantity.”

Another faculty member, Dr. Davidson, supported Davidson’s small size by offering two hypotheses in determining the relative value of size:
“If not at least one-third of the members of (the group) know each other, the body of students is under
the saturation point of a co-existential group; if not at least fifty percent of them who know each other also
like each other, the body of students is under the saturation point of personal attention and intimacy while a cohesive
group.” Davidson also chose to speak about the “intangible values” resulting from Davidson’s small college status. Among the values he
cited were the quality of student democracy, a religious concern, a respect for tradition, mutual trust, and good manners. “The
fact that (the values) are old stuff reveals that they are a part of the fabric of your beginning,” Davidson
said. Finally, a student editorial presented a question of motive, posing the question, “Could the real motive be to put
Davidson College on a competitive basis in big-time athletics?” “If so, we are proud of Davidson as she now is,”
Davidson said. Nevertheless, change was inevitable, and the College began its gradual expansion plan by enrolling 890 students for the
fall semester of 1958. Today, enrollment lingers around 1600 students, nearly twice as many as 40 years ago. Yet Davidson
remains relatively small in size, retaining the benefits of admitting students of superior quality.
