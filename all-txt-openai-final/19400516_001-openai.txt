R.O.T.C. Unit Wins Mark Of Excellent

University of Tennessee Major Inspects

Davidson's R.O.T.C. unit was awarded the grade of excellent at the annual inspection held last Friday, May 10, in Richardson
Stadium. Physical drill, directed by Cadet Major Sam Spencer, was the first item on the program of the afternoon. This
was followed by a regular special parade, with the battalion reviewed by the Davidson battalion staff. At this time, the
group went through a special parade in honor of the inspecting officer, Major Hyde of the University of Tennessee. The
battalion passed in review before Major Hyde and Davidson’s Lieutenant Colonel MacKenzie.

Immediately following the second parade, the regular inspection took place. The inspecting officer, accompanied by Cadet Colonel J. C. Cooper,
Cadet Major S. R. Spencer, and Lieutenant Colonel MacKenzie, passed through the ranks of each company. The inspector stopped before
several men in each company and asked various questions. These questions consisted of such things as the commander of Davidson's
battalion, the president of the college, the commander of the corps area, and other items for which the student is
expected to be responsible.

After the actual inspection, the various companies proceeded to do their individual projects. Company A, under Cadet Captain S. R.
Oglesby, gave a demonstration of company close order drill. Company B, under Cadet Captain John Kennedy, staged the mock battle
problem on the golf course. The project was under the direction of Lieutenant Colonel Steel. Company C, of which D.
C. Colvin is cadet captain, gave a demonstration of platoon close (Continued on Page Six)

Rich Student Makes Direct Inter-Fraternity Sing Comedy Shows

Luther Made Senior Marshal; Bumbarger Heads Publications Board

Elections ended last week with the Publications Board election and the selection of marshals for graduation exercises. Winston Taylor, Andy
Dale, and Paul Bumbarger were elected to the Publications Board. These men were elected by the student body from six
eligibles, including the two managers of each publication. This year the three editors of the publications won the elections over
the three business managers.

Chosen Monday

The board, meeting Monday night, selected Paul Bumbarger president, Winston Taylor vice-president, and Andy Dale secretary. Charlie Luther was elected
Friday to the post of Senior marshal to lead the graduation procession on June 3rd. Those eligible for this office
were the junior marshals of last year.

Junior Marshals

Joe Shelton, Russell Edmonson, Bob Reinhardt, and Holt Barnwell have been elected from the junior class to become junior marshals.
They will remain on the campus during graduation to usher at the graduation exercises.

CHARLIE LUTHER

Athletic Day May 20

Athletic Day will be held in chapel on next Monday, May 20. This is an annual event at which all
fraternity, dormitory, and individual awards for athletic excellence for the past year are made. Also to be given are the
shingles of those who made letters in all sports except football, as they have already been given out. These presentations
will be made by members of the faculty and alumni.

Win In Final Ballots

Book Written By Two Betas

A history of Davidson's chapter of Beta Theta Pi, authored by Bob Ramsey and Albert Winn, is now being printed
in Charlotte and is scheduled to appear on Monday, May 20. The book will total 128 pages in conventional book
format. Stiff binding will be used. The cover will be maroon with gold lettering.

Many members and alumni of the Phi Alpha aided with the preparation of the history, which bears the title “Milestones
Backward Run,” taken from a familiar Beta song. Professor Chalmers Davidson, a faculty brother, assisted with copy-reading and proof correction.

The book traces the history of Davidson’s oldest Greek brotherhood from its founding here in 1858 up to the present
time. It is the result of much research into fraternity and college archives, and is, so far as can be
determined, the only history of a Beta chapter written by undergraduates to date.

Occasion for the history's publication is the fiftieth anniversary of Phi Alpha’s continuous existence on the Davidson campus. The first
Beta chapter was killed by Civil War and was not revived until 1890.

First Fraternity Sing Will Be Held Tonight On Steps Of Chambers

Nine Fraternities to Compete Vocally for Silver Loving Cup

Honor Awards Presented

Pfohl, Robinson, Riker, Dickenshertz to Judge

Davidson's nine national fraternities will inaugurate their annual inter-fraternity sing tonight at 8:30 on the steps of Chambers Building. Professor
J. C. Pfohl, head of the music department, will be in charge of the affair, and Dr. Kenneth J. Foreman
will preside as master of ceremonies. Judges for the event will be Professor Pfohl, Professor Robinson, Professor Riker, and Professor
Dickenshertz. The winning fraternity will be awarded a silver loving cup, donated by the music department.

The fraternities will be judged on originality, ability to sing, arrangements of songs, direction, and tone. Fraternities will appear in
the following order: Pi Kappa Alpha, Phi Gamma Delta, Phi Delta Theta, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Kappa Alpha, Pi Kappa Phi,
Sigma Phi Epsilon, Beta Theta Pi, Kappa Sigma. At the conclusion of the sing, Professor Pfohl will present the cup.

Masquers Will Present Burlesque Monday

What would you do if you entered a small Presbyterian college for gentlemen, and your father promised the school a
new gymnasium provided you pledged a fraternity—any fraternity! Such is the plight (farcially speaking) of Victor Pendleton Lincoln Arthur III,
in the forthcoming Red and Black Masquers’ farce, “Solomon Without Wives.”

Playing opposite V. P. L. Arthur is Vivian I. Hee, who portrays the romantic heroine. The third lead, Roscoe, Vic's
roomie, is played by Hans Deutsch. These three parts will be played by Pat Rudolph, Joe Robinson, and Dick Cobb,
respectively. Other characters are: Dr. Abbott, dean of the small Presbyterian college, to be played by Bill Summers; Dr. Consonants,
German prof, to be played by Boyd Flynn; and Chambers, associate professor of bibliographical history (which I believe is a
burlesque on the Davidson faculty), to be played by Charlie Luther.

Twenty-three Cadets Given Special Recognition

Cadet Major Samuel R. Spencer, First Sergeant John Hay, and Cadet Private George D. Horan received the medals of the
best senior cadet, best junior cadet, and best drilled freshman, respectively, at the last drill of the year which was
held Monday, May 13. Presentation of medals annually takes place at this time, and the majority of the awards are
kept secret until the time of their bestowal. At this time, Cadet Major Spencer was awarded the medal for the
best-drilled cadet in the battalion. The platoon, under Cadet First Lieutenant Beecher W. Sitterson.

Medals were presented to the members of the rifle team for excellence in marksmanship. Receiving these medals were: Cadet Captain
Walter E. Kunz, Cadet First Sergeant P. H. Holt, Cadet Sergeant W. J. Bolin, Cadet Sergeant William R. Eagan, Cadet
Corporals R. E. Ballard andJohn S. says he teaches a Russian Literature class. Retreats from apathy: The Davidson Symphony Band,
under the direction of Mr. Pfohl, will give a concert. The plot centers around Vic, who is rushed by every
fraternity, naturally, but who conceals his identity, or something. Then Miss Vamp enters the scene, etcetera, etcetera. The scenes are
laid at The Little Wreck, the small college town's local restaurant; the fraternity lodge of Upsilon Upsilon Upsilon; and a
room in Linger Dormitory. In The Little Wreck, one of the three original songs, "Take It or Leave It," is
sung by Nellie, the waitress, to be played by Ed Jackson. To give you an idea of the songs, "Take
It or Leave It" opens like this:

Take it or leave it.
After all, you can't live without it.

The production was written by Dan Hodges and Joe Robinson, and will be presented Monday night, May 20, in Chambers
auditorium. Every bad sense of humor is cordially invited.
