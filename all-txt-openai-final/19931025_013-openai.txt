Movie Review

The Joy Luck Club drives everyone (but Scott) to tears

By Scott McLean

Hey fellow movie-goers! I hope everyone had a great Fall Break and perhaps used the opportunity to relax and see a good flick. As for me, I ventured into the theaters once again, expecting the worst and ready for one-on-one combat with yet another stinker—I was prepared to enter the dragon for the sake of Davidsonian readers everywhere. I thought that The Age of Innocence had filled my good movie quota for the semester and I would be doomed to see D-grade flicks for the rest of the year. However, I was pleasantly surprised and then some with this week's fare, The Joy Luck Club—when it rains, it pours, I guess.

Adapted from the novel by Amy Tan (she also co-wrote the screenplay and shares producer credit), this is the story of four Chinese women who immigrated to San Francisco and their daughters who were raised in America. Although it sounds like a set-up for a really sappy film, let me assure you that it is 99% sap-free. In fact, I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that it is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Here's the scenario: Aunties Lindo, An-mei, Ying-Ying, and Suyuan have gathered together weekly for the past thirty years to play mah-jongg and in the process, have become entangled in each other's lives and have shared their stories of hardships in China.

When Suyuan passes away, her daughter June (Ming-na Wen, who gives a stellar performance in her first big-screen role) is invited to take her place at the game table. It is here that she learns that her two sisters who had been abandoned by her mother beside a road in China have been located. This begins a series of vignettes in which she recalls some key moments in her life involving her mother. The stories of the aunties and their daughters are told in like fashion, examining the different kinds of mother-daughter relationships in the process. This may sound rather bland, but the humor and compassion with which these stories are told give each one a spark and keep you glued to the screen waiting to find out what has happened in the lives of these women. This movie is on the long side (over two hours), but I never looked at my watch once-- that's saying a lot for a film these days. It's a credit to Tan who has managed to present what might otherwise have been a rather confusing story very clearly without losing any of the feeling. I say this is definitely one worth checking out--but one warning, though: it's a five hankie tearjerker. When I saw it the whole theater was sobbing by the end of the movie (except for me, of course), so you might want to bring a few extra Puffs along with you.

Well, I guess that wraps it up for this week. Until next time...

Tales of a campus ghost

Ghost continued from page 11

landed not on the stairs below, but in the hall corner some way away. Dr. Marcon suddenly said she felt “in danger,” and left immediately in a fright. Commenting later on her experience, Dr. Marcon said “all I can say is that after the things happened while I was there I never went back.” She plainly feels that whatever happened, it was caused by a presence of some kind, referring to it as a “thing.” “I think that the thing is either anti-Christian or more specifically, anti-Catholic,” she stated, “because I was talking about religious topics (saints and angels) at the time it started disrupting our conversation.” Apparently, not only have Marshall and Marcon experienced these phenomena. After Dr. Marshall moved out, another visiting professor and writer-in-residence moved in and had the same problems, including footstep noises and the shockingly cold spot in the hall.

So what to make of all this? Most of us, as critically thinking, rational individuals, can surely assign logical explanations for these occurrences. Or can we? If one Davidson professor can’t explain them and another ran in sheer fear from it, perhaps we too would find ourselves at a loss. Maybe there’s a ghost in Harding House. Maybe there’s not.

This article was compiled using telephone and e-mail interviews with Dr. Bonnie Marshall and Dr. Becky Marcon.
