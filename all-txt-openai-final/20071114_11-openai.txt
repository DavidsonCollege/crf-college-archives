Men’s Swimming claims first win, Women stumble

By PATRICK DEVISSCHER

After a slow start, men’s swimming came up with its first dual meet victory of the season. However, despite some
great swimming from Lindsey Martin ’11, the women could not add to their streak of three dual meet wins. With
the meet, the men improved to 1-4 overall and the women fell to 3-3.

Merrit Peele ’09 was a key contributor for the men this weekend, winning the 100, 200, and 1,000 freestyle events.
Peele’s time of 1:43.82 in the 200 was his best of the season, while his other wins came with times
of 48.50 in the 100 and 9:53.10 in the 1,000. Other outstanding performances included Miller Williams’s ’10 win in the
100 fly, while Scott Frantz ’09 had his best time of the season in the 100 back by finishing the
event in 52.44. The last individual title for the men came from Will Broughton’s ’08 time of 4:51.65 in the
500 freestyle.

The Wildcat men were also successful in their team events, winning the 200 medley and 200 free relay events. Fiete
Stegger ’08, Williams, Frantz, and Andrew Carlson ’09 finished the medley with an impressive time of 1:36.95. With a winning
time of 1:29.07 in the free relay, Miguel Rodriguez ’09, Tennant Brastow ’11, and Patrick Whitman ’11 proved that the
'Cats have what it takes to perform in the CCSA.

Despite improving upon her school record with a time of 23.71 in the 50 free, Martin and the women’s team
lost to a talented Gardner Webb squad. Fellow classmate of Martin’s, Anna Stringfield ’11, won the 400 individual medley with
a time of 4:35.20. The last win for the lady Wildcats came in the 200 freestyle relay thanks to key
performances by Emily Castle ’11, Caitlin Sheetz ’10, and Jessica Delgehausen ’11. The team recorded a time of 1:41.48.

Both the women’s and men’s teams should build on the positive momentum from last weekend’s meet. A home meet this
weekend will provide a great platform to do so. The Wildcats are set to host the Davidson Invitational at the
Cannon pool. The meet starts at 1 p.m. on Friday.

Wrestling starts season strong at UNC Pembroke

The Wildcat wrestling team started its season strong with several wrestlers recording multiple wins and three freshmen recording their first
collegiate victories. Trebor Clavette ’08 stood tallest of all the Wildcats, finishing second in the 174 lb. weight class. He
won four consecutive matches before narrowly falling in the championship match 8-7 to Randy Oates of George Mason.

Ben Altman ’10 and Sam O’Hair ’09 recorded fourth place finishes in the 125 and 184 classes, respectively. Altman rode
a three-match winning streak into the semifinals before losing to eventual champion Matthew Oliver. O’Hair also won three matches before
falling in the quarterfinals. O’Hair recovered nicely, however, winning four matches in the Wrestleback bracket before coming up short in
the third-place match.

Mike Waters ’10 made it to the quarterfinals in the 197 lb. weight class. Vitali Radsky ’11 recorded four victories
in the 125 lb. class in the Wrestleback bracket before losing in the semifinals. His twin brother Alex ’11 won
a match in 133, and Joe McGinley ’11 won two matches in the Wrestleback bracket in 149. Charlie Wolff ’11
added a victory in the heavyweight division. The victories were the first of the four freshmen’s careers.

“Overall we competed tough at every weight class, but there were a lot of little mistakes we all made that
cost us a lot of matches,” Clavette said. “It was a good tune-up tournament for us.”

The next match for the Wildcats will be the Navy Classic on Nov. 17.

The volleyball team picked up two critical conference wins away at Appalachian State 3-2 and at home againstGeorgia Southern 3-1.
Sarabeth Peele ’11 led the team against Appalachian State with 22 kills. Other key contributors were Katie Pierucci ’08 who
tallied 14 kills, Kittery Neale ’09 who added 13, and Tierney Hodge ’09 who hit 10. The win snapped the
Mountaineers' 11-match winning streak. The first game swung back and forth between teams with the score tied as late as
22-22. Appalachian State pulled ahead for the narrow 30-25 win. The second game again stayed tight until the Wildcats turned
the tables on the Mountaineers by securing 12 of the last 15 points in the game, winning 30-21. The third
game proved the same story, as the teams traded the lead often. With the score tied at 27, team leader
Pierucci stepped up to the challenge, stringing together three straight kills to win the game 30-27. While the Wildcats lost
the fourth game 30-27, the ’Cats overcame an early 2-0 deficit in the fifth game to pull away for a
15-12 victory that secured the match. Appropriately, Pierucci was the star on Senior Day against Georgia Southern, racking up 24
kills and 20 digs in the 3-1 match. Fellow seniors Courtney Cron, Nicole Keroack, and Lindsey Woeste were honored before
the game. Neale added 16 kills to the effort while Hayley Lawson ’11 distributed 51 assists. The combination of Peele,
Lawson, and Neale supporting Keroack’s skillful serving put the ’Cats up 4-1 early in the match. Although Davidson lost the
lead briefly, two kills by Neale vaulted the team back into the lead and gave the Wildcats the 30-24 win.

Jordan Benedict ’11 led the team with six blocks against the Eagles on Sunday. Pierucci and Keroack saved game two
for the ’Cats with strong serving to put the ’Cats up 10-7 after early struggles. The score knotted at 23-23,
but the ’Cats pulled away for the 30-26 win with the help of kills from Pierucci and a series of
Eagle errors. After game three went to the Eagles, the Wildcats fought hard to claim the match in game four.
With the game tied 21-21, Peele’s serve sparked a 4-0 run to give the ’Cats a 24-21 lead. Although Georgia
Southern fought until the end, the Wildcats won the deciding match 30-27. Because of its conference wins, Davidson will be
ranked as the seventh seed in the upcoming SoCon Tournament in Chattanooga. The Wildcats’ first opponent will be Appalachian State,
who they hope to beat for the second time in as many weeks.

By Patrick McArdle, Sports Editor

The men’s cross country team ran fast enough for a 25th place finish at the NCAA Southeast Regionals, while the
women’s team claimed 16th place in the event. On the women’s side, Caroline Sanker ’09 finished a phenomenal season by
earning all-region honors for her 24th place finish at the event. Her achievement, running the race in a time of
21:20.90, makes her the first all-region cross country athlete in Davidson history. Behind Sanker, Megal Atias ’11 finished in 80th
place with a time of 22:15.65, and Annie O’Donnell placed 97th with a time of 22:31.60. On the men’s side,
Tom Divinnie ’10 finished the 10K race in 33:11.50 which landed him in 120th place. Alex Hoyt ’09 ran the
race in 33:27.65, good enough for 129th place. Thad Sieracki ’09 came in just behind at 33:28.10 for 130th and
Sam Morris ’08 finished the race in 33:32.75 for a 137th place finish. The men’s team only dropped one spot
overall from last year’s finish despite having lost its top three runners.
