The men's track team traveled to the Wake Forest Invitational this past weekend, competing against 22 other schools in what has become an annual highlight of the Wildcat schedule. Fueled by a number of strong performances (including many personal records), the men turned out yet another exceptional team effort highlighted by one broken school record and another record barely missed.

Assistant coach Travis Erickson reflected on the invitational: “It was a great meet considering the hard week of training we just had. We’re still a little banged up right now with injuries and illnesses, but we’re looking forward to more great performances in the next few weeks.”

Junior Brent Ferrell broke his own school record in the 3000m Saturday running 8:40.45 to place 12th overall at the meet. In what has become near-habit for Ferrell, another college best was lowered by the best distance runner in Wildcat track and field history. His classmate Pat Burchett also recorded an impressive finish, covering the distance in 8:53.85, one of the school’s top ten times ever and a personal record for Burchett by nearly 10 seconds. “I was especially pumped about my own PR, but it was exciting to see so many other guys do as well as they did,” said Burchett. Thomas McElveen added to the duo’s strong performances by running a solid 9:14.36.

The sprint corp was represented with some great races as well, with senior Gray Austin starting off Friday as the lone Cat 100m runner, finishing in 11.55. Roland Williams led the team in the 200m (:23.21), while Addam Marcotte (:23.48) and Michael Albert (:23.68) also competed and finished with superb times. Grant Bleecher sprinted his way to a :53.60 in the 400m, with Jay Jahnes just behind him in a 53.66. Ade Artis continued his strong season in the triple jump, recording a best jump of 43' during the meet. John Moore threw for a personal record (139'6") in the javelin, which placed him among the school’s top ten best throws ever.

Co-Captain Stan Baker also continued his string of early season breakthroughs as he ran the 400m hurdles in :61.85, lowering his time from last week’s meet and inching closer to his personal record. Paul Irwin competed for the men in the 5000m, recording a 16:02.15 in the process and establishing his own personal record. Jay Jahnes rebounded from his disappointing 400m by running a personal record of his own in the 800m (1:59.27), with Keith Chapman (1:59.94) and senior Davey Bacon (2:00.29) just behind him in a tight finish. This triumvirate, in addition to freshman Dan Gibson, will represent the men in the 4x800m relay next week and attempt to break yet another Wildcat school record.

The rookie sensation made his own bid for a school record in Winston Salem, falling just short despite an incredible sprint to the finish. His time of 3:59.51 in the 1500m Friday (11th place) narrowly missed the school record of 3:58.9, but showed that Gibson is primed for a strong leg in the relay next week and continued his impressive first year. Thomas McElveen and Keith Gordon ran 4:15.30 and 4:18.43, respectively, for the men in the same event. Scott Hutchins was the lone ‘Cat 3000m steeplechase competitor, finishing his race in 11:05.66.

The 4x100m relay team of Stan Baker, Michael Albert, Addam Marcotte, and Roland Williams sprinted their way to a :44.75, finishing in 10th place overall. In what became another exciting race of the weekend, the 4x400m relay team of Roland Williams, Davey Bacon, Keith Chapman, and Michael Albert slashed through the competition with the fastest time at Davidson College since the 1985 outdoor season, finishing in 3:26.40 and taking home 13th place in the meet. Their time put them among the top three teams on the Southern Conference Performance list at this point in the season, but the team can only hope to improve on that awesome performance.

The men hope to continue this string of success next weekend at the Raleigh Relays at North Carolina State University. There they will again compete against some of the best competition in the South, including many great ACC teams. Ferrell commented on the upcoming meets.by saying, “It is ridiculous how much potential we have.”

Undefeated Wildcats tearing up Southern Conference

After over an hour of intense play and even more intense bickering over line calls, sophomore Whit Hansen put away Georgia Southern’s #2 singles player (a twenty-three-year-old “freshman”), and with that, Davidson’s men’s tennis team (13-5) jumped out to a 5-0 conference record, their best conference start in two years. The Georgia Southern win comes after vital, hard-fought victories over College of Charleston and UNC-Greensboro.

“To be 5-0 at this point in the season and to have beat College of Charleston and UNC-Greensboro is a pleasant surprise,” Coach Frank said. “Guys are really getting pumped up for conference play.”

With the doubles being erratic all season, the Wildcats’ singles play has been stellar. “We’ve scrambled to win the match with singles even after we’ve lost the doubles,” Frank explained, “but our singles have been excellent.” Sophomore Billy Boykin, after being sidelined by injuries early in the season, has gone undefeated against Southern Conference opponents at #5 singles. The #2, #3, #4, and #6 singles have also amassed a combined 16-4 record in the conference.

Coach Frank cited the strong play of Hansen as a major factor in the ‘Cats’ success. Only a sophomore, Hansen is playing #2 singles after debuting at #5 singles his freshman year. According to Frank, he has handled the move up “very well” and has given the team several solid performances, including a key victory at UNC-Greensboro that solidified the squad’s 5-2 win.

Although the Wildcats are assured of their twenty-seventh winning season in as many years, they would like to enter the conference tournament undefeated as they did two years ago. To do so they will have to go through Furman, this Wednesday at home, and The University of Tennessee-Chattanooga, also a home match on Friday. Furman garnered first place in the Southern Conference last year, and UT-Chattanooga is the defending SC tournament champion, so the ‘Cats have their work cut out for them. However, Coach Frank believes the team is more than up to the task. “With the way we've been playing of late, there is no reason to believe that we cannot beat any of the five teams remaining on our schedule.”

After this week’s demanding matches, the team has two weaker opponents in VMI and Appalachian State and then finishes the regular season against East Tennessee State. This Wednesday’s match against Furman is also senior day and Frank knows that there is no better way to say good-bye to his five seniors than an undefeated conference record and a solid performance in the conference tournament.
