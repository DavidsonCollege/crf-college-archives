**Davidsonian—March 14, 1980**

**Sports Scripts**

**Basketball**

The Lady Wildcats closed the regular season on a winning note by thrashing Furman 72-58 and seemed to have ample
momentum heading into the AIAW Division II State Tournament; but in first-round play, Davidson was ousted by Methodist 83-57.

The tournament, which was held in Greensboro, offered the Wildcats the perfect opportunity to avenge an earlier one-point loss at
the hands of Methodist. Davidson, however, could not put together a team effort and was outplayed at both ends of
the floor.

Sara Womack paced the Wildcats with 17 points in her final appearance in the “red and white” while freshman Mike
Frankhouser yanked down 11 rebounds. Womack was named to the All-State team for the second successive year. —VAN BECK

**Wrestling**

The Davidson Wrestling team closed out its season with the Southern Conference Championship, held February 29 and March 1 in
Charleston, S.C. Rob King placed second in the heavyweight division and Scott Smith garnered fourth at 134 lbs. as the
team finished sixth in a seven-team field.

Earlier, on February 23, the ‘Cats lost a dual match to a powerful Appalachian State team, 51-12. The only points
Davidson could muster came from two forfeits.

Commenting on the season, Coach Bob Estock said he was “very pleased with the seven wrestlers who finished the season.
They put out all the time.” Estock had praise for Captains Rob King and Mick Garfinkel, “the leadership Mike and
Rob gave to the young wrestlers was excellent, in all respects.” On King’s performance, Estock said, “To come back from
a serious knee injury, as Rob did, and place second in the Southern Conference is a fine honor.”

With seven wrestlers returning next year, Coach Estock is looking forward to a “much improved season.” —DAVID DONALDSON

**Track**

Davidson trackmen completed the indoor portion of their schedule with a competition hosted by UNC-CH on February 16 and the
Southern Conference Championships a week later held at East Tennessee State University.

Davidson competed with three strong track schools—Wake Forest, UNC, and North Carolina Central—in the first meet and several Cat athletes
ran well. John Hoots shattered the Davidson indoor mile record with a 4:21 clocking which placed him fifth overall. Dick
Jones finished second and fourth in the 600-yard dash and 60-yard high hurdles respectively while Robert Frierson garnered fourth in
the 880 with a fine 2:04.

The Conference meet at ETSU was somewhat of a disappointment for Davidson participants but solid efforts were recorded by Dick
Jones in the 600-yard dash, John Hoots at 1000 yards, Terrazzo Wallace in the 60-yard sprint, Robert Frierson in the
880, and Alec Driscoll in the triple jump. —VAN BECK
