Martian Men Startle Audience In Radio Skit

Unique Program Strikes Fear To Hearts Of Davidson Students

A startling and grim dramatization of H. G. Wells’ play, “The War of the Worlds,” struck stark terror into the hearts of many Davidson students here last Sunday night. Many of the students didn't realize that the play was a dramatization of pure fiction and rushed frantically to the rooms of other boys declaring that the world was coming to an end. Other boys joined them in their fears or either uselessly tried to explain that the announcements coming in over the radio were from a fiction play and that there was no real danger at all. Several dropped to their knees and began to pray before the broadcast was over.

A group of Davidson students returning from Asheville and listening to what they thought were news radio bulletins kneeled beside their car on the road to pray fervently along with other people who had stopped their cars. Calls were made over the telephones by terrified boys to parents who were far away to assure themselves that their families were safe from the intrusions of the “men from Mars.” Even a few of the professors were frightened during the program and it has been reported that the wife of one of the professors fainted while listening to the realistic tragedy portrayed in the dramatization, although CBS states that it was announced four times during the program that the dramatization was purely fictional.

Many students and other people were greatly indignant when the hubbub subsided and it was learned by many who had been so terror-stricken that the reports which they had heard were from a fiction play being dramatized by Orson Welles on “The Mercury Theater of the Air.” Senator Clyde L. Herring, Democrat from Iowa, was so indignant that he said he planned to introduce a bill in Congress “controlling just such abuses as was heard over the radio last night. Radio has no more right to present programs like that than has someone in knocking on your door and screaming,” he added.

Pre-Med Club Makes Plans

Alpha Delta Epsilon, honorary pre-medical fraternity, held its second meeting this year in the Sigma Alpha Epsilon house at eight o'clock last Wednesday night. The program consisted of a discussion of the subject, “Socialized Medicine.” The topic, which is being given considerable attention by the American Medical Association, was presented in its various phases by Bill Boyce, Bob Doty, Alec Erwin, Jr., and Bobby Gish. All aspects of the subject were considered and a conclusion, unfavorable to socialized medicine, was made. After the discussion, which was attended by prospective pledges, a short business meeting was held. An invitation had been received by Dr. Lyon from the Biology Club at Winthrop College and plans were discussed to present a program there sometime in the near future. After deciding to send formal bids for membership, refreshments were served.

Old Japanese Relics Shown

Orientals Observe Peculiar Religious Customs

The library has a timely exhibit of Japanese sacred relics which the Davidson College English Department brought back with him from his trip to the Orient in the summer of 1937. They include such relics as chopsticks made from the sacred wood of a temple which had been torn down, prayers, priests’ prayer beads, a map of Koyasan, the most famous mountain in Japan, miniature Buddhas, and many other objects of interest. Another relic is the temple stamp, of which there are many on exhibit. These stamps are imprinted on prayer books by priests at the various temples to indicate that the owner of the prayer book has made a pilgrimage to that shrine.

Holy Places

Lilly visited many noted places holy in the Oriental eye, the most famous of which are located at Koya-san, Kyoto, Yamato-Ise, Hiei-zan, and Hangchow. There are relics from these shrines in the exhibit. Koya-san, a sacred mountain of Japan, is said to have had thousands of glittering temples in its prime and is the goal of thousands of pilgrims every year. Kyoto, one of the more important cities in Japan, is noted for its many religious festivals. Yamato-Ise is a favorite shrine of the followers of Shintoism, the national religion of the Japanese. Hiei-zan is the monastery of the Tendai sect, one of the oldest sects established in Japan that bears the same relationship to the various forms of Protestantism.

In one of the valleys near Hangchow is a monastery founded in the third century. It was erected in 260 A.D. by a Buddhist monk from the Indian monastery of Ling Yin Monastery. There are some of the oldest relics of Hangchow kept, including carved Buddhas dating back to the sixth century. At one of the shrines is a pavilion having the Temple of the Kings of Heaven.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

of course someone had to come up afterwards with the announcement that “they could have done better.” My guess is that “Fed-Up” is some disgruntled Senior because he was not chosen himself. All of us will admit that conditions between the faculty and the students could be improved. But they can never be improved while some members of the student body are sticking anonymous knives in the backs of our chosen intermediaries.

Yours,
PAUL W. BUMBARGER, JR.

* * *

Dear Bill:

Now it's our turn to be mad. “Fed-Up” hadn’t any right to use a “we” for his and only his singular opinion. His widely distracted mind is that of an egoist who must have thought himself worthy of Omicron Delta Kappa and not the seven men we have chosen. “Fed-Up,” why didn’t you have the nerve to sign such an outlandish statement? I know why; the Davidson student body would have such an intense dislike for you that you couldn't stay in school. “Fed-Up,” the campus as a whole is tired of putting up with your sort of cynicism, and the sooner you leave the better. Can’t you take a hint; your sort is not wanted at Davidson.

Sincerely,
MACK OTTS,
R. J.

Character is what you are; reputation is what people think you are.

Group Meets To Debate On Mission Work

Musical Selections Rendered During Evening Program

On Sunday evening, October 30, the Sunday evening vesper service, held in Chambers Building, was led by the Rev. Mr. and Mrs. A. J. McElway of Pinehurst and the Rev. Mr. and Mrs. H. V. Gibson of Santa Puna.

After their introduction by Dr. Lingle, the quartet, which is formed of the two ministers and their wives, sang a hymn. The hymn by the quartet was followed by a prayer made by the Rev. Mr. McElway, and the congregation then stood and sang “All Hail the Power of Jesus’ Name.” An offering was then taken, and an offertory prayer was offered by the Rev. Mr. Gibson.

Mr. McElway read a lesson which was found in Luke 14:25-33; this was immediately followed by a short hymn from the quartet. The Rev. Mr. McElway began a short sermon whose key verse may be found in Luke 14:25. Mr. McElway pointed out that as Christ talked to the multitudes in the valley, He was offering them His type of living, this type of living being the only way to true happiness.Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

There were several argu- is true, but He is pre- pared to put up a hard fight, for AMONG THE GREEKS French UC fort in this debate were as follows: Should mission work be carried on in Catholic countries? Is it the missionary’s job to civilize and improve social conditions? Is Initiation more important than Christian life? When Christ asks a man to accept His way of life, He knows that there are hardships, and He offers phase it as a challenge to anyone that is willing to with his family, while most of the brothers went to the game and their dance in Greenville.
