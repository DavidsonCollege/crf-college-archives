Strange Wildlife Abounds On Farm Near Davidson
By BILL GIDUZ
Staff Writer

Upon their first trip into Charlotte, many Davidson freshmen are somewhat unnerved by the sight of llamas or an occasional water buffalo grazing nonchalantly in a pasture on the left side of the road about a mile past the Wher-Rena Marina. Most students soon become accustomed to the sight of the unusual beasts, but a nagging curiosity as to the reason for their being lingers on.

The story is not really so mysterious: they are there simply because a 60-year-old man, John Cooke, enjoys raising them. “They were scarcer than they are now when I first started getting them. I just wanted to see what I could do with them, and I also knew where I could get them,” Cooke said. He went on to point out that the animals he raises aren’t that easy to come by. In addition to his five llamas and single buffalo, he has two regular buffalo, several half buffalo, eight shaggy Scotch highland cows, and some regular domestic cattle. His herd has always been changing since he purchased his first llamas and buffalo ten years ago. He has owned a yak and several elk which he has since traded or sold.

Profit is not Cooke's motive in keeping the animals. “I don’t have to have much to live on, if I did I’d be broke.” Some of the animals bring a handsome price, though. On the rather limited market, a female llama will bring $700, a male merely $200. His Indian water buffalo, which he obtained in Tennessee by trading an elk, would bring Cooke about $600 if he were to sell her. The water buffalo is the most temperamental member of the menagerie. She disappears into the thick brush for weeks at a time, emerging only when she gets hungry enough. Cooke commented that the water buffalo’s milk is supposed to be very rich, but he’s never confirmed that report.

Half buffalo, or cattle, are exactly that: half buffalo, half cattle. They are far from being the dumb animals many people may think them to be, however. Speaking of one in particular, Cooke said, “When she gets hungry she comes up to the barn and starts begging. You can hear her grunting.” They are also capable of simple tricks, and Cooke hopes to teach them some when he gets time.

To many people, llamas are fascinating creatures, and it is easy to see why upon close examination. They all have a very curious, intent look when a visitor approaches, and seem to think themselves above the other animals nearby. What do you do with five llamas in Huntersville, N.C.? At $700 per female, Mr. Cooke breeds and sells them. He explained that one man bought a llama as a pet for his grandchildren. In their native South America, their wool is used for clothing, but there aren’t many people in this area with an interest in weaving llama wool. Cooke does hope eventually to find someone willing to take on the job. “They don’t cost anything to keep, I just put out a little bit of grain every once in a while; they just live right on.”

Cooke has never had any real problem with his animals. A half buffalo escaped and was gone for four months when someone ran into his fence not long ago. It was spotted on several occasions, but no one ventured to try to stop the 1200-pound animal. “They claim she tore up fence and everything, but she never caused any trouble here.” Cooke went on to explain that the more the animals are handled, the tamer they become. “The buffalo will come into the barn just like a cow will.” All of his varied species get along well together on the 80-acre farm, but the horned animals will attack each other if they are stabled together. Cooke was once hauling a wild bull through downtown Memphis and the bull became restless because of his small enclosure and the unfamiliar surroundings. “Scared people to death,” Cooke said.

His neighbors are tolerant toward Cooke's hobby, but they aren't overly enthusiastic. Children enjoy the docile animals immensely, however, and school groups regularly view the exotic herd. Davidson students and anyone else driving Highway 21 to Charlotte can expect to see the animals every time they drive by. Cooke sees no termination of his “business”: he enjoys watching and raising them, and they seem to be perfectly content with their present home and company.

Night Attack On Coed**Sparks Discussion Of Campus Security**

**AN ANALYSIS By RUSS MERRITT Editor-in-Chief**

Last Thursday night, when returning to the Grey House (women’s dorm) during a late evening study break, one of Davidson's exchange coeds was accosted by an unknown assailant in the parking lot behind Cunningham Fine Arts Building. While a resourceful scream by the coed limited the encounter to minor harassment, the incident still has stimulated much discussion throughout the college community concerning campus security.

Many of the coeds have urged the administration to improve lighting in several dark lanes between buildings, while a large number of male students have discussed the possibility of increasing the relatively minuscule force of security officers. Such measures aren't so easily accomplished, however, according to Grover C. Meetze, Director of the Physical Plant, a position which also makes him head of campus security.

“Every year we embark on a campaign to get more lighting on campus, lighting areas of the campus in order of need,” Meetze said. “We simply don't have money in the budget available at this moment to add any more lighting immediately, and besides, many of the boys don't want more lighting.”

Meetze pointed out that the Davidson student, used to the all-male atmosphere of the student body, has not yet realized all the implications involved when female students are added. One of these implications would be the necessity of additional lighting for safety, for women would make the evening life at Davidson much more attractive to men both on and off campus. In essence, a coed campus is much more susceptible to sexual attacks.

Speaking to the question of the size of the security staff, Meetze said that “as far as additional security goes, we're trying to improve the security situation.” There are no immediate plans for making additions to the staff, Meetze said. Meetze said that the problem of girls and the off-campus location of the women’s dorm has made security more difficult. “We have had cooperation from the local police, but to make the security situation more ideal for the girls, people are going to have to start reporting everything that might cause security problems on campus.”

**Nursing Program Initiated**

**By TOM AINSWORTH Staff Writer**

Davidson, in cooperation with Presbyterian Hospital of Charlotte, has started a Male Nursing Assistant Program. The program, in operation since last term, was begun by the request of the hospital, which was in need of help, particularly male nursing assistants who do orderly type work, and to also provide Davidson students with a unique working experience, especially those enrolled in a pre-med program.

The program is not, however, restricted only to science students, according to Donald L. Kimel, associate biology professor and the project’s coordinator. Anyone interested in working in a hospital environment may use the MNA program as an extended studies credit, although the participants should be either juniors or seniors.

The initial part of the course is an extensive training program of talks accompanied by films, taking up 30 hours of classroom time over a two-week period. The MNAs are then assigned different areas of the hospital in which to work, being under the guidance of the nurses there.

The program is far from perfect, though, as evidenced by some of the comments received by those involved. One of them, Rob Krebs, thinks the project has “good possibilities” but “what Presbyterian essentially wants is just male nursing assistants. What we're looking for is seeing different cases, diagnoses, and contact with physicians.” The training program, he adds, is “geared for a sixth-grade level of intelligence” and that a “lot of time is wasted.”

This seems to be the consensus of opinion in regard to a survey conducted by Dave Grissett among the eight other members of the program besides himself, who participated during the fall term. They all thought the training program could have covered the same amount of material in one week, and that most of the films were ineffectual. More demonstrations could be used in the future, they thought, and some even admitted that they actually learned more once they started their work.
