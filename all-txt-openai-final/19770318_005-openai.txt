**Stagnation creeps in at Davidson**

I am currently studying on the JYA program here in West Germany. The main reason for my current presence here is that the program afforded the opportunity to leave Davidson—and receive college credit. If I had not come here, I would have transferred. Next year, I’ll be back. I am not particularly happy about that fact, especially in light of some recent developments, but, for a variety of reasons, I'll be there. I write now because my life here allows the advantage of more objectivity at a distance and because the thought of returning scares me.

So why am I scared and dissatisfied with Davidson? The answer is simple—Davidson is in the process of stagnating. At the expense of the students, the Administration is stripping the College of its creative influences. This applies to the degeneration of our Science building, to two of our social science departments which capitalize on note memorization and multiple-choice tests, the disappearance of the Davidson National, the removal of the Extended Studies courses, the move to turn WDAV into another programmed ROQ with stress on the marvels of Davidson, and monetary priorities designed to keep the facade looking good while the interior decays.

The chances for creative student input are dying. We aren’t given the opportunity to affect ourselves in relation to the college. Our self-development is channeled into getting good grades, attending Patterson Court parties on weekends, waiting for big weekends when there is “really” something going on, and being nice little children. I can’t do that to myself. I want to feel as though I am a thinking force who can take what the faculty has to offer and shape it in terms of myself and my society—not only in terms of Davidson College. I want to express myself intellectually and creatively. I’m asking for a college that responds to students as people and not to trustees and money exclusively.

So what do I have? A radio station designed for Charlotte, a potential golf course, a beautiful new house for guests, a basketball team, and a worn-out school with an old reputation for academic excellence. Thank goodness, somebody thought about JYA. This year has forced me to think for myself, examine my studies and my life in terms of the world, and allowed me to express my personality. Thank goodness for the Honors Center which encourages independent work and creativity and motivated me to do a lot more learning than I had to. These are two ways to circumvent total stagnation, but why does Davidson as a whole appear to be walking backward, suffocating from the plastic bag over its head? Some vital force is missing.

**Prison reform needed**

To the Editor:

On a wintry day like this, during World War II service as Military Aid to the U.S. Ambassador in Beirut, I was assigned as “Observer” at the trial of two young alleged Nazi spies accused of sabotage against the Allied Forces in the Middle East. The all-day court martial took place in a drafty, dimly-lighted one-room schoolhouse in Northern Syria, and it soon became obvious that the two prisoners would be convicted. One felt—like something you could touch—the misery and complete despair of these two young adults, one a German and the other a Greek, both fellow humans. During a short break in the trial, while the military were “at ease” (!?), I found myself acting under some strange compulsion, walking over to the two doomed prisoners and giving each of them a cigarette and a light. They were sentenced to die before the firing squad, and at dawn the following morning, the grisly execution was carried out.

Now, these many years later, I visit a nearby State Prison unit three days a week as a representative of the extension service of a nearby community college. The project is euphoniously called a “learning lab” for social rehabilitation, and the host agency is called, euphoniously, “The Department of CORRECTION” of the North Carolina Division of Prisons. I don’t offer the prisoners cigarettes; these caged human beings at least have their own cigarettes—they can buy them out of the pittance they are allowed to keep from the actual worth of their labor to the State and to private business interests through what is called, also euphoniously, “work release.”

On occasion, I have presented audio-filmstrip “mini courses” (e.g., on “How To Prepare for a Job Interview”); but the lack of quiet physical facilities and the highly transitory nature of the unit (a processing-and-transfer function) made this practically impossible. What is (euphoniously!) called an “educational trailer,” bought with taxpayers’ money, sits idle in the prison compound. Six months ago it had no lights and no heat. Despite the efforts of a very dedicated “Program” staff person, the trailer (which now has had lights repaired) still lacks heat. We have lighted a candle, but still have to curse the cold!

As a consequence, I have been showing films wherever it has been possible: In the dining hall between meals (despite nearly impossible factors of noise of cleaning, kitchen activity, etc.), or in a long cinder-block barred cage which goes under the name of the “dormitory,” where dispirited men languish.half-clothed, half-awake, half-oblivious, along a seemingly unending row of double bunks. There are difficulties; the many windows cannot be screened or curtained, so the films are hard to see; nearby communal public washstands and toilets compete for attention; but something of what appears to be a sense of desolation is, I think, the greatest problem. They are up against a "System," against which they feel almost totally powerless and "hope deferred...which makes the heart sick." Who are these men? Bank embezzlers? Stock swindlers? Important politicians-turned-bribe-takers? Ex-Vice Presidents for rake-offs, or Chief Executives for slaughterous abuse of power? No. These men, whom our society seems to choose for "Correction," are usually young, usually poor, white or black or some other minority group, who usually lived (existed) under deprivation long before running afoul of the law. What should one say to these men? Of course, there are films which have meaning, and serve some purpose; most of these men will someday "revisit the Outside," and must be helped for reentry. But, while we talk to the prisoners, or show them films, or offer them "cigarettes," it seems increasingly clear that it is the WHOLE PRISON SYSTEM (or what George Bernard Shaw called "The Crime of Imprisonment") which is really on trial; indeed, in my humble opinion, already condemned. I would beg the concerned reader to turn to Jessica Mitford’s book Kind and Usual Punishment: The Prison Business; and I would especially commend this to Mr. Amos Reed, whom North Carolina’s new governor has named to run the state’s prisons, and who, after a quick survey, has, I think, rightly concluded that the state has "a most grievous and serious problem." Cigarette?...Anybody got a light? Duncan D. MacBryde '33 Mooresville, N.C.

is missing due in part, I believe, to the Administrative policy of placing too much emphasis on Davidson’s reputation. They treat the problems there with plastic surgery and forget the causes. Renovate Martin Science plus some, allow the students to use their radio station to express themselves and their needs, support club sports, rejuvenate the National, allow and support more experimentation with courses and majors, expect and encourage student creativity with regard to formal education and see what happens to Davidson’s name. Forceful, interested, educated people returning to their home towns, entering the business world or pursuing upper-level degrees who speak with respect for Davidson will do much more than a basketball team as far as enhancing the school’s image. Davidson will have a reputation for energy and innovation, a reputation for responsiveness and still can claim a high percentage of acceptances into professional or graduate schools. I realize that this has been said before and that it's very easy for me to write this and slightly harder to achieve those things I’ve mentioned. But it is time for some action to be taken. I understand the reasoning for pleasing the Trustees, but they are no longer the living force of the college that the students are. They have graduated and are gone. I understand too, the concern over the image of Davidson that the Trustees have. However, their view of the school is tinged with the past and those carefree college days while we are students now. And finally, if it's only money that talks loud enough, remember that the students now are the alumni of the future and that we make Davidson's name, not WDAV or any other simple entity. We are the ones that will or will not come through with money in the future. Take care of our educational needs now and we'll remember Davidson later. Forget us, and we’ll forget you.

SAE pledge terrorists attack ATO house

To the Editor:

"Late News Flash: Last night several terrorists of the SAE Fraternity of Davidson College attacked the ATO House of Davidson College using rounded, white mini-bombs which looked suspiciously like Grade A, large farm eggs. Attempting to pulverize the ATO shield, the drunken, budding pledge-terrorists managed to hit only the wall. No injuries were sustained, though several observers noted that one terrorist apparently lost his clothing in the attempt."

Wa'al, boys, you've done it again: you've really come through this time! Last year I had a difficult time understanding your need to push the ARA Slater refrigerator truck down into the ditch in the middle of Patterson Court—I suppose SAE pledges will be SAE pledges, as the saying goes—but I didn’t really expect such a childish stunt to happen again. I’m always willing to overlook a slight error in judgment and I had hoped you would have a little more common sense in the future. But some people never seem to outgrow Cowboys and Indians, or "Combat!" and I suppose children will be children. So it goes...Just one more thing, though: could you be a little more careful next year, guys? If you can, hit the shield or the stereo of ATO with your eggs, instead of just the walls and floors, or the exterior of the house. Vic Morrow never missed a German unless he had to...maybe if you were a little more sober your aim would be better.
