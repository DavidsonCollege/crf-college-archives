**Wildcats stomp Marshall 78-63**

**Ewodo shows up the Daredevils**

By Matt Pitzer

Call it the Wildcats’ Den, call it the House of Horrors. Call it what you want. But lately, opponents have
come to call Belk Arena dreaded. The men’s basketball team has won 21 of its last 23 games at home,
the latest an impressive 78-63 win over Marshall Saturday night.

Brandon Williams attached those descriptions to the team’s home court following Saturday’s game, expressing confidence that the Wildcats feel very
good playing at home. “We’ve got to let people in the Southern Conference know that this is a terrible place
to play,” Williams says. “Here, we’ll make a statement every game that nobody will match our intensity.”

Saturday night, everything clicked for most of the game for the Wildcats, who improve their overall record to 11-6, including
4-1 in the Northern Division of the conference, good enough for a first place tie with East Tennessee State. The
Thundering Herd (10-7, 2-3) had been the early season surprise in the conference, winning their first six games of the
season, but have now lost their last four in a row. The team is playing under new head coach Billy
Donovan, a Rick Pitino understudy at Kentucky for five years, and has put in place an up-tempo, run-and-gun style of
play, featuring the fast break, the three-pointer, and full-court pressure defense.

Saturday, with the exception of a five-minute span in the second half, Davidson successfully handled everything Marshall threw at it
and even gave the Herd a little dose of their own medicine, clearly inspired by the boisterous crowd which was
fired up itself by the Bud Light Daredevils slam-dunk team. “This was a great game,” Williams says. “We had a
great crowd. Playing a tough out-of-conference schedule, playing on the road, it’s nice to come home to this.”

Williams led the way with 19 points, and George Spain added...

**Wrestling team trudges on with determination**

By Richard Glenn

The Davidson wrestling team has moved into the busiest part of its schedule and has shown signs of improvement. Last
weekend the team traveled to Washington and Lee for a tournament with several conference opponents. Despite several first-round setbacks, the
team wrestled well and came away with three wrestlers placing.

“As a team we shook off our first-round losses and wrestled very well in the second round, and that allowed
us to place some wrestlers,” said junior co-captain Sean Harvey.

Freshman Andy Sterling wrestled as well as he has all season and came away with a third-place finish. Jake Hamilton,
another freshman, also wrestled well and ended up third. Also earning a third-place finish was junior Jesse Kenner. The Wildcats
ended up in fourth place as a team and came back from Virginia to face a tough week of practice.

On Saturday the team traveled back to Virginia, this time to Longwood, where they faced Virginia Tech and Apprentice College.
The team didn’t do as well as they would have liked and ended up...Losing both matches, co-captain Derek Spencer provided
the best performance of the day, and Hamilton managed to pin one of his opponents. The team is still bothered
by some nagging injuries, and with a healthy lineup, the outcome could have been better for the Cats. This week,
the team is planning on working hard as they prepare for one of the toughest matches of the year when
they travel to Atlanta to face Duke, Georgia State, and Ohio State. All three of these teams are formidable opponents,
but if they keep up their spirits, they should be able to help themselves in the long run. “Although we
have a lot of young guys, we have kept up our intensity and are starting to come together as a
team,” adds Harvey. The future looks promising for the Cats as they prepare for the Atlanta tournament and the Alumni
Reunion weekend to be held at Davidson on February 11.

Old Dominion duo leads women’s lacrosse in preseason

Head coach Nancy Hillger performs a pantomime.

By Dave Dwyer

Nancy Hillger, a 1993 graduate of Old Dominion, has been promoted to the position of head coach of the women’s
lacrosse team for the upcoming season. Hillger, who starred in both field hockey and lacrosse at ODU, came to Davidson
in the fall of 1994 as an assistant coach for both those sports. When the previous lacrosse coach, Kersten Kimel,
left for Duke, Hillger took over and has been preparing her team for a tough schedule that begins at the
William and Mary Tournament during the first weekend of spring break.

Hillger is from Rehoboth Beach, Del., where she lived before earning her degree in sports medicine from ODU. She spent
one semester interning for a specialty in cardiac rehabilitation and has begun studying for her master's in exercise physiology. Recruited
by ODU for field hockey, Hillger had never played lacrosse until she arrived in Richmond. Her lacrosse career began when
Sue Stahl, a national recruiter and coach of U.S. women’s lacrosse, came to ODU. She mostly played the third man
position, which is basically a midfield defense position.

After graduating, Hillger wanted to coach both field hockey and lacrosse, and an opportunity to coach at Davidson seemed like
a perfect fit for her. She brought in Jen Deckleman as her assistant. Deckleman also played both field hockey and
lacrosse at ODU before graduating last year. Hillger sees good reason to be optimistic about this season. It is the
first time that the team will play a full 17-game schedule, with the schedule dotted with tough opponents including Richmond
and Lehigh. “The Davidson student-athlete is quite conscious, and my players have given a tremendous effort and demonstrated great character,”
Hillger says. “They have been the type of athletes a person loves to coach.”

Although the first match isn’t until March 4, the squad has been practicing since returning from Christmas break. With a
new coach and a challenging schedule, the women’s lacrosse team is expecting big things for 1995.
