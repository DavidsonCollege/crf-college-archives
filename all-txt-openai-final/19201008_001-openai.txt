BASKETBALL TEAM TO MAKE THREE TRIPS — Wildcats Hold Generals To Two Field Goals

The schedule for the basketball season of 1920-21 has not been completed, but Manager Miley states that the Wildcat quintet will make three trips, one through Virginia, one through North Carolina, and one through South Carolina. Everybody will be glad to hear that there will probably be at least eight or nine games played on the home floor. We have always had better luck when playing at home and each student will have a chance to help win every one of these eight or nine games by being present and by giving the team the utmost support.

Reporters’ Club Begins Definite Work Weekly Meeting to be Held—Entrance Requirements Adopted

The Davidsonian Reporters’ Club had an important called meeting Saturday night after the pictures. This club is composed of students who have done especially good work for The Davidsonian in the past. There are other reporters, but membership in the Reporters’ Club is an honor given those doing the best work. In accordance with the recent request of the staff that there be a representative of the club at the staff meetings, Alex Mitchell, president of the club, was chosen for this work. The staff is also to have a representative at the meetings of the club. This plan is calculated to promote a fuller co-ordination of work in the reportorial department of The Davidsonian, in our determination to make ours “the best college weekly in the South.”

The club decided to meet each Friday evening at 7:15 in the president’s room, for discussion of the best means of improving the reporting. For the information of men who are looking forward to membership in the club, the entrance requirements recently adopted by the club are published herewith. The grading of the literary quality of the write-ups will be done by the staff members, but definite requirements as to faithfulness and punctuality in submitting write-ups must be met or the student will automatically eliminate himself from recommendation for membership.

“The members are to be chosen by the club from two groups, as follows:

“a. A list submitted by The Davidsonian staff, of such students regularly reporting for The Davidsonian during the year drawing to a close as have made a record of not less than 95 per cent in faithfulness in turning in write-ups on assignments given and not less than 90 per cent in punctuality in turning in write-ups by the time specified. (The department editors shall show “on time” or “late” or some other suitable designation on the check sheet of assignments, with provision for excuses being given by the department editors for unavoidable delays).

“b. A list composed of men regularly reporting for The Davidsonian during the year drawing to a close as have made a record of not less than 95 per cent in faithfulness in turning in write-ups on assignments given and not less than 90 per cent in punctuality in turning in write-ups by the time specified, agreeable to the staff, made up of not more than one suggestion from each member of the Reporters’ Club.”

Bronze Tablet Memorial to Gen. Davidson at Hopewell Grave of Revolutionary Hero at Last Properly Marked

On the evening of September 29, at Hopewell Church, 11 miles from Charlotte on the Beatty’s Ford road, a large gathering attended the impressive ceremonies at the dedication of a beautiful bronze memorial tablet erected to the memory of Gen. William Lee Davidson, by the Mecklenburg Chapter of the American Daughters of the Revolution. General Davidson served early in the Revolutionary War as major of the Fourth Regiment of North Carolina troops. He was later promoted to lieutenant-colonel, and was severely wounded at Calson’s Mill. After recovery he was promoted for bravery to the rank of brigadier-general. In the battle of Cowan's Ford he, with 300 men, stood against Cornwallis and his troops, and

Visit of Major Mueller Popular Ex-Commandant Returns to See Former Charges

Last week the student body had a pleasant surprise in the visit of no less a personage than Captain, now Major, A. H. Mueller, who for the last two years was commandant and Professor of Military Science and Tactics of the R. O. T. C. on the Hill. It was a familiar sight to the upper classmen to see the “Colonel,” as he has always been called, back once more on the campus, and everyone was more than glad to have him with us again. His well-known voice and figure have been missed very much this year by the soldiers of the local army, and his presence again forcibly reminded them and others of the many bloodless battles and marches made during the campaigns of last winter and spring. Though making no talk to the battalion as a whole, he received the officers at headquarters and presented his felicitations to them there. During the course of the conversation he spoke of the present commandant, Captain Hearn, in the highest terms possible. Major Mueller was en route from Hendersonville to Fort Oglethorpe, and as his road lay through Charlotte, he could not resist the trip here to see how things were getting along this year. He was a spectator on the parade ground Wednesday morning and watched with interest the efforts of his former charges. Captain Mueller was promoted to the rank of major on the 1st of last July. During the summer months he was commanding officer of the R. O. T. C. Cavalry Camp, Ethan Allen, in New Hampshire. His regular station is now at Fort Ogle- (Continued on page 8)Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

There on February 1, 1781, he gave his life for the cause of liberty and for his country. His body was buried by torchlight in Hopewell cemetery by his friends, Richard Barry and David Wilson, who also took part in the skirmish with the enemy. Here in the central part of the cemetery, the handsome granite monument, with bronze tablet attached, has been placed. Up to this time, the grave has been unmarked, and the movement to suitably honor the memory of General Davidson was started by the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence Chapter. The North Carolina Historical Commission contributed liberally toward the erection of the monument, and with contributions from individual members of the family, a handsome monument was secured.

1921 Quips and Cranks Placed on Firm Financial Basis
Students Vote Appreciable Increase for Best Annual Ever

Failing to obtain additional funds for the 1921 Quips and Cranks by a petition to the custodians of the blanket fee, the Annual management took things into their own hands and called a meeting of the student body last Tuesday morning to put their proposition before the students. C. H. Long, editor-in-chief of the 1921 Quips and Cranks, and C. M. McCaskill, business manager, conducted the meeting. Mr. Long stated the object of the meeting and told the students of the plans whereby the 1921 Quips and Cranks will be the best Annual in the history of the college. Mr. McCaskill then told the students of the funds necessary for the issuing of the proposed Annual. He stated that insufficient funds were on hand to give Davidson College the Annual as outlined by Mr. Long, and unless more funds were subscribed, the students would have to content themselves with an inferior Annual. To provide the funds necessary, Mr. McCaskill asked that each student pledge himself to pay $3 to the Annual management at the opening of the spring term. The students were heartily in favor of Mr. McCaskill’s plan and it was adopted by a unanimous vote of the student body.

Hitherto the policy has been that each student pays a certain amount through the blanket fee and then pays an additional sum for each picture they had in the Annual. This made the Annual cost some students double what it cost others. Under the new arrangement, each student has an equal share in the Annual and in its cost.

Both Teams Impregnable on Defensive — Capt. Hammett Stars for Losers

Two field goals on the part of Silverstein sent the Wildcats down in defeat at the hands of Washington and Lee. The game was hard-fought and although devoid of thrills was featured by the spectacular defensive work on both sides. The Generals threatened to score on several occasions but could not break through the Wildcat defense. Although never in a position to score, the Wildcats experienced the same difficulty in ground gaining. The winners’ chance to score their field goals was a result of superior punting. On every exchange of punts, the Generals gained an advantage of 10 yards or more.

The work of Mattox, playing fullback for the winners, featured. This Roanoke lad penetrated the Red and Black line for the only appreciable gains made by the Generals. Although he was used time and again, he stood up well under the offensive and rarely failed to deliver a gain. Silverstein also played a star game for the winners. His punting was of rare variety and his toe saved the day. Two neatly laid field goals from the 30 and 20-yard lines respectively, gave Washington and Lee enough to win.

For Davidson, the superb playing of Captain Hammett featured. The big boy was in all the plays and succeeded in breaking up the Generals’ aerial attack. McFadden and Massey were the chief ground gainers in the Red and Black backfield. Cassell had the misfortune of getting his bad shoulder hurt again and was forced to retire from the game in the first few minutes of play.

The game began with Cassell kicking off and Washington and Lee returned the ball about 10 yards. A series of line plunges carried the ball to the Wildcats’ 10-yard line. Here the line stiffened, however, and the ball was lost on downs. Davidson failed to gain, however, and punted to mid-field. Washington and Lee advanced to a position for a field goal. Silverstein attempted and failed. Davidson lost the ball on downs and Washington and Lee again placed the ball in position for a try for a field goal. Silverstein sailed it true this time and the quarter ended 3 to 0 in Washington and Lee’s favor.

The second quarter was played in mid-field, neither side being able to gain ground through the line. Washington and Lee opened up an aerial attack but abandoned it after Shep- (Continued on page 8)
