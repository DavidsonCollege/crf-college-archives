**WDAV Holds "Celebration" Week**
**Station's Goal to Increase Membership**
By Sean Lind

From Saturday, October 24 to Monday, November 2, Classical 89.9, WDAV held its annual “Celebration" week. The annual membership drive
was broadcast live from the Morrison Room in the Davidson College Union. From 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. every day,
announcers were on the air in pairs, urging listeners to call in their support for WDAV. Students and a volunteer
core of about 150 people from the WDAV listening area helped out answering phones and taking pledges. Neighboring food establishments
donated food for the week.

“Celebration” is held each fall to increase membership and raise money to support the 100,000 watt Davidson College radio station.
WDAV’s Development Director Jill McGuire, who organized the fundraiser, said that this year’s goal was 2400 members, which includes 1800
renewal and 600 new members. As this paper went to press, 1913 members (1488 renewal and 425 new) had pledged
their support of WDAV. 66% of WDAV’s more than $500,000 budget comes from membership pledges and program underwriting from businesses.
According to Station Manager John Clark, this total is higher than most public radio stations.

Another function of “Celebration” is to accent WDAV’s support of not only classical music, but “the arts” in general. During
the week, guest performers, community announcers, and guests from various arts organizations supplement the normal schedule of classical music.

**Alumnus Announces Establishment of Scholarship**
**Author Cornwell Founds Writing Grant**
By Sally Stone

Davidson alumnus and best-selling writer Patricia Daniels Cornwell returned to campus Wednesday, October 28 to announce the foundation of the
Patricia Daniels Cornwell writing scholarship. Cornwell briefly spoke, entertained questions, and signed copies of her novels following President Emeritus Samuel
Spencer’s formal announcement at 10:30.

The scholarship winner, beginning with the class of 1997, will be chosen for excellence in writing in a nationwide talent
search. The award consists of full tuition payment plus a $10,000 stipend. Cornwell’s intent is to “have Davidson known as
a place where writers go.” Commenting that she never imagined coming back to Davidson for this purpose, Cornwell credited Davidson
for her writing start. “I would not be standing here now...had I not had this experience at Davidson.” She particularly
noted the encouraging and nurturing atmosphere of Davidson where she “was given a chance.”

Patricia, or Patsy, Cornwell graduated in 1979 and began her writing career at The Charlotte Observer as an investigative reporter.
It was there that she became intrigued with the crime beat. She pursued a similar avenue in Richmond as a
volunteer police officer in the homicide squad.

**Davidson Faculty Member Attacked in South Carolina**
**Kimbrough Shot, Robbed in Beaufort**
By Mandy Curtis

Tish Kimbrough, secretary in the Dean of Students office, was shot in the mouth on Friday, October 9 while touring
Beaufort, South Carolina. After dining in a restaurant in the small town...town, Kimbrough and her companion, Francis Hillman of Concord,
were attacked by two men in the parking lot. After shooting Kimbrough, the men stole both of the women’s purses.
Kimbrough and three other women from Concord were touring the historical South Carolina town that weekend. Having finished the candlelight
tour, the women went to eat at a restaurant only two blocks from the bed and breakfast where they were
staying. At 10 o’clock, Kimbrough and Hillman walked out to the parking lot. After the two women got in, two
men immediately appeared on either side of the car. One, with a ski mask on, stopped Kimbrough from closing her
door. According to Kimbrough, the first thing she can remember is the gun that the man held about twelve inches
from her face and then a shot. Before saying anything, the man shot a bullet that went through Kimbrough’s upper
lip, hit her teeth, and lodged itself in the back of her neck. He, like the other man, proceeded to
reach across Kimbrough to grab her purse. With that, they took off. “It happened so fast; it couldn’t have been
more than two seconds,” stated Kimbrough.

Clinton Preferred in a Campus Poll
Democrat Leads Bush 47% to 33%
By Tom Koonce

Tomorrow the people decide. Will President George Bush be elected for a second term, lengthening the Reagan-Bush era to sixteen
years? Will Governor Bill Clinton succeed in convincing Americans of the need for change and put a Democrat back in
the White House? Or will Ross Perot pull off a miracle by persuading Americans that they need to move away
from party politics and elect an independent? We should know the answer as to who will be our next president
by tomorrow night around ten, unless the trend of this election year continues and the unpredictable occurs, sending a close
race to the Electoral College to be decided or maybe ultimately to a vote in the House of Representatives.

National public opinion polls have been a part of the daily reporting of this year’s presidential “horse race.” This past
week, members of the Davidson Young Democrats conducted their own poll of the Davidson campus to determine who the majority
of the student body preferred to be the next President. The group polled 727 students under the guise of reporters
for the Davidsonian. Out of the 727 students polled, Governor Bill Clinton was preferred by 47.3% of the respondents, President
George Bush by 32.5%, and Ross Perot by 6.4%. 13.3% of the students polled were undecided. The poll did not
differentiate between whether or not the student planned to vote.

College Democrats and Republicans have also been working hard on this campus to try and further the cause of their
candidates. Several students have volunteered at campaign offices around the county. The Young Democrats volunteered in Charlotte and helped out
in organizing and preparing for Governor Clinton’s rally last month. They arranged for a bus to
