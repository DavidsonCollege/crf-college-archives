**Movie Review**

**Fargo goes the distance**

By Ed Atlee
Movie Critic

Let me state for the record that I am not a die-hard Coen Brothers fan. The Brothers, (Joel is the director, Ethan the producer) have made a number of off-beat films that have generally met with great critical favor. Films like Blood Simple, Raising Arizona, and Miller’s Crossing have cemented their reputation as some of the rulers of the independent film circuit. I always found them a bit too cold for my liking. Sure, I admired the technical brilliance and snappy dialogue of the films, but I often felt like they were the cinematic equivalent of the Tin Man — bright and shiny on the outside, but ultimately missing the most important organ of all.

Then I saw Fargo. The latest from the Brothers is not only as funny and intelligent as some of their other films, but it also has a heart. The plot goes something like this: Jerry Lundergaard needs some cash — now. Since he has a rich father-in-law who adores his daughter but considers Jerry pond scum, Jerry launches a plot to take his father-in-law for some serious dough. Jerry’s bright idea is to have his wife kidnapped and held for ransom while he collects the money from his father-in-law. The plot gets fairly tangled, as do so many of the Brothers' films, but this one is fun to watch unravel.

This time the Brothers have created characters the audience really cares about, whether it be the inept Jerry, the strange kidnappers, or the idiot father-in-law. Even though all of these characters are despicable in their own way, I couldn’t help but feel sorry for each of them at least once during the film. Unraveling the mystery is the police chief, Marge Gunderson (played brilliantly by Frances McDormand, Joel Coen’s wife). She is a compassionate woman whose apparently slow exterior (it is so hard to get past the annoying Midwestern accents!) masks the smartest mind by far in the film. Franny may seem harmless, but she is one heckuva sheriff.

So come one, come all, to the latest Coen Brothers extravaganza. If you like smart camera shots, witty dialogue, graphic violence, and snow — lots of it — then this film is for you. If you don’t like any of that stuff, go anyway. You'll get the chance to laugh at all of the ridiculous accents for weeks afterwards.

**Phoenix Rising**

**The Symphony performs an emotionally powerful selection of old and new pieces**

This past Thursday, Davidson College and Classical 89.9 WDAV premiered our own Composer-in-Residence Richard Prior’s Concerto for Piano and Orchestra: Phoenix Rising, written for Pianist-in-Residence James Swisher. In addition to Prior’s concerto, the Davidson College Symphony Orchestra performed Benjamin Britten’s (1913-1976) Simple Symphony and Mozart’s (1756-1791) Overture to Marriage of Figaro.

The concert opened with the operatic overture. In Mozart’s Marriage of Figaro, the overture serves to capture the humorous tone and the impending crazed mystique that pervades the opera. The symphony achieved the comic overtones through insightful interpretation and articulation. With exceptional poise and grace, Eleanor Merrill, concert master, assembled the talents of the string section in the piece following, Britten’s Simple Symphony. This work is...arranged in a traditional four-movement presentation, but with a fast second and a slower third movement written in traditional dance forms. The distinctive second movement utilized the string technique pizzicato, providing a lighthearted atmosphere. Each movement, varying in rhythm and character, contributed to the work’s jovial and naive nature. After a brief introduction by Rachel Stewart from WDAV, Prior’s piece was unveiled with a slow introduction. In the introduction, the piano declares the opening statement that is the development of the rising gesture, the crux of the piece. This prefacing section advances into a relentless and driving energy during which the piano gradually builds increasingly complex and virtuosic strands. The second movement is cast in a romantic vein, designed to display the soloist and orchestra in a specific interpretive mode. This movement also concentrates upon the rising motive that is heard in numerous embodiments within the orchestral texture. The third and final movement is based upon rhythm. This movement steadily intensifies to a climax in which the rising gesture reaches its final transformation, the foundation of the piece. Prior musically encapsulated the emotion enveloped within the formidable bonds between composer and soloist and composer and orchestra. Reminiscent of the Grieg Piano Concerto in A Minor, also performed by James Swisher in last year’s spring concert, Swisher mesmerized the audience through a momentous display of true artistic ability, on part of both the composer and the soloist. The power of the performance overwhelmed the audience, who left after a standing ovation speechless and simply astounded.

Dance troupe explores nature’s order

Last Tuesday evening, the dance theater company Forces of Nature performed in Love Auditorium. The ensemble came to Davidson as part of the Artists Series presented by the College Union. The group consists of 15 dancers and three musicians. Forces of Nature uses characteristics of traditional African and modern western dance to create a unique style of their own. In their performance, they pay homage to the spirits of their ancestors as well as the spirits of animals. Many of their dances involve symbolic images of animals. According to the leader of their troupe, Forces of Nature’s mission is to “create a ‘Living Book’ from which all ages experience the talent, histories, mythologies, and accomplishments of the African Diaspora and its influence in American Dance.”

One of the more interesting dances that the troupe performed was entitled “Night Predators.” The description of this dance is “By the law that grants me your flesh that I may survive so will my body be consumed by the order of that same law.” This dance featured three scenes. Several dancers depicted carnivorous animals in the first scene. The second scene featured a herbivorous animal. The third depicted the carnivores attacking and killing the herbivore. As the scene progressed, other carnivores came and devoured the first carnivores. The dance came to a conclusion as dancers dressed as men threw nets over the fighting carnivores. In essence, the dance mimicked the food chain.

One of the dancers performed a solo piece entitled “The Mud Below.” This piece depicted a reptile and various magical transformations into two other creatures. Set to music reminiscent of a rain forest, the soloist portrayed the transmutation of several primi-
