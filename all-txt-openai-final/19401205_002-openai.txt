over again the statement made by Hank Bahnson in chapel Monday. Don't think of it as a neat way of
putting the thought, or as a fine appeal, but consider the thought itself--seriously. “If going to a few shows, or
cutting some cokes means more to you than helping to spread Christian education in China, then don't hesitate to do
it.” Concert Series Tuesday night John McCrae appeared in Chambers Auditorium as the first artist in the 1940-41 concert series

The various musical organizations have long gone without the recognition which their hard work and long hours entitles them to.
But that is not the point here. The point is that a great many of our students are passing up,
and will continue to do so, an opportunity to hear some fine music at a time and place which all
can afford; and the reason will be that a great many of these men may be missing the concerts just
because music is scorned here by many people. And what a mistake that is, when one looks at the fine
men and women in the past and present who have loved music, and when one realizes the part which music
has played in all our lives. The appreciation of the fine arts is one thing which is definitely lacking in
modern college curricula. In our present day rush we have no time for it, and because we have no time,
or because our minds are too superficial, we are never beneficial to ever learn to appreciate such things. That paper
is the official history of college life, and is a medium of student and faculty opinion. As such, it welcomes
any contributions or communications to it, provided such does not contain derogatory reference to faculty or students, pro- fanity, or
destructive criticism. All material must be in the editor’s hands by Monday night of the week that it is to
be printed, and the editor reserves the right to reject part or all of any contribution or communication. Welcome, Dr.
Cunningham After searching for many months, the trustees have secured a new president for Davidson- Dr. J. R. Cunningham of
Winston Salem. Dr. Cunningham comes to Davidson after a rich and widely varied life as a popular minister in several
pastorates where he was held in high esteem by all who knew him. His friends have commended him to his
new associates with the highest praise. It is indeed fortunate that Davidson is able to have such a man to
follow Dr. Lingle in the president's chair. The student body eagerly awaits the first public appearance of Dr. Cunningham here,
which it is hoped will not be too far in the future. And until then, The Davidsonian extends a most
cordial welcome to Dr. Cunningham, and wishes him all success in his work here. Loosen the Purse Strings With the
announcement by the YMCA that the Christmas fund this year will go to the support of a foreign missionary, John
Snell, the student body in general mentally noted the fact, set it down as a worthy purpose, and will think
very little about it any more; except on those occasions when some representative approaches them personally, or when someone talks
about it in chapel. But it is to be hoped that our students will not forget about it when the
time comes to unloosen the purse strings and give. This year the objective has been set at $1,000, which is
somewhat higher than last year. But the purpose which the “Y” hopes to accomplish is larger also. An average contribution
of $1.55 will meet the amount which has been asked. And this sum can be afforded by nearly every man
on the campus. When we realize the money we spend monthly on useless things, a dollar or two given to
such a cause seems too little. And it is. That is why the YMCA should have no trouble at all
in raising the money. But it will. And the reason will be that a great many will procrastinate—“I’ll have it
next week”—instead of giving now. There is little use here to argue as to whether this is a propitious time
to send new missionaries into a war-torn country. Anyone who stops to consider the matter will soon realize that this
work must go on under all conditions, and that it has survived past wars, and will survive future ones. There
is no basis for doubt as to the need for more missionaries. If we are never beneficial to ever learn
to appreciate such things, we condemn them. That is a sad state. Phi Mu Alpha is to be congratulated for
presenting these concerts. But more than that, after they have gone to the trouble, time and expense to give us
such an opportunity to hear really great music, the student body should be anxious to take advantage of the opportunity,
and use it to enrich themselves. There are five more concerts this year, and any man would be foolish to
miss one without thoroughly considering the matter. In the future we expect to see the auditorium much fuller—with students who
can appreciate music at its best, or who have the sense to want to learn something of it when given
such a chance. Did Wake Cut Us? So Wake Forest has dropped us off their basketball and baseball schedule! While
almost any comment will sound as if it were merely “sour grapes,” it can and should be said that no
one here is particularly perturbed about the matter. After all, athletics are supposed to be a means for students to
partake of necessary exercise and to lead to better relations between schools. And in the past few years no one
can say that our athletic relations with Wake Forest have led to better relations, for if anything it has been
to the contrary. This change in schedule was to be expected sooner or later after the trouble over the Charlotte
Stadium last year. Perhaps in the future when the Deacs become more amateurish, athletic relations can be continued. Of course
Davidson competes with other schools where subsidization is known to exist, even though it is under a faint covering. That
was never the main point, as many seemed to think. But some schools, like people, never remember the saying, "It
isn't so much who is that a great many of our students are Exceeding Speed Limit The percentage of fatal
automobile accidents due to excessive speed increased again in 1938 according to an analysis released by The Travelers Insurance Company.
Three years ago in 1936, 32.6% of all persons killed as the result of some driver’s lawlessness met death because
of speed. In 1937 that percentage rose to 36.8%, and last year, 8,410, or 39.6% of the total of 32,000
persons who died in automobile accidents, were killed because of exceeding speed limits. Is experience the best teacher? If so,
the lesson taught by the annually mounting total of deaths due to excessive speed is not being taken seriously by
drivers. Millions of words are poured into type each year in an effort to stem the rising tide of fatalities
due to the single factor of speed, but just as children will play with matches, so the automobile drivers of
America continue to toy with speed, killing thousands annually. No one can regard with complacency last year's record of 32,000
killed and more than a million injured, or the fact that speed is the largest contributing factor to that disastrous
record. Letters to the Editor Dear Andy I just wanted to bring the attention of the student body to the

in it. Never before (or since, we suppose) have we seen anything to compare with four men paid to check
on just who is present at a service dedicated to the worship of our God. Of course, we have been
over the reasons for this time and again, and they seem good when looked at from one viewpoint. But there
is another viewpoint to be considered also. However, this is not the time for a discussion of that. But those
four monitors look very much out of place at vespers!

He takes the "Arab Dance" and the "Dance of the Mirlitons" from P. Tschaikowsky's "Nutcracker Suite" and presents two delightful
classical-swing arrangements. Tschaikowsky, himself, might not appreciate Clinton's remodeling job but this is a must record for all you moderns
who like sweet swing. Incidentally, Ole Glenn dedicated a number to this column on his broadcast Tuesday, the 19th. The
title was "The Siren Song" and it was in the typical Miller style. Thanks a lot, Glenn, we'll plug you
in the future.

Here are the returns so far Down Beat's band contest: Swing Division (in the following order): Benny Goodman, Duke Ellington,
Jimmy Dorsey, Woody Herman, Count Basie. Sweet Division (in the following order): Glenn Miller, Tommy Dorsey, Duke Ellington, Benny Goodman.
In the fight for the "King of Corn" title, Clyde McCoy and Guy Lombardo are waging a close battle with
the former ahead by one vote. However, if the corniest record were being picked, we're confident that Lombardo's "St. Louis
Blues" would win by a mile, easily surpassing Clyde's masterpiece, "Sugar Blues."

Nobis is one of the best Saturday shows in a long time. The story is laid in the southern jungles

pigeons, later on humming telegraph wires—and—finally by a little man with an idea that was great because he thought of
it first. Robinson plays the part of Reuter and at first meets with bad luck, but finally is successful and
acclaimed by all.

"A Night at Earl Carroll's"—Ken Murray, Rose Hobart, and Lillian Cornell. This is the story of a life that centered
around a nightclub where beautiful and enchanting girls came. Ken Murray has a hard time picking out the one for

"Three Men From Texas"—William Boyd, Russel Hayden, Andy Clyde, and Morgan Wallace. Out of the Old West rode three gay
and brave men who fought for one another and also gave their all for honor. They blazed a trail across
Texas that was respected and honored by all. Fast at the draw was good life insurance and these three carried
one of the fastest draws this side of the Rio Grande. It is a picture that is filled with excitement,
humor, and romance.

The past week goes down in the diary of many a student: the deals on record count into the hundreds
with the under-table maneuvers passing this figure. Of course, the cards were dealt from the top of the deck when
five of the moguls shot to N.Y. City Wed. to attend a national convention. However, the rumor has it that
Rev. McLean spent his time over at Times Square using his dime in the Dime Dance Club along with the
sailors. The rest of the time he was doing no little bit of operating in the hotel. Goot Taylor was
another frequenter of the famous Dime Club. These two men seem to have done business together. McReynolds lodged with his
"tele" in the same place and showed so little interest in the fraternity course offered by the convention that he
received a flat failure for all of his strained efforts. Everybody's friend, Pat Vereen, got on the bus from an
overdose of Cokes—he cut no less than ten in one night. At the Club Conga, the torch singer sang around
the floor several times attempting plays from scrimmage and directed Ross's world-wide smile on his face. His date grabbed him,
who by the way is a famous model of 1940, when the singer sought to lure him backstage.

Sitatz shot out to Nashville to try and relock with his old high school flame. She wired she had a
turkey preserve McReynolds try on it: the big game hunter, not hesitating for the second formal communique, flew out. The
paper manages to find its way down to Greenville each week so Skinny Dick Arnold asks that all pernicious propaganda
concerning him be censored. Hutch Booker ambled over to the Tavern for the first time this year to lead a
song session the other night. Ashby Dick, the man from OV Skump, is out for the heart of the girls
these days and managed to get her picture on the first date in Wilmington Sat. pm. Big Klontz elected himself
to the head cheerleader's post at the Citadel game but after numerous tries at yells he gave up in disgust.
He will more than likely write a letter to the editor this week against the D. C. spirit. The chapter
house of Alpha Beta Chi was the most popular site in the seaport town. It’s only natural that all dope
of this famous place be withheld from print. Mac Morris has such a case with a lady in the city
that she is taking him with her to Chicago to spend the Christmas holidays. Merry Christmas, Mac! We all envy
you, as we know you will have a most enjoyable time of it.

Phantom Phil Eagan caught a zippy trip to U. of Geo. where he refereed the window-sill brawl some of the
boys at the Chi Phi house were having. Joe Eaves did his operating behind the scenes in Athens. Niven and
Tipp were wending given a cigar on the sidewalks of Wilmington when some of the yokel boys slipped them off
the well-known chair. Flushed—Apic Means, who is about to begin his career on the stage or rather close it in
the role of the Cop in "Margin for Error," got noxious at the game and at the dance afterwards. Poss
McLean, of the class of '40, got back from his cruise as a prospective naval officer with some long tales,
such as the two don'ts of the Navy, the first night on shore, etc. Young Marion Mobley got thoroughly fisted
at Converse for being so noxious in the parlor with his operations. Flash! Keyhole Browning has just bought two more
frat pins. Who are they for, short fellow? Reporting on the whole weekend—the dope was mighty scarce as all the
dealers concealed their operations well, but front-line reports indicate many movements going on throughout the South. Naturally, I stayed on
the campus—as usual.

BY TOM CAUBLE

ON GIRL-BREAK DANCES:
There is no one event that can so completely determine the mettle of which a collegian is made as a
girl-break dance. The undergraduate must be completely on the alert to emerge unscathed from such an experience. All his faculties
must be whetted and brought to bear if he is to embody the social niceties so necessary to these occasions.
In short, this is the acid test of his mind, endurance, and intellect. In default of the little arts and
devices used by young ladies at conventional dances, he must depend upon determination and Dame Fortune to carry him through.

First, of course, he must be immaculately attired. The senior with foresight may also suspend one or two of his
more important activity keys from his watch chain. This is necessary to lend interest to his person and the results
obtained are much the same as those gained through wearing an ambassadorial ribbon. He need not, of course, be holding
any information in order to fulfill this requirement, but he must surely and certainly discharge a continuous flow of small
talk. He must temper this conversation with a lively and interested countenance during the fox trots, and be ready to
assume at a moment's notice that dreamy and contented expression in keeping with the waltz.

The factor of endurance is also a point not to be taken lightly. The frequent breaks he is used to
under the regular system are not his in this reversal of all that is conventional. Some have observed the custom
of going into strict training in order to ready themselves for these girl-break functions. Tip-top physical shape is then to
be counted as a necessity.

Let us illustrate these ideas by considering the case of Noxious Normie, who last week attended the annual fall frolic
at Woman’s Mechanical & Textile U. The Norm rolled in the personification of paragraph four (immaculately attired) except that he
was wearing saddle shoes instead of the usual black patent leathers, which he had forgotten. This was not considered a
gross oversight at the broadminded W. M. & T. U., however. His keys were impressive indeed (by their number). On
closer perusal, it might have been determined that he had included among them a high school honor society medallion (borrowed),
and the trademarks of several extinct honorary organizations, but nevertheless they were impressive.

Noxious seems to have experienced most difficulty in being glib. Since his usually colorful vocabulary was more or less restricted
by his surroundings, he was rather at a loss for a time. However, his naturally agreeable nature asserted itself and
carried the day in this department.

Now the facial expressions in keeping with the tempo of the music were right down N.N.'s alley. Being a third-floor
satellite, he was a master of interesting facial contortions. He assumed first an aloof scowl that had great success and
followed this with an interested smirk and then the climactic dreamy stare. These three expressions flitted with great agility across
his brow.

Alas! Normie survived every test but the physical. His endurance failed him. He was ingloriously winded by intermission and further
let down by the lemonade and cookies. He did manage to weave and stagger, however, until the playing of the
Mechanical and Textile Alma Mater, at which time he (Continued on Page Six)
