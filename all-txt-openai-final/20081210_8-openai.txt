A statement of purpose proclaims the liberal education of students for lives of leadership. In one sense, the failure to
satisfy the semester performance represents a serious hole in, as well as many other dialectic positions. Feedback is a central
cog in the learning process. Countless hours of work result in only a letter on a computer screen. Once the
work is done, it is never seen again. The student loses the obvious benefits of professor feedback and the potential
to learn from mistakes. So who is to blame for this lapse? Simply put, everyone. Ultimately, the student must be
responsible. If professors automatically returned corrected final assignments, nearly all students would benefit. Unhappily, success in facilitating this process depends
on professors. If professors returned graded exams and papers, their valuable criticism would undoubtedly reach many more students. Returning assignments
would also guard against errors in spelling that the student could detect if they are inevitably caught in the whirlwind
of studying, writing, and stress. To what end do we view the attention we rightfully merit in our classwork? In
omitting this important function, we lose a vital part of the educational process.

At first glance, Obama’s election represents a frequent trend in American politics: the peaceful overthrow of those in power. Beginning
in 2006, the six years of Republican control of Washington were rapidly erased by a storm of Democratic fury. That
shift is nothing new. The larger ramifications of this cycle, however, will have long-term consequences on the world. A recent
article on Salon.com describes Obama’s administration as the first of America’s Fourth Republic. The first three originated with Washington, Lincoln,
and FDR, respectively. In each 72-year cycle, the first half was marked by growing government intervention, only to be challenged
by ideals of small government. But in each cycle, the Jeffersonian philosophies of decentralization could only streamline, not reverse, Hamilton’s
style of strong government. Does our country approach such a new age? Will Obama’s presidency deliver new technologies and discoveries?
Will the next four or eight years reverse not only Reagan’s revolution but Roosevelt’s as well? Washington gave us a
republic; Lincoln, a nation; and Roosevelt, a superpower. May something comparable be in the works from this White House transition?

The fall of the Republicans simply represents the recurrent upheaval inherent to American democracy. The argument against such musing is
obvious—we voted for Obama purely because of short-term aims. The war, economic recovery, and a clear reversal of Bushian politics
stood at the forefront of our minds, not the genesis of some overarching historical movement. Yes, Obama promises change, but
no American voter is so foolish as to expect a Lincoln or Roosevelt. I hope. The fall of the Republicans
simply represents the recurrent upheaval inherent to American democracy. Once the country moves too far in one direction, the people
naturally seek equilibrium. That’s the beauty of two-party politics—the constantly swinging pendulum of power. Obama’s victory does signify a significant
extreme of this pattern—control by the same party of both the White House and Congress and a strong extension of
control in the latter to boot. Typically, voters pit the executive and legislative against each other—Reagan versus a Democratic Congress
and Clinton versus a Republican one. While this rapid shift in power seems to indicate an unprecedented tide of change,
it originates in the previous Republican gains. The Right acquired too much power, and Americans sought to temper it, admittedly
with a vengeance. The greatest lesson learned is that Karl Rove’s long-term Republican majority will never happen (thankfully), nor will
a Democratic one. Washington gave us a republic; Lincoln, a nation; and Roosevelt, a superpower. May something comparable be in
the works from this White House transition? But Obama’s election should not be...downplayed—the situation he faces is too monumental. A
tattered economy, a battered international image, and nothing less than the decline of a superpower face the new president. The
New York Times describes Obama as, “a 21st century president in a 19th century world.” As powers realign and as
emerging economies gain power, he must redefine America’s role on this planet. The Salon article attributed a new technology to
each of the three previous republics: industrialization, railroads, and national transportation, respectively. Will Obama’s legacy include a similar technological revolution?
Is solar power the new steam engine? Though much depends on Obama’s policies, only time and a little bit of
luck will tell. For now, his focus must stick with the short term—quoting the Salon article, “The broad outlines of
technological and economic change merely provide the frame for the picture; the details depend on the groups that emerge victorious
in political battles.” The Democrats must first tackle the financial crisis and, in doing so, may accidentally form a new
economic direction. Even as Obama turns his eyes toward colossal projects, he must recognize that he was elected for a
short-term goal—to reverse the disastrous policies of his predecessor. The American people are just as likely to replace Obama in
2012 if he shifts the country too far in the other direction. John Morgan ’12 is undeclared. He is from

Reality tempers ‘Change’ for Obama

Where has all the change gone? For the past two years, “Change We Can Believe In” has adorned many a
podium and banner. But now that the dream has arrived, it has disappeared. Sure, the slogan lost some shine after
the 35-year Senate veteran, Joe Biden, was selected as a running mate, but that was just the vice-president. Now the
change seems to have left Barack Obama’s administration. The names Daschle, Clinton, Holder, Summers, Geithner, and Gates are relics of
past administrations. They have all been in Washington D.C. before, many as major players. Tom Daschle was the Senate Majority
Leader. Larry Summers was Clinton’s Treasury Secretary. Eric Holder was the Deputy Attorney General. Granted, they are not holdovers from
the Bush administration (save Gates), but they certainly are not new, nor do they represent change. In claiming that Obama’s
appointees compose a team of rivals, the media has continued its adoration of catchphrases that ignore fact. Which of those
appointees think differently than Obama? Hillary Clinton, Bill Richardson, and Joe Biden were primary opponents, but their differences were minuscule.
Will any of them protest the closing of Guantanamo Bay or amnesty for illegal aliens? Will they oppose Obama’s tax
increases? No, of course not. They all have the same basic policy ideas. Now, I am not criticizing Obama’s cabinet
choices. When you amass over 60 million votes, you get the right to pick who will carry out your policies
independently of public opinion.

Change also seems evanescent in regards to Obama’s policies. No longer does an Iraq withdrawal seem imminent. Likewise, he has
backed off plans to immediately increase marginal tax rates on the top two income brackets. His promise to “make oil
companies like Exxon pay a tax on their windfall profits, and...use the money to help families pay for their skyrocketing
energy costs and other bills” has been shelved. The evaporation of calls for change, as well as the softening of
anti-Iraq rhetoric, is a direct result of his election. Running for president and being president are on opposite sides of
the river. You have no responsibilities running for president. However, when you reach the Resolute desk, you recall Harry Truman’s
sign “The Buck Stops Here.” For the past eight years, Democrats had George W. Bush to blame for failures. Now,
with a Democrat-controlled White House and Congress, the blame will fall solely on Obama and his Capitol comrades. In the
beginning, they will continue to blame Bush, but that excuse will only last so long. Of course, given the world
Obama will confront, he may soon long for the Bush years. He will face a hostile world that seems to
be closing in on America’s shores, not to mention an economic fiasco. Now that Barack Obama has sat in on
a few intelligence and economic briefings, reality might have hit him hard. It is difficult to ignore the many threats
to American interests, especially when men with commanding titles tell you to. As president, Obama will take the heat if
something goes awry. Simply put, Obama’s message of change does not mesh with keeping America safe and economically secure. Thus,
Obama has had to change his message of ‘Change.’
