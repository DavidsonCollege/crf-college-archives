Your Film Report Card By CHARLIE LUTHER

It looks as if the new film editor is off to a bad start. I know that many readers will disagree, but here is the dope I could gather for Wednesday:

“TEST PILOT” with Myrna Loy, Clark Gable, and Spencer Tracy is a top-notch picture. It tells the story of a test pilot and his adventures.

CAT NINE WINS

Davidson was knocked out in the eighth inning before Ficklen came to the game. No Davidson man got over one hit, and the only extra base blow for the Cats was a double in the third inning.

Davidson 000 000 000—0 2 6
Wake Forest 411 020 00x—11 13 0

Batteries: Steere and Kellam; Winning and Peele.

Downed By Wake Forest

Two Wake Forest hurlers allowed but one hit apiece as they set the Cats down scoreless on Thursday in the last game of the tour. The Deacons bunched hits in the first frame and scored seven times to cinch the game. Steere went the entire distance for Davidson, giving up thirteen hits. He and Kellam had the only Davidson hits.

The Cats came out of their slump when they took Clemson to the score of 7-2. Steere allowed eight hits and Davidson won.
