Students ‘Taste the Harvest’ of local farms

On Friday, Oct. 17, the Davidson community was invited to the Lily Gallery to “Taste the Harvest.” A highly collaborative
effort, the event was organized by Alex Gregor ’08 and co-sponsored by the Environmental Action Committee, Engage for Change, the
EcoHouse, the Sustainability Office, PS, and GreenPrint. Students and community members tasted locally grown food provided by Know Your Farms,
a local food buying club run by Davidson alumna Christy Shi.

The audience sampled a menu artfully prepared by PS, Davidson’s Student-Run Restaurant, which featured autumn latkes, swiss chard gratin, honey
roasted sweet potatoes, apple galette, and herb-marinated flank steak, while they listened to two panels discuss issues surrounding the menu’s
ingredients. The first panel consisted of farmers from the Mecklenburg area, and the second panel featured representatives from Catawba Lands
Conservancy, the LandTrust for Central North Carolina, and the Davidson Farmers’ Market, which advocate farmland preservation in North Carolina.

As the audience enjoyed PS’s locally-grown menu, Gregor introduced the panels, saying, “Taste the Harvest aims to inform about the
important connections between plough, person, and plate, and to illustrate how the way we eat has a profound influence on
our communities and our environment.” Large-scale, industrialized agriculture has a profoundly negative influence over our environment—the industrial food system uses
19 percent of America’s fossil fuel, more than any economic sector other than automobiles, and causes about 37 percent of
the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions.

“Taste the Harvest” allowed the audience to taste the other side of agriculture—the small-scale family farm. Moderator Christy Shi first
asked her panel to answer the educated omnivore’s dilemma—organic or local?

Lee Menius of Wild Turkey Farms openly admitted to being unreceptive to organic foods. “I used to think that organic
was just a bunch of hippie farming,” he said. However, Menius said that he has since drastically changed his views.
Menius’s farm is not certified organic, but he says that they come close. Brent Barbee of Barbee Farms added that
the certified organic label is almost financially impossible for a family farm. Dobson Farm’s Sam Dobson agreed, citing the family
farmer’s need for profit, saying, “If it’s not profitable you’re going to see another housing development spring up.”

The panel also discussed the deceptive nature of supermarket labels. According to Menius, Harris Teeter’s definition of local is within
10 hours of transportation from their warehouse. “That could be as far away as Orlando, Florida,” Menius said. That distance
is probably not the average eater’s idea of local. Since supermarket labels so often distort the truth, Barbee encouraged the
audience to buy food at farmer’s markets. With face-to-face interaction between grower and eater, the consumer avoids untrustworthy labels and
sees, as Barbee says, “farmers who eat what they sell.” By directly supporting these farmers, the consumer supports the local
community and the local economy.

Grateful Growers Farm’s Natalie Veres gave her logic behind buying local. “I want the impact of my purchase to enrich
the community around me,” Veres said, “I need to support my neighbors, and I need my neighbors to support me.”
Veres was optimistic about the future of small-scale farming. “I want to feed a lot of people from a small
space, and I want to make a profit, and it can be done,” she said. However, she urged students to
change how our society undervalues farmers and farming, to bring a sense of respect back to the profession.

Menius also addressed the students, saying, “You’re going to be in a position of power.” He urged future leaders to
recognize the immense value of sustainable agriculture.His opinion must be “environmentally sustainable, economically sustainable, and socially sustainable.” When diet-related diseases
like heart disease and type-two diabetes are among the top causes of death in America, the old saying “you are
what you eat” proves true, for we are paying the price of cheap industrialized food with the deterioration of our
national health. “Cheap food is neither,” Veres said. “It is not cheap because we will pay for it somehow or
another, and it’s not really food.” But, he said, remaining food-neutral is impossible: “You vote with your fork three times
a day.” Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are not mere meals, but political, environmental, and social statements. “Taste the Harvest” cultivated
the palate, urging eaters to use their utensils wisely, and to eat responsibly.
