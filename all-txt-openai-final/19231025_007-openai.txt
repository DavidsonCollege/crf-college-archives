DR. T. S. FAWCETTE

On Tuesday, October 16th, Dr. T. S. Fawcette, a Davidson Alumnus, died at a hospital in Winston-Salem, N.C. Mr. Fawcette
entered Davidson with the class of '02, but after entrance changed his course and took up his study in the
medical school, which then existed in connection with the school of Art and Science. In his after life, he continued
his medical study in the practice of surgery and medicine in Burlington, N. C. There he had as large a
practice as any doctor of that section, and had therefore endeared himself to the hearts of many who had come
under his care.

But after twenty-five or more years of service, his body began to give way beneath the continual strain, and at
the first hint of sickness, Dr. Fawcette went to the mountains of Asheville hoping to regain his lost health, and
to again take up his work in Burlington. However, there seemed to be no signs of improvement in his condition,
but rather a gradual change for the worse, so he was placed aboard a train to be carried back. When
he arrived at Winston-Salem, so critical was his condition, that it was thought inadvisable to continue the journey, and he
was placed in the hospital there, where he was visited by many friends before his death. The end came on
Tuesday, the sixteenth day of October, and brought sadness to many hearts—those who had loved him through his practice, those
who honored him as a man, and those who knew him through family ties. The sympathy of Davidson College and
Davidson men goes out to those who suffer from the passing of an honored man.

BARIUM SPRINGS CAUSE PRESENTED TO CONGREGATION

Sunday morning, October 14th, Mr. J. B. Johnston spoke to the people of Davidson, and the students of Davidson College,
about the needs and activities of the Barium Springs Orphanage. Mr. Johnston is a graduate of Davidson College, of the
class of '01. Since that time he has been engaged in Christian work of various kinds, and at present is
the manager and treasurer of the Barium Springs Orphanage.

In a few words, he set forth the financial condition of the Orphanage. He explained how and where the money
that is given to the orphanage is used. The demand is so much larger than the supply. Those who need
our help are depending on the annual gifts at Thanksgiving time to make up the deficit. He said that if
this was not done, he knew of only two courses to pursue. Either the present number of children will be
under-clothed and under-fed, or the number must be reduced. He pointed out that it would be an injustice to the
children and to society to force them to go without food and clothes in sufficient quantity. “No child can grow
to love his fellow man when he feels that he has been done an injustice. Consequently, in later years, he
will be a menace, instead of a blessing to society.”

He then told of the school activities of the children and the home-like atmosphere of the institution, and invited everyone
to come and see for himself. He told how the Barium Springs children were the first to “go over the
top” in Davidson's Campaign. They believe that Davidson will do the same for them.
