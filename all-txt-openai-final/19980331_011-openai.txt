THE DAVIDSONIAN

Wissam Boustany | Flutes for Humanity
By Wesley H. Goldsberry

World-renowned flutist Wissam Boustany and piano accompanist Greg McCallum gave one of the year’s longest concerts in Hodson Hall on Monday night, March 23. The concert served as a tantalizing hors d’oeuvre before yesterday’s Amadeus Trio performance.

The program opened with a performance of Mozart’s Sonata in B-flat Major, K.317. Boustany’s overwhelming proficiency emerged in his playing of this difficult work, serving as a prime example of the amount of virtuosity that Mozart’s concerto repertoire can demand. His completion of the piece was met by a warm ovation from the modest yet appreciative crowd.

The next piece, Hamilton Harty’s (1879-1941) “In Ireland,” provided a welcome contrast with its idiomatic jig-like passages. Boustany added much stylistic flair to this pleasant work. Cecile Chaminade’s (1857-1944) Concertino, Op. 107 could be described as “cutesy,” but did not at all undermine the soloist’s capabilities. This piece utilized several very ornate and difficult flourishes, all of which Boustany played flawlessly.

The twentieth-century trend continued with Eldin Burton’s (1913-1985) Sonatina, whose last movement, Allegro giocoso quasi fandango, was quite challenging. Boustany had clearly mastered the “quasi fandango” idiom.

Following intermission, the soloist tackled Tarek Younis’s (b. 1976) “Rising from the Ashes,” a piece written for and first performed by Boustany on his tour of the United States. Whatever was rising from the ashes in this song definitely took its time doing so, as this piece seemed to last for almost fifteen minutes. Fortunately, Younis’s composition could have been less palatable, as it made skillful use of parallel fifths and traditional Middle Eastern melodic motifs.

Schubert’s Variations on Trockne Blumen rounded out the concert. It is difficult to say exactly how many variations there were, but there were more than enough to satisfy. By the time the concert had reached its bitter end, I found myself dazed and had begun thinking in a language made up solely of flute noises. Boustany and McCallum earned a well-deserved curtain call, the audience clearly impressed with the soloist’s surpassing endurance.

Wissam Boustany was born in Lebanon and moved to England in 1977 where he studied flute at several music schools. Within six years he had won several competitions and was performing recitals worldwide. Boustany is also the founder of “Towards Humanity,” an organization dedicated to helping communities suffering from the aftermath of war. His experiences of war in Lebanon have led to his humanitarian philosophy, which he shares through his music: “Music opens the Doors of Inspiration and helps us reflect on our Common Humanity.” As a wise man once said, “True dat.” Boustany’s stellar performance featured a wide range of repertoire and performance styles, a most unique gift for the campus at large.
