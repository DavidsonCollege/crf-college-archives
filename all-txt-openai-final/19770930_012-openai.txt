Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

---

I watched a tick swell at pulsating intervals,
Slowly, subtly, beating of his threshold as its

When slashes of a burning lance ushered
Flashes of red insides through tight exits
Soon clogged by the steady veteran oozers:
Who came first but left last.

Now I can but pity you, discriminate murderer,
Who killed my substance but spared my life,
For I have lodged beneath your crusty skull
Latent trophies of push-button wars,

Wishing to remind you of that frigid day

When you smashed my soul but bade me to stay.

Yes, I am the tick wearing a purple heart
Sucking old turnips in skeletonsâ€™ beds
And you are my lover, a cockleshell

On a dry, listless beach far, far away.
