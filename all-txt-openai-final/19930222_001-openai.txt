**First Union Donates $1.1 million to Davidson**
**Campaign Reaches $112 million on Way to Goal of $150 million**
By Mandy Curtis

The First Union Foundation has given a gift of $1.1 million to Davidson College. Since the Campaign for Davidson began
in November of 1989, this has been the largest commitment to the College from any North Carolina corporate foundation. The
gift has increased the total amount of money raised to $112 million in the $150 million campaign.

The funds from First Union were granted on February 4, the day after the Charlotte leg of the national campaign
began on February 3 with an evening hosted by Mr. and Mrs. John M. Belk of Charlotte. A 1943 graduate
of Davidson, Belk is an honorary chairman of the five-year campaign to raise money for faculty positions, student scholarships, academic
resources, capital improvements, and annual operating expenses at Davidson.

According to President Kuykendall, “First Union’s wonderful gift further highlights the historic, ongoing relationship between First Union and Davidson College.”
Tony Bethea of the Institutional Advancement Office of the College added that First Union’s “terribly important gift marks the long
and very strong ties with First Union.” Top executives of First Union have been directly linked to Davidson.

**New Program to Increase Recycling in Chambers**
By Shaye Benton

Perhaps you have turned a sharp corner and run smack into one... Or maybe you have been studying late for
your first test of the semester and seen one vaguely outlined in the dark... Or at least you have sauntered
into class and casually glanced at the new additions to the hallways of Chambers. The large, blue bins located in
each hall are part of Chambers’ new recycling policy. With the current procedure for recycling, Davidson faculty and staff can
now easily and efficiently turn their trash into stash and cash. Everything now has a place — each type of
trash has its own blue bin in which to go after being used.

Chambers 223, formerly a storage closet, now houses a collection of blue bins for all recyclable products. All faculty and
staff in Chambers now separate their own trash into the appropriate bins, the contents of which are then exchanged for
revenue. Dr. David Martin, Associate Professor of Economics, has worked along with Ms. Ruth Pittard to help this project succeed.
Months ago, when many individuals noted Chambers’ need for such action, the Davidson College Recycling Committee and the Environmental Action
Coalition prepared a petition for Dr. Martin to present to the faculty. “A lot of people had been pushing for
this to happen because it was so reasonable and the time had come for this type of change,” commented Dr.
Martin.

The system improves the old recycling procedure in which students would visit each Chambers office to pick up recyclable products
and sort them on their own. This old method faced difficulty.

Physical plant workers installed this new light in front of Belk this week. Campus lighting has been a safety concern
of students, especially amid rumors of a rape on campus. See story on page 3.

**Union Board Selects Call for New Building and Quality Programming**
By Leigh Rawdon

The 1993-1994 Union Board was selected last week. The officers chose fewer committee chairs than in the past in an
attempt to establish a more unified and effective board. The chairs include students from every class and from a variety
of social and extracurricular groups. With a diverse board planning Union activities, Merrill Earnest, Union Board President, hopes “programming will
be inclusive to the entire student body but with the current social structure it is not.” He regrets that more
of the campus is not involved in Union activities. Earnest would like to see a Union which brings the Davidson
community together.what one faculty member called “a laboratory for Humanities.” But he believes the current inadequate facilities prevent growth in
this direction. Currently, the Union Board, the SGA, and a Union planning committee composed of faculty and students are working
to make the new union the next project on the campaign’s agenda. Earnest expressed the need for students to work
together to prove that there is enthusiastic support for better facilities. He encourages any stu-

Davidson through years of alumni. Edward E. Crutchfield, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of First Union Corporation, is a
1963 graduate of the College. Crutchfield stated in a recent letter from the Office of College Relations, “With this gift,
we pay tribute to the achievements of Davidson students and teachers; we recognize their strong promise for the future, and
we challenge them to surpass our expectations.” Trustee Beverly F. Dolan of Charlotte and chairman of the Campaign for Davidson
explained in the press release that because of Crutchfield’s leadership on the campaign corporate committee “we’ve had an excellent response
from corporations and foundations all across the country.” The College’s goal of raising $40 million nationally incorporate

College Planning to Build New Facilities

Potential Conflict May Arise Between Union and Life Sciences

By Tom Koonce

The Davidson College Facilities Planning Committee is in the process of reviewing proposals and preparing designs for various new buildings
on the college campus. At the forefront of their study are plans for a new College Union and a new
Life Sciences Building. The committee is also looking at plans for a new dormitory and a new track.

Planning is going ahead for a Life Sciences building which will house the departments of Psychology and Biology. This new
building is discussed in the Campaign for Davidson, but the college has approached a national foundation about funding this facility.
The college cannot conduct any more fundraising for the building until it hears from this foundation. Kevin McCarthy, Director of
Corporation and Foundation Relations, said that talks are ongoing with a national foundation to support the building. He said that
this approach is “not one that we’re optimistic about.” According to McCarthy, this specific foundation funds only two building grants
a year out of about 100 applications. If the college is not successful with this national foundation, a decision will
have to be made between a Life Sciences building or a new Union. John Kelton, chair of the Facilities Planning
Committee, said that there is obviously a “potential conflict.”

The college has recently formed a committee to look at the spaces and facilities to be housed in a new
College Union. Kelton said that the formation of this committee is “one of the latter steps towards building a Union.”
Among other things, the committee will decide what a new Union will look like and will provide an architect with
the information they need to draw up specific plans for a building. Kelton said that he believes a new College
Union would be in a “central location to student life, academics, and athletics.” He said that a decision has to
be made between whether renovating Johnston Gym (a proposal put forth a few years ago) or building a new facility
would meet the needs of a new Union best.

Kelton said that his committee is looking at a site that would put the new Life Sciences building near Martin
Chemical Laboratory and Chambers in the southeast section of campus. This is in an area at the south end of
Richardson Plaza, around the park area that is behind Martin and across the street
