Even though the record may not show it, the volleyball team had a great week. The Wildcats lost 3-0 to a tough UNC Asheville squad Tuesday, but turned things around Friday night at W. Carolina Belk Arena. The Catamounts, then third in the Southern Conference rankings, came to Davidson looking for an upset and went home disappointed after being soundly defeated in three straight games.

“This was an incredible win in which we played precisely to our game plan,” coach Lisa Marston said.

The big showdown was scheduled for Sunday against first-place Chattanooga. The first game was a tight 15-13 win for the Mocs. The Wildcats responded with a decisive 15-10 victory in the second game and took an 8-2 lead in the third. But the Mocs then staged an incredible comeback to take the third game 15-9. In the fourth game, the Wildcats fought hard and took a 15-10 decision. Just like last Sunday, Davidson went into sudden death for the fifth game. But unlike that match, the Wildcats did not come away victorious, losing 15-13.

Despite the tough loss, many team members were encouraged by the effort. “This looked like a true No. 1 versus No. 2 matchup,” Marston said. “We played extraordinarily well, and there is no way we can have our heads down about this.”

Junior Emily Willeford said that the Chattanooga game, coupled with the strong victory over the Catamounts on Friday, were “great for our confidence, even though we lost. We needed to improve on some smaller technical things, but overall, we played quite well.”

Sunday was a special day for two players. Senior L.A. Bumgarner recorded her 1,000th career kill. Her total at day’s end was 1,007. And junior Janet Duncan, whose play Sunday was “incredible,” according to Marston, recorded career kill No. 500.

“Despite this tough loss, this should help us for the rest of the season,” sophomore Ginny Quis said. “We know we can compete. And next time, we'll be ready.”

When goalkeeper Allie Noznesky has a great game and the team still loses, the opposition must have been incredible. And it was. Georgia was a rude host to the Wildcats Friday, winning 3-0 at Athens.

“They're closer to a top 25 team than any other team we've played,” coach Kevin Hundley said of the Bulldogs. “They’re much better than UNCC and they’re on par with Clemson. Their talent level — person for person — is higher than ours. The encouraging thing was that we played with intensity. Allie was phenomenal. She must have had ten to fifteen saves, and two or three that were just spectacular.”

Noznesky kept the game within reach, as the Bulldogs were only up 1-0 at the half. But the Wildcats couldn't find the back of the net, and Georgia scored one goal early in the second half and another in the last 10 minutes.

“We had a few chances and couldn’t score,” Hundley said. “We've just got to get on track offensively.”

The Wildcats now stand at 2-6-2 at the midway point in the season. Their next test will come Tuesday night at Richardson Field against another strong opponent in UNC Greensboro. The Spartans boast a 10-2 overall record, including a flawless 4-0 mark in conference play.

“They’re cruising pretty well right now,” Hundley said of UNCG.

If Davidson wins, they would still need help from another team in the form of a win or a tie with UNCG to take first place.

“We could realistically finish anywhere from second to sixth,” Hundley said. “Everybody in the conference but Greensboro has a loss, so it’s wide open.”

Hundley explained that after UNCG there is a cluster of five teams battling for second. The last two teams should only get a win by playing each other. So the battle for home-field advantage in the first round of the league tournament has begun in earnest. Whichever teams rise to the top of the conference’s middle tier will be rewarded with a postseason home game.

“We believe we can be at the top of the second tier,” Hundley said. “That’s our goal.”

The field hockey team split two games this week, defeating Catawba on Thursday 4-1 and falling to Appalachian 3-1 on Sunday.

The Wildcats racked up their fourth victory of the season against the Lady Indians of Catawba in impressive fashion. Attackers Erin Smith and Jennie Gold each tallied two goals and an assist to lead Davidson to the 4-1 victory.

“This was a fun game for us,” Smith said. “We stepped up from the start and made the most of our opportunities. I was really proud of the way the team played.” She now leads the team with 15 points, and Gold is second with nine. Sara Gebhardt did well in goal, recording 11 saves to push her season total up to 119.

“We did a good job finishing on offense today, but we let up a little on defense in the second half, which gave them a few opportunities,” coach Jennifer Blizzard Halliday explained. “Kate Schoening played a particularly strong game in the field for us.”

Sunday was a different story, as the Wildcats were beaten by Deep South rival Appalachian for the second time in two weeks. The Mountaineers opened up a two-goal lead in the first half and managed to fend off Davidson’s comeback effort in the second period. Defender Lindsey Parker scored the Wildcats’ only goal on a penalty corner midway through the second half.

“This was a well-fought battle,” Halliday said. “There was a lot of emotion out there, and it showed. We dominated the stats today, but unfortunately we couldn't convert.”

The Wildcats now go on the road for six straight games, facing a string of tough opponents in American University, Virginia Commonwealth, and William and Mary.

**Harriers place second at pre-conference meet**

Riding the momentum of solid performances in last week’s Greensboro Invitational, both the men’s and women’s cross country teams had respectable meets Saturday at the pre-conference meet in Statesboro, Ga. Georgia Southern hosted the meet that included conference rival Furman and three other non-conference teams. Both squads placed second out of six, with conference powerhouse Furman claiming first place in both the men’s and women’s divisions.

Just as men’s coach Gary Andrew predicted in the preseason, the sophomores continued to carry the team. Four of Davidson’s top five runners in the meet were sophomores. Brent Ferrell finished first for the Wildcats and fourth overall with a time of 26:46, his personal best for the season. Rookie Neil Burt, who last week registered the fastest time ever by a Davidson runner on the Greensboro course, finished only a second behind Ferrell and was the only non-sophomore in the top five. Thomas McElveen also registered a personal best, taking third for Davidson and finishing in 27:37. Pat Burchett and William Isenhour rounded out the Wildcats' top five with times of 28:06 and 28:26, respectively. Senior Tim O’Keefe was the third Wildcat to register a personal best, finishing at 28:36. Junior Rick Cratsenberg competed in his first meet of the season and finished four seconds behind O'Keefe.

Andrew stated that he was pleased with the team’s effort and the performance of Ferrell and Burt, who hung with the Furman runners the entire way.

Women’s coach Beth Puckett simply instructed her team to run hard. They did so and had satisfactory results. Puckett described the team’s performance as “a good meet, but not a great meet,” and also stated that, with improved conditioning and experience on the Statesboro course, the team could have a better finish in the conference championship.

Suzy Burr once again led the pack for Davidson, finishing in 18:53. Rookies Smyth Bitter and Jill Neumayer continued to play a crucial role for the team by finishing second and third. Kelly Kiefer came in fourth, followed by Clair Frey and Katie Lannon. The Wildcats’ point total was hurt when Allie Curran, one of the team’s best runners, did not finish the race due to the weather conditions. Without Curran, the team finished with 43 points to Furman’s 23.
