KAREN ANDERSON
IS A STATISTIC.

THE KIND OF STATISTIC
WE LIKE
TO BRAG ABOUT.

When Karen
was only 18 years
old, her doctor dis-
covered she had a
deadly form of leu-
kemia. Facing in-
credible odds, a
survival rate of
only 3%, Karen spent the next three years
in intensive chemotherapy...
Not only was her life at stake, but if she
did survive, there were serious questions as
to whether she'd be able to have children.
Now, eight years and two sons later,
you'd never suspect that this vigorous
young mother had battled a disease that
kills more than 15,000 Americans every
year.
Karen, Brian, and Erik are living proof
that we're gaining in the fight against
cancer. It's a fight we can’t afford to lose. It’s
your donations that help us continue the
research, education, and rehabilitation
programs that will give us more statistics
like Karen Anderson. The kind of statistics
we can all be proud of.

Give to the American
Cancer Society
