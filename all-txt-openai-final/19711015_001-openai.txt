**Budget Committee Distributes Funds To Organizations**

**By DOUG BROWN Asst. Managing Editor**

After much acrimony and controversy, the Activities Fee Committee of the Student Senate has finally approved the budgets for student organizations.

Last spring the Activities Fee Committee approved a budget of $10,500 for the Quips and Cranks. For the year 1970-1971, the Quips and Cranks had received $12,150 in student funds, but it was evident that for 1971-1972 the yearbook would not receive this amount. All organizations applying for funds were asked by the Activities Fee Committee to cut back on their normal requests because it was believed by the committee that requests would vastly exceed available resources.

In accordance with this request, the Quips and Cranks cut its request to $10,500 for this year, and this request was duly approved by the Activities Fee Committee last spring. The Student Senate objected to this appropriation and set a ceiling of $8,000 for the yearbook. This was the amount finally agreed upon by the Activities Fee Committee last Friday morning. The yearbook will cost each student $8.00 as opposed to $12.15 for the 1971 yearbook.

The second most expensive item will be THE DAVIDSONIAN, which requested $6,760, and this request was approved by the committee. Last year the DAVIDSONIAN received $7,475, and this cost each student $7.48. Each student will be contributing $6.76 to the operating of the newspaper this year.

The Student Government Association budget showed a rather substantial increase over previous years. The SGA request of $6,000 was approved, and this will be at a cost of $6.00 per student. Last year the SGA received only $4,900. The $6,000 figure can be accounted for by the fact that $2,000 of this went to pay for the first psychologist ever hired by students on any campus. The SGA's actual budget has been trimmed to $4,000.

The Miscellany, although increasing its budget, moved from the third to the fourth most expensive item. It had desired $5,200 but has received only $5,000. This is an increase of $500 over last year's appropriation, and The Miscellany will be produced at the cost of $5.00 per student.

The $4,750 appropriation to the Artist Series remained the same as last year's. WDAV also received a sub- (See BUDGET, Page 3)

In response to student protest over the comprehensive fee, College President Samuel R. Spencer Jr. has instructed Vice Presidents Bevan and Cornell to meet with student representatives concerning the mechanics of the proposed fee system.

SGA President Danny Clodfelter said he received a letter from Spencer which designated Vice President for Academic Affairs John M. Bevan as chairman of the meeting with students. No date for a meeting has been set as yet.

Commenting on the senate report, Spencer said that contrary to conjecture, the comprehensive fee was "discussed and worked out with considerable thought and care. We still believe that we have valid reasons for introducing this policy," he said.

Neither Bevan nor Vice President for Finance and Development C. David Cornell would comment on the senate’s report. Accompanying the report was a letter from Clodfelter which outlined his position on the issue and called for a meeting of students and the administration.

**Trustee Reception**

Both THE DAVIDSONIAN and the student Senate will be affording students the opportunity to meet informally with the trustees for discussion on Thursday. THE DAVIDSONIAN will host the trustees to supper in the cafeteria between five and six-thirty. Students are urged to pick up supper in the cafeteria line and talk with a trustee over a meal. Later Thursday evening, the senate will be the host for the traditional trustee-student reception. Refreshments will be provided.

Next week's edition of THE DAVIDSONIAN will cover the results of the trustee meeting. Distribution should be early Friday evening.

To discuss the mechanics of the proposal, “The sheer number of unanswered questions that can presently be raised in connection with the comprehensive fee is only the most salient indication that this administrative decision is one of the most poorly thought through in recent memory,” Clodfelter said. “It has all the earmarks of a hastily formed response to some pressing problem,” he continued. “Not only does this suggest that the solution itself is weak, but that the analysis of the problem is also lacking.”

Clodfelter raised a series of questions which he claimed were not provided for in the comprehensive fee as he understood it. “Why does the college insist that the board bills at the eating clubs be no less than some amount established by the college? If the house is able to operate on a lower bill, why should this be prohibited?” Clodfelter asked. He raised further questions as to whether something comparable to “half-board” at the eating clubs will be offered, and to what extent the comprehensive fee will allow the college further to conceal costs of such operations as the laundry and the food service.

“The college seems hard put to find suitable grounds for its decision,” Clodfelter said. “The alleged advantages which have thus far been brought forward either seem to be conjured up or appear to collapse in the tangle of necessary exceptions which make the comprehensive fee more complicated than the current fee system,” he said.

Confusion, Spencer Union Beer License Progress

By Jim Hanna

“Oh, it’s beer, beer, beer
That makes you want to cheer...”

Many a Davidson student has cheered over, or cried into, many a beer since alcoholic beverages were allowed on campus about five years ago. But the brew has always come from Hattie’s, Cashion’s, Chuck’s, or the Davidson Grocery. And it looks as though the Davidson man’s beer will continue to flow from those strategic points, even in the light of the North Carolina Legislature’s decision to make the on-campus sale of beer and wine legal.

Two weeks ago sophomore senator Doug Brown introduced a motion, which was passed by the SGA, enjoining the Union Board and senate to check into the feasibility of selling beer on the Davidson campus. The Union Board seems to be waiting for the senate to do something, and the senate seems to think that the Union Board has the initiative.

“The senate thought it would be best if the Union Board went ahead and got the license,” said Student Body President Danny Clodfelter. “We’ll back them up in their application for a permit, but it will be their responsibility to get the permit.” However, Social Council Chairman Duff Bruce said that “we have got to wait until the senate works out a few details” before applying for a beer permit. Union Board President Lester Strong echoed Bruce’s opinion.

“The beer thing is in the planning stages,” Strong said. “We are trying to figure out the best method of distribution, and since this has come up we've had to devote most of our time to planning activities for Homecoming.” Strong, however, said that he “doesn’t see any real problems for the beer permit, and in the near future I think we will be selling beer.”

Even if the confusion clears up, though, there is another, more formidable, obstacle in the path to beer sales at Davidson, and Strong’s optimism seems precarious. In a statement released yesterday, College President Samuel S. Spencer gave his position on the beer-on-campus issue:

“The Code of Responsibility leaves the individual free to make his own decisions about the use of alcoholic beverages within the limits prescribed by law. Beer and wine are readily available. Under present circumstances, Dr. Bevan, Dean Terry, and I do not consider it necessary or desirable for the college to sell alcoholic beverages. The Board of Trustees would have to approve something like this,” said Spencer, “and frankly, I don’t think they will. I don't like to second-guess a governing body like the Board, but I feel sure that this would not pass if put to a vote,” he said.
