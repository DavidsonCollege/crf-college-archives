**Alumni Weekend Events**

The weekend of April 18-20 is Alumni Weekend, and about 500 alumni are expected to return to Davidson for the
activities. The classes of 1926, 1931, 1936, 1941, 1951, 1961, 1965, and 1976 will be honored as reunion classes. Though
many of the activities during the weekend will be geared specifically to the alumni, several should be of general interest
to the student body. These events occur on Friday, April 18 and include:

2:15 p.m. — Reading by William Styron ‘46 in Phi Hall
3:15 p.m. — Dr. Philip Beidler ‘66 will speak on “American Literature and Experience in Vietnam” at the Carolina Inn
3:15 p.m. — The Sculpture of John Mack Walker with Dr. John Mack Walker ‘36, in the Big Screen Room
4:15 p.m. — Personal Perspectives on the Vietnam War: Porter Halyburton ‘63 and Colonel Fred Cherry at the Carolina Inn.

Student volunteers are needed to help make the weekend run smoothly. Anyone interested in helping should call Elizabeth Boone at
-6305 or Hunter Roddey in the Alumni Office.

**Resident Fellow Discusses Women in Anthropology**

By LAURA GABEL

Ernestine Friedl, Professor of Anthropology at Duke University and Resident Fellow with the National Humanities Center, spoke on women in
anthropology on Tuesday night at the Center for Special Studies. Friedl’s concern for women in anthropology developed sixteen years ago
when she was asked to join a committee on the status of women in anthropology. Although she had a personal
commitment to women’s concerns, she was not a vehement feminist like other women on the committee, she said.

It was a mystery to Friedl exactly what the problem was with women in anthropology, so she turned to statistics.
She found that the overall percentage of women in anthropology was seventeen percent. Friedl considers personal experience and women’s issues
to be intertwined. She asked questions such as: What are the roles of men and women? What is the range
of flexibility? Are men dominant? Have they always been dominant? If so, to what degree? Has the situation improved or
not? Friedl realized that more evidence and better questions were needed.

Friedl found evidence through studies of non-human primates in the wild and by studying different people of different cultures, countries,
and languages. Cocktail waitresses in a college town have also been studied. Friedl is concerned with “what people do and
what they think and say about what they do.” Friedl’s purpose was to describe some significant conclusions based on studies,
including the significance of the shift from talking about sex to talking about gender. Gender is associated with sex and
with grammatical use of words in different languages. In European languages, one must know the masculinity or femininity of a
word in order to speak correctly. In the Navajo language, one must know the shape of the object.to determine the
forms to use. Symbols for maleness and femaleness are not based solely on physical qualities, but also on arbitrary qualities.
Male and female behavior roles are based on circumstances that they find themselves in, not on physiology (by the study
of the non-human primates), Friedl said. American women are in the process of moving out of the home because of
economic need and self-fulfillment. Friedl said, “I once did an extra job in order to get a bookcase!” Society frowns
on rearing children without being there. In the 1930s women depended on grandmothers, child care centers, husbands (without telling them),
and servants. According to Friedl, “Child tending patterns are adapted to other activities.” Friedl also discussed universal facts of gender
hierarchy or male dominance. She explained that male “superiority” developed from power over materials and resources and from the symbolic
ascription of greater prestige or value to whatever men do. There are extremes, though. In Nevada, there is a group
with little or no elements of male superiority, while in Sudan women are segregated, confined in houses, and can only
see related men. Women are looking for more control outside the household over their own lives in the community. With
the advent of capitalism and large-scale industrialization, there is less to do in the home. Friedl suggests that the reason
why male activities are more prestigious has to do with the fact that women, because of the body being geared
for childbirth, are associated with nature while men are associated with culture. Friedl received her Ph.D. from Columbia in 1950.
She has been affiliated with Wellesley College, Queens College, and the University of New York. She was Dean of Arts
and Sciences at Duke University and has written several books.

would become unclassified next year. Unclassified status means that no sport would be allowed to compete in any post-season NCAA
tournament, and that after next year the NCAA would reclassify Davidson in the Division that the NCAA deemed appropriate. With
the school still searching for a conference to play basketball in after next year, unclassified status would be a tremendous
blow to any hopes for success. There also exists the possibility that we would not be placed back into Division
I at the end of the year. Faced with the specter of unclassification, Morris had no choice but to place
two more women's sports in Division I this season. A women's golf team, long considered by Davidson as a last
resort, was put together and played in a ten-team tournament. The team was not competitive, with scores ranging up into
the 130s and 150s, but they satisfied the requirement for one of the sports. That still left Davidson one sport
short, and the only solution that was left to the college was to elevate the tennis program, a move that
Kuykendall referred to as “the worst case alternative.” Morris asked the NCAA last spring for permission to classify all women’s
sports at Davidson as Division III while maintaining the men’s program at Division I. Although the service academies, who have
more total women than Davidson, were granted such permission, Davidson was refused. Morris feels that the NCAA’s lack of flexibility
was a large part of the problem. “The rules of the organization are more geared to the majority of membership
(large state institutions). The same kind of rules that in larger campuses would promote opportunities for women cause the women
on our campus to be stretched to the very limit.” The women’s tennis team hopes to be allowed to play
in the Southern Conference tournament at the end of the season, which might help ease the blow of disqualification. However,
with only two SC teams on the schedule, this is not a certainty.
