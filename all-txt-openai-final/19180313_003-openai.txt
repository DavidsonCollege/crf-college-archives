The DAVIDSONIAN, March 13, 1918

LITERARY SOCIETIES SCHEDULE

Saturday, March 16—Eumenean—
Affirmative: Harrell, Heizer, W. J. Huneycutt.
Negative: Carwile, Brand, McCutcheon.
Declamations: McGirt, McPheeters.

Philanthropic—
Affirmative: W. M. Currie, R. R. Deaver.
Negative: R. D. Hall, J. A. Poteat.
Oration: W. T. Dunlap, Jr.
Declamation: M. F. Edwards.
Extemporaneous Debate: Affirmative, W. F. Hall; negative, J. B. Caldwell.

Owing to the fact that the regular debaters were not present, both debates in the Phi Society were extemporaneous. The
query for the regular extemporaneous debate was, “Resolved, That Davidson should have a baseball team this spring.” Boney was on
the affirmative and L. L. Wilson was on the negative.

The query for the regular debate was, “Resolved, That the Presidential candidate should be nominated by a direct primary instead
of a National Convention.” R. D. Hall and M. A. Fiske were appointed on the affirmative. R. D. Freeman and
W. N. Morton upheld the negative side of the question.

The debate, because of the short notice given the debaters, showed lack of preparation and the debaters tried to make
up in near-oratory and superheated atmosphere what they lacked of facts.

The orations were both on the progress of our country in preparing for the war and they were decidedly optimistic
in their outlook. S. M. Davis spoke on “The Expansion of Our Armies.” He showed how our national army had
increased from a negligible factor to a great fighting machine. In speaking of “Some Phases of Our Aeroplane Program,” E.
G. Lilly showed how we have not only fulfilled but have excelled our aeroplane program.

In the Eumenean Society, the debate was excellent. The debaters brought out several good points and put some real old-time
“pep” in their speeches. The debaters on the affirmative side were Potts, Good, and Brand. Those opposing were Love, Liston,
and Orgain.

Following the debate, two declamations were given. L. Mahood gave “The Star-Spangled Banner” and W. P. Cumming rendered “The Immortality
of the Soul.”

EXCELLENT ADDRESS AT VOLUNTEER CONVENTION

The annual conference of the North Carolina Student Volunteer Union convened last Friday afternoon at Elon College. The formal opening
of the conference was at 8 o'clock that night when Dr. J. U. Newman conducted the devotional exercises and the
president, L. H. Hodges, of Carolina, made a few introductory remarks. An inspiring address by Dr. C. S. Usher, of
Syria, who spoke in Davidson some weeks ago, gripped an interested audience.

Saturday morning, after a prayer service and the business session, a conference on mission study and methods was led by
J. L. Murray, Educational Secretary of the Student National Movement. An impressive talk on prayer was given Saturday afternoon by
Miss Dorothy Mills, of China. Officers were then elected as follows: T. E. Rondthaller, Carolina, president; Miss Tanie Klutz, Normal,
vice-president; Miss Alma Chilton, Guilford, secretary; R. E. McClure, Davidson, treasurer. In the adoption of a constitution, a new office
was created and J. H. Hodges was appointed editing secretary.

Saturday afternoon's session closed with addresses by Dr. J. O. Atkinson, on “World Brotherhood and Ideals,” and by Dr. J.
B. Woods, on China, “The Land of Opportunity.” Rev. W. A. Wilson presented the cause of Japan, and Dr. J.
W. Bradley enthused all in an interesting and thrilling account of Medical Work in China.

Sunday morning Dr.Weatherford surprised the conference and drove home the necessity of carrying back with us the determination of improving
ourselves and our colleges. Dr. Murray spoke at the 11 o'clock service, and with the afternoon session, the conference formally
adjourned. This session was featured by the report of the resolutions committee and the findings committee. The latter was unique
in that it was to present to the conference the salient features that were to be carried back to our
respective colleges. The aim set before the Union was an increase in missionary interest and giving with the central theme
of the World Brotherhood of Missions. Interesting talks from Misses Ruth Coble and Lula Disosway and Messrs. G. A. Hudson
and R. W. Cousar. Although this closed the conference, there was an informal meeting in the evening for those who
remained over Sunday night. J. R. Woods, retiring treasurer, Cousar, Hudson, Howell McClure, and Hizer were Davidson’s delegates, and they
report an excellent conference and praise Elon for their entertainment and kindness from start to finish.
