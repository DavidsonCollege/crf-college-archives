Art Lecture Given In Chapel Tuesday
Speaker Outlines History of Carl Schurz Foundation

Mrs. Johnsen, the representative of the Carl Schurz Memorial Foundation, who is making lectures on the exhibit of German etchings and engravings now being shown in the banquet hall of Chambers, made a talk on this foundation in chapel on Tuesday morning, March 20. Mrs. Johnsen was introduced by Guy R. Vowles, professor of German.

Mrs. Johnsen started her talk by briefly outlining the life of Carl Schurz, for whom the memorial fund is named. “Carl Schurz,” she said, “was born in Germany, but after receiving an education here, he was forced to leave because of a revolution. He came to America and became very influential in American politics. He was sent as ambassador to Spain by Lincoln in 1861 and during the Civil War served as a major general in the Union Army. After the war he served as the editor of several of the country’s leading papers until he died in 1906.

“The aim of the Carl Schurz Memorial Fund is to establish better cultural relations between America and German-speaking countries,” Mrs. Johnsen continued. “The initial amount of this fund was $500,000; this was to be spent for the exchange of students, professors, and lecturers between the two countries. To this has been added the Oberlaender Trust of $1,000,000, the income from which is given to support American citizens actively engaged in research work in Germany. Dr. Howard Hanson, who wrote an opera, ‘The Merry Mount,’ which was recently produced by the Metropolitan Opera Company, received one of these grants to study German music, and to help introduce American music in Germany.”

Mrs. Johnsen ended her talk by asking the students to visit the exhibit and to vote for the picture they like best. The picture receiving the most votes will be presented to the school as a souvenir of the exhibit later in the year.

F.E.R.A. Workers Make Various Improvements

According to a recent statement by Mr. Frank L. Jackson, treasurer of Davidson College, there are at present approximately twenty Davidson students engaged in work on the campus in conjunction with the Federal Emergency Relief Administration in Washington. These men have been working for the past several weeks on various improvements on the college grounds, doing mainly general work on the campus and the golf course. They have also been helping in some of the extra painting on several of the buildings. The men who have been working were selected by a committee composed of faculty members, with especial regard to the neediness of the students. According to the rules of the administration, one-fourth of the men must be from the ranks of the new men, and, since only five men applied from this group, of necessity only twenty men in all can receive pay for the work.
