THE DAVIDSONIAN, January 22, 1920.

The largest electric sign in the world advertises WRIGLEY'S on Times Square, New York City: it is 250 feet long, 70 feet high, made up of 17,286 electric lamps. The fountains play, the trademark changes, reading alternately WRIGLEY’S SPEARMINT, DOUBLEMINT, and JUICY FRUIT, and the Spearmen “do a turn.” This sign is seen nightly by about 500,000 people from all over the world.

Red and Black Quint Begin First Trip Monday
Five Games to be Played With Leading Teams of This State

Three splendid trips are to be taken by the Davidson quint this season. The first is a five-day tour of North Carolina, beginning Monday. The team will meet the following rivals in the order named: Guilford, N.C. State, Wake Forest, Carolina, and Elon. In the past two years, the Wildcats have won only one of the three games with Guilford. N.C. State has not been on the schedule and neither has Wake Forest. The University has won games in '18 and '19, but dropped the recent one Friday night. Elon has been successfully defeated in the past two years. This will be a hard trip as there is much jumping about to do on local trains.

The Virginia trip ought not prove so tiresome on the team. The first team of the Old Dominion will be “Monk” Younger’s Hampden-Sidney outfit, on February 9, in Lynchburg. Lynchburg club comes next. Neither of these two teams have been played in recent years. Jumping to Lexington, the Wildcats meet V.M.I. and Washington and Lee. The former has lowered the local colors for two successive years, while it has been a split with Washington and Lee. The team should be in fine shape for these games, two in the Hill City, followed by two in Lexington.

The final trip will be through South Carolina, beginning February 23. The following colleges will be played: Wofford, Furman, Clemson, and University of S.C. The first two and the last named have not been met in the past two years. Clemson was defeated in '18, but was not scheduled last year. The team will arrive back on the Friday morning of Junior Speaking. The three above trips are a trio of extraordinary type and well planned, so as to give the team every possible chance for rest and the Wildcats should...be in first-class shape on all the trips. With any luck at all, Davidson should win more than the majority of the games this year, but to bring the bacon home the team and coach need the wholehearted support of the student body. So get ready to send the team off with a boost Monday when it leaves for an invasion of this State.

R. O. T. C. to Aid in Recruiting for Uncle Sam—Yellowstone Park Trip Abandoned.

The War Department is desirous of getting the R. O. T. C. to aid in a recruiting campaign that is being carried on throughout the United States. The R. O. T. C. could give exhibition drills, ceremonies, etc., that would mean trips to all nearby towns. The band would, of course, be of much aid in this work. This matter, however, must go before the faculty to determine just how much the students will be allowed to do. In the meantime, all students are requested to make an effort to recruit for the army. This can be done by making known the army advantages, with special stress to be placed on the vocational training that is now given in all branches of the service.

Due to the small number of students who could go to the Yellowstone National Park for a summer camp, the matter has of necessity been abandoned.

Students should begin to take steps to get ready for the summer camp. The place of the camp has as yet not been determined, but will be announced later.

The matter of taking the R. O. T. C. and Band to Winston for the baseball game with Carolina is now under consideration. This is one of the big games of the season and Davidson should be well represented. It is hoped that as large or larger a crowd can go than was at the football game last fall. The railroads will be back in the hands of private owners then and special rates can in all probability be secured.
