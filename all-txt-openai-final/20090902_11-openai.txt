The Wildcat volleyball team traveled to Raleigh, NC to open their 2009 season at the NC State Classic this weekend. Of the four games played over the course of the weekend, Davidson dropped all four decisions. The 'Cats’ first game was Friday, August 28 against Campbell, where the team suffered a 3-1 (25-26, 29-25, 25-22, 25-12) loss.

Leading hitters for Davidson included outside hitter Sarabeth Peele ’11 with 14 kills, Christine Perzinski ’12 with nine kills, and Jorden Benedict ’11 with eight. Also a strong component for the Wildcat offense was Hayley Lawson ’11 with 36 assists. For the defensive side, Molly Crenshaw ’13 led the way for the Wildcats with 15 digs.

The evening's second game for Davidson was against Charleston Southern where the 'Cats fell short of a win, 3-1 (25-21, 24-26, 25-20, 25-23).

Strong players for the Wildcats were once again Peele with 16 kills, Madison Benedict ’12 with 12 kills, and Anna Bradbury ’11 with 47 assists. Crenshaw picked up 12 digs for Davidson’s defense.

The 'Cats continued their weekend tournament with games against Morgan State University and NC State University on Saturday. The Morgan State Bears won the day’s first match. Leading hitters for the 'Cats included Peele and Ally Miller ’12 who recorded 14 kills each. Strong assisting plays were made by Bradbury with 31 and Ariel Ley ’13 with 18. Crenshaw once again did not disappoint on the defensive squad, managing 17 digs.

The Wildcats closed their weekend play with a decision against the tournament’s host, the NC State Wolfpack. In the weekend’s finale, the 'Cats dropped the decision 3-1 (26-24, 11-25, 25-12, 25-18). Perzinski had eight kills for the squad, Crenshaw had 12 digs, and Bradbury served 21 assists.

Peele led the way in kills with 10 for the team. For her play during the whole weekend, Peele was selected as a member of the NC State Hilton RTP Classic All-Tournament Team.

The 'Cats are on the road again this weekend as they travel to High Point University for games versus opponents Marshall, Winston-Salem State, and the High Point Panthers.

built around utilizing speed and creating confusion by applying constant pressure from its 3-4 alignment. The line will consist of Daniel Hauffe ’10 and Alex Griswold ’10, with Ellis Martin ’12 contributing at nose tackle.

Tyler Lemons ’10 will anchor the linebacking corps after leading the team in tackles last season with 91 and being named to the All-PFL Second Team.

The secondary will feature two cornerbacks with excellent athleticism but relatively little experience in Brandon Sykes ’11 and Harvey Kee ’11 (although Sykes previously saw time at strong safety). Matt Guerrieri ’11 will man the free safety position after missing last season with a torn ACL. Rounding out the secondary is John Behm ’12, a converted wide receiver who saw extensive playing time last season as a freshman.

Ben Behrendt ’11 will look to hold onto his job as starting placekicker. He began last season well, drilling a season-long 47-yard field goal on his first career attempt against UNC-Pembroke and making a 23-yard game-winner against PFL champion Jacksonville. The kick capped a 21-point rally as the Wildcats became the only PFL team to defeat the Dolphins last year.

The season opener will certainly provide a stiff challenge. Elon is ranked as highly as No. 8 in preseason FCS polls, and promises to give a rude welcome to a Wildcat team that has no scholarship players to its credit. The Wildcats remain confident, however, after completing a rigorous training camp.

“We worked much harder this year than in previous years,” linebacker Brandon Yeargan ’11 said. “We feel like we’ve done everything we can to prepare for Elon.”
