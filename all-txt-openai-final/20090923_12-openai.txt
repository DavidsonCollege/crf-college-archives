Offense finally clicks as Wildcats maul Camels 24-7 in Pioneer League opener

Davidson’s football team dominated in the second half against Campbell last Saturday to claim a well-earned 24-7 victory in their
conference opener. Kenny Mantuo ’11 led the way for the Wildcats, carrying the ball 20 times for 135 yards and
a touchdown. The offense was also paced by the efficient quarterback play of Michael Blanchard ’11, who passed for 83
yards on 9-17 passing and two touchdowns while also rushing for 91 yards. The Wildcats rushed for 268 yards as
a team. Andrew Aldrich ’10 led the receiving corps with four receptions for 41 yards and the game’s first touchdown.

The game was a tale of two halves, as the first half of action was scoreless. The Camels managed 91
first-half yards, and the Wildcats produced 103. Davidson seemed to be in position to drive for a score early in
the second quarter after Justin Williams’ ’11 27-yard punt return to the Camel 42. The chance came to nothing, though,
when Williams lost a fumble at the Camel 42.

Behind Harden ’10, men’s cross country places first at Winthrop meet, women place second

Last week the men’s cross country team opened their season by destroying the field en route to winning the Eye
Opener. How would they back up that performance? They continued their hot start to the 2009 season by taking the
top spot in the Winthrop Asics Fall Classic this past Saturday. The Wildcats held off Elon University, which finished only
two points behind the ’Cats. Davidson finished with 43 points, and rounding out the rest of the top-five team finishers
were: Elon (45 points), Western Carolina (64 points), Winthrop (92 points), and Wofford (132 points).

Individually, the Wildcats performed exceptionally well. Lance Harden ’10 finished second overall with a time of 24:59. Right behind Harden
was Ryan Hopkins ’12 with a time of 25:14. Finishing second and third overall meant one and two points, respectively,
since the top finisher, Matthew Elliott, who finished in 24:56, was unaffiliated. Rounding out the top-five individuals was a tandem
from Western Carolina, Tosey Weaver (25:35) and Stephen Hammond (25:44). Other Davidson finishers were Demetrios Paginos ’13 (13th/26:27), Peter Bruton
’10 (18th/26:37), Greg Marcil ’11 (23rd/26:51), Vincent Weir ’13 (27th/27:06), Wes Reynolds ’13 (30th/27:19), Ian Tupper ’12 (40th/27:56), Will Mitchell
’13 (49th/28:20), Daniel Bush ’13 (58th/28:59) and Ehsan Akbari ’13 (69th/29:35).

The Wildcats will look for their third consecutive victory in the 2009 season when they travel to Louisville, KY for
the Greater Louisville Cross Country Classic on October 3.

The women’s cross country team put together another impressive performance on Saturday at the Winthrop Asics Fall Classic. Just as
the men did, the women repeated their performance from their opening meet at the Eye Opener. For the second consecutive
meet, the women finished runner-up, this time finishing only behind South Carolina. In what turned out to be a three-team
battle for the top spot, the Wildcats held off Elon for second place, but were unable to track down the
Gamecocks, finishing seven points behind. The top-five team finishers were South Carolina (46 points), Davidson (53 points), Elon (56 points),
Western Carolina (100 points), and Winthrop (103 points).

Individually, the Wildcats were strong. Natalie Atabek ’13 paced the Wildcats, running the 5k in 18:43, which gave her a
fifth place finish. Lauren Childs ’11 continued her strong start to the 2009 season with an eighth place finish, running
the Winthrop University track in 18:56. Other Davidson finishers were Jane Gay ’12 (10th/19:00), Heather Connaroe ’11 (16th/19:09), Danielle Ruggieri
’11 (19th/19:20), Sarah Cline ’12 (25th/19:37), Anna Stockamore12 (40th/20:10), Caroline Gecker ’13 (45th/20:29), Haley Holway ’13 (52nd/20:40), Annamarie Armistead ’13
(66th/21:53), Hope Cain ’12 (76th/22:46) and Alyssa Moudy ’13 (84th/23:44). The Wildcats hope to break through for their first win
when they also travel to Louisville, KY for the Greater Louisville Cross Country Classic on October 3.

Davidson men’s soccer had a busy week, traveling to both Radford University on Wednesday and Presbyterian University on Saturday night.
With superior defense and two stellar offensive outings, Davidson captured two more wins to improve their record to 4-1, winning
their second consecutive road outing.

Wasting no time at all on Wednesday, Davidson came out on fire. Charlie Reiter ’10 scored quickly when Machel Turner’s
’10 initial attack was deflected by a Radford defender. Reiter collected the ball at the top of the penalty box
and fired it in to put Davidson up 1-0 just 21 seconds into the match. The duo of Turner and
Reiter were far from finished though. At the 55:54 mark, Reiter slid a pass into Turner who converted, putting the
ball inside the left post and giving Davidson the 2-0 lead. Davidson would go on to win by a score
of 2-0. Chip Sanders ’12 registered his second shutout of the season with two saves in goal. The Davidson defense
did a great job holding Radford to only nine shots all night. Reiter leads Davidson with three goals and one
assist on the season, accumulating a total of seven points.

On Saturday, Presbyterian got out to an early lead. In the 11th minute, Presbyterian’s Davis Orders headed in a free
kick cross to put the Blue Hose up 1-0. Presbyterian did not hold the momentum or enjoy the lead for
too long though because Davidson struck back two minutes later. Hunter Hayes ’12 sent a long pass downfield to Mark
Millard ’12 who fired in a 15-yard shot to respond to Presbyterian’s early score and knot the game at 1-1.
Davidson’s offensive presence was felt greatly in the first half as Davidson outshot Presbyterian 10-4. In the second half, the
story was a bit different as the Blue Hose outshot Davidson 10-7. Fortunately, this figure did not matter much. Towards
the end of regulation, it looked like overtime was imminent with the score still tied at 1-1. With 1:27 remaining
in the match, Allen Page ’12 volleyed in a corner kick from Reiter, putting Davidson up 2-1 and capturing the
victory in an exciting fashion.

Davidson improved to 5-1 on the season Tuesday night as they defeated High Point University 3-2 behind Yannick Pilgrim’s ’11
two goals. The attitude of the team is at an all-time high as they enter conference play in less than
two weeks. “Despite our slight setback against Coastal Carolina, the momentum has been building,” said Page. “We are hoping to
carry the momentum home for our match against South Carolina.” The ’Cats take on the Gamecocks at 7 p.m. on
Friday, Sept. 25.

of his career and helped Davidson improve to 4-1 on the season.
