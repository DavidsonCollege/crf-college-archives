**The Davidsonian**

March 25, 1977

When Peter Bogdanovich made *What’s Up, Doc* (1972), he was paying tribute to the films made in America in the
Thirties which became known collectively as “screwball comedies”—movies characterized by fast-moving, zany plots and highly farcical situations. The classic example
of the form was Howard Hawks’ *Bringing Up Baby*.

**Mitford speaks on prison reform**

Jessica Mitford, writer and social commentator, will speak on prison conditions tonight, March 24, in Love Auditorium at 8 pm.

She gained recognition and prominence as a social critic in her poignant attack on the funeral industry through her book,
*The American Way of Death*. This widely acclaimed documentation of the ways the American public is coerced, and eventually raped
by the funeral trade, is a stunning commentary hailed by the *New Yorker* as “a brilliant journalistic case against the
whole funeral industry.”

*Kind and Usual Punishment* is among the three other books that she has published along with numerous magazine articles. Mitford’s
thorough documentation of the prison business delves into the current situation in American prisons and their ineffectual role as institutions
of rehabilitation and reform. Citing that even wardens of the roughest prisons quote “the notion that 75 percent or 80
percent or 90 percent of the prison population could be freed tomorrow without danger to the community or increase in
the rate of crime,” she suggests it is imperative that we look at prison reform seriously.

Mitford delineates two types of reform proposals: “those which will result in strengthening the prison bureaucracy, designed to perpetuate and
reinforce the system, and those which to one degree or another challenge the whole premise of prison and move in
the direction of its eventual abolition.” The former simply perpetuates the current corruption existent in the prison field where government
funding provides little substantive reform and adds to prison bureaucracy.

Mitford is a woman of insight and sensitivity whose works reveal her sharp observation and concise commentary.

**Preview — RAM offers comedy**

1938 film *Bringing Up Baby*, which is scheduled to be shown in Love Auditorium Thursday, March 31, as part of
the Native American Movies series.

For those who have seen *What’s Up, Doc*, the plot similarities can be seen right away. *Bringing Up Baby* is
about a museum paleontologist (Cary Grant) engaged to a colleague, who becomes mixed up with a crazy rich girl, played
by Katharine Hepburn. They first meet during a wild scene on a golf course, and from then on it’s Hepburn
pursuing Grant, determined to mess up his marriage plans. Plot summary beyond that is insufficient to convey what actually goes
on in this movie; however, some of the plot ingredients (just some) are a valuable dinosaur bone, a spoiled terrier,
and several leopards, including a tamed one named Baby.

The film was directed by Howard Hawks, who miraculously managed to keep it going at breakneck speed, and, at the
same time, maintain perfect control. Hawks balanced craziness with an immaculate wit and sense of purpose; a feat Bogdanovich, years
later, was only able to approximate. *Bringing Up Baby* has to be considered one of the great American comedies of
the sound era, and has, from this writer anyway, an unqualified recommendation.

**Preview — Bad news bears in Love**

By PATRICK COVINGTON
Staff Writer

It’s springtime at Davidson, where you can hear the soft sound of a wooden bat failing to make contact with
a round white ball, and the more strident sound of a cursing outfielder dropping an easy line drive. Yes, IMAC
softball is with us again, and to help usher in the contests between Several Furry Little Animals, Off Again, SAE
#12 and the rest, Pop Films is presenting *The Bad News Bears*.

The film is about the tribulations of a sandlot team in the North Valley League in Southern California. The boys
of summer in this case are about twelve years old and their coach is a washed-out minor league ballplayer named
Morris Buttermaker (played by Walter Matthau), who makes a living cleaning swimming pools. Morris sits in the dugout, drinks boilermakers,
and watches his team lose outrageously, until a tomboy spitballer with the unlikely name of Amanda Whurlitzer (Tatum O’Neal) joins
the team. Amanda’s heroics turn the team around—and suddenly they threaten to become respectable.

*The Bad News Bears*, first released about a year ago, was directed by Michael Ritchie from a screenplay by Bill
Lancaster (Burt’s son). Perhaps the jocks among us can get pointers from this film, but whether or not you go
see it, remember: it matters not whether you won or lost, but whether that idiot remembered to bring the Schlitz.
