VOL. 1 DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N. C., APRIL 22, 1914. NO. 4

**Juniors Win in Field Day | Home Talent Play by Alumni Planning Class | Davidson Shuts Out Exercises. Graded School. Sophomores Came Second. One Other Town Items of the Week College Record Broken.**

An ideal day favored the Annual Inter-Class Track Meet on last Saturday. The track was in good form, and a large crowd was present to witness the events. The competition was keen between the Juniors and Sophs, and enthusiasm ran high, among the Sophs especially.

The meet was featured by the breaking of one college record. Norman Johnson stepped over 5 feet 10 inches, the former high jump record being 5 feet 9 inches, made in 1894 by Brown. Gilchrist broke the former record on the 220-yard dash but did not come up to his own record of 23 seconds, made last year. Gilchrist was the main point-winner for the Juniors, securing 18 out of the total 54. Johnson and Anderson followed close. Currie, Dumas, and Perry did good work for the Sophs. "Archie" Young sprung the big surprise of the day, winning both the mile and half-mile, and scoring 10 out of the 18 points for the Freshmen. The Seniors did not enter the events, although DuBose vaulted and cleared the bar at 10 feet 2 inches. Prizes for first places were offered by the town merchants.

Special efforts are being made to secure a large number of alumni at commencement. Some of the old classes are already planning reunions. Georgia Dormitory will be given over practically to the returning Davidson men, and it will no doubt be the scene of a hilarious and happy renewal of old times and memories. The class of 1909 is making definite arrangements and reservations. Mr. H. A. Query, Senior President, is sending out letters on 1909 class stationery to every man who graduated that year, and is urging him to join the big reunion on the Hill. His letter is full of spirit and enthusiasm, and should rally every '09er:

“Do you realize that it has been five years since ’09—the best that ever left the ‘Hill’—graduated from Davidson, fifty-seven strong? Do you not think that we should get together at the coming Commencement for a big reunion? We tried it two years ago, but most of the men could not come. It seems by this time that the ‘09 men could arrange their affairs so as to be present from May 16-19. There will be a big Commencement at Davidson. Can you not spare a few days and come back to the ‘Hill’ for old times’ sake? We are all wanting you and shall expect you. A copy of this letter is being sent to every man in the class whose address is available. I sincerely hope that you will come; and, if you can, will you drop me a card to that effect by May 1?”

Elliott and Christenbury. North Carolina. Tar Heels Outclassed at Every Stage in Fast Game.

Davidson has come into her own. Yesterday she met the University of North Carolina team on Wearn Field, in Charlotte, and came off victorious with the big end of a 5-0 score. The University team was outplayed from the very start. Not a runner advanced beyond second base. The Tar Heels were powerless before “Bill’s” breaking curves, three scattered hits in as many innings being all they could get off of him. The infield was slow, four errors being charged up to it. The Davidson infield, on the other hand, was air tight. “Dutch” made two beautiful stops in the seventh inning, and the rest were a stone wall. The Red and Blacks secured five clean hits off the two Carolina pitchers, two of these being two-baggers, and one a drive for three bases by Kluttz in the eighth inning, bringing in two runs.

Davidson drew blood first in the third inning. Kluttz made first on an error. Crayton sacrificed him to second. Stough was up and the Davidson rooters roared for a hit. Stough doubled over short, scoring Kluttz. Brown followed with a two-bagger and Stough came to third. Williams then tightened up and retired the next two batters. Davidson scored again in the fifth. “Pete” reached first on an error. Stough got his second hit, putting Pete on second. Curry ran for Crayton and came to third on Brown's sacrifice. Curry made a beautiful steal home. Stough slid safe at home when “Dutch” hit a grounder to the pitcher. Elliott followed and reached first, but died there when Osteen hit to K. Bailey. It was a safe lead, but the Davidson Machine was not satisfied. In the eighth Elliott walked. Then with two out Christenbury took the same route. Kluttz followed and drove a slashing three-bagger to right field, scoring Elliott. Crayton was out to the pitcher. In the ninth Carolina’s big end was retired in easy order. The game was one of the fastest and prettiest college games ever witnessed in this vicinity. The “Red and Black Machine” played errorless ball until the last of the ninth, when Somerville stopped a hit, and being off his balance.
