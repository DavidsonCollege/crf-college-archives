Gel Ready For Nov. 4th

FOR A GREATER DAVIDSON

Vol. VII.

Last of November Set for Final Show of Seniors

Senior Speaking is to take place this year on Friday and Saturday, November 28 and 29. Of course, this event would not be complete without the presence of the fair sex, so preparations for their entertainment are being brought to a rapid completion. Among the various stunts to be pulled off will be a basketball game for the class championship, and a concert by the Glee Club. The usual fraternity receptions will bring to a close the festivities on Saturday night.

With such a short time before speaking, the Senior class is beginning to tremble, and speeches are beginning to take form. Very soon the campus will be alive with midnight orators and a continuous muttering will identify any member of the class of '20, who are about to make their last attempt at slinging the well-known “Taurus.”

Davidson? V. M. I.?

Teams About Evenly Matched—Hard Battle Expected

With three victories and two defeats so far this season, the Wildcats journey up into Virginia again this week to meet Virginia Military Institute in Roanoke. The team will go into the game with plenty of fight, in order to avenge themselves for the defeat of two weeks ago by the only other Old Dominion eleven they will meet this year. A hard-fought game may be expected as the Cadets have a wiry and fast team this year. After having soundly trounced the Red and Black basketball team, they will be out with every ounce of strength to win in football also.

The two teams are very evenly matched with a possible edge in favor of Davidson, which is offset by the fact that Black is out of the game for a while with a broken hand and that the game will be played on the opponents’ field. It is rather difficult to compare the relative strength of the two teams as neither have met a common enemy this season. However, in an indirect comparison, it will be seen that the Wildcats have a slight advantage. Washington and Lee seem to have a better team than the U. of Va., as demonstrated by the decisive way in which the Generals beat Randolph-Macon, while the University was able to score only two touchdowns. However, the University won from V. M. I. 7 to 0 and from this, it would appear that Washington & Lee would have little trouble in beating the Cadets.

But to come down to Davidson’s chances, the difficulty which the Generals experienced in scoring on the Red and Black would prove that Davidson has a slight edge on V. M. I. Also, remember the shock which “Monk” Younger and his Tiger clan from Hampden-Sidney threw into the Cadet camp when they held the V. M. I. eleven to a 3 to 3 score. The fact that the University of Virginia only won from V. M. I. by a single touchdown ought not to discourage Davidson supporters.

Last Saturday was a bad day throughout the South for football on account of the muddy fields. Virginia has a weak team this year, being unable to score on Richmond College and only putting across one touchdown on Randolph-Macon by straight football, the other line score being on a fluke. The teams will probably line up as follows:

Davidson. Position. V. M. I.
Miley........... LE....... Clark
Hammett........ LT ...... Dabney
Romefelt........ LG...... Harrison
Brady........... C........ Smith
Davis........... RG...... Shipley
McMaster....... RT .... . Summers

Yes, we are speaking of that game Saturday in which rain, mud, Gamecocks, and Wildcats were all mixed up in one big mud-pie from which a bunch of almost unrecognizable yet jubilant Wildcats emerged as victors.

After many of the fans had about conceded that the football contest between Davidson and the University of South Carolina would be a deadlock with the count 0 and 0, the Red and Black machine began to work in its accustomed manner, and scored a touchdown in the last 70 seconds of play.

Playing the first half in a drizzling rain and muddy field, neither side was able to score or greatly endanger her opponent’s goal. The rain having ceased, both teams came onto the field at the beginning of the third quarter determined to make a count. Carolina was the first to come within striking distance of the goal. At the beginning of the fourth quarter, she rushed the ball to Davidson's eight-yard line, where she lost it and at the same time lost her only chance of scoring. The Wildcats then began to work hard and the terrific line plunges of Black soon carried the ball to the 22-yard line. Here Spann, aided with almost perfect interference, carried the ball over for the only touchdown of the game.

For Carolina, Max McMillan was the outstanding star. The big tackle repeatedly broke through the line and threw Davidson backs for losses. On the offensive, McMillan made openings in Davidson's line that allowed Carolina’s backs to shoot through. Black was the star of Davidson. With a bone in his hand broken, this great player, with powerful plunges, tore through Carolina’s line for good gains. Spann ran the team as only Henry Spann can.

First Quarter.

Davidson won the toss and chose to receive. Smith for Carolina kicked 38 yards to Johnson, who returned 8. Davidson’s ball on her 30-yard line.

Tennis Tournament to be Held Next Week
Winners to Have Intercollegiate Match
Commissary Offers Prize

With enthusiasm for athletics at its height, centered around the record being made by the football eleven, the Tennis Association makes the announcement that tennis will soon make its appearance on the scene. The fall tournament will begin Monday, October 27. Those desiring to participate in the play must have their names entered by noon on Saturday, October 25. Both doubles and singles will be played. As an inducement to secure entries for the tournament, the Commissary has offered a box of tennis balls of a well-known brand. It is stated that at least one trip will be made by the winners; it is probable that more will be made. Davidson should this year have one of the best tennis teams in its history. Frank Hall, last year's single champion, has returned to college after a summer's play at the University of Virginia. Tom Hawkins, who won the tournament in 1917, is back now and will make it quite interesting for anyone that meets him. Hall and Spence, who have held the doubles championship for two years, will play together again, and from all appearances will make an extraordinary showing. The McKeldin brothers will make a strong combination in the partner event. The draw will be made next Saturday afternoon, and remember that all entries must be made before noon on that day.

The following prizes have been offered in the tennis tournament, according to Manager Spence:
One Emblem by W. S. Henderson.

THE LAME, THE HALT, THE BLIND, MUST MAKE UP DRILLS.
The ruling of the war department that all delinquents in drills or physical exercises in any R. O. T. C. camps should make up the drill in extra time was put into effect here last Thursday. Sergeant Caroll had charge of the delinquents, which numbered about thirty, and drilled them for an hour in the different lines of instructions they have received since the beginning of the term. Sergeant Caroll stated that the men who are absent from any drill or exercise will be held responsible for the same and will be required to drill one hour for each charge against them. Another drill will be held as soon as a sufficient number of absentees have occurred to justify it.

FAMILY REUNION.
Mrs. B. H. Easley, of Clarksville, Va., is spending some time with her daughter, Mrs. M. E. Manning. Also, Miss Louise Manning, of Washington, D. C., is spending her vacation at home. Mr. W. H. Manning, ex-’13, and family, of Barnwell, S. C., spent the weekend with his mother.

Excellent Entertainment Enjoyed by Everybody
Rich-Werno Company First Lyceum Attraction—Hearty Applause of Large Audience Shows Its Appreciation

The Rich-Werno Company, the opening attraction of the Lyceum course, was presented in Shearer Hall last Wednesday night at 8:30. A large crowd of both college boys and townspeople were entertained and delighted for an hour and a half by the talented and well-known artists. The company was composed of two ladies, Miss Rita Rich and Miss Laura Werno. They opened their program with Miss Rich singing the well-known selection, “Cherry Ripe,” accompanied by Miss Werno, followed by “The Ballad of the Lost Ford." This was enough to win the hearts of the audience, causing considerable applause, which was characteristic of the entire entertainment. Miss Rich soon gained admiration by her most attractive and winning manner. Miss Werno, the clever pianist, convinced the audience of her unusual recitative ability by rendering a familiar selection. This was followed by Miss Rich’s clever impersonations of old and modern customs and music. Her childhood philosophy was also very admirably staged. Miss Werno next gave the most talented and interesting number of the evening, Henry Van Dyke's beautiful little story, “The Mansion.” She held the audience in a trance, as it were, during the entire reading. The tone of the program was next changed to the rendering of a number of Scotch ballads by Harry Lauder, Miss Rich impersonating the world-famous comedian. Among the selections there were “I Love a Lassie,” “Every Laddie Loves a Lassie,” “It’s Nice to Get Up in the Morning, But It’s Nicer to Lie in Bed,” and “Roamin’ in the Gloamin’.” The scene then changed to the impersonating of life in Japan and China, with appropriate costumes and music, including the popular song hit, “Chong-Chong.” After a short interlude, the program was continued with the presentation of a number of amusing Irish songs, both artists dressed in the garb of the Emerald Isle. Miss Werno then gave a very comical dialogue of the conversation of an Irish couple at an American game of baseball. The program ended with two popular American song hits, “Mickey” and “Jim.” It was a delightful entertainment, sparkling with fun and enriched with good music.
