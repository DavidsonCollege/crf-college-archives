### First home victory of 2000

The only thing more explosive than Wayne Bernard’s fist-pumping cheers from the floor was his perfect 6-for-6 streak of free
throws in the waning minutes of Tuesday night’s tango with Western Carolina. With a minute to go and Davidson’s fragile
two-point lead in peril, Western’s Leon Davis fouled Bernard.

“WHOO!” thundered Bernard, his clenched fists reaching for the rafters. After holding his mighty stance for a moment, he connected
on two free throws that put Davidson up by four again at the one-minute mark. Davis made good with a
jumper from the corner that brought the resilient Catamounts to within one with 30 seconds remaining. The ball fell into
Bernard’s hands again with only 19 ticks left and the Catamounts had no choice but to send him to the
line — and wince as they watched him push the Wildcats' lead to three, 81-78. That was enough for the
“W,” but Landry Kosmalski iced the victory with two more free throws to end the game, the Wildcats’ first Southern
Conference home win of the season.

The dramatic finale was a fitting ending to what had been a choppy game for the Wildcats. After falling behind
early by as much as 10 points, the Wildcats spent the first half fighting to even the score by halftime.
When a Jeff Bergmann jumper went up with only seconds remaining in the period, the ball scooted off the rim
but Kosmalski promptly returned it to the basket, tying the score at 31 as the first half buzzer roared.

“I think we come out of the gate with great energy,” coach Bob McKillop said, “but we are very premature
in terms of some of our offensive decision making. Until we get a little bit more mature about our offensive
decision making early on, or make a heck of a lot of shots early on, we are going to struggle
to get out of the gate.”

By midway through the second half, however, the Wildcats had jumped ahead by 10 and appeared to have the Catamounts
under control. But the Catamounts, who had rallied earlier in the season to beat Nebraska and Columbia on the road,
dialed in a comeback and delivered in 8 minutes, knotting the score at 75 with two minutes remaining. After that,
it was all Wayne Bernard, whose career-high 22 points included a perfect 10-for-10 performance from the line, six of which
came in those last two minutes. The clutch free throws were as important as the energy Bernard injected into the
game and his teammates all night long. And it was quite contagious, too, spreading through the crowd until every fan
was out of their seat in the closing minutes.

“I try to bring a lot of energy,” Bernard said following the game, “but I still want to stay humble
at the same time. I don’t want people to think I’m cocky. I just try to bring a lot of
energy to the team.”

### Erege, Halbauer out for season

Emeka Erege will not play this season. Due to a slow recovery from a leg operation this summer, the 6-foot-5
forward won't suit up for the Wildcats in 1999-2000. He’ll return next year with two years of eligibility remaining. The
decision was made jointly by the coaching staff, team doctors and trainers, and Erege.

“By late December when I hadn’t played in any games and I wasn’t ready yet,” Erege explained, “I felt it
was better to not play at all.”

Erege had a rod inserted in his lower left leg after he broke his tibia and fibula against Western Carolina
in January of 1998. He had that rod removed last summer. The third-year player from Berlin, Germany, experienced the beginnings
of a stress fracture early in the fall. Erege started much of last year as a sophomore and averaged 7.1
points and 4.4 rebounds a game. He was scheduled to be the Wildcats’ only senior in 2000-2001.

In another blow to the Wildcats, senior guard Davor Halbauer will spend the remainder of the season recovering.from an ACL
tear he suffered at College of Charleston. “It’s tough with Davor out right now,” said Jeff Bergmann. “We're all having
to step up a lot to make up for that loss.” Halbauer averaged 6.5 points and 2.2 rebounds per game
in 11 contests this season.

After finishing its second straight campaign with a school record-tying eight wins and seven consecutive victories, the Wildcat football team
placed four players on post-season teams. Ryan Crawford became only the second player in school history selected to the Associated
Press I-AA All-America First Team. Johnny Mackorell earned the same honor in 1934.

“When you're in there with the rest of I-AA football, it’s the highest compliment you can get,” head coach Tim
Landis said.

Crawford, a 6-2, 176-pound junior from Newton, N.C., stayed busy in the backfield harassing opposing quarterbacks as well as wreaking
havoc from his corner spot. He led all I-AA players with eight interceptions, broke up 10 passes, and registered 67
tackles. As a team, the Wildcats’ defensive backfield led all I-AA teams with 28 picks.

“Ryan would tell you that a lot of his success was a result of our defense, and the entire unit,”
Landis explained. “The scout work he was getting from some of our younger players made him a better player.”

His spectacular special teams play — he blocked five punts in ‘99 — helped the team win close games, including
at Randolph-Macon, where he returned a blocked field goal 69 yards for a touchdown. In the Wildcats' first-ever win at
Centre, he blocked two kicks, intercepted three passes, and made 10 tackles.

“For an individual, that’s the highest honor you can get here,” lauded defensive coordinator Tripp Merritt, who said pro scouts
have already shown an interest in Crawford. “He’s one of the best athletes we’ve ever had here. The scary thing
is, he’s only gonna get better.”

Ryan’s fire stems from his athletic ability and competitive desire, but he gets an extra boost from his twin brother
Corey who plays running back and wide receiver.

“They carry something together,” Merritt said. “They’re always jabbing each other about who’s the better athlete, who’s the better basketball
player, who’s the strongest in the weight room, it’s constant.

“But that healthy, brotherly love that they show each other has made them better. They’ve pushed each other throughout their
entire careers.”

At a school known for its academic rigor, senior fullback Eric Ferguson became Davidson’s first Academic All-American when he was
named to the GTE Academic All-America Football Second Team. After a 975-yard season, Ferguson finished his stellar Wildcat career as
the school’s second all-time leading rusher with 2,791 yards. He also tied Ray Sinclair, the school’s career rushing leader, for
career touchdowns with 33. And he broke the school scoring record by amassing 202 career points.

Ferguson's honor places him in an elite group that includes players from such football powerhouses as Nebraska, Penn State, and
Michigan.

“I don’t think Eric could receive a higher honor,” head coach Tim Landis said. “And this just puts another feather
in his cap for his collegiate career.”

Also, defensive tackle Bo Henderson, punter Daniel Hanks, and Crawford, earned spots on the NCAA Division I-AA All-Independent Team, a
group that represents 16 I-AA teams, including fourth-ranked Hofstra. Henderson anchored the defensive front with 96 tackles — including 19
for a loss — and four sacks. Hanks earned honors as a place kicker, but he also handled punting and
kick-off duties for the Wildcats. He nailed nine field goals tying a school record, and made good on 28 of
29 extra point attempts.

The post-season honors have energized the football office and promise a lot for next year. All of the award winners
except Ferguson will return to the roster next year.

“Between Bo Henderson up front, Sam Fraundorf as a linebacker, and Ryan Crawford in the backfield, we’ve got the chance
to be pretty good,” Merritt said. “The guys are gonna work hard. I’m excited... I’m probably as excited about this
season coming up as I was about this season.”
