Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

---

street of the Lonely

Windows and exits blotch

dingy buildings, contorted concrete blocks.
Dirty snow drips into a gash,

an arm of water the length of the road.

Black leaded rooftops drive

into a monument, a smokestack
at the head of the street.
Beneath the smokestack

a stranger

bundled in black fur.

Closer to the foreground

a woman,

arms crossed, body-whipped, hair
flying about her face.

She holds to her shadow.

The composition fixes her

in a whirl of gray,

but the swirl threatens and may
wrench her yet

straining from the wall!

—from Rouault’s “La Rue des Solitaires”
