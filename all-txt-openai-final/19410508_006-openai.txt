Diamondmen Defeat Wofford; Lucky 7th Gives Hurricane Win

Davidson's nine broke even over last weekend with a win over the Wofford Terriers and a loss to Furman.

Against Wofford on Friday, Ed handed the Terriers seven hits from which they garnered five runs. Calvert held Wofford to one hit ball until the sixth, after which he allowed 11 safeties and six runs.

TERRIERS LEAD

The Terriers held a three-run lead until the seventh when the Wildcats scored on singles by Yarborough, Edmundson, and Carter to hook the count. Lucas tripled to open the eighth and scored the winning run on Daffin's third hit of the day.

Against Furman on Saturday, Reinhardt opened on the mound and shut the Hurricane out for five innings, gave them a run in the 6th, three in the seventh, before Morris replaced him in the eighth, when the Palmetto boys tallied eight runs on six safeties.

CATS GET SINGLES

Against Byers’ offerings, the Cats were able to get only five singles during the afternoon. Edmundson got two for two, hitting well in the clutches, and scoring twice, and was the Cats’ individual star. Powell, Furman receiver, smacked three singles to lead the Hurricane hitting; Hicks had a double and a triple.

The Cats met S. C. here Tuesday afternoon.

EXAMINATION SCHEDULE
Second Semester, 1941

P.C., Lenoir Defeat ’Cat ‘Racketeers

The track team lost a one-sided meet to the Charlotte Wildcats, the state high school champions, at Charlotte last Friday by a score of 83-33. The high school team swept the running events and one of the field events, placing first, second, and third in these four events. In all, the frosh placed first in only three of the thirteen events.

LACY HIGH

Bill Lacy, consistent point winner for the Kittens, was again high man, scoring 11 points. Lacy placed first in the low hurdles, tied for first in the high jump, and placed second in the high hurdles, hundred yard dash, and in the broad jump.

Dick O'Hair, Davidson's only entry in the pole vault, captured first place in the event with a vault of ten feet, one inch. Bob Hutcheson placed first in the discus with a hurl of 110 feet, eleven inches. Other point winners for the freshmen were Port, White, and Dabney.

This meet was the last of the season for the Kittens, giving them a record of one win and three losses. The freshmen scored their single win over Boyden High of Salisbury.

Kit Golfers Pick Nine in First Win

The Central golf team defeated the frosh linksmen for the second time this year. Playing in Charlotte on Tuesday of last week at the Carolina Golf course, Tommy Bumbarger of Davidson and Don Bryant of Central tied for medalist honors with 73's, three over par.

The Davidson freshmen took their first win of the 1941 season by thrashing Cornelius Saturday 7-2 on Richardson Field. The Kittens took advantage of all opportunities in the first, third, and eighth innings. The pitching of Ed Major was probably the outstanding feature of the Davidson attack, allowing only a few hits and scored.

BRUCE HITS

Mac Bruce led the hitting for the frosh with two safeties while E. Major connected for a homer. Friday the Kittens lost to Central High of Charlotte 22-2, the game being called in the seventh. The Davidson hurlers gave a total of eighteen bases on balls, allowing the visitors a goodly number of unearned tallies.

BROOKS HOT

Brooks, Charlotte pitcher, gave the frosh only five hard-earned hits and was the leading slugger for his team.

Match Pikas, Phi Delts Lead Inter Fraternity Race

The Pikas and the Phi Delts with perfect records are leading the interfraternity softball tournament after the fourth round. The Phi Delts have won but three games, being inactive on one day, and the Pikas have won four.

In a thrilling pitcher's duel Thursday, Joe Shelton bested Jay Bolin to give a 2 to 1 drubbing to the Phi Gams. In other games that day, the Pi Kapps beat the Kappa Sigs, the Phi Delts outscored the Betas, and the K. A.’s defeated the S. A. E.'s. On Monday, the Phi Delts conquered the Pi Kapps, the Pikas defeated the Betas, the S. P. E.’s beat the K. A.’s and the Phi Gams licked the Kappa Sigs.

MORNING—9:00 A. M. DATE AFTERNOON—2:00 P. M.

On Thursday, the Davidson College tennis team was host to the Presbyterian College netters from Clinton, S.C. The Cats made a determined bid to eke out the Blue Hose strokers but Coach Lufler’s team was defeated: Davidson 9-0.

KERDASHA ABSENT.

The Presbyterian racketeers were unable to bring their ace, Robert Kerdasha, but Billy Farmer, the lad who substituted for him, filled the slot very capably. Farmer took Vitti to the tune of 6-2, 3-6, 6-3.

Out for a victory, the local netters journeyed over to Hickory to engage the strong Lenoir-Rhyne team. It was a nip and tuck match and after the scores had been compiled Davidson was the loser 4-2.

SCABBARD AND BLADE

On April 16, Scabbard and Blade held the annual election of officers. The men elected will make up the staff which will carry on the work of the organization for the next year. The following officers were selected: Walter Wooten, Captain; Jack Philips, First Lieutenant; Pat Rudolph, Second Lieutenant, and Frank Caldwell, First Sergeant.

Of special interest was the awarding of a medal to the best drilled freshman in the Davidson R.O.T.C. unit. This award was presented to Tom Milliken this year. Jay Bolin was presented a cup which is offered to the leader of that platoon judged best. Both are given by Scabbard and Blade.

WITH THE GOLFERS

Right from the tee-off, you'll like their COOLER, MILDER, BETTER TASTE. Smokers get every good quality they like in Chesterfield’s famous blend. This right combination of the best tobaccos that grow in our own Southland and that we bring from far-off Turkey and Greece truly SATISFIES. Make your next pack Chesterfield... you can’t team-up with a better cigarette. Everybody who smokes them likes them.
