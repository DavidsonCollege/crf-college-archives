Nix Outlines Court Program (Page Four) VOL. XLVII Executive Committee Accepts Davidsonian The News and Editorial Voice of Davidson College DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N. C. FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 26, 1958 Peanuts Is Back (Page Two) NO. 3 Vesper Exemption Proposal Folk Singer To Open Artist Series Oct. 24 The Davidson College Artist Series for the season 1958-1959 will consist of seven performances representing various types of entertainment led by eminent artists such as Vincent Price and Nell Rankin. All performances will be staged in Chambers Auditorium with tickets available for interested persons in the area. An informal reception in the College Union will follow each performance, giving interested students the opportunity to meet the various artists and become further acquainted with them. The committee responsible for procuring these artists includes Mr. Donald Plott, Mr. C. Shaw Smith, Dr. P. N. Trakas, Mr. Arthur Griffin, and Dr. James Causey. They have made an effort in most instances to choose fresh, young talent, well-known in music circles but not yet foremost in the public’s eye, as the quality of their performance is usually higher than that found among the established artists. The first performance will be on Friday, October 24, Homecoming Weekend. At that time Richard Dyer-Bennet, nationally known minstrel and guitarist, will present a program centered around the world’s great traditional songs. Mr. Dyer-Bennet was born in England, but has spent most of his life in America, where he is known as a composer and lyric tenor. On November 7, Nell Rankin, Mezzo-soprano of the Metropolitan Opera, will perform. She is now considered the leading Carmen on stage. David Bar-Ilan, the Israeli pianist well-known on the campus due to his concert here in 1956, will star in a repeat performance on Friday, December 5. The Players, Inc., from Catholic University in Washington, D. C., in their second theatrical appearance here will present “Oedipus Rex” on February 20. Vincent Price, well-known star of stage, screen, and radio will appear on March 2 in a dramatic presentation, the content of which is as yet unknown. On March 20 the Eastman String Quartet of Rochester, New York will perform in a varied evening of quartet literature from four experienced teacher-performers. The last evening of the series on April 2 will feature the dance satirists Mata and Hari. Their recital will consist of “The World in Pantomime.” The series has been considered a very successful undertaking in past seasons and an even greater reception is anticipated this year.

Excuse Juniors Sunday; Seniors Out Next Week By CHARLES CHASTAIN Davidsonian Associate Editor The Executive Committee of the Faculty today accepted a resolution of the Religious Life Committee that juniors be exempted from Vesper attendance this Sunday, and seniors the following Sunday. The measure was enacted to give temporary relief to the problem of overcrowding during the Sunday evening services, after overflow crowds at the first Vespers of the year forced over one hundred students to take seats outside the sanctuary, in Lingle Chapel and in the narthex. The decision of the nine-man Executive Committee came after an emergency meeting at eight o'clock this morning in order to debate and vote on the proposal of the Religious Life Committee, which met for more than two hours in closed session yesterday afternoon.

Hutson To Speak At Vespers Sunday The vesper speaker for Sunday evening, September 28, will be Dr. Harold H. Hutson. Dr. Hutson is now the president of Greensboro College in Greensboro, North Carolina. He began his education at Wofford College in Spartanburg. Upon graduation, he studied theology and philosophy at Duke University. Dr. Hutson then attended the University of Chicago where he received his Doctor of Philosophy degree. After having served a number of years in the Methodist ministry, he joined the faculty at Greensboro College as professor of philosophy.

Philanthropic Society Will Meet Monday Philanthropic Literary Society, launching a new year with its first meeting at 8 p.m. on Monday evening at Phi Hall, will hear Dr. and Mrs. George B. Watts speak on their recent European summer. Ralph Wilson, society president, said “We're looking forward to a big year. I hope the entire membership will be present for our first meeting.”

Construction of Davidson’s new Dana Laboratories is expected to begin on October 2 with groundbreaking ceremonies and the launching of a new college fund drive, “The Dana Challenge Program.” The groundbreaking ceremony, planned for the chapel hour on next Thursday, will bring to the campus a number of Trustees and program committee chairmen as well as the donor of initial funds for the building, Mr. Charles A. Dana, of Wilton, Connecticut. A platform and seating space will be placed at the building site for the program. Music will be provided by the Male Chorus and the College Band. Activities will be highlighted by the breaking of ground and an informal talk by Mr. Dana. Dana, an automotive parts manufacturer and president of the Dana Foundation, visited the Davidson Campus last spring and later donated $400,000 to the college, to be used for construction of a new science building and dormitory. A stipulation of the grant was that the college raise an additional $600,000 for the project.

Pictured above are Ed Armfield (left), DAVIDSONIAN Managing Editor, and the Rev. Billy Graham (right), world-renowned evangelist. Armfield interviewed Rev. Graham after the second revival service of his Charlotte Crusade Monday night. Graham Says College Students Lack Ideology “I would say that the one great need of American college students is to find an ideology and philosophy that can be accepted intellectually and then complete dedication to that ideology.” So spoke Dr. Billy Graham in an exclusive interview with the DAVIDSONIAN after delivering an address to a capacity crowd at the Charlotte Coliseum Monday night. The Coliseum itself had taken on a new face for the Charlotte born evangelist. Hanging over the basketball scoreboard, high in the center of the great dome, were signs quoting scripture. All around the guard rail which encircles the floor were blue and yellow drapes, as well as around the specially constructed platform. The crowd itself looked no different from other crowds, but the Crusade Choir in blue robes was a new sight. Since Dr. Graham’s schedule was so tight, it was decided to have the interview there. Dr. Graham, after remarking that, “Charlotte is about the hottest place I've ever tried to preach,” answered the following questions and made the following observations: Q. Do you have any plans to visit Davidson during your Crusade? Would you have any comment to make on church-supported schools as opposed to state universities? A. Well, I don't know. My schedule is quite full, but I do hope to get a chance to visit Davidson. Q. Do you think Bible courses should be required on the college level? A. That depends on who is teaching the course. Some have lost faith in Bible classes because of professors who have stressed the negative side, or those things which one cannot believe. The emphasis should rather be on faith in Christ.

Davidsonian Managing Editor “The committee studying the formation of an Honor Council is planning to submit its proposal to the Student Council next Monday evening.” These were the words of Student Body President John Kuykendall in a DAVIDSONIAN interview last Wednesday. “The committee,” Kuykendall went on, “is composed of Dave Robinson.Bob Livingston and myself. The Council hopes to have a finished plan ready for presentation to the student body by the first of November.” Queried as to the one-month delay, Kuykendall replied, “We feel that such a step is a very important one, and we want to be sure that the plan is what we want. I think that our present set-up is inferior to an Honor Council, but there is not too much urgency on action. Our present plan is to have the Honor Council go into effect at Spring Elections; to avoid the complications we would face if it were started in mid-year.”

GUIDANCE

Question: What about the period of advice or guidance?

Answer: We still plan to go through a short period of guidance. Furthermore, we hope to make the arrangement flexible enough so that after two or three years, the Council can be re-evaluated and modified in certain respects if necessary.

Question: What is the Student Council's stand on the freshman riots this year?

Answer: We are interested in the show of class spirit, but definitely opposed to any defacement of school property. If the riots continue, and if they are as violent as they have been, the Student Council and the Court of Control will be on hand to take judicial action if needed.

Question: What about the faculty regulation concerning firearms in the dormitory? Is the Council planning to perhaps strengthen this regulation by action of its own?

Answer: No. I don't think that it is necessary that the Council take a stand on this matter. It is a matter of spreading the Council’s authority too thin. It is certainly a problem, but one we hope will resolve itself.

Question: There has been talk on campus about the new fraternity court being conducive to drinking on campus. Is the Council planning any close supervision this year?

Answer: No, we aren't. The supervision will come from us and from the faculty at the off-campus parties during the dance weekends. I’m afraid that we are in danger of losing that traditional privilege and I hope that the fraternities will use their heads at their off-campus parties.

Question: Do you plan to make any modifications in the elections system next spring?

Answer: I hope we can liberalize the system somewhat. This is certainly not to say that we will adopt a “no-holds-barred” system, but I do hope we can adopt a way to give candidates more chances to express their positions.

Pictured above is an artist’s conception of the Dana Science Laboratories, funds for the construction of which were donated by Mr. Charles A. Dana of Wilton, Connecticut. Mr. Dana plans to be at Davidson for ground-breaking ceremonies scheduled for Thursday, October 2, at 10:15. Friends of the college match his gift with equal funds—a “challenge grant.” The challenge prompted a campaign entitled “The Dana Challenge Program” which is now gaining momentum under the direction of Presidential Assistant Sailstad and a group of alumni chairmen. The Dana Laboratories, according to Sailstad, will be ready for occupancy sometime during the 1958-1959 school year. It will house the Biology and Physics Departments. The present Martin Building will be used for the chemistry department. The new building will greatly ease the cramped laboratory and classroom conditions. The improvement will also show itself in more liberal arts classrooms in the north wing of Chambers, now occupied by the physics department. “We hope to occupy the building early in 1958-59,” said Sailstad, “but how soon depends on many factors. No exact date has been set.”

Jean Paul Sartre has said, “Man is so psychologically made that he needs something to which he can cling.” I think that history bears out the fact that Christianity is the most successful ideology and philosophy that can be accepted intellectually, and then complete dedication to that ideology. I don't see why that philosophy can’t be true Christianity—it should be.
