Husband And Wife Calling Off Dances Was Right Decision

The administration’s decision to call off the Homecoming festivities was the only logical alternative. With Asian flu cases mounting by the hour, it would be risky indeed to predict the state of affairs come Friday and Saturday. Even tonight the number of cases has reached the point where class instruction is almost ineffective. Who knows what the situation will be tomorrow. By calling off the dances, the administration has lessened the possibility of numerous complications. It means that many students will not experience the unhappy plight of having their date call at the last moment to say that she too has the flu. It means that the residents of Belk dormitory will not have to move into close quarters. Already many flu victims are recuperating in their dormitory rooms.

The manner in which the administration came to its decision is highly commendable. Dr. Pietenpol, Dean Bailey, Mr. Martin, and other officials met with the Student Council yesterday afternoon to get student opinion. Then last night, Dr. Pietenpol met with the IFC to see how they stood on the matter. This morning a joint meeting gave its backing to the administration’s decision. In the end, of course, the decision was up to the college officials. But the fact that student feeling was asked for is another example of the pleasant relationship that exists between the faculty and students. And not to be overlooked is the most generous offer from the Treasurer that the college will try to help meet half of the financial obligations of the IFC in its contract with the dance band. Weighing all factors, the college had little choice but to call off the dances.

Abrams’ Team Display Art

Two exhibits by a vital husband and wife art team will be on display at Davidson College from Friday, October 25, to Friday, November 8. Oil paintings by Mary Tatum Abrams and woodcuts by Ross Abrams will comprise this exciting show, assembled by Douglas Houchens of the college Fine Arts Department. Seen on display in the Foyer of Chambers Building on the Davidson campus will be the oil creations of Mrs. Abrams. Her work has been circulated by the American Federation of Arts and the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts granted her a traveling fellowship in 1951-52. Since then, Mrs. Abrams has become increasingly recognized as a significant young experimental painter. A selective group of woodcuts illustrating Victor Hugo's Toilers of the Sea is Ross Abrams' contribution to this twin exhibit. These prints are on display in the Lobby of the College Union and are a part of a larger group which will be on view in Chambers Building Foyer during December. Mr. Abrams was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for creative work with the color woodcut in 1951-52.
