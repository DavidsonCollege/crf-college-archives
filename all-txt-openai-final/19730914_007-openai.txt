#### They Could Have Told You. D.C. Needs No Introductions

The Class of 1977 began its association with Davidson’s brand of higher education on the first of September. That was
the day they filed into the ROTC tent by Richardson Dorm for photos, fees, and forms.

Mother Nature could not have picked a more hot and humid day for the climbing of endless stairs with innumerable
footlockers, suitcases, and stereos. After the hordes desecrated the empty, sterile rooms, they put in the first of many hours
needed for the most popular major on campus, Applied Waiting in Line.

Descriptions about orientation were varied and opinionated. Dana Beach was questioned about the best part of orientation. His answer was
concise and to the point, “The end of it.”

Mr. Grimm, proprietor of the renowned Mooresville Bakery, based his thoughts on freshmen in general. “Freshmen? Well, once they learn
the prices, they’re like everyone else,” he said. “This year they haven’t been quite as rowdy. Used to be they
made so much noise I couldn’t hear myself think. This year I haven’t had to call them down at all.”
Grimm indicated that business just ain’t what it used to be.

Hall counselor Scott Buell thought it was an exciting four days. Further, he assured all concerned that he couldn’t speak

more and then you go across there and on the other side of the white place are four in a
row. Rusk is that way. Hang a right and you can’t miss it.”) And the omnipresent lines were there too.

That night the first local showers took place. They have occurred with alarming regularity ever since. Their most common form
is a great downpour from dorm windows, followed by amusing antics from irate victims.

On Monday the tedium was relieved by points of high mediocrity. These included the first annual coed cake race, supper,
and the Talent (?) Show. It stumbled along with the M.C. doing his worst to add a touch of humor
to the proceedings.

Tuesday was the last day of freedom before classes began. The Field Day and Freshman Regatta highlighted the orientation period.
The freshmen made fools of themselves, their hall counselors made fools of themselves, and even Dean Terry managed to look
foolish.

That night the Activities Fair was held. This was the final chance for the freshmen to sign up for clubs
or organizations before classes started. A wide and interesting variety of things to do and people to see was offered.

On Wednesday, college started with classes beginning at 8 a.m. And though Davidson mice were...
