On Monday the Varsity left on a strenuous four-day trip, playing four of the strongest teams in the state on
consecutive evenings. On Monday, the 14th, A. & M. was played at Raleigh. From there the team journeyed to Durham,
playing Trinity College there on the night of the 15th. The next stop will be Chapel Hill, where North Carolina
will try conclusions with the Red and Black quintet. On Thursday night, the locals will return home. On the 19th,
the team will go to Statesville, where the Statesville Y. M. C. A. will be met in a return game.
This is by far the hardest trip of the season. A. & M., Trinity, North Carolina, and Greensboro form probably
the most formidable quartet of teams to be picked from the state, but Davidson will be ready for the challenge.

EDITORIAL.

WAR KNOWLEDGE.

There has been much comment recently about the ignorance, on the part of college students, of the present war. As
long as the term “ignorance” is confined to the details of battles, and the names of generals, and information of
this kind, we expect that the charge is correct. Not only is the charge true in this war, but we
would go a little deeper, and say that we believe that it is true of most of the wars in
history. In fact, college students seem to care more about effect than they do about cause, and we believe that
this will hold true in this present case. While you will find many men who don’t know the last battle
fought or even who is in command of the French army or any one of dozens of facts of this
kind, which we agree it would possibly be well for them to know, yet we are sure that it is
a very rare occurrence when you will find one who is not interested in knowing the conditions which are arising
because of the war, and more than that, who will not put a good deal of time in studying the
outstanding facts, in trying to prophesy the conditions which we will have after the war is closed. We wonder if
the stress is not being put in the wrong place, and that instead of trying to confine war knowledge to
detailed facts, that more time should be given to that knowledge which will affect us most, say twenty-five years from
now.

WITH OTHER COLLEGES.

Clemson—Mr. Wayne M. Hart, a graduate of Georgetown University, has been selected as head coach of football at Clemson next
year. Mr. Hart graduated at Georgetown in 1912, where he played three years as tackle, having played the year previous
at George Washington University. He was selected as a member of the All-South Atlantic team for the four years that
he played football.

University of West Virginia—A new exchange of The Davidsonian is The Athenaeum, an excellent eight-page weekly of the University of
West Virginia. Messrs. Tobin and McIntyre have been selected as football coaches at West Virginia next year. Tobin was captain
of Pennsylvania State football team during his Senior year, while McIntyre was a star at West Virginia.hopes to come out
of the trip with their victory column substantially increased.

ENTERTAINMENT GIVEN BY CIVIC LEAGUE

A fancy dress party was given Monday night by the Civic League to a large number of town people and
college men. The hall was beautifully decorated with hearts and many of the men and ladies were in costume. There
were games of various kinds played. Order was kept by an able corps of police ladies, who arrested and fined
most promiscuously for talking too much, too little, for smiling, for laughing, for winking, etc. As soon as the judge
had imposed as much as ten cents worth of fines, the prisoner would be sentenced to refreshments of punch and
cake. Among the features of the evening were the instrumental music by F. H. Baker and Townsend, Chief Mullen’s jokes,
and a solo by Miss Reba Brawley, of Mooresville. The party was arranged by a committee of ladies with Mrs.
W. J. Martin as chairman. The money taken in is to be used in the improvement of Main Street and
Concord Avenue.
