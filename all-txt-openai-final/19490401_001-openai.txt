**LOSS OF EXAMINATION RECORDS DISRUPTS SENIORS SCHEDULE**

Because of an unavoidable, but unfortunate mistake by the administration, the class of '49 will leave Davidson slightly later than
usual. The graduation grades for the early part of June have been postponed until July 1-3 in order to give
time for two one-week review periods and a two-week exam period. The slight inconveniences of these re-examinations are the result
of an early morning accident which occurred during the Spring Holidays. Registrar F. W. Hengeveld, shivering from cold in the
early morning hours, gathered up by unhappy chance the entire set of first semester grades to light a roaring fire.
We quote Mr. Hengeveld: "Gee, fellows, I'm sorry but it was a mistake anyone could have made."

In a gesture of extraordinary magnanimity, the administration has decided that the college will charge no extra tuition fees for
the extended school term. Dean Brown feels sure that the faculty will gladly donate their time for the benefit of
the seniors. Consequently, the only expense will be for board. Mr. Spence has undertaken to estimate and tentative plans call
for board at the amazingly low sum of eighty dollars for the month. As a special reward for the extra
trouble to the seniors, the graduate record examination will be administered free of charge to anyone who wishes to remain
another week at the end of the examination period.

**Shakespeare Burned, Masterpieces Secure**

Today, the library received a new shipment of 500 books to replace their collection of Greek philosophy and the entire
set of Shakespeare and religious books, which include "Peter Rabbit," "Mother Goose," "Superman," "Jack and the Beanstalk," "Raggedy Ann and
Andy," and "Little Red Riding Hood." These books are part of the Development Program, Dr. Cunningham said. "The acquisition of
this collection is one of the most peculiar achievements in its entire history. I am sure that they will be
a cultural boon to coming generations."

Dr. Chalmers Davidson, director of the library, stated at a testimonial dinner given to him in gratitude for his outstanding
work in procuring the set, "I am sure that Peter Stuart Ney smiled up at us from the realm of
Pluto when he learned of our good fortune." These books, unfortunately, will not be available to the student body for
some time, because the faculty has reserved these books for their own use. "I can hardly wait to open 'Little
Red Riding Hood,'" he added.

Friday night, the discarded books will be burned in the center of Richardson Field for the student body celebration of
this event. This rally will be climaxed by a reading of "First Reader" by Dean Bailey.

Away with this farce! It’s going to rain as usual!

**Beaty Bows to Hugo; Sapp Elected Mayor**

In a very recent town election, "Hugh" H. Sapp, who operates the College Cut-Rate, received a slim majority of the
votes cast to become Mayor of Davidson, defeating incumbent Mayor A. Beaty for the chief position in the town government.
Official returns indicate that there will be a full bottle of "Peruna" in the medicine cabinet of the new mayor.

Beaty, who will swear in his successor at high noon on April 31, conceded his defeat immediately after the final
count. He disclosed that he had expected his defeat, bemoaning the fact that free milk shakes held more attraction for
the proletariat than Latin primers. In a congratulatory statement to Sapp, the defeated candidate said:

**Guest Speaker April 31**

On April 31, the student body will have the privilege of hearing Mr. Otto Smickleshturnt, better known as "Pretty Boy
Grimes," lecture on the subject "The Art of Distilling the Everyday" in the next series of the Duc show lecture
program. Due to a conflict, the lecture will take place in the basement of Chambers on the same night as
the informative stage show "Craps and Shooting in Peaceful Silence" in the Chapel. A former Shakespearean gunman of the illegitimate
operetta and a notorious horse racing gambler who specializes in the rare art of procuring money from "Cash" Jackson will
also be present.

**ARTISTS SPREAD NAME OF COLLEGE**

The Davidson College Concert Band has just returned from one of its most successful concert tours. Its route took this
talented group of musicians throughout the length and breadth of several of our most music-loving Southern States. They traveled by
bus to Citrus Corner, Florida (by way of Hootin' Hollow, South Carolina) where they played to a packed barn for
two successive nights. The appreciative esthetes crowded close around the platform and lent their wholehearted support to the musicians with
a rhythmic, though somewhat irregular, stomping of their feet. On the second evening's performance, the band was particularly indebted for
the basso profundo choral refrain that was intermittently rendered by the trio of Jersey cows in the second stall.

The most exciting incident of the trip occurred at Corn Pone Junction, a town claimed by neither Georgia nor Florida,
where the above picture was taken. As the assembled artists were playing with their usual gusto, the bandmaster,

**Student Body Traits Revealed In Tests**

Professor Oswald of the Psychology Department today announced the results of the Vocational Guidance Tests recently given to a part
of the junior and senior classes. The report was not specific in nature but gave what are probably the general
trends of one student body, as represented by the group who took the tests.

Primarily, the group showed a remarkably high rating in the social division of the test. This result is substantiated by
the excellent attendance at social gatherings such as chapel and vespers. It is pointed out that the fellowship involved in
these gatherings further strengthens one’s social tendencies and Professor Oswald urges those who do not feel inclined to attend to
reconsider. Failure to do so would mean declining an excellent opportunity that many schools do not offer.

Another characteristic of the student body as indicated by the tests is a sincere desire to obtain additional knowledge of
any nature. This, too, can best be illustrated by

**Eza Abdicates; Hiei New President**

The student body will vote on one of the following groups: YMCA Articles, Spiked Jones and his Stewed Prunes, or
Billy Knauff's All-E-Wife.

In a recent coup d'etat under the leadership of Field Marshal Von Johnsonsky, commanding the Davidsongrad ROTC, Shick Evansogorksy was
made dictator of the Movement for Complete Alcoholism. The seizure of power was carried out in a quiet manner with
the dynamiting of the west wing of Chambers and Hugo's. The only thing that threw a pall over the triumph
was the death of the first five names on the Fuehrer’s death list, who were disposed of by planting on
them funds from the Davidson Development Drive and turning them over to the authorities.

Yesterday, the first five-year plan was issued. The only thing that might be the president of the student body is
the funds from the Davidson Development Drive, and turning them over to the authorities.to Drs. Cunningheimer and Arnold:

Orchestra for Homecoming; the president of the Pan Hel. After attending the execution, I returned to my headquarters to appoint
a cabinet.

Davidson College Concert Orchestra concluded its itinerary of the Southland. The list of men to fill key positions in the
government was released. Secretary of Girl's Schools, our own beloved James Heathen; Secretary of Freshman Persecution, Charlie Mitchell; Secretary of
Girl's Sea Scout Work, Abdul Bailey; Secretary of Publications, J.D. Ashmore; Secretary of Spirit Development, Henry Wilson; Secretary of Curb
Services, John McNair.

By BILL HOLLISTER

The administration has announced that the biggest triple-step drive in Mecklenburg County is almost ready for operation. Secretary Henry Wilson
also stated that the HOO under Georgia was soon to be converted into a modern 20-shots-per-minute bar. There is a
rumor that Set Bowles will manage this establishment, but Wilson quieted this by stating that it was to run on
the honor system. (You're on your honor not to bring any bats or purple elephants into the bar.)

Room-to-room delivery of the Squire and the establishment of a Caldwell Memorial Library are the immediate objectives of the Publications
Department, according to a memorandum from the desk of Secretary Ashmore.

Applications have been received from prospective female students. These new coeducational regulations, from which the following excerpt is taken, state
that girls must be accompanied on dates A.D. (after dusk) by Miss Ashmore and four members of the Board of
Trustees. They must sign in no later than 10:00 p.m. and say goodnight to their escorts by a handshake not
to exceed 15 seconds.

Interruptions by “Mouse” Morgan, Randy Ensign, “Sandy” Carnegie, and Bill Scruggs with appropriate background music made up the world premiere
showing of the “Maxine Erwin Shows.” This program, composed of some of the best burlesque talent in the business, will
hit the road in a few days. The Boston appearance has been canceled since the censors cut so much from
the act that it would only last fifteen minutes. However, the show will appear at the leading burlesque theaters in
New York, Chicago, Lower Slobbovia, and Timbuktu.

As the curtain dropped last night after the fiftieth encore, dramatic critics from the A.P., U.P., I.N.S., S.H., Herald-Tribune, New
York Times, and Cornelius Dispatch rushed to Hugo's to wire in copy. Here’s what they said:

“Sensational, completely revealing. A must for all anatomy students.”—A.P.
“A stupendous display of talented strip tease artists.”—U.P.
“Gypsy Rose Lee, look out.”—I.N.S.
“Should be entitled, ‘The Show That Startled Kinsey.’”—Scripps-Howard.
“The addition of the ‘more deadly of the species’ to our new-look campus naturally necessitates a few changes. For example,
good grades will be more difficult to obtain for this reason. Girls have a way of attracting attention and of
occupying one’s mind with thoughts other than those pertaining directly to square roots, formulas, and universe proportions. Professors have also
blushingly admitted that they will no longer be able to maintain the same level of academic rigor.”

An effort to enforce the right-hand rule of the road throughout the world has failed. The influence for the left
couldn’t be overcome.

Jesse Jones thinks that if necessary, the government will simply subsidize everyone. That seemed to have been the plan under
the New Deal.

PLANS CHANGED; BAND CALLED TO HOLLYWOOD TO MAKE MOVIE

Tex Beneke wired yesterday that the band couldn't make it down for the Frolics because last night he won $390,624
and decided he had enough to retire. Tex said he regretted to disrupt plans for the dance but promised to
send 16,000 feet of film.
