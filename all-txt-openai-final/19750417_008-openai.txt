The Davidson track team tied two school records and came close to several others in meets held here this past week. The Wildcats finished fifth in a 17-team field Saturday in the 16th Annual Davidson Relays.

Western Carolina won three relays in scoring 89 points to edge defending champion West Georgia’s 84 total. Following them were Berry with 74, Appalachian with 73, and Davidson with 66. Among other teams participating were High Point, Campbell, Catawba, Wake Forest, Cumberland, Georgia State, Wofford, and Gardner-Webb.

Records were broken in the discus, javelin, triple jump, six-mile, and high hurdles. Two records were set in new events, the steeplechase and hammer.

Davidson scored 50 of its points in six of the 12 individual events. They added 16 points by placing in 3 of the seven relays.

Greg Love tied the school record in the 120-yard high hurdles, running a 14.2 in the finals to take second place. He also anchored the 480-yard shuttle hurdle relay to a second-place finish.

That team included Bob Trumbo and freshmen Gary Danciger and Dick Boehner.

Boehner also ran on the mile and two-mile relay teams, both of which won their heat and placed fourth overall.

The mile relay team clocked 3:22.6 to tie the school record set in 1969. Senior captain Mark Connors ran a 48.5 anchor, following legs by Steve Justus, this reporter, and Boehner.

Seniors Buck Farrow, Bob Lautensack, and Ricky Bell teamed with Boehner to run 8:07 in the two-mile relay.

Earlier in the day, Lautensack and Farrow placed fourth and fifth in the steeplechase. Diving fans were disappointed when ‘Bozo’ Bill Cole switched from the steeplechase to the six-mile, in which sophomore Coty Pinckney headlighted his way to sixth place.

All three of Davidson’s high jumpers cleared 6’4” to take three places in that event.

John Stanfield tied for second on fewer misses, with Steve Trusgnich finishing in a tie for fourth and Eppa Rixey placing sixth.

Jeff Diller and freshman Jerry Taylor took second and fourth in the hammer, giving Davidson 12 points there.

The Wildcats also took second and fourth in the pole vault, with Woody ‘220’ Van Meter and John Lewis jumping.

Van Meter made his annual appearance in the 880 relay, in which his past performances have led others to ask: ‘Does that guy really run track?’

The Keydets of VMI invaded Richardson Field Monday afternoon, using strategically placed elbows to fight their way to a 98-65 triumph.

VMI swept the intermediate hurdles and long and triple jumps to build a 36-0 advantage which the Cats could not overcome.

Connors once again had an exceptional day, winning the 100 and 220 and running a personal best 48.4 anchor split in the mile relay for a come-from-behind victory there.

His 22.1 in the 220 is nearing the school record of 21.3 set seven years ago, and he should challenge the open 440 record of 48.7 set in 1962.

Pinckney ran a 15:09.5 to take second place in the three-mile, and his time is within three seconds of Coach Sterling Martin’s record.

Van Meter cleared 14’ in the pole vault, while Allen Schaberg won the discus for the fourth time this year with a heave of 133’10”.

Freshmen Justus and Boehner ran their best times of the year, with Justus winning the 440 in 51.6 and Boehner running a gutty 1:57.8 to take second in the 880.

Diller grabbed second in both the shot and hammer, while Love won the highs in 14.6.

Davidson swept the high jump, with Stanfield and Trusgnich again clearing 6’4” to tie for first. Stanfield cleared 6’6” after the competition was over, which is higher than the 6’5¾” jump record by Rixey who finished third.

The track team travels to The Citadel for a meet Saturday to close out the regular season. A win there would leave them 4-4 for the year.
