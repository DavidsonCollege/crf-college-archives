### Short Story

**Make Do by Sarah Zirkle**

I used to feel sorry for myself ‘cause I didn’t have nobody, nobody ‘cept my own. I’s a loner, on
loan to other people. My job’s changed, but I still get rented out. I work for the Vanderlands, well really
I work for “Home Maid,” ‘cause that’s what I am, a maid for some other folk’s home. That’s what I’s
made for I guess. I ain’t no home-maker. Ain’t got no house. My home’s where I make it. Where I
get by, but Lord, sometimes it’s hard to come clean.

I ain’t never met the Vanderlands, but they hired me just the same, past and all. I passed o.k. for
them. Anyhows, the company must’ve told ‘em. They say they’s “obligated to pass on such information.” Well, I reckon everybody’s
beholden to somebody or another. I ain’t holding to nothing ‘cept my papers say I’m o.k. Them’s what I hold
to, they’s my pass so’s I can work.

Lotta folks say a home’s what I need. I oughta be in a home they say, ‘cause they wouldn’t want
me near theirs. They passed me up. But that don’t make no nevermind, that ain’t what I come to pass
on. I take a bus from the center all the way ‘cross town. It'd take days to walk. They say
I can’t take that much time. I ain’t ever taken nothing that warn’t mine, but times change. Now that I
done mine, it’s all I got left. I got left by my maw. She run out, but time don’t.

I know I’s there when I see them big gates with them bars all cold and shiny-like, reach’n right up
to the sky. I seen a lotta bars in my time. I used to work at one, but what I
done was dirty, so they say. I didn’t know no better—no better time, no better place. I done told you
I ain’t got no place, never did. My home’s where I made it. If I didn’t make it, I didn’t
have no home. I knowed that. My mama knowed it, too. I wouldn’t be here. But I’s there when I
see that gate, and that long drive snaking up to the house they call Paradise. It was built long ‘fore
there’s anything else here, so I’s told. I walk through the garden on the path, but I can’t go in
directly like I’s in the family. I ain’t got none. (I go in back.)

I don’t know my father, but I been look’n long as I can remember. I don’t know what I’d say
to him if’n I saw his face to face. I s’pose I’d ask him why he made it so’s I’s
here. But I ain’t found him yet. I don’t even know why I look ‘cept something inside says he’d take
me in his home no matter what dirt he had on me. He’d take me in ‘cause I’s his child
an’ I been wanderin’ all my life lookin’ for him. (Well it ain’t like I got much else to do
‘cept clean up.) I ain’t alone in this huge house, there’s the cook and the gardener.

### ARC Working to Move Into Charlotte

**Coalition Aims to Provide City With Alternative Station**

By Allison Wright

Does classical music leave you cold? Do you find Bon Jovi’s “Bed of Roses” to be anything but? Do you
have a sudden urge to break an inanimate object if you hear Billy Ray Cyrus’ “Achy Breaky Heart” one more
time? Or does Madonna’s latest hit, “Erotica,” fail to turn you on?

If you are looking for a radio station with something different - be it punk, funk, grunge, blues, world music,
folk, or reggae - you have something in common with the Alternative Radio Coalition (ARC). Rachel Stewart, head of ARC’s
music/operations committee and graduate of Davidson’s class of ‘86, describes ARC as a “grassroots community volunteer organization dedicated to bringing
alternative music to Charlotte and educating people about...the opportunities and the need for it.” The Alternative Radio Coalition was started
about a year ago by people who share an interest in music and who felt that people in the music
community were not being represented on the air. They plan on doing something about it. One of the ARC’s primary
goals is to bring WNCW (88.7FM) to Charlotte. WNCW is an alternative radio station based in Spindale, N.C. and is
affiliated with Isothermal Community College. To do this, the ARC needs $15,000 to finance a translator—the transmitter needed to pick
up and rebroadcast WNCW’s original signal at another frequency in Charlotte.

Through public donations and fundraising events such as “ARC DJ Night” (to be held February 27, 8 p.m., at the
Park Elevator in Charlotte), the coalition hopes to have the necessary funds within the year. In addition to raising money
to purchase a translator, the ARC is looking for aspiring disc jockeys who would be willing to work an overnight
show at WNCW in Spindale. Stewart says that the station is not looking for a hyped-up, gimmicky, traditional DJ type.
They want the average person with a genuine interest in music—someone open-minded who is willing to explore musically. Those who
are interested, have questions, or just want to show support for the Alternative Radio Coalition, can call the ARC phone
line—565-5093—anytime.

Phish's fourth album, Rift, came out last week.

Fourth Phish Release: Expect the Unexpected
By Chris Hoveland

Last week Phish released their fourth album, Rift, their second effort for Elektra. Rift features all the surprises that have
come to be expected from this New England band: weird lyrics, far-out chord progressions, and a synthesis of styles which
can only be Phish. This album demonstrates that the band has delved further into themselves and have not “sold out”
despite their ever-increasing popularity.

Anyone who was fortunate enough to catch Phish at Davidson, and who has an incredible aural memory, will recognize several
songs from last year’s performance: “Sparkle” (“... laughing, laughing, fall apart”), as well as “Horn” and “It’s Ice.” The studio
versions have lost nothing of the live energy heard at that performance. Another item to note is the recording difference
in this album compared with A Picture of Nectar. Although I don’t see any indication on the cover or liner
notes, I think this album was mixed on analogue tape (as is Bela Fleck’s latest album) which gives a much
warmer overall sound quality. Also, the band overdubs quite a bit more on Rift than on previous albums.

The album opens with the bluish-grass title track, which features the foot tap-inducing rhythm section and a very catchy melody.
This song will probably be the most frequently heard track on campus. “Fast Enough for You” will throw you for
a loop—it’s a country western song, pedal steel and all. The same goes for “Maze” which has a Police-ish bass
line and a thrashy chorus, and also “Mound” which is simultaneously a blues, reggae, and blue-grass ditty. I can’t say
they’re particularly good songs, though. I admire the band for stretching their sound, but the last two songs mentioned seem
somewhat forced.

Most noteworthy of the new tracks include “It’s Ice” which is simply an incredibly well-written and indescribable song (the text
isn’t even nonsensical); the funk/jazz “Weigh,” the words of which are humorously ridiculous; “The Wedge” which I suppose could be
described as a Dead song with a Latin swing beat; and “All Things Reconsidered” which is an instrumental composition reminiscent
of Anastasio’s “Magilla” on Picture. Rift, while perhaps not as strong as A Picture of Nectar in terms of consistently
solid songs, indicates the direction the band is taking. They are obviously not selling out despite their growing popularity.
