The third-ranked Davidson Wildcats saw their nation-leading 18-game win streak come to an end in sweltering heat on Saturday, when the No. 8 Jacksonville Dolphins trounced them 45-3.

Junior quarterback Paul Nichols had his worst game as a Davidson starter on Saturday, completing just 12 of 32 passes for 86 yards and throwing a career-high five interceptions. The Wildcats’ last loss came on September 25, 1999, to Emory & Henry.

An impressive group of Davidson supporters, including many parents and college president Bobby Vagt, made the trip to Florida as Davidson hoped to tie the fifth-longest winning streak in Division I-AA history.

The game, hyped in the Jacksonville papers because of Davidson’s record, began on an ominous note when Dolphin defensive man Jeremy Kearson intercepted a Nichols pass midway through the first quarter and returned the pick for an 81-yard touchdown.

After Dolphin Linj Shell took Nichols’ second interception in for six, Nichols was intercepted yet again, this time by Dolphin Matt Marshall, who also returned the pick for a touchdown. Marshall’s interception put the Dolphins up 21-0, equaling the total number of points allowed by the ‘Cats in the first quarter all last season. The three interceptions along with two rushing touchdowns accounted for the Dolphins’ 35 unanswered points in the first half—all but sealing a Jacksonville victory. The Wildcats’ lone score came in the opening drive of the second half as kicker Daniel Hanks capped off a 57-yard drive with a 35-yard field goal. The 35-point half posted by the Dolphins proved too much to overcome as the ‘Cats suffered their worst defeat in three years.

A 73-yard touchdown drive and kicker Chris Brown’s 31-yard field goal cemented Jacksonville’s win before the scoreless fourth quarter. Jacksonville has handed Davidson three of its six losses since 1998. Despite Saturday’s resounding defeat, the ‘Cats remain optimistic. Freshman running back John Leverett said, “We can’t act like the season is over. We just have to start at the beginning and regroup.”

The Wildcats will indeed look to regroup this weekend as they host Drake in Saturday’s Homecoming game. Kickoff is set for 1 p.m. in Richardson Stadium.

I walked into my hall lounge Saturday night to check the score of the Tennessee/Arkansas game, and it was there I first found out that Jacksonville ended our football streak. I heard the bad tidings from a girl watching a tennis game and doing Spanish homework. She hadn’t heard the news from a player; she’d bothered to listen to the game live via the internet.

I was naturally shocked to hear the news of the football team’s first loss in 19 games. My surprise soon fell, however, to an impressed awe of our school’s devotion. At 10 p.m. on a Saturday night, I saw a girl doing Spanish homework because she spent part of her day listening to our football game taking place in Jacksonville, Fla. Enthusiasm for something on this campus beyond books or beer? I'll be kerschnickered.

School spirit manifests itself in a myriad of ways at Davidson, and more often than not the fan support is felt and not seen. Saturday night I wondered how great it must feel to walk on a football field two states away and know that perfect strangers at my school support me at that very minute. Naturally, the physical presence of fans lights the proverbial fire under the ass, but win or lose Davidson athletes boast support.

We’re a competitive breed here in our little bubble; about one-fourth of our student body participates on the varsity level, and 90 percent of the leftovers play club or intramural sports. Somewhere between academia and athletics we find time to live and support friends in their endeavors.

I am entreating the students at this school to remain stoic and supportive in the face of adversity. At few other times in your life will you need support from friends and fans. I urge y’all to carry this sense of camaraderie to the field and the stands—even if Spanish homework needs to be done.
