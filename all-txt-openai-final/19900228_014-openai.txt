**On the importance of words and womankind**

Lucia Kendall

If someone told you, “you're very special!” would your response be the same as if someone told you “you're very
peculiar!”? The definition of the word “special” and the word “peculiar” are the same: they are both defined as “different.”
But one word connotes a warm-fuzzy, Hallmark-card-ish, honey-glazed differentness and the other connotes a hey-how-come-you’re-eating-your-lima-beans-with-peanut-butter differentness. The two words have
the same definition but they have different meanings. In fact, all words have more meaning than their definitions state.

Many of us think that as long as we know the correct definitions of the words we use, their meaning
doesn’t matter. But meaning is very, well, meaningful. Because words have more meaning than their definitions state, it makes no
sense to argue that since Webster's Dictionary defines the word “man” as “humanity,” the word has no meaning beyond that.
Even though the definition of the word includes both genders, the meaning concentrates on one gender. If you were asked
to think of an immediate mental image of “man,” would there be any females in your mental picture? The solution
to this problem, of course, is that if you mean “humanity” you should say “humanity,” not “man.”

In addition, meaning is different from intent. “I never meant to hurt you” is a famous line for the end
of relationships. The problem with this line is that even though the intent to hurt wasn’t there, the meaning of
the accidental hurt certainly is--anyone who has ever heard these words while trying to bandage a heart that has been
sliced, diced, and mutilated by the machete of a well-intentioned lover can testify to this fact. In addition, because meaning
is often different from intent, if you intend to include both genders, it is necessary to say “humanity” instead of
“man.” Your listeners will not hear your good intentions unless these intentions are conveyed by your words.

Since we think in words as well as communicate in words, words have the power not only to reflect our
attitudes but to shape them. This tendency is often used in politics: for example, if Bush labels the Nicaraguan Sandinistas
as “Marxist” we automatically assume that the Sandinistas are evil and repressive. Our attitude has been formed based on a
word for which we have established no precise meaning: we do not ask, for example, which of Marx’s ideas they
accept (and anyone who has studied Marx knows that he had many good and useful ideas) or whether Bush is
applying the label “Marxist” to anyone left of Jesse Helms. As another example of the manipulation of meaning, consider the
use of “doublespeak” in George Orwell’s 1984. If we think in terms of words impacting our attitudes, it becomes obvious
that their full meanings are significant.

There are many people who think of sexism as a problem only when qualified women are denied jobs on the
basis of their gender. A view this limited, however, does not acknowledge the importance of attitudes that discourage women from
reaching their full potential. One of the ways these attitudes are perpetuated, often with no malicious intent, is by affirming
men’s importance while neglecting to affirm women’s. Because words influence our attitudes, language is one of the many ways in
which we assert the value of men while ignoring the value of women. When we're speaking or writing of people
who fill a role in a general sense, such as “the reader” or “the scientist” or “the individual investor,” why
do we always refer to these people as “he?” Aren't the women who read and the women who study science
and the women who invest as worthy of mention as their male counterparts? What about making grandiose proclamations concerning, for
example, the evolution of man?females didn’t get left behind in the Neanderthal age, did they? Don’t both of these usages
affirm men’s importance while neglecting to affirm women’s? But, you may argue, women should just understand that they’re included in
the term “he” and the term “man.” But here is an essential question: don’t you think women are entitled to
their own identity that is not included in, or a part of, or under the category of, or within the
definition of, men’s? Why should one half of the population be spoken of as if they were a subset of
rather than an equivalent of the other half? But, you may sputter incredulously, we use the term “he” because it’s
TRADITION. But, I respond with a smile of perfect equanimity, tradition has been determined by PATRIARCHY. (Patriarchy, for those of
you who have avoided women who speak in capital letters, means society’s institutionalization of sexism; patriarchy is to feminism what
McDonald’s ‘is’ to cows.) Just because tradition has, to a large extent, ignored women in the past does not mean
we should allow it to do so in the present or the future. There are numerous ways for us to
affirm women’s importance. Although language is certainly not the only one, it is a useful and important one. Each of
us can listen for gender-exclusive language and make a conscious effort to avoid it in our own usage. To try
to balance the uses of language that neglect women, the next time you write a paper in which you talk
about “the reader,” “the scientist” or “the individual investor,” try referring to this person as “she” instead of “he.” You
may want to add a footnote at the bottom of the page explaining that men should understand that they’re included
in the term “she.” If it feels funny at first, remember that people felt funny about women getting the right
to vote, too. You can handle it.

Working out, semi Puckett style

The Davidsonian’s roving reporters visited Davidson’s weight room and could not help but notice two Davidson females obviously exercising very
strenuously, as evidenced by the light dew of sweat on their foreheads. Curiosity prompted us to inquire into the health
regimen which produced their fine physiques. Since they didn’t want every male on campus beating down their doors, they asked
to remain anonymous.

Davidsonian: How often do you engage in such rigorous activity?
Female #1: Before date functions and Spring Break.
Female #2: I find that the commercial breaks during my soap operas provide ample opportunity for an intense workout.

Davidsonian: For Davidson women, you’re obviously in peak condition. What workouts do you recommend?
Female #1: Patterson Court is a highly recommended place to burn those extra calories. My personal favorites include cup-stacking, scromping,
and keg-tapping.
Female #2: We also hope to work up to the point where we can operate all these complex machines in
the weight room properly.

Davidsonian: And what eating habits do you use to supplement this exercise routine?
Female #1: I like to alternate between eating and non-eating days. For example, today I dined on a box of
Krispy Kreme doughnuts for breakfast and then I visited the Rusk eating trough where I enjoyed a pan of fried
cheese sticks and three bowls of ice cream. But tomorrow’s diet will consist of three leaves of lettuce, a glass
of water, and Acutrim.
Female #2: I'll admit that yesterday I partook of a McDonald's Big Mac, fries, and a chocolate shake. But I
negated all that with a Diet Coke.

Davidsonian: So what is your aspiration for your workout here this afternoon?
Female #1: Well actually (giggle, giggle) we’re hoping to get a glimpse of Mark in all his Spandex glory.
Female #2: And so The Davidsonian reporters left this scene, inspired by a new vision of fitness and good health.

Kim Munsterman, Virginia Mischen, and Stacy Rooker are all sophomores and write for the features section for The Davidsonian.

Hey, Don't Throw This Paper Away. RECYCLE!
