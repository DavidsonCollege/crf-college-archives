Foxx, Smith Tabbed
to Lead Student Body

By Phelps Sprinkle
Last Tuesday the category one
elections were held and seven new
positions were filled. The results
are: Anthony Foxx--SGA Presi-
dent; Alden Smith--SGA Vice-
President; Ann Todd--Union Presi-
dent; Kristen Stricker--Union Vice-
President (co-curricular); Meg
Jones--Union Vice-President
(social); Deidre Montague and
Tom Price--Student Solicitors;
Arthur Morehead and David Lind-
say--Defense Advisors.

Anthony Foxx was optimistic,
yet apprehensive about his new
role as SGA President. Foxx takes
office at a time when tensions over
several issues are high. “I’m kind
of nervous about it, to tell you the
truth, because no one knows what
to expect,” Foxx told the Charlotte
Observer last Wednesday. “This
could be a very exciting and fulfill-
ing time for the college. But it
could be a frustrating time, too.”

Foxx is the first black SGA
President to be elected at Davidson.
After a semester marred with ra-
cial and sexual tension, Foxx’s
election is particularly significant.
When asked about the importance
of his election, Foxx said, “I’ve
been black all my life, but being
President is new for me. I believe
that I can provide some unique
insight, particularly on this new
issue of intolerance.”

Foxx also stressed the impor-
tance of unity among various
campus organizations. “I want the
SGA to be grass-roots, where the
students feel that they have some
say about what is going on. The
immediate challenge for me right
now is to find my place between
the students, faculty, and trustees.”

College Relations to
Publish Wildcat Handbook

By May Martin
Look for the class of 1996 to
approach freshman orientation
well-prepared for the trials of
Davidson and for their new class-
mates by their Wildcat Handbooks.
Last semester, freshmen waited
until early November to receive
their handbooks. Many felt that
the delay in production weakened
the books’ purpose. The hand-
books are useful to freshmen at the
beginning of the semester because
they contain general information
and more importantly, the names,
pictures, and hometowns of the
entire class.

To ensure prompt production
and publication next fall, the hand-
book will be produced with the
help of College Relations. Direc-
tor of College Relations, Jerry
Stockdale, says that by working
with a staff member, the student
editors will be able to concentrate
on making a quality publication.
College Relations will supervise
the mechanical production and
printing.

In the past, handbook editors
Lori Rockett, class of 1991, and
senior Andrea Bond, used College
Relations as a resource for produc-
tion. Last year’s editors did not
work as closely with College Rela-
tions, and this, Stockdale says, may
have been a factor in the delay.
If you are interested in editing
the handbook, sign up in the Dean
of Students Office. Sign ups end
February 19 at 1 pm.
