Hansell’s goal late in the second half is all Wildcats need in 1-0 victory

The third-seeded Davidson men’s soccer team shut out Georgia Southern, 1-0, in the first round of the Southern Conference Championship
Tournament on Friday night. Senior goalkeeper Soren Johnson made some key saves throughout the match, and in doing so he
tied two school records. Johnson picked up his seventh shutout of the season, matching Davidson’s single-season record set by former
All-American Jim Kelly in 1987. Johnson’s 20 career shutouts also tie him with Alex Deegan (1991-95), who was instrumental in
Davidson’s run to the national semifinals in 1992.

The ‘Cats had a few scoring opportunities in the opening half, but the best came with about 18 minutes before
the first whistle. Sophomore Dan Ferriter managed to shoot the ball off of a well-placed cross by senior Joe Sadler
from the near side of the field. Ferriter’s shot was seemingly on target for the back of the net, but
Georgia Southern’s keeper made a diving save to keep the game scoreless as the teams headed into the locker rooms.

Returning from halftime, the Eagles controlled the game, producing several scoring opportunities. Southern managed to set up a two-on-one play
at the 36:20 mark to create a great chance, but the shot sailed over the net. Only a few minutes
later, Johnson had to make a diving save to keep the game scoreless and preserve his shutout.

Although the Eagles had been getting the majority of the scoring opportunities in the second half, the Wildcats scored what
proved to be the game-winner with less than 10 minutes left in regulation. Freshman defender Nahum Navas took the ball
down the near side into the corner of the Eagles’ defensive box and gave it up to junior Nick Hansell.
Hansell seized the opportunity and shot the ball past Southern’s goalkeeper for the only score of the game.

“The game could have gone either way,” said Davidson head coach Matt Spear. “Georgia Southern played very strong soccer, and
I’m not surprised it was a close game. Hansell stepped up for us offensively when we needed it while Johnson
was big-time for us in goal.”

The Eagles were unable to match Hansell’s goal, and the Wildcat defense stood strong as the game ended in a
1-0 Davidson victory. With the win, the ‘Cats were headed for the second round of the championships to play seventh-seeded
VMI. The Wildcats had won this season’s match 4-0 against VMI and were coming off their first-round win with confidence.
All their work did not matter in the end, though, as the tournament was canceled during warm-ups due to dangerous
field conditions. Top-seeded Furman automatically received the NCAA tournament bid.

Becken leads men’s cross country team to 17th place at regionals

The last time the men’s cross-country team visited Lake Kristi for a meet, it proved to be the breakout event
for many of the runners and the team as a whole. This time was not much different. Despite light rain
continuing throughout the day, leaving the course wet and sloppy, the ‘Cats raced to one of the best 10k performances
in school history. Senior Brad Becken led the team, finishing 91st in the race that precedes the NCAAs, with a
personal best time of 32:44. His time earned him a spot on the Davidson Top 10 All-Time 10k Performer List.
Junior Chris Schmader (32:59) and freshman Austin Mercadante (33:05) were not far off Becken’s pace. Junior Greg Scott (33:36) and
freshman Jonathan Baker (33:54) both finished in good time, making this the first squad in Coach Andrew’s seventeen-year coaching career
at Davidson to finish every runner in under thirty-four minutes in a 10k race.

“It was a great race for the guys to finish their season on,” Coach Andrew said. “They went out and
fought and came away with something to take into the track season.”

The last time the team ran at Lake Kristi was nearly a month ago, when the Wildcats placed second out
of seven competing Division One schools. This weekend, the ‘Cats...competed against some of the best in the nation, finishing 17th
out of 25 teams, not including the 12 schools that failed to enter the minimum five runners. N.C. State took
the team trophy, while the individual title went to Clemson’s Jason Meany, who blazed by the finish line in 29:50.
N.C. State and William & Mary, the second-place finisher, both earned spots at NCAAs, as will a number of individuals.

Swimming falls to UNCW

Press RELEASE
Sports Information

Both the men’s and women’s swimming and diving teams fell to UNC Wilmington in their first conference meet of the
season. Wilmington won the men’s competition, 149-113. With the loss, Davidson falls to 1-3 overall, 0-1 in the CAA. On
the women’s side, the Seahawks defeated the Wildcats 181.5-118.5. The Wildcat women stand at 2-3 on the season and 0-1
in conference action.

The Wildcats women were paced by dual event winner, freshman Megan Hollar. Hollar was the only Wildcat to win multiple
events, taking the 100 breaststroke in a time of 1:06.17 and the 200 breast in 2:24.63. Junior Jenny Bruggers had
a solid day on the springboard, grabbing two second-place finishes, 1-meter (206.10) and 3-meter (171.37) dives. A pair of sophomores
placed in two events on the day. Jenny Hoekstra, second in the 100 free (54.94) and third in the 50
free (25.79), and Jamie Sassanfar nabbed a pair of second-place finishes in the 50 free (25.19) and the 200 free
(1:41.67). Juniors Kelsey Holmberg, Sarah Laws, and Vanessa Witt placed in two or more events in the meet. Witt was
the only ‘Cat to place in three events on Saturday. She won the 200 fly in 2:10.39, placed second in
the 200 breast with a time of 2:29.83, and grabbed a third-place finish in the 100 fly touching the wall
in a time of 1:00.88. Holmberg finished second in the 1000 free (10:45.83) and third in the 500 free (5:18.8),
while Laws tagged the wall second in the 200 backstroke (2:09.7) and third in the 400 IM (4:43.06).

On the men’s side, the Wildcats took home four second-place finishes and one third place. The Wildcats were led by
sophomore Michael Flowers, who finished second in both the 500 free and 1000 free. He swam a 4:57.52 and 10:20.40
respectively. Classmate Chris Wrobleski nabbed the runner-up spot in the 1-meter dive and third place in the 3-meter dive. Freshman
Steve Tolson’s time of 22.42 was good enough for a second-place finish in the 50 free.

Both swimming teams will be back in action when they host conference foe, Towson, on Dec. 7. The meet will
take place at Cannon Pool and will begin at 1 p.m.

The squad, resting several of its injured runners for track season, ran its last race of the fall as if
it had something to prove. After a disappointing conference finish, the runners put the past behind them, and many nearly
ran to 8k bests on the way to their 10k time. After a short, well-deserved time off, there will be
no prolonged off-season for these athletes.

Indoor track emerges as a prelude to the outdoor season, and the men’s cross-country team will become the distance squad
of track and field. Until then, look out your window on a Sunday afternoon, and you may just catch them
in training, on a 12-mile run, making their legs that much stronger for another grueling and exciting season of track
and field.
