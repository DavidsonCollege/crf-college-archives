#### Late-game mistakes haunt Wildcats against Western
**North Division lead drops to one game after loss**

By Matt Garfield, Managing Editor

A team that seemed to have all the answers when they mattered most finally ran out on Saturday night. The Wildcats fell 73-70 to Western Carolina in overtime, suffering their first loss in eight games this season decided by less than five points. The loss snapped a six-game winning streak that vaulted Davidson (13-6, 6-2) into a two-game lead in first place in the North Division. Now, the team is one game ahead of the Catamounts (11-8, 5-3) and UNC-Greensboro (11-8, 5-3).

The Wildcats took the floor of Belk Arena Saturday in front of a season-high crowd of 3,784, but without senior starters Martin Ides, who suffered a sprained ankle three days before at Greensboro, and Emeka Erege, who missed his fifth game with a lower leg injury. Playing shorthanded is nothing new for a Davidson team that has had a full roster in only four games this season. Even with their center and power forward on the bench, the team appeared to be headed toward a seventh straight win for the first 37 minutes of Saturday’s game.

But the last three minutes of regulation and the ensuing five minutes of overtime featured a frantic and unprecedented role reversal in the type of game that, this season, Davidson has always found a way to win. On this night, though, Western Carolina made the big plays while the Wildcats committed crucial errors.

“I still don’t know how we won that game,” Western Carolina head coach Steve Shurina said after earning his first victory over his former boss.

Down by six with 3:28 left in regulation, Catamounts point guard Casey Rogers hit back-to-back pull-up three-pointers to even the score at 58. All of a sudden, a game that seemed to be well in hand was tied. The Wildcats struggled to keep their composure. Peter Anderer hit a three-pointer of his own to reclaim the lead at 61-58. Cory Largent’s put-back pulled Western Carolina to within one on the ensuing possession, but Wayne Bernard hit two free throws to push the lead back to three with 11 seconds left.

Those seconds would turn out to be Davidson’s worst of the season. After a time-out, Rogers received the inbounds pass and pushed the ball up court to set up a final shot. Davidson coach Bob McKillop had instructed his team during the time-out to foul after the entry pass, forcing the Catamounts to inbound the ball again with only two or three seconds remaining. But it never happened. Bernard left freshman Kevin Martin, the conference’s second leading scorer at 21.7 points per game, to double team Rogers and go for the steal. No foul was committed, and Rogers found Martin open at the top of the key. With 2.4 seconds left, the freshman knocked in a three-pointer to tie the game.

“We were supposed to be man [defense] on that last possession,” said Bob McKillop. “We were supposed to foul before they crossed half court.”

Twenty-one seconds into the overtime period, Martin hit another three-pointer, and Western Carolina never looked back. Davidson had two chances to win or tie the game in the final seconds of overtime, but both attempts fell short.

**Davidson vs. Appalachian State**
**Seby Jones Arena, Boone**
**Saturday, 3 p.m.**

**THE TEAMS:** Davidson (13-6, 6-2) will travel to Boone seeking revenge for two straight losses to the Mountaineers (8-12, 3-6). Saturday’s loss to Western Carolina snapped a six-game Davidson winning streak, but the team is still in first place in the North Division with a one-game lead over UNCG and WCU. Appalachian State is riding an impressive two-game winning streak, with a 78-74 victory at The Citadel Saturday and a 66-62 triumph over WCU on Monday. The Mountaineers are one game behind ETSU in fifth place. Donald Payne, Josh Shehan, and Jonathan Butler lead the team at nine points per game.

**QUOTABLE:** Western Carolina coach Steve Shurina said after his team’s loss that the Mountaineers are a different team than earlier in the season. “The biggest thing is that they're playing with confidence now,” he said. “I knew when that started to happen, they were going to be a very dangerous team. We didn't have the edge tonight. They were more aggressive than us and got to the free-throw line more than us. They wanted it more. They were hungrier.”

**LAST SEASON:** Appalachian St. won both games against Davidson, by scores of 78-68 in Belk Arena and 78-70 in Boone.tie, but both attempts were off the mark. For the first time this season, all the late-game heroics belonged to the opponent, and the Wildcats were left to contemplate what could have been.

INJURY REPORT: Center Martin Ides (sprained ankle) is probable, while forward Emeka Erege (lower leg) remains day-to-day.

Finally, Wildcats find victory against UNCG

GREENSBORO—You knew this game had to end like this. Somehow. Even when the Wildcats commanded a 10-point lead, and their sharpshooters couldn’t miss, your gut told you these wily Spartans would somehow take the Wildcats down to the last second. That’s just the way this series goes. Before Wednesday night, a combined eight points had decided the last three contests between Davidson and UNC Greensboro, with the Spartans winning all three. Wednesday night did little to increase that margin. A desperate jumper by Courtney Eldridge missed its mark as time expired Wednesday night at Fleming Gym, and Davidson held on to beat UNC-G, 58-57, handing the Spartans their first home loss of the season. The win gave Davidson a two-game lead in the race for the North Division title.

Eldridge, who spoiled a home win for the Wildcats last season when he hit a buzzer-beating 30-foot jumper, laid silently on the floor with his arm across his face Wednesday night as his teammates exchanged handshakes and filed out of the arena. “This was a big win because we’ve lost close games to this team in the past,” said head coach Bob McKillop. “I tried to erase it from [the players’] minds, but I just couldn’t.” Unable—or unwilling—to forget the past, the Wildcats channeled those memories into intensity Wednesday night in front of a sizable crowd of Wildcat supporters that made the 90-minute drive from Davidson. After falling behind 5-0 early, Davidson reeled off 12 unanswered points and never trailed again. Michael Bree’s back-to-back three-pointers fueled the run that set the pace for the remainder of the half.

The Spartans fought to close the gap during the second period, and they gained momentum as Davidson’s shooters went cold. But the Wildcat defense would not break. “It was tough to hold them off because we kept getting good looks at the basket and missing them,” said McKillop. “But tonight’s game was about tough, tremendous defense. Any team that plays great defense is going to be successful.” Davidson allowed the Spartans to shoot just 37 percent from the field. The Wildcats—specifically Nick Booker—held Greensboro’s leading scorer James Maye (15.9 ppg) to just three points. Booker’s relentless coverage held Maye scoreless the entire second half. “This was Nick’s finest game as a Wildcat,” said McKillop.

It was from the charity stripe that Greensboro inflicted the most damage. The Spartans went 8-for-11 from the line in the second half, including David Shuck’s two free throws with 44 seconds left that ignited the crowd and narrowed Davidson’s lead to one, 58-57. With Chris Pearson having fouled out and Martin Ides on the bench grimacing in pain, an ice bag strapped to his ankle, the Wildcats used a small lineup to nurse their fragile lead for the remaining 44 seconds. “We had a feeling it might come down to the wire,” said junior guard Wayne Bernard. “But we were just determined to come out and attack and not relent.” Pearson led the attack, scoring a game-high 14 points. He also led the team in rebounding with nine boards. “The defensive intensity by both teams was absolutely sensational tonight,” said McKillop. “Everybody who scored tonight earned their points.”
