### Davidson Future Safeguarded With Adjacent Land Holdings
By BRUCE CORSER, Asst. Managing Editor

The campus of Davidson College presently includes some 465 acres of contiguous land. This compares favorably with other campuses of
similar schools. President Samuel R. Spencer Jr., commenting on this acreage, said, “We are fortunate to have what we have.”
He added that the college owed a debt to Grier Martin, past president, for nearly doubling the area from a
previous total of 250 acres.

Spencer noted that the college was “pretty well fixed” and that he “couldn’t foresee a time when 465 acres would
be inadequate.” He further pointed out that acquiring land in the vicinity was difficult both because of the extreme expense
and unavailability of such land. Business Manager Robert A. Currie said that the college likes to keep such land for
protection purposes. That is, to be able to exclude industry or other undesirable developments from blighting the campus area.

Spencer added that “we would be very reluctant to sell any contiguous land that we do have. No one knows
what our future plans might be.” The college also owns two other areas not a part of the immediately adjacent
campus area. The section on Lake Norman extends 96 acres and the McConnell farm district comprises 107 acres. Spencer remarked
that the McConnell farm tract might be developed for faculty housing purposes. This is presently being studied by a land
use expert.

Notably, two other sections were used for similar projects in past years. That space behind the infirmary and also some
land on the road going south to Concord are now the sites of faculty housing facilities. As for the improvement
of contiguous campus land, such as around the cross-country course, Spencer observed the possibilities of a golf course or more
athletic fields. However, something like a golf course would be a large capital expenditure and would probably have to come
in the form of an alumni gift.

Another hope for the future might be what Spencer termed an “additional participation gym.” This might be simply a field
house with three to five basketball courts and added handball and squash areas. All these dreams are possible yet Spencer
emphasized that they come behind other priorities such as paying for the library, and building a new Union, chemistry, and
fine arts facilities.

Moreover, Vice President for Finance and Development C. David Cornell declared a definite reluctance to become involved in the real
estate business in managing either present land holdings or new acquisitions. He said that Davidson was simply not equipped to
become a “quasi-real estate operator.” Cornell related that in one instance three years ago the college sold land 10 miles
out of Charlotte donated by E. H. Little, rather than speculate on its value.

Davidson does now own land inside Charlotte. However, this land was a bequest that forbids the college to sell it.
So the land is now being leased for annual profit. Davidson also owns five acres on I-77 on which it
hopes to attract a prospective high-quality motel. Cornell said that the ad-

### Quakers To Solicit Assistance For Civilian War-Ravaged
By MICHAEL TANNER, Managing Editor

In early 1973, the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) initiated a million-dollar fund-raising drive in order to finance further aid
to the civilian sufferers of the Vietnam war. Next week, AFSC will canvass the dormitories of Davidson College. Sophomores Dickson
Phillips and Russel Carter, the volunteer representatives of AFSC on campus, will conduct the fund collecting on Monday night after
the showing of “Once Upon A War,” filmed at the Quaker Rehabilitation Center in Quang Ngai, South Vietnam.

AFSC, founded in 1917, is a Quaker service organization which offers aid to areas of strife, particularly those where high
civilian casualties are present. The organization, though founded and administered by Quakers, is presently non-denominational and international with current projects
in 18 countries abroad. In Vietnam, AFSC operates a prosthetics and rehabilitation center at Quang Ngai, where maimed civilian victims
of the war are fitted with artificial limbs. AFSC established the center at Quang Ngai in July of 1967, to
meet the needs of ever-increasing numbers of injured civilians.

According to a study conducted by Senator Edward Kennedy’s Subcommittee on Refugees, civilian casualties in Vietnam from 1965 through 1971
number 1.1 million. This figure includes 335,000 deaths and 80,000 surviving paraplegics and amputees. The film to be shown, “Once
Upon a War,” is a documentary which seeks to make known the terrible human cost of the American involvement in
Vietnam. The creation of British filmmaker and journalist Patricia Penn, the film is a study of what becomes of the
many civilians caught in the crossfire of the never-ending conflict.

The 30-minute film will be shown in Perkins at 3:30 p.m. and in Love at 10 p.m. on Monday. Commenting
on the activities of AFSC, Carter and Phillips emphasized that it is imperative that the American people be constantly reminded
that the civilian need in Vietnam still exists, despite the recent signing of the cease-fire and the myth of the
war's end.

“The most important point to be made about the project is that it gives the donor an opportunity to make
his own peace over there. A donation is a direct effort to help. It will give someone a new limb,”
he said. “We have a moral obligation to help these people. This isn’t a political drive of any sort, it
rises above all that mess,” Phillips added.Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

The administration had been in contact with a number of people though, as of yet, there has been no affirmative
response. He stated that this was due to the delay in the completion of Interstate 77. “It’s this indefinite quality
that scares our contacts,” he said. Yet he declared that he was still hopeful that someone would see the wisdom
of putting a motel at that site. Spencer summed up the college land situation when he observed that he was
“glad that we don't have any problems.” He added that the expanded enrollment will not have an effect on Davidson's
real estate holdings.

Students Explore Ageless Island
By RICHARD ROMEYN
Contributing Editor

(Ed. note: Romeyn is presently engaged in a biological study at the Sapelo Island Marine Institute for the entire Spring
Term. The following is a description of an afternoon spent on that remote unspoiled island.)

While the concrete turkey stood on his pedestal above the fountain, the red-roofed buildings lay basking in the sun. A
decrepit jeep squatted alongside the largest, and its engine sputtered and died. When momentarily two young men appeared in the
doorway, a loud “damn it” was heard to echo within the courtyard.

“Have you got the nets?” I asked.

“Yah.”

“And the boxes and stuff?”

“Yup, and I checked us out.”

“Ok, let's roll.”

The 1949 Willeys was missing a fender and inclined rather sharply to starboard. Although it had been junked twice on
the mainland, it is one of the most sought-after vehicles on the island, and so we complimented ourselves on being
able to grab it on a weekday afternoon. Reliable it was not. Two days before its right front wheel had
fallen off along the dike road causing its two surprised occupants to veer madly into the marsh. But she was
fixed now. There were gaping holes in the floor, and no brakes. When I rammed in the clutch, the four
cylinders roared, and we fled northward along the narrow dirt road dragging a cloud of dust.

The north end of Sapelo Island is a jungle. Moss hangs in heavy drippings from the live oaks and cedar,
and marshes and streams crisscross the island at random. Bristling acres of palmetto trees make cross-country travel impossible. Like the
rivers and the deer trails, what roads there are wander aimlessly in a pattern of right-angle turns and blind alleys.
Rolling northward over Raccoon Bluff, the altitude peak of the island at 16 feet, we meandered among the abandoned churches
and brush-choked cabin sites where a fragment of the island's black population once lived. There are about 200 blacks on
the island now. However, there were more in past years, and the island abounds with the colorful names of their
former settlements: Chocolate, Hang Bull, Long Tabby, Drink Water, Hog Hammock, Bell Marsh.

Suddenly, as the trails branched, our path ended in a sea of liquid mud. With the accelerator to the floor,
we slid through as I looked through the floor at the foaming mud and water below, a layer of cold
mud slithered down my leg to form a coating on my shoes. Finally, the jeep swept out into a clearing
of dense palmetto scrub with an impressive roar, causing two turkeys to flap reluctantly over the hedge. Across the creek
was the dense forest of Blackbeard Island, separated from Sapelo by a few hundred yards of impassable salt marsh. Like
Sapelo, it too is a wildlife preserve, famed for the size of its alligators and diamondback turtles, and as the
one-time haunt of the pirate Edward Teach for whom it was named. A fortune in treasure is reputed to lie
buried somewhere among the scrub that rises behind the marsh in a wall.

The sun was resting on the upturned branches of the live oaks when we bounced around the last turn and
drew up beside the duck pond. The duck pond is the symbol of wilderness on Sapelo. The small freshwater lake,
fringed with reeds, its glass sheet broken by coasting alligators and wading birds, is at the island's northernmost end. We
spent several hours exploring the unspoiled reaches and coves of the pond. With the approach of dusk and hordes of
mosquitoes, we returned to the jeep for the return trip. I gazed out over the bay and waited for the
usual roar and blast of fumes. But none came. There was silence as the engine was dead. As we walked
off into the forest, the mud dried on the hood where we had written “walking to Chocolate.”

Chocolate (a corruption of the original name of La Chalet) is the ruin of a once fine plantation where a
few ancient pecan trees shade the tabby skeletons of the island's bygone era. Where once Geechee (the Negro dialect of
English still widely spoken on the island) rattled in the breeze, only the rustle of leaves prevails. Two hours and
six miles passed. The sun had disappeared and we were deep within the forest. Unconcerned deer browsed in the open
places as we hurried by. The rustle of leaves suggested that untold millions of rattlers stalked us from the underbrush.
We felt no better when two large vultures appeared and kept pace with us for several miles, flying along from
tree to tree.

The forest absorbs noise well, and the truck was almost upon us before we saw it. It was our group
truck filled with guys who laughed when we yelled and waved. We clambered in amidst a barrage of questions. “Where
have you been?” “Get stuck?” I contemplated the mud and gnat bites on my legs. “Naw,” I said, “we just
spent some time exploring!”
