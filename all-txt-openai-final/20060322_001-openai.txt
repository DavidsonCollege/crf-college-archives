New English major
to affect class of 2008

By MONICA JAMOUNEAU
Sports Editor

After a long review, the English
department has chosen the require-
ments for its new major, presenting
the plan to students for the first
time in a Mar. 15 meeting.

The change will affect the class
of 2008 and all subsequent classes.
Certain allowances will be made
for declared majors who have
already completed some of the
courses toward the old major.

In 2004, the English department
began working on amending the
major with an external review
board in order to correct flaws in
the system.

Professors from other institu-
tions were called in to share their
opinions on the outdated curricu-
lum and suggest modifications.

“We talked amongst ourselves,”
chair of the English department
Elizabeth Mills said at the meeting.
“One of the things we identified [as
needing change] was the design of
the major itself.”

The external review board con-
sisted of professors from UNC-
Chapel Hill and Pomona College,
whose differing student population
sizes were a helpful factor in the
deliberations.

After creating a proposed cur-
riculum, Mills met with the regis-
trar and the education policy com-
mittee.

The changes were officially
approved by the faculty at a meet-
ing in February.

juniors and seniors will still

Union and Commons
see increase in theft

By KATIE PFEIFFER
Senior Staff Writer

An increase in incidents of steal-
ing food from Vail Commons and
the Union Café has caused Dining
Services to monitor food areas
more closely to discourage poten-
tial thieves.

The dining hall has experienced
ongoing problems with students
leaving the building carrying food.
Students intend to bring the food
back to their rooms for later con-
sumption.

Storing food in backpacks and
other types of bags has also created
difficulties as far as monitoring
how much food is being carried out
of Commons.

“Vail is an all-you-can-eat facili-
ty, but our budget is set up antici-
pating that we are not also provid-
ing snacks or additional meals to
students after they leave the facili-
ty,” Director of Auxiliary Services
Richard Terry said. “A meal plan is
payment for meals eaten in Vail
only.”

Students will not necessarily be
reprimanded for leaving Commons
while in the process of finishing
food, according to Terry, but they
may receive punishment for leav-
ing with unopened food, depending
on the decision of Dining Services.

“Some employees do get upset.
If it gets to be too much, you’ve got
to stop them,” Commons Cashier
John Harper said. “This time of

RED AND BLACK

year it’s hard [to monitor how
much food is taken] because stu-
dents eat outside.”

Despite some leniency in deter-
mining what is okay to take, there
are signs in place that prohibit stu-
dents from taking food and alert
them that stealing is an Honor
Code violation.

Many students have commented
on their frustration over not having
more freedom to use their meal
plans.

“I think taking apples from
Commons is fine—if I put it on my
tray, I feel like I should be able to
save it for later instead of wasting
it,” Melissa Bandy ’06 said. “But at
the Union, where there are prices
on each apple, it’s not okay.”

The rising cost of food, particu-
larly in the Union Café, has also
made students angry because they
are being stopped for extraneous
charges, such as condiments.

“I think a lot of people steal from
the Union because they feel they
get ripped off,” Bron Tennis ’06
said. “The Union steals from us.”

The most popular items for theft
at the Union Café include individ-
ual tea packets and small packaged
items, such as Uncrustables sand-
wiches.

In February, the Union’s records
showed that it had sold 1,500 tea
packets, when in reality over 3,000
were gone. Since then, the tea has

Peace march
to be held
on Sunday

By KATE GILLESPIE
News Editor

A march against the war in
Iraq and Afghanistan will take
place in Davidson this Sunday.

Participants in the march,
which begins at 2 p.m., will gath-
er at the intersection of Main and
Griffith Streets and walk down
Main Street to the town hall.

Davidson resident Hugh
Casey, a former lawyer in
Charlotte, planned the march
after a letter he wrote in October
received no response from local
senators and congressional repre-
sentatives.

In the letter, Casey said that he
was opposed to the wars in Iraq
and Afghanistan and held the
politicians responsible for the
United States’ involvement in
these wars.

“I wrote the letter to see if I
could get a response out of
them,” Casey said. “This country
is founded upon the Constitution,
and the Constitution provides
that Congress shall declare war,
not the president himself. Bush
never did that. He’s violated the
Constitution of the United States,
