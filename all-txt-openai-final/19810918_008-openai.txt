**DAVIDSONIAN**

**Blow-up explodes; Express races**

Nick Graham

Just when you thought that it was safe to open the Davidsonian again... yes, rather like Dracula rising from the grave or Ingrid Bergman walking into Rick’s Cafe, Nick’s Flicks has risen again to regale you with some quick wit and ready repartee at least tenuously connected with this term’s Fine Films schedule. After a summer of ogling either at Karen Allen in sheer silk dresses with nothing beneath them, or Christopher Reeve in blue lurex tights (depending on your preference), the apprentice cinephiles of Davidson College have many rich moments in store.

**Blow-up**

During the summer some of you may well have taken in Brian de Palma’s latest feature *Blow-Out*, a fine thriller which takes as its point of departure the idea that the hapless John Travolta becomes a so-called “ear-witness” of a murder when he records the sounds of gunfire. Without wishing to disparage de Palma, this plot is taken almost wholesale from Michelangelo Antonioni’s 1966 masterpiece *Blow-Up*, which is this week’s Fine Film.

As the change in title suggests, the original has a photographer rather than a sound technician as the hero, and Antonioni fully exploited the relationship between the arts of moving and still pictures to produce a tantalizingly beautiful homage to the capabilities of the all-seeing eye of the camera lens. David Hemmings here plays a successful fashion photographer who, while taking pictures of two lovers in a London park, accidentally captures evidence of a murder. His realization that what he has seen actually is a murder only crystallizes (of course) much later when the photographs are printed, and much of the first half of the film is taken up with his increasingly obsessive and technically impressive attempts to isolate the incriminating evidence in a series of huge blow-ups of the scene of the crime.

However, when his studio is raided by persons unknown, and his prints removed, the film slides into altogether darker territory as Hemmings slowly begins to doubt whether he actually saw anything in the park at all: there is no body, witnesses cannot be found, friends are either too bored or too stoned to assist him. The truth-telling eye of the camera, it is suggested to us, is fallible after all, indeed is unreliable in an altogether disturbing fashion. In the second half of the film, the Hemmings character is stripped of his defenses against life in the modern metropolis in a ruthless fashion, in a manner much more recognizably the province of Antonioni.

The Italian director was working in English for the first time, and interestingly enough in color for only the second, largely on the strength of his success with *Il Deserto Rosso* in the previous year, which had distinctly un-Italian Richard Harris contemplating his capitalist navel during a trenchantly proletarian labor dispute in the industrial wasteland of Ravenna. The favorite of hip Anglo-American audiences for several years, he was then taken off to London, at that time swinging with all the lunatic energy of the sixties, in order to make this film, fairly freely adapted from a story by Jorge Luis Borges. Antonioni manages to inject into the film a commendably powerful dose of existentialist angst, although whether, 15 years on, it is enough to lift the film out of the realm of social archaeology and into that of Cinema-as-Art is open to question. His relentless pursuit of the illusion-making abilities of the camera inevitably tends to invite the question of whether or not Antonioni views his own art, or at least its technical procedures, as a sham. Certainly, the film...captures the viewer’s attention in a series of situations which are repeatedly revealed as substanceless fictions, to the ultimate confusion of all concerned. The things to watch for in the first half are the ways in which Hemmings’ image and place in his own world are established: with an army of submissive assistants working for him in the darkroom, he can spend his time in steamy photo-sessions with Jane Birkin or relax with a brace of willing nymphet-groupies. As the film proceeds, the photographer becomes increasingly isolated, and his wanderings around a grimly hostile nocturnal London cut through the glamour and noise of the historical period to leave an image of the city more obviously associated with the seventies than the previous decade. The sole relief comes when he wanders into a club and finds The Yardbirds playing there. Of particular interest to rock historians, this is the short-lived five-man version of the band when Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page were playing guitar. In the event, Beck destroys his instrument with almost Townsendian grace and our hero retreats into the night. The film both begins and ends with the same image—a group of street actors play a game of tennis without balls. The implications for the film are perhaps slightly ironic here, but Antonioni prosecutes his intentions with considerable wit, and you will have to go to see the film to find out the truth about the murder. Coming on Wednesday, in Love at 8:00 pm.

Midnight Express

Showing tonight in Pop Films is a rather excellent British production, Midnight Express directed by Alan Parker. More or less fictionalized from an apparently true account, it concerns the fate of Billy Hayes, an American college student who attempts to smuggle some recreational vegetable matter out of Turkey at the end of his summer vacation. As soon becomes apparent, the Turkish judiciary take exception to this sort of behavior and imprison him for a long stretch. The film details his adjustment to prison life and his attempts to escape—to take the Midnight Express of the title—the only way out of his harrowing, degrading ordeal. The film was banned in Turkey itself and engendered considerable xenophobic resentment, not so much, one suspects, for the portrayal of ruthlessly sadistic warders as for the fact that the judiciary are shown to be entirely sensitive to political expediency. Prize performances are most notable by John Hurt as a drug-crazed English veteran prisoner and the actor—whose name escapes me—who played the obese and brutalized chief warder. To its further credit, the film addresses the subject of prison homosexuality in a commendable fashion and maintains a fierce realism in its documentation of our hero’s descent through the degradation of violence, and finally madness, before his near-miraculous escape to Greece. Highly recommended, if strong stuff, this film.

Visulite

Coming to the Visulite this week are two exceptional features of the film-about-film variety. Stuntman stars Peter O’Toole as a possibly homicidal director harboring a fugitive from justice masquerading as a stuntman and is highly recommended. Francois Truffaut’s La Nuit Américaine (Day for Night) is probably the finest film ever made about the cinema itself and stars Truffaut himself as director along with a host of his regular players including the excellent Jean-Pierre Léaud. Full of affectionate references to Truffaut’s previous work, the film is irresistibly charming, its humor always rising above the ever-present undertone of personal tragedy. Cancel all other engagements and go to see it.
