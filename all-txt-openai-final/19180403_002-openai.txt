**Our Position**

For four years now The Davidsonian has existed; and yet when we pause and think a moment, we realize that
there has been something more than mere existence. Pick up the four issues for any corresponding dates in the last
four years and it will not be hard to trace a certain growth, a progress. This advance is not due
to any superior intelligence on the part of succeeding staffs but to the fact that through age comes a sense
of greater stability and assurance. It is due to a wider experience resulting from the profiting by, and adding to,
the general experience and knowledge of former staffs and editors; to increased circulation and advertising space in a six-page instead
of a four-page publication; and to the keeping up with college journalism, which has without doubt grown and advanced in
the last four or five years. Thus we are deeply indebted to former editorial staffs, and it is up to
us at least to equal their standards.

**Our Aims**

In a year of such uncertainty as this is sure to be, it is difficult to say what we will
do. And yet, disregarding anything unforeseen, we are safe in stating our aims: to publish the representative news of the
college in an attractively written six-page sheet; to make the paper a channel through which students and alumni may express
their opinions and ideas, thus promoting interest and thought in all connected with the institution; in an impartial way to
uphold those things which are for the best interests of the college, and to condemn that which is detrimental and
harmful; to promote a better spirit of fellowship on the campus; and last but not least, to draw the alumni
closer together and to keep them in touch with their Alma Mater by giving them in these columns a true
account of all the activities of college life. All this The Davidsonian staff aims to do, and it is hoped
that the alumni, the faculty, and the student body may so co-operate this year that it may be the most
successful the college has ever known.

Drill in the afternoon, in some respects, is a decided improvement over that in the early morning. It should add
materially to the interest as it will make it possible to have open field maneuvers and sham battles, and give
an opportunity to go through the ceremonies of retreat every afternoon. It is unlikely that it will conflict with baseball,
track, and other activities. Men having such conflicts from baseball will of course be excused from drill. Yet there are
quite a few going out for track, and as there are a number interested in the rumored spring tennis tournament,
it has been questioned whether drill would eliminate these. There is no reason why it should, as from dinner time
to five-fifteen is surely time enough to get all the exercise anyone wants. But should anyone disagree with this, it
has been suggested that drill be held directly after supper, and by a concerted action of the students it could
no doubt be arranged to have it at this hour.

This Easter was decidedly different from that first Easter Sunday eighteen hundred and eighty-nine years ago. And yet that same
old struggle against absolutism is still going on.

Here's to the new Y. M. C. A. cabinet as it comes into office, and may it have a most
successful year.

The service flag has been lying peacefully on a table in the gym now since Junior Speaking. It would look
a lot better hanging up in the Library or even in chapel. Who has charge of it?

Don’t forget the American University Union. Have you contributed?

As this issue goes to press the Davidson warriors are setting out on a warpath into South Carolina, Georgia, and
Florida. Watch their home-coming next week with a string of scalps hanging from their bats.

It's a good thing the Davidson battalion doesn't have to depend on the rapid completion of the trench below Mr.
Hill’s house for protection from the ‘Boches.

If everyone would turn up their clocks an hour, keep the same schedules as before, and forget about the sun,
there would be much less discussion, loss of time, and trouble.

The Lyceum last Saturday night easily came up to the other numbers of this year and concluded probably one of
the best courses that has been on the Hill for several years.

**War for Humanity**

War, in a good cause, is not the greatest evil which a nation can suffer. War is an ugly thing,
but not the ugliest of things; the decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks nothing worth
a war is worse. When a people are used as mere human instruments for firing cannon or thrusting bayonets, in
the service for selfish purposes of a master, such war degrades a people. A war to protect other human beings
against tyrannical injustice; a war to give victory to their own ideas of right and good, and whichis their own
war, carried on for an honest purpose by their free choice. It is often the means of their regeneration. A
man who has nothing which he is willing to fight for, nothing which he cares more about than he does
about his personal safety, is a miserable creature, who has no chance of being free, unless made and kept so
by the exertions of better men than himself. As long as justice and injustice have not terminated their ever-renewing fight
for ascendency in the affairs of mankind, human beings must be willing, when need is, to do battle for the
one against the other.—John Stuart Mill.

This was written a half century and more ago, but it might have been written yesterday it applies so well
to today’s conditions. The truth is the same yesterday, today, and tomorrow.

DR. MARTIN ATTENDS SYNOD IN GREENSBORO

A special call meeting of the North Carolina Synod was held in Greensboro on last Thursday with seventy-five delegates present,
the purpose of the meeting being to discuss the question of the coalition of Peace Institute and Queens College. There
was much discussion and upon a motion of Dr. W. J. Martin it was decided to accept the property of
these two colleges for the Synod. A motion that there be inaugurated a women’s department at Davidson that would give
an “A-1” education was made. This caused much comment, but was finally voted down. The final action of the Synod
was to accept the property of these two institutions and to combine them in one institution at the most advantageous
location in the State. The committee was authorized to ask for bids from cities in this State to decide upon
the location. The boards of trustees of these two colleges were instructed to continue the operations of the institutions at
their own risk, if they so desired, until this Why not a North Carolina Presbyterian girls’ college in the State?
Here’s to the success of the movement. North Carolina Presbyterian girls deserve such.

QUELQUES AUTOBIOGRAPHIES

“Je suis Juillet. J’ai trente et un jours. Les Romains m'ont mis sur le calendrier et m’ont donné le nom
que je porte à la mémoire de Jules César. Cérès me donne des fleurs, des fruits, et des légumes. J'ai
apporté aux États-Unis la Déclaration de l'Indépendance; à la France, la Révolution et la République. Et quand je reviens encore
j'espère apporter la paix aux malheureuses nations, les États-Unis, la France, la Russie, l'Angleterre, la Serbie, la Belgique, et même
à la Turquie et à l’Allemagne.”

“Je suis un bon chat blanc. Je suis mort déjà huit fois. Quand j’avais deux mois une brique m’est tombée
sur le cou, et me l’a cassé. On m'a jeté deux fois dans le fleuve. Mon maître et moi, nous
y sommes tombés deux fois. Une fois on m’a mis dans un sac, et m’a laissé sur le chemin de
fer. C’était là une terrible façon de quitter la vie. Un jour quelques chiens m’ont chassé, et je suis mort
de peur et de fatigue. On m'a dérobé deux fois la vie, moyennant le chloroforme. Je vis à présent dans
un état de peur continuelle, parce que, maintenant, je n'ai plus qu'une seule fois à mourir.”

WEBSTER'S STAND.

I was born an American; I live an American; I shall die an American; and I intend to perform the
duties incumbent upon me in that character to the end of my career. I mean to do this with absolute
disregard of personal consequences. What are the personal consequences? What is the individual man, with all the good or evil
that may betide him, in comparison with all the good or evil that may betide a great country; and in
the midst of great transactions which concern that country’s fate? Let the consequences be what they will, I am careless.
No man can suffer too much or no man can fall too soon, if he suffer, or if he fall
in the defense of the liberties and constitution of his country.—Daniel Webster.
