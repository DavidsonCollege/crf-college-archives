Wildcat Cross Country Team Beats State

SPORTS AFIELD

Undaunted Dazzlers Point To Centre

BY BILL MARQUESS

In response to the petition presented last week, the Athletic Association has refused to recognize soccer at Davidson as a minor sport, although more financial support has been given to the team. In refusing to give the team official recognition, the Association argues that, although there are quite a few men here at present who are good soccer players, this is not a very popular sport in these southern states and when these men graduate, there may not be any to take their places on the team.

To those who have never seen a soccer game: don't miss a game on the campus this year. For an hour or so of downright enjoyment, individual team play, and always brilliance, it has been a source of real entertainment to Davidson audiences.

Orchids For Teeny

Those Tech mentors entertain a healthy respect for the Wildcats. Backfield Coach Bobby Dodd, a teammate of Gene McEver’s at Tennessee, scouted the Duke-Davidson game. When he reported to his boss, Coach Alexander, another Tech scout was in the room. The trio talked for a moment about such backs as Ace Parker, Eric Tipton, and Colman and Davis of Kentucky. “Best football player I’ve seen in a long time,” broke in Dodd, “is a fellow named Teeny Lafferty on this Davidson team. He does everything. He’s the best broken-field runner I’ve seen in years.”

Full of spills and thrills, the Cats Defeat NCS Harriers By Big Score

Harriers Beat Wolfpack By Score of 16-43

Sweet places, Wildcat cross country varsity defeated North Carolina State on Saturday, scoring their second Southern Conference victory of the season. The tape was broken by Boo Walker of Davidson in the time of 18:20.3 on the five-mile course. Dave Wessell followed in second place, with Parcell and Bob Keating tying for third place. Hunter of N. C. State was the fifth man to arrive and the first for his team. Wick Telford finished sixth to complete the ‘Cat team scoring. George and Dick Gammon, although finishing back, increased Davidson’s score because each man tallies the number of his place at the end of the race. The men of each team count their places, the team with the lowest score wins.

Davidson’s next meet is October 23, when they encounter the strong Duke Blue Devils. The Guilford varsity defeated the Carolina State team last week by a narrow margin, so the Davidson harriers must consider the hard race ahead. The team travels to Atlanta, Ga., October 28 to meet Georgia Tech in a triangular meet.

Freshman Harriers Hold First Trials

Trials for the freshman cross-country team were held on October 14. Green won and was closely followed by Nick Schiltz and John Hay. These three ran the five-mile course in less than twenty-five minutes. Coach Frank was well pleased with the performance of the squad as a whole. The other men came in as follows: Norris Erb, Ed Wilson, Bill Lemmon, and Bob Williams. Coach Brown stated that these men would not necessarily compose the frosh team as there is to be another time trial before the first meet, which is to be held here. This will be on Saturday, October 23, with Lees-McCrae. Later in the season, the frosh harriers will take on the University of North Carolina Freshmen. This meet will be at Chapel Hill. A meet with the Wofford College freshmen is also expected.

The only male enrolled in the economics course at Purdue must wear a bright pink powder-puff sewed to the top of his freshman cap. He wants to become a dietitian.

Juniors Beat All Teams to Capture Title

Sophs Must Beat Frosh For Second Place

By virtue of winning four straight games during the past week, the Junior Juggernaut won the fall intramural football program. Runners up for the title could not be learned as one game was left to be played as the paper went to press. In the first game of the week, the luckless Sophomores staged a comeback and whipped the Frosh by a 12-0 score. The Frosh’s inability to watch the “sleepers” resulted in two touchdown passes, Hunter to Casali, proving to be the margin of victory.

In a fast game between the Juniors and Seniors, in which neither team could put across a score, the Juniors won on first downs, the score being 4-0. In the next game, the Juniors again showed their power by pinning the Sophomores back 12-6. Marquess caught two touchdown passes from Johnson and Tice for the winners.

Against South Carolina last Saturday, Bill Davis filled the shoes of the injured Teeny Lafferty and turned in a sterling performance. After piling up a large margin of first downs, the Sophomores won their second game of the tournament. Finally, a pass, Hunter to Ogburn, scored the only touchdown of the day, proving the winning margin.

In the next game, the Junior Juggernaut turned on their power again and set the Frosh back, 18-0. Tice, Marquess, and Monger scored all the touchdowns.

Iverson

Davidson's six-foot-four end, Ned Iverson, has been playing fine ball this year. Against South Carolina, this pass-snaging lad played the full sixty minutes.

Frosh Tennis in Semi-Finals

The freshman tennis tournament reached the semi-finals this week with Miller Sproull and Jack Spainhour being the first two to reach this point. The Colonels have practically the same team that they had last year with a few additions. They use a modified Tennessee system very similar to the one that Davidson uses. Their first team averages about 185 pounds. The outstanding men in the line are Duval and Lee.

Varsity Fall Tennis

The varsity fall tennis tournament is in the third round with two of the contestants in the semi-finals. Tee Chorociinmewarlace Conine, seeded No. 2 in the tournament, advanced to the semi-finals with a 9-7, 3-6, 6-0 victory over George Jones, who gave Tee much unexpected competition. Dick Shore defeated Billy Warner, seeded number one. Jim Reinhardt, seeded No. 3 in the tournament, also advanced to the semi-finals.

Wildcats Drop Hard Fought Struggle to Carolina Gamecocks Lafferty Nursing Shoulder Injury Unable to Get Into Scrap; Spark Play of Battling ’Cats For the second time in as many weeks the Davidson Wildcats, minus their plug, Teeny Lafferty, dropped a one-touchdown decision, this time to the highly regarded South Carolina Gamecocks by 12-7. The South Carolina boys pushed over two markers in the second period, while the ’Cats put over theirs in the final stanza and added the extra point. Led by the brilliant all-round play of Captain Bailey Williams and Fred Dennis, the ‘Cats never stopped trying, but without Lafferty they were not quite able to continue a sustained drive. The Wildcats started out like a house-a-fire when on the first play Dennis broke through the Gamecock line, and raced 25 yards down the field, and sidelines. But on the next play Clary, a thorn in the Davidson sides all evening, grabbed one of Dennis’ passes on his shoe-tops and returned to the 40. The ’Cats held however and the Roosters were forced to kick. Later in the same period Dennis intercepted a Carolina pass, and then Williams got off a beautiful 70-yard punt which was downed on the South Carolina one-yard line. The Gamecocks however kicked out of danger. In the second quarter Williams fumbled a shaky pass from center and it was the Gamecock’s ball on the Davidson 30. The Wildcats fought savagely here, but Capt. Gene Lyons faded back and on a long delayed pass sent the ball over the goal to Lonchar for the first score. The Davidsons rushed the kicker and the ball went wide for no extra point. Again, just before the half ended, the white-clad warriors had pushed across another score, following an intercepted pass.
