**Tur Davisonian PERSPECTIVES ~ WEDNESDAY, APRIL 21, 2004**

**Building up Spring Frolics weekend**

In places this weekend, we’ll walk on dappled grass, barefoot under the pines of Patterson Court. Waiting in line to throw ourselves around in the moonwalk, a quick cloud will cover us in a short-lived strong shade until the sun turns white its gray edges on another dappling of a greater scale. The houses will stink of sweat and stale, spilled beer. The dance floor will writhe like a thinker’s fist against face. Amidst too many thongs and buckets of cologne, between a boozed booty shaking and a drunken grind, a new couple will press their sweaty foreheads together and begin to love. On the porch outside, we’ll smoke and ask if you’ve started that paper yet. Good, neither have I. The pinpricks in the black velvet expanse above us will be out, covered some moments by high gathered mists. When some of us laugh, we’ll chuckle with our heads thrown back and the seven planets visible this spring will wink back at us. We’ll feel a buzzing rush and a keen self-awareness as we look back down at the crowd and smile a smile nobody needs to see.

After class on Friday, we rushed to our houses, our dorms, our homes. Everyone we knew walked away from work, they threw down, hung out, came ‘round. Beirut tables sprouted like mushrooms in a shade, solo cups for spores. Outside on our lawns, between Sentelle and Cannon, in front of Belk, boom boxes combined to play a mix stranger than anything DJ Mighty Mouse might conjure.

On the porch outside, we'll smoke and ask if you've started that paper yet. Good, neither have I. Soon our backs itched just out of groping backwards reaches. They itched from landing in the grass with our shirts off after sliding headlong down the yellow plastic trail, lubed by a garden hose, back-stopped with hay. Our backs itch in that just unscratchable spot and so we slide down the slide facing the marble sky. After the parties, we’ll walk past the tall corner of Belk Dorm. Raising our chins, we’ll see a rectangle light for a window on the top floor. Inside, we’re hall mates, playing the guitar and resting on a beanbag chair. We finish our beer. We keep walking past the 24-hour computer lab; no one is inside. Out on Chambers Lawn, lamp posts shine like lowered constellations; cat-card readers fail with shrieking exclamations. Swipe, clunk, the door opens. The night is over.

On Saturday, after we each muse over our respective newly collected recollections of Friday, we’ll decide to do it again. Because again we felt a future retrospective thrill we once felt on Wednesday. Strive, Davidsonians, strive to imagine now, as you sit surrounded by papers and problems, the weekend ahead. The more you yearn for it now, the more then it will shimmer and sparkle. Raise your expectations for how much fun you can have. Take some of that diligence so often wasted on the library and expend the same amount of effort on having fun, lounging in the slanting sun. You will still get into law school if you don’t work this weekend. Your GPA is just a number, and hey—break the mold a little bit this weekend, ok?

**Nature of the Presidency still significant**

By JOSEPH ADAMS, Guest Columnist

While public opinion has been shifting in favor of President Bush in recent weeks, there also seems to have been an upsurge in attacks on the president. At last week’s White House press conference, reporters repeatedly asked President Bush to belittle himself before the Nation. One reporter demanded the president take the blame—the reporter called it “personal responsibility”—for the September 11 terrorist attacks. Another enjoined the president to highlight in what ways, exactly, he considers himself a failure. After Bush dismissed these questions, the media responded as if the president had given them the Potemkin-tour of the White House.

However, what many seem to not grasp when attacking this president is how some of their loudest criticisms are rooted not in this president or even his political philosophy but in the institutional nature of the presidency itself. The administration’s policy for conducing Iraq toward democracy has been frequently attacked for what many consider an imprudent June 30 deadline for transferring power from the Coalition Provisional Authority to Iraqis. The basic argument is that the deadline, like much of Bush’s approach to post-war Iraq, was influenced or even driven by the looming presidential election in November. It remains fairly clear that a transfer of power to Iraqis at any point in the near future would be problematic unless conditions dramatically improve in the country. However, it should also be clear that this critique of Bush—for allowing the American political system to influence, constrain, or control his decisions—is itself problematic. It implies that a president can somehow transcend or even ignore the accountability he has to the people in our quadrennial presidential elections, while this criticism sheds no light on how it is possible—much less why it is necessary—for a president to somehow conquer or even simply ignore the constraints of his office.

More than anything, the June 30 deadline and this president’s overall approach to post-war Iraq suggests that Bush is keenly aware that he may not be the U.S. president at the time when Iraq is finally and truly ready for self-rule. It also seems that Bush understands how the presidency is fundamentally different from the judiciary and legislative branches of government. While making day-to-day decisions is considered inherent to the presidency, the same is not true of the judiciary and legislature, which attempt to balance the perpetual prudence of sound judgment with the occasional need for prompt action. Criticisms of Bush on Iraq and other issues often reflect a misunderstanding by his critics of this important and laudable aspect in our political system.

A failure to grasp the nature of the presidency might explain a further misunderstanding that has emerged most prominently in the September 11 Commission hearings, which is that the tragedy of September 11 more strongly affected the American president than the American presidency. A failure to understand this important distinction doesn’t just make for poor political discourse. It hurts the nation by drawing us into debates that serve no other purpose than to distract us from the monumental challenges we face. Mr. Bush’s critics would be wise to clear up these misunderstandings and to levy sound and principled arguments against his policies, not his office. Indeed, in a yearWith important decisions on the horizon, the American public deserves no less.

Breaking out of Davidson categorizations

There is only one more edition of The Davidsonian after this week. With that in mind, I would like to bestow some almost-final deep thoughts from a Cuban:

There are four groups of people at Davidson. The first is composed of people who were not blessed by the Lord with a great amount of intelligence. They either work themselves to death and barely manage to graduate, or they are the members of your freshman hall who “choose” not to come back next year.

The second group is made up of intelligent people who don’t place academics on the top of their priority list. School work is simply another part of the college experience for them; it’s not the reason for life.

The third is the relatively intelligent people whose sole purpose at Davidson is to do school work. These are the people who go from their dorm, to Chambers, to Commons, to the library, then back to their dorms to be in bed before 11—midnight if there’s a test the next day. Occasionally, a super-fun, special excursion to the movies may be organized by these people on Friday nights. However, due to guilt caused by having fun, the following Saturday must be devoted to re-reading that difficult bio chapter.

The fourth group are the few and the proud who have a 3.8 and above. They are not only very smart, they also work hard. They may, very rarely, “take a break” and let loose with a night of debauchery. Their personalities vary—some are annoying, some are great people—but the incessant drive to succeed is their defining characteristic.

Which group are you? Do you like what you are doing with your time here? Should your time at Davidson be about learning as much knowledge as possible to be “smarter,” or should it be about increasing your depth and breadth of experience to become wiser? Which group are you? Do you like what you are doing?

Go abroad. Get a different perspective on life. I know, I know, the pre-med program doesn’t allow you time for such a frivolity. Well, screw the pre-med program. Quit attempting to be your father and go learn about yourself. Nothing facilitates that more than leaving the security blanket of the U.S. Make sure you travel by yourself at some point, too.

Don’t let the social group you’re now affiliated with define who your friends are for all four years at Davidson. Meet some new people who live by you, join a club sport, or extend an “in class” friendship (you know, those people you know from class who you nod hello to for a semester afterwards then stop acknowledging) to something more. Yes, I know, there are a lot of awful people out there, and your friends are obviously really cool so you need no one else. Well, guess what? If you think that, you’re probably one of the awful people.

Lastly (for this article anyways), come out this weekend. It is spring frolics. Go frolic. It should be a taste of a “real” college experience at Davidson. I don’t care if you hate fraternities and everything they stand for, blah, blah. Come out and let loose for a weekend. If you don’t have fun then you can return to the library Sunday afternoon. But please, give fun a chance.

Brown v. Board anniversary calls us to keep working for rights

By Krista HIGH
Guest Columnist

When, in 1954, the United States Supreme Court overturned the Plessy v. Ferguson decision, ruling that “separate is not equal,” my parents were toddlers. Years later, although the Brown v. Board of Education decision began the process of desegregating American schools, my mother was the first student of African-American descent to integrate her high school. Both of my parents were among the first students to integrate their college in the 1970s. Even then, when the benefits reaped from the Civil Rights Movement were at their height, “equality” didn’t come as quickly as some had hoped.

Today, fifty years after the Brown v. Board of Education decision was made, I find myself wondering how far we’ve really come. There is more distance today between the “haves” and the “have-nots” than there was fifty years ago. In the year 2004, statistics show that schools are re-segregating and larger disparities exist between the quality of education received by students in urban, inner-city areas and those in more affluent, middle-class communities. To me, this does not seem like the progress people hoped for after segregation was ruled unconstitutional.

When considering the legacy of the Brown v. Board of Education decision, mindful of the struggle of my parents (and others like them), it seems to me that too many people in our generation feel as if the work has already been done. Nowadays, we tend to be apathetic towards political issues unless they directly apply to us. Instead of striving for the creation of higher standards of equality, feeling like progress has already been made, we’re moving in a retrograde pattern, destroying the progress that was made years ago. Nowadays, we tend to be apathetic towards political issues unless they directly apply to us, and our appreciation of the social and economic gaps that still exist in this country are often overshadowed by the fact that we’re doing “okay.” Unfortunately, this attitude will be the cause of this society’s demise because we’re not all doing “okay” and it’s time for us—the next generation of leaders—to receive a much-needed reality check.

As Davidson College students, regardless of our individual political, social, and economic backgrounds, we are doing better than most and have opportunities that most people can only dream about. Being Davidson College students affords us such luxuries...but I often wonder if we truly understand what it means to have it so good. We have to learn how to be proactive members of society that won’t just accept the images we’re spoon-fed telling us that we’re all equal living in a happy society and the time for Civil Rights has passed. The time to push for Civil Rights has really just begun and our venue for enacting such positive change starts in the schools, it starts with re-educating the American way of life. Our society is still plagued with the ills of racism, classism, and political elitism, perhaps now more than ever. I hope that we’ll wake up, and continue to pass down the legacy that the Brown v. Board of Education decision placed on our shoulders.
