P.E. Dept. changes requirements for students

Under the guidance of Director of Physical Education and Recreation Sandy Helfgott, the P.E. Department is currently implementing a number of changes, including modifications in graduation requirements as well as new class options.

“I believe that students have been wanting a true physical education and recreation department for years,” Helfgott said. “This is a ridiculously athletic and fit campus, and I knew that if we offered the right classes, and enough of them, students would sign up.”

Helfgott’s hunch proved correct, and this semester over 400 students, nearly a quarter of the school’s population, enrolled in the various classes offered. This number is especially encouraging when compared to the substantially lower enrollment rates of past semesters.

“The perception of the Class of 2008 was that our department was a joke,” Helfgott said. “But I am confident that we can change that.”

It is clear that the department’s efforts are paying off, as students, such as Hannah Wright ’12, take advantage of new classes like spinning.

“All of the classes are really cool and surprisingly diverse,” Wright said. “There are some that I’d never even heard of.”

Some of the more eclectic classes offered this semester include waterskiing, sailing, belly dancing, tai chi, karate, “yogalates” and Budokon, a fusion of yoga, martial arts conditioning and meditation. Most classes meet once a week for a range of five to 12 weeks, making it easy for the ever-busy Davidson student to fit the required classes into their already packed schedules.

“We strongly believe that allowing students to choose activities of interest will only reinforce the importance of personal fitness and wellness,” Helfgott said.

In addition to expanding class offerings, the P.E. Department also revised the physical education graduation requirement. Previously, students were required to complete Davidson 101 in their first semester and one lifetime sport, one team sport and one water sport by the end of their sophomore year.

Beginning this year, however, the department will make no distinction between the water-related classes and other lifetime activity classes. Consequently, the team sport and Davidson 101 requirements will remain, while the curriculum is adjusted to incorporate two lifetime activity requirements, which now include the water-related classes.

“Because the overwhelming majority of students that had not fulfilled their requirements were missing their water credit and, realistically, we can only accommodate 70 to 80 students per semester in aquatic activities, we could not increase our aquatic programming without adding additional resources,” Helfgott said.

Thus, students may take a water sport as one of their two lifetime activity credits if they wish, but are not required to specifically take water classes. Students that do not pass the swimming evaluation during freshman orientation must still take a beginner swimming class, however.

In addition to these changes, students are no longer explicitly required to complete their P.E. credits by the end of sophomore year.

“Many were concerned that students would blow off or forget about the requirements until their senior year,” Helfgott, who proposed the curriculum change, said. “But I argued that we could not accommodate if every student wanted to...

The Student Government Association (SGA) focused on transportation issues at their last meeting. The discussion included bringing a Zipcar car-sharing service to campus and potentially making changes to the Community Bike program. Zipcar, Inc. is a company that rents cars hourly to members. Zipcar has partnerships with several colleges similar to Davidson, including Amherst and Smith in Massachusetts. According to Student Life Committee chair Meikaela Zwierynzski ’10, the college would pay Zipcar, Inc. a monthly fee (about $1500-$1700) per car, which covers all expenses, including gasoline, maintenance, and insurance. Students who wish to use the car would pay the college a subscription, giving them the option to rent the car at any time. Rental rates for the car would either be a seven-dollar hourly rate or a $60 daily rate. Senator Anahi Alvear ’11 voiced her support for the program, pointing out that it is often difficult for international students to get transportation and that the car-sharing service would make life easier.

The next step for the Student Life Committee is to begin surveying students regarding the number and types of cars that would be brought to campus. The committee will also be contacting the Pines, a local retirement community, and other organizations that may be interested in partnering with the college.

The second major topic of the meeting was the Community Bike program. The fleet of 30 bicycles endures considerable wear and tear as well as outright vandalism over the course of the year. As a result, approximately ten of those bicycles must be replaced annually. In addition, bicycles are often left lying in the grassy areas, a significant inconvenience for grounds crews. The senators recommended several solutions. The Student Life Committee plans to place several racks around campus that will be exclusively for use with community bicycles. Hopefully, students will place them in the racks, rather than tossing them to the ground. Another suggestion was to begin locking the bikes to the racks and having students pay a one-time, nominal fee for a key to the locks.

During the meeting, the SGA also selected Robert Lord Galloway ’09 and Ebony Harley ’09 as its nominees for Homecoming King and Queen, respectively. SGA also unanimously confirmed Marybeth Campeau ’11 for the position of Publicity Officer. Campeau currently has work-study with the college’s Communications Office, where she contributed to the Wildcat Handbook. Her experience collaborating with the office and its employees made her a natural fit for the position, according to SGA president Davis Greene ’09.

Before closing, Greene also announced that vacancies needed to be filled on two student advisory groups. One advisory group is with the Residence Life Office (RLO) and gives students (both RLO staff and unaffiliated) opportunities to provide feedback on housing policy—most recently on the decision to renovate Watts and Richardson Dormitories. The other is the Library Advisory Group which will meet directly with Library Director Jill Gremmels and provide input and feedback on library renovation plans.
