- Thurs., Jan. 30, 1941 THE DAVIDSONIAN Page Three Davidson’s Civic Club Helps Negro Center: Sets Aside Large Sum To
Seal. Snell Unable To Talk Here Clarence McArthur, Mac David McLean Community Center Coach McEver Supervises Completion Of Plan Sends
Letter Of Regret To Student Body Two WPA workers, Thomas Davidson's Civic Club, composed of ladies of the town, recently
set aside a sum of $75 to seal the David McLean Community Center. Coach Gene McEver supervised the completion of
this project. This building, built last year for the colored people of the community, was financed from the proceeds of
the 1939 YMCA Christmas gift fund. Shaw, and Lester Hunsucker, have been secured to help in the work with the
negroes. They are at present conducting a survey among the colored people to determine what kind of instruction they desire
besides that which is being offered by the YMCA and the Ladies’ Auxiliary of the Davidson Presbyterian Church. Classes in
adult education and a Boy Scout Troop are now sponsored by the YMCA. Efforts are being made to organize a
Girl Scout Troop, classes in cooking and sewing. The two young colored men plan to institute a nursery to care
for children of pre-school age whose mothers work and are unable to look after them properly. Plans are also being
considered for an employment agency, in which ladies of the Civic Club will cooperate to find jobs for unemployed colored
boys of the community. Courses Will Start July 1st For Officers War Department Announces Training According to information received from
the War Department, three-month courses will be established at the Infantry, Cavalry, Field and Coast Artillery schools beginning July 1,
1941, for the purpose of training Officer Candidates. To be eligible one must be either a warrant officer or an
enlisted man with at least six months active federal service prior to submitting an application. The maximum age limit is
18-36 years inclusive. J. Ray Snell, who was selected to be supported as a teaching missionary in China by Davidson
College, and who was planning to thank the Davidson Student Body in person, will not be able to come and
speak because he has accepted a three-month rush job in connection with national defense in Boston. Mr. Snell wrote an
open letter to the student body which read as follows: Brother Niven spent the weekend at home in Albemarle. Brother
Don William I have recently learned of your desire to support a young missionary in China, and wish to congratulate
you for this increasing interest in foreign missions. I feel greatly honored in having been selected by the Mission Board
to be supported by Davidson College. And to know that my work among students in China will be more worthwhile
and more appreciated because it is made possible by students in America. Although present tension in the East has detained
us, we are anxiously waiting our date of sailing. Meanwhile, it has seemed advisable to accept temporary work in Boston
with Consulting Engineers, and due to the nature and urgency of the work, I regret to say that I am
now unable to thank you in person. While the rest of the world is engaged in war and destruction, the
Chinese Christian Colleges continue to bring hope to their people. I quote from “Time” of November 4, 1940: “In the
course of 75 years, for the price of one U.S. heavy bomber (about $15,000.00), U.S. Protestants have built 13 colleges
in China. Eleven of the 13 colleges have had to leave their pre-war campuses, but not one campus has been
abandoned to the Japanese. Under U.S. and Chinese control, they are being used for relief and reconstruction programs for China's
war-struck millions. Despite their record enrollments in the new scholastic locations, the Christian Colleges have been able to take only
one in five of qualified applicants. But even with makeshift equipment and a great lack of books, all are giving
full courses... If China needs engineers, she asks Hangchow Christian College for them, and gets them.” I am looking forward
to opportunities of knowing you in a personal way so that together we may better bring Christ's message to the
Chinese students. Over $600 has been collected for the gift fund so far, and the rest will be collected as
soon as possible. The number of candidates to be trained is limited. All appointments as officers will be in the
lowest grade in the arm in which school training is given. Candidates will not be limited to men serving in
the arms establishing schools, but will be drawn from all arms and services (less air corps) in approximate proportion to
the strength of the several arms and services to the strength of the army as a whole. When it is
practical, candidates will be permitted to select the arm in which training is desired. Every applicant for training as an
officer candidate must agree to serve one year extended active duty if commissioned in the Officer Reserve Corps upon completion
of the course. Crusty Bachelor: I know something, dear, as you grow older. You'll get over that habit. Never mind,
I shan't tell. Arnold went back home to Greensboro. Pi Kappa Phi Due to the finishing of exams, very few
Pi Kapps were found on the campus last weekend. Charlotte claimed Brothers Geddie, Herring, Morris, and Erskine Parks, while Hickory
beckoned to Brother Paul Bumgarner and pledges Bob Hutchins, Lumbarger, and O. D. Evans. Pledges McAllister, Armstrong, and Rymer made
an extended tour through Mooresville, Statesville, Hickory, Newton, Maiden, Lincolnton, and ended up at Gastonia. Brothers Mobley, Hite, McCall, and
Miller journeyed to their respective homes in Florence, S.C. South Carolina also summoned Brothers Hipp and Plunkett and Pledge Maynard
Watson to their homes in Greenville, Aiken, and Ridge Springs respectively. Pledge Gene Head made a trip to Asheville during
his spare time, and Tommy Lanson managed to take in High Point, Greensboro, and Winston-Salem. Brother Garvey went to Winston-Salem.
Phi Gamma Delta The brothers of Phi Gamma Delta traveled far and wide during the past weekend, celebrating the ending
of examinations and taking one last trip before the start of a new semester. A detachment of five made an
expedition to the city of Lynchburg; included in this group were brothers Frank Barker, Mack Otte, Winston Taylor, Harris Reynolds,
and Pete Cavert. Patton Olivet chose to recuperate and forget the nightmare of exam week via a visit in Richmond.
Chase Brewer retired for a day on so to Charlotte. Raleigh was the weekend destination of Dan Hodges while Shorty
Parrish and Arch Taylor were accompanied on their Winston-Salem pilgrimage by Earle Bellatin. Pledge brother Bob Crowell went to Lexington.
The usual number of Phi Gams did their part toward swelling the weekend crowds in Charlotte and a few chose
to spend a wretched time here on the campus. Phi Delta Theta is announcing that Hank Crane, of the sophomore
class, has been pledged on Gamma Chi. Kappa Alpha The weekend after examinations has always been very popular with the
brothers for wild hares to the far corners of the Sunny South, and this year was certainly no exception. According
to Brother Davis Thamlin, who and three other boys stayed on campus this weekend. Pledge Brothers Burke and Gatling took
an extensive fling through southern North Carolina, touching at the points of Gastonia, Belmont, Charlotte, and Queens. Brothers Sandifer and
Speas did the dramatic and went to their homes in Lowrys, S.C. and Winston-Salem respectively, while Brother Dick Arnold went
back home to Greensboro. Brothers Wallace, Watt, Belk, Coppedge, and McLean spent the time dating and gadding about Charlotte, as

two weeks. Another ail-] Howard Spring, the author of the best seller "My Son, My Son," has returned from a
bout with the flu. Nothing spectacular has happened in the construction, and work will continue steadily until the job is
finished around commencement. The home-made construction of the platform has attracted more attention than anything else. The brothers scattered everywhere
to see if their lateness was excusable. Brother Willard Councill, brother of Pledge George Councill, who comes to us from
Beta Kappa Chapter of Kappa Alpha at the University of Maryland in Baltimore, returned Sunday. Pledges Preyer and Milliken reached
home base in the "Barle" Saturday afternoon and returned Sunday. Pledge Bogh Port struggled on Monday morning on the Dawn
Patrol.

Howard Spring has produced another stirring novel in "Fame is the Spur." Mr. Spring again tells a personal story with
a historical background. The march of fame is the central story in "Fame is the Spur." The brothers met on
the job and are kept busy carting load after load of fresh concrete and throwing hundreds of blocks to be
whisked up to the second floor or roof. Tremendous force motivated his rise to a great place. Mr. Spring depicts
this with the same automatic man with a bull-tongue plow.

Brother Walker spent the past week burning up the road between here and Mt. Gilead. Brother Rankin spent his time
between Charlotte and Mt. Gilead. Due to the fact that exams were over and also that the flu bug took
its toll in our brotherhood, Brother Howell was in Ellerbe, Brother Thompson in High Point, Brother Barnwell between Burlington and
Greensboro, Brother Garrou in Valdese, Brother Spike Mebane in Burlington, Brother Raynor went to Atlanta, Robin Schmitt to Charlotte with
Pledge Tom Welsh, Granny Sharpe to Burlington, and Vereen to Charleston.

Work has been progressing as planned, and college authorities state that the buildings will easily be finished by commencement. The
home-made construction of the platform has attracted more attention than anything else. The buildings will not be occupied until they
are finished.

Brother Shaw went to Fayetteville, Brother Taylor to Charlotte, Pledge White to Graham, Al Winn to Greenville, Pledge Chandler to
Sumter, and the usual crowd to Charlotte including Summerville, Church, Bryant, Baird, McAfee, and Pledges Upchurch, Welsh, and Phillips. Brother
Boykin zipped down to Raleigh and the Phi Delt house dance in Chapel Hill. The remaining sophomores scattered to Charlotte
and other friendless cities. Pledge Fisher went up to St. Mary's, and others to Bryson City, McIver to Bristol, Waldlaw
to Spartanburg, and Pledge Hayes spent his spring vacation prematurely at his home in Lyman, S.C.

On January 19, John Farrior and Tom Brown spoke to the young people of the Second Presbyterian Church in Charlotte
in connection with a series of foreign missions programs which that group has been sponsoring. These programs will be continued
on Feb. 2 and Feb. 9. Paul Crane, John Farrior, and Hank Crane presented a missions program to the young
people of the First Presbyterian Church in Winston-Salem on Sunday, Jan. 26. On Wednesday night, Jan. 29, John Farrior, Sim
Kerr, and Joe Hopper conducted a program on missions at the Myers Park Presbyterian Church in Charlotte.

As soon as exams were over, all the Pikas left, scattering in all directions. Toddy Latimer and Enoch Stevenson were
the most ambitious, making a tour of all the South Carolina chapters.

Charlotte's new Wm. R. Barringer Hotel, 420 N. Tryon St., offers excellent opportunities for interested applicants.

Sigma Phi Epsilon
After a hard fight with examinations, most of the brothers either collapsed into Charlotte or went home in order to
"get away from it all." A notable exception was Queenie Bob Smith who insists he had a complete return to
the SPE house. As for the remaining Sig Eps, they returned to the campus with long tales of exciting weekends
after exams. Brother Bell, accompanied by Dudley and Davis, went to Burlington and Greensboro.
