The election proved a completely unexpected shock and pleasure to Dr. Lingle. When Dr. Lingle resigned, Lingle and the other Center trustees were all set to select a successor. Dr. Lingle had already made up his mind as to his choice and felt certain that his candidate would be accepted. When the committee assembled, Dr. Lingle, as chairman, asked if they were ready to vote. To his astonishment, they replied that a new President had already been chosen and that he was Dr. Lingle!

Although Dr. Lingle’s official connection with the college will be severed, he will continue to serve as the opportunity presents itself. The weekly articles which he has been writing for years will continue.

Other members of the cast will be chosen from student try-outs. Anyone interested in trying out for a part is urged to look over the script of the play, which will be placed on the shelf in the library shortly. New members of the Red and Black Masquers, to be initiated this week, will be announced next week.

Negro School to Have Band

FROSH CAGERS [Continued from Four]
Short along with Reid played best for the Bisons. In the preliminary to the varsity game with N. C. State, the freshmen defeated Salisbury High 38-29. Coach Little substituted freely and the team showed marked improvement. Williams was the high scorer for the frosh with 11 points and Currie turned in their usual good game.

Next, the director of the band will probably be one of two Davidson seniors who are majoring in music. Both the Davidson Music Department and the “Y”, represented by Hall MacLauchlin, are cooperating in the project. The concert, which is in Chambers Auditorium, will be on February 8, at four o'clock.

AMONG THE GREEKS
Dr. Lewis B. Schenck will be the guest minister at Vespers next Sunday night. The substance of his sermon will center around the topic “the God-centered character of religion.” Dr. Schenck was scheduled to speak the night of January 19, but because of the flu epidemic, the date was moved up two weeks. The Davidson professor is the author of the recent book “The Presbyterian Doctrine of Children in the Covenant.”

While at Davidson, Dr. Schenck was an “all-around” man. He was president of the Y, vice-president of the student body, a senior class officer, captain of the basketball team, and editor of the Davidsonian. Upon graduation from Davidson, he studied at Union Seminary, Princeton, and Yale, respectively. In the fall of '27, Dr. Schenck became a member of the faculty of Davidson College.
