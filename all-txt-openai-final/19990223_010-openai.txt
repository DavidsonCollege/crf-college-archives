Trying new things isn’t bad. I need to learn that. My purchase and subsequent enjoyment of the Jewel album helped
to dispel some of my musical fears; nonetheless, I remain apprehensive. I am the guy who orders a #2 value
meal every time he visits McDonald's, a #1 combo at Chick-Fil-A, and Cashew Chicken at every Chinese place — I
like to have regularity in my life. Therefore, despite my successful venture into the unknown, for this edition of my
column I must return to the basics. For now, that means Dosage (Atlantic, 1999), the new record from Collective Soul.

“Shine,” “December,” and “The World I Know” (that deliciously cool chorus that ran through your mind all day in tenth
grade), elevated the band to star status. As a result, they have to play good music now. They can only
mess around with new sounds or ideas to a certain extent. They must “stick with what got them there.” Dosage
is an album produced under that light. It is chock full of simple, catchy tunes that won’t scare fans away.
The only problem is that they probably won’t gain any new ones.

Don’t get me wrong — these Atlanta boys have turned out a fine effort. Surely a few tunes from Dosage
will turn up on their Greatest Hits album in five years or so. I do appreciate the consistency of their
sound. I marvel at the way they make a G-C-D chord progression sound like it was the coolest thing in
music.

Even so, this new record doesn’t really accomplish anything. Maybe it’s that whole fourth album curse. After all, who can
remember a breakout fourth album? Well, maybe Led Zeppelin’s untitled album (commonly called Led Zep IV or Zoso) is an
exception, but most bands hit a rut in the mid-career stage. Collective Soul seems to be caught in one right
now. In several places on the new album, it seems they are really trying to sound good. They no longer
follow where the music leads them. That strained effort makes some songs worse. This effort also makes one or two
other songs just suck. The album does have some redeeming qualities. “Run,” for example, is a great sing-along song, while
“Needs” includes one of Ed Roland’s more impressive vocal performances. However, most of the album sounds dreadfully like a cover
album — a cover, essentially, of themselves.

So I am disappointed by the effort. That’s no big deal. It may be time for Collective Soul to look
in a new direction.

That encourages me. I need to break out of my monotonous existence and venture into undiscovered country. I hear that
Lotus 28 has a great beef dish.
