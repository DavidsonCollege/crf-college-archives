Davidson Outdoors is sponsoring an intensive backcountry medical training course here over Fall Break from October 7 to 10.

DAVIDSON OUTDOORS

The 36-hour Wilderness Advanced First Aid Course will show students how to deal with medical emergencies when they are miles
from help and cannot dial 911. The course will address three fundamental differences between Wilderness Medicine and regular treatment. First,
transport times are measured in hours and days rather than minutes; second, awkward environments increase the complexity of any treatment;
and third, limited equipment makes any situation more difficult to handle.

Professional instructors from Wilderness Medical Associates will teach the four-day course, in which mornings are devoted to lectures and afternoons
and evenings are spent in medical simulations. The course fee is $150 for students, faculty, and staff. For more information,
call Davidson Outdoors at -2623.

The men’s and women’s cross country teams traveled to Greensboro Saturday for the Greensboro Invitational.

Cool temperatures and dry weather plus a fairly fast course made for excellent race conditions as both teams attempted to
improve from their respective performances last weekend at Delaware.

The women got off to a good start with an excellent performance from freshman Suzy Burr. She finished third overall
with a time that was fast enough to set a new school record for the women’s 5 km race. Her
time was 18 minutes 25 seconds, which bettered the old mark by 20 seconds.

The Wildcats got more help from freshmen as four of their five scoring positions were taken by freshmen. Janet Aardema
(20:46) was Davidson’s second runner, followed by senior Katie McKelvie (20:47), and freshmen Kelly Kiefer (21:05) and Beth Brewster (21:27).

Overall, the women’s squad finished seventh out of 13 teams, and coach Bill Drake said he was very pleased with
the Wildcats' performance.

Men’s coach Gary Andrew was equally pleased with his team as it took 10th place at the 18-team event. “This
is our best race to date,” Andrew said. “The guys were more competitive today. People went out and raced.”

Sophomore Josh Cookson led a team which saw six of its nine runners achieve personal bests for an 8 km
course. Cookson placed 14th out of 116 finishers with a time of 26:35. Dave Foss (27:33), Tripp Franklin (27:59), Jonathan
Fly (28:23) and Tim O’Keefe (28:33) rounded out the top five for the Wildcats.

“We raced well as a team today,” Foss said. “If we continue to improve, we will be primed for conference.”

Both teams will be off for fall break weekend. Look for faster times, however, in two weeks when Davidson travels
to Charlotte for the North Carolina Intercollegiate Championships in McAlpine Park on October 14.

Wildcats are disappointed to be 1-3. But things will only get better from here on out, as Davidson has already
faced the two top teams in Emory & Henry and Guilford. The squad improves weekly and has demonstrated it is
capable of competing with the powerhouses on their schedule. The obvious next step for the club is to transform those
close losses into wins, partially by eliminating little, but important, mistakes.

Landis is confident his team will do that, saying, “It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to realize that the future
of football here is very bright.”
