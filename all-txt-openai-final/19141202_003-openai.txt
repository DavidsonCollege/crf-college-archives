BASKET BALL SEASON APPROACHING
The prospects for basket ball this year are exceedingly bright. Coach Fetzer has consented to coach the team, and this
assures a successful season. The remodeling of the gymnasium gives a good court and ample room for consistent practice. Heretofore
the trouble with the team has been the lack of a court and good coach. This year both have been
provided, and there is no reason why Davidson should not have a team to be proud of. From last year’s
squad, McDonald, Reese, Carson, Sommerville, and Laird, are still in college. From the Freshman class, R. Walker made his letter
at Clemson in basket ball last year, and Austin, who attended St. Luke's, New York, made all State prep. With
these men and several other promising Freshmen, Davidson is expecting a good team this year. Manager McDonald is at work
arranging a schedule for next Spring. Davidson ought to have a good basket ball team. This has been her greatest
defect in the athletic line, and a good beginning should be made this year.

SOCIETY CONSTITUTIONS ARE AMENDED
The two literary societies, the Phi, and the Eu., have recently passed amendments to their constitutions requiring every member to
contribute at least one article to the college Magazine during the collegiate year. Each member, however, is permitted to choose
the character of his article, which may be either fiction, poetry, essay, or an historical sketch. In order that the
editor of the Magazine may receive all articles of the year with due regularity, the secretary of each society has
divided all members of his society into classes equal to the number of times the Magazine is issued during the
year.the year, and the members of each class are required to place their articles in the hands of the editor
of the Magazine by the 15th of the month on which their articles are due. Each required article will be
counted as the equivalent of one society credit if the editor of the magazine deems such an article worthy of
a credit.

FOR STATE HIGH SCHOOL CHAMPIONSHIP FOOTBALL CONTEST

Saturday at 3 o'clock the whistle will blow to decide the High School championship of the State, the contestants being
Yonge Huntersville for the east and Asheville for the west. The game promises to be a good one, and a
large crowd is expected. The object in staging the game at Davidson is to look over the material and try
to find some of it for the Red and Black Machine next year. It is the beginning of Davidson's extension
movement in high schools in Western North Carolina. Good officials are promised, and a snappy game expected. The admission will
be only 25 cents. Every single student should do everything he possibly can to give these visitors a royal good
time.

COACH HARRIS DEPARTS

Assistant Football Coach Harris made his departure the latter part of last week. The Alumni Athletic Association were very fortunate
in securing him as assistant coach, for he has made an ideal man for the place. To him, along with
Coach Fetzer, is due in a great measure the success of the season. The two have worked together in perfect
harmony, and have been a pair of coaches that could not be excelled in the South. Harris was a thorough
student of the game. For several years he was coached by Fetzer at Woodberry Forest Prep School and was a
star there. From there he went to U. of Va., where he played great ball for four years, and last
year was an assistant there. He has overabounded in "pep" and life on the field, and has instilled this into
the squad. His untiring services here are deeply appreciated. Those who came to really know him, found in him a
friend whose departure will be keenly felt. He was one of the most congenial, good-natured, and gentlemanly men ever met.
From Davidson he left for his home in Danville, Va., where he leaves immediately to take up a big contract
in civil engineering. Every Davidson man wishes for him the greatest success.
