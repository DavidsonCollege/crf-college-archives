**THE DAVIDSONIAN MONDAY, MARCH 2, 1992**

**Terry Continued from Back Page**

**Terry:** One suggestion has been that we not hitch these two together. We work on the alcohol policy and then we work on the rush policy. They think that solving one problem gets in the way of the other.

**Davidsonian:** Are freshmen not allowed to go to any wet parties the first semester?

**Terry:** That’s what this policy says. The one weekend night was for a dry rush party.

**Davidsonian:** So, essentially freshmen wouldn’t be allowed to drink first semester.

**Terry:** On the court.

**Davidsonian:** Do you have any concerns that if freshmen aren’t allowed to drink in a social situation first term, that we’re going to be a suitcase school?

**Terry:** I hear that all the time and that may be true. That certainly is of concern to me, but the dilemma is do you then encourage their abuse. Their abuse is certainly encouraged now.

**Davidsonian:** It seems like the whole first semester will be spent avoiding the whole problem of letting freshmen drink. It's kind of saying that alcohol is completely off limits to them.

**Terry:** Yes, but the dilemma is how do you do that and make any pretense of abiding by the law. The law is the problem. The law is the fundamental problem. If we didn’t have this law we would not have the problem we have now and if we did have the problem we could solve it without having to take these kinds of measures. It’s the most stupid law that was ever conceived for a college campus and it does not curb abuse, it encourages it.

**Davidsonian:** What were your ideas about rush?

**Terry:** I'd like to see us move toward a dry rush. I would certainly like to shorten rush, and I haven’t found anybody who doesn’t want to do this. The CCRL talked about setting aside a period of rush and making it dry, thereby separating it from this policy of distributing alcohol.

**Davidsonian:** People have suggested shortening rush?

**Terry:** Dozens, and lots of presidents.

**Davidsonian:** Some feel it's an advantage to have a longer rush, have you heard any from this side, because at some schools they have a two-week rush and it's pretty ridiculous.

**Terry:** Oh, yes. I think that’s too short. That’s why I suggested finishing it before Thanksgiving. On the other hand, I do have a problem with freshmen men spending almost six of their eight months dealing with getting in and getting initiated in a fraternity. I think that’s a distorted view of the way to spend your freshman year. So, from my viewpoint what would be ideal to do is to finish it before Thanksgiving so that people could come back and concentrate on exams and so forth. Then, start pledging immediately after they make their grades and get in the fraternity, and have that over by the end of February. So they have March and April and the little bit of time in May to enjoy life and live the normal life of a sophomore, junior, and senior.

**Davidsonian:** Does it concern you that houses may rent more places off campus to have parties on the weekends?

**Terry:** Sure, I would prefer for all houses to have parties on campus. I think that’s safer and it contributes more to community. But, I think that we can’t be held hostage to that. Once again, if we didn’t have that law we wouldn’t have this problem. But we got it so we have to deal with it.

**Davidsonian:** Have you thrown around any numbers for the limits on kegs and the limits on the number of parties per week, that’s left totally wide open.

**Terry:** Nobody has really discussed it. I left it blank for obvious reasons, I wasn’t going to do that by myself.

**Davidsonian:** Why did you decide to keep kegs?

**Terry:** I think you can control things better with kegs, particularly if you control the number of kegs you can control the amount you distribute. I gather that the SigEps have been pretty good at doing that when they buy the cases of beer and distribute them and I really don’t have any problem with that. This is a complete turn-around for me. When we started revising the policy last year, I was so hot for BYOB and the court convinced me that that was not a good idea. From a liability standpoint, and this is why the national fraternities like it, it is a dream. I think that in itself, from a legal standpoint, is not very sound because if you provide the house, the occasion, and the mechanism for allowing beer to betaken, I’m not sure if that house still isn’t liable in some way. But, it’s certainly less liable. Liability is a concern, but that’s not my primary concern. My primary concern is abuse. I think kegs control it more. The Duke experiment is far from perfect, but they find the keg is better than BYOB and they require kegs.

Davidsonian: If abuse is the main priority, couldn’t a lot of the provisions be met by better education at the houses themselves?

Terry: We’ll do a lot of that anyway. As far as I’m concerned if we see that the abuse is being limited without all these nit-picking rules, I'd be perfectly willing to draw back from them. I think the fewer rules you have the better. Look at the present Patterson Court alcohol policy, it’s one rule right after another. Students often are very creative in getting around the policy. There’s nothing new about that. I’m not very sanguine about education as the answer to abuse because I don’t think there are many students who would not know what abuse is and what it isn’t, yet they go on doing it. There are plans to increase the education and that’s in the policy, with both freshmen and upperclassmen.

Davidsonian: Talk about the issue of monitors again.

Terry: I think they need to be designated, with some sort of vest or something like that, so that people will know who they are. So, if somebody needs help they’ll know who to go to. My suspicion is if you were at the KA house and somebody from Sig Ep or Warner Hall needed a monitor for something, they wouldn’t know who the heck the monitor was. Members of the house might, but others wouldn’t. I think they (monitors) need to be designated. They would be the main people to help somebody in trouble and to report violators of the policy.

Davidsonian: Who would handle violations of the alcohol policy?

Terry: There’s the formation of an Alcohol Enforcement Committee to handle such violations, which is described in the policy. I’m not smart enough to be able to deal with all that nor do I have the time to deal with that by myself. The Honor Council certainly can’t handle all of that. We’d have to pay them to meet. I think that will give people a more even-handed approach to it too. That’s not just for the houses, that’s not just for the court, it’s for the residence halls, for somebody drinking in the stadium—any alcohol violation on this campus.

Davidsonian: How long are you going to take suggestions to this policy?

Terry: The CCRL will meet again on March 19. I’d like to have them at least by the 17th so I can correlate them and have them in some manageable form to them. It’s going to take us more than one week to come up with the final draft. The Trustees meet on April 24, and the mailing will probably have to go out by the week of April 13th.

Davidsonian: So, by next fall we will definitely have a new alcohol policy.

Terry: Unless the Trustees say “we don’t want this.”

Davidsonian: Is there anything that we missed that you might want to comment about?

Terry: Students are a part of this process and that is as it must be, but I really do think that our history proves that the Trustees and the Dean’s Office have really tried to make the students responsible for this area of their life, particularly on Patterson Court, with almost no intrusion, except to tell them that they have to have a policy, and it’s my honest opinion that they haven’t done it very responsibly. I think that’s also the Trustees' opinion. There was one Trustee who said we ought to give them the rest of the spring, but the consensus of that meeting was that we have given them two to three years and nothing much has improved, now we’ve got to move on. Students can creatively come up with a sound policy if they are willing to spend the brain power to do it. That’s what I want them to do, but if they can’t do that then we’ll have to move in other directions.
