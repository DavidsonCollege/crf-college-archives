**Glee Concert Feature Of Junior Speaking**

One of the main social events of Junior Speaking will be the Glee Club concert Saturday night at 8 o'clock,
in Shearer Hall. This club has been holding regular practices for the past six weeks, and is now in good
shape. The personnel of the club has been cut down and the finishing touches are now being applied to the
eighteen men selected. The features of Saturday night's entertainment will consist of character sketches and quartet work. The chorus singing
of the club has been stressed more than usual this spring, especially the novelty part. A real treat is in
store along this line. Added to this will be several numbers by the mandolin and guitar trio. The Glee Club
is planning a trip to Charlotte, Red Springs, and Fayetteville for the 12th, 13th, and 14th of March. The details
of this trip have not as yet been worked out. Admission to the concert Saturday night will be 35 cents.

**Final Services of Campaign Successful**

Campus Life Purified and Refreshed as Result of Meeting.

On Tuesday night of last week, after the usual interesting song service, Dr. Myers spoke on “The Sin of Indifference.”
He took as his text the 36th verse of the 27th chapter of Matthew: “And sitting down they watched him
there.” The great sin of the college man is not any wrong deed that he commits. It is the omission
of those duties which he should perform. The most sinful of men is the one who sits on the fence
between right and wrong and does nothing. Though we cannot sit, as the multitudes did, and see our Lord crucified
in the flesh, yet we allow Him to be crucified a thousand times in the spirit. Dr. Myers closed his
sermon with the story of Barabbas, the robber in whose place Christ was put to death. Christ took our place
just as truly as he did that of Barabbas. Shall we remain indifferent to Him?

In the third and last meeting of his campaign, Dr. Myers spoke briefly about some incidents in the life of
Peter and their lessons for Christians of today. He prefaced his remarks with the statement that Peter was probably the
biggest man of the New Testament. Peter was first brought to Jesus by his brother, Andrew. By this one act,
Andrew was the means of saving thousands of souls. Christians of today have the opportunity of doing untold good in
this same way. Again, when the disciples had fished all night and caught nothing, Christ commanded them to cast their
net out into the deep. With Peter as their leader, they did so and the net was filled with fishes.

**Carolina Defeats Wildcats By Big Score**

**DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N. C., MARCH 5, 1919.**

**Dr. Pratt Speaks On Great World Need**

**Passing of Carolina Quint Feature of Game.**

With the state championship at stake, the Davidson basketball quint was defeated by the heavier and more experienced University team
by the score of 40 to 12. The secret of the U.N.C. victory lies in the fact that they passed
rings around Davidson in the first half, and rolled up too large a score to be headed off. Then, too,
the White and Blue were caging the ball accurately from any angle, while their opponents were fumbling and missing even
the easy shots. Time after time, Davidson had the ball right under her own goal, with a clean shot, and
then failed to tally. Long shots also failed to even up the score although these were tried several times by
the Wildcats. The game was fast and free from fouls. No personals were called and only a few technicals, and
these were excusable on the small court. Once Carolina obtained the ball, they passed with speed and soon were in
a position to score, which they nearly always did. Not giving up for an instant, however, the Wildcats put up
a better game than the score might indicate. They played a good defensive game but lacked the attack in their
offensive. Cuthberson, captain and guard for Carolina, played a wonderful game. Holding his forward scoreless, he proceeded to score twelve
points and was high man for the night. Carmichael did not play his usual fast game, being hampered by the
small court, but succeeded in caging four baskets. Schenck, for Davidson, played a hard game, holding his forward to two
field goals. His hard and accurate passing was the only outstanding feature of the Wildcats’ playing.

Carolina, Position, Davidson.

**Twenty Thousand Men of all Professions Needed In Foreign Fields.**

Dr. Chas. H. Pratt, a graduate of Kings College, and later of Princeton, who was a missionary inKorea for four
years, spoke at the regular Sunday evening “Y” service. He was forced to return to this country on account of
ill health, and so, for the past two and a half years he has been connected with the Foreign Board
of the Laymen’s Missionary Movement, with headquarters at Nashville. He has spent most of the time making just such strong
pleas as he made here in behalf of the foreign field. Dr. Pratt spoke of the main issue in our
Christian religion as the idea of service. “The biggest Christian is the one who does the most in serving his
fellow men.” His purpose here, as he expressed it, was to do his ‘bit’ in urging the men with their
strength of body and of mind, as they choose their calling in life, to look broadly and choose that work
that will best serve humanity. He gave us the advice that he had received from the lips of our President,
who was then President of Princeton, which was, “To get a good start in the days of preparation for life's
duties, as does the broad jumper before taking the leap.” Dr. Pratt gave some very striking illustrations of service, and
stressed the point of the great opportunities for service that the war had brought. During the remaining minutes of the
talk, Dr. Pratt made the challenge to all who go out from Davidson, to ask himself the question: “Am I
choosing to go where I am most needed for service?” He showed the crying need for missionaries in foreign fields,
which will amount to 20,000 within the next few years. Men and women are needed not only for religious teaching
but to practice in any profession known in America. The call is strongest for men from the medical profession, which
is so crowded in our country at present, and for men with special training along agricultural lines to teach the
art of scientific farming among these people of the East.

MOVIES BACK AGAIN

Owing to the necessity of securing a fireproof booth, there have been no movies at the “Y” for the past
two weeks. The booth has now arrived and been set up just to the right of the stairs in the
balcony of the new gym. This is a great improvement over the first arrangement, as the light from the machine
will not be seen by the audience. Also, the pictures will be shown against the back wall of the gym,
thus removing the screen from over the basketball court. A person only knows how to appreciate a good thing when
he has to do without it for a while, and we are mighty glad to have the movies back.

No. 18 Mercer University To Be Debated In April

After nearly two months of correspondence with practically all the leading Southern colleges, the matter of an intercollegiate debate has
taken definite form and unless some unexpected factor arises, Davidson will meet Mercer University, at Macon, Ga., in a forensic
contest some time in April. Although the debate has not been definitely settled, yet it has approached the stage that
it can be called a certainty. In view of the coming debate, the Debating Council at a recent meeting set
March 19 as the date for the society preliminaries, at which time three men from each society will be selected
for the final preliminary on March 28. The subject for the semi-finals is, “Resolved, That the proposed League of Nations
should be adopted by the United States.” Every member of the societies is eligible and it is hoped that a
large number will enter the preliminaries. The subject for the finals will be announced next week. The intercollegiate team will
consist of two debaters and an alternate, so if interested get busy and see that you are one of these
three.

Date of Volunteer Conference Is Near

Will Davidson Again Send the Largest Delegation?

In view of information about conflict with Junior Speaking at Davidson, the Student Volunteer Conference has been changed to March
14-16. This is done in the expectation of a record-breaking Davidson delegation, and I know that you won't disappoint us.
— T. D. Rondthaler, Pres.

The above telegram was received from the president of the State Union a few days ago. It shows that the
union is expecting great things of Davidson. They know that Davidson has in past years held the record for the
size of delegation sent to the Student Volunteer Conferences, and they do not expect us to fall down this year.
The committee in charge of the conference has arranged a very interesting program. Mr. Ostrom, a returned missionary from Japan,
will be one of the principal speakers. Mr. Ostrom is closely connected with our church and he is a very
interesting speaker. During the past two years he has been traveling in the South for foreign missions, and has been
very successful in stirring up interest in this great work. The conference will be held at Guilford College, which is
just six miles from Greensboro. Those who went to Elon last year and to Greensboro the year before will remember
how royally they were entertained. Besides this, each one came back with a new vision, because they were thrown with
those who could give information first hand and knew of the actual conditions in the foreign field. The conference is
one week off, March 14, 15, 16. If you are interested (Continued on page 6)
