**Issue demands discussion, not rumour**

The Davidsonian’s focus this week features the Extended Studies Program to change rumors to intelligent discussion. Most students know the
EPC is investigating the Extended Studies Program. The committee has not yet presented their report to the faculty, nor will
they in the January faculty meeting. So the fate of Extended Studies has not been decided; Extended Studies have not
been abolished. We hope Focus provokes discussion by students and faculty so that when the EPC presents their report, they
can form responsible opinions about an issue which affects the quality of Davidson’s educational policy.

**Save your sacrifice**

Rolfe Neill does not know much about sacrifice when he says “I'll keep the $400, but the state shouldn't aid
Davidson.” In his January 9 editorial he says he’d rather see private schools abolished than see an increase in state
aid for them before increasing funding to state schools. His sacrifice is far from noble, nor is it logical. It
costs less to send a student to a public school only to the student, not to the state. The state
pays approximately $2000 for each public school student, $400 for each private school student. If private schools fold, the state
institutions will have to absorb the private school students and increase that $400 to $2000. The sacrifice is not just
monetary. Neill sends his daughter to a private school but does not acknowledge the need for them. Private institutions differ
from public ones only in sponsorship, not in function. In function, private schools and public institutions serve the public need
for a choice in higher education. Small classes, for example, are a choice for which some people opt. Neill calls
them “luxuries”. They are not luxuries. To sacrifice them would uphold the procedure of equalizing on a bad scale. The
sacrifice does not make sense economically; it does not make sense educationally. We’re not willing to accept that sacrifice.

**Social scene stinks**

By CHUCK KENNON
Editorial Columnist

It’s difficult to write about something when you know that what you say will offend about 70 percent of the
reading public here, even when you mean to offend them on purpose. This difficulty is compounded because I know that
most of you out there in Voidland...will pass my words off as the inane product of a demented mind whose
grip on reality is questionable at best. The opinions expressed in editorials written by Editorial Columnists are not necessarily the
opinion of the Editorial staff of The Davidsonian. Instead, they are the opinions of the Columnist only. But I shall
proceed, undaunted by the sneers of the unenlightened masses, aware of all the flaws in my arguments that you will
jump upon, finding much solace in the fact that I shall be gone from here in 16 short weeks. ("Hallelujahs"
ring out from all corners.) To get to the point of all this: The Davidson social scene; four words that
succinctly come to the crux of this place’s problems. Any social matrix is defined by the people contained therein, and
when I view the social game and its players here I have to laugh to keep from crying. It is
a pitiable farce, a joke that could only be perpetrated by a cabal of dirty little old ladies who get
their kicks from others’ frustrations, and the agony will continue as long as each new class looks as if it
collectively stepped from the pages of Seventeen with their "I Found It" signs. Well, they can have it.

The main aspect of this mess is that coeducation, so far as this school is concerned, is a fraud. The
sickening game of "touch-me-not" as played by the perpetual-motion boppers that roam the library, the Union, and other focal points
will last until something approaching a 50-50 ratio is reached. Meanwhile, things are impossible for those who want normal associations
without the pressures that stem from the simple lack of females. As it now stands, the social scene here has
recently crystallized into something so unnatural that it really is evil. The plastic fairy goddesses cruise around amongst their numerous
ardent khaki beaus, existing in a cheery world of hearts, flowers, and group weekends at Sugar. Since those chicks aren’t
for real anyway, the competition for the few normal ones is fierce. This is compounded by the fact that you
can’t help but see repeatedly the same old faces and everyone knows everyone else all too well. Thus several interlocking
problems arise. Most of the students here think alike when they bother to think at all. The gossip is relentless
and reputations are easily made and impossible to live down. Once two people see each other with any frequency at
all, the small minds here will assume they have a "relationship." The thought being father to the deed and peer
pressure being what it is, if things don’t work out for them, others automatically assume something is "wrong" with one
of the two. Statements by very interested bystanders are made, the rumor mill grinds away, and reputations are enhanced or
bruised accordingly. From little incidents are tall tales made, and just plain normal boy-girl encounters become impossible because people’s names
precede them so much on campus. Objectivity is an extinct species. Knowing all of this is true, one becomes really
stifled. The cards are so stacked against a person that the barriers of "What’s the use?" are erected and people
remain in their comfortable if confining small circles. Familiarity breeds contempt, and contempt then spawns rejection. Those raised in the
Davidson of several years ago got the brunt in the campaigns of coping with the even smaller number of coeds
and withdrew from the struggle with a vengeance because it’s been thrown in their faces day in and day out
for too long a time. So now the scene is out of their hands and it has become [see SOCIAL
SCENE, page 15]
