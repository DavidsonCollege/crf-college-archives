DR. CUNNINGHAM ACCEPTS PRESIDENCY

Incoming President Will Succeed Dr. Lingle

Dr. Cunningham's acceptance of the invitation to take on the presidency of the college comes as somewhat of a surprise so early, since it was understood that he would take longer to decide. It is with pleasure that we note his acceptance.

Announced Decision To His Church Officials On Friday Afternoon

WINSTON - SALEM MAN Becomes Twelfth Davidson College President

Dr. John R. Cunningham became the twelfth president of Davidson College on Friday, November 29, when he accepted the invitation of the board of trustees at a meeting of the officials of the First Presbyterian Church at Winston-Salem.

Dr. Cunningham stated that he had been concerned irresistibly drawn to the offer, which was made over a week ago.

John Fredericks makes the Sewanee All-Opponents team, we note in the Sewanee paper. Dave Spencer and Bob Johnson were placed on the second team, with Claude Hackney receiving Honorable Mention. We have been trying to get hold of more of these All-Opponents teams, but haven't succeeded to date.

We certainly noticed no talk making the rounds concerning the Deacons dropping D. C. from their schedule in all sports. Maybe it just makes no difference anyhow.

Those senior blazers have taken long enough to select. Now may we hope they will arrive before our graduation. It would be nice to wear them around school awhile.

The Red and Black Masquers’ play—“Margin for Error”—Should be one of the best presented by them in some time. The play itself is excellent, and the cast has been working tirelessly on its production.

John Snell To Be Sent To College In China

Following the announcement of the 1940 YMCA Gift Fund project made in last week's issue of The Davidsonian, Hank Bahnson, president of the student body, made an appeal to the students and faculty to support this year’s project wholeheartedly in a talk given at last Monday’s chapel exercises.

For their 1940 Gift Fund, the YMCA Cabinet decided unanimously to send John Snell to a college in China within a year. The goal is to raise at least $1,000.

Dr. John R. Cunningham, pastor of the First Presbyterian Church in Winston-Salem, has been chosen as Davidson’s twelfth president. Dr. Cunningham succeeds Dr. Walter L. Lingle, who has served the College in that capacity for the past 11 years. This very important work is the evidence of the will of God in this matter,” Dr. Cunningham said.

Dr. Cunningham did not specify when he would leave Winston-Salem and take charge at Davidson, but it is probable that he will remain in Winston-Salem until the beginning of the new school term in January. He will take a month's vacation before assuming his new office on January 27, 1941.

In his chapel talk, Bahnson reviewed the various phases and aspects of the project, emphasizing the appropriateness and merit thereof. Bahnson also brought out that the cabinet wanted everyone to give as much as he felt like giving, but “not a little gift, a free gift, from the heart.” Ed Watson, president of the YMCA, presided over the exercises and led the chapel in prayer.

Some progress has been made toward collecting the $200 by the men held responsible for the “ravishing” of Eu Hall. These men have been placed in a bad position, and those who helped them that night should feel it their duty to co-operate financially in repayment for damage.

Say, Frosh, as you slyly slipped your caps under your sweater and checked across the campus to the P. O., had you ever thought that our campus is one of the beauty spots of the South, according to Davidson lovers, shaded by the beautiful green of the elms and maples in the summer and carpeted in the winter by Mother Nature's extravaganza of colors?

However, it hasn't always been a spot so pleasing to the optic nerves. In 1861 the condition of the campus became so acute that the students were ashamed to ask their hoop-skirted maidens fair “to the institution of higher learning.”

So in March of that same year, with no other alternative, the executive committee declared a school holiday for the sole purpose of beautifying the campus, each man being responsible for the planting of one tree. The records tell us that many of the men enthusiastically took to the idea, each man naming his tree after his sweetheart. I am told that many of these trees still stand today.

Tuesday, December 10, is the definite date set for the Red and Black Masquers’ first production, “Margin for Error,” a “who-done-it” mystery play. The price of the tickets is twenty-five cents. The play will be presented in Chambers Auditorium at seven-thirty in the evening.

Bill Boyle, YMCA Cabinet member, is general chairman of the gift project. He recently received a letter from Venezuela, where he did missionary work, which stated that nine other missionaries had been chosen to go from there to China. Mr. Snell will visit the Davidson campus soon to address and become acquainted with the student body. He arrived in New York a few days ago from Venezuela.

The Davidson French Club, Le Cercle Francais, will present two one-act plays in French at their next meeting. The plays will be held in the Davidson College French House.
