### AT&T Chairman Assesses Company Breakup
By LEE WHITE

“I think we set as reasonable a course as we could,” AT&T Chairman Charles Brown said. In a speech Monday
night on campus titled “Who Killed Ma Bell, and Why?”, Brown discussed the events leading to the breakup of the
Bell system and their results.

The government sued to dissolve the Bell system monopoly in 1974, Brown said. The company faced years of court litigation,
he said. Meanwhile, competitors were making gains in the Bell System’s markets. Brown said the situation was “doing nothing for
the shareholders or the public.” Brown characterized as “inevitable” a change in the existing situation. Brown said the attitude in
Washington, D.C. favored competition in the telecommunications system. In Brown’s opinion, “Ideology had taken the place of good judgment on
the part of some people.”

Three groups, according to Brown, had different ideas on how best to implement the divestment of the Bell System: the
FCC, the Justice Department, and Congress. The Bell System decided that the best alternative was the Justice Department plan. Brown
said the plan was not perfect, but “at least it was coherent.” By the agreement of Jan. 8, 1982, the
Bell System divested itself of its local operating companies.

Brown said some benefits arose in the new AT&T from the breakup. AT&T was able to preserve the link between
research and development and manufacturing, he said. The decision also released AT&T from some previous restrictions. He said AT&T can
now exploit its own technology. A main concern of the Bell System management, he said, was the strength of the
local Bell operating entities. He said they have proved they can survive in the financial and commercial markets. However, AT&T
and Southern Bell must deal with such regulations as one requiring AT&T to pay twice as much as long-distance competitors
of Southern Bell. In spite of the difficulties, Brown said both sides want to make the new system work.

Brown claimed the benefits of what he termed a “drastic solution” had failed to materialize. He said government procedures have
prevented consumers from receiving the breakup’s benefits. He pointed to problems customers have experienced with repairs and installations. Customers miss
“one-stop shopping” for phone service, according to Brown.

In reflecting on the way public policy decisions involving business are made in this country, Brown said, “We reach conclusions
in this country in strange ways.” He called the idea that the relationship between business and government should be an
antagonistic one “harmful.” He criticized what he sees as judicial decisions with no basis in 20th-century economic reality.

Asked about the future of the telecommunications industry, Brown replied that the industry was one which no one could dominate.
He described AT&T’s market as extremely competitive and worldwide. “AT&T,” he said, “is not looking back. It is a business
involved in the leading edge of information management and movement.”

### Davidson Alumni, Professor Seek Election Nov. 6
By DAVID McGEE

Three candidates who will appear on local election ballots Nov. 6 have connections with Davidson. David Grier (D. G.) Martin
’62, a Democrat, is running for the 9th District Congressional seat, which represents Charlotte and Mecklenburg and surrounding counties. Jim
Martin ’57, who is not related to D. G., is the Republican gubernatorial nominee in North Carolina. Economics professor Randy
Kincaid has his sights set on a seat on the Mecklenburg Board of County Commissioners.

#### D. G. Martin
D. G. Martin is the son of David Grier Martin, Sr., who was president of Davidson from 1958 to 1968.
His mother, Louise Martin, lives in Davidson. He earned an honors degree in history at Davidson, and graduated from Yale
Law School in 1968. Campaigning for the first time for public office, D. G. Martin announced his candidacy last Dec.
7 throughout the 9th District. He is seeking the congressional seat made vacant when Jim Martin, the present 9th District
congressman, decided to run for governor.

D. G. Martin has based his campaign on asking “difficult questions.” He feels that the four biggest problems facing the
country involve “the overwhelming budget deficit, developing effective defense policies, dealing with social issues fairly and equitably, and building a
stronger educational system.” He has proposed a “pay as you go” program to cut waste and inefficiency in government departments.
Concerning the defense policy, he has stated that he would “support any reasonable steps to suspend or moderate the nuclear
arms race.” “I believe in a strong defense,” he said, “but too often we overspend on the wrong projects or
in the wrong places.” He calls for a “partnership between government and the people” as a means of aiding “the
poor, the elderly, the ill, minorities, and the uneducated.”

D. G. Martin describes himself as a problem-solver. He has worked as an attorney with a Charlotte firm for 15
years and has handled clients’ cases in Washington, D.C. with various government agencies, bureaus, and legislative offices. He is married
and has two children. D. G. Martin’s opponent is Republican Alex McMillan.

#### Jim Martin
Jim Martin, a Republican, has served as the 9th District Congressman since 1972, and is challenging Democrat Rufus Edmisten in
the state governor's race. He completed his...Ph.D. in chemistry at Princeton University and taught chemistry here from 1968 until 1972.
He has served on the House of Representatives Committee on Ways and Means and the House Committee on the Budget.
He is married and has three children. On his decision to run for governor, Jim Martin said he and his
supporters “decided the time was right for new leadership in the state government.” His goals as governor include improving education
and the state’s economic climate and reducing illegal drug trafficking. He has devised a merit-pay plan for teachers in the
state’s school system. To enhance the state’s economy, Jim Martin has said he would initiate tax relief to create new
industry and jobs for the state by removing the 3 percent sales tax on food and drugs, and begin a
“staged removal” of the taxes on business inventories, and reduce intangible taxes on savings and assets. He would establish a
public information program on drugs for young people and a drug enforcement agency. In addition, Jim Martin has promised to
accelerate the completion of Interstate 40 to the Wilmington, N.C. seaport and make state government meetings open to the public.
“Public business must be conducted in public.”

Randy Kincaid

Kincaid, a Democrat, has run for public office before, including an unsuccessful bid for the 9th District Congressional seat in
1980. He has taught at Davidson since 1967 and is presently a part-time professor. He owns a plant nursery in
Davidson and has taught in the MBA program at Queens College in Charlotte. He served on the Davidson town board
from 1977 to 1983. Among the issues facing Mecklenburg County this year, he said, are waste disposal, supplements to the
county school system, and reorganization of the county's social services.

Alumni Find A Different Davidson

Fellowship, Overby found it hard to “just fit in” as a team member at Davidson. In Ireland, he saw the
violence between Catholics and Protestants. “There, people die over the issues every day. Here, the most important issue all day
may be deciding how many copies to run of a certain item.” Overby pointed out the tremendous advantage of working
where good facilities are available. “You realize how much the College has to offer. The students are too busy chasing
grades to take advantage of all the extra-curriculars.” Overby said the free facilities at Davidson would cost a lot to
use if he worked somewhere else. He also commented on the warmth of the community here. He said, “After you've
been out in the real world, especially traveling alone, you realize how close the community is. Students take it for
granted that they have close friends who care about them. That’s one reason I came back.” Overby said the administration
here accepts him as an equal. But, adjusting to new relationships was difficult for him because, in some instances, the
student-faculty ties he had developed with certain individuals were very established. Although this aspect of his job bothers him sometimes,
Overby said he was better off than outsiders who come to work here. “Having been a student at Davidson, I
have some direction. I know what the school is about and what its goals are.”

The new technical coordinator of Davidson's Audio Visual department, Anderson Scott '84, elaborated mostly on the difference in his relationship
with faculty. “Professors seem a lot more human. When you're a student they maintain a distance, whether they mean to
or not. A lot of professors are more open,” he said. Scott said as a student he did not notice
too much of the administration and its internal workings. “I was never conscious of politics in the school — the
power structures, who controls what,” he said. “I had never met [Vice-President of Academic Affairs and Dean of Faculty T.
C. Price] Zimmerman until this fall.” On the social life of Davidson, Scott said he was amazed at how much
there is going on here. He said, “I was bored at first. Now I'm looking for stuff to do in
the evenings. There seems to be a lot of social life.” Like Soud and Overby, Scott said he thought the
students were too concerned with grades to appreciate College events. Scott commented on his dual situation of being somewhat of
a student but also a College worker. “It certainly is strange being in between. This is a good job for
a year but I don’t want to remain here. It’s like I'm in limbo,” he said. Scott felt odd about
being thrust into all of the administration functions. As he put it, “Being a half-big brother (to a freshman hall)
is infinitely amusing.” Last of all, Scott said, “I fall out of my chair when people walk in here and
call me ‘Mr. Scott.’”

For Elizabeth Smiley ‘84, the Union operations manager, the realization that the College is a business struck her most. She
said, “When you work here, you see the mechanics behind all that goes on. There are parts of Davidson that,
believe it or not, put the nine to five job before academics.” Of the faculty, Smiley said, “Some haven't treated
me differently from when I was a student, but in general I get respect that students don't. It’s different when
Davidson is paying you to be here than when you pay them to be here.”
