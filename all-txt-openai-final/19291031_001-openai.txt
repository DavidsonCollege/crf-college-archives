#### Former Governor Cameron Morrison To Deliver Address Tomorrow Night At Dedicatory Program in Chambers

**Charles Vardell, Dean of Music at Salem College, to Give Organ Recital**

**MANY ALUMNI EXPECTED**

**Pipe Organ and Piano Gifts of Mrs. Cameron Morrison**

Announcement was made here today that Cameron Morrison, former governor of North Carolina, would make the principal address at Davidson College on the night of November 1, the occasion being the dedicatory exercises for the $20,000 Skinner pipe organ, the gift of Mrs. Cameron Morrison. The former North Carolina executive will formally present the musical equipment of the auditorium on behalf of Mrs. Morrison. Dr. Walter L. Lingle, president of Davidson, will be in charge of the program which will consist of Mr. Morrison’s presentation, an acceptance by the Davidson president, and an organ recital featuring Charles Vardell, dean of music at Salem College, Winston-Salem. Assisting the latter will be Mrs. Emily Cullum, contralto, of Davidson.

It was further made public that the exercises would begin at 7:30, and the entire program would be concluded within two hours. Davidson College students are looking forward to this event, and many visitors are expected to come to Davidson to hear the strains of this instrument. A few had this opportunity at a brief recital on the opening day of the college this fall.

College officials have extended a special invitation to the entire alumni constituency to be present at this event, and those in charge of the date were foresighted in setting the date on November 1, the night preceding the football game between Davidson and V. M. I., where many alumni would be coming to Davidson for this contest. They have been urged, through the channels of the college bulletin, to return earlier than they anticipated, in order to attend the dedicatory exercises.

Mrs. Morrison was the donor of the three-manual Skinner organ, which was specially constructed for the auditorium at Davidson. The organ is equipped with chimes, and is so arranged that the harp may be later attached. In addition to the organ, Mrs. Morrison also gave a handsome piano for use on the stage.

#### Wildkittens to Play State Fresh Friday

Prospects point to a royal battle tomorrow when the Davidson Wildkittens entertain the baby engineers of N. C. State on Richardson field. Both teams point with pride to the fact that neither has been defeated this season. However, the Davidson frosh have a tie with the powerful Oak Ridge cadets as a slight blemish on their record. The State frosh, moreover, will be fighting doubly hard in order to preserve a spotless record.

The power of State is shown by the fact that they downed the fast V. M. I. rat team 19 to 0; at the same time the Davidson first yearmen were running roughshod over the Rutherford College eleven, with an 18-0 score resulting. The State game will be one of the hardest games on the frosh schedule. Fortunately, Coach Laird expects to have all his charges in good shape by Friday, no serious casualties having resulted from last week’s contest, and all men whose scholastic averages prevented them from making the trip last week are eligible for the home engagement.

Under the brilliant leadership of Kavell, the wolflets pushed three touchdowns over on the V. M. I. cadet, with Comiskey, Waddell, and Goodman all doing work worthy of especial mention. When the cadets took possession of the ball, their gains were mediocre for the strong forward wall of the State frosh easily repulsed the attempts of their opponents. Games between the Davidson and State freshmen have nearly always been close and (Continued on page 8)

#### V.M. I. Sends Good Team Against Cats

**Davidson Enters Game Minus Services of Three Varsity Men**

Virginia Military Institute is sending one of the best football teams it has had in several years against Davidson Saturday. The Flying Squadron has defeated Virginia, Maryland, and Citadel, and lost a hard-fought game to Florida by one touchdown. They defeated Citadel 14-7, while the Wildcats won a close victory from the Bulldogs, 7-6. This, by comparative scores, gives the Cadets a slight advantage over the Wildcats Saturday. Last year Davidson was beaten 13-6 at Lexington, Va.

Davidson completed the Wake Forest engagement with several minor injuries, the worst being Mason's twisted ankle, which may keep him on the sidelines Saturday. Brown, regular end, will also be on the bench, suffering from injuries received in the Citadel game. Although the odds seem to be against Davidson, the ’Cats will be fighting to avenge the defeat which was handed them by the Cadets last year. Another factor in favor of Davidson is the fact that they will be playing on Richardson Field before a supporting crowd.

In the last two years V. M. I. has beaten Davidson both games. Before the Homecoming crowd in 1927, the Wildcats were defeated 20-0, in spite of the fact that Davidson made twice as many first downs as V. M. I. The probable starting Davidson line-up follows:

- Left End: Brock (C)
- Left Tackle: Baker
- Left Guard: DeCamp
- Center: Milton
- Right Guard: Mills
- Right Tackle: Baker
- Right End: Proctor
- Quarterback: Fraley
- Left Halfback: Parrish
- Right Halfback: McCall
- Fullback: King

#### Davidson Professors Chosen as Delegates

Dr. Guy R. Vowles, Dr. T. W. Lingle, and Dr. J. M. McConnell have been appointed as delegates to the meeting of the American Association of University Professors at Chapel Hill during the days of December 28-30. The Association meets for the first time in this section of the country, and it is expected that a varied program of educational and entertaining features will be presented to the visiting professors.

Davidson has a chapter of the national organization, and the local group, of which Doctor Vowles is President, endeavors to keep in close touch with all activities of the general program, and to bring these matters up for the interest and consideration of the college faculty.

At the same time at which the Association of Professors gathers at North Carolina University, the American Historical Association will hold its convention at the historic old seat of state learning. Thus with two great conventions going full blast, it is believed that the University will undergo a period of productive activity. Other Davidson professors, in addition to those named, will probably attend the meetings at Chapel Hill.

#### Glasgow Requests That Every Student Think of His Spiritual Condition

**Was Recently Offered Presidency of Assembly Training School Vacated by Lingle**

**EXCELLENT ILLUSTRATIONS**

**Next Considers Spiritual Position of Each Fellowman**

Dr. Sam Glasgow, who was chosen by the Y. M. C. A. of Davidson College to conduct the fall evangelistic services, and who has just been elected to fill the position of President of the Assembly Training School of Richmond, Va., left vacant by Dr. Walter Lingle, delivered the second of his very interesting and profitable series of talks at chapel services at Davidson Monday morning. Taking his text from the ninth verse of the third and fourth chapters of Genesis, Doctor Glasgow based his talk upon the two thoughts: first, Where art thou; and second, Where is thy brother? Punctuating his talk with striking examples and illustrations, he said, in part:

“Where art thou? Where is thy brother? These two thoughts should command the interest of everyone. The answer to the first question depends largely upon the direction and distance we traveled yesterday. We are today at the end of all the journeys we have chosen to travel yesterday.”

Doctor Glasgow showed that it was necessary to check our consciences with the word of God. This he illustrated by showing how the two compasses on a ship must check upon each other so as to get the precise direction. “Not speed, not activity,” continued Doctor Glasgow, “it is direction.” This he illustrated very forcefully by telling about the football game in the Rose Bowl of Pasadena, Cal., in which a California man ran with the ball the wrong way. “He had speed,” said Doctor Glasgow, “but he went in the wrong direction. Where art thou? Is your relationship with God something inherited? Have you ever analyzed it? Is it vital? Is it controlled? It is easy to let moral standards fall, spiritual connection be broken.” This he illustrated by the wreck of the battleship Michigan which was caused by an untrue compass, under the glass of which someone had broken off a knife point. “Where art thou?” Doctor Glasgow asked. “Then,” he continued, “where is thy brother? So God asked Cain after he had slainAbel. Cain dodged the responsibility and answered evasively. The life of every man is affected by the lives of each man with whom he has contact. The leaders in college life influence those who look up to them.” This Doctor Glasgow illustrated very strikingly by the story of an American who, while crossing the International bridge across the Rio Grande, was shot in cold blood by a Mexican guard. The man fell into the river and called to the guard to help him; but the guard only laughed. “This makes us know,” said Doctor Glasgow, “how all around us standards are falling, grips are being lost. We must share in the testings of life. We want to be able, when necessary, to help a brother who is in need, who is slipping. We want to be able to advise and help him.” Illustrating the necessity of this, Doctor Glasgow told the story of a brakeman who had depended upon his lantern to help him in stopping a fast express, only to find that the oil supply in the lamp had given out, thus sending hundreds of souls to destruction. “If we have the life of Christ,” said Doctor Glasgow in conclusion, “when we come into contact with the needs of our brothers, we shall be able to help them.”

Davidson Track Captain Takes Exhibition Event

Between the halves of the Georgia-Carolina game, held in Chapel Hill on October 19, a special track event was staged. In this race, Whittle of Davidson defeated Perry of Carolina in the 120-yard three-foot hurdles. The time was fifteen seconds flat. This event was unique because of the fact that the hurdles, instead of being the regulation height, were three feet. This type is very seldom used by colleges in their track events.

Many Will Participate in Stunt Nite Following Davidson-Carolina Contest On Home-Coming, November 16th

Promise Shown By Davidson Glee Club

Forty Men to Compose the Membership of the Organization

Under the supervision of Director E. J. Cullum, the Davidson College Glee Club has been progressing unusually well, nearly fifty members attending each time. According to C. C. Orr, president, the membership will be cut down to forty for home engagements, and reduced to thirty for trips away from Davidson. “I expect the Glee Club to have a great year, and according to present prospects it will be the best Davidson has had in years,” Orr continued. The Glee Club usually makes two long trips each year, one in the late fall and one in the spring, not including numerous short trips made throughout the school term. The first local appearance will be made very soon. At present, the Glee Club is assisting Dr. Sam Glasgow, of Knoxville, Tennessee, in his daily meetings, in the services sponsored by the local Y. M. C. A.

“In order to enlighten students who know little of the musical personnel of the Glee Club, I wish to say that the programs not only include classical and popular music, but novelty acts and stunts. The organization includes a chorus composed of thirty men, a quartette, a concert orchestra directed by Frank Pilcher, and a jazz orchestra of which A. J. Thompson is director,” President Orr asserted. Other officers of the Club are: J. H. Ramsuer and J. A. Cannon, vice-presidents, and R. W. McDermid, manager. The first appearance of the Glee Club this year was made in Charlotte, Tuesday night, October 22, at which time the local organization gave a concert at Ivey's festival in honor of his employees. R. W. McDermid, manager, who arranges the schedule for the Glee Club, announces that the fall trip will be made around December 1. “We are hoping to appear before several girls' schools in Virginia on this trip, including Sweetbriar, Randolph-Macon, and Hollins,” Manager McDermid explained. “Before going into Virginia, we are planning to give several performances in North Carolina, probably at the Greensboro College for Women, North Carolina College for Women, Salem College, and in Reidsville. “The climax of the trip, we hope, will be our participation in the annual contest of the Southern Association of Glee Clubs of which the Davidson club is a member. This event will be held in Richmond, Virginia, under the auspices of the Richmond-Times Dispatch. “The plans for the spring trip are as yet indefinite, but we are hoping to go into South Carolina and Georgia,” McDermid concluded.

CLASS TRACK MEET PLANNED FOR NOV.

The Inter-class Track Meet of Davidson will be held again this year, probably during the earlier part of November. The meet will be in the charge of Capt. N. G. Prichett, athletic director, and will include all of the regular track events. These will be open to every member of the student body. There will also probably be one or two novice events, open only to those who have never competed in track events. Last year quite a bit of enthusiasm was aroused over the meet. Individual awards were made to the winners of first, second, and third places in the various events. It is possible that this system may be continued. This year’s senior class, which holds the championship from last year, puts in a strong bid for repeating their feat, but each of the other three classes promises to make the winner earn his laurels. More complete plans for the meet will be published in a later issue.

Each Class and Various College Organizations Will Put on an Original Stunt

PROCEEDS TO GO TO “Y”

Varied Entertainment for all is Planned by Y. M. C. A. Cabinet

On the night of November 16, 1929, after the Homecoming game with the University of North Carolina, the student body of Davidson College and its guests will be entertained by various organizations on the campus. “Stunt Night,” as this entertainment is called, will be conducted by the respective classes, the Glee Club, the Symphony Orchestra, the Jazz Orchestra, and any other organization in school, which is not able to perform with any of the classes. Each of the four classes has a stunt of their own, which they will keep a secret until that night. The Glee Club will sing one or two specially selected numbers, probably at the beginning of the program. The Symphony Orchestra, directed by Professor Cullum, will entertain the audience with a few numbers of a classical nature. The Jazz Orchestra will liven up the program with a few snappy numbers, which are to be selected later. There will probably be a solo by a member of the Glee Club or the Symphony Orchestra. If there is any organization in the college, which is not able to perform with any class and which wishes to be put on the program, it may be placed there if those in charge will see Professor Cullum or C. C. Orr. The funds of this performance will go to Y. M. C. A. of Davidson. It will help pay for a piano in “Eu” Hall and for other material that is needed by the “Y.” Much profit is expected to be made from this “Stunt Night.” The majority of the fraternities are giving house parties and the boys are expected to bring their dates to the performance; many old alumni will come back to see their Alma Mater play Carolina and will probably stay for the play. In addition to these, a large attendance is expected from the student body. The “Y” Cabinet and all those taking part in the program are doing their best to afford good entertainment for the night, in order that a large crowd may turn out. All proceeds will go to the “Y” and will be used to furnish the rooms in “Eu” Hall.

O. D. K. Circle to Tap Candidates

As was announced in the last issue of The Davidsonian, Omicron Delta Kappa, Davidson’s National Honorary Fraternity, will hold its Fall Tap Day ceremony next Tuesday morning at the chapel service. Chapel services will be in charge of the members of Delta Circle, the local chapter. A short talk will be made by a faculty member of O. D. K. in which he will explain the purpose of the organization and will give a brief survey of the ideals and history of the fraternity. Zeb V. Long, president of the local circle, will preside. Delta Circle has always stood high in the list of active chapters which cover all sections of the United States. It is the fourth oldest in the national chain. Present members of Delta Circle are: Zeb V. Long, Jr., W. B. McGuire, C. R. Pritchett, F. R. Brown, T. W. Brohard, C. M. Pratt. There are a number of faculty members. Plans have been completed for the exercises Tuesday morning, and there is much interest in the student body as the time draws near when prominent student body leaders will be tapped into the leading honorary fraternity for college men. There is no occasion of the college year which is more eagerly awaited than this Tap Day, and there is no exercise connected with the college which is more significant.
