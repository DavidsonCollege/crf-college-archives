**Understand that Central Americans are people like us**  
*Caroline Craig*

About a month ago, I sat on an airplane next to two Davidson students preparing to return to school after 15 days of travel in three Central American countries. These two on either side of me were the same two with whom I had played paper football on the airplane table tops and made paper games on our flight from Miami to Guatemala two weeks earlier. We had giggled and shared excitement about the coming two weeks. Now we said nothing. We looked over each other out the window. We tried to write in our journals. And we remained engrossed in thoughts, some too scary to say, some too intense to say or write.

My thoughts hedged around this issue of verbalizing the experience I had finished. Would anybody even care about what I had seen in Central America? So many people know something about the area. They read the paper and watch the news on TV. Why should they think I have anything different to say? I hung on to these thoughts for a long time. They were not nearly as unnerving as the alternative scenario. Sometime about the time we flew over Cuba, this alternative scenario hit me. What if they are interested? What if they do ask me questions? What will I tell them? How will I choose which faces, smells, foods, and feelings I will decide to share with them? I had no answers when we got to Charlotte. I just hoped I would have some time before I needed to have answers for people...for myself.

How can I explain what the people in Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica are all about? Little by little, I can try to unfold a little about these people through my experiences and the stories they have shared with me. I was quoted earlier as saying that one can’t think of Central America as a political issue. That was inaccurate. I think most Americans think of Central America as exactly that. My point is that we must learn to think of Central America as an area inhabited by people who are every bit as human as we are. They have children and they desire survival for their children, but their infants die of the common cold. They need food and clean water no less than we do. Their countries have unique histories and experiences. They act in politics, economics, and society. It is some of these people to whom I wish to introduce Americans.

Our group went to a contested area in Guatemala one day. “Contested” means that it is suspected that guerrillas are hiding in the area and the people are constantly fearful of a confrontation with the military. We spoke with a lieutenant on an army base. I’d like to share with you that day’s entry in my journal:

When we walked in the garrison, I was so uncomfortable. Intellectually, I knew that I, being a gringo, would be perfectly safe. Still, I knew that I was looking face to face with a man who was probably involved with the slaughter of Indians, and if he was not personally involved, he works for the arm of government that is involved. There were bunkers, soldiers dressed in fatigues fondling their machine guns. If I’ve never before felt conspicuous, that was the time! Our lieutenant spoke of how there was no violence in the area at all, that this was simply a fabrication of the press. They never engage against the rebels. When we asked why they were there, if not to go against the rebels, we were told the situation was like the United States; just as we have bases all over our country, so have they. We asked him about a death penalty in Guatemala. He swelled his chest and proudly said there was none. “You have such a thing in your country,” he seemed to chide, “but we have no such thing in Guatemala.” We asked him about the ex-president Rios Montt, whose presidency is known for its brutality. He admitted that he had worked for him. He tried to assure us that Rios Montt was not a bad man, and neither is Cerezo, he seemed quick to add. All that the press says is lies, he reiterated. He had a look about him though, a somewhat sadistic grin—a look of “I’m lying to you, and you know it. Furthermore, I know that you know it, so let’s just play our little game.” It made me feel physically ill, just looking at him wondering: How many Indian women have you raped? How many orphaned children have you terrorized? How many children have you tortured? And I sit here basically kissing your feet, phrasing things politely, carefully avoiding any insulting insinuations, and I hate everything that I believe you represent. And my government supports this military. It was a very long hour.

He spoke of the things the military had done to improve life for the Guatemalan people. They have sent teachers out to schools and are working to improve health care, he claimed. I couldn’t decide what made me angrier—the fact that he was lying to me or the fact that I could not make him tell me the truth. And I thought a lot about the woman with us who sat through it all [this woman is an American who lives in the village and teaches the villagers about nutrition], knowing she had to keep on living there. Knowing that at any minute she might get a warning and knowing that some of the people she’d grown to love from her extensive work had been brutally murdered by people this man ate with, slept with, swapped stories with. My God! And America supports this.

Perhaps I have seemed too harsh in my attacks on the military of Guatemala. After all, Guatemala is an ally of the United States, and human rights records report that statistically violations have decreased over the last 10 years. I wish to introduce you to a man who has lived almost 70 years in the village near this military base camp. It was in this village that I learned much about fear. I learned even more about courage, though. This old man spoke to us from a building with...Windows open to the outside where people casually strolled by. He stood near a wide open door, and he unfolded secrets to us which would be lethal to him and See CENTRAL AMERICA, page 11.

Our brilliant student government election system
Glenn Fogle

Spring in Davidson is a lovely time—a time when the flowers are blooming, the birds are singing, and the student body holds their annual farce of electing SGA officials. I remember in my high school years those who were running for SGA had to give a speech in front of the school body and also answer questions about their qualifications and political promises. In my fraternity, we conduct elections under an almost identical procedure: the candidates must give a speech and undergo the interrogation of the skeptical brothers. I am sure this is basically a standard democratic process for electing officials.

Last year when I attended the University of Edinburgh, student elections included public debates and forums which all the candidates were required to attend (that is if they were seriously running). Though holding one of the four offices of the student body was a lot more important at the University of Edinburgh (they were paid and given a year of sabbatical from their course), I do not think it unreasonable to suggest that holding debates and forums for student government offices is the standard procedure for most colleges and universities in the democratic world. It is the best way for voters to find out who the candidates are, what their views are, and to determine who they think is the most capable.

How do you run for a student office at Davidson? Well, you go to the office of the guy with the very shiny head and put your name in a book on the page corresponding to the office you would like to run for. You then create the most ridiculous campaign poster you can think of, complete with an intelligent campaign slogan (i.e. “Yo lads, I’d really priesh some votage”) and plaster them all over campus. The more outrageous the poster and the more it looks like a Patterson Court event, the better, and the more inventive place you put your posters, the better (like taping large amounts of them on the sidewalk leading to Chambers). Of course, you must not forget your campaign paragraph in the college tabloid in which you say something that sounds good though it is not necessarily true (and fervently pray that the paper comes out on time). Then you hope that all the people in your frat/eating house (that is, of course, if you’re part of the Davidson social scene) will vote for you; all the people you know will vote for you; those who liked your ridiculous propaganda littering the campus will vote for you; and all those who did not know who you were but were undecided will vote for you by accident. With a little luck, you will make it through the ten or fifteen run-offs and have a position on a completely worthless SGA, but a juicy bit of info to put on your resumé.

I am not trying to heckle, criticize, or defame the people on the SGA or those who run for the SGA. However, it is ironic that “one of the top liberal arts colleges in the country” as the Davidson brochures boast, should have one of the worst (if not the worst) systems of electing student government officers.

Recycling saves resources and protects the environment
Bill Carrell

Trees live off glucose which they get from photosynthesis. Carbon dioxide is absorbed and oxygen is released as a by-product of this process. A considerable percent of the world’s oxygen supply comes from trees. Unfortunately, however, trees are being rapidly cut down in many parts of the world without being replaced. This destruction is causing less oxygen production and a greater surplus of free carbon dioxide.

Our planet and Venus are very similar in many ways. Both planets have about the same amount of carbon dioxide. Unlike Venus, however, Earth’s carbon dioxide is not free in the atmosphere. It is trapped in various organic matter such as trees. Another difference between the two planets is temperature. Venus has an average temperature of around 900 degrees Celsius mainly due to the greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect is caused by an overabundance of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere which traps any heat that enters.

Until this century, the felling of trees has not posed much of a problem because of the primitive technology and the smaller demand for wood. This century, on the other hand, has created very destructive ways to fell trees; it has also increased demand for wood and farmland (i.e. from land that used to be a forest) due to the terrible overpopulation, especially in the Third World. Most of the world’s great forests have been destroyed. Wood that is cut eventually gets burned, which releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Acid rain and other forms of air pollution kill great numbers of trees and make it near impossible for new trees to be planted in the contaminated areas. The result of this destruction is an increase in the world’s temperature by several degrees due to the excess carbon dioxide.

Conservation efforts in recent decades have been very successful in combating this problem. Unfortunately, their work is only a drop in the bucket compared to what needs to be done. What can be done? Plant trees whenever and wherever you can. Participate in the Environment Week activities in order to become more informed. Spread the news about this problem, and encourage people to give at least a little of their time to help in its solution. Do your best to encourage recycling. More than half of the paper that is thrown away is recyclable. Recycling bins have been set up around campus in the Union and in the Patterson Court houses. Use them! Mecklenburg County is faced with a landfill shortage problem. They are encouraging everyone in the county to try to recycle thirty percent of the garbage which they would normally throw away. Recycling saves a vast amount of resources and thereby protects the environment from further destruction.
