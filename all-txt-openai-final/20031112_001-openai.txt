Poll reveals
importance
of diversity

Partisan rift evident in latest survey results

By Darcie Draudt
Staff Writer

Always a hot topic in the college
arena, a recent Davidson survey re-
vealed the majority of its students
considered diversity “very impor-
tant.”

While students may not talk about
diversity on a day-to-day basis, when
questioned, they expressed views that
varied from disdain for quantitative
diversity to encouragement of it.

The Political Science Public Opin-
ion course polled half the student
body, of which 544 students re-
sponded.

Among other things, the survey
collected opinions on five types of
diversity: geographic, including
states and countries; racial and ethnic
backgrounds; religious traditions; so-
cioeconomic backgrounds; and po-
litical and ideological perspectives.

Students could respond that each
type was “very important,” “some-
what important” or “not at all impor-
tant.”

What the survey says

According to the survey, while di-
versity is important to many students,
the percentage agreeing from cat-
egory to category varies. While the
survey did not ask students to rank the
diversities, certain types received
larger percentages for high impor-
tance than others.

“Often people criticize diversity
without thinking of other types of
diversity,” said political science pro-
fessor Dr. Patrick Sellers, who
teaches the Public Opinion course.
“[The survey] shows that students
don’t think every type of diversity is
created equal.”

For example, the biggest disparity
occurs between religious diversity
and political and ideological diver-
sity: 68 percent of students believe
political and ideological diversity is
“very important,” whereas 47 percent
believe religious diversity to be “very
important.”

This trend surprised McLean
Quinn ’05, co-president of Young
Democrats. “I think of this as an apo-
litical campus. The campus is domi-
nated by religious and cultural orga-
nizations. I always thought politics
was something people didn’t care
about,” Quinn said.

John Pitts ’04, president of College
Republicans, agrees with the senti-
ments expressed by the survey’s re-
sults. The emphasis should be on how
a student thinks, not what quantita-
tive data can be associated with that
student, he said.

“We should be looking for students
on the basis of their intellect, experi-

Trustees voice support for Board’s
Christian membership requirement

By Leslie Hempson
Staff Writer

Members of the Davidson College
Board of Trustees said that a section
of their Bylaws requiring all trustees
to be “active members of a Christian
Church” has served the school well
and indicated there were no current
plans to discuss or alter the require-
ment.

Article I Section 4 of the Bylaws
mandates that all trustees be Chris-
tian, and Article I Section 3 informs
prospective trustees that they will be
asked to affirm their commitment to

improving Davidson’s “effectiveness
as an institution of Christian learn-
ing” at their first Board meeting.

Article IV of the Bylaws reads, “It
is natural and desirable that the edu-
cational service of a church-related
College should be carried forward
from one generation to another by
persons committed to the Christian
faith.”

John Rogers, Jr., a trustee and Se-
nior Minister at Charlotte’s Covenant
Presbyterian Church, said that it is the
Christian orientation of the Board
that permits it to open its arms to
students of all religions.

McGuire urges media,
audience to ‘get radical’

By Matt Bandyk
Staff Writer

Tim McGuire admitted Tuesday
night he was a radical, but not like
you might expect.

The former Minneapolis Star-Tri-
bune editor and visiting James K.
Batten Professor of Public Policy,
delivered the annual Batten lecture in
Tyler-Tallman Hall.

Despite the title of his lecture -
“Tim went to college and became a
radical—Twice” - Tim McGuire said
before the lecture, “I was never a gun-
toting radical by any means.”

He offered his own version: an
“impassioned believer” who has hope
and faith for positive change in favor
of ethics and standards in the news
media.

The lecture’s title comes from
McGuire’s two radicalizing experi-
ences, as he described Tuesday night.

First, while a student at Aquinas

He said, “I happen to think that
Davidson is what it is because of the
Christian faith, not in spite of it. I
think the reason Davidson welcomes
to its student body and to its faculty
those who do not embrace the Christian
faith, I think it’s our Christian values
that allow us to do this.”

Rogers went on to say, “I don’t
think it would help the Board to open
it up to people who aren’t Christians.”

Other trustees expressed no desire
to amend Article I Section 4.
