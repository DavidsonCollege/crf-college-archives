"Davey Spencer, the Barium Springs busy little man who must be considered for anybody’s All-State team, ran all afternoon like a puppet on strings, jerked away from tacklers time and again to furnish the running thrills and ran across three touchdowns."

All-State; Spencer will probably not make it indeed, the odds are very much against it. Lack of publicity and the fact that Davidson does not play high-pressure football would prevent it. Nevertheless, this does not prevent us from giving him credit in our bailiwick as one of the finest backs. Despite his mere 138 pounds.

Recently, there has been talk of the formation of a conference of “smaller schools.” To those of us who don’t mind being blunt, this means a conference made up of schools who give little or no aid to athletes. So far the idea has reached no more than a suggestive stage. Questioned about what he thought of such a conference, Dr. Nince said, “As far as I’m concerned, I am in favor of some physical and academic line forming a conference.” Dr. Nince pointed out at the same time that nothing tangible had been brought forth and that he had given the matter no great thought.

Personally, we would hate to see Davidson withdraw from the Southern Conference. No one can help but admit that Davidson football teams of the last few years have been in the lower strata of the conference. However, in other sports, it has been a different story. The Wildcat cagers of the year before last reached the semifinals of the Tourney. This is but one example of Wildcat accomplishments in other fields.
