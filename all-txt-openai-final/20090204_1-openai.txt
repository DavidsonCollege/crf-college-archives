Davidson’s endowment fell 28 percent from just over $500 million in July 2008 to $362 million at the end of
December. The drop is unsurprising given the rapid deterioration of the stock market in the latter parts of 2008 and
Davidson has fared comparatively well, school officials say.

The school has cut the operating budget by 2.5 percent for the remainder of the fiscal year, which ends in
July, and is targeting a three percent cut for the 2009-2010 fiscal year. Despite budget cuts, the school aims to
protect the current student experience and avoid layoffs, according to President Ross in an interview.

The school’s operating budget relies on several sources of revenue including tuition revenue, room and board charges, and a payout
from the endowment. The yearly payout equals five percent of the endowment’s five-year rolling average. The value of the endowment
on Dec. 31 became the amount averaged for this fiscal year, immediately creating a deficit.

While there was some concern over spring enrollment, and therefore tuition revenue, fewer students have withdrawn compared to recent semesters,
and more students have returned to campus after studying abroad during the fall semester.

President Ross addressed Davidson’s financial position in a Nov. 13 email to members of the Davidson community, reporting losses to
the endowment as well as the school’s plan to weather the economic downturn. “This is a time of real uncertainty,”
Ross said. “We are constantly monitoring and constantly planning for different scenarios.”

Ross hopes to streamline the school’s budget through reductions in non-essential spending, such as faculty travel. The school has also
enacted a hiring freeze, and Ross expects salaries to remain constant in the next fiscal year. “I have two goals
in all this,” he said. “To do everything we can not to damage the student experience and not to lay
people off.”

Endowments at many schools suffered severely as the stock market plummeted. Amherst’s endowment dropped 25 percent from $1.7 billion, and
Harvard lost $8 billion of its endowment which had been $36.9 billion. In addition, many private schools...

**Students face bleak job market**

Despite all of the gloomy reports about the job market these days, there appears to be a silver lining for
college students and recent graduates. The National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) projected, in its Job Outlook 2009 Special
Report, a 1.3 percent increase in job hirings for the class of 2009 relative to the class of 2008.

Unemployment is on the rise nationally. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate in North Carolina rose
from 4.7 to 8.7 percent from Dec. 2007 to Dec. 2008, and the national rate rose to 7.2 percent. “This
is the highest monthly rate for at least the last 16 years,” stated the Jan. 2009 issue of the Parents
Newsletter. The newsletter is produced by the Office of Career Services.

A Jan. 26 New York Times article entitled “Layoffs Spread to More Sectors of the Economy,” reported that many companies,
including such diverse businesses as Home Depot, Microsoft...and Sprint Nextel, “are resorting to mass job cuts.” According to the NACE
report, the majority of industries are projecting a decrease in hiring of the class of 2009. “Only government as a
sector saw a significant increase in hiring expectations, while manufacturing and professional services remain essentially flat,” said the report.

While many companies are laying off many workers, John Adams, the Director of the Office of Career Services, indicated that
he does not know the proportionality of recent college graduate layoffs to other layoffs. “We don’t know which people they’re
laying off,” Adams said.

Other indicators seem to suggest that college students and graduates may have an easier time landing a job than others,
Adams indicated. He said that college graduate unemployment rates are around one-third of the general rate, and that there is
a vast difference between experienced and new hires. Adams said that new hires are typically “less expensive,” making them more
attractive to businesses looking to save money. Also, companies have learned that they have to keep “some people in the
pipeline” of talent, he said.

Adams, however, did indicate some concern about the stability of the job market. Adams shared that companies have announced layoffs
the day before interviewing students for internships here at Davidson, but there is “just a nagging concern that [the job
market] may not sustain itself.” General unease about the market can impact individual job searches, according to Adams. The emotional
impact of the reports, such as the New York Times article mentioned above, can simply sap the motivation to search
for jobs, the reasoning being that the situation is so bad that it doesn’t make any sense to even be
looking for a job. However, Adams stressed the importance of persistence.

Whatever one’s take on current environmental policy is, nations around the world are turning their attention to global energy challenges.
Hoping to bring discussions about this issue to the forefront of Davidson’s international consciousness, the Dean Rusk Program Student Advisory
Committee (SAC) chose “the Global Energy Challenge” as the theme for next year’s Bank of America Lecture Series.

“The mission of the Dean Rusk Bank of America Conference is to expand the Davidson community’s exposure to salient international
issues, to encourage student academic innovation and to forge relationships with peer colleges and universities,” reported Dean Rusk SAC and
Bank of America committee officers Caroline McDermott ’09 and Christoph Pross ’10.

In the spirit of this mission, next year’s lecture series will have a classroom component — in the form of
independent research studies or a seminar on energy resources — so that students can connect the topics of the lectures
to their academics. The topics to be addressed will include “energy security,” “energy in the developing world” and “alternative energy
sources.” The goal of the classroom component is to complement guest speakers’ presentations with student-led research, writing, collaboration with faculty
and presentations. At the end of the 2009-2010 academic year, students whose research yields particularly insightful contributions to the final
multi-day conference and related events will have the opportunity to present their work. This would either be in a formal
symposium or in a more interactive format resembling a Model-U.N. debate forum.

“We want students to start thinking about research topics related to the energy crisis that they’d like to tackle and
to take advantage of the college’s resources, such as Dean Rusk and Abernathy grants, research initiative grants for lab projects
and collaboration with faculty. They could later incorporate summer research into an independent research study to present during the final
conference,” Pross ex-
