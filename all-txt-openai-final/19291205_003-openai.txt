Side Line Shots At How the Wildcat Can Fight
By P. R. Alderman

Davidson 13—Duke 12 sure did end the 1929 season in Wildcat fashion for the Red and Black eleven! Captain Thad Brock played the most spectacular game of his career against Carolina—until he led his eleven against Duke. “Red” Parrish found Sam Buie’s passes more to his liking than those of his teammates, causing three of the Blue Devil’s heaves to go wrong. That Davidson has lost a great lineman in the person of Ledyard DeCamp was proven beyond doubt in the Turkey Day battle. He'll be missed next year. The old pigskin was certainly hard to keep up with the way the Blue Devils and Wildcats handled it—30 to 40 yards a clip was the order of the day. That 44-yard run of Joe McCall through the line for a tally was one of the greatest of his many brilliant dashes this year. Points after touchdowns have been aptly named “Brock” points by a recent writer and no wonder because Thad’s made good 10 out of 14 tries. The Blue Devils exhibited an unusually powerful running attack against the Wildcats, but found the Davidson line too stubborn when the goal was close.

Believe It Or Not—By Ripley: Captain Brock of Davidson runs 102 yards but fails to score—against Duke University November 28, 1929. Sam Buie is one of the greatest passers in the South but needs a couple of receivers that can hang on to his bullet-like shots. Parrish, DeCamp, Brohard, and Mills have played their last game as Seniors for the Wildcats, and how they did it! A big gap was made in the Cat backfield when Walter Fraley went out on account of injuries. In Brewer, the Duke eleven presented one of the hardest-running backs seen on Richardson field in a long time; he just wouldn't stop. As Dr. Lingle said, the Davidson field general gave a wonderful exhibition of Wildcat fight and daring when he elected to take the offensive with the game already “sewed up.” Probably too much so. One of the toughest breaks of the game was early in the first quarter when “Red” Parrish dropped Brock’s perfect pass. It was a sure touchdown, but the little Davidson half made up for its loss and more. Monk and Tex can’t be praised too highly for their work this season. A lot of the spirit and fight of the Wildcats was inspired by these two great mentors. The season is over, but will never be forgotten by those who witnessed the Davidson eleven come through time and time again with a great spirit of determination and fight! Hats off to Monk and Tex and their Warriors!

APPLEBY GIVES TALK
(Continued from page 1)

Eighty-five per cent of all the crimes committed in New York County last year were by boys under twenty-one years of age. “These and other conditions show the great need for the gospel of Jesus Christ. They are a challenge to a big job and a great service. Napoleon, exiled on Elba, asked one of his companions the question, ‘Who is Jesus Christ?’ And when no answer was forthcoming he replied, ‘Alexander was a great man, a great military leader, and the founder of a magnificent empire. So were Julius Caesar and Charlemagne, but their empires were founded on force and crumbled away. But Christ founded his on love and it will remain forever.’ Julian, the Roman emperor who was so cruel in persecuting the Christians, as he lay dying on the battlefield said, ‘O Galilean, Thou hast conquered.’

“But we can’t have a golden society among men with leaden instincts. Here is the challenge again. Only the gospel of Christ can change the minds and hearts of men. “Then there is sheer joy in the ministry. Many people think that the ministry is a long-faced gloomy profession, but it is really one of the most cheerful callings there is. There are many things that give it this satisfaction. The great need, the bigness of the task, the power of the message, and the many friendships formed in it all add to its joy. It is a challenge to real red-blooded men to undertake a job big in every sense of the word.
