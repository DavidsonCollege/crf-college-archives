THE DAVIDSONIAN, MAY 28, 1920.

WHO’S WHO ON THIS YEAR’S WILDCAT NINE

F. W. Hengeveld
Coach

The Davidson Student Body was indeed joyful when it became known that “Dutch,” former star twirler, would coach baseball. Being a recent alumnus and exercising the ideals for which it stands, “Dutch” put out a scrapping team this year. With that everlasting drive mixed in with his pleasing personality, “Coach” turned out a team that would fight for him to the last ditch. It is with keen anticipation that we look for him back next year when basketball and baseball seasons roll around.

Augustus London Foscue
Manager

“Fos” planned a dandy schedule for the team this year. The leading colleges and universities in the South were met. One feature about the schedule was the fact that more games were played on the Hill. This always increases the interest and backing of the student body. The N. C. trip of six days and the Georgia trip of five days, gave the team a pleasant reward for their services rendered the college. Foscue leaves our midst this year and here’s wishing him success.

John Gardiner Richards
Center Field

“Jonnie” hails from the prospering town of Liberty Hill, S.C. He has romped around in the outer gardens successfully for the past three years, reflecting much credit on himself and the Wildcat teams. His fielding averages this year were perfect, the lad from the Palmetto state accepting 20 chances without a blunder. He began the season hitting like a demon, but fell in a bad slump on the Southern trip; nevertheless, his terrific wallops have broken up not a few games. It is with much regret that we lose “Jonnie” and here’s wishing him the success that he has attained as a Red and Black diamond artist.

Edward Erwin Ratchford
Second Base

“E. E.” has covered the midway sack on Wildcat nines for the past three years. After his failure to return in the Fall, much gossip was heard in the Red and Black baseball circles as to who would hold down the second hassock. This was joyfully dismissed when the veteran of two seasons reported in the Spring. “Ratch” has handled himself in good style at second and has wielded the old slapstick for an average of .213 this year. The appreciation of the student body follows him for the valuable services he has rendered, and wishes him the best of success in anything that he may attempt.

McArn
First Base

As the bleachers will have it, “Caruso” has sung first base for the Wildcat nines for the past two years. To let the pill amble down the first base line is to chalk up another out, as “Dug” is death on pick-ups. He leads the infield with only seven errors in 165 chances for an average of .959. Many are the times he has picked up almost impossible throws and retired the opposing side when a score seemed unavoidable. His departure this year will make another breach in the Wildcat defense, but we wish him as much fortune in picking up the old “simoleons” as he had in baseball.

Armond London Currie
Pitcher

“Buck,” this year’s Captain and mound artist, has performed on the team for a trio of years. The “Big Boy” had a splendid season this year, winning five of seven games which he twirled. His change of pace completely baffled the opposing batters and 52 were retired via the strike-out route, giving him an average of more than 7 per game. “Buck” handled himself with the ease of Pavlova this year, only one error being chalked up against him. He will be back into the fold next year and ready to assume his portion of the work on the slab.

William Henry Miley
Pitcher

“Bill” has been shoving the apple across the pan for the honor of Davidson ever since his Fresh year. During his second year, his arm went back on him, but this year found him in prime condition. He won two and lost two, one of these being against Georgia Tech. The “Smiling Shipbuilder” made a name for himself when he twirled a no-hit contest against Elon. Only 27 batters faced him. Besides having a good year on the mound, “Bill” wielded the willow for an average of .231. He will be back next year to assume his regular duties and will participate in the role of Captain.

Jacob Erisman Cassell
Third Base

“Vernon” has romped around the third hassock for the past three years. He leads the infield with only seven errors in 165 chances for an average of .959. Many are the times he has picked up almost impossible throws and retired the opposing side when a score seemed unavoidable. His departure this year will make another breach in the Wildcat defense, but we wish him as much fortune in picking up the old “simoleons” as he had in baseball.

Fielding Averages
-| credit. (Continued from column 2) average of 301. He is tied to second in scoring honors with 10 to his credit. He will be back next year and third base will be assured of its boss.

Violas Diana Johnson
Catcher D*
We don’t know where he derived his nomenclature from, but “Cop” is what he goes by and be it known to you that Cop is one of the backstops on the team. This blond youth broke into the limelight during his Soph year, holding down his position alone for the whole year. This year he has been laid up on account of sickness during the greater part and has participated in only three games, having a perfect fielding average to his credit. This young gentleman, better known as the “Human Chatter-box” will be back to contend for the position behind the plate.

Simeon Mayo Wrenn
Catcher D
Backed by service as former Oak Ridge backstop, and later as catching on A. E. F. teams Wrenn came to us as somewhat of a dark-horse. While on the field this diamond artist puts everything into the game, and used a great deal of judgment in sizing opposing batters up. He works his pitcher with uncanny skill, and when all is said, pro and con, Wrenn is as good a backstop as has been encountered this year by Wildcat teams.

Norman Westbrook Shepard
Pitcher and Outfielder D
Undoubtedly the “find” of the season, as the baseball circles at Davidson will have it. Coming to us entirely unknown, this Wilmington lad has won a warm place in the hearts of the student body for his services on the team. As a pitcher “Shep” twirled the majority of our heavy games this year and only won one of the five he twirled. He hit the sphere for an average of .272 including four doubles. He leads the team in runs scored with 13 to his credit. With better support next year, “Shep” will enjoy a banner season.

Friel Montgomery Cassell
Shortstop
“Frog”—as the midget lad from the state of presidents is known by—put up a dandy brand of the national pastime at short, but was laid up when the season was half over with the mumps. His loss was severely felt as he gathered in everything that came his way while performing in his position. This former A. E. F. man was no slouch at the bat either, wielding old betsy for an average of .222. With better luck next year, “Frog” will be a valuable asset to the club.

H. R. Huffstetler
Shortstop -. D
“Huff” put up a good game at short this year and handled himself with much grace. He only participated in seven games, but showed that he has the goods and with more experience under “Dutch’s” coaching, he will make a valuable man.

Oren E. Poe
Right Field
Reminding us very forcefully of the mysterious “Edgar Allen” narratives, this young lad who claims the same surname, blew into our midst just before the season opened and proceeded to land a berth on the team. After an investigation however, the faculty ruled him out and prevented him from winning his letter. Poe participated in five games, hitting the pill for an average of .263 and fielding .100. Better luck next year old lad.
