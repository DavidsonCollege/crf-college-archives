Honor System Change?-Smyth

“I am more interested in discussion of the problem than pushing it through,” answered Student Body President Ross Smyth in
a DAVIDSONIAN press conference Wednesday. He was referring to his campaign speech of last spring when he spoke of modifications
in the Honor System. He proposed two things at that time: (1) Re-examine and re-evaluate the system to see if
it needs any changes, and (2) Modify the penalty for honor violations to a suspension penalty with the possibility of
readmittance to Davidson. Smyth stated that a committee was formed last spring to study the problem, but that this committee
hasn't met yet this year. He personally hopes for a Ballroom discussion on the matter and does not intend to
push for honor policy revisions this year. “There are many points, pro and con.”

Q. “Do you feel committed to make a stand?”
A. “We can’t spend too much time discussing the issue.”

Smyth again asserted his feeling that any change must come as the result of extensive discussion of the matter.

Q. “Do you feel that your election was a mandate for this change? Is this the main reason you won?”
A. “Many people told me that they were behind me, but they did not vote for me specifically on this.”

Q. “Do you feel obligated to make a definite proposal to the Council?”
A. “Definitely.”

Q. “When?”
A. “We must determine the techniques and discuss the matter.”

Q. “When do you plan to take definite action on it?”
A. “We plan to talk about it Monday night. (The next Council meeting.)”

ROSS SMYTH

PURPOSE OF AMENDMENT

When queried as to the purpose of the amendment Smyth said that permanent dismissal from Davidson means that a boy
cannot get into any other reputable school in the country probably. This would deny the boy a chance for a
good education.

Q. “How would the suspension work?”
A. The boy should be able to come back to Davidson after a suspension period of a year, or perhaps
two years. Allowing for readmittance at Davidson would make him eligible for admittance to other schools also. “It has been
done,” he added.

Q. “Do you think the Student Council will pass your amendment?”
A. “I can't say now. I’m not sure.”

Phi Beta Gives Advice To Future Candidates

By PETE KELLOGG
Davidsonian Feature Writer

How can I make Phi Beta Kappa? This article does not guarantee results, but here is the advice of those
who have already done it and a little about what they had to do it with. At Davidson these select
few are generally pre-med, have public high school educations, and at least one parent in one of the professions, usually
medicine. About I.Q., we don't know. One of the scholars quoted Chalmers Davidson’s remark about the records of Phi Bet
alumni. “If you had it then, you've got it now.”

DON'T BE SQUARE

Suppose I’ve got enough to get by on; how do I get Phi Bet grades? The most general advice is
to use time wisely and effectively. The big problem seems to be striking to the best advantage that fine balance
between extra-curricular activities and study. None of the Phi Bets interviewed recommended devoting full time to studying. They had all
managed to balance their time well and participate fully in extra activities. Nonetheless, one man emphasized the necessity of being
willing to sit down and work regularly. It was pointed out that many things, such as some extra activities and
dating, have to be sacrificed to study.

SIX HOURS A DAY

All the men interviewed spent more time studying their freshman year than their senior year, and noted a direct correspondence
between study time and grades. They averaged almost six hours a day their freshman year, about three now. Take hope
freshmen! One interesting comment made was that if professors would plan their courses for the genuinely interested student, the student
would be more likely to excel.

6 Tapped At ODK Ceremony

Sam Sloan Elected Junior Class Veep

Sam Sloan, a Business major from Gastonia, N. C., was elected Vice-President of the junior class on the fifth ballot
after an extremely close race with Vernon Anderson of Union, S. C. Sam replaces Tom Johnson who vacated this office
when he did not return to the campus this fall. He is a member of the golf team, the Y.M.C.A.,
the D Club, and the Beaver Club. He is Rush Chairman of Kappa Sigma Fraternity and held the office of
Scribe in that fraternity.

Willie Thompson Elected President

The Classical Club had its initial session this semester on Monday evening, November 11, in the Green Room of the
College Union. Dr. George Labban, faculty adviser for the group, presided until the new officers were elected. Because the closing
meeting of last semester was devoted to a Roman banquet, the officers were not elected until this meeting. They are:
President, Willie Thompson; Vice-President, Carter Daniel; Secretary, Bob Groome; Treasurer, Dewitt Roper; Sergeant-at-Arms, Edward Wilson. These officers are selected from
members of Eta Sigma Phi, national honorary fraternity recognizing excellence in the classical languages. Dr. Labban and President Thompson discussed
with the group the nature of the organization and the plans for the year. The members voted to extend membership
in the Classical Club to all those students who are interested in Graeco-Roman civilization, rather than have a classical language
requirement. Membership in Eta Sigma Phi, however, will remain contingent upon demonstrated ability in either Greek or Latin.

Archie Speaks On Leadership Qualities

By BRUCE BROOKS
Davidsonian News Editor

At its semi-annual tapping ceremony during chapel Tuesday, the Delta Circle of Omicron Delta Kappa inducted six seniors into its
ranks. New members are Dave Fagg, Phil Lewis, Gary Maynard, Bill Pomeroy, Charles Stowe, and Gerald Wilson. Bill Bondurant, president
of ODK, presided at the ceremony and John Trask gave a short devotional. John Bernhardt introduced the speaker, Dr. William
C. Archie, Dean of Wake Forest College. Dean Archie spoke on leadership and the qualities necessary to become a leader.
He stressed that a person must be ambitious, opportunistic, and willing to take responsibility, also possessing a reasonable amount of
intelligence.

Other active members taking part in the ceremony were Lloyd Chapin, Ross Smyth, and Dave Bradford. Faculty active members of
ODK are F. W. Johnson, D. G. Martin, C. Shaw Smith, and W. G. McGavock.

DAVE FAGG is co-captain of the football team and president of Phi Gamma Delta Fraternity.

PHIL LEWIS was judge of the Freshman Court of Control and is a member of Phi Delta Theta. He was
chairman of Davidson's delegation to the State Student Legislature last week.

GARY MAYNARD is president of the Business-Economics Association and also president of Kappa Alpha Fraternity and a member of the
Student Council.

CHARLES STOWE is president of the International Relations Club and a member of the Student Council.

GERALD WILSON is president of the Y.M.C.A. and a member of the Student Council.

Studies Resolutions

Resolutions for voluntary attendance of the complete vespers service were presented by the Student Council at its last meeting. The
Council voted to table the resolutions until the next meeting. The resolutions were presented by the Religious Life Committee and
were discussed at length before being tabled. The Council also discussed the possibility of having a student representative on the
Board of Trustees. This proposal was also tabled for further discussion.

Court Construction Shows Advancement

By MICKEY THROWER
Davidsonian Reporter

The construction on the Patterson Memorial Fraternity Court is progressing on schedule, according to Mr. D. Grier Martin. The main
water line has been laid through the court. The fire plugs have been installed and also the main sewer lines.
The installation of underground water, gas, electric, and telephone lines to the individual houses will be accomplished in the near
future.

ECONOMY MEASURE

As an economy measure, no additional funds will be allocated for the construction of the fraternity houses. The funds already
allocated will be used to complete the construction. The stairs leading from the main floor to the basement of the
houses will be finished with hardwood treads and railings, and the walls beside the stairs will be paneled. The basement

were taken up accordingly. The content of this resolution was not. Lewis, who was elected president of the Senate for
one of the meetings, was presiding and was ineligible to vote on this question. Representative McAlister voted for the resolution,
while Representatives Reynolds and Lane served; receive approximately 414-55 thirty years as president of interest on all funds over those
provided by Dr. W. S. Patterson. There will be a fireplace in the living rooms, as well as a smaller
one in the basements. A contractor is being used for the project. Mr. Floyd Ballard has been employed by the
college to supervise the building. The builders are taking advantage of every opportunity to build much more cheaply than comparable
systems in this part of the country.

As a result, the court will be providing additional parking areas. The roads are being widened, and parking areas are
being provided in the center of the court where houses cannot be built because of overhead power lines. These savings
will be reflected in the rent charges, which will be assessed to each fraternity on the basis of its membership.
The cost of the fraternity court will be loaned by the endowment fund. The fund will receive interest on the
money loaned, but this money could easily be invested elsewhere.

A target date of August 15, 1958, has been set for the completion of the court. As soon as each
house is completed, the individual fraternities may begin decorating. Each fraternity will be permitted to move mirrors, wall-to-wall carpeting, paneling,
and other interior fixtures to be used in the new house, provided walls or floors are restored to their original
condition. The new court is expected to be in use at the beginning of the 1958-59 school year.

It’s quite hard to put into a few words one’s impressions of the Big City. Immediately, one sees the faces
of the people. They are not the faces that we are used to seeing, for they reflect the diverse backgrounds
of the people. The tang of foreign language is in the air. But one thinks that this is a real
lesson in what an American is. Sure, it sounds like a history book to note the realization that this is
a diverse country, but meeting it for the first time brings the fact home in a way that can come
only once.

The buildings must be mentioned. They seem to be continuous. The cement and stone are always with you, and once
in a while, one thinks they are laughing at mere people because they continue to exist seemingly regardless of time,
while the humans who built and use them pass from the stage of the city in what must seem to
them a quite brief moment.

The people, the buildings, the language, all swirl into a thing which seems to have shallow roots when compared to
our life, but one realizes that, shallow or not, these, even more than ours, are the roots of America.

Several impressions were gathered from conversations with cabbies. Their unanimity of opinion was remarkable. To the question, “What do you
think of Mayor Wagner (Democrat reelected just last week)?,” one taxi driver replied in the typical grating voice: “The way

Among the items singled out by Keithly were the extensive use of student supply sergeants and the practical experience they
gained in such logistic work. Major Oliver, also a member of the inspection team, was complimentary of the method for
checking out weapons, a method which is handled by cadet sergeants. By comparison, he pointed out that the system of
some schools using cadre personnel for the same purpose consumes as much as 40 minutes of drill time.

Edward Payne, the public information officer, John Johnson, the operations officer, Gary Maynard, and the logistics officer, Ken Forester. Each
of the cadets gave a four-minute talk on his phase of the regiment's functioning. Col. Keithly noted with praise that
no other ROTC unit in the N.C. Military District is run by the cadets to as great an extent. A
noon luncheon was held in the Student Union with cadets Stowe and Smyth, Col. Keithly, C. Shaw Smith, and Col.
Adams attending.

During the stay, which extended from nine in the morning until three in the afternoon, the team also inspected all
of the unit's physical facilities and attended two classroom instruction periods. Also comprising the team were two enlisted men who
checked all of the administrative and supply records.

Davidson’s delegation submitted a joint resolution providing for the establishment of a Federal Science Academy. This was passed by acclamation
of both Houses. Another controversial bill proposed was that introduced by the delegation from Duke's Woman's College. It was a
resolution calling upon all states which have laws or constitutional provisions preventing intermarriage of the races to repeal them. This
measure was passed strongly by both Houses, although Davidson’s voting delegation was split evenly.

Many interesting matters were discussed before the House, some of which attracted national attention. Perhaps the most controversial bill proposed
was that concerning the legalization of prostitution in North Carolina. Senator Lewis had the following statement to make on this
question: “Reports of the passage of a bill legalizing prostitution in the state of North Carolina are untrue. A bill
of this nature was introduced in the House purely for debate in a blank period in the agenda and never
came to a vote.”

Other bills of note that came (Continued on Back Page)
