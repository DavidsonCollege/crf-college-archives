**Vagt, students recall unpleasant encounters with renegade skunks**

Davidson skunks enjoy quite a nightlife. Last week, several PiKA brothers encountered two skunks strolling through the inside of their house, munching on popcorn that had been left on the floor. Workers at the Knobloch Campus Center construction site often arrive in the morning to find a skunk or two trapped within the building’s walls. RLO Director Kurt Holmes routinely reports many sightings around West Hall and near the storm drains in the courtyard between Watts, Belk, and Cannon Halls. Skunks are everywhere.

The furry, black and white critters gravitate towards open garbage, especially around the senior apartments and on the porches of eating houses and fraternities. Most skunks concern themselves more with searching for munchies than with antagonizing people, but college president Bobby Vagt and others have encountered renegade skunks that weren't so harmless.

“I was walking our daughter’s black lab about a year ago when (the lab) took off. When the retractable leash got to the end of its tether, I was yanked along,” he remembers. “I ran to determine at what he was barking furiously, and it was one of these sweet creatures, who before I could pull the dog out of harm’s way, unleashed a full dose on the two of us.”

“The wonders of tomato juice,” Vagt recalls. “It is the only sure remedy.”

Junior Reggie McKoy feels the president’s pain. On his way to the Akers apartments, he nearly tripped one of the black creatures. After giving only a squeal for warning, the skunk doomed Reggie to several friendless days.

**Rise in average GPA catches Ross’s attention**  
Dean says grade inflation would cheapen Davidson education

Earning a high grade in any Davidson course is always an uphill battle, but an increasing number of students are finding success. Two years ago the average cumulative grade point average was 3.087; by the spring of this year, it had risen to 3.218. The increase is a pleasant improvement for many students, but it implies a potential problem for some college administrators.

“It might indicate grade inflation which can erode the value of a Davidson education,” said Dr. Clark Ross, Vice President of Academic Affairs and Dean of Faculty. Ross addressed the increase in last week’s faculty meeting. Clark also spoke on other issues such as the importance of professors making themselves accessible to students and beginning and ending class on time. But concerning the GPA increase, he urged the faculty to make sure their grading standards were consistent with those of other departments.

The average Davidson GPA fluctuates from year to year and usually remains between a 3.0 and 3.1, said Ross. But last spring it reached an uncharacteristically high average of 3.218. While grade inflation, which occurs when a student’s grade is disproportionate to the quality of his or her work, could be the culprit, Ross pointed out that there are numerous other possibilities, including better student performance, more students enrolling in upper-level classes (which generally produces higher grades), or simply an unexplainable aberration from normal fluctuation.

Cross Country off to a running startMany professors suggest that higher grades are not attributable to a single source. Dr. Robert Whitton has noticed grades in his Calculus I class improve over the last few years and suggests the increase is due partially to more and more students having studied calculus in high school. Grades rose in the political science department last year as well, possibly due to a high number of visiting professors. “Visitors, for all sorts of reasons, generally tend to grade higher than regular faculty,” said Dr. Brian Shaw of the political science department. While these high GPAs are unusual, Dr. Ross stressed that professors are not being asked to lower grades in any way. Instead, he is encouraging them to “reflect on whether their grading practices are consonant with a rigorous classroom experience.” He also suggests that professors within each department discuss ways to ensure that grades are similar for the same classes, even when the classes have different professors. Assessing the consistency and accuracy of grades is designed to help the students, says Ross. “[Grades] recognize the real achiever and motivate someone who may not be [achieving]. Giving all an A hurts the good students. How does he or she show that he or she is worthy of medical school or a good job?” he said. Grade inflation, while providing students with better grade point averages, would ultimately cheapen their Davidson experience, he suggested. English professor Randy Nelson says it’s an issue the school can’t afford to overlook.

Edelman to rally support for children in campus visit
By Matt Garfield, News Editor

One of the nation’s most respected social activists will visit Davidson Friday to speak on the issue that’s made her famous. Marian Wright Edelman, founder and president of the Children’s Defense Fund (CDF) and arguably the most recognized advocate of children’s rights in the U.S., will address about 100 college administrators, students, and service agency leaders as part of a conference aimed at motivating college students and community leaders to help children in need. Edelman will deliver the opening and closing addresses of the one-day conference in the Chambers gallery. “She brings a lifetime of experience and a real passion for living your values,” said Ruth Pittard, director of community service at Davidson. “I think she’s about as good a role model as you can have.” Students from Davidson, Duke, North Carolina, and Wofford will be among those attending six workshops designed to inform community leaders about the CDF’s various programs. Edelman’s staff will lead the workshops.

Four Davidson students attended similar events this past summer at the Alex Haley Farm in Tennessee. Senior Allen Lee said the experience reinvigorated his long-time commitment to child advocacy. “At times I’ve had problems maintaining my idealism. People tell me to grow up and get my head out of the clouds,” he said. “But meeting Ms. Edelman there and learning how she came from rural South Carolina to found this nationwide child advocacy movement made me realize that the sky really is the limit if you go hard at your dreams.” Pittard says the event will be an opportunity for people of all ages and backgrounds to learn ways to help children. “My dream is that everyone will begin spreading this information on child advocacy to their respective groups, from students in higher education to local social service agencies,” she said. “Because the whole CDF agenda is available, we can choose which best matches our organizations, and end up working together.”
