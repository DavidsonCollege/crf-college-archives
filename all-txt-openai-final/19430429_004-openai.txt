LETTERS

The Lounges

Brothers Washburn and R. Dunn and Pledge Brother Monroe represented the chapter at the track meet held Saturday at Carolina. Brothers Royster, Daniel, and Richeson attended the latter part of the meeting on their way to Wright, Copland, Taylor Represent Fifteen New Grey Library Books

About fifteen new books have been recently added to the library. Among them are: A Study of War by Quincy Wright; Our New Music by Aaron Copland; and Chicken Every Sunday by Rosemary Taylor.

A Study of War was begun shortly after World War I and was completed in the midst of the present war. It attempts to cope with this problem by understanding the part war has played in the life of man since earliest times.

Chicken Every Sunday is a story about a boarding house. Mother’s day, but of more interest is the boarders themselves. Some of them were strange characters. There were the Wooleys who knew that Providence had sent the skunk to hide under the house because the family didn’t go to church on Sunday; Miss Sally who loved Miss Sally spent all of her time cold creaming herself; and the Lathams who wanted to buy a gold mine.

Our New Music

Many music lovers feel that they cannot appreciate modern music, and even those who listen to it often find it difficult to evaluate. Is it always complex and formidable? Aaron Copland attempts to answer this and other questions in Our New Music.

Science, Religion

Nobel Prize Winner Speaks to Students, Cadets, Townspeople

On April 27, Dr. Millikan delivered a lecture on science and religion, and divided his address into three sections, namely: the fact of war, the influence of science on contemporary life, and the place of the church and religion in the world.

According to the speaker, the best situation for progressive peaceful living is that state wherein government is a matter of self-government, for internal control, and a federation of states for protection against external forces.

Encouragement

The scientist concluded with an encouraging statement. He informed his audience that the “greatest hope for the future lies in the better educational and broader understanding of the common man. Mind and heart,” he stated, “must meet the solution of the present world problems and the greater understanding of the common man.”

Millikan branded indifference and isolationism as a worse thing than war. “Because,” he said, “it is not only world-embracing and un-Christian but permits the periodic recurrence of wars.” In identifying science as the organized use of knowledge, he demonstrated the contrast of war, which is the practice of the unbridled law of the jungle.
