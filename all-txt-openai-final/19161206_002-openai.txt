In this, the last issue of The Davidsonian for the year 1916, the editors wish for every student good aim,
invulnerability, and no hard luck during the coming siege of examinations, and to each reader, every blessing and joy that
the approach of Christmas can bring.

Yes, it has been a great football season, and whenever we think of the record Davidson has made, we feel
like sticking our chests out and holding our heads up. And we are all anxious to get home, too, to
“horse” that fellow from Clemson, or Roanoke, or even Va. or Carolina, that we played rings around. And we want
to nudge that Tech friend in the ribs, and just remind him how Tech would have, but for hard luck,
been tied by a little Red and Black team.

It’s fine to belong to a college that has gotten such a reputation for demonish fighting, wonderful speed and teamwork,
and yet clean as clean. There is not one of us but feels thankful to every member of the Varsity,
every Scrub, every bow-legged, hump-shouldered, nervy little roughneck that went out for practice, and every alumni who has helped. But
to the one above all who has made this record possible, who has worked hardest and most unceasingly, and who
has put his best into it, we owe the greatest gratitude. Long live Coach Fetzer at Davidson.

**MISSION STUDY CLASSES BEGIN AFTER HOLIDAYS**

The last meeting of the Bible study classes for the term will be held Sunday morning at the usual time.
After the Christmas holidays, the Mission study subjects will be taken up. One of the early meetings of the Y.
M. C. A. will be a rally meeting for the organization of these classes, and the work will begin on
the Sunday following the meeting. The leaders and subjects for the courses have not been definitely settled yet and so
a complete announcement in regard to them cannot be made at this time.

Miss Wood, of Charlottesville, Va., is the guest of Mrs. J. M. McConnell.

**AN ADDRESS GIVEN ON WOMAN SUFFRAGE**

Speaking under the auspices of the Mecklenburg Equal Suffrage League, Miss Gertrude Martin gave a most able address on universal
suffrage at the Civic League room on Tuesday evening, November 28th. Miss Martin is a native of Arkansas. She is
a speaker who appeals to the intellect rather than to the emotion and the audience is at once struck with
the knowledge of the subject which she shows. After she had finished her address she invited anyone who might desire,
to ask questions relating to her subject, of which there were quite a few.
