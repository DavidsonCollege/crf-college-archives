THE DAVIDSONIAN

By MIKE CHAPMAN
Staff Writer

The wrestling team came home for the first time in two weeks this past Saturday, only to fall 40-3 to
a strong Chattanooga squad. The Wildcats took on The Citadel last night, and although more players contributed winning decisions, the
result was still a disappointing 32-10 defeat. The loss was the third in a row for the 'Cats, who have
now dropped their overall record to 6-8-1 and their league record to 1-3-1.

Chattanooga managed to earn victories in nine of the 10 total bouts in the first match. Seven of these nine
victories were either by major decision or by fall. The Mocs are undefeated in the league at 3-0. The lone
victory for the Wildcats came from Marcus Boyd ’07 in the 174-pound match. Boyd earned a 5-3 decision over Chattanooga’s
T.J. Sayers. Boyd, who has now won nine straight matches for the Wildcats, improved his record to 12-1 for the
season.

“Chattanooga is a tough team, but there’s no way they should have beat us that bad,” said co-captain Matt Leonard
’06. “Some of us made a lot of mistakes, but it’s nothing that can’t be fixed before March.”

Although the loss was clearly a tough one for the team, the majority of the Wildcat wrestlers have learned from
it and have already set their sights on the conference tournament in March. “It was a good learning experience for
the team since a lot of the UT-C guys are the ones we need to knock off at the conference
tournament in March,” said Boyd. “We didn’t let the loss get us down; it’s just motivation for the rest of
our season.”

On Tuesday night, the grapplers traveled to Charleston, SC, and once again fell in a conference match to The Citadel,
32-10. Patrick Coman ’06 (125) scored a major decision to beat his opponent. Leonard (149) and Matt Pendle ’08 (157)
each contributed a winning decision to accrue the Wildcats some points in the competition. The Bulldogs improved to 3-2-0 in
the Southern Conference.

For the senior wrestlers, the two dual matches and the conference tournament are all they have left in their athletic
careers at Davidson. And for many, this is an abrupt realization. “As far as having only two dual matches left,
as a team, it hasn’t really hit us yet that the season’s almost over,” added Boyd.

Golfers compete at Rio Pinar Tournament

The golf team traveled to Orlando, FL to compete at the Rio Pinar Intercollegiate hosted by the University of Central
Florida in its opening match of the spring season. The Wildcats completed the tournament tied for 14th place.

The first day, David Fowler ’09 shot a 75, putting him at the top Wildcat spot and only three over
par. After shooting a 40 on the front nine, Fowler managed a 35 on the back nine to put him
in 16th out of the 90 individual spots. Other Davidson golfers include Alex Knoll ’07, who shot a 77 and
is now in 41st place in the individual spots. Steve Mayo ’07 and Tim Dillion ’06 came in just above
80 with respective scores of 81 and 82. Michael Saari ’09 walked away from the first round with 80. His
next two rounds were 76 and 70, giving him the lowest three-day total for any Davidson golfer.

The match concluded yesterday morning with the final round of the 54-hole event. Saari led the team with a 76
and a two-under 70 and helped to bring the Wildcats to a tie for 14th place. Knoll finished a stroke
back from Saari and now both men are tied for 38th. The golf team will continue its season when the
Wildcats compete in the Wexford Plantation Intercollegiate on Feb. 26-28 in Hilton Head, SC.

Mocs take down grapplers 40-3

Wrestling lost to the Chattanooga Mocs 40-3 this Saturday.Just started to get into a good rhythm.” The wrestlers host James
Madison and Duquesne this Sunday to cap off their dual season. “We’ve already accomplished so much this season as a
team,” added Leonard. “There’s no reason we can’t finish out the year on a good note.” Sending the seniors out
on a good note is just as important to the underclassmen as well. “It hasn’t hit me yet that the
seniors only have three dual matches left in their careers,” said Boyd. “They will be sorely missed.” Wrestling begins on
Sunday at 1 p.m. in Belk Arena.

Basketball, from page 16

Jason Morton ’06 showed excellent resiliency by coming off a knee injury and one day’s rest to contribute 27 points
and set a team record for 100 percent three-point shooting, going 6-6 from beyond the arc. The Wildcats also got
key minutes from Andrew Lovedale ’09 and Eric Blancett ’06, who combined for nine rebounds, four of them offensive. The
two averaged just 10.5 minutes between them. “Jason Morton played spectacularly, and I think that Lovedale had his best game
in a Davidson uniform,” said McKillop. “When you get your bench making those contributions, you are going to be successful.”
Johnson continued to be strong inside as he racked up 19 points and 10 rebounds for his fourth double-double of
the season. The Wildcats performed well on the boards as a team as they out-rebounded the Citadel 44-27 and picked
off 16 offensive rebounds, giving them second chances and providing psychological daggers to the defense.

The story of this game, however, is the emergence of a team leader that has been sorely lacking all season.
Jason Morton has demonstrated that despite not being a starter, he will emotionally and physically lead this Wildcat squad with
hot shooting, unrelenting defense, and contagious hustling. Perhaps one of the keys of Davidson’s struggles this season has been the
inability to take pressure off of the shots of Winters and McKillop and allow them to play wide-open basketball. Morton
has stepped into that role now and defenses can no longer focus on a single outside or inside threat but
rather must contend with a slasher whose ability to shoot and spread the ball around makes the Wildcat offense all
the more dangerous. Morton has also provided the defensive spark to pressure opponents on the ball and create quick-scoring transition
opportunities.

On Monday, the Wildcats showed that despite the toughness of their opponents, they can overcome a deficit and pick up
a win in a hostile environment. Perhaps it is no coincidence that the Wildcats have only been able to do
that on the road in Charleston, S.C. The Southern Conference tournament looms large on the horizon, and the Wildcats want
to establish momentum and good play in the historic Southern city. Despite their four conference losses, Davidson remains in the
thick of the Southern Conference race for first place as they are one game behind Georgia Southern and Elon, who
sit with tied records at 9-3. Facing fourth-place Furman on Saturday at Belk Arena, Davidson will look to exact revenge
from their January road loss to the Paladins.
