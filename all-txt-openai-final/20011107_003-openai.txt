As concern about terrorist attacks works its way into even the most sanguine heart, many Davidson residents have wondered what would happen in the event of an accident or crisis at the McGuire Nuclear Plant. (The plant, located in nearby Huntersville, is owned by Duke Power.)

After receiving queries from a handful of parents and students, President Bobby Vagt asked The Davidsonian to print instructions for students and staff in the event of an emergency.

If there were to be a disaster at the McGuire nuclear plant, said Vagt, we will hear a loud, continuous wail. (Most Davidson residents are familiar with the siren; it goes off for periodic tests.)

There are four steps to take when you hear that wail.

Davidson has specific emergency evacuation procedures in case the unlikely disaster should occur at the McGuire Nuclear Plant.
