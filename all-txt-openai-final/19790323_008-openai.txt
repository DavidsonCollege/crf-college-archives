This Saturday morning marks the first CROP walk in the history of Davidson.

At least two hundred students will be walking, including ninety or more freshmen. Some professors, senior high school church youth group members, and other various community people will also take part in this walk. Some people plan to run the route.

Each person who is walking is to get as many sponsors as possible to pledge money for each mile walked. Registration begins and the walkers will take off down the road as a group at 10:00 a.m.

Walkers are urged to bring water, food, signs, or anything to keep life interesting. Albert Connette is going to push a brass bed. William Brown’s boy scout troop will lead the group in song.

No monetary goal has been set by the organizers. “We’re essentially interested in having people walk because they really want to walk,” said John Tucker, one of the organizers.

Other organizers include Merle Miller, Sue Dehoney, and Mike McGrady. See them if you'd like to walk.

A CROP symposium on world hunger will then be held on Sunday, March 25th, in the 900 Room from 7:00 until 8:30 or 9:00. Dr. Paul R. McCleary, the Executive Director of Church World Service (CROP is the fundraiser for this service), will be the main speaker.

Also speaking will be Terence Martin, the Trade and Development issues analyst for Bread for the World (a hunger lobbying group in Washington and New York) and Dr. Paul S. Crane, former medical missionary to Korea.

Everyone is invited to attend. The symposium will clarify what the Church World Service does and where the money goes that CROP raises.

Tucker sees the goals of CROP as two-fold: “to encourage an awareness of world hunger and to promote a feeling of community.” The walk and symposium promise to attend to both needs.

Don’t forget that there is a CROP lunch every Tuesday, 12:30-1:30. Lunch costs 75 cents, and everyone is welcome. Come and bring a friend.

NC-PIRG releases comparative drug price survey results

In an effort to gain support for legislation now pending in the state legislature, the Davidson chapter of NC-PIRG held a press conference early last week to release results of its survey into the comparative prices of brand name and generic drugs. The survey was part of a coordinated effort by PIRGs across the state aimed at revealing the need for a Drug Substitution Law. By using a simple methodology involving telephoned requests for prices on six different drugs, Davidson-PIRG found price differences between brand name and generic drugs to be as high as 60 percent.

At present, North Carolina law prohibits a pharmacist from substituting a cheaper, but therapeutically equivalent, generic drug for a more expensive brand name drug if the doctor has used the brand name on the prescription. The proposed Generic Drug Substitution Law would allow a pharmacist, at the patient’s request, to make such a substitution. To date, 40 states have passed similar legislation.

The PIRG survey was coordinated by Marie Patterson and carried out by six Davidson students. Each student was given the name of one of three brand name drugs or one of three equivalent generic drugs. Each participating PIRG student was then supposed to call and request prices for his particular drug at 12 Charlotte or North Mecklenburg drug stores. By means of this simple method, the PIRG members hoped to gain not a comparison of prices at different stores, but an average percentile difference between the price of each brand name drug and its equivalent.
