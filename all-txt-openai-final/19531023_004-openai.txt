PAGE FOUR SCABBARD & BLADE SPENCER, MARTIN | Thompson, Guerrant | Vespers & Chapel THE DAVIDSONIAN MAKING YEAR’S PLANS BROWNELL AGENTS | Uphold Machiavelli

Davidson's military-minded juniors and seniors, those who comprise the local chapter of Scabbard and Blade, have big plans which should give them another successful year. They should make appreciable progress toward their professed goal—“to place Scabbard and Blade in its rightful rank (among other Davidson extra-curricular societies) on campus and develop better working coordination between the military and other related college activities.” First Sergeant Hasty has great confidence in the organization.

This year Capt. Lamon, chief officer of the society, will attend the national convention of Scabbard & Blade. This is a blue feather in the society's cap as well as Capt. Lamon’s. Tuesday, November 3, at the drill exercises, the annual tapping ceremony will take place. Those advanced ROTC students having maintained an overall B average in ROTC and a C-plus average in their other studies, and who show military leadership, will be honored that day.

This year’s officers include Buddy Lamon as captain; Tom Ligon, first lieutenant and program chairman; Bill Morris is second lieutenant, and Charlie Hasty, the recording secretary, is first sergeant.

The Scabbard and Blade has serious plans this year. They are giving a scholarship award to the most outstanding student in the society and also plan to organize a rifle team. As in years gone by, the local Red Cross blood drive will be sponsored by Scabbard and Blade this spring. On their agenda for the remaining fall term are the following:
- October 27—Talk by Lt. Lamar on the mission of the 7th Army in Germany.
- November 10—A film on “The Effects of Atomic Explosions.”
- November 24—Initiation of new members.
- December 8—Reports from national convention; a film on “Turkey.”
- January 12—Talk by Prof. Wilson on “The Part the Scottish Soldier Played in the Development of the British Empire.”

WCUNC Student Prexy Speaks Here On Honor

Emily Butner of Winston-Salem, N.C., president of the Student Government of WCUNC, will be the special speaker at chapel next Wednesday. She will speak on what honor has meant to her and to her school since her entrance there.

PATRONIZE OUR ADVERTISERS

The Brownell Travel Bureau of Birmingham, Ala., has announced the appointment of Mr. Grier Martin and Dr. Samuel R. Spencer, Jr., as representatives at Davidson for the Brownell Tours, the oldest private tour service in America. A motor coach tour of eight European countries will be offered next summer and will be directed by Mr. and Mrs. Martin. It is planned that a similar tour will be offered the following summer by Dr. and Mrs. Spencer. Ten places on the 1954 tour have been reserved for Davidson College students, the other 15 places to be filled by girls and boys from other colleges.

The tour, leaving New York on June 4 and returning on July 28, is one of the most economical European tours offered by any service. Its cost of $899.50 includes all expenses except shipboard tips and purely personal expenses. The trip across the Atlantic is made on the Italia (formerly the Kungsholm), and travel in Europe is largely by motor coach, providing a better opportunity for seeing native homes, farms, villages, and out-of-the-way places on the way to and from great cities. Experienced English-speaking guides are furnished for sightseeing in England, Holland, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, and France. Four days will be spent in London, four days in Paris, and three days each in Rome, Florence, and Lucerne.

Students interested in considering this tour or any of the many others offered by Brownell may secure additional information from Mr. Martin or Dr. Spencer.

These men will have supervision over the managing editors who have jobs under them, and whose assignments are corresponding to theirs. When asked for a statement from the editor, Bill Hood scratched his head, put on his best intellectual face, and uttered: “Since the first Quips and Cranks published in 1897 the annual has improved down through the years. It has progressed from a collection of tintypes to the modern photoengraved production that it now is. I hope this year's annual will continue this stream of progress and will be the best of the series.”

Yale Evaluates... (Continued From Page Two)
a new concept for Harvard—more emphasis would be placed on general education. All students at Harvard now are required to take three elementary courses chosen from these three areas: humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. The Columbia University plan, embodied in a report published in 1946, “Columbia Program in Action,” also limited the freedom of choice available to freshmen and sophomores. The college prescribed courses in the humanities, sciences, and social studies. This is a plan with a triangular base, consisting of a contemporary civilization course, humanities, and science. Every freshman is required to take this two-year sequence. The objectives of the program are to provide each student with a broad foundation in the chief fields of knowledge. In the changes adopted at Harvard, Princeton, and Columbia, as well as many other institutions, runs one significant thread. The unlimited, free elective system of a quarter of a century ago has been modified and in some instances virtually eliminated. What is sometimes described as the “cafeteria” system of education—in which one takes an educational dish here and another at the far end of the counter—appears to be on the way out. The late Nicholas Murray Butler of Columbia described the free elective system as a “rabbit” program in which the student hopped about the educational garden, nibbling a carrot, sampling a turnip, or stopping at a head of cabbage. When it was all over, would the student come up with a well-balanced menu or would he get indigestion or suffer from malnutrition?

of those close to the bandstand. Another thing which endeared Charlie to the Homecoming crowd was his remark at the opening of the Saturday concert after the heartbreaking loss to P.C. earlier, that “I don't think you want to be talked to much this afternoon, so we'll just get on with the show.” But it didn't take long for Charlie, his trumpet, and “Small Paul” O'Connor with his “Don't Roll Those Bloodshot Eyes at Me,” and “When the Saints Go Marching In,” to bring the crowd around.

During the track season, Sparks stands as one of the Cats’ top performers in the one and two-mile distance events. Homer will again be running number one for Davidson when the Cats take on William and Mary and NC State at Williamsburg tomorrow afternoon. Look for him to place Davidson high throughout the rest of the season.

year. Coach Charlie Parker will welcome back such men as Bobby Joe Key, Charlie Murray, Don Reid, Bill Coe, Bill McElveen, Nabby Armfield, and Monty Littlejohn. The captain of this year’s edition of the Wildcat wrestlers will be Johnny Buxton. Last year Johnny was a standout on the team, and at the end of the season, he placed third in the Southern Conference wrestling meet. This year Buxton will be in there fighting for the top spot and should make it. The Carolinas’ A.A.U. tournament, usually held near the close of the season, will be held in December this year. This journey should provide a few early-season thrills for fans of the mat sport. The freshman team also has several good prospects who have been working out in the gymnastics room. The team has a good nucleus around which to build a team, but more boys are needed to round out the team into one which will go far. So get out there, you freshmen. Make it a good team that you can be proud of.

Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey say: “Our Dad led the brass band in our hometown. He started us on our way tooting in the band when we were eight years old. We watched and studied successful musicians as much as we could, worked real hard, and little by little began to get there.”
