April 28, 1978. The Davidsonian: IMAC Report

By BAD BERNARD, AND HOGMAN
Staff Writers

With but a few weeks remaining in the term, Bernie and Hogman realize that it is time to let our
devoted readers select our first annual Mr. and Ms. IMAC. We have drawn up a ballot containing those persons whom
we feel are best qualified to compete for the titles of Mr. and Ms. IMAC, based upon their participation, group
activities, poise, charm, and personal hygiene. Your job is to decide on two of them to represent Davidson in the
state Mr. and Ms. IMAC pageant.

Mr. IMAC (circle one only)
- Earnie Church
- Rob Murray
- Mike Knowles
- Rick Blinkhorn
- David Williams
- Jim Richards

Ms. IMAC (circle one if possible)
- Beth Baird
- Mary Gilliam
- Jamie Watt
- Jane Perkins
- Judy Inge
- Elinore Marsh

Please see that all ballots are properly marked and sent to “I Want to Help Bernie and Hogman Choose Our
Mr. and Ms. IMAC,” Box 1755, Davidson, NC 28036. Ballots must be postmarked by no later than a few weeks
from now.

The softball season is drawing rapidly to a close as teams scrap for the all-important first seed in the tournament.
Our Top Ten this week:
1. MacFleet and Stuff
2. Dartus Tunic and the Big 13
3. Big T and the Oxytocins
4. We Funk
5. Presto’s Grille
6. Lizard Kickers
7. Old Men
8. Whizz Kids
9. Bone
10. Four Skins

Others receiving votes: What It Is, Bongs, SAE’s.

In games this past week: MacFleet and Stuff moved into our top spot by virtue of a 7-6 scrimmage win
over Dartus Tunic on Sunday. Eddie “Manny Trillo” Nicholson sparkled for MacFleet as he helped to pull off the first
double play in MacFleet’s long history. Meanwhile, the players from DT claim that the game was only a scrimmage and
that they really weren’t trying.

Track eyes relays.
By JOHN DAVIS

Marshall University hosts this year’s Southern Conference Relays on April 28-29, and Davidson’s 6-1 track team is hoping to substantially
improve upon last year’s 8th place finish. Several Wildcats should perform well. Senior Jarry “Orca” Taylor probably has the best
shot at an individual title in his specialty, the hammer, and is also entered in the discus. Doug Horn, who
has recently shown signs of rounding into form, will be running the 1500 and the steeplechase. Freshman Bart Landess has
run a 4:09 and is also in the 1500. Hurdler Dick Jones has the 3rd best time going into the
110-meter highs, and the freshman will compete in the 440-intermediates in addition. Sprinter Robert Alston has recently joined the team
and could be a factor in the 100 and 200. He won both events decisively in last week’s meet with
Emory-Henry. Saturday marks Coty Pinckney’s last intercollegiate outing, and the senior plans to depart with a flourish by running both
5000 and 10,000 meters, a la Lasse Viren. He could conceivably win the 10,000 and place in the top three
in the 5000. Pinckney ends his career as undoubtedly the finest runner ever at Davidson.

Planned Parenthood. We give help. Not sermons.

One thing you'll never hear at Planned Parenthood is a sermon on sexual behavior. But we don't preach. What you
will hear are some straight answers to any questions you may have about sex. And some ready solutions to your
problems, including abortion service in our own clinic for women under 12 weeks pregnant. We also provide free pregnancy testing
and counseling. We can help you with birth control methods. And we can tell you where to go for pre-natal
care and adoption services, infertility problems, female sterilization, and V.D. treatment.

892-0206went to find Who’s On Second and then beat him 13-3. Big T is being ripped apart by a bitter
contest between players Ed Ferren, Sandy Tarlton, and Scott Harbottle to see which one can grow the first noticeable patch
of facial hair. (After three weeks, most observers think Ferren may have some.) We Funk vaulted to our number 4
spot as they strengthened their team with a trade that sent Bill Sherwood to the defunct Cannonballs for Ernie Reigel
and Rich Perkey. Perk and Ernest made it all worthwhile for We Funk as they led the team to a
12 to 5 romp of the Four Skins. The Lizard Kickers won their protest last week with the Bongs and
then smoked the War Kiwis 7-5. Presto’s Grille tuned up for their upcoming game with Dartus Tunic as they nipped
Charlie’s Angels 10-9. The Whizz Kids utilized the brutal blocks of Mike Peskosky to nip the SAE’s 7-5 and move
into our number 8 spot. Bone made a courtesy appearance in our top ten as they acquired rookie outfielder Gifford
Piercy and destroyed the Bongs 8-2.

Volleyball competition continues to be fast and heated. The SPE’s have turned themselves into children of the sixties as they
became involved in another protest. This time, Act II got p.o.’d at the SPE’s for palming spikes in a closely
fought loss. Said SPE player T. Rick Kelly, “Okay, so we caught a few and threw them back in their
faces. That's nothing to bitch about.” In other games, Magical Mystery Tour stung Well Hung 15-7, 15-4 and Slauoul struggled
past Punk Patrol, 18-16, 9-15, 15-13.

Our Volleyball Top Ten:
1. Bong’s Last Chance
2. Magical Mystery Tour
3. Will’s Outbasket
4. Slauoul
5. 4th Cannon Act II
6. Johnny Wadd and the Dildonics
7. Last of the Jumpin’ Junkies
8. PDT
9. Network
10. Jay’s Coneheads

A meeting to determine the draw in the softball tournament will be held Sunday night in the IMAC office. Later.
