**Three Egrets**

1.

Three egrets lie in the grass  
taking the morning sun,  
while nursemaids roll  
their strollers by  
and babies cry  
pointing their fingers  
at the snow white birds.

2.

Three egrets huddle in the island’s shade  
behind the willow tree  
watching the skipping stones  
of schoolboys  
sink in the smooth water.

3.

Three egrets fly to the willow tree  
craning their necks to the west,  
and the lovers with interlocking fingers  
pause  
to watch the setting sun.

4.

Three egrets sleep in the willow tree  
one above and two below  
on the damp grass  
waiting for darkness to fall.

**As Life Goes On...**

That death should strike so quickly!

The intensity of those moments seems distant.

Now, soft Cumbrian breezes caress my stunned face;  
Gray shale hills protect the gently rippling water—  
Once a hermitage, a refuge.

Now, the sandy reeds bend in sensuous dance,  
While swans glide past in silent regality.  
Baaing sheep cry, lonely and lost  
As they search the shale crags.

Angrily I stare at this countryside  
That dares to sing in peace,  
That dares to defy!

Wind, reeds, water, sheep—  
All, all accept death.  
And life goes on.

How intensely death shrouds life!  
Yet, life warms the shiver of death,  
As the countryside whispers its mourning sighs—  
The rippling waters are silent tears;  
The baaing sheep are searchers of lost time;  
The dancing reeds are dashed dreams  
Soon borne on soft breezes.

This is the hopeful symphony of nature’s mourning,  
As life goes on...
