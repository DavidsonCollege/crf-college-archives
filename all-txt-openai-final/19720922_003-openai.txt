Union Will Highlight 1950's, Prison System During Year

By JOHN CASSELS
Asst. Features Editor

Programs on assorted themes will highlight activities of the College Union during its first year in temporary facilities. “The Union
programs will try to carry some sense of continuity through the year,” said Peter Sterling, director of the College Union.

A 50’s theme will start the year with a visit by Allen Ginsburg during Homecoming Week. On Oct. 23 he
will speak on the “Literary Development of the Beat Generation.” Also that week will be a fine film featuring James
Dean and a sock-hop in the gym.

Another program will focus on the prison system in the U.S. Ramsey Clark, former attorney general and author of “Crime
in America,” will visit campus for three days in January. Other speakers from around the country will visit throughout the
year.

On Oct. 11, former inmates of San Quentin will visit sociology and psychology classes. That night they will present “The
Cage,” a play written, directed, and performed by ex-cons.

In March there will be a program on the examination of the delivery of health care in the United States.
“We're getting adjusted to new facilities, trying to build the best program we can, and examining the possibilities for a
new union,” said Sterling.

THE DAVIDSONIAN staff will hold its first organizational meeting for the year Sunday night at 9:30 p.m. in the newspaper
offices on the second floor of the Union. All freshmen and upperclassmen interested in joining the staff are invited to
attend. No prior journalism experience is necessary. Staff positions are available in news and sports reporting, photography, advertising, and circulation.
Anyone interested in participating on various investigative teams, as well as those who want to do cartoon or artwork, should
also come to the Sunday night meeting.

After the old Union was torn down in June, the Union was moved to the guest house. Inside the new
facility, offices are located on the main floor, game rooms and the bar are in the basement, and three meeting
rooms and the Davidsonian offices are located on the second floor.

On top of moving woes, the Union Board has had to undergo a change in leadership. Stan Hassinger, Union Board
president, has left Davidson to attend Johnson C. Smith University. Jim Campbell, this year's social chairman and first vice president
of the Union Board, is now functioning as Union Board president.

Sterling emphasized that the activities this year would be low-pressure, informal affairs. The second annual All-Campus Beer Party will be
Sept. 30 on the baseball field, featuring free beer and several groups. The idea is to bring freshmen and upperclassmen
together with their dates and a chance to get to know each other in an informal atmosphere. Special nights, such
as a freshman night or coed night, will be held.

The Hungry I is also back for another year. Many more popular films are planned for this year, with two
or more nights a week booked. Sterling also said.

Play Tryouts To Start Soon

Auditions for Davidson's first drama production of the year, “The School for Scandal,” will be held Sunday, Sept. 24 and
Monday, Sept. 25 at 7:30 p.m. in Hodson Hall. Rupert Barber, drama professor and director of the play, invited all
students, with or without experience, to try out for the English comedy's 15 male and 5 female roles.

According to Barber, the auditions will consist of reading scenes from the Sheridan play, copies of which are available from
Barber's office. “I try to make the tryouts as comfortable and unpressured as possible,” Barber said.

Barber described the play, which will be done in 18th century period, as an “actor's play,” with very good and
balanced leads, excellent smaller ‘character’ parts, and few menial “Here is your hat, sir.” roles. “The roles are open to
all students and none have been cast,” Barber said.

Rehearsals will begin immediately for the play, which is scheduled for presentation Nov. 1-4.that the Fine Film series this year
is one of the finest Davidson has ever had. Throughout the year the Union Board will be developing proposals for
a new union facility. A questionnaire will soon be distributed to students, faculty, and staff on the type of facilities
they would like in a new union. "We are trying to prove you can have a good union program when
you don’t have a Union," Sterling concluded. "We want to show that we can have a program even though we
need new facilities."

The college Union will hold a straw poll next Wednesday to gauge political opinions on the Davidson campus. Students and
faculty will be able to cast votes for either President Richard M. Nixon or Sen. George McGovern in polling places
at the Post Office and Chambers.

### Orientation Revised To Help Freshmen
By THOM NICOLL
Asst. Managing Editor

Traditional orientation for new Davidson students had a few new twists this year under the supervision of Dean of Students
Will Terry and Freshman Class Advisors Skip Holcomb and Rob Krebs. Terry stressed the need "to build community among freshmen
right from the start," and Holcomb emphasized improving faculty advisor-student relations and learning how to work with other students.

To accomplish these goals, changes were made, such as making official the traditional supper with faculty advisors, all of which
were held Monday evening. Another new project was the Freshman Regatta, for which each freshman hall was given money to
build a boat and race it against other halls on Lake Norman on Wednesday afternoon. For entertainment, the hall counselors
provided a skit for the freshmen and their parents on Saturday night, and the freshmen produced a variety talent show
Tuesday evening.

The traditional tour of the library was replaced by "The Library Game," in which roommates paired up to test how
well they could find their way around the library. Another innovation was the Academic Fair, designed to complement the Activities
Fair. "We wanted to familiarize the new students with both the larger and the more obscure major fields," said Krebs.
Professors and upperclassmen from most departments were available to answer freshmen inquiries.

"We plan to stay visible and active all year, especially working with the hall counselors. We'll just handle whatever comes
up," Holcomb said. "My only complaint about orientation was the treatment of the girls. Davidson isn’t really prepared to understand
the coeds. We didn't have anything especially for the girls alone, which may be how it should be," Holcomb continued.

Holcomb added, "I wasn’t at all happy when a number of football players left early from Dick Clay’s talk on
the Honor System." He said that he had understood they were not expected for practice until later.

SGA President Ralph Peeples addressed the new students Monday on student government. He called for the freshmen to join in
and to "keep plugging away" for the college to redeem its promises of excellence in all areas of student life.
Peeples called for a Women’s Committee to help solve the problems of being a Davidson coed, and for involvement in
helping the "other" residents of Davidson who "find themselves on the wrong side of the tracks."

Freshman John Taylor felt that orientation was too long with too much spare time. "The activities have been helpful, but
I would have enjoyed more athletic competition like football and basketball." Another freshman, Ernest Glenn, said that he liked orientation.
"I've had a time to rest without being too bored, just a little lonesome sometimes."

### '72 Yearbook At Publishers

Davidson upperclassmen should be able to obtain a copy of the 1972 edition of the student yearbook, the "Quips and
Cranks," in the "immediate future," according to publication editor Ron Conoley. "I talked to the publishers Tuesday," said Conoley, "and
while they couldn’t give me any specific date, it should be within about two weeks." The reason for the book's
delay was "mostly a photographic problem," stated Conoley. "All of the pictures were taken, but there was a big delay
in having them printed."
