A trio of men’s soccer players—senior Soren Johnson, along with juniors Justin Porter and David Peoples—were named to the 2002 Verizon Academic All-District team as selected by the College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA).

A goalkeeper from Blowing Rock, N.C., Johnson has been the Wildcats’ starting goalie during his senior campaign and has a goals-against average of 0.97. He has played and started in 16 of the team’s 18 matches, recording six shutouts including games against North Carolina and South Carolina.

A defender/midfielder from Norman, Okla., Porter has played in every game for Davidson in 2001 and 2002. This year, he has three assists in 18 games. Porter is part of a defense that is allowing 0.99 goals a game, second fewest in the conference. Offensively, Porter is third on the team in shots with 22. He has a 3.71 GPA and is a psychology major.

A defender from Englewood, Colo., Peoples is a co-captain of the 2002 squad. He is the anchor of the defensive unit that has produced seven shutouts, second most in the SoCon.

Davidson women’s soccer player Leigh Anne Hoskins was also named to the 2002 Verizon Academic All-District team. Hoskins, a native of Lexington, Ky., has been a success in both the classroom and on the field. One of the Wildcats’ leading scorers, she scored eight goals and tallied four assists this season, while maintaining a 3.91 GPA.

She ranks fifth on the all-time goals list at Davidson with 28 career goals and moved into fifth place on the all-points list with 71.

The Verizon Academic All-District team is part of the Verizon Academic All-America program.

**Four Davidson soccer players; Volleyball prepares for conference tournament**

**‘Cats need victories in final three games to maintain fourth place in SoCon**

By Mike Giglio, Sports Editor

Heading into the final stretch of the regular season, the Davidson volleyball team stands at 19-10 overall and 12-5 in Southern Conference play. The ‘Cats currently hold the 4th-place position amidst a tight pack that includes Georgia Southern (17-1) in first place, College of Charleston (16-2) in second, and Furman (14-5) in third. Western Carolina trails the Wildcats by only half a game at 12-6; the remaining six teams in the conference have records below .500.

The most recent week of play opened with an impressive victory over UNC Greensboro (6-24, 4-14) before coming to a disappointing close with a loss to Georgia Southern (23-7 overall). Davidson needs victories in each of its final three regular-season games to maintain its spot in the conference before the SoCon tournament, which will be held in Belk Arena. If the ‘Cats are able to dominate the way they did in their sweep of UNCG, the forecast for the tournament should be positive for Davidson and its fans.

The Wildcats defeated the Spartans in three games, 30-24, 30-19, and 30-21. After a first game that was close until the Wildcats were able to pull away with the score at 24-23, the ‘Cats shut down the UNCG offense, holding the 49ers to a negative hitting percentage in games two and three. Tisha Chapman had a match-high sixteen kills and a .714 hitting percentage on the evening. Sophomore Tamara Gallen led the strong defensive effort with nine digs.

Roles were soon reversed, however, as the ‘Cats were themselves swept by a powerful Georgia Southern squad in an away game on Sunday afternoon. Davidson started off poorly and fell behind 21-12 in the first game before mustering a small comeback that brought the score to within five. The Eagles held strong and ended game one on top 30-25. The Wildcats fought back in a closely contested second game, which saw five lead changes before the Eagles were able to pull away for a 30-24 victory. Southern then took game three by a score of 30-24. Meredith Lorenz led Davidson with twelve kills, and Chapman posted ten kills of her own. Rebecca Teichgraeber played well defensively with eleven digs.

The Wildcats play their final home game of the regular season on Wednesday, November 13th, against Wofford. The game starts at 7:00 p.m. The team then travels to Appalachian State on Friday, November 15th, before closing out the season at East Tennessee State on Saturday.
