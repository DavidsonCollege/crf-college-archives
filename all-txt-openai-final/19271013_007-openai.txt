### THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER 13, 1927

#### Davidson Alumni Council Deliberates Here Today to Decide New Program

**Program For Homecoming Day to Be Outlined**

**FIVE MEMBERS**

**Supper at Maxwell-Chambers Hotel Before Meeting in Alumni Office**

The meeting of the Alumni Council of the Davidson College Alumni Association, scheduled for two or three weeks ago, was
necessarily postponed, but it will be held at Davidson Friday night, practically all members of the council having signified their
intention to be present.

Preceding the meeting proper, the members of the Council will gather at the Maxwell Chambers Hotel, where supper will be
served at 6:30 p.m., the body then adjourning to the Alumni office for their deliberations.

One of the most important matters to come up for consideration at this time will be the outlining of a
program for Homecoming Day, which will be Saturday, October 20th, the date of the V. M. I.-Davidson gridiron encounter. Reports
will be made by the two secretaries as to the progress of alumni work so far this year, with particular
emphasis on the two recent trips that were made.

It is expected that this will be one of the most important meetings of the council this year, since vital
matters pertaining to the future policy of the office will be presented for consideration, even though final action may be
delayed until a later gathering.

The council is composed of Dr. J. P. Matheson, ’99, president; Mr. F. L. Jackson, ’06, secretary-treasurer; Dr. J. C.
Rowan, '04, Mr. Hugh A. Query, '00, and Dr. Oren Moore, ’08.

#### Judge Boyd Celebrates Sixtieth Wedding Date in Greensboro Recently

**Reports Graduate From Davidson in Class of 1866**

News has just reached Davidson that Judge and Mrs. James Edward Boyd celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary on September 12th
at their home in Greensboro, N. C., and friends throughout the state have hastened to send messages of felicitation to
this happy couple on the occasion of their anniversary.

Judge Boyd graduated from Davidson College in the Class of 1866, and served for a time as United States Attorney
for the Western District of North Carolina. He was a member of the historical North Carolina Constitutional Convention of 1875,
winning a great deal of prestige by his work in the convention. It was as United States District Judge, however,
that he won his greatest preeminence. For the past four years, he has been in virtual retirement at his home
at 220 West Washington Street, Greensboro, N. C., as a result of a protracted illness.

Mrs. Boyd, before her marriage, was Miss Sallie Holt, of near Graham, where the wedding ceremony of this beloved couple
was performed sixty years ago.

#### TWO ALUMNI (Continued from page one)

Many colleges have published similar anthologies, which have proved to be sources of publicity, as well as expositions of the
merits of the schools.

Floyd Jones was a member of The Davidsonian staff for two years and was prominent in journalistic circles. He is
now an instructor in English and supervisor of boys in the new Saint Petersburg High School, Saint Petersburg, Fla.

H. L. Shirley was also on The Davidsonian staff and outstanding in journalistic circles. He now holds the position of
instructor in English in Alabama.

Dr. and Mrs. Thomas W. Lingle, of Davidson College, announce the engagement of their daughter, Sarah, to Robert Campbell Garth,
’19, of Charlotte. Mr. Garth, after his graduation from Davidson, received his M.A. degree at Columbia University, and for the
past two years has been a member of the faculty of Hunter College in New York. The romance began while
Miss Lingle and Mr. Garth were studying at Columbia University.

Many Returning Grads Visit at Alumni Office
Class of 1927 Leads List of Returning Alumni—Others Here

Perhaps one of the most decided encouragements to alumni work this year has been the return of an unprecedented number
of the class of 1927 to the campus during the early fall. Occasionally a few of the June graduates return
for brief visits, but the number this year has been noticeably large. Among those who have been on the campus
are W. T. Covington, who will attend Princeton Graduate School; W. A. Christian, Jr., R. S. Wilson, R. B. McQueen
and G. R. Sims, who will be enrolled in Union Theological Seminary; W. O. Green and W. H. Leggette, who
will teach and coach in the Concord High Schools; W. S. Woods, H. M. Austin, L. H. Leathers and J.
W. Keerans, ex-’27, who will attend Harvard; R. L. Mitchell, who will be at Rockingham High School; J. B. Kuykendall,
who is working in Charlotte; L. D. Wharton, Jr., who is connected with the Greensboro Daily News; H. G. Goodykoontz,
who is connected with St. Andrew’s Church, Wilmington; R. H. Ratchford, ex-’27, who completes a technical course at N. C.
State this year, and A. K. Harris, ex-’27, who is connected with the Queen City Printing Co.

Most of the above have visited the office of the Alumni Secretary, and among others were Rev. J. W. Lafferty,
'83, of Rome, Ga., who was in North Carolina to attend the funeral of his brother, Dr. J. S. Lafferty,
’76, of Concord; A. N. Moffett, ’25, who was en route to Louisville Theological Seminary from his home at Dublin,
Ga.; Wallace J. Moore, ’23, of Japan, en route to Harvard; T. L. Ramsey, ex-’28, who will attend Georgia Tech
this year; L. P. Cox, ’25, who will begin his second year in medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, and
W. M. Cox, '24, who has been teaching at Hangchow College, but who will study chemistry at Johns Hopkins this
year. John S. McRae, '27, and Lee S. Short, ’27, are employed by the Alston Tobacco Company at Serres, Greece.
The alumni office is in receipt of a recent letter from McRae. Another Davidson man, Mr. L. A. Steele, '06,
is connected with the Gary Tobacco Co., at Cavalla, Greece.
