volunteered as a health worker in Paraguay, and participated in the reverse mission trip to El Salvador. She believes that simply living in the international setting provides “a real opportunity for growth.”

Future Plans

Beyond studying abroad next year, Ogden plans to attend divinity school with the goal of ordination and perhaps further pursuing a Ph.D. in religion to enlist in the ranks of academicians.

Ortmayer said of the scholarship selection committee’s choice, “We look for a self-confident, self-sufficient person who’s really going to make the best of this opportunity. She is very articulate, very intelligent, resourceful, and confident.”

Because the Smith Scholarship is the “flagship scholarship for this institution created by an alumnus,” as Ortmayer put it, someone who will maximize use of the scholarship is essential. The Smith scholars “will help recruit and define that scholarship for students who follow them,” said Ortmayer.

Tom Smith, the scholarship’s benefactor, is a lifetime member of the Board of Visitors, recipient of a Davidson Alumni Service Award, and director of the John I. Smith Charities, a family foundation.
