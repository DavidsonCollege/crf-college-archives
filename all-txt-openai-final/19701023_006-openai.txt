Wildcat Booters Win Pair; Up Season Record To 5-1

By PETER MICHAEL
Sports Writer

The Davidson soccer team registered victories over N. C. Wesleyan and Appalachian to raise its season record to 5-1. Last
Friday, the booters defeated Appalachian 3-0 in a game highlighted by defense. A strong wind was a definite factor in
the game, and combined with the defenses resulted in only 22 shots at the goal, 14 by Davidson and eight
by Appalachian.

Davidson scored first on a Guamundur Karlsson penalty kick. The score remained 1-0 until the middle of the second half
when freshman Richard Spinner and junior Brian Tarr scored goals in a three-minute period.

In Tuesday's game, Davidson defeated N. C. Wesleyan 6-1 in a game played in heavy rain. Footing was a major
problem as players were unable to cut quickly or recover quickly after being faked. Although Coach Harry Fogleman started a
team consisting of reserves, he brought in the starters in the second period. The reserves played well and gained game
experience which they all needed.

The score was tied at 1-1 at halftime, both goals being scored on penalty kicks, Davidson's by Karlsson. Davidson broke
the game open in the second half by scoring three goals in the first five minutes. Sophomore Johnny Robinson started
the scoring by heading in a goal on a cross pattern with an assist from Dick Levan, the junior team
captain. Richard Spinner scored two strong goals, the second unassisted on a drive through two Wesleyan defenders.

According to Assistant Coach Peter Sterling, the third period today (the Wesleyan game) was the outstanding period of the year.
What we fielded today was a much improved team over the beginning of the year.

Wildkittens Open Season With 22-18 Win Over Evans

By DAVID TIERNEY
Sports Writer

Quarterbacks Steve Keller and Mike Allport threw three touchdown passes to flanker Walt Walker as the Wildkittens defeated a tough
Evans Junior College 22-18 last Friday to open the season. Head Coach Gene McEver was pleased with the performance, considering
that Evans was playing its sixth game of the season. “Our boys were really out there hitting,” he commented, “and
that’s what counts.”

The Evans team, Coach McEver said, was much bigger and better than expected, and the Davidson running attack had some
trouble getting started. “Their boys were also out there hitting and tackling hard,” McEver stated.

Davidson took an early lead in the second quarter at 8-0, but right before the half Evans scored on a
long pass to tie the game 8-8. The teams traded touchdowns in the third period, and were deadlocked at fifteen
all until Evans scored a field goal with six minutes to go. With a third and nine situation, Walker caught
a 60-yard pass to give Davidson the victory. Besides Walker, Coach McEver cited defensive end Jim Purcell as playing a
particularly good game.

This Friday the Wildkittens travel to Winston-Salem to play the Wake Forest freshman team next Friday afternoon at 2 p.m.

The Davidson Wildcats were downed last week 31-24 in their homecoming game by the Purple Paladins of Furman University on
Richardson Field. “Furman was able to capitalize on their breaks throughout the game,” commented Will Campagna, backfield coach for the
Wildcats. “It could have easily gone the other way.”

The Wildcats held the lead for the third quarter and a short time during the fourth, but were unable to
stop two long Furman drives in the fourth.Quarter, Mark Thompson completed 16 of 38 passes for 182 yards.

Cagers Please Holland In Preliminary Practices

By DAVE TIERNEY
Sports Writer

Coach Terry Holland has been very pleased with the first few practice sessions of the ‘70-71 Wildcat cagers. “I am
really surprised to note such marked improvement in so many of the players,” Holland stated. He specifically noted Eric Minkin,
John Pecorak, Duncan Postma, Ren Stelzer, and Billy Pierce.

Holland noted Minkin’s great improvement of his offensive moves along with terrific strength. “Twenty points and fifteen rebounds per game
from Eric,” the coach commented. “Pecorak has also looked good. He is a Huckel type competitor and has a fine
chance of cracking the first five. Strong and Postma have looked superb in the drills, and a tremendous battle for
the point position seems to be developing between Pierce and Stelzer.

“The biggest strain for a coach this time of year is turning the corner, getting the players to enjoy the
game again instead of having them dread each practice session,” Holland quipped. “The coaches are here to teach primarily, and
not to discipline.” The players must be serious themselves each time they step out on the court.

Holland commented also on the excellent physical condition of the players. “Although the team lacks height, it is physically strong.”
So one can only conclude that this year’s ‘Cats are not going to be outplayed.

The ‘Cats netted 108 yards rushing against the Paladins. “Furman ran the type of defense we expected,” Campagna said, “and
weren’t really as strong as they appeared to be. Thompson hit almost half of his passes and there were 5
or 6 that the receivers just dropped.”

“The biggest surprise we found in Furman was the amount of passing they did. They had passed very little in
their previous games and then against us they opened a stronger attack.” Furman did not pass as often as the
Wildcats, but managed to complete their passes at strategic times throughout the game.

Campagna said that he did not see the Paladins defensive backfield as the basis for Davidson's passing trouble, but instead
the pressure blitzing linebackers placed on the quarterback. “Blitzing is pure guesswork,” he said, “and they guessed well.” If we
had run anti-blitz plays at the proper times, we could have had a lot better showing.

Campagna further emphasized the importance “breaks” played to the Paladins throughout the game. “When they blocked a field goal attempt
from 22 yards it was a terrific boost to their game,” he said, “at the time we were ahead 21-17
and it would have given us a sizeable margin.” The Paladins recovered the ball and went on to score, turning
the tide to 24-21. The ‘Cats later missed another field goal attempt.

Another “break” Campagna pointed to was an interception in the third quarter. A Furman defensive back hit the receiver forcing
him to lose control of the ball and allowing an interception.

Scoring for the Wildcats was done primarily by Mike Mikolyunas who caught two touchdown passes. Rick Lyons also added a
six-pointer on a Wildcat pass. Harold Wilkerson kicked one field goal and three points after touchdowns.
