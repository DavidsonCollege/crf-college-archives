The women’s basketball team had a rebuilding year, according to Coach Dee Mayes. The team will look to improve on its 3-18 record next year. The relatively young starting squad, composed of four sophomores and one senior, showed improvement as the season progressed. Sophomore starter Mike Frankhouser demonstrated the team’s promise with her election to the North Carolina Division III All-Conference First Team. Frankhouser had a superb season, scoring an average of 18 points per game and pulling down 11 rebounds.

“It was a long year as far as winning games,” Senior Captain Kirby Owen said, “but the people involved in the basketball program made it a great experience, and point to continued strength and chances for improvement next year.”

The team will lose two valuable players next year. Owen, who is graduating, has demonstrated strong leadership in her three years on the team. Her quickness was responsible for numerous key plays. Foreign exchange student Harriet Holshuijsen will be returning to her native Holland next year. Her contributions came in the latter half of the season as she gained experience and skills in a sport which was new to her.

Sophomore starters Frankhouser, Jeanne Womack, Mitzi Short, and Carol Heppner should all be ready for strong play next year. Short and Heppner were aggressive on the defensive court this season and spurred the offense with solid outside shooting. Womack and Frankhouser, the team’s leading scorers, were also strong in rebounding and inside play. Good play under the basket was provided by sophomore Kathy Morell. Other returning players include freshmen Debbie Hayes, Nancy Bondurant, and Laura Hills, sophomore Amy Crittenburger, and junior Barbara Hoopes.

Coach Mayes, who will be returning for her second year as head coach, said this core group, along with some strong prospective students, make her optimistic about next year’s season.

Wrestlers dramatically improve record to .500

The Davidson wrestlers wrapped up their season with a 36-13 win over Washington and Lee, a 60-0 massacre of Barber Scotia, and losses to East Carolina and Campbell College (24-18). The Cats’ final record was 8-8, a great improvement over last year’s 2-8 record.

Among the team’s bright spots this year were Junior Scott Smith (134 pounds) who finished the season at 20-7, and Freshman John Breidenstine (150 pounds) who sported a record of 20-11-1. Sophomore Van Wagner (142 pounds) at 10-7 and Senior Captain Dave Nichols (190 pounds) at 11-11 for the season also contributed outstanding performances.

The post-season Southern Conference Tournament was a bit of a disappointment to the team. Davidson’s overall performance was greatly hindered by injuries that plagued the wrestlers through much of the season and the tournament. At the championships, Eric Hill (118 pounds), Todd Kimsey (126 pounds), Chris Tiernan (158 pounds), Tate Nichols (177 pounds), Dave Nichols (190 pounds), and Svend Pedersen (Heavyweight) were eliminated with two losses each. Van Wagner, John Breidenstine, and Bob Kear (167 pounds) finished the tournament with 1-2 records.

Coach Bob Estock commented that the Davidson wrestlers were “not as physical” as the other teams in the conference and that more weight training was needed in the off-season. Estock hopes that more intense training will prevent injuries. Estock especially cited Van Wagner, who lost by a single point in the Southern Conference semi-final consolation, as one who must “overcome his injuries.” According to Estock, Wagner is an “excellent wrestler” and will be a strong contender for a Southern Conference championship next year.

Swimmers smash records

The Wildcat swimmers, under the direction of Coach Pat Miller, concluded one of their strongest seasons ever, finishing 11-2 in dual meets. Davidson finished fourth ofSeven teams competed in the Southern Conference Championships held in Charleston, South Carolina. The season was an outstanding one for individual performers as well. Seven of the swimmers—Warren Beck, Mike Schremmer, Craig Allen, Craig Finger, Bill Crone, John Edwards, and Frank Bright—were named to the All-Conference team. The team broke 11 of 19 school records during the season. Warren Beck broke records in six events: the 200 free, the 100 free, the 200 backstroke, the 100 backstroke, and two team relays. Mike Schremmer broke four records, including the mile or 1650 free, in which he shattered his own previous mark by 24 seconds. Craig Finger set a new mark in the 100 butterfly, as did Keith Riddle in the 100 breaststroke. Frank Bright set a new school record in one-meter diving. Bright’s new school record and all-conference selection are exceptional since Davidson does not provide diving facilities.

### Rifle Team Posts 18-7 Performance

The Wildcat Rifle team posted an outstanding season under the direction of Coach Ransom Cooper and Captain Pat Stuart. This year was Cooper’s last at Davidson. He has been reassigned to Fort Lee in Virginia, and later to a post in Augsburg, Germany. The team finished 18-7 in dual match competition. Davidson finished fourth in the Southern Conference meet at Lexington, Va. Junior Craig Rice was named to the all-conference team as one of the top ten finishers.

Another big loss to the team was Scott Smith. Because of stretched ligaments in his knees, Smith was not able to wrestle in the tournament. Bob Kear and Dave Nichols were forced to default three matches because of injuries. The team will lose seniors Dave Nichols and Svend Pedersen this year. Tim Brotherton (158 pounds), who finished the season at 6-12, will spend his junior year abroad. Twelve wrestlers, however, will return. With this year’s greatly improved dual season record, it looks as though Davidson wrestling will definitely be a force to be reckoned with next year. In Coach Estock’s words, “the future looks bright.”

### Owen’s Intense Moral Support

By CHRIS TIERNAN, Staff Correspondent

While most Davidson students were enjoying their vacations, the members of the winter track team were competing in the Southern Conference indoor track meet at V.M.I. A second-place finish by Lance Sisco in the 60-meter high hurdles and a fifth-place finish in the 800 meter by Dave Stosur (2:01.1 seconds) helped the Wildcats to 15 points and the best Davidson showing in recent years. The Wildcats finished one point out of sixth place. Senior Co-Captain Dick Jones cited the intensive workouts under Coach Frank and greater team depth as key to the positive results. With the success of the winter season and the added depth of new team members, the Wildcats are looking forward to a winning spring track season which opens against Washington and Lee on Saturday.
