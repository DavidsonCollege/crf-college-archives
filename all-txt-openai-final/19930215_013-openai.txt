**Return of Veterans May Mean Success on Links**

**By Will Siler**

“Windex” might describe Erin Butcher best. A freshman on this year’s women’s basketball team, Butcher has been cleaning the glass
on basketball courts throughout the Southeast this winter and is currently ranked 11th nationally among Division I rebounders. She yanked
down 19 rebounds against Pfeiffer, 15 against Barton, 18 against Wofford, and tied a school record with 23 rebounds at
Lynchburg in late January.

Butcher seems blessed with the ability to be at the right place at the right time. She leads this year’s
team with 17.2 points per game and 12.3 rebounds. But all this success is not new to Butcher. Butcher was
honored at a banquet this past Saturday in Pittsburgh where she received the Dapper Dan/Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Female Athlete of the
Year award for her achievements at Mt. Lebanon High School from 1988-92. She was joined at the banquet by Bill
Cowher, the head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers, who received the Man of the Year Award; Dante Calabria, a freshman
basketball player at UNC, who was named the Male Athlete of the Year; and Mike Singletary, a retired linebacker with
the Chicago Bears, who received the Farewell to Sport award.

Butcher was surprised to get the award but has been excited about the banquet for weeks. “I’ve got an autograph
book I’m going to take with me,” she said before leaving for Pittsburgh.

At Mt. Lebanon in Pittsburgh, Butcher lettered all four years in both basketball and soccer. In basketball, she averaged 22.8
points per game and 17 rebounds her senior year, capping a career in which she established the record for career
points at Mt. Lebanon with 1,204. Butcher also was a standout in soccer at Mt. Lebanon. During her career, she
established school records for goals, 124, and assists, 56. As a senior, she was named a first-team All-American by the
National Soccer Coaches Association of America, and USA Today ranked Butcher’s team as high as second in the country.

Butcher was heavily recruited by several schools throughout high school but chose Davidson over schools such as Notre Dame and
Cornell because, she says, “I wanted to play both [soccer and basketball], and Davidson offered the type of academic environment
I wanted.” Butcher only played in nine games this fall for the Davidson women’s soccer team due to a knee
injury at the beginning of the season.

**Victory at Furman Breaks Losing Streak**

**By Bruce Balestier**

The Davidson basketball team boosted its lagging self-esteem and reasserted its claim on a first-division finish in the Southern Conference
Saturday afternoon at Belk Arena with a 76-64 win over Furman. The victory ended a three-game losing streak and moved
the Wildcats (10-11, 7-6) into fifth place in the league standings.

After a close first half that ended with Davidson trailing 30-29, Furman pulled away early in the second. Tazari Green’s
basket in the paint was the last of 10 straight points that gave the Paladins a 44-34 lead with 15:31
left and provoked a Davidson timeout. Said Davidson coach Bob McKillop after the game, “Our shot selection at that point
was not good. We were playing very passively. We decided to get our big men involved and it opened up
the perimeter for us.”

Center George Spain scored five points and guard Jason Zimmerman seven, including a pair of three-pointers, in an 18-5 run
that gave the Wildcats a 52-49 lead, and after that, they never trailed. But it still took some clutch hoops
to earn the victory. One of them came with 4:03 left when center Detlef Musch, who led Davidson with 18
points, converted a three-point play for a 61-56 lead. The outcome was still uncertain with 2:28 left when Davidson called
timeout with a four-point lead but just 12 seconds left on the shot clock. Forced to create something when a
set play broke down, a double-teamed Zimmerman found Alpert at the left baseline. Alpert took a dribble and pulled up
to hit a 14-foot jumper for a 65-59 lead. The Wildcats made 11 of 12 foul shots in the final
2:06 to pull away.

The status of Alpert, who tore cartilage in his right knee Wednesday night against UNCC, was uncertain before the game,
but he turned in a performance that McKillop called “gutty and courageous.” Alpert had sat out the previous two practices
to give the knee some rest and decided to play Saturday only after some deliberation. “I was pretty hesitant,” he
said. “I hadn’t played for a couple of days, and I wasn’t sure how it would react to real running
and game situations. But once I got out there and the blood started circulating, I pretty much knew I wasn’t
going to have a problem.” Alpert’s knee may require arthroscopic surgery at season’s end, but doctors say there’s no real
risk of further injury, and he has been cleared to play in the team’s remaining games.

Zimmerman added 17 points (three of four three-pointers) for the ‘Cats. Wednesday night at Belk Arena, UNC-Charlotte, fresh off a
win over 17th-ranked Tulane, rode freshman guard Andre Davis to an 80-69 win over Davidson. Davis, a product of Charlotte’s
Independence High, hit five of seven three-pointers and 12 of 12 free throws on his way to 33 points. Davis
scored 18 in the first half, including 11 straight as UNCC built a 22-8 lead midway through the half. But
Davidson closed the half with a flurry, closing to 33-29.On Alpert’s two free throws, UNCC led 35-29 at the half
when Malru Dottin wrested the ball from J.D. Heuer and banked in a 20-foot shot as the buzzer sounded. The
49ers extended their advantage to 62-47 when Dottin drove and scored with 7:04 to go, but the Wildcats fought back
into contention, closing the gap to 67-62 on Zimmerman’s basket in the paint with 3:44 left. From that point, though,
UNCC made 13 of 14 foul shots to decide things. The 49ers, 61% as a team at the line for
the season, shot 76% (29-38) for the game. Janko Narat had 14 points to lead Davidson. Last Sunday in Charleston,
The Citadel defeated the Wildcats 68-58 in a very physical game.

On February 28, the Davidson golf team will begin their spring season at the Francis Marion Spring Intercollegiate Tournament with
hopes of improving on their fall season. The ‘Cats started the fall season strongly, but they seemed to regress as
the season continued. With the return of juniors Will Coble and Mark Raber, the lineup becomes more solid and there
is a good chance for improvement. Coach Gordon Mietz looks forward to the upcoming season. “I’m hoping with Mark and
Will back that we will have a stronger spring,” he said. Raber and Coble will need to replace the leadership
and experience of first-semester captain, Will McDaniel. McDaniel, who left this semester to study abroad, had the finest performance of
the fall season when he shot 75-76 at the Maggie Valley Golf Tournament. Therefore, Mietz looks forward to the return
of Coble and Raber. “They were regulars in their freshman and sophomore years,” he said. “I am hoping that their
addition to the team and if they can regain the form they had during their freshman and sophomore years they
are going to help us.”

Mietz also expects solid performances out of freshman Slade Worley and sophomore Kevin Miller. During the fall season, Worley managed
to break 80 twice. Miller has played well for Davidson in the past and is very capable of posting low
scores. Mietz also expects big things out of junior Jimmy Jackson: “I would like to get him in the lineup
more often, because he has the potential to play very well. However, he has been hampered by academic commitments.” If
Coble, Raber, Miller, and Worley all play like they are capable, and Jackson plays more often, the golf team should
experience considerable success.

The ‘Cats started the fall season with a bang; they shot their best score of the season at the Maggie
Valley tournament. Mietz assumed that the team would build on this, but that never happened. He said, “After that, the
next three tournaments were not as good. It was kind of disappointing, because I thought that after starting out strong
we would improve.” Mietz believes that the reason the Cats faltered as the season progressed was that he was forced
to use nine different players in tournaments. Golf tournaments are played during the week and many times the players cannot
afford to miss the two days of classes. Mietz hopes to have solved the problem this spring, because out of
the five tournaments, two are scheduled for Spring break.

This spring, Davidson returns to the Southern Conference, a historically strong golf conference. Mietz said of the competition, “History tells
me that most teams we play in Division I are stronger than us. I don’t expect us to win any
tournaments, but if we shoot some scores in the 310 to 315 range that will make me extremely happy.” The
Cats will face some extremely tough schools: Georgia Southern, UT-Chattanooga, Furman, East Tennessee State, and Marshall. Mietz does not expect
the team to finish at the top, but with some solid play the Cats should have a successful season.

Young & Sharpe Lead Women to Win

By Robert Lloyd-Still

Throughout the entire season freshman Erin Butcher has led the ‘Cats; however, on Friday night two other freshmen, Maggie Young
and Tonya Sharpe, stepped up. After struggling through the hardest stretch of the season, the Davidson women’s basketball team broke
out with a 57-44 win against Charleston Southern. Earlier in the week the ‘Cats faced their only opponent in the
Southern Conference, Western Carolina, and lost 71-57. Although the ‘Cats lost three games in a row coming into the Charleston
Southern game, Coach John Filar was pleased with the team’s performance. Filar stated, “I have seen a tremendous amount of
improvement. We were competitive in all three games and with one more year’s experience, I think some of these results
may be different.”

On Friday, the ‘Cats returned home and played an excellent game against Charleston Southern. The Buccaneers' defense focused on Erin
Butcher. The Buccaneers limited Butcher’s scoring, but she still managed 11 rebounds and four steals in 37 minutes. When Charleston
Southern collapsed on Butcher, the other ‘Cats stepped up and made Charleston Southern pay. Young and Sharpe played great games.
Young, with 15 points and seven rebounds, punished the Buccaneers with a couple of three-pointers and Sharpe contributed 11 points.
Kristin Solsrud also played well, coming off the bench with 10 points, including two three-pointers.

On numerous occasions this season, the ‘Cats have been winning or close at halftime. Against Charleston Southern, the story was
a familiar one with the two teams tied at 24-24. Solsrud hit a key three-pointer with eight minutes left to
put Davidson up 46-35. After that, Young and Sharpe continually made jumpers to keep the Buccaneers at bay. Butcher will
be honored as the Dapper Dan/Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Female Athlete of the Year.
