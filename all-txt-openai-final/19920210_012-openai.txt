Croft Stone to Pursue Career in Music After Graduation in May
By Bryan Padrick

Defining the music of Croft Stone is no simple task, and a typically pigeonholing review would be an insult. From
his campus debut at Songwriter’s Night in Fall 1988, through his outstanding Midwinter’s Festival performance with Brad Reddick two Saturdays
ago, Croft’s original music has rapidly matured into a distinctive creative sound. From his bouncy early songs to the haunting
and Scottish-influenced St. James’ Reel, creating music that clearly portrays his individual environment has become Croft’s trademark. Entering Davidson in
1988 as a freshman, Croft’s music quickly became popular through performances ofMr. Free, a song born out of his NOLS
experiences in the mountains of Wyoming. This song, along with the plaintive Autumn Song, was later recorded in a Charlotte
studio during Croft’s sophomore year. The popular two-song tape, featuring Reddick and drummer Michael Glaser, circulated widely throughout the Davidson
campus and beyond. Following this release with a year-long hiatus from the Davidson campus while studying abroad in Edinburgh, Croft
returns for his senior year with a large number of strong and original songs. Croft has appeared frequently at FACs,
21-Year-Old Nights, and a variety of other campus-wide events, including a period as lead guitarist/vocalist for the short-lived, but popular
campus band Pavlov’s Dogs. Presently, however, Croft has decided to move forward. On the strength of his impressive musical talent
and with the support of his fledgling production company, Wind River Music, upon graduation Croft plans to begin a series
of dates in clubs and bars throughout the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic States. Though clearly drawing from influences such as Simon
and Garfunkel and Bob Dylan, Croft’s music has nevertheless matured well beyond mere imitation of these greats. Croft has developed
a diverse and personal style resulting in the consistent production of intelligent and highly entertaining songs. Ben Gilmer, a long-time
friend and close companion of Croft, commented that “perhaps Croft’s greatest asset is his ability to transform emotion into music.”
Certainly, it is this ability that allows Croft to compose his music, as his greatest influence is unquestionably an acutely
emotional awareness of his environment. Fortunately, you’ll never hear Croft’s music on Patterson Court, as his music is meant for
the careful listener--not those who’d rather be elsewhere. It is this special quality which makes Croft’s music art, and on
a campus drowning in a stagnant pool of Grateful Dead and other classic-rock clones, his presence is refreshing.

“Love is Still Hell” Chapter IV: Love Psychoanalyzed Without One Using the Word “Codependent”

Love Secret #9: Maintaining a healthy relationship requires the ability to tolerate anxiety.

Sometimes I feel the same way too. Luckily, we have each other.

The helplessness and dependence we experienced as babies initiates the desperate need to be us for the rest of our
lives. But when it comes right down to it, love is the craving for sexual high jinks. When the craving
is thwarted, the object craved strangely becomes more desirable. The craver then perceives the craved object as possessing qualities that
the ego is lacking, and alarms go off.

Sexual overestimation of the craved object increases. It becomes imperative for carnal tension to be relieved, and this is experienced
as pleasure. The unattained ego-ideal would care for you. You have to come to terms with your thoughts. Very pretty
for a cup of tea, right? No lie.

With reciprocal feelings and luck, relief takes satisfaction. Theoretically, this should stifle love, but this is often not the case.
The cravers anticipate that the craving for further sexual high jinks will return. This motivates a sustained, cathectic bond between
the two sexual objects. Anxiety and misgivings lessen, along with the more urgent cravings for sexual high jinks, and the
young cravers live happily ever after.

How come you keep switching channels? It’s driving me crazy.
