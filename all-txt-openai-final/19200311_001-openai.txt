Students and Faculty Meeting Held Tuesday Night to Discuss Plans for a Vigorous Campaign

“Hoover for President!” Monday morning chapel saw the first definite signs in Davidson of the coming presidential campaign. Dr. Lingle started the ball rolling several days before, when he announced a student body meeting on Monday to consider the question, and it seems as if Hoover is going to be Davidson’s choice for the Democratic nomination, for there was an overflow of enthusiasm evidenced.

Louis P. Good was chosen chairman of the meeting, and after talks by Dr. Lingle and Dr. Arbuckle, ardent Hooverites, a combined meeting with the Polity Club was appointed for Tuesday night at 7 o'clock. The band was to be present and everyone was urged to attend. For this meeting was not for Hoover only, but for a discussion of the presidential possibilities with a view of presenting Hoover as the best man for the position of chief executive of our country. It was proposed to have all students and faculty members possible to attend the Tuesday night mass meeting, and to have them come loaded with political speeches, for the most prominent men in the student body were to be called upon for their views.

From this meeting a Hoover club will be formed, with a view of helping present him as the Democratic nominee for President, and to continue the good work till a man better qualified is found or until he is eliminated from the race. The following are the resolutions presented to the mass meeting:

“The present national and international situation is such as to convince us that during the next presidential term the subjects that will loom especially large are diplomatic problems and foreign commerce and finance on the one hand, and the whole domestic industrial situation with its consequent labor and capital conflicts on the other. The isolation of our country, and the formation of leagues of any kind against us must be prevented at all costs, or else the most aggressive measures for national defense must be undertaken.

“We believe it the duty of every American citizen to use his voice and influence in favor of a man for the presidency, who, on the whole, is the best qualified to deal with such far-reaching problems as confront us at home and abroad at the present hour.

“The large mold in which the mind of Mr. Herbert Hoover is cast; his extensive experience in large business and his apparently comprehensive grasp of the domestic economic situation in the broadest sense of the term; his wide knowledge of Europe and of the Orient; his intimate association and personal cooperation with so many leaders in the European countries in his efforts to feed the hungry nations before, during and after our own war venture; and withal, his unfailing Americanism when dealing with the strong men of other lands constitute a rare combination such as we see in no other presidential possibility at the present hour.

“In view of the above observations, we, the students and professors in Davidson College, pledge ourselves as individuals and in organization to exert our influence wherever and whenever possible to bring about the nomination and election of Mr. Hoover as President of these United States, to persevere in this effort until success is attained, or until we are convinced of the availability of a better qualified man, and to this end we hereby form ‘The Hoover Club of Davidson College.’”

Playing every college in the two Carolinas except two, during the recent basketball season, winning four games and losing nine, a record which must not be despised at all, considering the teams encountered, the Wildcats have every reason to be proud of their basketball quint. Of these 13 games, only four were played on the local floor, the remaining nine being played on two strenuous and tiresome trips.

During the early part of the season, the team was hampered a great deal and as a result, got under way with a heavy handicap. When practice began there were only three men of last year’s Varsity back: Chalmers, Schenck and Hall. Hartington was kept out of play by doctors’ orders. In the very first game, the team suffered the misfortune of losing Schenck, stellar guard, when he wrenched his knee severely. He was unable to play any more of the season.

In the first game, which was with the University of N. C., on the hill, the Wildcats trounced the Tar Babies 31 to 20. The team left on a five-day trip through North Carolina the following week, and lost to each of the following teams, Guilford 29-22, N. C. State 30-10, Wake Forest 24-12, U. of N. C. 23-22, Elon 24-18. The spectacular stand made against the University at Chapel Hill featured the trip. Returning home, the Clemson Tigers got away with a 28 to 26 victory. The proposed Virginia trip was cancelled on account of the violent form the influenza had taken in that state. The University of S. C. was taken into camp next 27 to 25, in the most exciting game on the local floor. The squad next left on a four-day invasion of South Carolina. In the first game, Wofford was smothered 38 to 17. The next two games were dropped to Clemson 38-27, and P. C. 37-30. On the final day of the trip, the University was again beaten, by a 27 to 17 score. In the game with N. C. State, a day after the trip back from Columbia, the Wildcats lost to the Tech quint, 37 to 19. The summary gives the quint a record of four games won, and nine lost. Even though they were thus outgamed 2 to 1, the opponents only rolled up 349 points against Davidson’s 310.

In Coach Hengeveld, the team had a man who was always on the job, ready with plenty of suggestions as to playing the game. The “Coach's” patience and perseverance was wonderful, he always being there to dispute any argument not in favor of the five, even after the disastrous N. C. trip. Manager Allison was a peach. The trips planned, gave Davidson a chance to meet practically every team in the Carolinas. The team was entertained at the best places possible while on the trips, and “Bob” was popular — especially around meal time.

In Captain Chalmers at guard the team had a leader who never knew the word “lose” until the final whistle blew. He was on the job constantly, encouraging the men and putting a new impetus into the play. “D. M.” will graduate this year and his loss to the team both as player and captain will be keenly felt.

Brice took care of the other guard position. “S. D.” was the quickest man in footwork on the team and his spectacular dribbles through the opposing five were baffling indeed. Toward the end of the season Brice was locating the basket accurately and made an ideal running guard.

Romefelt, alternating at center and guard, was the mainstay of the defense. Time after time the opponent’s offense ended with “Romeo” the stumbling block. Besides his defensive work, Romefelt also was second highest individual scorer on the team.

Hall, better known as “Prep,” held down one of the forward positions. “Prep” was not used on the offensive much, but was a mainstay in the floor work and assisted greatly in defensive work. He will also graduate, having played on the team for the past two years.

Roberts, at the other forward, was the mainstay of the offensive. The Wilmington lad shot baskets of the spectacular variety from any angle, and will run a close race for an all-star forward position. “Bill” scored half of the points made by the Wildcats.

Striebeck, long, lanky center,assured the Red and Black of the tip-off at any time he was jumping, and was thus responsible for the beginning of any offensive attack launched. “High Pockets” will be back next year, and great things are being looked for with him at the center position. The individual scoring summary: 
* Roberts .......... 153 
* Romefelt ........ 48 
* Hall ............. 4 
* Brice ............ 36 
* Striebeck ........ 14 
* Chalmers ........ 9 
* Shepherd ........ 2 
* Ormond .......... 2

SCHENCK AND CURRIE TO LEAD Y. M. C. A. NEXT YEAR

At a meeting of the Y. M. C. A., which comprises the entire student body, last Monday morning, Lewis Schenck was elected president of the Y.M.C.A.; A. L. Currie, vice-president, and Julian P. Price, secretary. The office of president is only open for next year’s Seniors and the office of secretary for those who will be Juniors. Great interest was shown in the election due to the fact that the student body realizes the responsibility of these positions which have been so ably filled for the past few years. There was much speculation among the students as to who would be elected from the four nominees to direct the work of the “Y” which plays such an important part in the life of every Davidson man on the campus. These men who have been selected from so large a student body on their fitness for service are to be congratulated for their new achievements. By co-operating with them in their year’s work, which begins April 1, we hope to make assured a great success for the “Y” during this year and greater possibilities for the future.

Friday-Sunday Over One Hundred Delegates Expected—Program to be an Excellent One

The time has come when The Davidsonian can do what has been anticipated for some while. A hearty welcome is hereby given to each and every delegate to the Davidson campus, and to the privileges of the college while in attendance on the Annual Conference of the Student Volunteer Union of North Carolina for Foreign Missions. Davidson has been active for the past few weeks in making final preparations for the conference. The committee that was appointed by the Y. M. C. A. has had charge of registration of delegates and they report that 84 delegates have registered thus far. These 84 delegates represent 17 institutions. Several institutions have not sent in their list at the present writing. It is regretted that Carolina College and the University of North Carolina have not seen their way clear to send delegations. There has been no announcement of a program in its detailed form. There have been chosen, however, a list of speakers. Most of these are definitely assured and a few are confidently expected although it is not certain that they will come. The list includes Dr. J. Lovell Murray and Miss May Fleming, who come as representatives of the New York office, and who are both experienced in this work. Mr. D. W. Newson, of Trinity College, is expected along with Miss Helen Hardy, representing the Methodist Board. Rev. J. F. Preston, missionary of Soonchun, Korea, will represent the Southern Presbyterians; Dr. Jno. W. Wood, the Episcopalians; Mrs. Foy Willingham, the Baptists; Mr. J. E. Johnson, Student Secretary of the Carolinas in Y. M. C. A. activities, has assured the committee that he hopes to attend. The opening exercises of the conferences will be held in the church as soon as is convenient after the 8:06 train runs on Friday night. At this service necessary announcements will be made concerning the coming services. All the services on Saturday will be in the church. At these, notice will be given concerning the Sunday services. The arrangements of the local committee include entertaining the delegates Saturday afternoon at an informal social gathering under the auspices of the Y. M. C. A. Saturday evening all delegates will be admitted free to the Lyceum attraction, if they present delegate’s tickets at the door. For the benefit of students who may wish to help in the work and (Continued on page 8)
