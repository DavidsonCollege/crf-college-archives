There was no meeting of the societies Saturday night and of the Philanthropic Society Monday morning. In the Eumenean Society
on Monday morning, C. B. Robson and G. W. Robson gave declamations. Orations were delivered by S. F. McCloy, on
the relation of Japanese immigration to the United States; D. M. Orgain, on the improvements in the conditions of criminals,
showing the change in the attitude of the law upon criminals, the change of their social conditions behind the “bars,”
and the change in the attitude of the outside world toward the ex-convict; L. A. Chambliss, “The Educational Machine,” in
which he pointed out two modern theories of education which are being given a practical test at the present time.
One is the vocational method of training, that is, the training of the child, beginning with the fourth grade, in
some specific trade or vocation. The second method is that of nature study, beginning with the thing nearest the child
and developing along the lines of biology, geography, etc., into the higher branches of study. B. D. Roddey spoke on
the value of a higher education to the business man. He showed that the man with the college education is
the one who wins out in the end.
