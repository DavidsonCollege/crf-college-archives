Lyceum Performance Delights Audience
First of Five Performances Was Given Monday Night.

From the character of the first appearance of the Piedmont Lyceum, this attraction promises to be exceptionally good this year. Last Monday night the Kuehn Concert Company opened the season with a musical treat. This company, consisting of Mr. and Mrs. Kuehn and two assistants, gave a pleasing performance of classical music, both instrumental and vocal. Especially pleasing was the singing of old familiar songs such as “I Am Roaming,” “Suwanee River,” and “My Old Kentucky Home.” Mr. Kuehn at the violin was unusually able in his playing, while his wife proved herself a capable and talented pianist. The singing also was good, Miss Bergh possessing a clear and cultivated soprano voice. This attraction was one of the highest class on the lyceum circuit, and Davidson music lovers were indeed fortunate in hearing the concert. A large crowd greeted the performers.

One interesting fact about the personnel of the company is that one member is a German, another a Canadian, a third a Pole, and a fourth an American. This is the first of five performances. A second will be given at an early date.

MAGAZINE SOON TO COME OUT

The Magazine is not dead. Despite reports that the Magazine would be discontinued, the editor is at work on a forthcoming issue, and looks for a better Magazine this year than ever before. The first issue will come out the early part of next month. All contributions to this issue should be handed in as near October 15 as is possible. Especially does the editor wish to urge all men with an aptitude for writing, and particularly Freshmen who are interested in this kind of work, to write something for the Magazine.

The Magazine this year has two aims in view: first, to increase the life and variety of its contributions; and second, to interest more men in writing for the Magazine. Under the first head, the Magazine intends to introduce several new departments. One of these will probably be devoted to short sketches and dialogues of a few hundred words each. Under the second head, the Magazine intends to adopt a plan somewhat similar to that of the Reporters’ Staff of The Davidsonian. All men interested in writing will be organized into a staff, topics for stories and essays will be suggested, and every effort made to encourage the men in their writing. It is hoped that many men, and especially Freshmen, will join with the Magazine in this endeavor. If you are interested, hand your name to the editor, or to any member of the staff.

The personnel of the staff is as follows: Editor-in-Chief, L. M. Thomas; Business Manager, J. A. Thames; Staff: W. C. Cumming, D. M. Chalmers, William Love, Emery Flinn; Assistant Business Managers, Wm. Currie, R. D. Hall.

The following students have matriculated since the list of students was published: Class of '18: F. W. Hengeveld, F. E. Folkes, R. R. Jones, and E. M. White. Class of '20: T. H. Belk and S. H. Duncan. Class of '21: L. W. Fischel, E. D. Calhoun, W. Dodenhaff, F. Thompson, C. M. McCaskill, N. F. McKellar, E. M. Brogdon.
