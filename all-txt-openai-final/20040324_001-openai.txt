SGA kicks
off ‘April at
the Lake’

By Blair McGraw
Senior Staff Writer

The Student Government Associa-
tion (SGA) has decided to contrib-
ute money and effort for “April at the
Lake,” a series of events that will take
place at the Lake Campus next
month.

Although still tentative, the plans
call for activities on two Friday af-
ternoons starting April 2 and con-
cluding on the Thursday night before
Spring Frolics.

The Union Board and PCC are
helping sponsor “April at the Lake”
which was inspired by members of
SGA who feel that the Lake Campus
is very under-utilized.

Walker Saik ’06 originally pre-
sented the idea to the SGA at its
meeting two weeks ago.

Saik and Wilson McCrory ’07 are
co-chairs of the SGA’s Lake Cam-
pus Committee.

“We want to attract people out to
the lake and make it a center of com-
munity,” said Saik. “We really want
to make this the place kids want to
be.”

McCrory agrees that the Lake
Campus is under-utilized. “April at
the Lake” will have “activities to
bring different demographics out
there,” said McCrory.

The first week kicks off on April 2
with a band and food.

“Live music will be fun for people,
and there will be a festive atmo-
sphere,” said McCrory.

There will also be some types of
inflatable games as a part of a resig-
nation party for Ms. Lula Houston, a
longtime laundry worker.

“We want the first week to be huge
to get momentum for the event,”
McCrory added.

On Week 2, the focus shifts toward
the water as the spring weather con-
tinues to arrive.

“I think people will just have a blast
being outside,” Saik said.

There will be a beach volleyball
tournament, as well as water skiing
and tubing on the lake.

A WALT DJ and an acappella group
are also among the possibilities for
the second week.

“April at the Lake” will conclude
its third and final week on the Thurs-

Trustee subcommittee
to examine religion req.

Extra focus placed on
trustees nominated by
Alumni Association

By Amee Patel
Managing Editor

The Executive Committee of the
Board of Trustees voted unanimously
for the appointment of a subcommit-
tee the weekend before last to con-
sider recommendations for the full
Board regarding the trustee religion
requirement. The new committee
will report its findings to the entire
body as early as the annual Board
meeting in October.

According to President Vagt,
Chairman John McCartney will fin-
ish appointing trustees to the sub-
committee by the end of this week.

This most recent step in the ongo-
ing conversation on the trustee reli-
gion requirement reflects a shift from
broad-based discussion on their
meaning to a more concrete exami-
nation of its various aspects, specifi-
cally the role of requirements for
trustees elected through the Alumni
Association.

President Vagt said, “The commit-
tee will look at the broad issue with
particular focus on alumni trustees.”

According to the Bylaws of the
Board of Trustees, the Alumni Asso-
ciation can nominate eight people to
serve as trustees. The alumni them-
selves vote on these candidates.

The eight chosen alumni trustees
are held to the same religion require-
ments as trustees elected at-large,
however. Critics feel this require-
ment should be lifted, allowing the
eight trustees to better reflect the
makeup of the Davidson alumni and
current student bodies.

Discussion of this aspect of the
College’s religion requirements has
come up several times in the past.
Most recently, in 1993, the SGA pro-
posed that the Board of Trustees re-
move the Christian requirement for
alumni trustees. This proposal lacked
support, however, and disappeared

Throughout the semester, several
graffiti drawings have appeared in
buildings on campus, including
Richardson, Duke, and Tomlinson,
and now Belk.

The graffiti that appeared in Belk
last weekend included obscene illus-
trations and derogatory comments
concerning homosexuals and was
found on bedroom doors, in a lounge,
and on the stairwells of the residence
hall.

Because no one has taken respon-
sibility for the graffiti, the charges for
clean-up and repainting will be
passed onto residents of the halls in
which the damage occurred in accor-
dance with college policy.

The damage caused by graffiti this
year has amounted to $382.80, not
including repair for the latest inci-
dent. This figure accounts for 40
percent of the unclaimed damages so
far this semester, which total
$942.96.

In an attempt to find the person
responsible for the vandalism, Resi-
dence Life Office has launched an
investigation that includes talking
with residents where graffiti has been
written and running reports of catcard
use to identify people entering the
building the night of the incidents.

In addition, RLO has approached
a fraternity that was implicated by
some residents.

Since the latest graffiti messages
harassed and threatened homosexu-
als, Residence Life Office has also
chosen to involve Public Safety in the
investigation. They have thus far
been unable to find the person(s)
responsible.

“Although we have some theories,
we have not been able to identify the
perpetrators,” said Director of RLO,
Dean Marsicano.

President of the Gay Student As-
sociation, Matt Talbert ’05, said the
incident demonstrates the need for
more progress to be made in accept-
ing homosexuals at Davidson.

“It is deplorable that things like this
