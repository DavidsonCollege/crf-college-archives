**RIS & LIVING MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 18, 1995**

**When did you first begin to write; what sort of beginnings did you have?**

When I first started to work here in ‘87, on my break, I just started reading books from home. It just started — you know, “roses are red” — making sentences. It just started springing out, started popping up and never stopped — short sentences of information I learned in school, things like that.

**What things? What most interests you?**

I was doing volunteer work at the Davidson elementary where my children were going to school, and I got interested in that type of work. The children there were having such a problem with reading. It was serious. I found within my family there was the same problem; it wasn’t critical, but I just wanted to do what I could to help my whole family. So that’s why the rhyme — just seeing if they could read it back to me.

**Poetic Promise**

Staff member Verdie Barringer tells.

**Do they write any — your family?**

I have a daughter who takes my poems and critiques them. She helps me to gather words, simplify, learn what it is I write about.

**Who do you read? Who most influences you?**

Dr. Holland, really. Dr. Holland made it all a lot more interesting. One of the custodians introduced him to me, just introduced us, and out of the blue I asked him if he had time to read some writing of mine — a paper I had been writing about children. I just met up with him and asked him. I’m not too shy. He took it with him and kept it a couple of weeks or so, and when he gave it back to me there was a long list of information he wrote on it and never a cut-down. I’m very happy I got to meet him ... The poetry just kept flowing. And I got into a class in ‘92: Dr. Long’s writing class. I took some of my poetry in to David — he gave me a lot of time. And I didn’t think it was supposed to happen that way. He made time for me and said he didn’t mind. He said, “You’re a staff member, and staff members are supposed to have the opportunity to get what they need in order to help their life on campus.”

**You said you began to write for children. Why did you continue — you were successful then. Why the fascination, why still?**

Peace of mind for one thing. And recognition. Black people.

The 1995-96 Artists Series, sponsored by theUnion Board is one brimming with energy, diversity, and charm. Some of the performances from last year’s series include the groovy music of Terence Blanchard, the fascinating ODC San Francisco Dance Troupe, the disturbing message of Oleanna, and Shakespeare’s powerful Macbeth. The first performance of this year’s Artists Series features the Chinese Magic Revue. This multifaceted production features some of the most dazzling displays ever seen — formidable feats of daring tricks and balancing acts, explosive Kung Fu, brilliantly costumed traditional dancing, and a touch of Chinese comedy. These acrobats will appear in Love Auditorium on Tuesday, October 3 at 8:15 p.m.

Emmy award-nominee John Amos, known for his portrayal of Kunta Kinte in the TV series Roots, the father figure in Good Times, and his roles in the movies Coming to America and Die Hard 2, stars in Halley’s Comet. This remarkable tour de force is the hilarious and moving story of an 87-year-old man who shares the memories of a lifetime with the famous comet he saw 76 years earlier as an 11-year-old boy. Don’t miss this brilliant performance on January 22.

On February 16, the Artists Series presents a Monk’s Choir of Moscow in “The Fascination of the Gregorian Chants ‘Arte Chorale.’” The repertoire of the ‘Arte Chorale’ includes not only Gregorian hymns from the 11th to 18th century, but also modern and contemporary compositions of sacred music.

The Forces of Nature is an African dance group that utilizes a unique blend of performing arts including contemporary modern dance, traditional West African dance, and the martial arts. This breathtaking performance will be on April 16.

As a special bonus to the Artists Series, if you purchase your season tickets on or before Friday, September 29, you will receive a free ticket to see the African-American Dance Ensemble, directed by renowned choreographer Chuck Davis. This performance will be on November 7. The price of the season tickets for Davidson students is $10 for all five performances, but only until September 29. Tickets are on sale in the Ticket Office in the Union, Monday through Friday, 2 to 5 p.m. Better hurry; it’s selling out quickly!

Jumpin’ Java jumpstarts the year

What exactly is Jumpin’ Java? In simple terms, it can be described as a place to enjoy coffee, munchies (for those tempting study breaks), music, and several different programs sponsored by the outpost. Best of all, Jumpin’ Java is free of charge. Who could turn down free food and flavored coffee? Donations are appreciated. (Standard donations are 25 and 50 cents).

This year, Jumpin’ Java is more exciting than ever. The Outpost Committee, in conjunction with the Union Board, has created an atmosphere that complements Patterson Court while adding a touch of diversity. In order to offer alternatives to students, the Union and the Outpost have gotten together to make life at Davidson entertaining for all. For instance, the Union sponsors a movie every Friday night, and on Saturday night an event is sponsored, whether it be Saturday Night Live in the 900 Room or an impromptu jam session or poetry reading at Jumpin’ Java. On the Outpost’s opening night, Catherine Palmer and Diane
