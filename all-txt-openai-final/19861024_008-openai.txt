Child’s Cry Saturday Morning

It’s been too hot lately.

Saturday morning about eight o’clock
There was a rosy light and
it was cool and quiet.

I must have just been born when
that child cried out; little in the morning.

A mother was walking in the street
outside her window,
holding the infant in her arms.

Saturday night it was cool again, and
’twas with love herself. We were like
babes in creation. It was that good.
Lord, you’ve just got to wail out
in that big beauty.

James Pittard ’87

For Your Smile (when it was there)

When time reminds me of nothing,
I worry, —
not much,
just enough to fret.

I loved your smile when it was there,
and when it wasn’t
there I put a memory.

The kind of memory you could fall asleep in
without nightmares.

But I have nightmares.
And I’ve forgot that stuff I put in memories.
And time reminds me of nothing.
And I worry,
but not much,
just enough.

The Home Coming
(A Parody of “The Second Coming”)

Turning and turning in a stumbling stupor,
the student cannot see the Cushman,
freshmen fall down; their stomachs cannot hold:
mere anarchy is loosed upon the court.

The brew-dimmed tide is loosed and everywhere
the new drinking policy is drowned.

The best lack all perception, while the worst
are only full of passionless ineptitude.

Surely some de-evolution is at hand.
Surely the Home Coming is at hand.
The Home Coming! Hardly are those words out
when a vast image out of Davidsoniana
troubles my sight: somewhere in the halls of Chambers,
a shape with a lanky body and the head of a man,
with a gaze blank and pitiless as a highway patrolman,
is moving its glazed eyes, while about it
reel shadows of the indignant SGA.
The drunkenness rises again; but now I know:
that one-twenty proof brings stoned sleep
which is oft vexed by the nightmares of bed spins.
And what retching beast, its stomach brimming at its mouth,
slouches toward Belk to pass out?

Return from the Big Sea of Thought

Dean went fishing in the big sea of thought
and showed his mother what he’d caught.
She just sighed and said, “Poor thing,
I bet that sunburn really stings.”

Ruth

Ruth — I looked at the book in your name
and saw the stars in your eyes.
If there’s nothing in a name,
then maybe I’m insane.

But I can’t get closer to you than
your story.
Was Orpah so wrong?
Was it so long ago,
that your voice and your name
were the same?

They say, oh they say that a homecoming nears,
and if I were brave I’d whisper to your ears
that I love the name, Ruth.
I love your name,
and your smile, when it’s there, is wonderful.

H.L.B. Jr. ’89
