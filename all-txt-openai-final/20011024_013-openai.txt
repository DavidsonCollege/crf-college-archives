THE Davidsonian - By Jimmy Swansbrough Sports Editor

After weeks of early morning practice and afternoon workouts, the Wildcat swim and dive teams faced formidable competition from the
Emory Eagles in this past weekend’s season opener. Emory narrowly defeated the women’s team, 130-110, while the Davidson men fell
162-75. Sara Laws ’04 and freshman Melissa Marquez ’05 helped ignite the ’Cats’ fighting spirit in this dual meet held
at Emory. Marquez won the 200 IM in 2:11.71 and followed with a win in the breaststroke (2:24.29). Laws won
the 200 backstroke in 2:09.25, and the team of Laws, Marquez, Lauren Taft ’05, and Jamie Sasanfar ’05 won the
400 medley relay. The final two Wildcat wins came from Jenny Hoekstra ’05 in the 100 free (54.82) and Judit
Otvos ’05 in the three-meter dive (201.90). Trisha Blackwell ’05, Leslie Cook ’04, and Erica Petrosky ’05 followed Laws to
the wall in the 200 back, securing the top four positions, and the 400 free relay team of Hoekstra, co-captain
Kendra Berner ’02, Erin Rosintoski ’04, and Cook nabbed a second-place finish. Shelley Conroy added a second place finish in
the 200 fly, edging out teammate Taft, who finished third. Other third-place finishes came from Kelsey Holmberg in the 1000
free, Rosintoski in the 200 free, and Sasanfar in the 50 free. Overall, the women were pleased with the day’s
performance. Co-captain Beth Summerlin ’02 said, “I was really impressed with the team. Even though we arrived late and this
was our first meet, we performed like the closely-knit team we are.”

On the men’s side, Robert Koch ’04 boasted two of the Wildcats’ four wins, triumphing in the 100 free (49.19)
and 200 free (1:48). Mike Warner ’02 won the 50 free in 22.47, and Chris Wrobleski nabbed the three-meter dive
with 216.85 points. Other key performances came from Charlie Hunter ’04, who finished second in the 200 IM and third
in the 200 fly, and Michael Flowers ’05, who garnered third-place finishes in both the 500 and 1000 free events.
Co-captain Steven Reece said, “Because of our numbers, we lack the depth to compete with larger teams, but each member
swam incredibly well, especially in light of all the hard training we endured over fall break.” The Wildcats eagerly anticipate
the competition of the coming season, which continues this weekend with a dual meet against the East Carolina Pirates. The
meet starts at 1 p.m. in Cannon Pool.

Women third at ECU

The Davidson women’s cross-country team gave yet another successful pre-Conference performance on Saturday, October 13 in the N.C. Intercollegiate Championships
at East Carolina University. All 15 members of Davidson’s men’s cross-country team raced over fall break on Furman University’s golf
course in the NCAA pre-national cross-country meet. Assistant coach Adam Johnson had to assume full coaching duties at the ECU
meet; head coach Jennifer Straub was at home with her daughter Sydnee Jane, born on October 11. Johnson commented on
the meet, “I was extremely happy with nearly everyone on the team running their season’s best time. [The race was
a] good note to go into conference on.” The Wildcats’ strategy to run the 5K course as a preliminaryFor the
conference meet proved effective as the team placed third out of eleven teams. Freshman Anna Brew again led the team,
placing fourth overall with a time of 18:01 and earning Southern Conference Athlete of the Week honors. Close behind was
freshman Sally Stanhope, who placed sixth overall with a time of 18:11. Sophomores Laura Puckett (18:43), Jenna Kruppa (18:52), and
Emily Einstein (19:18) ran stellar races to round out the Wildcats’ top five. Freshman Lindley Swartz (19:37), junior Brooke Kittinger
(19:48), and sophomore McKensy Gruelle (21:07) also made solid contributions to the team. Davidson placed third in the meet with
64 points, behind host team ECU (39) and conference rival UNC-Greensboro (45). Also competing in the meet were High Point
University (118), Mars Hill (145), UNC-Wilmington (166), Gardner-Webb (172), Campbell (180), Warren Wilson (235), Mount Olive (287), and Catawba College
(293). Morale is high, and the ’Cats are training hard for their next competition, the conference meet on October 27
in Charleston, SC.

Colby Broadwater is one of three sophomores racing in this weekend’s conference meet at the Citadel. Candidates for the NCAA
Division I title, the Atlanta Track Club swept both the team and individual titles for the unseeded race. ATC’s Sean
Dollman claimed the individual win, running 8K in 24:55. Returning to racing after a weekend off for the LSAT, senior
captain Dan Gibson led the Davidson team across the cart paths and through the humidity to place 36th in a
field of 295 finishers, with a time of 26:49. Brad Becken ’03 finished the course in 27:20 and was followed
across the line five seconds later by sophomore Chris Schmader. Kevin Bell ’05 and Dave Bunge ’04 passed into the
chute together at 28:02 to close out the team’s scoring, placing the team 13th in the unseeded race’s field of
30. After the competition at Furman, the team was quick to turn its attention to the upcoming Southern Conference Championship,
which will be held this weekend at the Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina. Head coach Gary Andrew commented, “After three
tough meets, the guys are excited about conference, and they should be ready after a week and a half of
tapering down.” Gibson was optimistic about the team’s prospects as well, noting, “We have the potential to place very high
in the conference this year, but ‘potential’ only means that we haven’t proven ourselves yet. But it only takes one
race, and I’m confident that we’ll be ready to go on Saturday.”

Freshmen drive golf team

October has been a busy month for the Davidson men’s golf team. The Wildcats made an early-month trip to UNC
Wilmington for the River Landing Intercollegiates, then spent the following weekend in Signal Mountain, Tenn., competing in the Chattanooga Intercollegiate
Golf Classic. On October 8-9 the Wildcats put up a fight on the River Landing Country Club’s 6,975-yard course. Junior
Ben Friedell led the team with a final 224, eight over par for the course. Friedell placed 18th overall in
the tournament and was accompanied by Dan Koernke ’05, who finished with a 225 and earned 21st place. Other top
finishers for the Wildcats were sophomore Jon Kropski (231), freshman Joe Zimmerman (241), and senior captain Dan Carlson (244). The
’Cats took 12th place overall in the field of 18 teams. Old Dominion captured first, followed by host UNC Wilmington.
According to Carlson, “the most exciting part of the past [two] weekends has been the play of the freshmen.” This
“exciting” freshman play was apparent at the Chattanooga tournament, October 15-16 when freshmen Zimmerman and Koernke led the ’Cats to
an eighth-place finish against 18 teams. Zimmerman fired a one-under 205, tying for 11th place overall. The next Wildcat on
the board, Koernke, tied for 20th with a 217. Also placing was Friedell, shooting 220 to finish 29th. Kropski and
Carlson rounded out Davidson’s top five. The team’s total score came to 878 on Signal Mountain’s 6,095-yard course. The fall
season ended with the Chattanooga tournament, but the ’Cats are eager to open their spring season on February 18 at
the Charleston Southern Spring Kick-off Classic. Looking ahead to the upcoming season, Carlson said, “We're all ready to work hard
over the next few months so we're ready to go when the season starts again.”
