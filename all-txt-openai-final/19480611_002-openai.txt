LOCAT

Published weekly by the VHCA BOOKS - $10.03 AD $10 crousn
Editor Jack P. Etheridge - Dr. Chalmers G. Davidson has
Assistants Larry McLean announced that the LIBRARY would
Joe Vance observe the hours of 10 - 12 A.M.,
and 2 - 10 P.M. daily. Librarian

Davidson, Custodian of the local
Castle of Culture, also added that
Saturday afternoon hours would be
until 6 P.M. only. Books may be
checked out at any time that the
library is open.

The BOOK SOC will be open
each day, Monday through Friday,
from 9:15 to 9:45 A.M., and from
3:00 to 3:45 P.M.
Books for all courses are
available here, as are paper, pencils, notebooks, and other school
equipment.

Perhaps a word of explanation
and introduction to the LOCAT
is in order here in this, its first
appearance. The BOOK SOC will be open

In the first place, we desire
for this to be an interesting, informative, and perhaps sometimes
humorous publication. It is our hope
that you will make it so. Since
there are no literary requirements
to stifle the budding author here,
it makes little difference to the
LOCAT about the what, where, or
when of a news article. If you've
got a good story, or a bit of news,
or even a beef about something, we
want it, and want it expressed
in the LOCAT.

The nature of Summer School
is such that oftentimes there is
no opportunity to have announcements
made public when desired, or lost
books, etc., inquired for. One of
the chief functions of the LOCAT
then shall be to serve as a medium
for announcements, lost and found
articles, and things of that nature.

The LOCAT is in great need of
a few men who will volunteer to
serve as typists and to serve on
the feature staff so that we can
more effectively get the news "hot
off the press," and have it presented as neatly and as accurately as
possible. If you find it possible
to help, please see the editor or
Bill McLean.

The LOCAT is financed and
sponsored by your CA. It is intended as another student service,
and we urgently desire the benefit
of your criticism and suggestions.

VESPER SUNDAY

CA GARDEN

Professor and Mrs. Robert
Noehren sailed from Norfolk June 8
for Antwerp, and thence to France,
where Prof. Noehren will spend some
seven weeks in study of the 18th
Century French organ. During their
stay in Europe, the Noehrens will
visit several countries, including
England and Belgium, where Professor
Noehren will give two organ recitals.
The intensive study carried on
by Prof. Noehren is done under a
Carnegie Foundation Fellowship.
Mr. Noehren is considered one of
the outstanding organists in the
country.

STORE HOURS

In accordance with its policy
of getting the first news first,
the LOCAT announces the hours of
the Student Store, received in a
private interview. It was reported
exclusively to this paper that the
Store will not be open for business
on Sunday. It will, however, accommodate its genteel clientele on the
following hours during the week:
7:15 to 10:15 A.M., 3:00 to 6:30 P.M.,
and 8:00 to 11:00 P.M.
