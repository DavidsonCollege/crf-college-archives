A. C. P. CONVENTION
LARGEST IN HISTORY

The largest Associated Collegiate Press convention in the history of the organization was held in the Brown Hotel at Louisville, Ky., recently. More than 275 delegates from thirty-three states were in attendance.

Famed speakers who addressed the many roundtable and general sessions included John B. Kennedy, NBC commentator and former associate editor of Collier's; Herbert Agar, associate editor of The Louisville Courier-Journal; Dusty Miller, publisher of the Wilmington (Ohio) News-Journal; George Brandenburg, of Editor and Publisher, and many others. Summaries of the important talks and roundtables will be presented in the Press Review and Business Review in succeeding issues.

Convention host was the University of Louisville, and the local chairman in charge of the arrangements and program was R. E. Blackwell, the assistant to the president of that institution.

MANY ANSWER FOOTBALL

The purpose of this early start in training is so that when the squad is called out next month the men will be ready to start scrimmage immediately, and in this way a great deal more will be accomplished during the six-week outdoor practice this spring.

Practice will officially commence the first Monday after examinations. This practice, including weekly scrimmages, will continue for six weeks.

New President Reviews History of Society in Inaugural Address

Installation of new officers was the main feature of the meeting of the Philanthropic Society held Tuesday, Jan. 12. Brad Reed, new president of the group, delivered his inaugural address. Reed briefly reviewed the history of the society and made proposals for an active future.

Lindsey spoke on the methods of the famous French detective force, the Surete.
