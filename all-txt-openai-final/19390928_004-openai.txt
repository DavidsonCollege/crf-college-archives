( N SS ideline idelights By ANDY DALE Davidson Sports| ’Cats Play Rose Bowl Dukes Sat. In First Home Game THURSDAY, SEPT. 28, 1939 THE DAVIDSONIAN Page Four Conference FOOTBALL OUTLOOK BRIGHTENS Hopes of Wildcat football fans rose considerably last Saturday night in Greensboro as Davidson passed State dizzy in the third quarter, and lost only by a heart-breaking touchdown pass in the late fourth period. With junior Granville Sharpe settling down to business after a shaky start, the ‘Cats brought the stands to their collective feet as Sharpe fired passes to Hackney and Cowan for two touchdowns, to which Stan Yoder added the points. Sharpe's aerial bombs almost won the game at the end as Davidson made a sustained drive on passes to the State 15-yard stripe short. With three more plays, Davidson could have scored again, but we'll never know that. Blocking on passes looked especially good Saturday night, and time and again Sharpe stood surrounded by an inner wall of blockers, holding State men at bay outside as Granville prepared to toss. His passes constantly improved, and were hitting their mark like an arrow late in the game. This offensive weapon will prove invaluable against all teams, but especially the bigger ones.

LINESMEN LOOK GOOD

The entire Davidson line played a bang-up game, although heavily outweighed. Especially notable was the way big “Ty” Coon, crashing State tackle, was held in check almost all night. Although the ‘Cats hit his side of the line rarely, he wasn’t able to block punts or passes, a thing unusual for him. Opposite Coon was in there all the way, putting out a fine game, his first as a starter. Elmer Knoeller, over at the other tackle post, also looked good in his debut as a Varsity performer. Although knocked breathless, he stayed in and showed great promise. Bob Johnson, another of last year’s reserves, came through at his guard position, getting through for many tackles, and generally doing his share. Gales McClintock played a fine defensive game, besides making some nice snags of passes. He and Cowan teamed to give Sharpe good targets most of the time.

Rooney and Pavlovsky were State's offensive stars. Rooney was, as usual, their triple threat man, and he is a real threat at all times. Pavlovsky churned the center territory with ripping line smashes, but was stopped again and again by Yoder and McLean, backing up the line. Rooney found considerable trouble skirting the ends as his interferers were unable to turn the 'Cats in and allow him to get around. The State backfield seemed also to have some trouble with their deceptive plays, as momentary fumbles slowed them down several times. Davidson reeled off some nice yardage on reverses with Hand and Hackney taking the ball. Those deceptive plays should be a help against bigger teams, where they will scatter those power-ridden lines and enable Davidson's “scat-backs” to scoot through.

Looking back over the game, one’s mind can’t help but think that when a team can spot another twenty pounds to the man on the average, and still play them evenly, that team is well able to take care of itself. This is the kind of team that will be underdogs, but that can still pull upsets and come within a very short distance of doing that to State. Those State footballers and their fans will remember that game quite a while.

LET’S SHOW DUKE.

Davidson's Wildcats, with a disheartening 18-14 defeat by North Carolina State’s Wolfpack behind them, will oppose the mighty Blue Devils of Duke University Saturday afternoon at Richardson Field. Minus five of last year’s “Seven Iron Dukes,” including All-American Dan Hill at center, Duke will not present the great defensive team which enabled them to go through the entire season unscored upon, only to lose out in the Rose Bowl on a long pass into the end zone. With Captain Pea Johnson and Frank Ribar, both veteran 195 pounders, at guard, Winterson and Ruffa at the tackle posts, “Bolo” Perdue and Bailey at ends, the Blue Devils will be no pushovers defensively. The center position will be in the hands of Burns, 190 pound understudy of Hill for the past two seasons.

However, Coach Wallace Wade has been drilling the Dukes in offensive play, attempting to put the excellent backfield material at hand to the best use. Veterans from last year are threatened with loss of their jobs to a brilliant group of sophomores. Winston Siegfried, powerful sophomore from Richmond, and Steve Lach, 195 pound wingback, appear to be the pick of the newcomers.

McAfee Main Threat

The main offensive threat is expected to be George McAfee. “Gorgeous George,” as he is known, was out most of last season with various injuries. George is expected to team with his younger brother, Wesley, in giving the Dukes a real offense. Back again to carry on where they left off last year are Willard Eaves and “Jap” Davis, both great blockers. Despite the loss of Eric Tipton and Dan Hill, the Blue Devils are once again to be counted on as a power in the South and the team to beat in the Southern Conference.

Kits Prepare For Schedule

Davidson's freshman football team, under the direction of coaches Little and Shepard, is rapidly rounding into shape for their opening game with the strong Carolina Frosh, on October the sixth. Due to the fact of many inexperienced men, the first few days have been given over to the fundamental points of the game. However, coaches Little and Shepard are confident that they will make a good showing throughout the schedule. Several of the men are looking good in practice, but there is a fight for every position and the starting team has not been selected as yet. However, Frederick, Long, and Lacey are looking good in the backfield, with Rainey, Moorehead, Washborn, and Grosse showing up well in the line. The team this year will be lighter than the team of last year. Coach Little expects to make up what the team lacks in weight with speed and deception. As a whole, the team is well-balanced, with enough reserve strength to make them a real threat.

Teams Open Grid Season

Teams Swing Into Action This Week; Devils Favored In Conference Again.

Duke’s Rose Bowl Blue Devils, despite the fact that they have not seen action this season, are heavily favored by the critics to cop both Southern Conference and Big Five loops. Although expected to be a little weaker on defense, the Devils' offensive power should be stronger. An impressive 50-0 win over Citadel last Saturday in their opening game, the Tar Heels from North Carolina showed a powerful passing and running attack. A strong Wake Forest eleven will put the Carolina boys through a real test next Saturday. The Deacons opened by crushing Elon, 34-0, and then taking South Carolina 19-7 last week. Clemson scored an 18-0 win over Presbyterian College in their opener. The Tigers travel this week to New Orleans to meet Tulane. N.C. State, after barely eking out a win over Davidson in Greensboro last Saturday night, meet their supreme test when they tangle with the Tennessee Vols. Duke visits the Davidson campus this week for the annual meeting of these two Big Five schools. This will be the opening game for the Dukes and the first home game for the ‘Cats. Furman’s squad travels to West Point to meet the Army.

Barracks __ __ __ Pegram, C.**White, J. Harriers Hold Practice Runs**

With one of the largest squads to report for practice, the prospects for a cross-country team are very bright. Led by three lettermen of last year, Captain Dick Gammon, Eldridge Brown, and Bob Kellogg, the harriers have been put through their paces for the last several days by Coach Heath Whittle. Several sophomores from last year’s crack Freshman team are expected to help fill the places left vacant by the graduation of Boo Walker and Dave Woodard. The following are out for the cross-country team: Captain Dick Gammon, Eldridge Brown, Bob Kellogg, Hollis, Colvin, Gilliam, Parish, Barker, Pardee, Mann, Talmadge, Coppedge, Washburn, Watt, and Lemmon.

**Cake Race**

With the holding of the annual Freshman cake race Tuesday, Coach Whittle plans to find likely prospects from which to build his Freshman cross-country team. Several Freshmen have been seen running the course and rumors are that it will be a fast race. Prizes given by the boarding houses and business firms will be awarded to approximately the first thirty boys crossing the finish line.

The 1939 Varsity schedule is as follows:
- Oct. 4—Duke (here)
- Oct. 21—U.N.C. (Chapel Hill)
- Oct. 28—W. and L. (here)
- Nov. 4—N.C. State (tentative)
- Nov. 11—Guilford
- Nov. 18—Open
- Nov. 25—Southern Conference (Chapel Hill)

**Burlington Ace Pass In Last Period**

Granville Sharpe, 158-pound Davidson tailback, has been the mainstay of the Wildcat offense. Graduating from last year’s B team, Sharpe has developed rapidly both in running and passing. Sharpe is extremely light for his important position as triple-threat man, but he has great drive in his legs. His accurate passing in the North Carolina State game garnered two touchdowns for the Wildcats and kept the State defense wide open.

**N.C. State 18-14 Decision Over Cats**

Wolfpack Scores Twice in First Half; Davidson Unleashes Air Attack To Take Lead, Then Loses On Last Quarter Pass By Rooney

By BOB McLEOD

**Passes Click For Davidson**

Davidson's Wildcats opened the 1939 season by dropping a last-minute decision to N.C. State’s Wolfpack last Saturday night in Greensboro’s Memorial Stadium by the score of 18-14. Although making more first downs than State, 9 to 8, the Wildcats were defeated in their opening game on Saturday night. Davidson's forward wall, although outweighed, continually outfought the big State linesmen and caused the Wolfpack to take to the air to score all of their touchdowns.

Davidson’s passing attack, with Sharpe doing the throwing, was the outstanding offensive weapon of the 'Cats' attack. Pavlovsky occasionally hit the Wildcat line for good gains, but the 'Pack's best weapon was the deadly passing of Artie Rooney.

**State Recovers Fumble**

On the Wildcats’ first play, Sharpe fumbled and the ball was recovered by State on the 18-yard line. After three failed line plays to gain, Rooney dropped back and passed to Fehley, who caught it in the end zone for State's first touchdown. Their second six-pointer came shortly before the end of the half on a 47-yard pass from Rooney to Dick East that climaxed a drive from their own 42. Rooney missed both placement tries, giving the Wolfpack a 12 to 0 lead as the half ended.

Soon after the second half opened, the Wildcats’ passing attack began to click. Two long passes, Sharpe to McClintock, and Sharpe to Cowan, who lateraled to Bolin, put the ball on the State 15. After Yoder had bucked the ball to the 9, Sharpe pitched a fourth-down pass to Claude Hackney for the 'Cats' first touchdown. After an exchange of punts, Sharpe from his own 38-yard line tossed a pass to Footsie Cowan, who caught the ball on the State 46, spun out of Fehley’s hands, and ran the remaining distance for the 'Cats' second score. Yoder made both conversions, giving Davidson a 14 to 12 lead.

**State Wins On Pass**

Shortly after the last stanza opened, State began a drive from their own 31 which terminated in a 28-yard pass, Rooney to Sullivan, for the game’s fifth aerial touchdown.

**East and Rumple Win As Intramurals Start**

Inter-dormitory competition began Monday with games played between East and Georgia, Barracks and Rumple. The East-Georgia game soon developed into a rout. Early in the game, Frank Hall recovered a Georgia fumble behind the goal line for a touchdown. Georgia fought back down the field and finally scored on a pass over the goal from “Hayseed” Thomas to Benny Harrison. East came right back and tallied on a toss from Dick Winters to Vanlandingham. The feature of the game came in the last quarter when Winters intercepted a pass on the five-yard line and dashed 95 yards for a score.

**Rumple Wins**

Rumple was led to victory by two members of the freshman class. When the game was scarcely five minutes old, “Red” Sherrill fired a long pass to Lacy McLean for the only tally of the game. Despite the efforts of Jack White and Roger Rice, the Barracks boys were able to make only two first downs and never really threatened the Rumple lead. The highlight of the struggle was Rice’s headfirst dive over the steep bank in pursuit of an erring pass.

**New System Starts**

This year marks the beginning of the inter-dormitory competition, replacing inter-class rivalry. Judging from the interest shown in Monday's games, Pete Whittle’s idea will be a success.

**Home Games To Go On Air**

Station WSOC in Charlotte has made arrangements to broadcast the Wildcat games to be played in Richardson Stadium this season. The local National Broadcasting System station has gone to some expense to run their own lines into the field press-box. Paul Norris, veteran of the airways, will announce the actual play. Norris is known throughout the South for his vivid description of plays as they take place. George Brenzel, long associated with the Inter-collegiate Radio Council, will make observations on the game during the time-outs and between the halves. He will also describe the movements of the Davidson band.
