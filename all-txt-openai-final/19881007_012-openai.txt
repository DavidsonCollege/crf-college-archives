Davidsonian deadlines when they do not see their articles in print for another week. That was the basic scenario last
week as the Tuesday 5 PM deadline became a Monday issue. Furthermore, with such mismanagement, all the news/sports/features are archaic.
Who wants to read a story about a football game that happened ten days ago or a review of a
film they already saw?

Secondly, the personal attacks made on Mr. Ed Powell and Mr. Richard Jones were, at least, unprofessional. They were, at
most, libel. Not only did this newspaper openly ridicule two writers, but it did so totally out of context, especially
in Mr. Jones’ case. As a result of his showing interest enough to write a letter to the editor, he
received in return an assault that he was unable to defend against. This kind of behavior abuses journalistic license. Also,
it seems quite inconsistent to complain about the dearth of writers, then openly criticize those who do contribute. Hence, last
week’s editorial page was a study in illogic.

I realize that the editor will read my letter before it goes into print, and he will be able to
take my arguments out of context as he did Mr. Jones’. As a result, I am using the spell-checker immediately
after finishing this letter. I apologize to both Mr. Powell and Mr. Jones for this newspaper’s unprofessional actions.

Sincerely,
Hap Bryant, sports editor

Submitting my letter with spelling errors included is a violation of The Davidsonian editorial policy. Furthermore, it is a cheap
shot. The Davidsonian belongs to the people of Davidson College. It is not the sole property of the news staff.
My first letter intends not to libel any member of the news staff, but it calls on students to submit
quality over quantity, prose over space-filler to their Davidsonian. We, as a whole, are capable of a better publication. The
purpose of my first letter made clear, I will contend with most of your remaining criticisms.

First, The Washington Post is an international daily of, roughly, 160 pages (double that number on Sunday). Comparing The Davidsonian
to The Washington Post is like comparing The Little Engine That Could to War and Peace.

VOMIT, from page 10

Everyone should have learned in kindergarten that if you make a mess, then you should clean it up. Obviously, this
partier did not attend kindergarten. Since the person was unable to find the toilet, he or she was clearly too
sick to clean up the disgusting mess. We understand this. But that person could have respected the inhabitants of the
hall enough to remove the mess the following morning, before all the inhabitants had the pleasure to experience it. Instead,
this person did not accept the consequences of his or her actions. So the rest of us had to walk
in and smell vomit for two days. And even worse, the janitor, John Houston, had to clean up for one
partier's irresponsibility. Is this fair? Is it really in the janitor's job description to clean up two-day-old vomit because one
of us was too good to clean it up? If students do not inflict the consequences of this partying so
blatantly, and disgustingly, upon your fellow Davidson community members. This is not the first time it has happened here, and
Watts is not the only dorm in which it has occurred. Will it be the last time?

The Davidsonian needs to be chock full of the best print available. Second, the quality of the prose found in
the Georgia State Signal surpasses The Davidsonian. Granted, Georgia State has a larger student body and a larger news staff.
But, if The Davidsonian is the product of a selective institution, then how does one justify a far superior student
paper from a school where the median SAT is 950?

Third, Hunter S. Thompson is an icon, someone with whom somebody can identify. Personal taste aside, evoking Thompson corresponds with
the first letter’s call for controversial yet insightful journalism. Perhaps, I should have made the reference to George Will. Nevertheless,
the final paragraph of your reply, aside from the fact it is a bitter attack on my personal integrity and
is in bad taste (you have an excellent career ahead writing for Bob Guccione), is well written. The paragraph has
a clear, even style with brilliant use of modifiers. Therefore, my task moves to its fruition. I have enjoyed the
challenge of retorting and I hope we may continue the dialogue on any subject of your choosing. Maybe, someday, with
your gentle prodding, I will count myself among the virtually literate.

Richard C. Jones
