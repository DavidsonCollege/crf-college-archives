**Spirit Square in Charlotte**

If you missed *The Matchmaker* last weekend, you have a second chance to enjoy the Davidson Drama Department's spring production.
This amusing farce by Thornton Wilder will be presented in Spirit Square on Friday and Saturday nights (May 2-3) at
8:15 p.m.

Also on Saturday, for the young at heart, the Tarradiddle Players will present Flora Atkin’s *Dig and Tell* at 2:00
p.m. The gist of this play is an entertaining expedition to the Middle East.

Then on Tuesday (May 6), at 8:15 p.m., Richard Marshall will appear with Victoria Grof. Grof, a New York City
Opera mezzo-soprano, will be accompanied by pianist Marshall, of the Charlotte Opera.

Ticket prices: *The Matchmaker*—$4.00; *Dig and Tell*—$2.00; Marshall and Grof—$5.00. For information call 376-8883.

**Dance Troupe**

The New Reflections Dance Troupe, scheduled to appear here on May 1, has cancelled their engagement. So it goes.

**Speakers Committee Chairman**

There will be interviews Tuesday night for a new Union Speakers Committee Chairman. The present holder of that position, Mike
Cooper, has decided to go JYA next year and hence the opening. Sign up at the Union desk before Tuesday
if you think you're interested.

**Ugly Man On Campus**

The annual selection of the Ugly Man on Campus will begin this week. Boxes will be placed around campus for
nominations, which will close on Friday. Then, on Tuesday, the five or six nominees with the most nominations will have
a runoff election. Each candidate will have a jar, and votes are a penny apiece.

All proceeds will go to APO, Davidson's service fraternity, for charitable use.

**Current Events Discussion**

Want to express your opinions on global and national affairs? The weekly Current Events Discussion Group has been reinstated, providing
all with a place to argue their points with other adamant souls. Organized mainly by students, the weekly discussion group
is meeting Thursday evenings in the Center for Special Studies, and only interest is necessary to keep the practice up
into the coming year.

The topic tonight (May 1) is “Iran, the Middle East, and the U.S.: Should Billy be president or send in
the Israelis?” The discussion will get started around 6:45; anyone is welcome.

**Jazz Ensemble And Spring Dance**

The Jazz Ensemble will be making two appearances as a group this weekend, as a finish to the year. Friday
night (May 2) the stage band will be in the 900 Room at 10:30 playing everybody’s favorite tunes, as they
have done successfully in times past.

Then, for the first time in recent memory, the Jazz Ensemble will play for the Spring Dance to be held
in Chambers Gallery on Saturday, May 3 (9:30 p.m.—1 a.m.). The theme of the dance will be the “Big Band”
sound of Glenn Miller and his contemporaries. The dance will be accompanied by pianist Marshall of the Charlotte Opera.

Presented by the Music Department and the Union Dance Committee, admission is $1.50 per couple, $1.00 per person.
