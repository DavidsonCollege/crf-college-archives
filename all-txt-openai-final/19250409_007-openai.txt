Walker; three-base hits: Crutchfield, Vance; sacrifice hits: Lindley, Covington (2), Simpson; base on balls: off Pogleman 1, off Oden 1;
struck out: by Pogleman 5, by Oden 5; left on bases: Elon 2, Davidson 3; double plays: Caddell to Slaughter
to Lindley; S. Alford, unassisted; hit by pitched ball: Wrenn (by Pogleman); earned runs: Elon 0, Davidson 1; time: 1:42;
umpire: TaN. In the second game Elon won out in what promised to be an interesting game at first, but
later was ruined by many errors. The game started off with a bang when Vance slammed out a triple with
one man on, which turned into a homer when the fielder fumbled the ball. Elon scored in the third when
Oden threw a couple of wild ones to first. Four more tallies were scored in the sixth after two men
were out. A walk, an error, a double and a triple accounted for these scores. Another was marked up in
the ninth when an error was made at short. Vance made two of Davidson's seven hits in his four trips
to the platter. This kept his average up to .564 out of 16 times at bat. Both pitchers showed real
stuff but were afforded poor support by the teams. Davidson earned one of her runs while Elon did not earn
any, the Davidson boys allowing scores to come in on errors, seven in all being chalked up against them. The
