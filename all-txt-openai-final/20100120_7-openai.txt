Republicans Bring Back What

Boston, Massachusetts — Voters
and media alike are in a frenzy
after a nude centerfold of U.S.
Senator-Elect Scott Brown recently
surfaced. While the Massachusetts
politician is not shying away from
his past exploits, many analysts see
this ploy as a return to earlier Re-
publican campaign tactics.
“Traditionally, Republican can-
didates have flaunted their bodies
in the hopes to win various cam-
paigns. From Taft to Eisenhower,
many of our most famous and suc-
cessful politicians have posed nude
to help bolster popularity. Nothing
says low taxes like ripped abs,”
said Robert Bledsole, a member of
the Woodrow Wilson Institute for
Scholars, a think tank in Washing-
ton, DC.
Republicans have long embraced
their dashing good looks in attempts
to counter the Democrats, using
a toned, sexy core as a rebuttal
against claims of a lack of scruples.
“They have taken the Democratic
criticism in stride and the confi-
dence they display while baring
themselves is making a huge impact
on the voting public. It is a brilliant
move politically,” Bledsole said.
By the 1940s the tactic was
commonplace; this 1948 campaign
poster contributed to a blowout win
of a number of seats in the House.
However, with the changing face of
politics and the increasing number
of female politicians, the “Saucy
GOP” movement fell out of style.
The Neo-conservative movement,
which put clothes back on all of
its public figures, blossomed in
the early 1980s, though extremists
on the far-right still criticized Bob
Dole for keeping his pants on dur-
ing all of his press conferences.

Clearly Brown is making a bold
move and trying to bring back a
sexier, edgier side of American
politics, celebrating the beauty of
the male form and the benefits of
a full-time gym membership. The
selection of Gov. Sarah Palin as
the Republican Vice Presidential
Candidate two years ago was a bold
move, but it didn’t pay off.

“The female side of it is harder
to control,” Bledsole explained.

Scott Brown: “Do you really
think I have to stoop for some
underage Congressional page
with a body like this?”

William “Ladykiller” H. Taft

Brown represents a revival of a
classic Republican campaign prac-
tice of appearing in risqué photos.
The most famous incident in the
tradition involved the publication of
Playgirl photos of William Howard
Taft, released right before the 1908
election came to a close. While
women could not vote at the time,
the photos won over rising gay
populations in Southern California,
San Francisco and Massachusetts.
Engravings and Daguerreotypes
of a scantily-clad Ulysses S. Grant
circulated before his election.

“A beautiful woman makes people
nervous, and therefore more prone
to taking offense. But think about
Michelangelo’s David—if a dude
dares to let it all dangle, it becomes
one of the most treasured objects in
the world.”

The Democratic Party has yet to
respond to this new, sexy assault.
Rumors that Bill Clinton was being
called out of retirement to “bring
sexy back” to the left have not been
confirmed, though an inside source
did confirm that Monica Lewinski
has been hired on as a consultant. A
White House representative also an-
nounced that new wardrobes were
being developed for the Obamas,
with “more muscle shirts for Barack
and some skanky halter tops for
Michelle and the girls.”

Not-So-Wild-Anymore-Cat Reflects
on Crazy Youth

The Wildcat Den—In his first
advice to current students. The
wisdom and maturity he now pos-
sesses, he claims, have shown him
the pleasures of a slower, calmer
routine than the “life in the fast
lane” he led at one of America’s
most notorious party campuses.

The Wildcat, or Mildcat, as he
now prefers to be called, arrived at
Davidson in 1971, two years before
women were allowed to enroll.
“Things were pretty crazy before
the chicks got here,” he said. “You
didn’t have to worry as much about
embarrassing yourself, although
the midnight raids we took down to
Queen’s College in Charlotte were
always a good time.”

The Mildcat was enrolled at
Davidson as a student for a decade
before dropping out, but has held
various odd jobs around campus
for the past 29 years anyway. His
unbridled enthusiasm and school
spirit made him forever welcome at
Davidson, despite his struggles with
drug and gambling addiction. “I
would steal paper from the Library
printers and sell it to pay my dealer.
I would break into Commons at
night because I couldn’t afford a
meal plan, or I gambled away all
my Bonus Bucks. Those were dark
days.”

The Mildcat says the loving sup-
port of his longtime girlfriend and
now fiancée, Lula Bell Houston,
helped him fight through his addic-
tions and become a stable, produc-
tive member of the Davidson com-
munity.

“It’s been great to watch the
school develop as it has,” he said
before looking over his shoulder
and whispering, “I have to say,
though...the best part is, I get older,
but freshmen girls...they just stay
the same age.”
