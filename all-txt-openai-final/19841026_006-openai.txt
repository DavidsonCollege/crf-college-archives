Committee Anticipates Drinking Age Changes

(continued from page 1)

"...endorse the idea behind the law [pertaining to drinking and driving] and inform the students,” Brown said. “We need to see where the limits of the law are and what the consequences will be,” he added. Because the legal ramifications for the College are unclear, the Committee has asked a lawyer to speak at the next meeting. “We need to know who would be responsible if, for example, someone were charged [by police] at a campus eating house,” Brown said. “There are a lot of questions about what is legal and what’s not,” Brown added.

Brown does not foresee a recommendation to the College of policing the law. “We do think the College would do well to support the spirit of the law,” Brown said, “but I would be surprised if they recommended that we [the College] become agents of the police force.” He feels that the main responsibility of the College “is to get students to think about their patterns concerning drinking and driving,” he said. “We don’t want students to get into trouble [with the law] over it. We want a solution which will make a happier environment.”

Terry agreed that the aim of any change in College policy would be ways to discourage drinking and driving. Terry said the group should consider whether a heavy anti-alcohol program by the College would drive parties off-campus, thus putting students on the highways. Nevertheless, he feels that the College should take a stand on the issue. “The College can’t espouse breaking the law,” Terry said.

Houses Formulate Alcohol, Drug Policies

Carolina drinking laws. Neither Warner Hall nor Emanon have formulated specific alcohol policies. According to Warner Hall president Ross Thayer, Terry’s letter requested a drug and/or alcohol policy, “and I took it...

Disciplinary Procedure

Lean. The current Code of Responsibility and Code of Disciplinary Procedure was designed in 1971. According to Terry, it has undergone minor revisions. Changes have included the section which now allows the Dean to waive holidays, weekends, and vacations in the time permitted to investigate a complaint of an honor violation and sign the charges, Terry said. The time frame of the review process was shortened by five days, Terry added.

Another change, in which Terry said there occurred “quite a little debate about,” involved the suspension procedure. The code underwent changes so that the offender’s suspension would include the term in which the violation occurred. Terry said the two-term minimum sanction came about at this time, since a one-term suspension could put the violator back on campus within weeks of the violation, if it had occurred near the end of the term. The two-term minimum suspension is an agreement between himself and the Honor Council rather than a guideline outlined in the procedure, Terry said.

The most recent change, according to Terry, took place in the addition of a hearing to determine a student’s sanction if the Honor Council returns a guilty verdict. This change came about, Terry said, because honor hearings, which only consider...evidence directly related to the charge, often overlooked mitigating circumstances that might merit a reduced sanction.

to mean two separate policies.” Thayer said the PCC decided to concentrate on house drug policies now, and not require a specific alcohol policy until later. Emanon president Sid Jones said Emanon has no alcohol problem which would require a specific policy. “We don’t see it as a problem,” he said. The drug policies of Court houses generally include fines to house members for possession or use of illegal drugs at the house or at a house function. Emanon imposes a $50 fine for a first offense and expulsion from the house for a second offense, according to Jones. Warner Hall imposes a $75 fine for a first offense, and PAX and Sigma Alpha Epsilon have fines of $100, according to house representatives. Most houses have no measures for a second offense. Thayer said Warner Hall has no such stipulation because it has not had much of a problem with drugs in the past, and house members do not foresee one in the future. According to Kappa Alpha Order president Tony Holt, KA’s drug policy contains no particular punishments, but simply states that no illegal substances such as drugs will be allowed in the house.
