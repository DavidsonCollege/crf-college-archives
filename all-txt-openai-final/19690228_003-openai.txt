**HELPS DISADVANTAGED STEP Means Involvement**

By JIM PHILLIPS

Three years ago the Student Tutorial Education Program was born at Davidson. From the plans laid by three Davidson students,
Mike Norris, Marvin Sparrow, and Jordie Lang, the program has grown to include some 120 Davidson students and tutees. The
tutees, about three-fourths Negroes, are in the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades in the Davidson area. Each is paired with
a participating Davidson student who tries to help him with his work and get to know him well. The primary
goal of the tutor-tutee relationship is to improve the tutee’s self-image through contact with a person in whom he can
confide. In seeking to do this, the tutor tries to avoid cut-and-dried academic techniques. The tutor tries to teach effective
language and mathematics skills by using methods far more creative and more individually tailored than those possible in the classroom.

“As it happened,” said STEP Director Robert Pyeatt, “the local schools were integrated three years ago, too. We found that
a number of children, both black and white, were starting behind and getting further and further behind. They were culturally
disadvantaged and having difficulties with such fundamentals as reading.” The local schools have been very receptive to the program. “Many
of the school officials have indicated a change in attitude among the STEP students,” commented Pyeatt, “and ideally that’s part
of the goal of the program to improve the student's self-image... his self-concept... to let him know he can succeed.”

Both Pyeatt and Randy Phillips, coordinator of the tutorial program, have expressed the belief that the program has been very
worthwhile. However, Phillips warned about becoming too complacent about the program. “I would like to see the program get more
involved in the community,” he said. Right now it seems to be “out of touch with the community to some
extent. It’s just something the college does,” he added.

Last spring, the STEP executive committee began work on a proposed five-year plan to bring a number of members of
low-income and minority groups to Davidson. Right now this matter rests with the Extra-Campus Responsibilities Commission. “Presently we are working
with the West Davidson Teen Center on Friday and Saturday nights at the Negro United Presbyterian Church,” added Pyeatt.

Students involved in tutoring disadvantaged students were unanimous in saying that the experience has broadened their outlook on the nature
of the problems faced by the students they teach. “Personally, I found the program to be very rewarding,” said Phillips,
“and there can be no doubt that there have been significant numbers of students and tutees educated by the program.”
Pyeatt injected, “It gives you some idea of what it’s like to be poor and black in the South.”

Davidson’s STEP program has received wide acclaim since its inception three years ago. It is to be the subject of
an in-depth study in the Charlotte Observer in the near future. In addition to the tutorial sessions, STEP conducts a
“Perspectives on Poverty” seminar, which seeks to examine the problem of poverty in the United States in general and the
town of Davidson in particular. The seminar is student-run and student-organized, with participants from the faculty and student body. The
seminar is designed to create within the participants an awareness of the problem of poverty as it affects the individual
who is poor in a wealthy country. The seminar has a highly flexible format including speakers and individual study.

**Symposium Stresses Cause Of Intellectual Involvement**

By MARK HODGES

Stimulus and the Great Issues Symposium are the YMCA’s contributions to campus intellectual life. The purpose of the annual symposium,
to be held this year on March 24-25, is to present several guest speakers, each an expert on a particular
question of broad student interest. And Stimulus, a student-faculty project that lasts all year, tries to get to the heart
of vital discussion topics.

The Great Issues Symposium is an innovation in the extra-curricular program of the college. The idea behind the program, according
to Chairman Ken Crews, is to bring to Davidson “the type of person who serves as an outside-the-classroom experience.” This
year’s speakers, for instance, are a pair of politicians, and Crews said, “We hope they will excite some interest in
government and governmental problems.” This year's subject is the direction of the American political parties, and the speakers are to
be John J. Gilligan and Rep. Donald Riegle, R-Mich. Gilligan served as a Democratic representative to Congress from Ohio from
1964 to 1966 and was an unsuccessful candidate for the Senate in 1968. In his senatorial campaign, he stressed the
problems of the urban crisis and argued that the United States must develop new foreign policies relevant to “today's realities.”
A liberal, he is considered by many the leader of the Democratic party in Ohio.

Riegle, 31, is the youngest member of Congress ever to serve on the powerful House Appropriations Committee. He is one
of five young Congressmen spotlighted in Newsweek as political “comers” in the 1970s and he was selected as one of
10 outstanding young men in the U.S. in 1968. A Republican, he has been a prominent critic of the United
States’ conduct of the Vietnam war. Gilligan and Riegle will speak in Love Auditorium on March 25 at 8 p.m.
Each will make a 25-minute presentation on developments in their respective parties, then jointly they will conduct a question and
answer session.

During the afternoon and evening before their Love Auditorium presentation, Gilligan and Riegle will meet with small groups of students
from Davidson, Queens, Salem, and Johnson C. Smith. Crews said he hoped close contact with such successful young political figures
would “awaken all of us to the possibilities of the future because of the example of their success.” They “demonstrate
that there are still ways to solve problems from within the establishment,” he said.

Though this year’s symposium deals with politics, Crews pointed out that a different area of interest is highlighted each year.
The symposium will be broadened next year, Crews said. He said that planning this program is “year-round work” and that
the committee hopes to start work earlier for next year’s symposium. The principal idea for next year is to increase
the number of speakers to four or six. This will give more students the opportunity to come into personal contact
with outstanding men, Crews said. The symposium program at Davidson is modeled after the Wake Forest and Vanderbilt symposiums.

The other program, Stimulus, sponsors discussion groups on predefined issues. According to Charles Newton, head of Stimulus, the premises of
the program are (1) that discussion groups can broaden one’s educational experience by discussing vital issues with other people and
(2) that students don't take advantage of association with professors. Stimulus is an attempt to find a way around this
lack of meaningful association. Newton said that the leaders of Stimulus hoped to broaden this concept of meaningful association by
trying to arrange discussions between groups of black and white students.

There has been some faculty disenchantment with the Stimulus program this year. Some professors have said that the discussion groups
deal more with cafe intellectualism than serious scholarship. Newton said he felt that the Stimulus groups had a real educational
value, but he admitted that enthusiasm has been inconsistently shown by group leaders this year.

**North End YMCA Is Proposed; Are Our ‘Memberships’ Good?**

By DAVID GRISSETT
Staff Writer

The building of a branch of the Charlotte YMCA has been proposed for the North End of Mecklenburg County, i.e.,
Davidson, Cornelius, and Huntersville areas. The tri-town effort is headed by Robert T. Stone of Davidson, an insurance representative for
Northwestern Mutual Life, who hopes that the Davidson students and fraternities will support the membership drive. Approximately $25,000 will be
needed for the organization and programs of the YMCA. An additional $50,000 would be necessary to construct a building with
its own facilities. The building goal of next year will be dependent on the success of the charter membership drive.

Stone believes that current student memberships could be automatically transferred to the new branch. However, this policy of membership and
dues has not been ruled upon by the YMCA budget committee. A meeting is scheduled for tonight. Scott Woodmansee, chaplain
and adviser to the student YMCA, said that the student Y is just a part of the national organization; and
thus an additional, but possibly reduced, membership fee might be charged to students joining a community YMCA.OF THE YMCA AND
THROUGH IT WITH THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF THE YMCAS AND THE WORLD’S STUDENT CHRISTIAN FEDERATION THIS IS TO CERTIFY THAT
____________ A MEMBER (IN GOOD STANDING) FOR THE PERIOD ____________ GENERAL SECRETARY THIS CARD SERVES AS AN INTRODUCTION TO YMCAS
EVERYWHERE. THE USE OF PRIVILEGES HOWEVER IS SUBJECT TO LOCAL REGULATIONS.

At Davidson, students are automatically members of the student YMCA on campus. Anyone can pick up his membership card at
the Chaplain’s Office on the second floor of the Union. However, the campus YMCA does not send enough dues to
the national organization for the national to consider each student a member of the YMCA. Students are thus viewed as
members by the local campus Y, but are not viewed as members by the national YMCA. Of course, anyone who
contributed to the YMCA fund drive in October is a full-fledged member, even in the eyes of the national YMCA.

YMCA Reorients Policy Growth Toward Social Relevance

The YMCA is, of course, composed of people with varying focal interests and objectives. Any group so constituted directs itself
along the common interests of its members as determined by their personal motivation and their conception of the organization’s purpose.
The attraction of students to the YMCA program is a result of many factors, but the one most often cited
is the opportunity to take direct social action. But different students list many different reasons for becoming active in the
YMCA.

“The ‘Y’ gives students a chance to get involved at the grassroots, and to get done some things that they
want to get done rather than just talk about them,” said YMCA Vice President Greg Scott.

Steve Salyer, who left the Senate to become YMCA secretary, resigned so that he could work directly on such extra-classroom
educational programs as the Great Issues Symposium. Salyer said that “the ‘Y’ is the one group on campus which is
relating to the community in positive terms.”

STEP director Robert Pyeatt said of his YMCA role: “I am interested in being active in general, and the YMCA
is just a vehicle.” After an unsuccessful run for Union Board Chairman, Tom Bersuder took charge of publicity work for
the YMCA at the invitation of President Emerson Bell. According to Bersuder, the YMCA is a flexible organization in which
members of the Cabinet are not restricted to activities in their own fields of responsibility and are free to aid
and advise other Cabinet members.

Too much flexibility and autonomy can lead to inefficiency. Will Terry, who was chaplain before Scott Woodmansee, said that “if
they had organized a little more they might have gotten more done in the programs.” Pyeatt indicated that the Cabinet
sometimes acts hastily, without proper attention to detail. For example, a budget surplus of $3500 in the fiscal year 1965
was merely chalked up as a carry-over “Emergency Fund.” Following the 1966 fund drive, an Emergency Fund committee was appointed
to investigate effective uses for the money. It never made a report. Last year, another Emergency Fund committee was appointed.
It never met. The third Emergency Fund committee met last fall. In a 10-minute meeting, the committee voted to recommend
the suggestion submitted by Pyeatt that $250 be given to the Davidson Development Corporation in the form of a long-term
loan. The recommendation was passed by the committee and later by the Cabinet without explanation of the financial ramifications usually
considered important when dealing with money, Pyeatt said.

Most of the work done by the YMCA takes place under the direction of the various program chairmen. The monthly
Cabinet meeting is the time these people meet formally to exchange views and request funds. The Cabinet is primarily an
administrative body, but it can take stands when the YMCA wishes to take an official position on an issue. Bell
commented that the YMCA approach was oriented toward people rather than issues, and that this was the reason that many
students are unaware of the large number of YMCA programs on campus and in the community. “You get involved with
issues indirectly, but your first encounter is with individuals,” Scott said. He cited the YMCA’s support for the barbershop boycott
as an example.

Paul Schneider, who ran for YMCA president last year, also feels that the YMCA should go beyond being just a
service organization. “I felt that the ‘Y’ could be more active in community relations,” he said. Schneider commented favorably on
the progress that the YMCA has made in this direction in the past year, citing the growth of STEP, the
planned community center, and the pamphlet put out last fall by the YMCA explaining its programs to students as steps
toward greater community activity. The appointing of the Commission on Extra-Campus Responsibilities is another promising step. “A lot of those
things I had as complaints I don’t have any more,” he said.

The independence of the YMCA is sacrificed to some extent by the inclusion of the entire student body in its
membership, Schneider commented. He said that the YMCA has remained primarily a service organization because of the broad base of
membership, while a small dedicated group can take more definite action.

Program Places Students In Church Youth Work

The deputations program is one of the Y’s main programs in the area of worship. Students who volunteer and who
are accepted for the program are farmed out to various churches in the area, where they serve as supply ministers,
youth group leaders, or church school teachers. Most students involved in the program work with high school students, though some
also work with elementary school youngsters. According to Ran Coble, representative for deputations in the new YMCA cabinet, “There are
probably about 25 individuals involved in the present program, most of whom serve not as lay supply ministers, but as
youth leaders.” According to Coble, the deputations program provides a unique opportunity, not only for meaningful direct contacts with individuals,
but also for putting one’s faith to work in the real world. Many of the churches involved are, as Coble
noted, somewhat small and rural, although the deputations program is in effect in Statesville, Concord, and Charlotte. “However, there always
seem to be individuals who are acutely aware, even in the rural church groups, individuals who can make us reorient
our thinking.” Coble stressed that the deputations program is beneficial not only for the Davidson student, but also of great
meaning to the churches involved. “Young people today are looking for someone with whom they can communicate. A concerned college
student can often skirt age barriers which exist between youths and their parents or advisers,” Coble said.
