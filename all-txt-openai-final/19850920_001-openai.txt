**Union, Housing Office Burglarized**

By ANDREA GROSS

Police Security Chief Jackie Hughes reported that a burglar(s) entered the Union Office early Sept. 18th in the latest of a series of campus larcenies.

In other thefts, the Housing Office was robbed on Sept. 9th, money was stolen from Grey House during the football game of Sept. 7th, and soccer and football players arriving on campus before classes began had things taken from their dorm rooms.

According to the police report of the Union theft, Glenda Erwin, employee of the Dining Service, arrived at the cafe Wednesday morning to find that the lock had been cut off of a strong box in the Union Office and that the three metal money boxes it contained were missing. The thief evidently had a key to the Union office, as the door lock was not forced and the employees found the office locked when they arrived.

Taken was one 7”x 8” box containing money from the 900 Room, two 4”x 5” boxes holding money to pay the work shifts, and a set of freezer keys which were also kept in the strong box. The precise amount of money stolen was not disclosed. Hughes said all Union money is now being kept in a safe.

He added that he has no leads in the case.

An arrest has already been made in the housing office theft. Wendell McCain has been arrested and charged with taking an undisclosed sum of money from an envelope in a Housing Office drawer.

Russell Bitter reported to the police that McCain arrived in the Housing Office in order to be paid for moving refrigerators for the college. Bitter went into another room to get cash to pay McCain, leaving him in the room where the money was kept for about two minutes. When Bitter returned, the money was missing. Hughes said that since the arrest, a portion of the money has been recovered.

Other thefts reported include sums of money stolen from Grey House. Seniors Charles Jenkins and David Stout filed police reports indicating that the money, which they had left in Grey House, disappeared while the two attended a football game. The house was unlocked.

Hughes also said that some soccer and football players’ dorm rooms were robbed before classes began. He said he feels that the recent thefts are the work of outsiders, not Davidson students, mentioning that he arrested three trespassers last week.

**Director To Be Named Today**

By DAVID WILLIAMS

Vice President for Development John Griffith is expected to name a new Director of the Office of College Relations and Publications today. According to Professor Randy Nelson, the Search Committee for the Director has been interviewing candidates for the past three weeks and was scheduled to make a final recommendation to Griffith by yesterday.

The seat of the Director of Communications has remained vacant ever since former Director John Slater resigned approximately one year ago. Bill Giduz and Beverly Harris acted as Co-Directors of the office during the 1984-1985 year.

In May 1985, the Ad Hoc Committee To Evaluate the Davidson College Communications Office, chaired by Joe Gardner and Jerry Stockdale, was established to determine the future course of the office. The committee determined that the name of the office would be changed to College Relations and Publications. In its report, the Committee stated: “In the past the (Communications) Office has functioned in a passive service role, reacting to demands upon it and producing publications as requested or as necessary, and some staff members have felt that they were perceived as and expected to be merely ‘functionaries.’ We envision instead an office that is creative, pro-active and well-managed.”

In July a Search Committee, chaired by Nelson, was established and an announcement was placed in the Chronicle of Higher Education. According to Nelson, nearly three hundred people from around the country applied for the job. After working steadily for the past three weeks, the Committee narrowed the list of applicants to four candidates. During the past week, the candidates have visited Davidson and have been interviewed by various College officials as well as the Search Committee. All four candidates have chosen to keep their names confidential.

The Director’s responsibilities will include providing creative leadership for the College in its communications efforts, managing the office of College Relations and Publications, serving as senior editor for all College publications, and directing College media relations.

Nelson is confident that the office under new leadership will take larger steps to effect a solid image of Davidson College. “The Ad Hoc Committee Report lays out an ambitious program. My hope is that we live up to the report with the understanding that the college has limited resources. As one applicant put it, ‘The real Chief Communications Officer of the College is President Kuykendall,’ and this fact could limit the new Director to some extent. But we would like to see the role of the office expand.”
