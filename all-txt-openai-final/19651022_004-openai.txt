**Self-Study Sent To Association**

By MASON STEPHENSON
Davidsonian Staff Writer

Yesterday Davidson College presented its Self-Study Report to a seven-man evaluation committee of the Southern Association of Colleges and Universities
(SACU).

This report is the result of 18 months of work by faculty committees under the direction of a steering committee.
According to Dr. Frontis Johnston, dean of the faculty, every faculty member who was at Davidson two years ago is
serving on a committee.

The report itself consists of nine chapters. The first gives the history and purpose of the college, and the others
examine different aspects of the college: Organization and Administration, Educational Program, Financial Resources, Faculty, Library, Student Personnel, Physical Plant, and
Research.

This report, which was compiled under the direction of Dr. C. J. Pietenpol, professor emeritus of physics, was presented to
the SACU as part of the requirement for accreditation. The report is required by each member school every 10 years.

President Martin stated at the initiation of the evaluation in 1963: "We may as well put a real effort into
it and seek to improve Davidson with specific proposals."

The faculty and administration have put many long hours into the preparing of the reports. For instance, the Educational Program
Committee has conferred with visiting authorities, evaluated Davidson's program, and compared their findings with similar self-studies of such schools as
Amherst, Williams, Reed, and Carleton.

The Student Affairs Committee has investigated such aspects of student life as fraternities, dormitory life, social life, athletics, academics, and
cultural activities.

Concerning the usefulness of the report to the college, Johnston said, "The recommendations in the chapters will be before us
for study."

The evaluation committee of the SACU, to whom the report was presented yesterday, will visit the campus on November 14-17.
They will examine the college, make interviews, including interviews with students, and then finally present a report to the association
which will decide on accreditation.

The members of the seven-man evaluating committee are: President Howard Phillips, Birmingham-Southern College, chairman; Richard T. Barbour, Dean of the
College of Arts and Sciences, University of Louisville; Dr. Robert Lagemann, Professor of Physics and Chairman of the Planning Study
of Vanderbilt University. Also, Dr. Jack Dalton, Dean of the School of Library Science, Columbia University; Mr. A. T. Atwood,
Dean of Students, Washington and Lee University; Mr. E. L. Vaughn, Treasurer, University of the South; and Dr. Arthur E.
Jensen, Professor of English and Dean of the Faculty, Dartmouth College.
