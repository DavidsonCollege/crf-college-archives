**Wildcats open season with 2-1 split versus Georgetown**

Behind solid pitching and timely hitting, the baseball team took two of three from the visiting Georgetown Hoyas last weekend.
Under a perfect Carolina blue sky, the Wildcats split Saturday’s double-header, winning the first game 5-4, and dropping the second,
4-3, in extra innings.

Jay Heafner ’06 played the hero in game one, retiring the final two Hoya batters in the top of the
seventh and then wrapping a two-run single in the bottom half (game one was only seven innings) as he picked
up the first win of his collegiate pitching career. Davidson grabbed the early lead when Sam Navarro ’05 drove in
Eli Benefield ’05 in the first, then added two more in the third before the Hoyas could get on the
board. Georgetown took a 4-3 advantage in the seventh, scoring an unearned run, but Davidson quickly answered as Navarro and
Michael Muniz ’05 both singled and Alex Entrekin ’06 walked, loading the bases for Heafner, who slapped a single into
left field, scoring both Navarro and Muniz to win the ballgame.

Navarro led all hitters, going 3-for-4 with two runs and an RBI, while Andy Carter ’06 looked confident on the
mound, allowing one earned run in 6.1 innings work as he scattered four hits and struck out four.

Georgetown jumped out to a quick lead in game two, scoring two runs in the third, but Taylor Shoop ’06
ripped an RBI double to left center and Navarro scored on an error as the Wildcats pulled even. In the
fifth, Alden Crissy ’07 reached on an infield single, stole second, advanced to third on an error, and then scored
when Brett Peiffer ’04 grounded out to second as Davidson took a lead that was quickly erased in the sixth
when Hoya Danny Gronski homered to left. Georgetown scored what proved to be the game winner in the tenth when
Davidson pitchers walked the bases loaded and then hit a Hoya batter to walk in a run. Davidson struggled offensively
in this one, going 5-for-33 at the plate, but was able to keep it close due to five walks, four
stolen bases, and two Hoya errors.

On Sunday, Brian Akin ’04 spun an absolute gem on the hill, striking out a career-best 11 batters, and Heafner
came on to seal the deal, retiring the Hoyas in order in the ninth, as Davidson won 4-0 in the
rubber match. For his efforts, Akin was awarded SoCon Pitcher of the Week honors. Michael Muniz crossed the plate with
the game-winning run in the second after dropping a Texas-league double in right, stealing third, and scampering home when Steve
Mannenbach ’07 grounded out to first. Davidson added three insurance runs in the eighth, and Heafner induced a fly-out to
center, followed by a brilliant catch in left by Andrew Muse ’05 and a strikeout as the ’Cats closed out
a well-deserved victory.

Davidson returned to action today, playing Duke at 3 p.m., and will play Niagara on Friday at 3 p.m. before
taking on Bucknell three times this weekend. All games are at home.

From Preview, page 1

After an impressive start:

5. Georgia Southern: Don’t be surprised if this team gets upset early. The Eagles enter as the South’s No. 1
seed, but they perennially underachieve in the tournament.

THE LONG SHOTS

6. Furman: A late-season surge makes the young Paladins a dangerous draw.

7. UNC Greensboro: The SoCon’s most enigmatic team. How do you beat Georgia Southern on the road just days after
losing by 22 at home to Appalachian? Coach Fran McCaffery’s job could be in jeopardy barring a surprise run.

8. Elon: In its first season in the SoCon, the Phoenix struggled on the road but played well at home.
Hard to predict.

9. Western Carolina: SoCon leading scorer Kevin Martin (26 ppg) can’t do it by himself.

10. Wofford: A tough team at home, but the tournament isn’t played in Spartanburg.

THE DAY TRIPPERS

11. Appalachian State: If Appalachian took pride in its program, Houston Fancher would be out of a job after this
year.

12. The Citadel: Spring can’t get here soon enough for the winless Bulldogs, easily one of the worst teams in
Div. I basketball.

Brendan Winters: You can bet that opposing coaches will design their defenses around containing Winters. How he handles that pressure
will play a big role in the Wildcats’ success.

F/C Logan Kosmalski: As good as any big man in the SoCon when he stays out of foul trouble. He
should draw some double teams, creating more open looks for Davidson’s outside shooters.

G Matt McKillop: Quiet during the seven-game win streak, but McKillop could have a big tournament if defenders leave him
open beyond the arc.

F Conor Grace: Rebounding has become a major strength thanks largely to Grace’s work in the paint. His three-point shot
has improved lately as well.

F Nick Booker: A solid defender and vastly underrated passer. And he’s good for at least one highlight-reel dunk every
game.

F Ian Johnson: He gets his 10 points and could do even more if opponents slack off on him.

G Kenny Grant: It took a while, but Grant is rounding into form as a point guard. His job is
to avoid turnovers against pressure defenses and keep the offense in rhythm.

Without any timeouts, point guard Kenny Grant ’06 took the ball coast-to-coast through the Mountaineer defense, only to have his
game-winner rim out. Kosmalski, who scored 14 points and pulled down 15 boards on the night, was there for the
follow, though, and tipped in the decisive basket as the buzzer sounded to give the Wildcats an all-important 64-63 victory
on the road.

With the victory, the Wildcats moved to 15-11 on the season, including 10-5 in conference play, with their final regular
season game against the Furman Paladins on Saturday. More importantly, though, the win moved the Wildcats to within a half-game
of College of Charleston in SoCon’s South Division. Charleston goes on the road to face Furman on Wednesday, and then
finishes their Southern Conference slate at home against Top 10 ESPN.com Mid-Major and SoCon frontrunner East Tennessee State on Saturday.

If Davidson can overtake the Cougars in the final week of conference play, the Wildcats would ensure themselves a crucial
first-round bye in the Southern Conference tournament and a better chance at a potential NCAA tournament berth.
