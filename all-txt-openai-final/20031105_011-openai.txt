## Rugby upsets Div. I Wolfpack

### Women’s soccer fails to qualify for SoCon tourney

Still tired from a three-and-a-half hour drive to the North Carolina State Tournament in Fayetteville on Saturday, the rugby team
was fortunate to draw UNC Charlotte as an opening-round opponent. Having seen much success in past matches against the 49ers,
Saturday was no different, as Davidson continued its win streak with a 27-9 victory, setting up a second-round match against
NC State.

Davidson had not competed in the tournament for ten years, so a victory against the three-time defending state champs, who
compete in Division I with an enrollment ten times the size of Davidson, seemed unlikely to many members of the
NCRU (North Carolina Rugby Union). Needing no more motivation than the feeling of victory, the Wildcats had little to lose.

As the match progressed, Davidson found itself in a common situation: undersized at forward but with backs who could not
be outrun. Clearly a rough yet even match from the beginning, NC State and Davidson both took points where they
could find them, with the Wolfpack kicking one field goal and Davidson notching two before halftime.

As it turned out, the 6-3 score at the half would also be the final. As is indicative of games
in which neither team scores a try, a series of successive goal line stands by both teams constituted much of
the second half, including a final push in which time expired with State in possession of the ball a mere
five yards from the try-zone.

After the game, Bob Davis, the head of the NCRU, mentioned how the team was the clear underdog going into
the tournament and had more than made a name for itself. Unfortunately, due to various circumstances, Davidson could not return
on Sunday for the semifinals, to the disappointment of the tournament organizers.

“This victory solidifies our place as one of the top schools in North Carolina,” said co-captain Ryan Scott ’04. “We
know we can play with any team in the South, and we’re only going to get better.”

The team’s tournament success came one week after they handily defeated another prominent team, Elon, over Family Weekend. Davidson returns
home, where the ’Cats are 5-0 on the season, this weekend against Winthrop at 2 p.m. on the IMAC fields.

## Volleyball subdues Citadel, falls short at home against CofC

For a team desperately searching for momentum in a difficult season, this past weekend represented a rare opportunity for the
Wildcat volleyball squad: back-to-back games at home and a chance to dethrone Southern Conference front-runner College of Charleston.

The Wildcats opened the weekend on Friday against The Citadel, a team Davidson beat 3-1 earlier this season in Charleston.
With a boisterous Halloween crowd, the ’Cats jumped on The Citadel in the first game with a late 7-0 run.
According to Rachel Gleed ’06, who led the ’Cats with 16 kills in the match, “Going into Friday’s game against
The Citadel, we knew that it was not a match we could overlook... It all comes down to who wants
it more. In the first game we came together and did things with purpose. We left little room for errors
and that is what made it easy.”

After the first-game rally, the ’Cats would go on to cruise in a 3-0 shutout.

In the second match of the weekend double-header, Davidson looked to unseat College of Charleston, who shut out the ’Cats
3-0 earlier this season. The momentum from The Citadel game appeared to flow into the Saturday contest as well, as
the Wildcats jumped out quickly to a 19-8 lead in the first game. “It was awesome to see the energy
from the previous night carry over into the Charleston game,” said Gleed after the match. “We got a big lead
in the beginning, and I think we even surprised ourselves.”

Unfortunately for the Wildcats, that spurt was not enough to finish off the Cougars, as they slowly inched back into
the frame before taking the game at 31-29. Davidson struggled in a lopsided 30-15 loss in the second game and
appeared to have given up when the Cougars jumped to a 19-9 lead in the third frame.

This time, however, the ’Cats fought back to bring the score to within one point at 28-29 before falling 30-28.
Still, as Gleed noted, “‘Nothing to lose’ was our cheer for that night, and we did a better job in
[the third game] of representing that statement. We made some adjustments on the court that helped us out, but we
also brought back some of the energy from the first game.win that we would have liked to have, but hopefully
we realize the level we are capable of playing at.”

Swimming out-strokes Gardner-Webb

In their first home meet of the year, the women’s swim team defeated Gardner-Webb by a score of 158-104 over
Family Weekend. The Wildcats improved their record to 1-1 this season with the victory, coming off a loss in their
first meet against Emory. Sara Laws ’04, who swam for first place in both the 100 and 200 backstroke, felt
that with a week of practice between the loss in the season opener, “The confidence level was a huge improvement
going into the meet, and, because of that, the team was able to change the little things that always make
a big difference in the outcome of a meet.”

Just one week after Eli Trefzger ’07 set the school record for the 1000 freestyle with a time of 10:34.81,
Casey Grimes ’06 broke the week-old record, finishing with a time of 10:34.58. Trefzger continued in her strong performance with
first place finishes in the 200 and 500 freestyle. Right behind her in the 200 were teammates Erin Rosintoski ’04
in second place and Kristen Shields ’06 in third. Vanessa Witt ’04 and Brigit Barry ’07 took first and second
place in the 100 fly with times of 1:00.26 and 1:01.60, respectively.

The Wildcat relay teams swept both heats, with the 200 medley team of Barry, Witt, Megan Hollar ’06, and Jamie
Sasanfar ’05 finishing first with a time of 1:50.27. The 200 freestyle relay team of Sasanfar, Hollar, Rosintoski, and Jenny
Hoesktra ’05 took first with a time of 1:41.51. Hollar also finished first in both the 100 and 200 breast.
Hollar said after the meet, “We were excited to have a win, and the coaches were really pleased with all
of our performances. Overall as a team, I think we swam better this meet than we did at Emory. Hopefully,
we can keep that going for ECU. They are a big team and really competitive. I think if we race
hard like we did this weekend, we should be able to give them a good meet.”

The men and women’s teams host East Carolina University on November 8 at 1 p.m.

“If we win, we’re in.” That was the mantra as the women’s soccer team entered their final home game on
Sunday against UNCG. The game would decide whether or not the team would make the field for the Southern Conference
tournament. The Wildcats (6-12-2) were the underdogs coming into the game against the Spartans (11-6-2). Davidson controlled much of the
play in the first half, taking the lead in the 30th minute on sophomore Kara Koehrn’s seventh goal of the
season. UNCG’s reply came less than seven minutes later on a header past the keeper, making the halftime score 1-1.
The Spartans turned up the heat on offense and silenced Davidson’s upset bid on a goal 10 minutes into the
second half. The ’Cats continued to fight but watched their SoCon hopes disappear as the Spartans netted their third goal
in the 71st minute.

The final goal marked a sad ending for the six Davidson seniors on Senior Day. The sour taste was made
worse for many of the seniors who watched much of the game from the sidelines. In fact, only a few
saw significant playing time and others were not played until the contest had already been decided. It has been a
frustrating year for the upperclassmen, who were unable to adjust to a continuously-changing lineup, which at one point featured as
many as five starting freshmen. Without a reliable game-to-game lineup, the team was unable to find its niche. Inconsistency led
to an up and down season littered with winnable games the ’Cats had trouble closing out.

Despite the rough ending, head coach Kevin Handley seemed proud of his players, saying, “I appreciate the leadership of this
year’s senior class. We will always remain a team in spite of the fact that we have no more games
to play.” Seniors Alia Antonucci-Alter, Deneille Erikson, Leigh Anne Hoskins, Sarah Huber, Amy Leitch, and Catie Williams will graduate in
May.
