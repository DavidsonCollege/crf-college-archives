The Great Wall of China is the Shangri-La of Charlotte. The service is formal but friendly, the price for a full (and filling) meal generally around $5 and the selection is incredible.

The menu is divided into mild-Mandarin, spicy Szechuan and Hunan, and traditional Cantonese. Rice, Chinese vegetables and tea are included with each entree. Especially delicious: Moo Goo Gai Pan, Chicken with Cashew Nuts, and Sweet and Sour Pork. The Combination dinners are appealing, but it’s fun (and more food) when everyone orders their favorites and passes the plates. Don’t pass up the Pu-Pu platter; it is a flaming assortment of entrees that includes barbecued ribs, egg rolls, roast beef, and shrimp toast.

The Great Wall of China is on Montford Road off Southpark Road in Charlotte. Shangri-La is no secret—so call in advance for supper reservations.
