New Faces To Key Wildcat Grid Hopes

New faces will be the order of the day for the second year under head coach Dave Fagg: new players,
new offenses, and a new assistant. Last year the Wildcats presented first-year head coach Fagg with the task of rebuilding
an offensive unit which had spearheaded Davidson’s drive for their first Southern Conference title in the school's history. Mark Thompson,
Mike Mikolayunas, and Rick Lyon filled the gaps left on the national statistics list by the graduation of Gordon Slade,
Mike Kelly, and George Hannon, but the ‘Cats struggled to a 2-8 final mark, losing four contests in the fourth
quarter.

McGeachy Departs Staff For Duke Freshman Post

For the second time in two years, Davidson is searching mid-summer for a basketball coach. Assistant coach Neill McGeachy announced
July 1 that he has accepted the position of freshman coach at Duke University. In addition, McGeachy will serve as
an assistant for Bucky Waters, the Blue Devils' varsity coach. Davidson head coach Terry Holland indicated that McGeachy will be
replaced by two new assistants, one man to coach the freshmen and a second to head up the school's recruiting
program. McGeachy had filled both roles.

“Neill did a very good job for us at Davidson,” said Holland. “We are not opening the job. It's set
as far as we're concerned. There are major changes taking place in the program, but we're not ready to say
what they are. We are going to hire a freshman coach as well as a coach to do the recruiting.
It’s more a redefining of responsibilities as far as we're concerned,” continued Holland. He did indicate that the Wildcats' staff
should be set in the near future. Bo Brickles remains as an assistant coach and chief scout. In the last
two years, Brickles and McGeachy had divided the recruiting activity by regions, McGeachy operating in the east and northeast while
Brickles covered the midwest.

McGeachy starred in both football and basketball during his college career at Lenoir Rhyne, winning all-Carolinas Conference honors in basketball
and Little All-America as a football receiver. He had professional tryouts with both the Atlanta Falcons and the Carolina Cougars.

MINI SUMMER JOCKS Camps Program

If you heard the patter of little feet at Davidson this summer, chances are that those feet were shod in
tennis shoes. For the second year, Davidson College sponsored a...

Fogleman To Lecture At Forest Hills Clinic

Davidson tennis coach Harry Fogleman will be one of the guest lecturers at the National Tennis Teachers Conference to be
held at Forest Hills, New York, September 2-5. Fogleman will speak on the four days of the conference, lecturing on
diverse topics including strategy, college-level coaching, and practice methods. The clinic, which is to be an annual event, is timed
to coincide with the United States Open championship at Forest Hills. The conference is open to all tennis teachers, coaches,
and professionals.

Fogleman is no stranger to tennis clinics. He was one of the organizers and instructors in the first clinic ever
held in the United States. His second annual Wildcat Tennis Camp wrapped up operations after four one-week sessions. A special
session was designed to improve the play and strategy of nationally ranked players. As a college coach, Fogleman has compiled
a 384-130 record with...Teams at Florida, Duke, Cincinnati, and Davidson. His Davidson teams have won the Southern Conference title six
of the last seven seasons. A comprehensive set of summer athletic camps drew youngsters of all ages to the campus
for instruction in their favorite sport. Camps were held for tennis, football, baseball, and basketball.

In addition to Davidson's usual complement of male campers, Harry Fogleman's tennis camp also brought a number of female participants
who stayed in the residence halls. Coexistence with Davidson summer students was peaceable, with relations smoothed by the nightly movies
which were part of the camps’ program. Athletic Business Manager Frederick Outlaw was the director of the camp program and
seemed quite pleased with maximum enrollment, an improvement over last year's initial operation. In addition to the benefits for the
campers, Outlaw pointed to the benefits which accrue to Davidson College as a result of the summer program.

With graduation again taking a heavy toll, including Thompson, Mikolayunas, and Lyon, Bagg again faces a heavy rebuilding task as
fall practice commences. The Wildcats’ new face on the coaching staff, Ernie Tall, will share the task of rebuilding the
offense with Fagg. Tall, 24, has five years of coaching experience on the collegiate level. As a freshman at Western
Michigan, he sustained a knee injury which ended his playing career. Tall coached freshmen and redshirts for three years at
Western Michigan and another two years as a graduate assistant at South Carolina.

Early indications from the spring practice sessions are that the Wildcats may move more on the ground than they have
in the past. While Thompson, Slade, and Jimmy Poole have been setting passing marks for the past six seasons, the
ground game has been less than impressive. Senior Johnny Ribet and junior Bill Bracken may have signaled the end of
Davidson's complete reliance on the aerial game last fall with 625 and 610 yards respectively. The halfback tandem picked up
more yardage rushing than any Wildcat team since 1966, and both are threats to erase the school record for single-season
rushing yardage.

The Wildcats also face the problem of replacing the entire interior offensive line. Guard Jim Ellison is tabbed as all-Conference
material. Guard Robert Elliott, tackle Larry Spears, and centers Bill Nicklas and Jim Hankinson were also impressive in spring drills.

High on the list of priorities for Fagg is shoring up a defense which last year yielded an average of
30 points a contest. Bill Garrett, a junior tackle, will lead an all-new line. Linebacking and the defensive backfield are
strong points with six returnees. All three starting linebackers, Woody Montgomery, Robert Norris, and John Barbee, are all-Southern candidates, and
Joe Poteat is just a step behind. Terry Woodlief, Tom Vandiver, and John Maloney are counted on in the backfield.
