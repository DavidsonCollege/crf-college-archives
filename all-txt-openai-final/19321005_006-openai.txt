**Wofford Terriers Bring Strong Grid Eleven to Battle Wildcats Friday**

**Visitors Come to Davidson With Two Victories for 1932 Season**

Friday, Wofford brings its best team in recent years to Davidson to battle the Wildcats. Reports from that institution point
out that this year’s grid edition is indeed strong, possessing a weighty and experienced forward wall coupled with a shifty
backfield, and plenty of reserve power. Regardless of these rather glaring reports, the Wildcats reign the pre-game favorites, although the
margin of favoritism is very slight.

The last Davidson-Wofford encounter occurred in 1930, in which encounter the Cats emerged the victors by a 7-0 tally. However,
since this date Wofford football has improved materially and a very close battle is expected. The game was originally scheduled
to be played on Saturday, but was pushed back a day in view of the fact that Wake Forest is
engaging the South Carolina Gamecocks on that date. This move enables the fans of the district hereabouts to witness both
contests.

The Wildcat coaching staff stated that they expect to start the same lineup used against Washington and Lee last Saturday.
The probability is that practically the same array that began Saturday's game for Wofford against High Point College will start
against the Cats Friday, the seventh. In last Saturday's game with High Point the Terriers rolled up an amazing score
of 34-0. At no point of the game was a rather strong High Point team able to threaten against a
bristling Wofford defense.

In Lon Bouknight and Jack Monroe the Terriers present a pair of touchdown twins that will be hard to stop.
Bouknight does the Wofford passing and punting besides running the ball nicely. Monroe nicely takes care of the line plunging
phase of Wofford’s attack. Reports also indicate that Monroe blocks with terrific force and is the nucleus of the Terriers’
pass defense. These two will bear watching.

Substitution to break up the charge. The third period found the two teams making only desultory bids for touchdowns, and
the period ended with the oval in the Generals’ possession on the Davidson 48-yard line. Dewey Hutchins, Johnny Mackorell, and
George Wingfield, all sophomores, led the offensive play for the Wildcats, although they were given much assistance by Pearce and
Peabody, both veterans of several campaigns. Joe Morris at right end and Jack Wagner at left tackle were outstanding in
the Wildcat line. Wagner sustained a broken leg.

Several of the Generals showed some ability as ball carriers, but failed to produce the elusive, shifty plunges that were
needed. Captain Bolen, until he was injured, Boland, Ruffner, and Hanley were stalwarts in the forward wall. The Generals suffered
in the second quarter when Captain Bolen, who had played a strong game at right guard, broke his leg, trying
to stave off one of the Wildcat rushes.

It was three years ago when the last Jimmy DeHart-coached team performed on Richardson Field. It was the Duke Blue
Devils and they were nosed out when Thad Brock made his memorable dash clean down the length of the field
from punt formation for a startling touchdown.

—and raw tobaccos have no place in cigarettes

They are not present in Luckies ... the mildest cigarette you ever smoked

We buy the finest, the very finest tobaccos in all the world—but that does not explain why folks everywhere regard
Lucky Strike as the mildest cigarette. The fact is, we never overlook the truth that “Nature in the Raw is
Seldom Mild”—so these fine tobaccos, after proper aging and mellowing, are then given the benefit of that Lucky Strike purifying
process, described by the words—“It’s toasted”. That’s why folks in every city, town and hamlet say that Luckies are such
mild cigarettes.

“It’s toasted”

“If a man write a better book, preach a better sermon, or make a better mouse-trap than his neighbor, tho
he build his house in the woods, the world will make a beaten path to his door.”—RALPH WALDO EMERSON.

Does not this explain the world-wide acceptance and approval of Lucky Strike?
