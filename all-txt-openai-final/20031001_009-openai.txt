**October air brings baseball fever**

**Athletes become heroes again in postseason**

It got a little chilly this week. Perfect timing. As division races come to a close and the baseball playoffs
begin, the air of mystery that swirls in with that first crisp hint of autumn brings with it the first
feelings of the impending excitement on the orange and yellow horizon. Who could help but reminisce? The aura of anticipation
that surrounds the Fall Classic, like most things, seems proportionately larger the farther we travel back in time to remember
it. No matter how big we get or old we grow, the magnitude and history of the event are enough
to make anyone feel small again. It allows us to bend down and look through the wide eyes of that
awestruck little kid and see the Series for what it was then, and, in this sense, still is.

Athletes become heroes again, larger than life because of the home runs they hit and the uniforms they wear, not
the steroids they inject or the dietary supplements they ingest. The cork they use fills only the champagne bottles that
await the winning team in the locker room. Broken bats warrant attention only if they happen to head in your
direction. Spit has only two destinations: the mouth or the ground. Batters run out every fly ball because they want
to win, and pitchers throw inside to inflate the strike zone, not their egos. The players on your team are
your guys and always have been, whether they’ve been with the organization for a decade or a year. Memories of
past teams, trades, and signings disappear the moment he gets that first postseason hit or strikeout for the home team.

In high school football, acts of both heroics and hazing can turn up frequently. As for heroics, a Bishop-Hoban senior,
Gerry McGroarty, kicked a 64-yard field goal on Saturday. This record not only crushes any high school record, but it
beats the current NFL record. Jason Elam was the last player to kick a 63-yard field goal in the NFL.
And for hazing, at Luke-Lehman High, a junior varsity quarterback was tied to a chair and plastered with pain-relieving ointment
on his face. After a practice on Wednesday, four linemen on the team felt the need to harass this QB
for his interception-throwing performance in the previous game. The chair ended up slipping and Adam Harris fell to the ground
and cut his head. He commented afterwards, “They told me this is what happens when you throw interceptions.”

The Detroit Tigers did everything they needed to do to finish out their season the way they wanted. They won
five of their last six games, their best six-game stretch of the season, and avoided making history. With two more
losses, the Tigers would have held the MLB record for losses in a season. The 1964 Mets currently hold the
record with 120. The Tigers finished with 119 losses and a good taste in their mouths as they break for
the winter.

The Yankees, having already clinched their home-field advantage playoff spot, decided to have some fun on Sunday. As David Wells
collected his win, the team celebrated their upcoming postseason.

And the ugly ideas of labor disputes and strike dates disappear with them. These heroes receive their pay from the
affection of fans and the acclaim of their teammates, not to mention the thrill of postseason play. Complicated complaints of
ludicrous contracts and skyrocketing payrolls fade away into the world of adult concerns, where they belong.Talk of television deals and
sports sponsorships. Network Associates Coliseum and Pacific Bell Park are simply Oakland and San Francisco Stadium. Yankee Stadium—hey, it’s always
been Yankee Stadium, and that will never change. And through this child, you can once again walk into one of
these stadiums and feel dwarfed by the size of the field and the sound of the crowd, instead of crushed
by corporate control. Suddenly, the six-dollar hot dog in your hand becomes a simple ballpark frank again, as if your
father had silently paid for it while you were staring intently at the action on the field. Take a bite
and enjoy. This is what makes it classic.

Underage drinking and other stuff end, Armour shot a 26-under 254 to win the event by seven strokes. The victory
was the second of his career, but the first witnessed by his thirteen-year-old son. His first victory came in 1990
before his son was born.

Being the owner of a team, it is suitable that you get to make all the decisions. When Roger Clemens
collected his 200th career win, it wasn’t manager Joe Torre who walked to the mound to take him out. It
was Roger Clemens, who was playing manager for the day. Andy Pettitte played bench manager, but no one got Steinbrenner’s
job for the day. Too much money to be pleaded.

Zach Randolph pleaded guilty to underage drinking and was fined a hefty sum. And we wonder why pro athletes think
they can get away with anything. When you are also a player, you get to choose when you play. Mario
Lemieux, owner/player of the Pittsburgh Penguins, has decided to play in his first pre-season game in two years. His reason
for playing: he wants to play with the new players on the team. His reason for choosing Friday’s home game
vs. the Columbus Blue Jackets: he doesn’t want to spend...

Blazers forward Zach Randolph pleaded guilty in his trial for underage drinking. In May, the twenty-year-old was arrested and charged
with a misdemeanor count of possession of alcohol by a minor. He was fined a hefty sum of $1 and
given sixty days of informal probation. And we wonder why pro athletes think they can get away with anything.

Tommy Armour III put his name in the PGA record books when he shot the lowest 72-hole round ever in
a PGA tour event. At the Texas Open this past week...

DAVIS’ PICKS OF THE WEEK

Wildcat game of the week:
Football vs. Dayton
1 p.m. on Saturday
Reason: It is homecoming weekend, and nothing goes with homecoming more than football. The two teams are playing each other
for the first time, and the “Cats are looking to extend their winning streak to three games.

Jockey Donnie Meche was told by a state judge that his one-year suspension is being upheld. He had requested that
this suspension be canceled, but the request was dismissed by Judge Rosemary Cedet. Back in January, he was suspended for
“not doing his best” at the Delta Downs with his horse, Cleaning House. During the race, the horse stumbled twice,
acquired a hoof injury that was discovered after the race, and finished in third place—just enough effort to warrant suspension.

Outside the Den:
Friday at 8 p.m.
Reason: It’s October and time for playoff baseball. For what will be the second game of the series, the Braves,
winners of the NL East, have Greg Maddux on the hill. The Cubs, winners of the NL Central, are giving
the nod to Mark Prior.
