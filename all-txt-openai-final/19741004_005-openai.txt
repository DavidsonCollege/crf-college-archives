Davidson never ceases to amaze me. Isn’t it? Read the catalog, the materials, talk to alumni and administrators, and you’ll
find Davidson has a lot to offer. For instance, Davidson is dedicated to the development of the ‘whole man’ (and
woman). We get four years of liberal education in a tolerant Christian atmosphere, a chance to explore different modes of
thinking and being, to learn about how to cope and how to live, to learn about ourselves and others. And,
as if all of these somewhat ethereal goals are not sufficient in themselves, Davidson also offers a most enticing fringe
benefit: social and economic success. Yes, it’s true; Davidson has an awful lot of prestige and a high success rate
in merging graduate and professional schools, and a rosy, successful career. The statistics which prove Davidson’s success in this latter
area of fellowship and grad schools are always close at hand. And since about 90 percent of the entering freshmen
want to go to grad school, and since about 75 percent of the seniors actually go, you see why these
statistics are so important and appealing. That is why I say Davidson is unbelievable—because it claims to be able to
combine these two disparate sets of values into one educational experience. I’m afraid that that is too good to be
true. There is nothing wrong with the incompatibility of two such orientations. They mix about as well as SPE’s and
Patterson Court. Understand, first, that I’m taking the worst view of the matter for the sake of polemic. I simply
want to make the point that at Davidson, like anywhere else, there is a limit to the amount of cake
that one can simultaneously have and eat.

The latter concept of education, what you could call end-product oriented education, is tangible, and brings us distinction, money, and
applicants who are requisite. That is why we pay people to put out brochures on our SAT averages and the
number of Rhodes Scholars we have engendered. That is also the main reason most of us are paying to be
here. If things were just that simple, we could all be relatively content. But of course, our pretensions are somewhat
loftier. The ideal of our small liberal arts college is that as much concern and value is placed on the
process as on the final reward, that our education will run deeper than problems of grad school admissions (conceded that
that is a bigger problem all the time). The college is here to “liberalize” us, to free us. Unfortunately for
our reputation, I suppose, if you “liberalize” a person, provide him with a chance to experiment with various lifestyles and
outlooks, then you cannot be sure that he or she will be a typical Davidson man (or woman) who needs
no introduction, or that he will be a credit to our name in the real world of academic and professional
hierarchies. I mean, isn’t it obvious that a graduate accepted at Harvard is worth more to Davidson than one who,
as a result of his increased self-awareness, has decided to try his hand at farming? It’s not that the will
to liberate isn’t present at Davidson—it permeates our language—it’s just that this final-product model of education tends to drive out
the more liberal concept, just as bad money tends to drive out good. I don’t condemn the college for its
inability to perform miracles. I even believe that a certain degree of integration of the two philosophies can take place,
and that it is possible that Davidson does a better job of it than most colleges. There have been attempts,
almost always controversial, to broaden the horizon, such as the JYA programs, the Center for Honors Study, the South Asian
Studies program; I appreciate the forces who push for such changes, who believe that Davidson should be preparation for life
as well as for graduate school. So I’m not complaining, nor am I bitter. My point is this: to the
degree that Davidson places ultimate value on the final, predictable product, we are stuck with an education which consists of
punching the clock, of serving your time (four years of hard labor), and of receiving in the end your reward
of Davidson prestige and a good law school, or whatever. I think Davidson is in a position to do more.

Canine Growlings Replace Eloquence

Nitpicking is in merited fashion these days. Slashes of pens aim to level sub-standard thinking and to retrieve our sheep’s
clothing from the greedy clutches of the laundry Cyclops. The Spirit of Nader reigns. I wish to claim a small
corner of the bandwagon, but (warning!) my twine may be twisted to different ends. I tread gently, for my subject
is shunned by those who seek allies. I speak of those friends of all, those midnight guardians of deserted lounges:
the campus dog corps. Horrors! Is this man a heartless emissary of Public Health sterility with eviction notices in hand?
Where’s your collar, Rover, the holiday is over. Not on your life. I claim a lengthy communion with our listless
strays, and offer the serene comfort of the doormat on my back porch.At any time. After all, who else could
provide such impromptu diversions at football games than Stink nonchalantly chalking the lines? I merely wish to relate two incidents
mingled with a few fine distinctions.

**Distinction the First:** The subject of my peculiar brand of muckraking is dogs; the object is yet to appear (this
will require further distinction; patience).

**Incident the First:** In the woods one late summer afternoon, a member of the canine corps imposed himself upon us.
After much debate, this obviously sick and lonesome creature was named Buzz, an event far less interesting to him than
the bowl of chicken scraps under his nose. Buzz demanded a peculiar form of communication. His articulate heights were reached
with post-midnight whines and whimpers outside my window. One could not reason with Buzz. “Your future happiness, Sir, depends on
the cessation of your struggles as I attempt to remove these ticks.” No progress. Buzz responded only to mutterings of
endearment. “Dat’s a good dog, yes it is, good food, mmmmmmm, yeah!” A satisfactory answer from Buzz was a yawn.
Buzz departed after three days of rest and recuperation.

**Incident the Second:** On a late night pilgrimage to the mists of the soccer field, an unidentified wanderer was joined
by yet another campus stray. Impressed by the hysteric mode of communication drifting over the trees from an outdoor party
band, the wanderer attempted to revive the art of quiet conversation with the dog. “Good evening. I see you also
prefer to try your luck away from the crowd. Do join me.” Silence. “Do you see that airplane up there?
Ah, you hear it though. Did you know that we allow ourselves a classification as higher beings than you because
we can build and fly things like those lights flashing up there? When they crash, we can even figure out
what went wrong.” Silence. “I guess that doesn’t bother you. You’re happy just plodding around out here. I bet you
can smell things out here I’ll never smell, though. At least you don’t scream into microphones.” Silence. But I think
he understood, because he licked my hand before he left.

**Distinction the Second:** The point of all this rambling is that we talk to each other like we talk to
our dogs. (The object of my feeble muckraking emerges.) Mumblings and mutterings are our substitutes for studied eloquence. Grunting lies
around the corner (or can be found on a Sunday morning clustered around the coffee and Alka-Seltzer). Mumbling is fine,
but it demands help in conveying any intelligible content. One couldn’t reach Buzz with his favorite baby talk without patting
his head or scratching behind his ears. If our words are to travel on their own power, then they deserve
cultivation. Articulation has its rewards, be it as small as a licked hand. We, too, can communicate with gestures and
touch, but they can be saved to heighten more intimate moments when words fail. While words can serve, the power
of their gift should be used. Next time you meet a campus dog, try something other than a whistle and
a scratch and see if you don’t catch a knowing twinkle in his eye.

**Coup Overthrows Free Radio**

Heavily armed soldiers of the elite Wrotcee Brigade stood in front of the building from which Radio Free Void broadcast
its sometimes-clandestine programs. I stopped a passerby and asked him the reason for this curious activity. “Haven’t you heard?” he
said. “The government has taken control of the radio station. They say it’s because they want to improve the quality
of the programming, but everybody knows the real reason is that they’re afraid of some kind of coup or something.
After all, the station is pretty radical, and who knows what perverted acts they could provoke certain malcontents into performing?
That’s why they put the guards there—in case any of those weirdos from the station try anything funny.”

In that vicinity, the chairman of the kingdom addressed the television viewers. “My fellow citizens, I am speaking to you
tonight to clear up any misunderstandings about the government’s actions in placing Radio Free Void under government control. This was
done strictly to upgrade the quality of the programming. With this in mind, we are planning to re-emphasize the station
so that the broadcasts will reach even to Realworld. That way, Realworld, which has not paid us much attention recently,
will once again become aware of the Kingdom as we pipe classical music and education, including such award-winning documentaries as
‘The Swedish Woman,’ into their very living rooms; the money should then begin to flow once again into our coffers.

“We may have to import some technical experts from Realworld to run the station, but there will be plenty for
the old staff members to do. Somebody has to type the reports and fetch the coffee. Why, perhaps we can
even give them their own new little station, run just like the present one used to be. Remember how fun
it was in the good old days when you had to plug your radio into the sink and run the
signal through an amplifier to pick up the station? And that, citizens, is the true story of the change in
policy. Thank you, and goodnight.”
