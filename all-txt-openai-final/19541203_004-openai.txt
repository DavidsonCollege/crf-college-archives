**SERGEANT SKETCH**

SFC W. D. FRICKS

Sergeant First Class W. D. Frick, Assistant Operations Sergeant of the Davidson College R.O.T.C. Department, entered the Army in 1940
at Greenville, S.C. His first two years of army life were spent at Fort Bragg, but in October 1942, Sgt.
Frick departed for French Morocco, arriving there on November 8. After moving through Africa and into Sicily with the Seventh
Army, Sgt. Frick was transferred to England with the 60th Infantry of the Ninth Division. He left England on June
10, 1944, and was discharged from the army in June 1945.

Sgt. Frick entered Clemson College under the G.I. Bill, but after one and a half years, he reenlisted in the
army and was sent to Trieste in July 1948, as a member of the 351st Infantry. In September 1952, Sgt.
Frick returned to the United States and was stationed at Camp Rucker, Alabama until April 1953, at which time he
reported to Davidson College.

Sergeant First Class Frick’s awards include the American Defense Ribbon, E.T.O., with seven Battle Stars, Good Conduct Ribbon with Three
Clusters, Bronze Star, and Occupation Ribbon.

If Floyd plays all season like he played the latter part of last year, when he averaged twenty-five points a
game, the Furman team will rate as a definite threat. West Virginia will count on Rod Hundley, sophomore sensation from
Charleston, W.Va. Hundley averaged thirty-four points a game for the freshman team last season, although he refused to shoot in
many games. He is picked as the outstanding sophomore prospect in the East. To go with Hundley, the Mountaineers will
have a tall team which is changing from a zone to a man-to-man defense under their new head coach.

Not much is known about the William and Mary team which finished fifth last season. The team lost Wednesday to
the powerful North Carolina State five, 111-97. The lower part of the standings, composed of V.M.I., Davidson, Washington and Lee,
Virginia Tech, and The Citadel, is expected to remain in the lower half of the league with the only difference
being the rise in standings of possibly the Washington and Lee team. The Virginia Tech team will be composed mostly
of sophomores and is probably still a year away from becoming a power in the league.

The conference is generally expected to be tougher all-around, and if the basketball bounces as crazily as the football did
this fall, we may find an entirely different picture when tournament time rolls around.

one year on such programs as Kraft Television Theatre, Philco Playhouse, and Studio One. A professional star is to play
the lead in this premiere performance of the play, which tells the story of a twenty-seven-year-old trying to find a
happy life of her own. Tickets for the play are $1.50 for students and $2.00 for other persons. Reservations may
be made by writing to the Theatre Department of Woman’s College.

**Brown and Wharton Announce Grants**

**W.F. Will Meet With Queens On Sunday**

A joint meeting with Queens has been planned by Davidson’s Westminster Fellowship for this Sunday night. The meeting will start
with a light supper at 5:30 in the basement of the church, and then there will be a discussion upstairs
in the Student Lounge. In this discussion, the group will consider the possibilities of organizing a Westminster Fellowship at Queens.
E.T. Miller, Fellowship Commission Chairman, has planned the transportation and the program for this meeting. All members are cordially urged
to attend this meeting.

...his last four games. Charlie Rankin is another former Fayetteville ace on the Cat squad. After playing his first season
under Crowell Little, Charlie sat out the next two seasons, but he returned to the squad this season and turned
in a top-flight job at his end position. Charlie did some fine pass-catching and really shone on defense. Last, but
by a long shot not least, is Jim Thacker, the 165-pound halfback from Rome, Ga., one of the all-time backfield
greats in Wildcat football. Jim performed in out...Standing out in fashion for four years, and in both his sophomore and
junior years, he averaged better than five yards per carry. Most folks in these parts feel that Jim could play
on almost any team in the country, and undoubtedly he is one of the finest backs ever to don a
Cat uniform. This season, Thacker often found opposing defenses concentrating on stopping him, but it seems they never quite succeeded.
He did a great job as Co-Captain, and despite an early-season injury, he was given an Honorable Mention on the
All-Conference team.

There are three Seniors who had a large part to do with Davidson’s fortunes this season, though they did not
wear the Red and Black. Bill Acker, Charlie Cousar, and Leroy Fargason were the coaches of the Junior Varsity and
helped a lot with the varsity club, too. Acker had run out his eligibility, while Fargason and Cousar received injuries
which kept them out of the line-up.

THE DAVIDSONIAN

BY NINE DAVIDSONIANS

N. Seminar Attended

BY WALTER DAVIS

This past weekend nine Davidson students attended the semi-annual U.N. Seminar which was sponsored by the National Student YMCA and
YWCA. With us were 100 other students from as far as Nebraska, in the United States, and Pakistan overseas. We
participated in a variety of activities at the United Nations Seminar such as touring the U.N. building, sitting in on
committee meetings and the General Assembly, and discussing with various speakers the duties, powers, and problems of the 60 nations
represented.

One attitude that we discussed at length is the opinion of so many that the U.N. is not a worthwhile
organization and is not fulfilling its purpose. The argument against the U.N. is that it talks much and acts very
little. While this is partially true, it was suggested that these factors be remembered:

1. The U.N. provides the only meeting ground for nations of the world to meet together peacefully and discuss their
problems. In previous years, these same countries have gone to war over insignificant incidents. Now probably countless lives are being
saved daily by the art of diplomacy in the U.N.

2. The U.N. is the only hope of small countries. Without public opinion or suggestions offered by the U.N., small
countries undoubtedly would be swallowed up by larger countries and the old policy of a “balance of power” between the
large countries would again manifest itself.

Those who feel unfavorably toward the U.N. should consider the tension areas that the U.N. has partially settled. War was
stopped in Korea, the lives of many men being saved. The Trieste problem and the fighting between the Israeli and
Arabs are two other areas where the U.N. has had great influence. Perhaps the biggest area in which the U.N.
is working constantly is that of economic and social aid. Few Americans, in our prosperity, realize the starvation, poverty, illiteracy,
lack of sanitation, and lack of modern methods of farming and technology that exist over a large portion of the
world. A staggering fact to all of us should be that 60 percent of the earth’s population never gets enough
to eat. The U.N., limited greatly by small donations, is aiding less developed peoples all over the world who otherwise
would not receive assistance.

The four main issues before the U.N.—disarmament, peaceful use of atomic power, economic and social aid, and nationalism—were vividly presented
to us. One point that is often overlooked received special attention. It is that the United Nations organization has no
legislative power. It can only suggest to the individual nations certain solutions. The power lies in the governments of the
member nations. They can accept or refuse the suggestions of the U.N. Of course, there is some force in mere
suggestion by the U.N. and that is the force of public opinion. Many nations have felt morally bound to comply
with the wishes of so many countries.

Another attitude that was discussed is America’s prejudice and superior attitude. We tend to believe that the United States’ preferences
are always superior to those of other countries and that the U.N. is failing unless its decisions are favorable to
U.S. policy. In doing this we fail to realize one of the main functions of the U.N., that of compromise,
the yielding of certain points by both sides involved.

The Seminar was a very enlightening experience for all of us who attended. We feel that the U.N. is the
only instrument now in use which can possibly ensure world peace, and that the duties and powers of the U.N.
will be expanded and improved as time goes on.

Robinson Tells . . .

(Continued From Page One)

The cure of cancer does not seem far off now with radioactive isotopes at the beck and call of science.
Pneumonia today is not the dread disease that it was twenty years ago. When a case arose then, the doctor
had to see his patient three or four times each day, but today with the new “wonder drugs” a patient
is up and feeling fine in a few days.

Dr. Robinson was graduated from Davidson College with an A.B. degree. His first two years of medical school were spent
at the University of North Carolina and his last two at the University of Pennsylvania, where he finished second in
his class. Dr. Robinson has been practicing medicine in Charlotte for 23 years. His son, Charlie, a junior at Davidson,
is a pre-medical student.

Sig Up Hears Christmas Story, Book Review

The regular biweekly meeting of Sigma Upsilon was held Thursday night in the Sigma Chi fraternity house with President Vereen
Bell presiding. Frank White opened the program by reading his short story, “Tell Me a Christmas Story,” which described an
old shepherd's narration to his young grandson of the life of Jesus and what it meant to the Jews. After
a critical analysis of the story by the group, Dr. A. V. Goldiere read a book review on The Personal
Diary of Stendhal, which also provoked discussion. Then the meeting was adjourned for refreshments and informal discussions. Many of the
members enjoyed talking with Mr. Carl Holty of the Arts Program of the Association of American Colleges, who visited the
meeting.
