Page Four THE DAVIDSONIAN __ Friday, February 25, 1944

WILDCATS GO TO TOURNAMENT

BOB FLOWERS—Guard

STARTERS—These are the men on whom Davidson pins its hopes for winning the Southern Conference Tournament. Along with Ashmore and
Ellington, these five have carried the Cats to three conference wins, against N. C. State, the Citadel, and Clemson.

The University of South Carolina, and two to N. C. State. Carrying on the excellent play of last year’s outstanding
five, this year’s cagers are rated as one of the best all-civilian teams in the South.

The team left with Coach Norman Shepard for Raleigh Wednesday, played Virginia Polytechnic Institute last night, and hopes to beat
Carolina or the University of Richmond tonight. For several games, Mike Williams was out because of a sprained ankle. His
presence in the conference games will greatly increase the team’s chances of coming out on top.
