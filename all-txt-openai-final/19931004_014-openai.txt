**Volleyball finishes Davidson Classic Tournament with 1 win, 2 losses**

By Matt Pitzer

On Saturday, the volleyball team found itself down two sets to zero to UNC-Wilmington and ready to evoke remembrances of its stirring comeback victory against Mercer two weeks earlier. The Wildcats won the third set and played strongly in the fourth, but their effort fell short in the 15-13, 15-6, 12-15, 15-13 defeat to wind up the Davidson Classic tournament.

“I wish we were still playing right now,” coach Carolyn Blake said following the match. “It’s nice to see we have comeback ability. Obviously, we don’t want to get down like that, but it’s good to see we can come back.”

Davidson finished with a 1-2 record for the weekend, falling to 9-10 overall on the season. The Wildcats beat Western Carolina 8-15, 15-10, 15-10, 15-13 Friday before losing to tourney winner Virginia Commonwealth, 15-11, 15-13, 15-8.

Against Western Carolina, the Wildcats found themselves down 10-0 in the fourth game before they had a chance to serve the ball. But they came all the way back to take the game and the match.

“That is just the kind of effort we want to see against conference opponents,” Blake said.

Although the weekend results could have been better, Blake said she was pleased with the players’ individual efforts, especially Michele Augustin, Katherine Anderson, and Amy Howard. Carol Bitter played very strongly against Wilmington.

“She came in for us and lit a fire,” Blake said. “It was great to see her turn the momentum of the entire match around... Overall, there was nobody that hurt us. We all played pretty well.”

In Wilmington, the Wildcats played a team they hope to be similar to. Wilmington is a scrappy team that fights hard for every point, frequently frustrating its opponent. Davidson had a chance to take the first game, after taking a 13-12 lead. But Wilmington came back for the win. In the second game, the Wildcats did not appear very sharp.

“We weren’t playing our game,” Blake said. “We weren’t smart and we weren’t disciplined. We also missed a couple of serves.”

**Rugby pounds #3 Guilford**

By Dack Stackhouse

The Davidson College Rugby Football Club defeated third-ranked Guilford College on Saturday. The team was excited to host its first-ever match as a Division I team, and they performed well. The scoring began early when Derek Slayton kicked a penalty kick, putting the Wildcats up 3-0. Soon afterwards “Menacing” Mike Kessler, with the help of the entire scrum, bulldozed his way into Guilford’s try zone for the team’s first try of the day and Mike’s first-ever try. Slayton’s conversion brought the score to 10-0. The remainder of the first half was dominated by the Davidson team, but there were no more scores.

Davidson again dominated the second half. Mike “Double Zulu” Kessler picked up a loose ball and ran into the try zone for his second try of the day. With time running out, it seemed Davidson might earn a shutout against the number three team. However, Guilford progressed down the field. Davidson mounted an awesome goal line stand, denying entrance to the Guilford team despite their many opportunities. Edwin Thomas single-handedly stripped the ball from a scoring Guilford player, taking it upfield and out of danger. After a penalty against Guilford, Slayton added three more points to the Davidson score, making it 18-0. Just as the shutout seemed certain, Guilford was awarded a penalty kick, and they scored three points of their own as the final whistle blew.

The Davidson team has improved vastly in the past three weeks. Defeating the number three ranked team stands out as one of the team’s most impressive accomplishments. Every single member of the team deserves to be congratulated because each person has played an important role in the development of this fine team. If the team maintains its numbers and commitment at practice and in games, there will be no limit to its progress. As always, however, the team seeks to recruit new players. If you have any interest in playing, call Edwin Thomas at Ext. 6621.

**Men's soccer loses to UNC, beats Yale, 2-1; goalie Deegan injured**

By Will Cobb

The Davidson men’s soccer team hit a peak and a valley this past week on the road. While the Cats faced the fourth and fifth teams of their 6-game series of top 25 opponents, they suffered a big loss, gained a big victory, and left their record at 2-3 with one game left to play.

On Wednesday, the Cats traveled to Chapel Hill to face a strong, young team of Tarheels. Davidson made a quick start, getting a couple of good opportunities to score. Unfortunately, no goals were generated and the burst only got North Carolina fired up. The Tarheels then got settled down and turned it up, racking up goals for a 5-0 victory. This team was by far the best Davidson has faced all year long. The Tarheels had just come off a heartbreaking loss to Virginia, last year’s...National champions. North Carolina had a 2-1 lead at halftime, only to let the Cavaliers score twice in the last 6 minutes, the winning goal with 30 seconds left. With the loss, the Cats had to travel to Yale University for an out-of-region match on the road on Friday night. This game would be against yet another top 25 foe, but Davidson scratched early with less than 10 minutes into the game. Freshman Keith Kleeman took a corner kick that Fernando Campos headed to senior Andy Haile. Haile then gathered the assist by setting up Ben Hayes, who finished perfectly. Hayes, the senior captain scoring sensation, practically stripped the ball from Yale's goalie as he picked up the lazy roller. On the goal, Hayes commented that, "My foot just happened to be in the right place at the right time. With the loss of [All-American Rob] Ukrop, many of the goals aren't coming as easily as they seemed to last year, so we'll take whatever we can get." This lead held until late in the second half, when the Yale sweeper misplayed the ball to freshman Robert Clarke. The prolific high school scorer then went one-on-one with the keeper, putting the ball in the net for his first goal of the season. The 2-0 lead did not last for long as Yale took the kickoff down the field, scoring in less than 20 seconds. This goal got the fans and the team fired up, and Davidson held down a hard charge. With 10 minutes left in the game, goalie Alex Deegan came out of goal to tend to a corner kick. As he initially moved in one direction, but then back to the other, he twisted his knee severely and is expected to be out for at least the next three weeks. Neal Andrews filled in, playing excellently for the remainder of the game. The score held for a big 2-1 victory over a strong team out of the southern region. Yale plays similarly to Davidson and is also a young team. Like the Wake Forest game, Yale outshot Davidson considerably, but was not able to take advantage of its opportunities. “The win was not pretty,” said senior Andy Haile, “but this was a big win versus a good team, and we’ll take them anyway we can get them.” The victory brought the Cats to 5-5 on the season with a big match versus the powerful NC State Wolfpack this week. This will be a rematch from last year’s intense national quarterfinals, where the Cats came up with a 1-0 victory in overtime. The game will be this Thursday at 6:30 on Richardson Field. A victory would leave the Cats with a 3-3 record versus top 25 teams, a major success.

Much stronger in the third game, taking it 15-12. In the fourth game, they had a 12-10 lead and were tied at 13 before falling to lose the match. The difference was a variety of changes, Blake said. “We changed our lineups to get better matchups. We were a lot more positive, more aggressive, more disciplined.” Davidson is off for two weeks before embarking on a West Coast trip over Fall Break. There, the Wildcats will play UC-Irvine, Loyola Marymount, and Cal St.-Fullerton.

Women's soccer whips Ga. Southern, Radford
By Will Cobb

The Davidson women’s soccer team bounced back from a tough loss last week with two impressive victories in two days. The Cats hosted Radford University in a matchup featuring two similar programs. Unfortunately, Davidson came up short, falling 2-0, being held scoreless for the third straight game. The Wildcats came back on Saturday, though, with a 5-1 thrashing of Georgia Southern. Despite being shut out, they had their chances. With about twenty minutes left in the game, sophomore Shannon Lowrance took a shot from twenty yards out that hit the goalpost and fell in front of the goal. Though two of Davidson’s players were in the area, a goal could not be produced. This effort was the last attempt Davidson would have to score. The Wildcats hit the road for their next game against Southern Conference foe Georgia Southern. With several injuries, only twelve players suited up for the game, placing goalie Liz Schaper in the field. Despite adversity, Davidson pounded Georgia Southern 5-1, led by sophomore Heather Wineburg's two goals. Also adding goals were Sarah Cantrell, Claudia Lombard, and Ellen Sprinkle. This victory was big in its convincing style and gave the Cats confidence going into their next match against Liberty on Saturday. The Lady Cats delivered another beating with a 6-0 thrashing of Liberty College, scoring three times in the first ten minutes. Leslie Griner opened the scoring with a blast only 45 seconds into the game. Also scoring were Lombard, who looped a corner kick into the net for a humbling goal. Heather Wineburg, Sarah Cantrell, Jenny Satterfield, and Ellen Sprinkle also added goals to finish the scoring. This victory upped the team’s record to 6-3-1 on the season. The Cats will face UNC-Asheville on Wednesday away and then Virginia Tech on Friday away also. Their next home game will be on October 13 against ACC foe NC State.
