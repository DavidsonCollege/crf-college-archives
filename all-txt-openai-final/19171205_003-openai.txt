The DAVIDSONIAN, December 5, 1917

Class Championship Won By Junior Team
Were Undefeated During Class Tournament.

Last Tuesday evening found one of the most enthusiastic crowds at the Gym that has witnessed a basketball game this
year, the reason being that the Juniors and Fresh were to play off the tie which determined who would be
the champions for the coming year. When the whistle blew there were found ten determined boys on the floor. At
the beginning, Potts for the Juniors, and McCachren and Harrington for the Fresh, began to roll up the score. The
end of the first half found the Juniors slightly in the lead, but the Fresh were still hopeful. When the
whistle blew for the close of the last half, the Fresh found that the Juniors had outplayed them, winning by
the score of 34-30. Schenck and Harrington for the Fresh, Potts and Alexander for the Juniors, were the outstanding stars
of the game. The line-up was as follows:

JUNIORS. POSITION. FRESH.
Potts (7) .......... Center .......... Cox (2)
T. R. Alexander (3) .......... McCachren (5)
W. P. Davenport (4) .......... Collins (2)
Forwards

in the contest. They delivered their speeches in a manner which indicates that there is much material for good speakers
in these two classes. The judges awarded the medal to D. M. Chalmers, ’20, who spoke on “The Destiny of
America.”

SCRUBS ARE DEFEATED BY ASHEVILLE SCHOOL
In a hard-fought game, playedon a quickly and muddy field, the Bingham School defeated the Davidson Scrubs Thanksgiving day by
the score of 13 to 6. Both teams used straight football throughout, the condition of the field making end runs
and forward passes dangerous. Bingham began early in the first quarter to buck the line and scored two touchdowns on
line plunges. Purdy carried the ball across for the first touchdown, Brooks followed a few minutes later for the second,
and Oates kicked one goal from touchdown. Davidson scored also in this quarter, Brown carrying the ball across on a
forward pass from Pat Robeson after the ball had been brought within scoring distance by line plunges. For Bingham, Purdy
and Jarvis played especially well, while the stars for the Scrubs were Fischel, Robson, and Brown. The line-up follows:

BINGHAM. POSITION. SCRUBS.
Steinbeck ...... RE ...... Thompson
Becker ........ RT ...... Fowle
Buie .......... RG ...... Mountcastle
Brown ......... C ....... Miley
Jarvis ......... LG ...... G. Robson
Ligon ......... LT ...... A. G. Finley
Sanford ....... LE ...... Brown
Hicks ......... QB ...... C. Robson
Brooks ........ FB ...... Fischel
Oates ......... RH ...... Walker
Purdy ......... LH ...... Hall
