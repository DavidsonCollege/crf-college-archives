DR. McCONNELL VISITS N.Y.
Dr. J. W. McConnell returned last week from a visit to the Adirondack Cottage Sanatorium, Trudeau, N.Y. Dr. Porter P.
Vinson is assistant resident physician of the sanitarium, and is achieving prominence by his work. A number of Davidsonians there
were very much interested in the success of the Davidson football team, watching the papers for news of the Davidson-Carolina
game. All seemed to be well pleased with the score. "Dusty" Sherrill, formerly captain of Davidson's baseball team, is a
patient there, and is making some progress. Other Davidson patients are Wallace Long ('09), who is now cured, and Mr.
D. F. Brown, former superintendent of buildings and grounds. Deer hunting is at its height in the Adirondacks, and Dr.
Vinson is hoping to have a trophy soon. Tom Dixon, the author and playwright, is planning a hunting trip to
Davidson as the guest of Dr. J. W. McConnell. He is at present having the "Clansman" made into a photo-drama,
the production of which will cost $50,000. Dr. Dixon's last appearance at Davidson was as a campaign orator against Mr.
Gudger. Dr. J. W. McConnell, during his visit to Trudeau, was in an automobile smash-up, which luckily he and the
other occupants of the car escaped unhurt. Dr. Heise and Dr. Porter Vinson, of the Sanitarium, together with Dr. McConnell
and the chauffeur, were driving in a car when another machine coming down the street crashed into the car, staving
in the side and smashing up the front of the other automobile. It was a very narrow escape.

Saturday Afternoon, Nov. 28, 2:45 p.m.—Music, Invocation: M. T. Shirley, The American Flag; J. G. Stewart.
