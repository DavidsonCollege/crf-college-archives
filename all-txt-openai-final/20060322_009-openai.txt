SGA candidate promises better weather for the remainder of semester

Rob York ’08 celebrated his victory as Junior Class President by immediately getting to work on his proposed programs. SGA elections this year were characterized by a call from voters to fulfill campaign promises; York is visibly responding to the strong student demand for immediate action.

York’s platform rested on two major issues. First, York said, he will “work to ensure sunnier weather and warmer temperatures as the spring semester goes on.” Secondly, he hopes to promote the interests and well-being of students with low motivation and poor work habits. The weather issue received a great deal of attention from voters and is thought to have made the difference in the election.

“These cold and rainy days are a downer for everyone,” York said. “SGA is supposed to act as the voice and the arm of the student body, and the lack of effort to get spring weather here by springtime represents a failure on the part of SGA.”

York’s other promise, to provide a voice to alternative work styles, has also been kick-started by his administration. His proposals included holding seminars on procrastination and convenient lapses in memory.

“Students should be aware of the options they have,” he said. “The Union is full of things to do instead of homework, to say nothing of what Patterson Court and the senior apartments offer.”

While support won York the election, his critics have been outspoken in their questioning of his ability to really carry through on such promises.

Rob York ‘08 promises that blizzards like this and other unpleasant weather conditions will be a thing of the past now that he is SGA president.

Townies: A talk with the owner of the Lake Norman Monster museum

The Yowl: In this edition of Townies, The Yowl interviews Roger Barney, the owner of “eNORMous,” the new museum dedicated to Norm, the fabled Lake Norman Monster. Roger, thanks for meeting with us.

Roger Barney: Of course. It’s my pleasure to introduce your readers to Norm, Lake Norman’s most famous prehistoric inhabitant.

TY: What can you tell us about Norm?

RB: Well, to be honest, we don’t know too much about him. And, as a disclaimer to your readers, most of what we know has either probably been made up or is most definitely a lie.

TY: Lies? How could you have created a museum then, if you admit the whole concept is a fictional story?

RB: Oh, that’s simple. My museum, eNORMous, documents and puts on exhibit the various tall tales, fables, yarns, folk stories and drunken or demented screaming gibberish told about the Lake Norman Monster.

TY: Ah, I get it. The museum is really just a bit of fun that you’re having with a famous story.

RB: That’s where you’re wrong, mister. The backcountry yokels regard their babblings with the utmost seriousness. You would find yourself in the midst of a heated exchange, and probably on the wrong end of a shotgun, should you ever try to call them out on their obviously false, imagined or hallucinated sightings.

TY: What causes these hallucinations, these sightings?

RB: Moonshine, mostly. Also, hillbillies have an inherent craving for attention. But mostly moonshine.

TY: Can you describe what people think the monster looks like?

Barney shows off a fish that would be a satisfying appetizer for Norm, the Lake Norman Monster.

RB: Norm’s been spotted by hundreds of country folk since the lake was created in the 1960s, and he’s rumored to be over 100 yards long, covered in green scales and the owner of hundreds to thousands of rows of sharp teeth. Overall, Norm seems to be a fine specimen with typical monstrous attributes.

TY: How did Norm come to inhabit a relatively unknown, manmade body of water like Lake Norman?

RB: One local Norm historian, Sam the Spitting Drunk, says...That during the Carter Administration, General Robert E. Lee’s spirit took the form of a lake monster in order to bring fame to the South, and ultimately, to overthrow Carter and start a new underwater Confederacy. Another scholar, One-Eyed Moonshine Willie, believes that Norm is a secret government experiment created to battle colossal catfish with supernatural psychic powers planted by the Communists to discover the recipe to his grits. The C.I.A. found the catfish after they built Lake Norman and alerted Willie to their whereabouts before they swore to protect him.

TY: Sounds fascinating. What else can we expect to find in your museum?

RB: We’ll have various drawings of Norm and pictures of locals holding out their arms as far as they can in order to describe how big they think Norm is. Also, I hope to always have at least one drunken hillbilly available to entertain museum-goers with a story of a recent sighting, most likely one that he will be making up as he goes.

TY: Thank you for your time, Mr. Barney, and good luck with your museum.

RB: It’s my pleasure. Now, make sure you watch for Moonshine Willie on your way out. He’s been known to shoot on sight.

Townies is a Yowl series featuring interviews with prominent local personalities.

Great enthusiasm. The Board of question of whether to meetings before and all that has happened has been to appoint a committee to look into it. By the time the committee reaches any conclusions, the problem seems to have taken care of itself. Other senators have voiced concerns that in the four short days since York’s election, forces outside SGA have begun making changes in the student performers as entertainment.

“I was really impressed with the turnout,” said Ginnie Roberson ’08. “Everyone was at their best: the performers hadn’t practiced, the food was barely even halfway coordinated and in some cases, still completely frozen. Also, Rob had not worked on a speech at all.”

“It’s time that SGA represented all the students at Davidson. Until now, everyone on SGA has been an industrious, hardworking student with academic prowess. What about the drunks? The slackers? The people who are always in their professor’s office at 4:50 pleading for an extension? These students, who have never been able to get someone elected, need a voice,” said York.

Weather. “Monday was one of the sunniest days on record for this time of year,” said Parker Tipton ’09. “I think Rob may have missed the boat on this issue; it looks like it might already be taken care of.”

York’s alternative work style platform, by contrast, has been met with spring weather here by springtime is a failure. York has scheduled an effort to get open forum discussion of the spring weather issue for Sat., Apr. 1, in Room 313 in the Union. He has not set a date yet for his first alternative work of the SGA. Laziness and Apathy for Health (BLAH) held a celebration of York’s election in the 900 Room Saturday afternoon, featuring performers as entertainment.
