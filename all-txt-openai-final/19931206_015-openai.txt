Turnovers - Samford 20, Davidson 18

By Robert Lloyd-Still

Defensive pressure and offensive balance have provided the Wildcats with a perfect season so far. In their first four matches, Davidson has defeated the Charlotte Royals, University of the South, the Italian National Team, and Samford. On Saturday night, the Cats drilled the Samford Bulldogs 78-51.

Davidson’s defense dominated the Bulldogs. Wildcat point guard Chris Alpert provided the pressure and the Cats defense caused 20 turnovers, which led to numerous scoring opportunities. With that type of defense and the addition of the 35-second shot clock this season, the Bulldogs were unable to execute offensively. Samford threw up 23 three-pointers, most times out of pure desperation. Joey Davenport was the lone bright spot for the Bulldogs, scoring 14 points. For the game, Samford shot 40% from the field, while the Cats shot 51.7%.

While Samford struggled to convert a pass, Davidson seemed to do whatever, whenever they pleased. Two tremendous dunks sparked Davidson in both halves. Shortly into the first half with the Cats down 5-0, Brandon Williams got the Cats going with a breakaway slam. The next dunk, ten minutes into the second half, occurred when Jeff Anderson hit Mark McGuire on a thundering, alley-oop dunk. That dunk was the exclamation point on a well-played night for the Wildcats.

Coach McKillop stated, “I’m most delighted with our effort. If it becomes a constant, we’re going to have a very enjoyable season. There’s a better bounce in their step, more muscle on their bodies and it’s obvious in the way they are playing.”

Davidson’s size helped them against the smaller Bulldogs. Throughout the night, the Cats scored at will, from inside or out. Senior Janko Narat led the Cats with 14 points and 11 rebounds. Alpert added 12 points.5-6 shooting. Williams scored 11, McGuire 10, and Harwood, Zimmerman, and Spain each scored 8. All of this showed the balanced offensive attack this year. In the next two weeks, Davidson will face the stiffest competition of the season. On Monday night, the Cats travel to Winston-Salem to face Wake Forest. And then in two weeks, the Cats will face some other ACC opponents, Clemson and N.C. State.

Friends: Davidsonian
By Will Cobb

The story of the weekend would be Virginia’s junior forward Nate Friends of Vienna, Va., who scored all five of the Cavalier’s goals. With most of the opposition’s attention on the sensation Claudio Reyna and offensive threat A.J. Wood, Friends was able to run loose and make the big plays for the Wahoos. Entering the weekend with only 7 goals this season, the five goals were definitely a surprise. “I thought I would score this weekend, but as long as we win I don’t care who scores,” said Friends. “If we had lost and I had scored five goals, I wouldn’t be that happy... It feels good to have been a positive contribution to this championship team.”

Friends decided to play soccer at Virginia during the summer following his senior year of high school. Though he was recruited, he was not on scholarship, and had to decide between basketball and soccer. Being the son of a college basketball player at the University of Chicago-Loyola, Friends inherited basketball skills that convinced schools such as William and Mary and the Naval Academy to recruit him. He decided to play at Virginia with the hopes of winning a national title while receiving an excellent education at one of the nation's finest research institutions. He now has three national championships, and with his government major, plans to pursue a law degree.

Still, the sport of soccer is a team sport, and the congratulations should be given to the whole team, not to one individual player. Friends knows that as well as anybody. All five of his goals were assisted, which is a tribute to the teamwork style of play that Virginia instills in its players. Even with the probable exit of star Claudio Reyna, Friends does not consider himself to be the leader of next year's squad. Maybe he is just modest, because he sure is a class act.
