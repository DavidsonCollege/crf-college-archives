Commission Chooses Masquers Opening Play

Y.M.C.A. and Masquers To Sponsor Talks By Authorities on Drama

“There Shall Be No Night” by Alfred Tount will be the play presented this fall by the Masquers. The Y.M.C.A. and Masquers are working together to bring prominent authorities on drama to speak. The play will be held three weeks from now, and the exact date will be announced later.

New Men Take Up Journalism
By JOHN NORTHCROSS

What else is a classic newspaper tale? The page is nothing but a setup of The Davidsonian this fall. Johnsen and Walt, in fast melodrama, might get a note from the editor's office on a Monday night while the ink flows, the typewriter hums, and the reporters pound. A dozen new freshmen, green but eager, mill around the office looking for jobs, headlines to sweat out. The new boys, eager for a story to cover, are as varied a group as can be found anywhere. Some lean towards chemistry, some toward insurance, anything from zoology to tightrope walking; but all of them have one thing in common: they want to write.

Ambitions

One is Jim Stinson, who is interested mainly in psychology, this business of growing up. Leonard Pharr says he's interested in any sort of sport. He edited the sports section of his school paper. Beverly Brown wants to out-fiddle Jimmy Fidler when he gets his regular dirt-digging column in print. Charles Brockman is a future war correspondent, youngish, always smiling. Frank Smith wants experience in writing that he can use seriously later on. Howell Morrow is headed for the Bar.

Two of the boys will be ministers, William Abbott and John Murray. Peck Hill intends to become a chemist. Buddy Carson will go into insurance with his father. Leon Drake wants to go in for diplomatic service. Tommy Raymond’s interest has always been medicine; he hopes to enter Johns Hopkins.

In the picture, one of the world’s smallest drum majors is seen leading the college band between the halves of the V.M.I. game at the Legion Memorial Stadium in Charlotte last Saturday afternoon. This is the fourth year Master Vernon Lassiter, Jr., has led the Davidson Band. Vernon is the seven-year-old son of Dr. Vernon Lassiter of Winston-Salem and is a nephew of Mr. J. C. Pfohl, director of music at Queens College in Charlotte and at Davidson.
