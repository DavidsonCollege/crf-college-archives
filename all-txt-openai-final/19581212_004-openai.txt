Pictured in front of the new library wing is the excavation on the projected Dana Science Hall. The building, to stand between the library and the college church, is made possible through the donation of $400,000 by Mr. Charles A. Dana. This is the largest donation ever made by a living donor.

**Davidson Gift Funds Extend Around World**

Effects of past Davidson College Gift Funds are still being felt both in our own community and around the world. By its very nature, the Gift Fund is in a position to aid a particular need or several diverse ones which support another body or section of the country. In the years following World War II, the Gift Fund often went to relieve a desperate need, whether in Europe or in Asia.

In 1948, the Gift Fund provided $6,000 to purchase food and medical supplies for the students of Marburg University in Germany, and in 1949 it helped in the reconstruction of the YMCA's Boy's Camp on Noilo Island in the Philippines.

One of the most lasting programs set up by a Gift Fund was begun in 1950 to alleviate the slum housing conditions for the Negroes of Davidson. A guarantee fund was set up so that the bank could grant a mortgage to Negroes with the assurance that if the persons would not be able to repay the loan, the Gift Fund would take care of the debt. However, several years ago the bank said that the money would no longer be needed and the money reverted to the YMCA. This money has been made available to worthy Davidson Negro students to assist them in their college careers and has been called the Davidson College YMCA Negro Student Loan Fund. This semester alone, six students are partly supported from loans from this fund, begun eight years ago.

In 1951, the Gift Fund was split between the Caswell Training School for the physically and mentally retarded and a program to aid the food shortage in India by instructing farmers on how to improve their crop production.

Many Korean amputees, both children and adults, received artificial limbs, orthopedic operations, and vocational training as a result of the 1952 appeal. YMCA Community Service projects, such as movies, discussion groups, and Boy Scouts, take place in a community center building provided by the 1953 Gift Fund.

Two Greek agricultural specialists received their complete years’ salaries for going from town to town in northern Greece to teach up-to-date agricultural methods as a result of the 1954 Gift Fund.

The proceeds from the 1955 Gift Fund were divided between Charlotte’s Alexander Home and radio stations DYSR, DYB4, and OYH-4 in Dumaguete City in the Philippines. With their portion of the fund, the Alexander Home for emotionally disturbed children completely outfitted their playground with desperately needed equipment. The radio stations, which present educational, religious, and news programs from 5 a.m. to 10 p.m., replaced their broken-down shortwave transmitter with a new 2-kilowatt one and distributed fifty receivers to the remotest areas of the Islands. Dr. Henry W. Mack, the director of the radio stations run in cooperation with Silliman University, is the father of Robert Mack, who graduated from Davidson in 1956.

An immediate and living example of Gift Fund effect in our community is the Hocsak family who escaped from revolt-torn Hungary in 1956. The Gift Fund took care of their expenses and gave them a new beginning in a strange land.

One million pounds of food was packaged and sent to needy areas of the world as a result of last year's Share Our Surplus program.

As one can readily see, the effects of every Gift Fund have been profound and meaningful to those intimately connected with them. Let us bear this in mind as we reach for our checkbooks when we are asked to support this Davidson tradition.

The American people for years have given their approval to Latin and South American music. Zamba, Rhumba, Mambo, and Cha-Cha have been favorites because of their gaiety and appealing rhythm. All the republics “south of the border” have their national dances, some being “Joropo,” the dance of Venezuela, the

**Anderson Clarifies IFC, ROTC Hold Preferential Stand Fall Blood Drive**

“Our proposed preferential bidding system is almost identical to one being used in a vast majority of other colleges and universities in the country,” Interfraternity Council President Vernon Anderson disclosed at Monday’s meeting of the IFC.

The American Red Cross Bloodmobile will be open from eleven o’clock until four-thirty for those students who wish to donate blood. Students having labs or afternoon classes may donate after theRegular closing hour. FREE CUTS All those giving blood will receive a free ROTC drill cut and a free physical education cut. In addition, the fraternity having the highest percentage of donors will be awarded the IFC Blood Drive Plaque. Only those actually giving blood will receive credit for the cuts or plaque. Donors will be eligible for the next six months to receive free blood at hospitals which are members of the Red Cross Blood Bank. Anyone under twenty-one will not be allowed to give blood without a release signed by his parents. The ROTC Department and the IFC have co-operated in distributing registration cards and permission forms for students under twenty-one. 

IFC ENCOURAGES DONORS “The IFC," said President Vernon Anderson, “encourages all students to participate in this drive. Not only will the fraternity receive credit but the cause itself is a worthy one.”

Bar-Illan (Continued From Page 1) to the virtuoso tradition, and his technique made him capable of handling it well. Everything he played was sharp and concise; in fact, at times he seemed to lack restraint in the matter of creating a sparkling line. He played a fast program, and usually faster than the composer intended. The music sometimes sounded like a recording played at the wrong speed. Bar-Illan did not lack judgment or taste, though he probably would not have given such a one-sided concert in Carnegie Hall. Perhaps he assumed the Yankee attitude that Southern musical culture is immature and only as deep as a fast, loud, or rippling showpiece. And there is always the disgusting possibility that he is right.

Due to strong student demand, the administration has announced that there will be no chapel next Friday morning. The remainder of the schedule is unchanged.

Four field goals in one game by a man who'd never kicked one before! Bobby Conrad himself said, “I never kicked a field goal in high school or college. In fact, I never even tried.” But the amazing Texas A&M back broke all-star records by booting four three-pointers, including one for 44 yards, as the 1958 college stars upset the Detroit Lions, 35 to 19. Conrad is now a Chicago Cardinal.

The well-known “Zamba” in Brazil; movements of the body which signified their opinion of the laughable customs of their own and the “Tamborito,” Panama’s national dance. Because I’m sure that no one here in Davidson has ever heard of it before, “El Tamborito” and its origin will be the topic of this column. The “Tamborito” originates with the primitive dances of the slaves who were brought to Panama by the early “conquistadores.” Gradually it has taken on new character until it is now a strange medley of modern coquetry overlaid on a background of primitive sinuous movements and expressive of this most cosmopolitan country.

Centuries ago when the slaves were first brought to Panama to work on the great “haciendas,” the masters sometimes gave them permission to hold gatherings in the yards and in the mines. At these gatherings, the slaves amused themselves by dancing, and into these dances they wove their homesickness for their native Africa, their despair at their lost liberty, and their remembrances of their lost mode of life. Thus they solaced their unhappiness with the weird music of their drums, their incomprehensible songs, and their primitive dance routines. The simple originators of the “Tamborito” had a primitive sense of humor which took the form of mimicking their masters. When caught in this pastime, they excused their rude behavior by saying they were merely imitating the customs of their own people.

It was a long time afterwards when the mixture of the slaves with their Spanish owners had produced the race known as “criollos” that these dances were modified for more sensitive audiences and the “Tamborito” moved from the yards and the mines into the patios of the criollo homes. The themes of the songs became corrupted and new lyrics were invented. There were happy songs and sad songs, songs of love and of hate, and also songs which were merely witty take-offs. It was during this period that the “Pollera” (the costume now in use) took the place of the rags of the slaves. With the introduction of this beautiful full-skirted costume, of which we will talk about later, the “Tamborito” acquired the grace it still has today.

The 20th century has already added the music of the flute, the cornet, accordion or organ, and bass violin to the drums. And so the “Tamborito” grows—a dance of life and beauty; it expands to embrace new customs, to add to the subject of its lyrics and to change its music. But still it retains forever the wild beat of the drums.

FURTHER STUDY Anderson pointed out, however, that further study and consideration of the proposed system will have to continue “for some time” before any decisive action is taken to replace the present system of bidding. The IFC also considered this week the possibility of including as part of future Homecoming weekends in the fall a Homecoming Queen to be presented during half-time ceremonies of the football game. One proposal is to allow each fraternity to elect a candidate, with the IFC selecting the Queen. No decision has been made on this plan, however.
