#### What They’re Saying

“Grade inflation, by definition, involves a rise in grades without a concurrent rise in student performance.”
—Hadley & Vitale, 1985, as reported in the Texas Education Review

“If you take out the exceptions like Harvard, we are not far out of line with the rest of the country.”
—Hansford Epes, Davidson Registrar

“And it positions Princeton to take national leadership in tackling what has seemed an intractable national problem.”
—Princeton Dean of the College Nancy Malkiel, on passing the proposal

“Princeton [is] taking risks to fix a problem. But it’s also image management... Is it an academic question or a PR question?”
—Davidson Director of Career Services John Adams

“‘Anywhere else it would’ve been an A.’... B on your paper? Could’ve, should’ve been an A. Can't pass the swim test? Go splashing anywhere else.”
—Opening paragraph of Swarthmore’s The Phoenix article on grade inflation

“It'll be like the nuclear arms race, but with people hoarding A’s instead of weapons.”
—Princeton freshman Vera Dadok, on increased academic competition as a result of the just-passed faculty proposal assigning grade expectations

“I think it is perfectly reasonable that the faculty should say that only around a third of work generally deserves an A, and to recalibrate grades to that standard.”
—Princeton freshman Charlie Stone, on the same proposal

#### Gender Gap in Average GPA, Women Higher

An investigation into historical GPA data provided by the Registrar’s Office has turned up a surprising result: the average of women’s GPA is consistently higher than the average of all-students GPA and the average of all men’s GPA. The differences ranged from 0.066 to 0.257 points in any given year, with the mean difference being 0.157 points.

What could be causing the disparity? Davidson’s gender equity policy in Admissions might be culpable. Davidson students commented on whether they think girls are studying harder than guys, vice versa, or no difference. But two professors speculated on causes other than women being smarter or studying harder than men.

Dean of Faculty Clark Ross said, “If there is a statistically significant difference by gender, the obvious question is why. I suspect there are different hypotheses one could test.” Ross proposed testing for group differences in ability, time spent studying, and course and major selection.

Dr. David Martin, also an Economics professor, suggested another important factor could be, “If one gender goes abroad to non-Davidson programs more than the other, then that gender will have more pass-fails on record than the other.”

All theories are plausible conjecture to explain away some or all of the difference. No data was available to test them at the time of press.

Students offered conflicting answers when asked if women study harder to get better grades than men. Carrington Skinner ’07 said, “I think girls work much harder and stress much more than guys at Davidson from my perspective. Though I noticed trends like this in high school, it seems to be almost across the board here at Davidson.”

Anne Hedgepath ’07 disagreed, saying, “Girls tend to be much more vocal about their stress, from my experience... [but] at Davidson I think most people work the same amount.”

Michael Galdo ’04 emphasized the inability to make a direct comparison. He said, “My gut reaction is that the girls I know stress about grades a bit more, but the more I think about it the more I realize it’s impossible to make a generalization about the issue.”

The issue is made more salient when put in the perspective of Davidson’s gender policy in Admissions. The Board of Trustees-mandated policy insists on maintaining a gender balance of 50-50 women-to-men over the four classes. While most faculty and administrators defend the policy, some have criticized it because the admissions pool is frequently much more competitive for women, as they outnumber men in applicants but equal them in spots.

In the February 11, 2004 issue of The Davidsonian, President Vagt defended the policy in part by saying, “At the end of the day... you do not have a situation where men are at the bottom of the GPA totem pole... if that were the case, [the system] would be unfair.”

In response to these latest findings, Vagt said, “My comment was intended to extend to a disparity that was bigger than [the gap that was found].”

The difference occurred in all 28 years for which data was available, going back to 1980 and including the four current undergraduate classes. A quick analysis using statistical techniques found the difference to be statistically significant, though not a very good predictor—in essence, one may conclude that the average of women’s GPA is higher than men’s, but not that being female will result in a high GPA.

In addition, the difference was noted in six of the seven most popular majors of the graduating classes of 2002 and 2003. These findings were not tested for significance. In 2002, women were higher in Biology, English, History, Mathematics, Political Science, and Psychology, while men had a higher average in Economics. In 2003, women were higher in Biology, Economics, English, History, Psychology, and Religion, while men were higher in Political Science.

#### Grades, from page 1
South,” need tobe worried about going the way of its northern counterpart? Probably not. In the last 25 years, Davidson faculty added their perspectives on grade inflation, both as Davidson professors and coming out of high-caliber graduate programs. Assistant Professor of French and Humanities Leon Sachs, now in his second year at Davidson, said, “If we inflate/compress grades, then we are diminishing the value of an ‘A’ relative to a ‘B’ in our own institution. This, in my mind, is a huge problem.” —Assistant Professor of Economics Fred Smith, in his fourth year, spoke of their own grading standards and expectations of their respective departments.

Sachs first emphasized the difficulty in quantifying the evaluation process in a literature class, and the resulting grade, an easier task for disciplines that are more right-or-wrong than the humanities, such as math and the natural sciences. Both denied a formal grade distribution policy in their departments but admitted having conversations with long-established colleagues on the subject.

“No department policy has been communicated to me,” Sachs said. “We get a print-out sometime during the following semester of my grades compared to my colleagues.” He said the department chair has indicated to him his grading in the past two years is not out of line with others in the French department, and Sachs indicated if that were the case it might be communicated to him. Smith said, “I have discussed grading issues with several of my colleagues, but I have never been ‘influenced’ in a negative way by any of my colleagues... [T]here has never been any pressure placed on me to hit a ‘grade target,’ and there has never been any ‘advice’ given in the form of an unstated ‘requirement.’”

But Sachs recalled that during his initial orientation, Ross told all new faculty “to challenge our students.” Sachs said, “I believe that came in the same breath as don’t inflate grades.” In giving an “unsupported opinion,” Smith said, “The problem with the current system [at other schools], though, is that you have inflation combined with a ‘price ceiling’ of sorts,” using Economics jargon for an absolute maximum boundary that cannot be exceeded. Smith said, “There are no grades to hand out higher than ‘A’. So if we inflate/compress grades, then we are diminishing the value of an ‘A’ relative to a ‘B’ in our own institution. This, in my mind, is a huge problem.”

Does major impact GPA? Some departments have come to acquire a reputation for being more difficult than others, or at least having a lower GPA. Math, Economics, the natural sciences, and Religion are frequently counted by students among these majors. Ross would not confirm or deny if the data supported these perceptions. Ross said, “I think that [a department’s average GPA] can be misleading. It can relate to the structure of the major.” He explained that a department’s average GPA may be low while the same is not true of its majors, largely because the material in introductory-level courses may produce a disparity of grades. “When I think of the Chemistry majors, and there aren’t that many, they are going on to some of the best graduate programs in the country. [Or] if you look at Phi Beta Kappa... You will not find that Phi Beta Kappa is disproportionately populated by departments with high GPAs.”

Speaking from his teaching experience as a graduate student at Yale, Sachs said, “Despite all the statistics, I’m not convinced that a grade inflation problem exists” to the degree some alarmists claim, even at the Ivy League schools. “In my own classroom, a grade evaluates the work and communicates something to the student,” Sachs said. On that basis, Ross declined to release the data the Academic Affairs office maintains on departmental GPA, saying it would not be appropriate. “In the end, it’s not departments, it’s individuals that give grades,” Ross said. Vagt said, “I really think that every faculty member ought to have the right to grade as they see fit. I do realize that doesn’t happen in a vacuum.”
