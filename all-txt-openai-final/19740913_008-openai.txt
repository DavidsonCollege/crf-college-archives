With the help of funds donated by the Davidson Wildcat Club, the Cat Basketball team will be playing on a
new rubberized gym floor this year. Due to be completed by Oct. 1, the beige with black and red trimmed
Tartan surface will hopefully provide a more efficient playing surface.

According to Davidson Sports Information Director Emil Parker, “Last year the budget was unable to afford the new floor, so
the Wildcat Club raised the necessary $64,000.”

Davidson Basketball Coach Bo Brickels is also extremely pleased with the new Tartan surface. “I think that new surface will
not only benefit the performances of the players, but it will definitely aid in recruiting,” Brickels said.

At present, the gym floor is only concrete. The concrete must set for a period of roughly 28 days after
it has been poured.

“With this new floor additional striping may be put down for IMAC basketball and volleyball games,” said Parker.

The new gym floor is not the only improvement planned for Johnston Gymnasium. Construction is now underway for three offices
and a conference room downstairs.

The offices will house Wrestling Coach Charles Parker, Director of Physical Education Chip Stone, and the new Director of Women’s
Physical Education Pat Drake.

In addition to these improvements, plans are being considered for the redecoration of the back wall of the gym.

Administrative Changes

(Continued from page 1)

The two will be replaced by Brenda Parnell and Duff Bruce. Parnell has recently served as admissions secretary for Duke
University Law School, while Bruce has served as assistant to the president and assistant director of the College Union, respectively
during the past two years.

“It is a real advantage to have someone in the admissions department who has a real knowledge of what the
college is and a devotion to it, both qualities which Duff has,” Spencer said.

With such a background, Spencer feels Bruce is in a position “to interpret the campus” for prospective students.

Strong’s new position was a move upward, as Wake Forest has a large information staff with its own printing facilities.
Strong will be replaced by Martha Byrd. Spencer indicated that Davidson is “really fortunate to have her.” She has written
two books as well as edited several publications. “Her credentials certainly rate her well for the position,” Spencer said.

Two members of the admissions department left Davidson during the summer. William Miller accepted the responsibilities of director of financial
aid at Old Dominion University, while Mariam Nolan returned to graduate school at Harvard University.
