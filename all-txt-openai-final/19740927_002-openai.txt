**An Interview With C. David Cornell**

**Cornell Cautions Davidson Of Severe Financial Drought**

By MATTHEW COVINGTON
Asst. Managing Editor

The departure of C. David Cornell from Davidson and from his post here as vice-president for finance and development will
cause the college to undergo certain processes of financial reorganization. Reached at his new office in California, Cornell commented on
the future of Davidson finance.

“As for this coming year, the one you are in now, it’s going to be tight. Last year we were
able to put pledges for the new library into short-term investments, sometimes earning as much as 11 percent in interest.
This year that money won’t be available because you will be paying for the library.

“We were able to make between $250,000 and $300,000 in paper last year,” he continued. “That money will have to
come from somewhere this year.”

“Fiscal year 76 looks worse. The trustees have frozen tuition for two years. We were able, through shrewd management, to
have money for salary increases both of those years. That translates to about a $500,000 increase in compensation in two
years with no increase in tuition.

“In order to do the same things in ’76,” Cornell explained, “the tuition would have to be increased about $500.
The trustees won’t accept this kind of jump, I don’t believe, so some expenditures will have to be cut. So,
do you cut academic funds, administrative funds...athletic funds? What do you cut?”

Cornell warns that unless something is done in the way of substantially increasing the endowment, or cutting some important expenses,
Davidson could be down by as much as $1,000,000 in ’76. “The next 18 months will set the entire future.
Spencer has some decisions to make. You look at ’76 and beyond and it’s a great big question mark,” said
Cornell.

Cornell expressed some disdain for the lack of manpower in the financial staff. “Four years ago, when I came to
the school, I was told that I could hire three other people to help me. I never got more than
two at one time and there was no great permanence about the people that I had.”

“As a result of this lack of manpower, we ended up raising $3,000,000 last year for ridiculously little. According to
the best manning tables I can find based on national experience, it takes about 23 cents to raise a dollar
most places. At Davidson, we were spending about eight cents to make a dollar.

“In order to raise $2,000,000 at most schools, a staff of nine full-time people must be maintained,” Cornell said. “My
count for last year, when we raised $3,000,000 shows only 8. My time was divided between development and finance, so
I counted myself as a half.”

Cornell feels that having one man heading finance and development was a good idea. “Let’s look at the record,” he
pointed out. “While I was at Davidson, we were in the black each year.”

“I agree with the one-person idea. It worked. But one man needs a staff. Having a man report directly to
Spencer won’t help unless the man has a staff,” Cornell added.

“Spencer works best, at least in his own mind, when he has a lot of people reporting to him. He
is much more interested in day-to-day details than I would be if I were president. I wouldn’t worry about whether
or not the tree limbs were too low. Spencer did this and Grover Meetze can confirm it,” Cornell claimed.

Cornell quoted one of his old professors, Howard (Howdy) Koontz, the Mead Johnson Professor of Management at U.C.L.A. “The art
of management is the art of getting things done through other people. Spencer isn’t willing to do this. He wants
to get into details. The men who replace me will have to realize that they must function in an area
that will allow the president to get into a lot of details.”

"Is it important enough for the college to move in the direction of building and running a 50,000 watt, non-commercial
stereo FM radio station," asked College President Samuel R. Spencer Jr. Spencer indicated that Davidson has made a continual recession
from the public awareness of the Charlotte area.

The Davidson College Board of Trustees at its summer meeting raised the question as to what contribution Davidson can make
to the Charlotte community at large that will increase public awareness of the college as a quality educational institution.

The convocation ceremonies will be the culmination of involvements, donations, and expectations involving the entire Davidson community. Principal speaker at
the event will be Dr. Louis B. Wright, director emeritus of the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington D.C. and a
noted historian. E.L.H. Little, long-time friend and honorary graduate of Davidson, who donated a great part of the cost of
the $4.2 million library, is expected to make some remarks. The convocation is "his day," said College President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr. "The library is an important addition to Davidson, in a way the most important building to the college,"
Spencer said. Spencer indicated that the library will enhance not only the image of the college, but also student life
and horizons. "The present 200,000 book collection has space to grow in — enough to accommodate an eventual half-million volumes,"
Spencer added. The names of contributors will be made available to the public and will be placed in the cornerstone
of the building as a time capsule designed to perpetuate the gratitude of the college to its supporters. Convocation ceremonies
will be integrated with Parent’s Weekend.

The Trustees noted there has been a substantial demand for a classical radio station in the Charlotte area for some
time. President of Union Theological Seminary and Davidson Trustee Fred Stair urged that the Trustees consider building just such a
classical radio station. Stair explained how Union had recently felt that it was relatively unknown to its Richmond, Va. community
until it established its own 50,000 watt FM stereo station, WRFK. WRFK in this last year claims to have had
between 60 and 70 percent of its yearly operating budget of about $50,000 met by direct listener contributions to the
station. According to Stair, Union’s community relations have never been better due to the seminary being associated with a highly
professional and culturally-oriented station operation. He added that WRFK hopes to be entirely listener-supported next year.

Spencer said that the Trustees favored the idea of building a station of the scope of WRFK or Wake Forest’s
WFDD as it apparently shows promise of being self-sustaining financially, as well as seeming to be the answer to Davidson’s
alleged locally diminished public image. If the Trustees make the decision to approve the building of a 50,000 watt station
at Davidson at their October meeting, two alternatives for the future of the current ten watt station are seen by
WDAV’s Executive Director Earl W. Lawrimore. If it were found to be legal for Davidson to operate two FM stations,
Lawrimore feels that the basically rock-oriented program could be continued as it presently operates. Lawrimore believes that the legality of
that plan is doubtful. If that is true, the station can re-institute its carrier-current AM equipment. "In either case," said
Lawrimore, "students would be employed as much as possible in the announcing and program production posts on the high-power station
staff."

Student Station Manager Mark Wilensky believes that going from FM to AM carrier-current would "be a tremendous step backwards. It
would be only slightly better than no station at all." He then pointed out that, with that change, the broadcasts
would be restricted to campus buildings, mainly dormitories. The First Class Licensed Engineer for WDAV, Donald K. Smith, feels that,
"We cannot faithfully reproduce the albums at the station with an AM carrier-current broadcast. The quality of an AM broadcast
is by nature quite inferior to FM because AM can only (See POWER, page 12)
