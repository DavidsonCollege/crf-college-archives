Residew Plays (And Talks) To You
By ANDY HACKETT

As I walked to the Kappa Alpha house to interview Davidson’s own Residew (evidently derived from their old moniker, Mountain
Dew), I could make out the notes of the “Barney Miller” theme song, certainly one of television’s funkier tunes, played
with the wit of an Abe Vigoda wisecrack. I thought, “Who are these guys... slapstick goofballs or neurotic geniuses?” It
turns out that they are neither—simply, the dudes in Residew are a group of musicians who are driving the magic
bus of classic rock and ask you to hop a ride.

Guitarist/vocalist Tom Edmunds, ’90, explained the group’s beginnings. “We got together last year, around Christmas. We played twice at SAE
and at Clemson. This year we came back and everybody was pretty serious about it. Two guys from Hit Attractions
(a Charlotte management agency) saw us and were impressed; now, they get us gigs all over, but they get a
cut.”

Brad Reddick, ’92, owner of the town’s only psychedelic pickup (as if there might be more than one), handles most
of the vocal and lead guitar work. He and Tom comprise the band’s harmonious dual-guitar sound, reminiscent of the legendary
Duane Allman/Dickey Betts duo in the Allman Brothers Band. “We play all classic rock covers,” Brad stated, “but we have
some original songs on the way.”

“We change up songs,” added Joe Binns, ’91, drummer and Davidsonian music columnist. “It’s great to play covers, but if
we played them exactly as they were written, you might as well stay home and listen to the radio.”

“Exactly,” affirmed Tom. “When you change it up, you get to put yourself into it, and we definitely have a
certain style.”

When asked about big influences, bassist Chip Petree, ’93, responded, “My biggest influence would be Geddy Lee from Rush and
Mike Mills from REM. I’m starting to be influenced by Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, but that doesn’t
show itself in the music we play.”

“I’m influenced by the Mississippi Delta bluesmen,” claimed keyboardist Will Percy, ’92, “like B.B. King.”

“I don’t really have one influence,” said Brad. “When you listen to any kind of music, it influences you in
some way.”

“Brad has been an influence for me,” said Tom. “He’s such a conglomerate of different styles that it helps my
own style.”

Concerning the Davidson music scene, Brad responded: “There is a plethora of individual musicians on campus who are really good,
but only a small number of bands. The scene has a lot of potential but it’s definitely not tapped into
yet. Within the core group of musicians, a lot of people play together.”

Beyond the campus, the band mentioned their upcoming shows scheduled at UVA, Swanee, and Charlotte Country Day.

“Hopefully, we’ll finish out the year, get better and try to play in clubs this summer,” said Tom.

As for any musical aspirations, the band members are skeptical. Tom stated that “nobody here says, ‘I want to be
a rock and roll star’. There is so much competition out there.”

“From what I gather,” offered Brad, “a musician’s life isn’t all that fun, as far as always being on the
road, getting little sleep, long hours... My goal is just to make music, and hopefully people will get something from
that. That’s my honest aspiration. Hopefully people will enjoy it and it will make them happy—that’s what is important.”

With an array of classic favorites from British supergroups to Texas blues/rock to Bay-area psychedelic, there is no doubt that
Residew will do just that. Look out for Residew bringin’ the house down.

Healthy Bites
Exercise & Diet During the Holidays

If you gained a few pounds during the holidays, you aren’t alone. Make a resolution to lose weight and startTODAY!
Avoid crash dieting as this often leads to diet failure and greater weight gain later. Very low-calorie diets and high
protein/low carbohydrate diets produce large water weight losses. Water weight is quickly regained when normal eating habits resume. Consumption of
less than 1200 calories daily can lead to muscle protein loss, lowering your calorie (energy) requirements further. Inadequate nutrient intake
and fatigue are other consequences. Generally, a weight loss plan should provide 10 calories per pound of present body weight
daily, i.e., 1300 calories for a 130-pound person. Expect to lose 1-2 pounds weekly. Include fruits, vegetables, grains, milk, and
meat/meat substitutes in 3 balanced meals. Special diet supplements are not necessary. Keep extra calories from fats, sugar, and alcohol
low. Regular aerobic exercise is essential to preserve and build muscle mass, the body’s calorie-burning tissue. Exercise will also increase
your daily energy expenditure, allowing for quicker weight loss. It is most important to develop eating and exercise habits to
keep the weight off. It can become increasingly difficult to lose weight every time you “diet.”

Fortune Continued from Page 7

graced with a visual representation. In the end, the audience does not know what happened in the von Bulow household
the night Sunny lapsed into a coma, and that is indeed the point. The audience feels the same frustration as
Dershowitz when Dershowitz stares intently into von Bulow’s eyes in search of the truth. Von Bulow, played by Irons, merely
gazes back and smokes his cigarette. On his face reads an invisible sign, “No Trespassing.” Despite a few overused concepts,
Reversal of Fortune is a well-developed drama confronting the issue of American social class structure and its relationship to man’s
right to receive a fair trial. Irons adds another feather in his cap as one of Hollywood's most unique and
talented actors while Close maintains a firm grasp on her amazing versatility. Reversal of Fortune is one of this year’s
sure things.
