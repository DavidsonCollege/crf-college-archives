An Exciting Evening

at times, is a concert hall, a lecture room, a news bureau, or a place of worship.

If you are interested to learn more about what electricity is doing, write for Reprint No. AR 391 containing a
complete set of these advertisements.

GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY

Here are four of the WGY Players (the world’s first radio dramatic company) at a thrilling climax that almost turns

Tune in, some evening, on one of their productions. You will be surprised to find how readily your imagination will
supply stage and setting.

BISHOP PENICK

(Continued from page 1)
“Tell us plainly,’ we mean beyond the range of doubt.”

Bishop Penick illustrated his meaning in several ways. He said that astrologers, botanists, and surgeons may make great discoveries in
their particular fields, yet the astrologer can’t find heaven, the botanist can't find what makes the flower grow, and the
surgeon can't find the soul. Spiritual things can be discerned spiritually and in no other way.

“The Bible has been and is being subjected to the fiercest examination. History stands today and points a long arm
to the manger of Bethlehem and says ‘there is the beginning of anything that can be called real civilization.’ History
tells of Jesus and rings with authority.”

Dr. Penick closed his message with the following appeal, “If you have doubts, seek to know the Father, not with
standards of reason, but through simple faith in Jesus Christ, for in Him alone all mysteries are now made plain.”

Piggy Martin led the singing, King Couper and McCravey gave a cornet duet. Jim Patton, Glenn Eddington, and Bob Mitchell
led in prayer. D. B. Wharton read the scriptures and Hayden Hollingsworth introduced the speaker.

Davidson has won four and lost three games to the “big three” of North Carolina, while Wake Forest won four
and lost five. State was able to win only two while losing three games in the “big five.”
