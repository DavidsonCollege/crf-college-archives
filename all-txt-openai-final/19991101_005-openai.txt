_ THE DAVIDSONIAN

Career Series talks kick off Monday night

The series’ four installments will be held on the first four Monday evenings in November.

The Annual International Career Series, a joint effort of the Dean Rusk Program and the Career Services Office, begins Monday, November 1, at 7:00 PM in the Homeroom of the Union. The guest speaker will be Wayne Cooper, president of Arcon Manufacturing in Charlotte.

This series of talks will take place on the first four Mondays of November, each at 7:00 p.m. in the Homeroom. Topics will include careers in international business, in the Foreign Service and in other governmental agencies, in international law, and in international and non-governmental organizations.

Cooper, the first speaker, is also the honorary Mexican consul for North Carolina. He has extensive experience in international business and is a member of the Dean Rusk Corporate Affiliates, a group of corporations that support the mission and activities of the Dean Rusk Program.

Our own Ambassador Kenneth L. Brown, head of Dean Rusk, will speak on November 8 on careers in the Foreign Service. Brown was a career foreign service officer and an ambassador three times: to Congo-Brazzaville, to the Ivory Coast, and, most recently, to Ghana.

The third speaker will be Wake Forest law professor Dr. Richard Schneider on November 15. He will speak on careers in international law.

Finally, Timothy Rothermel, Davidson Class of 1968, will address the topic of careers in international and non-governmental organizations on November 22nd. Rothermel is the Special Representative of the United Nations Development Program in its program of assistance to the Palestinian people.

Brown stressed that although these talks are not recruitment opportunities for students interested in international careers, they will offer great opportunities to assist students in planning their job searches.

“We want to try to tell students what it’s like to work in these careers,” Brown said, “how to get the job, and how to prepare for the job.”
