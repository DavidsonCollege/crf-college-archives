DAVIDSON'S NEWS FOLLOWER

Many around Davidson were
shocked to hear of the college’s
three-place drop from 7th to 10th
in the new U.S. News and World
Report’s rankings, but no one in
the Admissions office was sur-
prised. Admissions attributes the
fall to a recent strategic move to
target a less academic, but more
attractive, freshman class. The
overall high school GPA for the
class of 2009 was a 2.3, a signifi-
cant drop from 3.8 for the class of
2008. SAT scores also dropped to
970 from 1410 the previous year.

Assistant Director of
Admissions Nancy Hamilton said
that the new standards actually
resulted in a more balanced
incoming class: “The past few
years we have been bringing in stu-
dents with phenomenal SAT
scores, GPAs, and extracurricular
achievements, but they haven’t
really been much to look at. For
the class of 2009, we still reviewed
the academic scores, but without
ending up with a freshman class
that looks like it got hit with a bag
full of nickels.”

The Admissions office believes
that the change should not be
looked at as a ‘dumbing down’ of
standards, but rather an inclusion
of more aspects when looking at
prospective students. Where they
used to consider just test scores,
cumulative GPA, and essay, they
now also look at hair color, body
type, and a subjective score on a 1
to 10 scale that is referred to as
“The Hottie Index.”

Administrators always gave
some preferential treatment to
athletes and alumni; an argument
they have used to justify their cur-
rent favoring of attractive appli-
cants.

Proponents say the new stan-
dards will change Davidson for the
better. “Over the past couple of
years, everyone has been interest-
ed in the beautification of
Davidson College,” said Campus
Life coordinator Dusty Bradshaw.
“We have renovated Chambers,
Commons, numerous residential
dorms and social houses. What’s
wrong with renovating the student
body? The last thing we need to do
is sully the sparkling classrooms by
putting dumpy butts in all the
great new desks.”

Of course, not everyone is
pleased with the new student pool.
The new admission criteria has
already created a bit of an uproar
among the faculty. Professors of
lower level courses are complain-
ing that a number of their students
are showing up to class late,
unprepared, and quite frequently,
intoxicated. Attendance is at an all
time low, and there is a general
feeling that many students are
going to fail for missing more than
25 percent of their classes. “These
students are completely out of con-
trol,” said Dr. Henry Grable, who
teaches History 100W: Jesus,
Lions, and the Internet. “My most
recent Friday session was half-full,
and the students that were there
were either asleep or disorderly.
These kids look like they should be
on The Real World or Dog Eat
Dog.”

Arizona State of
the East”

Professors should expect more
of the same. Despite the controver-
sy, the Admissions office has said
that they are sticking with the new
standards for the class of 2010 and
beyond.

In response, the bookstore has
discontinued selling t-shirts with
the slogan “Davidson: The
Princeton of the South,” and has
instead ordered new shirts that
say, “Davidson: The Arizona State
of the East.”
