**Student arrested at illegal bonfire**

A combination of a pit, a pile of wood, a match, and beer led to an unmonitored, unlawful bonfire and the arrest of one student Saturday night.

Campus police report that two unidentified white males were seen just before lighting the fire, but they do not know exactly who was involved. They do know that whoever lit the fire did so without the supervision or permission of campus police, town police, the Union, or the fire department.

According to an unofficial source, two male independents who were at Kappa Sig were supposedly involved in lighting the bonfire and then taking off.

Lasting for only an hour between one and two a.m. (daylight savings time), the fire drew a large crowd of students from Kappa Sig and KA parties. The Union had planned for the bonfire, which required a permit by law, and a band for Friday night, but due to the rain, it was canceled.

The Physical Plant was going to clear away the materials left in the center of Patterson Court Monday morning. According to campus police officer T. G. Ramsey, no one thought anyone would light a bonfire without going through the mandatory procedures with the school and town.

When the campus police officers on duty realized the situation, they called the fire department and the Davidson town police to help clear out students and extinguish the flames.

In accordance with proper fire extinguishing procedure and student safety, the police asked students crowding around the pit to move away from the fire. Officer Ramsey says that before people cleared away, "we had students jumping across the fire; one just about fell in the fire."

According to police, one student, sophomore John Matthews, refused to move away from the fire.

**Davidson to host tourneys**

The NCAA men’s soccer final four has left Davidson, but high-profile tournaments have not.

The school will host the men’s and women’s soccer conference tournaments this weekend as well as the Deep South field hockey tournament. On November 17-19, Davidson will also host the conference volleyball tournament.

Game Management Director Lee Sargent says that Davidson was awarded the Southern Conference events based in part on the school’s past experience with handling big events.

"All those events are obtained through a bid process," he says. "The advantage that we have is that in certain sports, we have a good gauge on what our appeal is and an experienced infrastructure."

A volunteer paints a child’s face at the Halloween Carnival

**Morning after**

By Sarah Teachworth

The women of each Patterson Court eating house, the BSC, the Big Buddies program, and the Freshman Class came together to provide a free Halloween carnival and haunted house for the Davidson community last Tuesday.

Included in the festivities at Johnston Gym were a bean bag toss, face painting, pin the frog on the witch, and "Goo-Grasp," where children could reach into Jello and pull out a plastic prize.

A haunted house was set up in two adjoining rooms. A witch guided children through the dark rooms, where she claimed Mr. Johnston died. The children watched as a student pretended to be a mortician working on his body. They could also touch Mr. Johnston’s "eyeballs." Then the children were chased out by ghosts.

The project was conceived, planned, and put together in a short amount of time, yet the organizers did not face any major problems.

To avoid "rushing," eating houses are extremely limited in their interactions with first-year women. At the same time, upperclass women wish to get to know them. To alleviate this problem, the service chairs of Warner Hall, Liz and Jean Boehmler, conceived the idea of the Halloween carnival.

They approached Kurt Holmes and asked him if they could put together a service project involving both their eating house and the women of the freshman class. Holmes approved the idea, with the stipulation that every eating house be invited to participate.
