### Sailors found; Ollie North linked to drug ring; French pres. elections begin  
By MUADI MUKENGE  

#### Headlining the news, April 21-27  

**Across the Nation:**  
Three sailors who had been reported missing from last Sunday’s explosion aboard the submarine USS Bonefish were found dead Wednesday by Navy rescue teams. The accident occurred 160 miles east of Port Canaveral, Fla. Twenty-two sailors were injured, 19 of whom were discharged from a Navy hospital Tuesday. The exact cause of the explosion is still undetermined, but officials believe that the diesel/electric sub had a hydrogen gas buildup which ignited as batteries in the electric motors were being recharged. The boarding of the disabled submarine had been delayed to allow for the diffusion of toxic fumes. The USS Bonefish was conducting a routine training mission when the explosion occurred.

Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis now leads the Democratic presidential candidates in the total number of delegates won—1087.85—as a result of Tuesday’s Democratic primary in Pennsylvania. The contest rewarded Dukakis with 66 percent of the vote while Jackson had 29 percent. Jackson is in second place with 780.45 delegates. In the months’ contests to come, the candidate who receives a total of 2081 will be the party’s choice as presidential nominee. Primaries still to be conducted will take place in Ohio, the District of Columbia, California, New Jersey, and Indiana. As of now, there are 620.65 uncommitted delegate votes, which added to Gore’s 405.55 delegate votes will help either Dukakis or Jackson reach a major lead. Meanwhile, Vice-President George Bush has the 1139 delegate votes needed to receive the nomination from the Republican party.

The private diaries of Lt. Col. Oliver North will be examined as a result of a vote by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to subpoena those records. North was fired from the National Security Council in November 1986 when he became implicated in the Iran-contra affair. The diaries are believed to have information about an international drug smuggling operation which transported drugs on the return flights of the weapon deliveries to the Nicaraguan rebels. The diary—many sections of which are blemished—was kept from September 1984 to November 1986 and includes several references to the Drug Enforcement Agency as well as to CIA agents.

**Around the World:**  
Socialist President Francois Mitterrand will face Prime Minister Jacques Chirac in a runoff May 8 of the French national presidential elections. Chirac, a member of the Rally for Republic Party, needs the support of other parties on the Right to gain a majority over the 71-year-old Mitterrand. None of the candidates of the Right received a majority in Sunday’s first-round election. Chirac received 19.5 percent, former P.M. Raymond Barre received 16.5, Jean-Marie Le Pen had 14.4. Mitterrand won 34.1 percent of the popular vote.

Saudi Arabia terminated diplomatic relations with Iran Tuesday, citing “terrorism and subversion” as reasons for the move. The Saudi government is charging Iran with the killing of pilgrims headed for Mecca last year and attacks on the Saudi Embassy as well as on shipping activities on the Persian Gulf. The Saudi council of ministers has ordered Iranian diplomats to leave the country within a week. Saudi Arabia is an ally of Iraq, with which Iran has been at war for eight years.

### Charlotte Mayor Myrick speaks at Open Luncheon  
By LISA JACKSON  

Sue Myrick, who defeated popular opponent Harvey Gantt last fall to become Charlotte’s first female mayor, spoke at Davidson’s Open Luncheon in the 900 Room on Wednesday. She addressed several key city issues such as transportation, housing, and shelter for the homeless before answering questions from the audience. “We are becoming a city whether we like it or not,” said Myrick. “Now we just have to deal with it.” But if the issues just have to be “dealt with” as Myrick puts it, then all Charlotte’s problems should be solved by the time she leaves office. She has a lot of ideas, but it remains to be seen whether or not she can and will carry through.

The luncheon was opened by Andy Nilsson of the Davidson College Republicans who commented that the mayor is a “good Republican.” Myrick first addressed an issue familiar to everyone who has traveled in or around Charlotte—transportation. “We’re planning a bond referendum to assist with highway construction,” she explained. The referendum will basically accelerate the construction schedule from 10 to 5 years. Future changes in Charlotte’s road system will include: widening and extending many major arteries, creating more one-way streets, making left-hand turning easier, and adding a third lane for turning.

Finding a way to deal with the homeless is another of Myrick’s major concerns. “We have found a site for the housing shelter,” she announced. “I have only one opponent to the site; and fortunately, he’s a Republican.” Myrick visited San Diego recently and was impressed with the way they run their housing center. The homeless do not just stay without responsibility. They go through a program that supposedly rehabilitates 60% of them and gets them off the streets. Myrick hopes to bring the same type of operation to Charlotte. She emphasizes, “It’s not just going to be bed and board.”

Then the mayor turned to the audience’s questions. Asked if the city will give any more support to the Ramesses exhibit coming to the Mint Museum in the fall, Myrick asserted a definite NO. The museum has already received the city’s allotment. “If the city gives any more money, the museum will have to repay it,” she said.The question of whether a rail system is feasible in our lifetime brought nods of approval from the audience. Myrick says the idea has been proposed and she thinks the area is ideal. According to her, a rail system would be attractive to the white-collar community which chooses not to ride the present bus system. Ultimately, this would be a big boost for the transportation problem. Will Davidson be included in the rail system? “Yes,” claims Myrick. “We realize we have a large number of commuters in towns like Davidson, Concord, and Huntersville. And we know the transportation problem will not disappear if we don’t include the surrounding areas as well.” Myrick concedes that Southeast Charlotte is not one of those problems that can just be taken care of. She says that real estate agents have been pushing it as “the place to live” for many years. Now, however, the area is overflowing. Students are packing schools on this side of town while the other side has many spaces left unfilled. “And how can you justify building another school in Southeast Charlotte when you have some sitting nearly empty?” asks Myrick. It’s just not an easy problem because as she adds, “People are going to live where they want to.” Myrick wants to push the city to work more with the neighboring counties and other metropolitan areas in North Carolina instead of just being the “great state of Mecklenburg” as many have viewed Charlotte in the past. “Together we can move things,” she suggests. When asked what she did in her free time, Myrick winced. “What free time?” She says being mayor has become somewhat of a problem because she is technically working two jobs. She divides her time between her job and the mayor’s. Charlotte’s mayor should be commended for facing the future instead of just dealing with the present problems. The area is growing at record speed and national attention will be focused on how Charlotte handles this growth. “We have to work on the problem before it hits,” says Myrick. “That’s why we need to build this rail system so we’ll be ready for it, because it’s going to happen.”

Davidson ROTC excels at Ranger Challenge despite setbacks
By MARGARET CARROLL

On Saturday, April 23, Davidson took an ROTC team to Appalachian State University to participate in the spring ROTC Ranger Challenge weekend. Davidson's team of eight people and one alternate finished third in the competition. Events included a physical fitness test, a rope bridge competition, marksmanship, a grenade throw, weapons assembly, and a 10-kilometer road march. Team members were: junior and captain of the team John Black and freshmen Stuart Baker, Cecily Craighill, Mark Harris, Bob Hornsby, Rob Lim, Mike Peters, David Taylor, and Derrick Willard. They left at 4:30 am on Saturday and returned on Saturday night. The competition at Appalachian was a “head to head” competition, meaning that Appalachian invited the other schools to participate. The Ranger Challenge competition is fairly new and is considered “varsity ROTC.” Thus the Davidson team competed against schools like Wake Forest who have over 200 cadets in their program and who pick their eight best to compete. The Davidson team suffered the most setbacks in the road march, in which each person had to carry a 40-pound pack, and the team had to finish as a group. One person was injured during the march but kept running, and the team members divided his gear and shared the load. Then another person’s pack broke, and the team had to redistribute the gear and pull together once again. According to Black, the team gained a lot of experience from the Ranger Challenge competition and is “psyched” to go to the regional brigade competition next fall. The team’s time bettered Davidson’s last effort in the fall by 45 minutes and only finished nine minutes behind the winner.

Housing lottery completed
By TOBY TRUOG

According to Tom Jennings, Director of Residence Life, this year’s housing lottery went exactly as planned. The new senior apartments reduced the number of students who would have to find off-campus housing. Although some students are on the waiting list, these people will most likely be housed. There are 15 women and 12 men on the waiting list this year. This number is half the number of students who were wait-listed last year. There are people who participated in the lottery, but who are planning to find rooms off campus. “These wait-listed people will be accommodated. We expected this many people to be wait-listed,” says Tom Jennings. Twenty-three women and five men signed up for rooms available in the spring. Although more students than this are going abroad fall semester, not all of them are opting to be wait-listed. Mr. Jennings said, “We will be working with those students who sign up to get rooms in the spring in order to put them with compatible roommates.” An early lottery was held for the new apartments. The new senior apartments absorbed most of the people who lived in the perimeter houses. The distribution of males to females in the apartments is 60% to 40% respectively, with 21 men and 15 women. As was expected, the first dorm to fill after the apartments was Duke dorm. This was followed by Watts. Sentelle, Belk, Cannon, and Little dorms then filled and the rest of the students registered for “Sophomore Year Abroad” dorms Akers, Irwin, and Knox.
