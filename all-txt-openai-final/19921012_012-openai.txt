**Movie Review: Singles**
By Scott McLean

Finally, after a season of big-name features that turned out to be big-name bombs, a feature film with no major
stars manages to come in and breathe some life into the movie industry that seems to have gotten itself stuck
in a rut as of late. Writer/director Cameron Crowe’s “Singles,” the story of a group of Seattle twenty-somethings looking for
love in a big city, has arrived just in time to remind me that Hollywood is capable of releasing a
film that is funny, intelligent, and gives you enough gritty realism to make you think about your own place on
this big ole ball we call Earth while still entertaining you. Thank the Lord for small miracles.

As the movie opens, Linda (Kyra Sedgwick; nothing comes to mind right now that she was in recently, but you'll
recognize her from somewhere), an environmental task force worker, is excited about finally moving into her own place with its
own private parking. Although she is not looking for a relationship, she gets conned into a relationship only to get
her heart broken, causing her to swear off men for good. Zip over to Steve (Campbell Scott, that guy with
Julia Roberts in “Dying Young”) who works with the Department of Transportation and who finds himself floundering after just breaking
up with his longtime girlfriend. Then, we have Janet (Bridget Fonda) who is trying to figure out why her musician
boyfriend Cliff (Matt Dillon) isn’t as crazy about her as she is about him.

It is really hard to give a summary here, but suffice it to say that it is all about the
trials and tribulations of a bunch of young, ripe, single folks in their prime on the lookout for love in
a big evil city with danger and heartbreak lurking ‘round every corner. The film tells the story of how they
look after each other and draw strength and inspiration from one another - kind of like a “St. Elmo’s Fire”
meets the show that was on MTV about all those people who lived in that apartment together, “The Real World,”
except different.

Anyway, what sets this flick apart from others like it is the depth of talent that it possesses. Sedgwick, Scott,
Fonda, and Dillon are in primo form here, along with two other main actors whose names I don’t remember, but
they are still good too. Kudos to y’all! Also give a pat on the back to Cameron Crowe, who brought
his own story of the Seattle singles scene to the screen without getting too bogged down in topicality - this
could be a universal story going on in any other big city in the country besides Seattle. At some points,
I found myself wondering whether the film was too trendy even for itself with its grunge rock soundtrack and the
“Cooler than thou” attitude of the characters, but considering that the movie has been finished for over a year and
a half before the “Seattle sound” broke out from the underground, I am willing to forgive Crowe. What I was
concerned about was why Warner Brothers waited so long before releasing the film - but I guess it doesn’t really
matter because with the pack of losers (for the most part) out right now, it makes me appreciate this gem
all the more.

**Brooks Continued from page 11**

It is the five remaining songs on this 37-plus minute project that provide the real meat of the album (apart
from “We Shall...”). The two-minute, rollicking two-stepper “Mr. Right (or Mr. Right Now)” provides a woman with her choice of
a one-night stand or a beau, and provides the listener with a dynamite swing that has to produce a grin.
“Every Now and Then,” with an accompaniment that conjures up images of Brooks’ “The River,”is one of the album’s strongest
and most moving tunes; a song about remembering an old love, it could make a good single. “Learning to Live
Again,” co-written by country’s top songwriter Don Schlitz, is a wonderfully bittersweet and somewhat humorous song about trying to get
back on one’s feet after a break-up; and “That Summer” provides a new twist as far as subjects go. The
song, which tells the story of a farmhand who becomes the lover of his boss, a widower, is a truly
great moment on the album (among many). It has a steady beat paced by a sole acoustic guitar, and should
make a great single, reminiscent of the songs by great storytellers from Billy Joel to Bruce Springsteen. The second cut
on the album wins my immediate nod as personal favorite, but I’m a sucker for the emotional ones. As if
the message and production of “Somewhere Other Than the Night” are not strong enough to carry the song, Garth Brooks
finds a vocal dynamic and a beauty he has never before produced. The open-throated style is not one he has
mastered - it is not his; but his efforts on this song are worth his weight in gold. He records
a triumph, and one of his very finest songs ever.

The Chase is entertaining and engaging; but beware, for it is not entirely like the Garth Brooks you have heard
before. It is different, but it is unquestionably Garth. Purists will perhaps call into question the song choices; the style
is different - not as “country.” True, it does lack (noticeably) a beltbuster (the type of song of which he
is truly the master) like “Friends in Low Places,” “Rodeo,” or “Shameless”; but it manages to extend itself in so
many other directions that such a song had no place on this album. Yes, the album is a departure; but,
in their own ways, so were the last two. Garth Brooks has earned the right to explore, to challenge himself
and us with new subjects and new sounds. But Garth still possesses the voice of country, and it is that
voice that brings it all together. He makes any song country, and he charges every song he sings with life.
With each album, Garth’s songs are less radio-oriented and more directed toward creativity and integrity. And, in that light, he
has scored his greatest victory. Give the album some time; give it several listenings. This may not be your favorite;
it isn’t mine. I, too, am hoping that he will return to his country roots. But Garth has already shown
us the performer and the country super-superstar. The Chase is his effort to show us - in every sense of
the word - the artist. Garth Brooks is still Garth Brooks; if you don’t believe me, go see him in
concert (if you can get tickets). And if The Chase leaves you yearning for more... he’ll be back... and he’ll
be back on top (although we’ll see what effect Taylor has on his style and song choice). The reason no
one can seem to take his place? No one can match his vitality, his energy, his creativity, his talent, and
his passion. There is only one king of country; accept no substitutes.
