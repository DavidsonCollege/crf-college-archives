**Campus Comment - Duke Uprising Fields Support**

The following persons were asked this question: “What do you think about the recent situation at Duke University?”

**James Parks, Sophomore:**
“For the issues involved, it was the only way possible to achieve the desired goals. Quite often it is difficult to get legitimate demands—which these at Duke were—met through regular channels, because of administrative attitudes toward students.”

**Leslie Brown, Senior:**
“The problem at Duke is found on any of the so-called ‘integrated’ campuses. Black students on such campuses form a powerless minority, just as blacks in the overall American society. The activities of the black students at Duke are an attempt to form a base of power to bring about meaningful changes in the academic environment. The tactics used are undoubtedly the only ones available to a ‘powerless’ minority.”

**Allen Lundy, Freshman:**
“Students, as defined, don’t have all the answers, and as such, it’s stupid and arrogant for them to try to control a university. The university was broken down, and as such, it was unfair to these students as well as to the institution. Granted a problem exists, but there is a better way.”

**The Rev. Scott Woodmansee, College Chaplain:**
“One of the issues is an identity problem for blacks. In some cases, they feel they can’t compete, which increases inferiority complexes that need to be overcome. I realize that I can’t talk with authority on this issue because I’m not black, but there may be some validity in the above.”

**Area Colleges Form Co-op Plan**

Davidson College has joined eight other area colleges and universities in an association designed to facilitate movement by students and faculty among the member schools. Students will be able to take courses at other schools in the group, which has been named the Charlotte Area Educational Consortium, for degree credit at their own colleges. Also, professors will be able to teach courses at other schools without losing or changing their status at their own schools. Two other advantages are that library resources will be pooled and coordinated programs may be set up, such as a possible Afro-American Studies program at Johnson C. Smith University, a member of the group. Dr. W. Hugh McEniry, vice chancellor for academic affairs at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, has been named chairman of the consortium’s central committee. The charter members of the association are Barber Scotia College, Belmont Abbey, Central Piedmont Community College, Davidson, Gaston College, JCSU, Queens College, Sacred Heart College, and UNCC.

**OPEN HOUSE**

These houses will be open Sunday night at 8:
- J. N. Burnett 439-A N. Main
- Francis Ghigo 637 Lorimer
- C. E. Ratliff Jr. 301 Pinecrest
- W. P. Minter Churchill

**‘Right You Are’ Discrepancies Ruin Mood**

**A REVIEW By DICK ANDERSON Staff Writer**

What is truth? That is the question proposed by Pirandello’s play “Right You Are,” now being presented by the Davidson Drama Department. Throughout the play Laudini, played with remarkable skepticism by senior Dick Poole, tries to tell the rest of the cast that truth is strictly relative, but none will listen. Instead, they seek feverishly to decide who is mad, the secretary Ponza who keeps his wife locked in a tenement, or his mother-in-law, who believes her dead daughter to be alive but humors the secretary’s belief that his present wife is actually a second wife, whom he married after the mother-in-law’s daughter was killed. Ponza is played with force and imbalance by junior Tom Way, while Constance Welsh, wife of Associate Professor of Music Wilmer H. Welsh, does a competent, polished job as the mother-in-law, Signora Frola. She should, as she is the lone professional in the cast.

As Commendatore Agazzi, who leads the search for an absolute truth, senior Joe Gardner is the only student in a major role who is able to effectively overcome the discrepancy between his age and the age of the character he plays. Sophomore Cullum Rogers, for instance, just does not come across as the husband of Signora Sirelli, played by Ellen Winkler, wife of associate professor Julius Winkler. Mrs. Winkler does well as a domineering busybody, but her performance is overshadowed by that of Mary Rose Davis, who is as bitingly apropos as a Peter Arno cartoon in her role as another local gossip, Signora Cini. The type-casting throughout the cast for minor characters is well done with only a few slight exceptions. Senior Ken Fuller as an otiose commissioner, freshman Jack Scott as an aged, almost crippled butler, and Katie MacLean as the ingenue Dina are all effective and funny. Sophomore Al McGraw tries hard as the prefect who finally unravels the mystery, but he just does not look as old as he ought and he has not learned to walk naturally with a cane.

Generally, though, the cast performs very well. The sets are competently carpentered and designed, and the costuming, by Mrs. Rupert Barber, wife of the director, emphasizes the ambiguity of the play in that nearly all the clothing is black, gray, or white. Particularly Ponza, his wife, and Signora Frola are dressed in keeping with their roles in a funeral black.

Why then does the play not come off? Part of the problem is that the play itself is difficult and slow in spots. Another problem is that this review had to be written from a dress rehearsal to meet the deadline, and the cast did not have the stimulation of a large audience. Also, in the crucial line at the end of the play, Ellen Johnston as Signora Ponza, the wife, does not come through. If she is supposed to be ethereal, she is not ethereal enough; if the line is meant to be spoken plainly, she says it too much like a ghost. In other words, she tries both and succeeds in neither. Overall, the cast does a good job, but these annoying discrepancies creep in to ruin the mood too often.

**Miscellany Late In Distribution**

The Miscellany is to be ready for delivery this weekend, but the exact date it will be placed on sale is not certain yet, according to George House, the magazine's editor. The magazine would be the first issue this year. House attributed the delay to the printing company not being able to work on the book until recently. The coming issue will contain four sections, House said, covering art, fiction, non-fiction, and poetry. A substantial amount of the magazine's content has come from non-Davidson sources as far away as California and Indiana, he said.

Earlier in the year, The Miscellany and the student Senate had disagreed over a proposed increase in The Miscellany budget to allow The Miscellany to publish larger and more frequent editions. Last year's spring issue under House's editorship won praise from The New York Times.

**State Holds In Student Drug Case**

**By PAUL ROWLAND Associate Editor**

The two Davidson juniors facing drug charges in Prince William County, Va. are off the hook, but not necessarily permanently. A motion of “nolle prosequi” was entered at the hearing last Friday by the Commonwealth attorney. The term means that the case has not been dropped and could be brought back into court, according to the court's records personnel. Such a motion is often made, according to the legal aide, when the prosecuting attorney feels that he has insufficient evidence to proceed with a trial. One of the students had been arrested on charges of possessing drugs, possessing marijuana, and a traffic charge of not having car registration in his possession. The other student was arrested on charges of possessing marijuana and failure to carry proper identification.

**Forum Planned At Wake Forest**

Davidson has been invited to send ten delegates to a Wake Forest University symposium March 20-22, featuring several nationally prominent speakers including Sen. Edmund Muskie (D-Maine). Muskie will keynote the “Challenge ‘69” convention.Writer: “The constitution gives us the responsibility of enacting legislation for the betterment of the student body and the college as a whole. This is a good definition of the role the Senate should play in Davidson life.” This was the initial response of Senator Harry Goldman to questioning.

Constitutional Crisis (Continued From Page 1)

“Should we lose on that point alone,” said Rowland, “the legality of the convention itself can be brought into question. I have evidence on subpoena and witnesses to show that some people who registered for the delegate’s election weren’t placed on the ballot, while others who hadn’t registered were included.”

The second restraining order prevents the seating of three senators appointed by SGA President Peter Hobbie to fill vacancies. The vacancies resulted from the resignation of the senators from Cannon, Watts, and Richardson to run for senator at-large. Riner, who will handle this case himself before the Court of Appeals, said that his argument was based on Article II, Section 1 of the constitution, which provides for the election of all senators “by and from the residence halls.” He also noted that the opposition case would probably be based on Article II, Section 2(b), which gives the Senate the power to fill vacancies.

“The issue here is whether the SGA president is going to have the power to appoint a bloc of senators every year,” said Riner. “It is nearly certain that dorm Senators will resign each year to run at-large. If the present situation is continued, this will mean that the SGA president will have the right to appoint several senators each year. We feel that the new Senators should be elected from the districts where the vacancies occurred. This will give students better representation in the Senate and remove the possibility of a ‘rubber stamp’ bloc of Senators who owe their seats to the president,” Riner said.

Allison (Continued From Page 1)

Allison continued, “but the faculty has not yet approved the court.” Allison said that there were two reasons why the court's actions have been out of step with the constitution: lack of communication with the faculty and a great many changes which have occurred recently. The writ which prompted Kaylor’s letter also included limitations on room searches by administration personnel and restricted college jurisdiction to students’ on-campus activities. As acting chairman of the court, Allison is automatically president of the convention.

Riner and Rowland agreed that the Senate issue was important in that it was to prevent circumvention of the Constitution by SGA officers. Appeals Court Chairman Dick Allison said that the issue will be brought to court at the request of the student responsible for the orders, or when another student can show that the SGA is crippled by the orders. In regard to the order restricting the SEC, Allison, who is also chairman of the Constitutional Convention, said, “We took the action we did when we did because we felt they were practical and necessary. Since several people object to our action, I'm certainly willing to have it settled by the court.” When asked if he thought Riner would win his case on the amendments issue, Allison answered, “I'd bet on it.”

Goldman went into more detail about this question, saying, “This definition leaves the Senate a lot of leeway for action. There are issues of all sorts which constantly confront us, each demanding a different type of action. It’s up to the Senate to do what it deems wise in dealing with each one.” He went on to point out other facets of the Senate's duty. “In many instances, the Senate performs a valuable service by merely recognizing the position of various interest groups on the campus. The people backing the ‘Five-year Plan’ were heard by us, as were those coordinating Coeducation Week.”

In assessing his career in the Senate, Goldman observed that his personal role had grown with time. “I was elected last fall as senator from Richardson Dorm, and was elected senator-at-large in the most recent election. As time has gone by, I’ve gotten more and more involved, so that I’m now in a position to be as effective as possible.”

In assessing the specific issues confronting the Senate, Goldman emphasized the fact that most issues are decided by the views of individual senators. “Many issues boil down to a value judgment which must be made by each senator,” he said. “The vote on ROTC is an example. In the judgment of some, ROTC had to be limited. I personally feel that it has a place here and differences of opinion like this are what make the Senate interesting and valuable.”

“I think there will be further consideration of ROTC,” he said, considering the future, “and probably some action alternatives to the present chapel set-up.”

“In my opinion, the Senate is doing a good job,” Goldman continued, “If anyone thinks we should do more, he should let us know. A few students have discussed campus issues with other senators and me, but many more should have done so. The only way we can possibly do our best work is for students to give us their complaints and criticisms.”

The theme of which is ‘The Urban Crisis — The Students’ Response.’ Other speakers who have accepted invitations include Harvey Cox, author of ‘The Secular City’; Saul Alinsky, director of the Industrial Areas Foundation of Chicago and the newly formed Midas Foundation; Robert Wood, former undersecretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development; and Herbert Kramer, former aide to Shriver and presently a consultant to the Office of Economic Opportunity. The symposium will consider the student's role as a citizen and voter, as a volunteer and as a part of the university's participation in community problems. Delegates from 200 Eastern schools have been invited. Davidson students who are interested in attending the symposium should contact the chaplain's office.

ACU-I Selects Smith

C. Shaw Smith, director of the College Union, has been named chairman of the Committee on Relations with Artists’ Representatives of the Association of College Unions-International (ACU-I). The appointment was made by the association's president, Edwin O. Siggelkow, director of the Coffman Memorial Union at the University of Minnesota. ACU-I is a professional organization of 800 college unions. Founded in 1914, the body now claims affiliates in countries all over the world.
