#### The New Sounds of Spain & On the

By Curtis MANN
Staff Writer

Picture yourself retreating from a Friday night of club hopping. The ecstasy has worn off, and you step into a velvety dive for a late-night martini. There’s a band playing; four dapper fellows on a dimly lit blue-green stage. Everyone’s smoking, except for the band. They’re helping you come down with moody, bluesy jazz tunes that creep and crawl into your head at a snail’s pace. The band is Spain, and their debut *The Blue Moods of Spain* evokes images of descending angels, lost loves, loneliness, and general malaise. This is not to say that this album is some sort of dirge, however. There are plenty of sweet moments and variations of their dark moodiness which will maintain your will to live, but expect to listen to Spain between two and five in the morning, or in the bleaker moments in your life. 

Spain is fronted by Josh Haden, a smooth singing bassist whose father was a legendary jazz man, and is rounded out by drummer Evan Hartzell, guitarist Merlo Podlewski, and guitarist/organist Ken Boudakian. There is some trumpet on “Ray Of Light” and cello and violin to go with “World Of Blue,” but other than that, no other instruments are used on this minimalist album. The final cut, “Spiritual,” is a religious confessional asking Jesus for some help in what seems to be a dreary existence. This might just do the trick as you leave the bar feeling purged and cleansed, calmed and ready to do it all again: Saturday night.

Alas, there is yet another band with Super (Supergrass, Superchunk, Superstar, and Superfriendz to name but a few) in their name, and get this, they are from Seattle of all places! But do not write them off just yet. Super Deluxe is pretty...er...super. On their ten-song debut *Famous*, Super Deluxe goes full throttle with some great power pop, saluting such bands as the Gigolo Aunts, or to a lesser extent, their Seattle chums The Posies along the way. What stands out about this album is that, aside from a brief faux-symphonic intro to the album and about 20 seconds of campy carnival organ at the conclusion, there is no nonsense or ridiculousness to be heard. Thank heavens there’s not a damned secret track at the end or some crappy outtake to mar this infectious effort. 

Throughout, Super Deluxe keep the hooks coming like locusts in a cornfield and create an energetic and electric thrill ride that is over with before you even realize it. Pop sensibilities abound, but it’s not so jangly that *Famous* ever becomes a saccharine record. Their beaming harmonies override some lyrics which veer dangerously close to triteness (“Smile,” “Flustered”), but Super Deluxe offer up a tantalizing half hour of guitar-driven tunes which soar beyond many contemporaries.
