### SPRUNT FIELD SCENE OF MUCH EXCITEMENT

Probably not since the days when Adam was a bachelor has the Sprunt Athletic Field been the scene of such
active activities as was the case last Thursday afternoon. Around the diamond were scattered the coming Hans Wagners and the
embryo Ty Cobbs, while dashing up and down the track were the fleet-footed sons of Mercury. Just as A. F.
Fricker, the champion long-distance man of seventeen counties, was finishing his twenty-first lap, his whirlwind passage frightened from its lair
a member of the species *Lepus sylvaticus*, commonly known as cotton-tail or graveyard rabbit. The track team immediately started after
it in full force, closely pursuing it around the track, and were joined by all the chasers of the elusive
pill.

“Cop” Johnson, seeing this reminder of his home in the wilds of Clayton, gave vent to one of his famous
rabbit hound yodels and struck out after the hare. This so frightened the varmint that it overlooked the means of
exit offered by the gate and led the whole swarm at a hot gait around the cinder path. Here it
courted danger in the shape of “Pee Wee” Ratchford, who showed that he was reared “far from the madding crowd”
by giving a fine exhibition of how bunnies are pursued down in the Palmetto State. Although closely pressed, the rabbit
kept its wits about him, and while hopelessly outnumbered, was apparently more than a match for the crowd as far
as “headwork” was concerned, for after much doubling and dodging he slipped through them and under the fence, lighting a
raz for the negro planting reservation to the north of the field.

### EXCELLENT WAR HISTORIES RECEIVED BY LIBRARY

“The Current History of the European War” is the latest and one of the most valuable additions to the library.
It is a collection of the best articles on the causes, operations, and results of the war, by the best
thinkers of the day. The New York Times has ably assembled these volumes, each covering three months of war activities.
Every volume has a complete alphabetical index of articles, writers, illustrations, maps, and diagrams. In addition, there are numerous full
plate illustrations from the best official war photographers and several characteristic sketches of the great men in world affairs.

The Library also received this week a more condensed history of the world war, by Frank H. Simonds. Three of
the five volumes of this history are in the Library now and the final two volumes are to be added
when released by the publishers.

### DIAMOND DUST

Spann’s single in the ninth prevented the Wildcats from having a hitless day.

For information as to how to pull a double play “unassisted,” see Ratchford.

Better look out for Currie and Clark. They are extremely wild at times. Never mind this, though, for it is
only temporary. They are going to make a “nifty” pair of college twirlers.

Johnny Richards started one Saturday that looked good for two bases, but a fine stop by the Phillies’ second-sacker robbed
him of it.

Since the game with the Phillies, all Davidson players are anxiously waiting to see if Jack Coombs will offer them
a contract.

While “Dug” McArn was at the bat, a feminine voice in the grandstand was heard to say: “Cut out the
Hoola, Hoola, kid, and swat the pill.”

“Cop” Johnson had quite...a puzzle on his chest in the form of a breast protector. This probably encouraged him in
his peg to center field. A thing almost too good to be true nearly happened in the eighth inning when
the umpire was almost knocked out of the box. “Crabby” Cravath, judging from his flow of language when soaked in
the ribs by one of Currie’s fast shoots, has been rightly dubbed.
