Perimeter Attack Blasts Blue Hose
By DON SEWELL
Assistant Sports Editor

Coach Homer Smith singled out Presbyterian's poor “perimeter defensive coverage” as the major reason for the Wildcats’ 33-0 success against
the Blue Hose here last Saturday.

"We gained 480 yards in the game,” Smith said. “We had a good offensive day. Hank Strickland, Gary Hemric, and
Terry Esterkamp did such a good job of rushing and containing the PC quarterback that the secondary was able to
intercept five passes,” Smith said. “They (PC) played a good game except for their perimeter defensive coverages. Our weapons were
aimed at these zones and that is how we beat them."

Wide runs and passes made the difference, Smith added, as the ‘Cats hammered at the flanks while containing the PC
offense. All the ‘Cat touchdowns came on passes. Halfback Billy Taylor, who played quarterback in high school, hit sophomore end
George Hannen for two TDs and senior Pete Glidewell for another. Quarterback Jimmy Poole tossed two six-pointers, both to Glidewell,
to round out the TDs. A safety added three points to the ‘Cat effort.

Smith reserved his greatest praise for the defense, which had been a weak point in the team. “Saturday's game was
a day when the interior linemen get first credit for the win," Smith said. The front four—Ed Ciplids, seemed in
containing the PC quarterback that the secondary was able to intercept five passes, Smith said. The defense had been allowing
an average of 24 points per game, but against Presbyterian, it held the Blue Hose scoreless and blocked two field
goals. The longest single gain PC could enjoy on the ground was a 9-yard run early in the first half.

Smith also praised the offensive line: Thompson, Walt Greens, Sandy Brenneman, Buddy Mewsen, and Lowell Bryan—for their efforts, noting that
the Presbyterian defense did not throw Poole for a single loss.

The dark spot for Davidson in an otherwise cheerful game came in the first half when fullback Kerry Keith, who
leads the ‘Cat backfield in rushing yardage, received a knee injury. Doctors were not sure how the injury will affect
his play.

The win leaves Davidson at 2-3 for the season.

“Was a good offensive day.”

After a strong 3-1 season start, the Wildcat soccer team received its first setbacks in last week's play, in a
2-2 double overtime tie with St. Andrews and a 4-2 loss to Appalachian.

“St. Andrews is by far the best team we have played this year,” Coach Farry Foaloman said. “The competition showed
both teams at their best. St. Andrews had been worth it.”

Kappa Sigs Grab Intramural Lead
The Kappa Sigs emerged as king in the IMAC this week, having won five games against one loss. The Sigs'
only loss came earlier in the season at the hands of the second-ranked Phi Gams. Meanwhile, the Gams hold a
5-2 record for the season and second place in the standings. The KAs and Phi Delts share 6-2 season totals
for third place honors. The KRAs have become a new threat in the IMAC bouts, having an experienced, fast team.
The ATOs hold fourth place.

Harriers Tie Pembroke, Nix Campbell, St. Andrews
Davidson's harriers tied a tough Pembroke team yesterday and scored wins over two others in a meet held at St.
Andrews College in Laurinburg. The ‘Cat cross-countrymen matched Pembroke's 32 points, while beating out runners from St. Andrews and Campbell
College. Carl Newhbay of Pembroke paced the runners, finishing well ahead of Davidson's John Puckett, who finished first for the
‘Cats.

“Newhbay is a real fine runner,” Puckett said. “I ran against him in high school. He had a cross-country scholarship
to Miami but transferred after they discontinued cross-country.” Jim McLaughlin finished sixth in the race and second for Davidson. Puckett
said the ‘Cats were hampered by their unfamiliarity with the course. “We had to finish the last 40 yards on
a grass-tex track,” he said. “When I got on the track I was in about fourth place. That's when I
started getting scared.” Although the ‘Cats failed to grab many of the top six or seven positions, they did seal
up about four or five spots in a row behind the number seven runner.

John Kilgo Quits Sports PR Post
John Kilgo has resigned as Davidson sports information director to become news director of WAYS Radio in Charlotte, it was
announced this week. Kilgo, who became sports information director when the position was created last year, said he is leaving
because his present job “doesn't give me any satisfaction or sense of accomplishment.”

“A man has got to do something that he thinks is useful and worthwhile,” Kilgo said. “I didn't get any
sense of being worthwhile here.” Kilgo said he will remain on the job through football season and longer if the
college cannot find a suitable replacement. As news director of WAYS, Kilgo will be managing the station’s news gathering staff
and will present an hourly commentary called “Kilgo’s Comments,” he said. A former staff member of the Charlotte News, Kilgo
wrote a daily column and covered political events for the newspaper.

The harriers' next meet is Wednesday, when Coach Heath Whittle’s runners travel to Greenville for a meet against East Carolina
and Virginia Military Institute. Most observers believe East Carolina may win the conference title this season.

NEW — FIND SCHOLARSHIPS BY COMPUTER
Last year $30 million in college scholarships went unclaimed because no qualified persons applied ... because no qualified persons knew
of them. Now engineers and educators have programmed a high-speed computer with 700,000 items of scholastic aid, worth over a
million, to permit students to easily and quickly locate scholarships for which they qualify. The student fills out a detailed,Confidentist
questionnaire and returns it to ECS, with a one-time computer-processing fee of $15. In seconds, the computer compares his qualifications
against requirements of grants set up by foundations, business, civic, fraternal, religious, and government organizations, and prints a personalized report
to the student telling him where and when to apply for grants for which he qualifies. Thousands of these do
not depend on scholastic standing or financial need, some are an | FREE AND SIMPLE QUESTIONNAIRE | OAICTN ARSENOA I
