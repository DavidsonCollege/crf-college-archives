Survey charts changes in the Class of 2001 while at Davidson

So what do you want to be when you grow up? Each year, hundreds of first-year students at Davidson respond
to that and many similar questions as part of the CSS CIRP survey. At the same time, a group of
seniors, separated from their freshmen counterparts by four years of hard work, late nights, wild parties, and probing questions, answer
the same battery of questions. The results can be surprising.

Director of Planning and Institutional Research Linda LeFauve commented on the numbers for Davidson’s Class of 2000. “What we get
back is a comparison [of the survey results] not in particular, but as an aggregate.” This national survey, based at
UCLA and used by colleges and universities all over the United States, measures changes in students’ attitudes and perceptions over
the course of their stay at a particular institution.

One important section deals with students’ self-image. “The survey asks you to rate yourself relative to your peers in a
whole range of academic and social variables,” explained Ms. LeFauve. For instance, respondents indicated whether they felt they were above
average “as compared with the average person of his/her age” in such areas as general academic ability, creativity, leadership ability,
and both intellectual and social self-confidence. The results list student responses both as entering freshmen and as graduating seniors and
compare them to averages for similar institutions.

Another area of the survey assesses goals and expectations. Students are asked to predict what their academic major will be,
what they expect to do immediately after graduating, and what career they eventually hope to pursue. In addition, some questions
call for estimates of how students will spend their time in college. “These questions ask what you expect your involvement
to be [while in college], what kinds of organizations you will participate in, and how satisfied you expect to be,”
LeFauve remarked.

Finally, another group of questions measures political views. Students can respond to a series of suggested policies, such as “Abortion
should be legal,” or, “The death penalty should be abolished,” indicating whether or not they agree with the statements. The
results come in the form of percentages.

Chances are very good that events actually occurring in college went differently than expected. One question asks students to rate
themselves on a political continuum extending from “far left” to “far right.” As one might expect, students’ views can change
considerably over the course of four years. In particular, “The self-ratings change because your normative group changes,” noted LeFauve. In
other words, as students move from one peer group in high school to another in college, their self-perceptions and political
views can shift.

Survey Results:
- Be satisfied with college: 76.9% (freshmen) vs. 87.2% (seniors)
- Change career choice: 26.7% (freshmen) vs. 57.9% (seniors)
- Change major field: 20.9% (freshmen) vs. 62.6% (seniors)
- Fail one or more courses: 0.0% (freshmen) vs. 7.6% (seniors)
- Join fraternity/sorority: 33.7% (freshmen) vs. 53.6% (seniors)

They are exposed to new and different fields of study, students discover interests in areas they never even knew existed.
Another in college, their basis of comparison changes. Students’ academic and career goals can also differ sharply after four years
in college. The main appeal of the survey for administrators is its widespread use among other colleges and universities. “Since
most things go the way we want them to, we spend a lot of time comparing ourselves to our peer
institutions,” said LeFauve.

Significant,” roughly 20 percent of first-year students do not anticipate changing their academic major or their career goal. In fact,
over 60 percent do change their plans at some point in college. According to LeFauve, most of the changes are
actually fairly predictable. As stated, students’ perceptions of themselves change as their peer group changes. Likewise, as
