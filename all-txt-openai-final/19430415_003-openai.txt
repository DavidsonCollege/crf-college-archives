AT YLAUSE By BOBBY PHILLIPS Wildcat Sports Thursday, April 15, 1943 CINDERMEN AT COLUMBIA THE DAVIDSONIAN BASEBALL

Weakened by the F. R. C. and various draft boards and suffering from a chronic shortage of pitchers, Davidson’s 1943
baseball nine has, of late, not been faring too well. In four games to date, the green ‘Cats have dropped
as many encounters. The one bright spot of these four losses was a brief period of three and a half
innings in the first game with Clemson when the Cats held a momentary 8-0 behind the tight pitching of lefty
Paul Neisler and hits by Phillips, Loughbridge, Maloney and others.

Lacy Leads Individual Scoring 3 inches. The ‘Cats’ infield, composed of two Seniors, a Sophomore, and a Freshman, worked with
surprising smoothness, but the outfield play has been erratic and spotty. Neisler is the only seasoned mound performer, while Jim
Lowry, Dick O’Hair, and Tommy Peters are hurling as varsity men for the first time. Incidentally, Peters, who regularly patrols
center field, will bear watching in his next hill assignment if and when he is needed. His relief job in
the second Clemson game was termed a “flop” by one of the State newspapers and the fair-haired one is determined
to make this erstwhile journal eat its words before the season’s end—he probably will.

TRACK

On the brighter side, the undefeated track team has two wins under its belt, having tromped Catawba and V. P.
I. Outstanding performers of the former meet were Wall and Ianacelli. Wall put up the most impressive display of distance
running seen in these parts since 1941. Against Catawba, Wall, not content with taking the 880 and the mile runs
in a breeze, shortly afterward entered the grueling two-mile heat and after trailing Davidson’s Bob Grimsley for seven laps, sprinted
the final lap in record time to lead the field by fifty yards as he broke the tape. Wall’s teammate,
Ianacelli, besides copping the broad jump with a leap of 21 feet and 2 inches, took the javelin toss also,
hurling the spear a respectable distance of 159 feet.

Bill Smith has developed into a consistent dash man for the ‘Cats. Finishing behind the Lacy Brothers in the 100-yard
dash in both meets to give Davidson a clean sweep in the century. Bill Lacy has decided not to enter
this dash against South Carolina Saturday since brother Ben and S. C.’s Riley are sure bets for the first two
slots and Smith is good for a close third, thus allowing the younger Lacy to conserve his energy for the
high jump and the hurdles.
