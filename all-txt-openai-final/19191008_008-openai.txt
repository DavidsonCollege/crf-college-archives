NEVER.

Old Master—I understand that he painted cobwebs on the ceiling so perfectly that the housemaid wore herself out trying to
sweep them down.
New Master—There may have been such an artist, but there never was such a housemaid.—Pittsburg Chronicle Telegraph.

Sophs and Juniors Do Battle with King Cotton Well—Seniors This Week

'Twas on Tuesday, the 30th of September, 1919, that the sophomore class of Davidson College sallied forth in the early
hours of the morning to do battle with Old King Cotton. They arrived on the scene of conflict early and
were soon regaled in the habiliments of war. At once they began to vie with each other who should be
in the lead when the battle would finally be declared won. And oh! how the white fleecy staple did fly!
Wagons were on the scene of conflict and were continually bearing off that which had been annihilated. The colonel was
here and there and everywhere, encouraging, exhorting and persuading to keep the good work going. Dinner hour was celebrated in
high glee, the boys having it in picnic style. Then to the afternoon grind. Oh! how those backs did ache
and those knees wobble. Many were the recourses to the elixir of life contained in the canteens, and the rests
under the trees became more and more frequent. But finally after ages of struggling 5:30 came and the Soph. cotton
picking day passed into history. But the reporter feels honor bound to mention two or three things the Sophs. did
which met the approval and congratulations of the whole student body. G. N. Neel, of this class, picked two hundred
pounds, the highest record yet, and the whole Soph. class averaged seventy-four pounds per man. The Juniors picked the following
Thursday. They went with jest and laughter, but alas, like all their predecessors, they returned grouchy, sore and tired. One
squad went out and returned with signal honors, its men having a round average of ninety-one pounds per man, while
they didn’t pick the gross amount the Fresh and Sophs did, yet the Juniors made a very good average. So
now, Seniors, you are the only ones left. The three lower classes have made records for you to equal. You
must uphold the honor and might of '20 and we are expecting you to do it. All connected with the
college and all friends.Beauty in §6nd) In “An Artist’s Studio” 17 and 18

CHAMBERS FORGING AHEAD. SHOWERS BEING INSTALLED.

The usual afternoon bathrobe parade from Chambers to Georgia and Watts will soon be discontinued, since the work on the
new showers for the north wing of Chambers is nearing completion. The boiler and piping have been here for several
days and are almost ready to be put in place. The boiler is to be on the first floor and
a shower on the other floors. This improvement is one that was much needed and it will add materially to
the comfort of those rooming in North Chambers. The inmates of Georgia and Watts will also be thankful when the
work is completed, for they will have a better chance at a hot bath.
