WITH THE ALUMNI

R. F. SMALLWOOD ARCHITECT FOR NEW GYM.

During two days of last week Mr. Robt. F. Smallwood, of New York, was on the campus making up the
plans for the new Alumni gymnasium. Mr. Smallwood is a Davidson man of the class of '06, who afterward completed
a course in architecture in Columbia University. He is now in partnership with Mr. Wm. Henry Deacy, in the Associated
Architects, with offices at 569 Fifth Avenue, New York. While in college Mr. Smallwood was a member of the football
team and one of the best punters ever at Davidson. He is now working on plans for several other prominent
buildings in this State and will visit here from time to time while the new gym is being completed.

HOLLISTER WINS MEDAL

The following from the “Charlotte Observer” of September 27th will be of especial interest to the friends of William Hollister,
'16, who is now studying medicine at Johns Hopkins:

“The North Carolina Society of the Sons of the American Revolution offered this year a gold medal to the students
of the University, Colleges and High Schools of North Carolina for the best essay on the subject, ‘Brigadier-General William Bryan,
of Craven County, N. C.’ The gold medal was won by William Hollister, of New Bern, N. C., who is
a great-great-great-grandson of Brigadier General William Bryan. The essay of William Hollister is quite an addition to the Revolutionary history
of North Carolina, and should be filed among the collections being made by the Historical Commission.”

JOSEPH E. HENDERSON

Friends will learn with sorrow of the death on September 25 of Mr. Joseph E. Henderson, formerly of Mecklenburg County,
but for a number of years a resident of St. Louis, Mo. The following notice comes from a Charlotte paper:

“A telegram was received by friends here yesterday (September 25th) announcing the death in St. Louis of Mr. J. F.
Henderson. He was a son of the late McKnit Henderson and Louisa Herron Henderson, of Steele Creek, and was sixty-eight
years of age. Mr. Henderson entered Davidson College after attending preparatory school in Steele Creek and graduated in 1871. He
studied surveying and surveyed the route of the Air Line Railway between Charlotte and Atlanta in 1872. Later he went
West and settled in Dallas, Tex., where he became one of the most prominent men of that city. About 1893
he moved to St. Louis, Mo., where he has since resided.”

There is a movement on foot to start a Wilson-Bickett Democratic Club at Davidson in the near future. The object
of this club is to interest the students of Davidson in politics and with Democratic principles. Similar clubs are being
organized at the different colleges of the State. The club will probably be organized about the middle of this month,
when one of the State Democratic leaders will make an address here.
