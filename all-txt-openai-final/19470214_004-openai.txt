Extensive dragnet, and within the FRAT COURT Virginia Harris. Most of the Brothers and pledges were on hand with justice.

CAROLINA (Continued from Page 2)

No statement was made as to what capacity he was expected to assume. Nation Crowell indicated that the dances were
a complete success in his mind except for the fact that his date was a little upset by the fact
that her application for membership in the Wrightsville Yacht Club had been refused on the grounds that she had no
yacht. Crowell admitted that she was a member of the Lexington Country Club. Bill “Russian Incident” Campbell remained in retirement
most of the weekend. In his single appearance from behind the bleachers during the decoration of the Armory, he stated,
“What a lot of crepe!” before returning to his work.

SIGMA PHI EPSILON

Midwinters has come and gone but is not forgotten. The banquet Friday night at the Ship Ahoy was a good
one, but it seemed to get the best of Thatcher and he was called on his eagerness. Brothers Gregg, Plonk,
Haynes, and Willard really deserve a hand for their program. Ed Lilly’s date was rather perplexed; it seems every time
she asked, he changed the subject and color. Why don’t you draw her a picture, Ed? “Flop,” as usual, made
a couple of short appearances at the dances. Apparently just to be seen there once a night. Boys, watch your
women when T. W. comes around... ask Hurd Bradford. It seems that White had some trouble with a short one
Saturday night and would have choked to death but for Hugh and Jule. Hay really looked as though he enjoyed
thrilling the girls Saturday night, but George Thomason really had a hard time making the rounds. No reports on the
“Wart’s” actions after the dances have come in. Is that good or bad, “Wart”? Congratulations to Christopher for a neat
recoup after a late flush. Blind date honors go to White and Richard Lilly. They must have been living right.
Many, many interesting incidents occurred over the weekend, but yours truly was very much like Winchester (M. C. at the
banquet)... full Friday night, but out of gas Saturday.

KAPPA ALPHA

The pledges of Sigma chapter are all saying “This is it.” They mean that this is the week for which
they have been waiting, the week in which they are to be formally initiated into the Kappa Alpha Order. The
event will take place this Saturday and Sunday afternoons. Brother Jeffries came through again and I think we must admit
that the Mid-Winters Set excelled previous standards. Mac led the Pan-Hell figure Friday night with Miss Virginia Owens, and Brother
Jackson was in there with Miss Virginia Harris. Most of the Brothers and pledges were on hand with charming dates
from all parts of the country. Those who weren't shuffling around the ballroom and Armory were cheering the basketeers at
Duke and Carolina. Brother Jack Layne and Sam Erwin were there, also “Open the Door Richard” Glasgow. The big four,
Hardin, Harris, MacCaulie, and Richardson were actually seen with dates Saturday night... most unusual. A Smith province convention was held
on February 1 and 2 with representatives from all K. A. chapters in North and South Carolina.

All great man.”-——Newsweek. bona fide members can be seen interceding for warmer weather, especially since Freeman engineered a new unwanted
window in the ceiling—plans are discussed for a hot plate canvass to heat the Oak Row—perhaps we should give the
officers sets of red flannels gratis. The casually draped chairs in the lounge are being casually undraped so the brothers
can have back their blankets and bedspreads—at least the place looks lived in—or lived out. Bunny “the Wolf” Goodman has
received several threatening notes, but still declares that he is in love—at least he was on Sunday... we detect Murray’s
handwriting on one of the billets. Again, Goodman has established himself as an entertainer with his “Sassafrass” rendition. There’s still
hope left for the heating problem by the way—we can burn some of the furniture—if the present camouflaged source of
logs vanishes, that is.
