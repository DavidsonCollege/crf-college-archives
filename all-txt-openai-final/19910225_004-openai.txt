If you thought that finding a color Macintosh* system you could afford was just a dream, then the new, affordable Macintosh LC is a dream come true.

The Macintosh LC is rich in color. Unlike many computers that can display only 16 colors at once, the Macintosh LC expands your palette to 256 colors. It also comes with a microphone and new sound-input technology that lets you personalize your work by adding voice or other sounds.

Like every Macintosh computer, the LC is easy to set up and easy to master. And it runs thousands of available applications that all work in the same, consistent way—so once you've learned one program, you're well on your way to learning them all. The Macintosh LC even lets you share information with someone who uses a different type of computer—thanks to the versatile Apple® SuperDrive™, which can read from and write to Macintosh, MS-DOS, OS/2, and Apple II floppy disks.

Take a look at the Macintosh LC and see what it gives you. Then pinch yourself. It's better than a dream—it's a Macintosh.
