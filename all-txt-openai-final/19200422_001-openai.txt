Vigilance Committee Inaugurated By Student Council

Freshmen Restrictions to Be Rigorously Enforced. Hereafter New Men Will Receive Parental Care.

Last fall the Student Council was at odds to know how to solve the problem of hazing, which was continuously going on. This was against the rules of the student body, but it could not be stopped. Finally the Soph class came to the rescue. They suggested the idea of Fresh caps, and it was voted as an amendment to the constitution that Freshmen should be required to wear a cap, but since that time things have been running along in a slipshod way. Some of the Freshmen have been going around as if they owned the campus, wearing caps when they so desired and taking all the privileges of upper class men. But the Student Council has at last hit upon a plan that is going to solve the problem. The students voted on and passed the amendment to the constitution that all Freshmen will be required to wear a black cap with a red button on top and a green F just above the bill. Fresh caps are to be worn all the time except when in full uniform, when the service hat must be worn. He must wear his cap while playing golf and to and from the tennis courts. Upon leaving the hill the cap is to be worn to and from the train. Two weeks from entering college the class must know all the college yells and songs, and will be given an examination on same at the end of two weeks. All first year men must sit in their seats at chapel until the aisles are cleared of upper classmen, and must sit together at athletic games on the hill. In order that the new rules may be enforced a vigilance committee has been appointed from the student body. This consists of ten men from the Senior class, five from the Junior class and five from the Soph class. It is the duty of the members of this committee to see that these rules are rigidly enforced.

There will be a regular meeting of (Continued on page 8)

Wildcats Triumph Over Ancient Rivals

Physical Education Political Science Track Meet

Saturday

N. C. State Defeated 44 to 36. Capt. Murray Highest Individual Scorer

In one of the snappiest athletic contests ever held at Davidson the track team defeated State College 44 to 36. The time was not as good as usual owing to slight showers which made the track heavy. No college records were in any way endangered except in the high jump, in which the time was the same as the record time of Gilchrist, in 15.

“Hack” Murray was the largest individual scorer of the game, getting a total of 18 points. He took three firsts and a second. Brice was next for Davidson with a first and a tie for second, or 7 points in all to his credit. Gentry awoke from his reverie long enough to secure a first and a third, securing at the same time a letter in track. Sutton also added another letter to his collection by taking the first place in the discus throw. Fricker, the star miler, had the misfortune to be pitted against a second Brand in the person of Blakeney, who sprinted the four laps and then wondered when the race was going to start. Fricker was next best, but still lacked two points of gaining the coveted first. For State Blakeney was the highest scorer, taking a first and second. Kraft was next with a first and third, while Parks equalled his score with two seconds. Pell and Albright secured five apiece, Pell taking a first and Albright two seconds, but one was disputed with Brice. Ernst and Lawrence took a second apiece. While their average individual scoring was larger than Davidson’s, yet they had no Murrays to help bring up the grand total.

The track team is to be congratulated on their fine work. They have done what the other D. C. athletic teams fail to do, that is defeat State College.

Location of Blue Ridge

To one who has been to Blue Ridge either for a conference or on some other visit it is useless to tell of the beauty of the place or of its ideal location. No place better suited for this center of Christian training and inspiration could be found in the whole country. It is in the heart of the Blue Ridge mountains about 20 miles from Asheville.

The very buildings are on the side of a mountain and are in easy hiking distance of such celebrated peaks as Greybeard and Mt. Mitchell. Blue Ridge may easily be reached by rail from any point in the south. It is only two miles from Black Mountain and four from Montreat, the famous summer resort. Automobile parties leave almost every afternoon for such points of interest as Biltmore and Chimney Rock. If you have never been to the mountains you most certainly ought to go; if you have been once you will need no urging to go again.

Some time ago a gentleman in speaking of the Davidson spirit, said: “You feel like you are sorry for the fellows that have to go to other colleges.” This is something of the spirit of Blue Ridge.

Blue Ridge Conference June 15th to 24th. Davidson to Have Large Delegation

Delegates of Last Year Express Their Views on the Various Activities of Blue Ridge. Every Man Urged to Go That Can Do So.

If you once go you feel for the fellows that are unable to be there. A spirit of helpfulness and good fellowship pervades the air. In all the things taking place in the form of contests a spirit of friendly rivalry exists. Again it might be said that the Blue Ridge spirit is one of unselfishness. The general atmosphere is a fine and congenial one. Let every man do his best to go to Blue Ridge so that he too will be able to bring back to old Davidson some of the genuine Blue Ridge spirit when he returns next fall.

Blue Ridge the Place to Take Inventory

Nothing great has ever been accomplished without being planned in some quiet, solitary place. Paul in the desert of Arabia, Moses in the wilderness are classic examples. Blue Ridge offers a man a chance to turn aside and take stock of himself. There on the hilltops, surrounded by the grandeur of nature, he can look into himself and ask “What sort of a chap am I, anyway?” A sincere examination of one’s self is the beginning of usefulness.

EXAMINATION SCHEDULE FOR SPRING TERM.

Baptists Bow Before Benders of Buck Currie

Presbyterians Swamp Wake Forest 12 to 1. Visitors Unable to Bunch Their Hits.

Davidson proved that it was still in the running for the state championship when Coach Hengeveld’s proteges took the long end of a 12 to 1 score against the strong Wake Forest aggregation. The Wildcats got the largest percent of their tallies in the first three frames, knocking two pitchers out of the box. The Presbyterians ran wild on the bases twice scoring from second on bunts. Slow fielding and many errors by the visitors marred the game and until the fourth inning, when Barnes mounted the box, it resembled a track meet. “Lefty” Austin, the first moundsman, retired in favor of Griffin in the second inning after seven runs had been scored, but the offerings of the new pitcher looked the same and in the third inning four more runs were added. Wake Forest’s only run came in the initial session, when Kesler scored on an error of Duncan’s slow grounder.

The features of the game were the fielding of Poe in right field and the way in which Currie pitched himself out of the pinches. Poe made two sensational catches, one time running far outside of the foul line and pulling down one that looked impossible; the other time he slipped down on the wet earth but grabbed the pill and held it. Three times did Wake Forest fill the bases only to be disappointed. The necessary bingle was not forthcoming and not one of these men scored. Every inning except the second the losers put men on base, and that is where they stayed until there were three down.

The scoring was as follows: Wake Forest scored in the first. Jenette opened by drawing a pass. He was forced by Kesler at second, but Rapsdale was hit and Kesler advanced. Then Duncan rapped out a grounder which was muffed and Kesler scored. Davidson’s tallies came in the first, second, third and sixth. In the first Ratchford walked but was forced out at second by Cassell. Shepard saw first on an error and Richards received free transportation thereby filling the hassocks. Wrenn hit one to the (Continued on page 2)
