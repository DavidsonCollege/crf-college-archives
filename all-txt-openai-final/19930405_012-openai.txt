Stewart and Spears Lead Men's Track at Emory Classic
For the Women, The Injuries Keep Piling Up as the Season Progresses
By Peter Hurtado

Men's Track
The men's track and field team displayed some depth this past Saturday as they gear up for the Southern Conference Meet in May. With some nice weather for a change, the ‘Cats managed a tenth place finish out of 24 teams at the Emory Classic in Atlanta.

Perhaps the finest effort of the meet was Senior Ian Stewart’s outstanding 10,000m time of 32:03, placing second. Stewart’s stellar effort ranks him third ever at Davidson, and will place him among the Southern Conference’s elite. Senior Dave Kerns was just behind Stewart at 32:29 (fifth) with an outstanding effort of his own. Duncan Spears clocked another lightning-fast 400m hurdle time of 55.3, placing third. Spears is ranked second in the Conference. Lee Sutton regained his form in the shot put, throwing 44’ 1" to place third. Lee should certainly challenge for the top spots in the conference. In the hammer, Rob King’s hurl of 116' 2" was good enough for fourth overall. Freshman Bo Bartholomew, in his third sport here at Davidson, made the mark in the discus at 112' 6". In the middle distance corps, Pete Hurtado (4:06) clocked a fine 1500m, while Joe Beach (2:02) paced the 800m. The men ended the meet with a flourish, placing seventh overall with the fastest 4x400m relay time (3:28.8) recorded at Davidson in several years. The men were led by Spears’ 50.9 split.

Coach Gary Andrew was pleased at the men’s showing in Atlanta. The team gears up for the Conference Meet next weekend at the Duke Invitational. After the Duke and Gamecock Invitationals, Davidson will travel to App. St. for the Southern Conference Championships.

Women's Track
The women’s track and field team continued its spring campaign with a solid effort at the Emory Classic in Atlanta this past Saturday. The Lady Wildcats fought hard and finished the weekend fourteenth out of 22 teams.

Perhaps the finest effort of the afternoon was Karen Marshall’s outstanding 3000m run of 10:45 to place fifth. Marshall can expect to place at the Conference meet either in the 3000m or in the 1500m, where she ran a 4:52 earlier this season. Heather Tarpley placed third in the discus, and remained atop the Conference rankings in the 400m hurdles at 67.1. Maria Whitehead’s triple jump was good enough for fourth overall, while she continued her improvement in the 400m hurdles, placing sixth at 69.4. Carolyn Meadows recorded a fine 3000m time of 11:12, while Hellisse Hoffman ran strong times in the 200m and 400m runs. Injuries have hit the ‘Cats hard this season, but there is not much time to rest before the Southern Conference Championships. Phuong Nguyen and Laura Jordan appear healthy and in good shape with strong efforts in the 1500m, while Jean DeMoss and Jenn Brown continued their recovery in the 800m. Elizabeth Bishop’s knee injury has hampered her stellar season in which she has already broken the school record in the 10,000m run at 38:58. Injury has also slowed a fine season for freshman Marie Grisez. Coach Beth Manson hopes that her women will recover from these injuries in time to score points at the Conference Meet in May. The women travel to the Duke Invitational next weekend.

5K Fun Run Brings Joy and Health to Participants
By Mike Peters & Kelly Davis
The first ever Spring Frolics Fun Run/Walkwas a screaming success. The fifty students, faculty, and alumni that braved health physical activity during a weekend of gluttony and hedonism were well rewarded. The 5K course took the participants from Richardson Hall, around Patterson Court, to the cross country trails and ended behind the Commons. Bob Maydole humbled the overfed leaders of tomorrow with a runaway time of 18:11. Amy Hoffheimer, the top women’s runner, hardly broke a sweat as she finished in 21:59. Runners were divided into four categories and prizes were awarded for the top four finishers in each classification. The top finishers in the faculty/staff category were Bob Maydole, Mike Peters ’91 (19:30), Tom Kazee (20:28), and John Heil (20:42). The top finishers in the student male division were Mark Wittschen (20:11), David Christopherson (20:14), Corey Bean (20:21), Matt Spears (21:59), and Arthur Gaston (22:23). Winners in the student women category were Amy Hoffheimer, Susan Wallace (22:57), Christy Lee (23:57), and Erin Lee (24:21). Sally McMillen, top finisher in the women’s faculty category, Ann Todd, Chad McCall, and Nathan Fenwick deserve special recognition for their over-zealous jaunt after missing the well-marked turn-around point. Everyone else finished with various times that do not really matter; we’re just glad they made it. Fun was had by all. We look forward to even more participation next year!
