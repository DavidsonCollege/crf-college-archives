through a hurt knee, and still winning. He also had to wrestle first, which isn’t easy in his situation.”

After four losses, including a forfeit in the 133-pound division and the disqualification of senior Ryan Owens in the 141-pound
division, the Wildcats bounced back with a narrow victory by sophomore Adam Sperling (149). Entering into the third period, Sperling
and his opponent Eddie Vasques were tied at 6-6, but, with a ride out, Sperling won 7-6.

In the 157-pound weight class, Bender had a decisive victory over opponent Josh Merry. Controlling the entire match, Bender easily
defeated Merry 10-2.

The final Wildcat victory of the afternoon came in the 184-pound division. Senior Jeff Libersat dominated his opponent Cliff Poynter
with four takedowns in the opening period. Libersat won the match in an 8-4 decision.

“Yesterday’s meet showed us that we still have a lot of things to work on,” said Storms. “However, our team
is in no way afraid of or unaccustomed to hard work, so I would expect far brighter performances from us
in the future.”

Sperling agreed, “We’re starting to see signs of improvement, which is always good this early in the season, but with
this, we’re also starting to see the areas which need improvement.”

In his first visit to campus, former WWF wrestler Rick Flair saw the potential within the Wildcat squad as well.
“This will be a great program in years to come,” commented Flair. “[Davidson] has one of the best coaches in
the country, that’s for sure.”
