From ATHLETICS, page 10

The average non-athlete probably misses more from simply oversleeping. If the athlete does not cut any other classes he/she has a respectable attendance record. If a test is scheduled for the day being missed, it seems to me that this is the time that the flexibility afforded us by the Honor Code should be employed. It seems to me that the problems created by the athletic programs are ones that can be handled. The athletic programs here are, on the whole, competitive but do not have that all-consuming nature of the big Division I schools (i.e., Oklahoma and Miami). The sports at Davidson contribute in a positive fashion by bringing excitement, fun, pride, and diversity to the campus. I don’t think it can be denied that watching the basketball game against Marshall last year was entertaining and exciting.

In years past the baseball, basketball, soccer, men’s and women’s tennis teams have through their winning ways brought a measure of pride and notoriety to the school and this year the volleyball team joined the ranks of teams we can be proud of. The football team, despite the record, was a vastly improved team this year. So much so that they led the Colonial League in defense for a majority of the season. The scores also reflected the improvements as they were closer than in previous years. Ignoring these positive steps would be much like nipping the proverbial rose in the bud as it prepares to bloom. If not for the presence of the football team, Davidson would not be a very racially diverse campus either. According to The Charlotte Observer (Nov. 12,1988), in 1983, 22 of 53 black students at Davidson were football players. Included in this figure are black women and black basketball players. Taking this into consideration, it seems that Davidson is not capable of attracting many black students who are not athletes. In contemplating or condemning the state of athletics at Davidson, we must realize that sports on a Division I level create an attractive atmosphere of fun, excitement, pride, and diversity on the campus. Excellence on the field and in the classroom is not only a possibility but a reality. The example of Derek Rucker should be brought to mind, as should the six baseball players who have been drafted in the last three years. The accomplishments of last year’s goalie, Jim Kelly, should not be neglected either. Davidson’s athletic competitors are just as vibrant and competitive as ever, so please do not eliminate an aspect of the school which has done and will continue to do much for Davidson College.

From PARENT, page 10

They have, with effort, been able to satisfy both standards, and so can Davidson. My son, and probably many others on our team, was highly recruited by several Ivy League schools as well as Davidson. It is articles such as the aforementioned and subsequent articles as printed in The Charlotte Observer that seriously undermine the recruitment for next season. Indeed, such articles are an act of sabotage to the football program. One of the article's two conclusions is extremely naive. To suggest that Davidson drop to Division III play is, in reality, another way of reaching conclusion one, that is, dropping football altogether. Because of the size of your enrollment, a little over 1,400, I cannot imagine the lure of Division III play is to certainly call for the end of Davidson Football. The only hope for Davidson football is to continue Division I play, support a rigorous recruitment program, which requires that you lure talent away from Ivy League schools by making this program a unique educational experience and a blend of Division I ball. It’s up to the Trustees to totally understand this and make a full commitment to Division I football if Davidson football is to survive. I firmly believe that this kind of article serves no useful function in a school publication and indeed has overstepped the boundary of good taste and has provided instead an atmosphere of mistrust and betrayal among the student body. While this author seemed at a loss to find more synonyms for the word “lose,” perhaps the college community would be better served if the author was looking up synonyms for spirit, loyalty, dedication, fraternity, Davidson. Has the world in which we live gotten so cynical and callous of others' feelings that we don’t realize how such comments are felt by our student athletes? Consider the players who reported on August 7, 1988, and practiced through the hottest summer in 44 years, played their hearts out in front of home crowds that were comprised 90% of alumni, parents, friends, and local community members. Then perhaps you can understand the anger you have fostered and the wonder of why your paper has tried to destroy rather than build. I can only hope the Trustees have more insight in deciding the fate of a 95-year-old Davidson tradition when they meet on November 28, 1988.
