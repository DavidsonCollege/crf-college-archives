**SGA survey will gauge interest in cable, smoking**

Today’s e-mail survey will provide the SGA with vital feedback on student attitudes toward three pressing issues facing the student
body and administration.

Written by the SEC—Senate Executive Committee—of the SGA, the short survey asks students twelve questions regarding off-campus CatCard use, cable
TV in dorms, and smoking in dorms. The three issues have become a staple to SGA agendas in the past
few years.

SGA President Charles Washington ’04 explained the reasons for each issue.

Regarding off-campus CatCard use, Washington said, “We’ve already convinced the administration that it is a good idea. Once we prove
that students want it, we’ll be well on our way.”

According to Washington, Mayor Kincaid originally approached the SGA with a challenge to “increase student presence in the town of
Davidson.” If the results show students favor the CatCard use, the next step will be to work more closely with
the mayor and businesses on Main Street.

The survey also addresses the issue of cable TV in dorm rooms. Unlike in the past, when cable was a
debated yet unsuccessful venture, Washington said “the issue is now at the top of RLO’s list.”

The financial points of making cable accessible, one of the hotly contested aspects of the topic, are addressed in one
question of the survey. “If you had to pay a monthly fee would you elect to have cable access in
your dorm rooms?”

Washington spoke optimistically about the survey results on cable. “We hope this survey will not only prove that students want
[cable],” he said, “but prove that students are willing to pay for it.”

With cable on the agenda for tomorrow’s CCRL meeting (see related article), the next step will be to “present the
results from the cable part of the survey to them.”

Last spring, an RLO policy banned smoking in all residence halls. SGA senator Roland Foss ’04 circulated a petition last
semester to measure student reactions to the change. According to Foss, the petition got overwhelming support.

He also found the change went practically unnoticed by the student body. “In discussing this issue with others, I found
that many...never even knew the decision had been made,” said Foss via email.

While Washington is more ambivalent about the survey results regarding smoking, he said the SGA will pursue the issue further
if students support bringing smoking back into dorms.

Washington said “[I]f these four questions show that students do feel strongly about smoking, we will pursue this further with
Dean Marsicano.”

The proposal quickly picked up momentum as it garnered the support of several student organizations on campus. In the spring
semester, the SGA passed a resolution supporting Hubbard’s proposal with only one dissenting vote. Hubbard then volunteered to take the
issue before the Union Board, a move that resulted in several board members requesting further information before an official vote
could be taken.

“I don’t think the Union Board’s opinion is nearly as relevant as the CCRL’s as a cross-section of campus,” Hubbard
says, adding, “I’m moving on to the CCRL and opinion polls directed to the student body.”

These opinion polls include both the recent survey conducted by Associate Dean of Students Leslie Marsicano and RLO, as well
as the upcoming online survey focusing on three controversial topics, including off-campus CatCard use, the availability of smoking dormitories, and
cable TV access in dorm rooms.

Hubbard notes that students expressed dissatisfaction with the current cable service in the RLO survey, and he expects the next
survey to reflect similar opinions. With regards to the college’s current Adelphia cable service, both Hubbard and Marsicano have expressed
concerns over stability and efficiency.

The online poll, which will be launched on Oct. 22nd, will likely be instrumental in indicating the consensus of the
student body. It questions whether or not students would support the initiative to whether they would be willing to pay
a monthly fee for the service.

Hubbard says, “There are a number of financial options for [the cable proposal], and once we get the go-ahead, those
can be explored even further and a decision can be made.”

Katharine Hubbard ’05, a member of both the CCRL and the SGA (and no relation to Jack), expects the poll
to influence the CCRL’s Thursday meeting in a significant way.

“I think that the student response will play a big part in CCRL’s opinion on the issue,” Katharine says, adding,
“My ultimate opinion on the issue will come from the outcome of the survey. My job as an SGA member
and member of CCRL is to represent the overall opinion of the student body.”

Jack Hubbard and Katharine Hubbard both place a high value in the CCRL’s decision.

Katharine says, “Since the CCRL is composed of so many different people representing so many different aspects of the community,
its recommendations show the opinion of not just the students but the greater Davidson College community.”
