The Picture

My mother

A bride at twenty-one.
Eyes withdrawn

To thick browshades
Toothpaste teeth

A proper smile

Lips pulled tight
Red and hard

Under a big nose.
White net and skin
She beckons

I, at twenty,

Hide behind a child.

Marriage is for glamour girls
Escaping mothers staidly
The cut of face and family
Are salesmen of her dream
Stamped

For predictability.

Laura Calhoun

Doing their duty

Laughs sound bitter
Smiles grimace

Eyes wrinkle, condemn.
Impatient with affection
All passion choked

In mutiny

Intellectual dignity.
Stamped

With the tired seal

Of property, accountability.
