THE DAVIDSONIAN, MARCH 3, 1922.

THE PEANUT PARCHER

The Way to Get Along With a Roommate.

1. Buy him all the tobacco and cigars he can smoke; fill and light his pipe for him.
2. Introduce him to your sweetheart; encourage him to go out with her.
3. Let him have as much money as he wants. If he offers to pay it back, tell him you
didn’t intend it as a loan.
4. Never argue with him; always admit that you are in the wrong.
5. Write all his English themes and translate his French and Spanish.
6. Let him wear your best shirts, collars, and neckties.
7. Next year—room McGukin—You look sweet enough to eat.
Girl—I do. Where shall we go.

John Adams dropped his pressing club ticket on the floor and Harold McKeithen, stepping on it with hobnails, punched out
four suits.

Nowadays, girls are much like salads, alone, a lot depends on the dressing.

Latest Song Hit Entitled “The Campus Blues.”

A tutor who tooted the flute,
Tried to tutor two tooters to toot,
Said the two to the tutor
Is it harder to toot
Or to tutor two tooters to toot?

When your board is due,
And your reviews are too,
And the hock-shop has got your shoes.
When your friends won't lend,
Nor your parents send,
Then you've got those Campus Blues.

“Trash!” exclaimed the president of the Ash Men’s Union, as the secretary finished reading the reports.

Heard in Brown’s Cafe.
Waiter (taking Walter Knox's order)—“One stew for a bum! He has his own bread.”

Christopher Columbus discovered America, George Washington washed it, and “Pussy Foot” Johnson dried it.

What Is Water Japan?
JAPAN—not the country but a metal-coating varnish—

Totally unlike, yet associated! Ordinary japan consists of a tough, rubbery, tar-like "base" and a highly inflammable "solvent." The solvent
dilutes the base so that the metal may be coated, especially in the baking oven.

Milk is a watery fluid containing suspended particles of butter fat, so small that one needs the ultra-microscope to detect
them. An insoluble substance held permanently in suspension in a liquid in this manner is in "colloidal suspension." The principle
of colloidal suspension as demonstrated in milk was applied by the Research Laboratories of the General Electric Company to develop
Water Japan. In this compound, the particles of japan base are colloidally suspended in water. The fire risk vanishes. Again,
Nature serves industry. Connected with the common things around us are many principles which may be applied to the uses
of industry with revolutionary results. As Hamlet said, "There are more things in Heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt
of in your philosophy."

So the analysis of milk has pointed the way to a safe japan. General Electric Company, Schenectady, N. Y.
