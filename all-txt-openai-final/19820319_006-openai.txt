**2 Seniors Win Watsons**

Two seniors from Davidson, Betsy Thomas and Bill Bargmann, will be joining 68 other students from all over the United
States after winning Thomas J. Watson Scholarships. This $10,000 fellowship allows each student to undertake a research program in a
chosen field of study. Bill will be studying the European Youth Movement, its ideology and its organization, while Betsy will
try to determine the effectiveness of two United Nations programs, the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization
in African countries such as the Ivory Coast and Tanzania.

Davidson College is one of 50 institutions across the United States who nominate four candidates each for the seventy available
places. Criteria such as leadership ability, initiative, and to a lesser extent, academic ability are all considered to be important
in the selection of Thomas J. Watson scholars, and its candidates are expected to have a long-term commitment to their
field of study.

Both Betsy and Bill aren’t quite sure how to react at the moment: “I’m having a hard time digesting it,”
but both are predictably excited at the prospect of spending $10,000 on traveling abroad.

**Rising Costs**

The Trustees met to decide next year's costs, the addition of new faculty members, and to set the ratio of
men to women. A nine percent cost increase has been approved. This increase is based on cost of living and
salary increases. Bob Davidson, the College Comptroller, commented that the college is just trying to maintain operation in the black.
The nine percent increase is an absolute minimum. No major school in the southeast has a tuition increase below nine
percent.

The college has proposed a net increase of two to three faculty members for the 1982-1983 year. This increase will
help the faculty/student ratio at thirteen to one. Dr. Zimmerman said it depends on staffing contingencies as to what departments
will gain faculty. He said it is too early to tell which departments these will be.

There is no set ratio of men to women for the 1986 class. Applications have been flowing in at a
ratio of about three males to two females.

**Prime 750**

Davidson’s new Prime 750 computer has “come up as well as I’d hoped for,” said Dr. Robert DeSieno, head of
the Computer Center. Davidson students now have access to 20 terminals around campus. Dr. DeSieno expects this number to grow
to 25 before the end of this school year. If all goes as planned, there will be 35 terminals available
fall term. Plans for expansion include terminals in the all-night study room and in the College Union.

“We are eager to see the system expanded so that the students and faculty will use it as much as
possible,” DeSieno said. Students currently use the computer for everything from term papers to games. The Computer Center presently has
one letter-quality printer which makes printouts look as if they have come off an IBM Selectric rather than a regular
computer printer. This allows students to write and edit papers on the computer and then have the computer print out
a copy of the paper acceptable for turning in to the professor. The school is planning...

Use of the computer by students and faculty has been increasing rapidly. One of the more popular features of the
computer is the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Departments that are using the SPSS package include Math, Chemistry,
Sociology, Psychology, Political Science, and Physics. The Quips and Cranks photography staff uses the computer to help keep track of
assignments. Even WDAV is using it to record and tabulate the results of a listener poll they are conducting. The
Computer Center now offers workshops on the use of the computer. The workshops are small groups of 6 to 8
people and are taught by Dr. DeSieno and Ed Trumbull. The workshops are open to all students and faculty. Anyone
interested should contact the Computer Center. Widespread interest in the computer has prompted the formation of the Prime User’s Group
(PUG), which was started by seniors Robert Jenks and Jim Northrup, and helps get information about the computer to students
and faculty. There are currently 33 members of PUG. Sign-up sheets for PUG will be up in the Union and
in Chambers next week for anyone interested. All suggestions or complaints about the computer should be brought to the Computer
Center.

Rusk Scholars

So far, at least, Davidson agrees with the Rusk Scholars. Having graduated from their secondary schools at home, seven British
students are joining us for spring term before entering universities in England. They come mainly from St. Paul’s Girls’ School
and St. Paul’s Boys’ School in London and were chosen for the scholarships on the basis of letters and interviews.
Since a fund provided by Dean Rusk pays for their tuition, they are only responsible for personal expenses such as
meals and laundry. Most of them study subjects similar to those they studied at St. Paul’s, ranging from Latin to
Theatre to the Sciences, but they think of their visit to America more as time off than as preparation for
the university. Although these bright young British find some of Davidson’s courses easier than those they took in their last
year of secondary school, they are intrigued by the wider variety of courses found here. At home they had already
chosen a major subject and concentrated in it for a couple of years. Their first-week impressions of Davidson life are
varied: while some say it’s “almost how I expected it,” others say they find the people here “much more friendly”
than they were prepared for. They are still getting used to our dorms, Patterson Court, and the Honor Code. They
describe Davidson as neither better nor worse than British schools but simply “different than what we’re used to.”

Alcohol Symposium at Davidson

Last night, the Y Student Service Corps held a symposium on the subject of drinking and alcoholism. While the general
consensus is that this issue is not yet a serious problem at Davidson, recent instances of vandalism and other alcohol-related
incidents have led to this meeting. “We’d been thinking about holding such a meeting for a while,” said Cathi Dumas,
president of Y-SSC, “and the recent troubles prompted us to organize the symposium, and bring in speakers with a real
knowledge of the problems of drinking to acquaint people with the issue and to offer some advice to those who
think they have a drinking problem or people who are in contact with alcoholics.”
