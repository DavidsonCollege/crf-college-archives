THE DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 28, 1927

AS THE ATHLETIC EDITOR SEES IT
BY RAYMOND LAKE

The recent announcement of the radical change which the famed Knute Rockne intends to make in the line-up of his
backfield next fall must be creating quite a bit of interest among gridiron stars of the country, especially those who
will meet up with the new formation, or shift, in actual battles on the gridiron. It seems that Rockne plans
to have his backfield men turn their backs to the line and go through all their shifts in this position,
then at a certain signal to wheel around just as the ball is snapped and execute the play. This, of
course, will greatly lessen the amount of “pointing” by the backfield men, and will make it almost impossible for opposing
backs to determine where a play is going before it is executed.

When the “crazy quilt” formation was first used, it succeeded to a certain extent in confusing the opposing players, but
this new shift, it seems to us, should prove quite a bit more successful along this line. Imagine the confusion
of a group of players at seeing their opposing back shifting around into various positions with their backs turned, and
then suddenly wheeling and plowing toward them. Of course, the plays will have to be timed almost perfectly, but practice
will accomplish this. If these tricks could have been kept secret and then used on teams who knew nothing of
them and had never practiced against them, there’s no telling what the result would be for a while. Even though
Notre Dame’s opponents do work on the shifts and reduce their effect to a minimum, it will be interesting to
see what they will accomplish next year.

The Wildcats were able last fall to down the Duke University Blue Devils in football without a terrible amount of
work, but when it comes to baseball, we’ll have to hand it to them this year. They came out victorious
in two straight games with the home team, winning the last encounter by a one-sided 11 to 1 score. The
Blue Devil track team, too, is unusually good this year. They beat Wake Forest quite a bit worse than the
Wildcats did, and, if we trust comparative scores, should be able to win over the Wildcats next Saturday. Comparative scores,
however, are a poor criterion to judge by, especially when the Wildcats are concerned and the odds are against them.
The old Wildcat Spirit has won too many battles against overwhelming odds and has caused too many upsets in the
minds of those who trust to comparative scores.

The Wildkittens are showing up good both on the track and the diamond. There is plenty of good material out
for both teams, and, although the baseball team has lost several games, they have shown good form and deserve praise
for their work. The track team has won both of its meets, and promises to furnish some valuable men to
the varsity next year. The first meet, with Catawba, was, of course, more of a practice meet, but the last
meet, with Bingham was no “crip,” and the Freshmen did well to come out on the long end of the
score.

Fresh Take Close Meet From Bingham Academy

The Davidson College Freshman track team defeated Bingham School for Boys, Friday afternoon, in a close and exciting match, 59
to 49, the final event determining the winner. Davidson took seven first places, five of them being in the races,
while Bingham’s strength was in the field and weight events, from which four of their five first places came.

Whittle, of Davidson, took first place in the 220 yard dash, 120 yard hurdles and broad jump, and second in
the century dash to win honors as high scorer with 18 points. McTeer, of Bingham, was second in scoring with
13 points, taking first place in the shot put and javelin throw, and second in the discus throw.

Wildcats Lose to Blue Devils and Tar Heels in Annual Diamond Contests

Carolina Clash Lacks Usual Color and Spirit

In the annual Easter Monday game the University of North Carolina baseball team defeated the Davidson nine by the score
of 6 to 1. The game was played in Salisbury. The University nine scored two runs in the first inning
when Coxe, lead-off man, tripled to center, followed by Mackie’s double and a long sacrifice fly by Hatley, which scored
Mackie. There was no more scoring until the fifth inning, when Carolina scored two more when Coxe again led off
with a double and Mackie followed with one over the right field fence. Cathey took the mound for the Wildcats
in the sixth and before he could retire the side two more men had crossed the plate. In the next
inning he settled down and allowed no more scoring.

The Wildcats’ only run came in the seventh when Duling singled, Kugler walked, Crawford flied out, McConnell, batting for McGeachy,
walked, and Cathey hit to third, scoring Duling. The game was very listless during the latter part, many of the
spectators leaving before it was over.

The Davidson Wildcat baseball nine was easily defeated last Thursday afternoon by the Duke Blue Devils, by a score of
11 to 1. Ineffective pitching and poor support lost the game for Davidson, Johnson’s triple being the only outstanding feature
of the Wildcat's hitting. Ralph Thomas, the right-handed hurler for the Blue Devils, had the Davidson team at his mercy,
allowing only one run and five hits during the entire game, while the Duke team secured 11 counters from 24
hits. Meadows and Cathey hurled for the Davidson team, but they were ineffective, and received poor support. Bad throws and
fumbles aided the Duke scoring, the ’Cats having made seven muffs during the contest. Box score follows:

Wells Pitches Davidson to Win Over Methodists

The Davidson Wildcats defeated the Wofford Terriers on Richardson Field Monday by a score of 9 to 2. The game
was the second one to be played with Wofford, the Methodists having defeated the Wildcats by one run on their
recent Southern trip.

Wells pitched a good game for Davidson, allowing only four scattered hits, and giving a single base on balls. Kirkley
led in hitting for the visitors, securing two of their four hits with a three-bagger and a homer, and scoring
both of their runs. Joe McConnell was the heaviest hitting Wildcat, getting two blows out of three trips to the
plate; he was followed closely by Johnny Dulin, who secured three hits out of five attempts. The Wildcat team, on
the whole, hit well, getting 12 hits. The fielding of the Wildcat players was very good as compared with that
of the Wofford men, the Methodists committing six errors while the Wildcats had only one chalked up against them.

Varsity Net Team on Extensive Trip

On Monday night the Davidson College varsity tennis team left on the most extensive tour of any team which has
ever represented this school. This team will represent Davidson at the State Tournament at Chapel Hill on Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday, and then leave for their Northern trip. The date for the State Tournament was moved up one day in
order that the Davidson team might enter. The men making the trip are: McCutcheon, Carr, Roddey and McAlpine. The former
two are the present doubles champions of North Carolina and have a fine chance of retaining this coveted title. Duke
University is supposed to have the strongest team in the state and is expecting to carry off a major portion
of the honors. All the Davidson men will give keen opposition in the singles, and the doubles team will do
its part.

On the Northern tour the first team to be met will be the one representing the University of Pennsylvania. This
match will be played on Friday at Philadelphia. The next match will be with the team of the Bethlehem Moravian
College of Pennsylvania. This school is known to have a very strong team, as tennis is the only inter-collegiate sport
in which they participate. The following week Colgate and Cornell Universities will be met and a match with George Washington
is pending. This team promises to be one of the best that has ever represented Davidson, and a lot is
expected of them. McCutcheon, Carr and McAlpine have already won their letters in this sport, and Roddy has demonstrated his
ability while playing on last year’s Freshman team. In the only match this year, with Furman, the Davidson team won
an overwhelming victory, losing only one match out of six.

JUNIOR SPEAKING (Continued from page 1)

more sympathetic attitude, and permission to work out their own problems alone. O’Neal’s speech, “Caterpillar Communism,” was the presentation of
a theoretical social system, and a plea for more co-operation and understanding between men in overcoming difficulties between capital and
labor. He compared such a system to a certain species of caterpillars, which live and work together harmoniously, without friction
and misunderstanding. Tyree Dillard presided, and introduced the speakers of the evening. The judges for the contest were Professors Watts,
Currie, and Lyons.
