YMCA Shifts Into High Gear With Renovated Headquarters
By JIM JERNIGAN, Staff Writer

The YMCA hopes to open the remodeled depot in several weeks, according to President Woody Connette. Most of the $10,000 face-lifting has been completed; however, a fence still must be erected between the building and the tracks as specified by the contract reached with Southern Railways.

Although the building will be ready soon, the actual program material has yet to be fully defined. Basically, the depot will be geared for the community's children. Saturday morning movies, elementary art, and craft programs with nominal instruction will be part of the format. Hopefully, the tutoring program will also be expanded.

The YMCA is still looking for activities geared to the college student which are not normally handled by the student Union. A co-op exchange is being explored. This system initially would provide for the exchange of clothing, with possibly crafts and groceries later being incorporated. The YMCA also hopes to become active in the community drive toward improved health services in the North Mecklenburg area.

Connette is fully aware of the need for proper Depot management. Vandalism is an obvious potential problem, but Connette was pleased that nothing was disturbed while the building was being reconstructed.

Evaluation Plan Released (Continued from Page 1)

“Scholarly development of the faculty member teaching it.” Student participation in the evaluation process would be initially through a formal student evaluation of every course and professor. Additionally, any student wishing to give personal evaluations of faculty members would be interviewed by the committee. Alumni would be contacted three to five years after graduation to fill out questionnaires evaluating faculty members, and an assessment would be made of faculty members' contributions to the development of departmental library holdings.

After a faculty member has been evaluated, a file of the entire proceedings would be maintained in the office of the vice president for academic affairs. The proposal further states that “The committee shall advise the president concerning appointments, reappointments, terminations, tenure, and promotions. Where the recommendations of the committee are not followed, the president shall inform the committee in writing of the reasons for his decision. The Committee shall advise the President concerning salary increases for those professors being evaluated. Every four years each faculty member's salary shall be reviewed by the Committee.”

Included in the proposed document is a recommendation to the Board.

OPEN HOUSE

There will be an open house for the entire college on the third and fourth floor of Little on Friday night from 8-12 p.m. Refreshments will be served.of Trustees that a systematic method of administrative evaluation be similarly devised. The CPA suggested that the Board institute a committee composed of Trustees and faculty members to review and evaluate at regular intervals the performance of the college president, vice president for academic affairs, and vice president for finance and development. As an appendix to the major plan, a minority report of the CPA presents an alternative plan for faculty evaluation based on the premise that “the formulation of policy and the implementation of that policy should be separated.” The alternate plan asserts that faculty evaluation is the proper administrative function and responsibility of the Vice President for Academic Affairs and correspondingly of departmental chairmen as he may delegate. Faculty members would be able to appeal unfavorable administrative decisions to the CPA, the plan adds. Criteria and procedures of the two plans are essentially identical except for the minority report's replacing the five-member evaluation committee with the vice president for academic affairs and department chairmen.

"It's important that the faculty see this as a clear-cut issue,” Polley emphasized. “There is some feeling that faculty members should not have the responsibility involved in evaluation. Some feel it would be an overwhelming job for a faculty member, an administrative job which should be left to the Administration,” he added. Public discussion of the working document will formally begin in a meeting of the faculty next Wednesday. “In order to begin getting student involvement and opinions, we'll hold an open meeting on the proposal the week after it goes to the faculty,” Polley said.

College President Samuel R. Spencer Jr. was responsible for securing the contract. In exchange for complete responsibility of the building, Davidson agreed to pay $1 per year. Despite the successful fundraising earlier in the year, Connell is hoping that outside grants will provide the financial resources needed to run the depot. Remodeling costs and the Symposium on Corrections have depleted the YMCA budget. The YMCA is looking for workers to staff the Depot from 3 p.m. to 9 p.m. daily and to prepare the various programs.

Faculty React To Report (Continued from Page 1)
In addition, the college enrolls its employees in a group life insurance plan, and it also grants $1400 to faculty members for each of their children who attend a college other than Davidson. “We should pay more,” acknowledged Vice President for Academic Affairs John M. Bevan, “but this is not always feasible. Budget dictates; we can't always give as much of a raise as we'd like to.

“I am sympathetic to the complaints of individual faculty members in particular situations—the faculty member with five children and two in college feels a squeeze. I think that in terms of salary some are okay and some are not,” he continued. Bevan called for perspective on the issue of Davidson's having to compete with the large universities for faculty members. “Realistically, the highly paid people at the large universities are researchers, not teachers. It is a fact of life that the good researcher has always been paid more than the good teacher,” he said. “Also, the fact that the average full professor at Chapel Hill makes over $25,000 a year takes on new meaning when you realize that this takes into account medical school and law school personnel, who are very highly paid.”
