THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

PAGE TWO FRIDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1960

(All Unsigned Editorials are by the Editor)

The Faculty Still Means Business

We hope that the elation which spread over Patterson Fraternity Court last Tuesday at suppertime has been tempered by some
sober thinking. The effective date of Sophomore Rush was postponed for a minimum period of one year — with the
postponement to be continued indefinitely unless the faculty should determine that the revised program has failed to achieve the desired
objectives. The faculty tied a few strings to its retraction. We assume that the strings become effective immediately—but few fraternity
members seem to have grasped this point. Pledges still carried paddles this week, and they still ran stud. There has
been no formal announcement from President Martin that hazing, no longer couched in abstract terminology, is taboo. But this is
no excuse for us to delay putting into effect the fraternity president’s revised program and adhering to the new Red
Book regulations.

Dr. Goodykoontz said of the fraternity presidents, “I think these leaders deserve the encouragement and support of the faculty.” We
agree. And now that they have the encouragement and support of the faculty, they need the same thing from the
IFC and the individual fraternity members. Without this support, it may have to be proved to us once again that
the faculty means business.

Courage And Compromise

Davidson fraternity men owe a deep measure of appreciation to a man and a group. The man is Dr. William
F. Goodykoontz and the group is the combined fraternity presidents. The presidents did what the IFC and the fraternities proper
could never do: They presented the faculty and student body with a mature, realistic slate of reforms; they realized that
the faculty would not be pacified with proposals shot full of loopholes; they had the courage to make an unconditional
proposal, with no assurance that Sophomore Rush would be retracted as a result of it.

Dr. Goodykoontz scrapped part of his idealism for practical purposes in a move that can only be regarded as a
compromise on his part. For a man so staunch in his convictions, this took an even greater measure of courage.
Perhaps at last, a large portion of the student body will realize that Dr. Goodykoontz was never an idealistic ogre
intent upon tearing down the fraternity system, but a teacher who is most concerned with giving students an education not
diluted by petty harassment.

A Bold And Practical Action

The Student Council’s surprise decision to slice the “under the influence” clause from the drinking rule was a bold and
practical move. We approve of the deletion because we approve of an alcohol-free campus consistent with the realities of the
present drinking situation. The council has already been criticized by some skeptics for undermining the tradition of student enforcement of
an alcohol-free environment. But there is no tradition. In the past three years only one student has been turned in
by a fellow student as “guilty of being under the influence of alcoholic liquors while on the campus.” And there
was no conviction in this particular case.

No Gestapo Here

THE DAVIDSONIAN received numerous complaints this week regarding the 2:00 a.m. room inspection made by the Honor Court and Student
Council Tuesday. The inspection was an attempt to discover if a student had taken $10.00 in treated money that had
been planted by the Honor Court. Students were asked to get out of bed and run water on their hands
to see if they had handled the treated money. The thief was not discovered. Students have commented that the Honor
Court used Gestapo methods by forcing its way into the rooms, that the inspection was an inconvenience to students and
a sneaky way to operate. We feel that the complaints have come from people who are more concerned about their
own self-interest than the effective operation of the honor system. The main issue is that there may be a thief
in the student body who should not remain at Davidson. At no time during the inspection was a student physically
jerked from his bed and dragged to his lavatory. This method would have been used by the Gestapo. We do
not feel that it was too much of an inconvenience for a student to cooperate with the Honor Court when
the enforceability of the honor system is at stake. Members of the Honor Court and Student Council were inconvenienced more
than anyone else. We have received no complaints from them. Finally, the Honor Court has been accused of being sneaky.
Ridiculous. The court could never catch a thief if it had to announce ahead of time when it was going
to investigate and what it was looking for.

Student Council President
Henry Shue, in his articulate letter to the faculty, frankly laid his cards on the table. “We feel that only
the faculty can enforce a rule against returning to the campus under the influence,” Shue wrote bluntly. We regret that
the influence clause cannot be enforced by the student government—but the fact remains, it cannot, and will not be enforced.
The Student Council has been honest and realistic enough to admit this. We agree also with Shue's judgment that to
continue the present policy of duplicity will undermine the Honor System, an institution which we feel is vital to this
college community.

the faculty can enforce a rule against returning to the campus under the influence,” Shue wrote bluntly. We regret that
the influence clause cannot be enforced by the student government—but the fact remains, it cannot, and will not be enforced.
The Student Council has been honest and realistic enough to admit this. We agree also with Shue's judgment that toPresent
trend of applications continues. Between 400 and 500 of these will be accepted. Figures available through Nov. 30 show that
360 applications with $10 fees have been received, 94 ahead of the same period last year. This is an approximate
36 per cent increase. “Of course, this doesn’t necessarily mean we will have an increase in the final total,” commented
H. Edmunds White, associate director of admissions.

INCREASE

“However, though many factors could be involved, it is most likely that a substantial increase will occur. And figures bear
out that much of this increase comes from applicants outside the South. Davidson is coming to the attention of more
and more boys in the North and Midwest, and the number of this group being accepted is likewise rising. The
geographical distribution of the present freshman class, as compared to past years, reflects this significant shift. North Carolina students account
for only 36 per cent of the class, as contrasted to 50 per cent of the student body in 1957-58.

OUTSIDE SOUTH

Virginia and South Carolina have also exhibited slight drops, which, however, have been picked up by Florida, Georgia, and Tennessee.
States outside the South have shown a rise from 3 per cent to 7 per cent for the same period,
while southern and border states not on the Atlantic Coast have also risen 5 per cent.

The final size of the 1961 freshman class will probably continue to remain between 250-260 students. However, the number of
accepted applications could vary considerably from last year’s 447. “The direction this will take is uncertain,” White explained. “Three years
ago, we accepted 500 and then the next year it dropped sharply to 412. You never can be sure just
how many of those accepted will enroll.” The committee will be closely watching the speed at which the $100 required
deposits are coming in from the first two groups. This will afford a more accurate idea of the number necessary
to be included in the April group to assure a full enrollment.

NEW SYSTEM

A new system of acceptance will ease some of those problems this year. Instead of all letters going out at
once, they will be mailed in March and during April. Rejection letters, however, will not follow this schedule. They will
go out as promptly as possible after the rejection is determined. The first group, which will probably be no more
than one-third of the enrolled class, will be composed of those boys with better records, who have completed all requirements
at an early date. Up to another third will be accepted in the March group, leaving roughly a third to
one-half to be accepted in April.

ANXIETY LESSENED

An applicant need not be alarmed if he doesn’t receive an acceptance notice in the first two groups. The admissions
committee feels the usual anxiety over not hearing from an application will be lessened under this plan, with regular acceptance
dates. The boy knows there are three sizeable groups to be accepted on three occasions.

Last year, 24 boys paid the deposit and then didn’t enroll. This was a slightly larger loss than had been
allowed for. This year the deposit fee has been increased from $50 to $100 and it is hoped this loss
will be smaller. The intensive work of the admissions committee (excluding early decision applicants) begins late this month, when the
scores from the December College Boards tests are received.

He shall, in cases where a violation of these regulations has been established beyond a reasonable doubt, recommend to the
Executive Committee such penalties against individuals or fraternities as he thinks just and constructive. For any violation of which an
individual member of a fraternity has been found guilty, the fraternity itself shall be punished if its members, having been
informed of the offense, fail to take appropriate punitive action against the offender.

FINES

The Liaison Officer is empowered to recommend fines of $100 or less against an individual found guilty of violating any
of these regulations; in extreme cases, or where the offense has been repeated, the offender may be dismissed from college;
a fraternity may be fined up to $500 or, depending upon the seriousness of the offense, be placed on probation,
or have its pledging privileges restricted or its charter revoked. All official acts of the Liaison Officer shall be subject
to review by the Executive Committee of the Faculty; and every individual and fraternity adjudged guilty of violating any of
these regulations shall have the right of appeal to the Faculty. A full report will be made to the national
headquarters of any fraternity found guilty of a violation of these regulations.

Nothing in these regulations shall be construed to permit the denial of the basic rights traditionally afforded an accused person
under Anglo-American law.

FOCUS:

By ERVIN DUGGAN

Christmas comes. Merry Christmas, 1960: Let Nothing Us Dismay...

Only fourteen shopping days left. In Charlotte, Christmas brings another performance of Handel's “Messiah,” and two thousand reverent listeners gather
in the dimness of the auditorium. Hundreds of latecomers wait outside.

In New Orleans, James Gabrielle quits his job because of harassment from fellow workers; his daughter, Yolonda, attends William Frantz
School with a score of other children—one of them a Negro girl. Merry Christmas...

In Washington, the Defense Department releases the first photographs of two atomic bombs: Fat Man and Little Boy. It was
Little Boy—the smallest—that fell on Hiroshima. Merry Christmas...

In Atlanta, a small group of colored students spends four hours at a variety-store lunch counter. They are not served.
A sign on the counter reads, “Closed for Repairs.” The store is aswirl with shoppers, and a loudspeaker blares a
carol. The one about good will to men. Only fourteen shopping days...

In Dallas, the pastor of America’s largest Methodist Church prepares his Christmas sermon. The pastor drives a Thunderbird. The pastor,
for a fee, makes “inspirational addresses” at businessmen’s luncheons. The pastor had a street where he used to preach named
for him in Atlanta. His sermon will be a masterpiece: more than one Dallas matron will listen, rearrange her furs,
and dab a tear... Merry Christmas...

Here, we will import a busload of orphans for an evening of warmth and generosity. We do it once a
year. And once a year, as Christmas comes, we write a check to assuage some far-off hurt, to relieve some
far-off poverty, to satisfy some far-off hunger. Merry Christmas.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

McCarty: Let’s Alter Our Fraternity Ideas

Dear Editor:

“For the establishment of friendship on a firmer and more lasting basis... for the mutual benefit and advancement of the
interests of those with whom we sympathize and deem worthy of our regard, we have resolved to form a fraternity,
believing that thus we can most successfully accomplish our object.”

Every fraternity on this campus was probably formed for similar reasons. But do we not find that, notwithstanding the superior
moral tone of Davidson's fraternities in comparison to fraternities elsewhere, that the general temper of emphasis in our fraternities is
the same subtle hedonistic tone of the American Way of Life in general? We have in many cases, let brotherhood
degenerate into a series of associations whereby one may practice the social mechanisms to fit one to be a well-seasoned
social climber and drinker to take his junior-executive-suburban-pretty wife-self seeking place in our American Way of Life, which the Bible
calls the world. There is no reason why we cannot stop this tendency in our fraternities and make them fraternities
indeed.

A few years ago this paper carried a cartoon of freshmen being hammered into the mold of the Davidson Gentlemen
by upperclassmen. Let's face it; sophomore rush would do much to make the freshmen more Christian and less candidates for
contemporary society. But if we will take this time to re-evaluate ourselves and emphasize the true nature of fraternal brotherhood,
we may find that we will do two things—come closer to the way of life that fosters, not retards, Christian
birth and growth and make our fraternities actually fraternities which would be the wonderful home and help of the incoming
students.
