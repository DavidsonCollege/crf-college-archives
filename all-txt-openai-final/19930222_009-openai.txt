Whistlin' Dixie... Bumstead's Top Ten Country Women

A year ago, [came forthwith] a “ranking” of the top ten female vocalists active in country music. One year has gone by, and the position of Queen of the Whistlin’ Dixie court is up for grabs in this the second (and final) Whistlin’ Dixie Top Ten Artist rankings. Next week will be the guys’ chance at winning the coveted prize in this hallowed race.

To remind you of the criteria, they are as follows: rankings are based on a secret formula that takes into account talent, popularity, momentum, sales, success, and, to a minute degree, personal preference.

In 1992, the Whistlin’ Dixie Top Ten Females were:
1. Reba McEntire
2. Trisha Yearwood
3. Patty Loveless
10. Holly Dunn
9. Tanya Tucker

But that was then, and this is a whole cotton-pickin’ ‘nuther year. Today, February 1993, the top ten female artists are...

10. Kathy Mattea - The slip has continued. Two years ago, she was female vocalist of the year. Now, she’s had only two singles on the radio in the past year and a half. First, she was accused of being too far from the mainstream; then, throat surgery kept her off the radio and out of the performance halls. If she doesn’t turn out a big single soon (which she is certainly capable of doing), she could have seen her last glimpse of the big time; but don’t count her out.

9. Patty Loveless - Biggest slip of the year; last year was obviously an over-ranking. Throat surgery hit two of country’s biggest almost simultaneously—Mattea,

8. Kathy Mattea
7. Lorrie Morgan
6. Pam Tillis
5. Wynonna Judd
4. Mary-Chapin Carpenter

Patty Loveless has just signed with Epic Records; now, instead of being her label’s fourth biggest female star (MCA had Reba, Trisha, and Wynonna), she is going to get the full attention of her record company. No one sings a song like Patty Loveless, and she may be able to regain some of her lost ground. Still, she, too, will have some trouble climbing back into the top three.

8. Tanya Tucker -- Although she was 9th last year, that was (and I knew it then, but I don’t care as much for her) an under-ranking. She has actually slipped a little since then. For someone who’s been in the business for over twenty years, though, you gotta like her staying power.

7. Suzy Boggus -- The 1992 Horizon award winner is gaining momentum fast. As I said last week, she only needs some great songs to be able to share in the big slices of the pie. Her voice is over the top and her personality sparkles; give her the material and she could run with it.

6. Lorrie Morgan -- She’s hanging in there with some good competition. “Something in Red” and “Watch Me” have helped turn some heads her way (and the male heads that turn her way usually stay there). She may never be able to get much higher than this, though; she’s taken.

known as the embodiment of compassion. He keeps alive cultural and religious identity as well as hope for many Tibetans. The Dalai Lama, who greets each refugee personally, received the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize. Through all their hardship, the Tibetan monks have not lost a sense of humor. Cheme Tsering personally invited each and every Davidson College student to visit Tibet when peace is restored. “We have many beautiful snow-covered mountains,” he said. “Bring your skis.”
