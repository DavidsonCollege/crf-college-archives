school ground is on the side of a
hill, and it washes with every rain.
But even at that, the basketball
court is the only playing field we've
got.”

“No football? No baseball?” I
asked. “I thought you mentioned
them a while ago.”

“See that rough piece of ground
over by the road? Come on, let's
take a closer look.” We walked
over. “This,” said Miles, “is our ball
diamond. It isn’t even big enough
for a game of baseball.” I looked:
— it wasn't. “But we can play
softball... And in football sea-
son this is the football field too.”

Miles went on talking as we
walked back to the community
house. “You see, there are almost
four acres to the school ground,
but it is so chopped up, ungraded
and uneven that hardly more than
an acre is really fit for use.”

We got back to the house, and
Miles went over to the window.
He stood there a moment, looking
out onto the playing field. Then,
speaking slowly, he said, “This
community center is a good thing.
It fills a definite need. But it could
be much better — don’t you think?”

I didn't have time to answer the
question, because a crowd of little
colored kids were tugging at Miles'
coat, and saying, “Mister, the other
boys've had the ball a long time.
Can we have it now?”

these programs will consist of numbers announced in
advance as well as requests made by
listeners and will take place in
Phi Hall under the supervision of
the music fraternity. It is hoped
that as many as possible will avail
themselves of this method for be-
coming acquainted with good music,
and all efforts are being made to
select the most convenient times
possible for these presentations.
Programs and dates will be pub-
lished on the bulletin board.

In light of the present demand
for improved and additional prac-
tice, rehearsal and classroom space
as well as renovation of present
pianos, a very serious approach to
this situation was taken and the
report of the committee appointed
to study it was heard on Monday
night. Concisely, the result of the
study and discussion was this: In
view of the fact that this institu-
tion functions as a liberal arts
college, it was felt that not only
should conditions for music stu-
dents be bettered but that the
long-range view should be con-
cerned with the establishment of a
Department of Fine Arts, including
an expanded music division as well
as other components now lacking
at Davidson.
