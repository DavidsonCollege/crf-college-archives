Quality— not quantity
A forfeit made the difference against Catawba, but this year’s wrestling team has lots of talent

The Davidson wrestling team lost its first dual match of the season 22-20 to Catawba, but Coach Bob Estock was
more pleased than not with his team’s performance. “We had to forfeit the 118-pound weight class because we don’t have
anybody who wrestles there. But we won five of the other nine matches, and that’s pretty good.”

The previous weekend, Davidson competed in the Pfeiffer tournament. Sophomore Tom Hissam finished second at 117, junior Van Wagner wound
up third at 142, and junior Chris Tiernan finished fourth at 158.

Estock was especially pleased with the performance of Hissam. “This is his first year with us. He did so well
in the tournament that I’ve got to be happy with the job he’s doing.” Hissam is 3-1 so far this
season.

Estock is counting on returning team members for leadership. “Naturally Scott Smith, a senior, will be looked to for leadership,
and he’s up to it,” said Estock. “He’s a leader on and off the mat.” Estock is also looking to
Wagner, who is 5-1 through the first part of the season, and sophomore John Briedenstine (150) who was 20-11 as
a freshman.

Estock is pleased with his team’s progress. “We’re about where I thought we’d be at this point. I’ve been really
happy with the effort we’ve been getting so far. I think for us to be successful, it will just be
a matter of preparing and being prepared every time we are on the mats.”

When there's no more room in HELL, the dead will walk the EARTH.
First there was NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.

There is no explicit sex in this picture. However, there are scenes of violence which may be considered shocking.
