**WDAV begins radiothon**

Organizers of WDAV’s eighth annual radiothon hope to make $130,000 from this year’s fundraising effort. According to John Clark, the station’s general manager, the money will be used “to emphasize quality programming.” WDAV was the first Charlotte radio station to broadcast regularly using compact discs, and some of the money raised will go towards expanding the station's compact disc library. In addition, the station hopes to computerize its entire music library catalog. Remaining funds will help to purchase this spring satellite earth station programming which will provide higher fidelity in concert reception; Clark even predicts that eventually WDAV will broadcast concerts live from Europe. The radiothon, which has featured performances by guests such as Leo Driehuys, conductor of the Charlotte Symphony, Mark Nichols of Spirit Square, and Vivian Nivens of Charlotte Afro-American Cultural Center, will continue through Sunday. Persons wishing to make a pledge should call 892-7777.

**Alexander exhibition in Chambers Gallery**

Ohio artist Greg Alexander will exhibit 34 ink, graphite, and colored pencil drawings Oct. 21 – Nov. 17 in the art gallery. Alexander, of Tallmadge, Ohio, draws in a style known as magic realism. He combines the identifiable with images particular to his vision to produce crisp, natural settings that shimmer with fantasy. Titles to some of his works included in the exhibition are: “Harvest II – pumpkins,” “First Field,” “Cactus,” “Pods,” and “Mourning – Beaver Creek.” Most works are for sale. Since 1978, Alexander’s work has been exhibited over 27 times throughout the United States, including the Cleveland May Show of 1979-80; a one-man show at the Westminster College School of Art, New Wilmington, PA; the 27th Annual Chautauqua National Exhibition of American Art in Chautauqua, NY; and the Apple Gallery of Boardman, Ohio, in 1986. His work stands on permanent display at Westminster College; the Portsmouth Museum, Portsmouth, VA; and in private collections. Alexander, who studied at the Cleveland Institute of Art, has been awarded numerous honors. These include selection for the Smithsonian “Sites” tour of 1983-84, Portfolio Scholarships at the Cleveland Institute of Art, and a Purchase Award at the Portsmouth Community Arts Center.

**THE DAVIDSONIAN**

**Wicker- Continued from page 1**

A factor in this election is that Ronald Reagan cannot run again.The Republicans do not have a worthy successor,” he said, one who could pick up and maintain the public approval that Reagan has kept over the last six years. However, Wicker continued, “If that’s the way a Democrat gets elected in 1988, he would serve only one term. I think that the Republicans would then come back four years from then with a real vengeance and perhaps really achieve the party alignment that they like to think they have already achieved.”

In addition to political prognostication, Wicker offered some opinions about the power of the American press. Quoting President Woodrow Wilson, Wicker said, “The press in this country when used, creates the ‘atmosphere of events.’ The press doesn't cause things to happen so much as it causes them to be received and perceived in a particular way.”

When asked why he thought an estimated 80 percent of journalists voted Democratic, and whether he thought that indicated a tilt to the left of the press, Wicker replied, “There are several reasons for that. I think that the very nature of a reporter is quite different from that of a politician. Innately, journalists tend to be skeptics, to put it more bluntly, journalists tend to be ‘no-sayers,’ they say, ‘No, I don’t believe it, prove it, make me believe it,’ whereas political figures are optimists and believers and ‘yes-sayers,’ they say, ‘Yes, we can.’

“But the ‘Party of Government,’ as I described the Republicans to be, is more of an affirmative party, more of a ‘yes-saying’ party, even though the yes-saying may be naive or foolish. I think that reporters tend to be more skeptical of a party (like the Republicans) than the Democrats, who are divided and in many ways warring and chaotic and seem to represent what reporters see, rather than the unified and optimistic world (of the Republicans),” he said. “The influence of the press is certainly there.”

Referring to the 1984 matchup between Mondale and Reagan, he said, “Eighty percent of the poll (of the press) voted Democratic, they certainly didn’t influence the election much. I don’t think that the impact of the press is measurable, but I am content to say that it is considerable, and often misplaced.”

Wicker touched several times on the Iceland minisummit and the current debate over the “disinformation” campaign from the Reagan Administration. While admitting that “he was not precisely clear as to what happened,” he said that if the allegations of “disinformation” were indeed true, “that is working quite wrongly to influence the press.” He stated that Reagan got in over his head in the Iceland negotiations: “I don’t mean over Ronald Reagan’s head, I mean over the President’s head, because almost any President is not going to be in the position of being in command of every nuance of detail in a subject as complex as arms control, which is why we have teams of professional expert negotiators.”

One thing that did come out of the summit, he said, was one new indelible phrase to the political lexicon: “A sweeping potential agreement.” “I don’t know whether it was more sweeping or more potential; in any case, it was not an agreement,” he noted.

In a panel discussion Thursday morning, when asked if the press was to blame for the decline in the faith of the American people in the federal government, Wicker said, “The whole question of faith in the government rests in the performance of the government. Had there been no Vietnam to report on, there would have been no reports on Vietnam.”

Wicker recalled his memories of Davidson College during his years growing up in North Carolina and at the University of North Carolina. “I can remember when Davidson was considered one of the ‘Big Five’ in football with North Carolina and Duke, Wake Forest and N.C. State, and indeed occasionally won games from one of those schools.”
