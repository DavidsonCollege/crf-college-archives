FOR A BETTER Davidson

Vol. XII DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N.C., MARCH 19, 1925

Hollingsworth Elected Head of Y. M. C. A. For the Ensuing Term

W. T. Covington is Chosen Vice-President—W. A. Christian, Secretary

LEADERS NOMINATED

Hollingsworth Has Made a Name for Himself Since He Has Been at Davidson

At the annual Y. M. C. A. election, which was held Monday morning, A. Hayden Hollingsworth was chosen as president for the year '25-'26, with W. T. Covington as vice-president, and W. A. Christian as secretary. These men were chosen on the first ballot from a number of candidates nominated by the Y. M. C. A. cabinet. Those nominated for president were: C. Barr, A. H. Hollingsworth, R. B. Baie, and D. G. Wilson. The nominees for vice-president came from the rising Junior class. They were W. T. Covington, D. H. Stewart, W. S. Woods, and T. H. Hamilton. Those nominated for secretary were W. A. Christian, J. W. Keerans, and J. A. McAlpine, also from the rising Junior class. All of these men are capable leaders and have the interest of the Y. M. C. A. at heart. They are popular among the students and have shown their ability in many Davidson activities. The present administration has set an example of service and fellowship which will be hard to equal, and the choice Monday morning showed whom the student body thought most capable, and more likely to continue the fine work which the Y. M. C. A. has done on Davidson’s campus.

Aaron Hayden Hollingsworth, Jr., came to Davidson in the fall of '22 from Atlanta, Ga., and has made for himself a place in the heart of every Davidson man. From the (Continued on page 7)

Popular Professor Noted as Poet-Dramatic Reader

Poems Written by Professor Wachter Show Optimism and a Genial Philosophy

Carl Wachter, the Davidson professor presenting the Kipling Recital tomorrow evening, has achieved fame as an artist in fields other than those of dramatic reading. For, with the publication of “Star Glints,” and the growing popularity of certain of the poems it contains, notably “The Happy Man” and “Shakespeare’s Return,” has come rapid recognition of the “poet of Richmond.” “The prophet of the joy of living” has been applied to Carl Wachter, and his verse carries a vital optimism that shows immediately the reason for the appellation. His poems show that same genial philosophy that his students know so well in his lectures and classroom dissertations. Where Professor Wachter, formerly at the University of Richmond, has lectured or appeared in recital he has ever met with success. At times he has given his own poems. These have met with recurring applause. Madison C. Bates, president of the Poetry Society of Southern Vermont, during the past summer remarked not alone upon Professor Wachter’s unusual ability as a reader, but was also warm in his praise of the freshness and originality of his verse. The three poems, by Carl Wachter, which have merited the greatest notice, when he has consented to read them, are: “The Ultimate Conqueror,” “Shakespeare’s Return,” and “The World Builder.” Professor Wachter has not included, and perhaps will not consent to read any of his own compositions tomorrow evening. However, it is hoped that he will be able to appear at some later date in a program, featuring his poetry.

O. D. K. WILL INITIATE FORMER STUDENTS

The Delta Circle of Omicron Delta Kappa, at Davidson, is planning to have a public initiation on April 3. The public part will be in the form of an address and a banquet, the speaker to be announced later. At this time about 30 prominent alumni will be taken in. The purpose of taking in these alumni is to give those who have proved their interest in the college an honor, and a means of creating a closer co-operation between the students, faculty, and alumni. The members from the rising Senior class will be taken in at this time.

Miss Wambaugh of Massachusetts to Speak Here Monday

The faculty committee on public lectures will present in Shearer Hall on Monday evening, March 23, what promises to be an entertainment of unusual interest. The speaker is Miss Sarah Wambaugh, of Cambridge, Mass., one who as author and lecturer enjoys considerably more than national reputation. Miss Wambaugh is a daughter of the celebrated Professor Wambaugh, of the Harvard Law School. She is a graduate of Radcliffe, and has a doctor's degree, having majored in Political Science. She is a member of the Secretariat of the League of Nations, being the expert advisor on Plebiscites and the status of the City of Danzig. She has attended three of the League sessions, and has had unusual opportunities for discussing problems of world-wide interest with the leading international figures of the time. Miss Wambaugh is a very attractive speaker. She enjoys the distinction of being the only woman ever invited to address formally the Institute of Politics at Williamstown, and again last August, when she made a very spirited impromptu reply to Rear Admiral Rogers, who had questioned the sin- (Continued on page 2)

Three Former Davidson Students Make Feature Addresses Before Boys

Murdock McLeod, Dwight Chalmers, and Dunbar Ogden Make Talks

ALL WELL ATTENDED

These Seminary Students Make Deep Impression Upon Minds of all the Fellows

Murdock McLeod, ‘20, and Dwight Chalmers, ‘22, made addresses before a large group of students at Y. M. C. A. vespers Sunday evening. These men, together with Dunbar Ogden, ‘23, constituted a deputation from Union Seminary which visited the campus during the weekend. Ogden spoke at Ministerial Band and again in chapel Monday morning. McLeod based his remarks on the words of Christ, “In your steadfastness ye shall win your souls.” He told of a wrecked life who placed his life before another man for help. The one appealed to could do him no good because he did not have control of himself. “God gave the land, but the Israelites had to go in and possess it. God put silver and diamonds in the world, but man must dig to get them. Columbus had to find what was in the world. But the most sublime thought is that he left man to go in and possess his own soul. “Man's soul was not given to him perfect or complete, but it was given him that it should be made perfect, and Christ is the perfect example of growth.” The thought was expressed that in building up a team there must be both a passive resistance and an active persistence. Our first duty is to enter in and possess our souls, and until the body is made subservient to the soul we shall not be able to possess our souls. The course that Christ chose was the one of duty, of service, where happiness lies—the course where there is the greatest development of mind, soul, and body. As we go step by step with the Master we become like Him, for we become like that to which we attend. If we are not coming into (Continued on page 5)

Will Neal Former Davidson Songster

As an added feature of the Kipling recital, Will Neal, noted baritone of Charlotte, has been secured to contribute several of Kipling’s poems as set to music. Mr. Neal is well known to Davidson, and his songs, sung in his characteristic way and accompanied by Mrs. Coral Hayner Baker, will balance the program to perfection. The first appearances of Will Neal, baritone, as a concert soloist, were made while he was a student at Davidson College. As a leading member of the musical organizations of this institution he took part in many concerts given in the Carolinas, receiving very favorable comment and giving promise of a bright future as a singer of high rank.

**Many Sophs Will Gather at Jovial Feed in Charlotte**
Members of the class of '27 will gather around the festive board in Charlotte tonight for the biggest event of their Sophomore year, namely, the annual Soph banquet. The banquet room of the Chamber of Commerce has been beautifully and appropriately decorated for the occasion; and plans are complete for a gala celebration. Special cars, chartered for the day, will transport the members of the class to and from Charlotte; and the experienced chefs of the Chamber of Commerce kitchen have been busy for several days, planning and preparing dainty and tasty dishes to set before the Sophomore revelers. The banquet will commence at 6:30 this evening, and the festivities will continue for approximately an hour and a half. Following the regular banquet program, the members of the class will likely visit one of Charlotte’s theatres and enjoy an hour of entertainment. A varied and interesting program, in which members of the class and faculty guests will be featured, has been arranged by the committee on arrangements. Ronald Wilson, Don Stewart, K. Brown, K. J. Foreman, and Capt. Julian H. George will be the leading speakers of the occasion.

**Professors C. Programs Taken From Kipling to Include Poems And Songs That Have Gained Fame for Author**
Mrs. Baker in Role Of An Accompanist
To the Kipling Recital tomorrow evening, Mrs. Coral Hayner Baker, of Charlotte, will come to assist in presenting the musical numbers of the program. She will act as accompanist for Mr. Will Neal. For several years, Mrs. Baker directed the culture of Mr. Neal's voice, and he is said to appear to the best advantage when she accompanies him at the piano. For the past two years, the Davidson College Glee Club has been under the tutelage of Mrs. Baker; and the success of the Wildcat songbirds has been largely due to her careful and competent supervision. Mrs. Baker is also the director of the recently organized Oratorio Society, which presented Handel's “Messiah” before a large audience in Charlotte. Newspapers have heralded this latest choral society of Mrs. Baker's as one of the finest in the South. Mrs. Baker is recognized throughout the Carolinas as an artist of the first rank. She began the study of music as a child and at an early age appeared in concert with much success as a pianist. Later she began vocal study and spent five years under the instruction of Mme. Marchesi in Paris. Returning to America, she toured the country as a concert artist with splendid success.

**High School Teams to Vie in Great Meet On Local Athletic Ground**
Cinder Path to Swarm With Lightly Clad Youths Here Saturday
**Crack Teams Entered**
Five Teams Matched for Struggle for the Handsome Loving Cup—Team Prizes
Davidson's cinder path will respond Saturday afternoon with the deep breathing of high school sprinters and distance runners, when six of the leading high school track teams of this section vie with each other for possession of a beautiful silver loving cup, to be awarded to the winner of the invitation track tourney, staged under the auspices of the Davidson College Athletic Association. Six teams have already been entered in the meet, including teams from Charlotte, Winston-Salem, Greensboro, Salisbury, and Statesville. The athletic association will care for the men during their stay here, and will furnish the members of the various teams with dinner on the day of the meet. The events to be included on the afternoon's program are: 120-yard high hurdles; high jump; shot put; broad jump; 100-yard dash; mile run; 440-yard dash; 220-yard dash; 880-yard run; and mile relay. The team that scores the highest total of points will be presented with a beautiful silver loving cup, the trophy being awarded by the athletic association. The Davidson Freshmen will enter a team, but they will not be eligible for the loving cup as this goes to the high school having the highest score. The Freshmen who are out are working hard in preparation for the meet, but Coach Tilson is not satisfied with the number that is out for the team. Charlotte is sending 28 men to enter the meet.

**Prof. Carl Wachter Will be Kipling’s Interpreter**
Popular Professor Will Act in This Distinguished Role Friday Night
When Prof. Carl Wachter makes his first formal appearance at Davidson, in Shearer Hall, tomorrow evening, he will appear in his most distinguished role—that of perhaps the foremost interpreter of Kipling in the country. Rudyard Kipling’s verse under Mr. Wachter’s skillful presentation will be made vivid and forceful to a degree that will reveal to the audience a new conception of the great poet’s genius. Throughout the East and South, Professor Wachter has been heard, where he has met with great success, particularly in this field of dramatic reading. One critic expresses it: “Concerning Mr. Wachter’s powers as an interpreter of Kipling, it is impossible to say too much in praise. He brings the British soldier to life. His dramatic skill is of the highest order. The entire program was satisfying, illuminating, and thrilling. If there is a better interpreter of Kipling, we have yet to hear him.” Professor Wachter is possessed of a voice of rare timbre and unusual range. Coupled with this natural gift is the exceptional one of artistic, dramatic interpretation. As a portrayer of Barrack Room Ballads, with their sketches of soldier life, Mr. Wachter is admirable. He is a master of the cockney dialect. But in the program, prepared for Friday evening, Professor Wachter stops not with humorous selections from Kipling. He teaches that Kipling is more than the “limner of the British Tommie,” that he has gone farther, even into the reaches of the universe for his themes, and has contributed through them to a broader understanding of humanity.
