Lulu Tickled To Meet You

Virginia,

Did you know that you are very beautiful?
—John

Ode to the Princeton Preppy

My Darling Rick,

Roses are red,
violets are blue,
a humorous poem
especially for you.
Wishing you a warm and cozy Valentine's Day in the arms of your beloved... i.e. - let’s get physical!
Hugs and Kisses, Olivia

In the big maroon bitch
We all may go batty
But you and I in New Jersey
Will ditch Mommy and Daddy.

Wishing you the happiest Valentine’s Day Ever!
All my love,
B.C.

To the Nasty Rathole:

Love your cheese

Valentine's Day winks to everybody...
We love you!

Marc—Barns, cows, grocery stores; Jonas’ Ridge, thin hair, thinning hair, “pollen,” bouncing checks, purple, 2555, twin clothes, hysteria and puncture wounds.

Forever, right?

Love, E.
