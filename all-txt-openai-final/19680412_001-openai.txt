Adoption of a public accommodations act by the Town of Davidson was recommended this week by the Mayor’s Community Relations
Committee.

Meanwhile, the student boycott of Ralph Johnson's barber shop “is still holding,” according to Bobby Lane, one of the leaders
of the boycott. The Student Government Association Senate approved a resolution backing the boycott.

The boycott and picketing of the barber shop began April 2, when Johnson refused service to two Negroes. Lane said
that the picketing would probably be resumed Tuesday morning after the expiration of the Monday night deadline set by the
students backing the action, but also noted that the final decision would not be made until Monday night.

Were Davidson to adopt the public accommodations ordinance, it would be the first town in the United States to do
so, said Dr. Tony Abbott, secretary of the Community Relations Committee. Abbott explained that Davidson would probably wait for Charlotte
to adopt the ordinance, and then follow suit. “There is a huge legal problem involved,” he said, and “a town
like Davidson could not afford the court challenges” which would result. Lane, however, suggested that the town would have “no
trouble getting legal aid from NAACP, ACLU, and so on.” Abbott expressed doubt about the direct value of the (See

he has no problems in maintaining his pitch at either end of his range, and his performance bears him out.
The Saxons’ harpsichord is one that they made themselves from a kit sold by a manufacturer in New York, which
is their home base. After each show, the two invite the members of the audience to come up to the
stage and examine the instrument, which is somewhat akin to a piano. “The baroque business is really because we have
a harpsichord,” Solley said, “and we call ourselves The Saxons because baroque music was characteristic of England, where the Anglo-Saxons
had lived. We could hardly call ourselves ‘The Anglos’, you know.” “If we’d been smart, we would have called ourselves
‘The Baroque Folk’,” Goggin added, “but we didn’t think of it in time.”

Committee Emphasizes New Rules Philosophy
By JOHN WILLIAMS
Associate Editor

A new philosophy for rules of student conduct, which would allow drinking on campus and open dorms, is the major
thrust of the Committee on Rules and Punishments report released today. The entire code is based upon the assumption of
responsibility and maturity on the part of the student. It “emphasizes the responsible use of freedom, as opposed to license.”
The consumption of alcoholic beverages is permitted, according to the sixth section, in “private houses, fraternity houses, dormitory facilities or
other areas designated by the college administration.” Drinking would not be allowed outside these areas, and “public drunkenness or irresponsible
conduct encouraged by the use of alcohol” are strictly prohibited. The possession or use of drugs and firearms on the
campus is prohibited. The admission of female visitors to the dormitories will be permitted during certain hours on the weekends.
The code will be enforced through a philosophy of discipline which will allow the courts “to consider each infraction individually
and make its decisions according to the seriousness of the offense.” A joint student-faculty regulations court would be established, consisting
of six students and six faculty members. The Honor Court and honor regulations would remain virtually intact. Additional residence hall
house committees would be set up under the new Residence Hall Association constitution to deal with minor violations of its
rules. The report seeks to revise (See CRAP, Page 6)

Students Plan To Seek Funds
Plans for a student campaign to raise $5,000 to match offers of $100 by two Davidson professors for Negro scholarships
to Davidson are “coming along very well,” according to Larry Slade, spokesman for a group of students organizing the drive.
Psychology professor W. G. Workman had offered to match $2,400 from students with $100 to provide for a Negro scholarship,
and was joined this week by mathematics professor William McGavock in an identical offer. The Senior Class voted Thursday morning
to contribute to this fund as the senior class gift to the school. The amount has not been set. McGavock’s
offer, however, was conditional upon students first qualifying for Workman's offer, which came in response to an editorial in THE
DAVIDSONIAN of March 21. Slade said that students would be asked to contribute to the scholarship fund Tuesday and Wednesday.
Accompanying the scholarship, which would be administered by the admissions office, would be a concentrated student effort at recruiting Negroes,
said Slade. Plans also include an effort to get foundations to offer an equivalent amount of money each year for
the next 10 years. Slade indicated that a substantial showing of student interest would make this funding a possibility.

Bylaws Create New Office, Permit Political Parties
By HUGH MARR
Staff Writer

New bylaws which include a new office of chancellor and provisions for political parties on campus were recommended to the
Senate by the Constitutional Revision Committee Monday. The committee then dissolved itself. The bylaws also suggest the establishment of boards,
councils, and legislative committees as agencies of the Student Government Association, a treasurer appointed by the Senate, and a filing
fee of one dollar per candidate in elections. Both the chancellor and the treasurer are “to be on the order
of civil servants,” according to Mike Bates, committee chairman. The bylaws provide that the chancellor be appointed by the SGA
president and responsible to him, and that the treasurer have had an accounting course. The provisions on political parties limit
the spending of the party to $10 per office for which it nominates candidates, and require the nomination of all
candidates in a convention of all members of the party. Also recommended is revision of the present bylaws to allow
candidates to spend up to $10 in campaigning. Legislative committees, which include committees on finance, the union and social life,
the constitution, bylaws and judiciary, educational affairs, residence halls, and general affairs, are directly responsible to the Senate. They function
in the same way as congressional committees, receiving bills and recommending action on them to the Senate. Boards, which would
be autonomous, would be the publications board, activities grant board, YMCA board, experimental college board, elections board, and public speakers.
Councils, classified as “semi-autonomous” by the bylaws, are the Social Council, the Union Council, the Freshman Council, and the IMAC.
The bylaws also change the composition of the sum- (See BYLAWS, Page 6)

No Sale Made By Bootlegger
A bootlegger visited Davidson College Wednesday in hopes of making a sale to one of the many liquor-starved students here.
According to campus security officer E. N. Linker, several students were approached by a man in an old car on
the road behind the college union. Although there were no actual sales made, it was evident, said the students, that
the man was carrying liquor for sale. The town police were contacted and searched the campus for the car, but
they were unable to find it.
