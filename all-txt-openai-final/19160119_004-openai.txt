The DAVIDSONIAN, January 19, 1916

STUDENT BODY TABOOS HAZING ALTOGETHER

At a student body meeting held immediately before the Christmas holidays, the Davidson student body passed the following resolution, proposed
by the Student’s Council:

“Resolved, That snowballing, water-throwing, dumping, Fresh wetting, etc., be considered hazing and treated as such.”

The resolution was passed with practically a four-to-one vote. On nothing which has happened on the campus in the last
four years is the student body to be more congratulated than on the action which it took in this instance.
This action indicates that Davidson men are giving thoughtful attention to conditions on the campus and are making an honest
effort to improve them. It indicates that self-government in the hands of an intelligent and conscientious student body is the
solution of modern college difficulties. It indicates that Davidson students are putting away childish things and are becoming men.

It is probably in recognition of this fact that the Faculty has decided to give the three upper classes the
privilege which only Seniors have enjoyed heretofore. This is the privilege of leaving the campus without permission at any time
when their absence will not conflict with college duties.

CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS AS SPENT ON HILL

To the twenty men who spent the Christmas holidays at the College, it proved to be one continual round of
pleasure. The townspeople were untiring in their efforts to make the day pass pleasantly, and as usual, they succeeded. Many
visitors spent the holidays here, among them Miss Mary Richards and Miss Mildred Johnston, who were home from Converse; and
Misses Bertie Christenbury, Susie Brady, Louise Campbell, Mary Parks Grey, and Charlotte Cranford, from the State Normal. In addition, as
the guests of Mr. and Mrs. T. R. Withers, were Miss Margaret Blythe, of the State Normal, and Misses Flossie
Harris and Lois Campbell, of Salisbury. Visiting Mr. and Mrs. Ed Lothrevy were the Misses Jamison, of Charlotte. Miss Blakely,
of Charlotte, was the guest of Miss Bonnie Shelton. As the guest of Miss Mary Richards was Miss Eyrene Hudson,
of Winthrop.

On the night of Wednesday, December 29, the students entertained in honor of the visitors in the Social Center. They
were assisted by Mrs. W. J. Martin and Mrs. W. R. Grey. Games, music, and charades made the evening pass
pleasantly, and as refreshments, ice cream and cake were served. About forty guests were present.

The following evening Miss Mary Richards entertained at her home with a “tacky” party. Peppermint candy was served as refreshments.
The prizes were won by Miss Sara Wooten, as a Colonial maid, and Mr. J. E. Johnston, as a Beau
Brummel from the backwoods. This was one of the most enjoyable events of the season.

On New Year's Eve, the usual “celebration” was held on the cupola by the students, using a diminutive cannon and
a Chinese cymbal as the noise-making implements. The college bell rang the Old Year out and the New Year in.
The dormitories were closed, with the exception of Georgia, and most of the boys moved there for the holiday period.
A chess tournament lasted throughout the time.

It was with sincere regret that the student body learned of the death of Mr. C. S. Good, of Greenville,
S. C., father of Fred Good ('16), on the afternoon of December 27.

MISS SHAW REMEMBERED AT CHRISTMAS BY STUDENTS

In appreciation of the many kindnesses and courtesies extended by the Librarian, Miss Cornelia Shaw, she was presented Christmas with
a dainty La Valliere by the student body. The following note has been received from Miss Shaw:

Messrs.J. P. Williams and J. M. Black:

Gentlemen: I write to thank you and through you my friends of the college for the beautiful Christmas gift. In
itself it is exquisite. I shall wear it with keenest pleasure and between times keep it wrapped in loving memories
of the men of 1915-16. For the thought back of it, for the trouble it represents, and for the dainty
La Valliere itself, I thank you from my heart. Hoping that the New Year will bring to each of you
the thing he wants most, I am,

Gratefully yours,
Cornelia Shaw.
