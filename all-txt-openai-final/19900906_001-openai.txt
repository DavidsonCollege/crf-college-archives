### Reforms to Alcohol Policy in the Making
By GARY WHEELER

Last spring’s Greek Week incident in which three Davidson students were taken to the hospital for alcohol poisoning, combined with
the local media coverage that the episode received, has brought Davidson’s alcohol policy under close scrutiny. Although there has not
been any change to the Patterson Court Council (PCC) alcohol policy yet, reforms are in the making. The PCC, which
is responsible for writing the alcohol policies for Davidson’s fraternities and eating clubs, has already met several times this fall
to outline possible changes to the alcohol policy.

A small committee met August 29 to propose additions to the PCC alcohol policy. These suggestions were presented to the
PCC for amendment at its September 2 meeting. The tentative reforms must be re-written and voted on by each eating
house and fraternity before the additions become enforceable.

The proposed additions to the PCC alcohol policy are:
- Weekday parties, Sunday night through Thursday night, alcohol will stop being served at 1:00 A.M.
- Weekend parties, Friday and Saturday nights, alcohol will stop being served at 2:00 A.M.
- At any Patterson Court sponsored party, a party monitor will be present and his or her responsibilities shall include
the following:
- The monitor shall be present any time alcohol is being served.
- The monitor cannot consume alcohol before or while on duty.
- The monitor must have access to a phone, a security officer, and transportation, preferably an automobile.
- The procedures for the monitor to follow in the event of an emergency shall be posted by the phone,
along with the name of the monitor on duty at each party.
- The monitor ensures that alcohol is no longer being served after the appropriate cut-off time.
- A security officer must be present when three or more houses co-sponsor a party and, preferably, at other large
parties.
- A minimum of $40 of alternative food and beverages must be available.

These proposed additions do not go as far as Dean of Students Will Terry would have liked. Terry sent a
letter to each of the national fraternity headquarters this summer petitioning support for broader changes to the alcohol policy. Terry
encouraged the fraternity headquarters to exert “all the pressure possible to see that a sensible, enforceable policy is enacted.”

Some of the changes that Will Terry advocates that are not included in either the existing PCC alcohol policy or
the list of proposed changes are: alcohol served on a BYOB basis, the serving of only beer and wine (not
liquor), and the adoption of a dry rush by fraternities.

### Increased Enrollment Creates Housing Crunch
By CHARLES GRIER

Due to the large size of the freshman class, many freshmen are in triples and upperclassmen were forced off campus.
According to Residence Life Director Richard Terry, there was an increase of 66 in the freshman class, significantly up from
last year.

“We had to create 66 extra spaces, up from 24 vacancies last year. There are 20 triples, all in Belk,
all men. With the women, we were within two from last year,” Terry said.

To handle upperclassmen housing problems, the co-ed eating house PAX, which folded last year, was renovated as dorm space. Around
14 people, mostly sophomores off the housing waiting list, are staying in the PAX house. This was just one of
the options considered to handle the increase, according to Terry.

“We talked about renovating the old gym. All this considered, I think we have done the best we can do,”
Terry said.

However, some students were not able to be housed. Terry says that all...Freshmen are guaranteed housing, while others are not
as lucky. “We are obligated to house all freshmen; we have to set aside enough spaces for the maximum projected
class. Almost Continued on page 4 ~ Class of 1994 Makes Problems As Well As History By BAILEY FOSTER The
large size of the freshman class, the largest in Davidson’s history, is primarily a result of the fluctuating applicant pool,
which produces different student yields from year to year. Though the enrollment is up from last year, the extra students
are causing some inconveniences and adjustments on campus. The admissions process is a complicated one which involves input from many
different areas. The Enrollment Planning Committee, headed by Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid Robert Gardner, meets twice each semester
to determine the number of continuing students. According to Gardner, Davidson, unlike larger universities, does not have an integrated system
in which one office has complete data on the total enrollment, both on-campus and abroad. “Here, it’s a little bit
different,” said Gardner, “because a lot Inside News 3 | Opinions 6 Sophomore Students | Ormand Discusses Spend Time in
the | the Problems with Middle East Eliminating Kegs Campus Living 9 | Sports 13 Joe Maris Reviews Bruce Balestier
Lynch's Wild at Heart | Previews Fall Sports of different people have pieces of information which are not centrally collected,
so instead of an integrated system where one person has a pretty good idea of who’s leaving, enrollment planning is
a new concept here because there’s no real way to gather the data.” Using the estimated figures from the committee
and the yield from the previous year, the admissions office then has to decide how many offers to make in
order to bring the enrollment up to the desired level. The estimated size of the freshman class, according to Gardner,
was about 400. The next step is to decide how many students of each gender to admit, using a male/female
ratio which is set by the Board of Trustees. Beyond those figures, admissions also must decide how many students to
admit from each list, that is early decision, regular decision, and wait list. The yield from the wait list is
usually 100 percent since applicants are under contract to attend Davidson if accepted. “We wanted 400 freshmen,” said Gardner, “so
then you do early decision, based on the pool, subtract off the number of paid deposits; and therefore, estimate the
number of regulars, minus whatever wait-list activity you want to do.” The next step is to play a guessing game
to determine the number of students who will accept. A lot of factors are influential in the process, the most
important being the relative selectivity of the schools with which Davidson competes. “If you think the schools that you compete
with,” said Gardner, “are up in applications and will be more selective, then you want to hold more places on
your waiting list. On the other hand, if you know it’s going to be a tough year where selectives are
down, then you don’t want to hold many spots on the waiting list because those kids may not be there.”
Davidson's yield from regular decision has been about 50 percent overall. However, the yield for men and women was uneven
this year, causing the extra freshmen. “This last year the yield for men came way up, and the yield for
women dropped,” said Gardner. “And essentially we’re over 25 men.” According to Gardner, it has become much harder to predict
the numbers of returning students and incoming freshmen because the yield, which used to be the most steady statistic in
admissions, has been fluctuating in recent years. “The problem right now is that the yields are changing from year to
year,” said Gardner. “What’s Continued on page 4 First Class Mail U.S. Postage Paid Permit #1 Davidson, North Carolina 28036
