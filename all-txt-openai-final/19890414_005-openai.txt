**South Asians stage Bengali drama The Procession**

By LISA GERRARD

The audience sits on the floor while Indian actors in flowing white robes move freely throughout the theater. Dance, pantomime,
and stirring monologues tell the story of The Procession, a unique artistic production coming to Davidson later this month.

The play’s April 24 debut will be a new theatrical experience for most Davidson students and others in the audience.
The production combines Indian, American, and British influences to convey South Asian values with a message for everyone. Student director
Dipankar Mukherjee says The Procession emphasizes the equality of all people and addresses issues that cross boundaries of nationality in
their universal appeal. Mukherjee adapted the play from a Bengali work by Badal Sarcar. An all-South Asian cast maintains the
work’s regional flavor, with Indian chants and songs.

The Procession draws from the Indian indigenous village theatrical tradition of “jatra.” With no stage and plenty of audience participation,
“jatra” eliminates distance between audience and actors to place everyone on the same level. Even the characters are equal. There
is no hero and no one has a name, only a 7-member chorus and an “everyman” persona.

The basic story is that of a man coming to terms with hypocrisy in the modern world. The man recognizes
inconsistencies around him and questions them in a dramatic inner struggle. Educational methods, political corruption, and religious exploitation are confronted
within his awakened consciousness.

Senior Katherine Mallory saw Mukherjee perform The Procession while on the semi-annual “Davidson in India” program last fall. “The play
is not like a history book,” she said. “It’s better because it makes you sensitive to an Indian nationality or
pathos. You get more emotion than facts. I think that India has a lot to teach America and this is
a great way of doing it.”

Professor Job Thomas, director of South Asian studies, met Mukherjee in India last year. Mukherjee had recently completed a master’s
degree in English at Madras College and was performing in his own theatrical company. Thomas was impressed with the talent
of the dynamic young man and took steps to bring him to Davidson. Mukherjee enthusiastically accepted the offer. He is
now considering a communications career here in the States.

Mukherjee’s production is a great step for Davidson’s South Asian program, says Thomas. “It has long been a dream of
ours to bring a South Asian play with an all-South Asian cast to Davidson,” he said.

Davidson currently enrolls 23 South Asian students, and several more are Americans of South Asian descent.

**South Asian students give Davidson experience**

By MUADI MUKENGE

If you ask Anjali Sharma, a freshman at Davidson from India, what her concept of friendship is, she answers, “If
a friend came to me with a problem, they would be my number one priority. Here for many students it
is their test tomorrow.”

This observation in cultural variations is only one of several expressed by South Asian students studying for one- or four-year
periods at Davidson. The college has enrolled an all-time high of 59 international students this year, with the majority made
up of South Asians. Twenty-four are from India while a few come from Nepal, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka.

Each international student adjusts differently to an American way of life, but some of the challenges are common to them
all. Making friends is one, and some Asian students have had more success than others.

Vashist Worah of India found that the presence of several friends from his high school made it easier for him
to meet Americans. He has a very comfortable relationship with his hallmates and says he’s “very happy.”

Sharma had to accustom herself to greeting strangers, a habit not practiced in India. Instead, an introduction is required before
one initiates conversations. Sharma was pleasantly surprised that everyone at Davidson says “hello.”

On the other hand, Dipankar Mukherjee reveals that despite the warm attitudes of the college’s students, it is more difficult
to develop close friendships. This difficulty is aggravated by the fact that everyone is on their own demanding schedule. “America,
relax!” he says, adding, “I want to meet more Americans. I have not come all the way here to meet
my own countrymen.”

Americans alone are not to blame for the problem. Mukherjee adds that international students want to make friends but are
shy and afraid to initiate conversations. Therefore, the majority of them naturally stick together, at the Commons and in their
social circles.

Some Asian students have found that the best way to form friendships is through extra-curricular activities. Sharma is heavily involved
in campus-organized community activities and Mukherjee is acting in the school musical.
