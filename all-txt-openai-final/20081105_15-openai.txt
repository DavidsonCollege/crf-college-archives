continued as the Wildcats dominated the College of Charleston in Oct. 25’s meet at Cannon Natatorium. Megan Madden ’12 had
two wins each. Stegger ’11 also brought home wins. A&T and 184-111 domination of CofC. Anna Stringfield ’11 was named
CCSA Swimmer of the Week after helping the ’Cats to a 2-0 start in conference meets.

Also that weekend, both the men’s and women’s teams were awarded the All-America distinction by the College Swim Coaches Association
for the 2007-2008 academic year, exceeding the qualifying GPA of 3.000. The ’Cats were two of 125 teams awarded this
distinction across the country.

Several women had multiple first-place finishes in either individual, relay, or both. Emily Castle ’11 and Anna Stringfield ’11 each
put up four wins for the weekend between the two meets. Jessica Delgehausen ’11, who won the 1000m freestyle with
the second fastest time in Davidson history (10:26.85), Lauren Kamperman ’12 followed with three wins, and Lindsay Martin ’11 and
Megan Madden ’12 had two each. Stegger ’11 also brought home wins. Divers Kelsey Chisholm ’10 (one-meter diving, 219.23) and

The men’s cross country team completed their 2008 season with a frustrating finish at the Southern Conference Championship. The 8k
race was held on the rolling, grassy trails of the Roger Milliken Research Center in Spartanburg, S.C. Approximately two months
earlier, the Wildcats got the season kicked off in style with a third-place finish at the Eye Opener-USC Upstate, which
was held on the same course as Saturday’s race.

On Saturday, the Wildcats couldn’t overcome the injury bug, which hadn’t been a problem, for the most part, in their
2008 campaign. Two of the Wildcats’ top performers did not finish the race and thus their time could not count
towards the team total. When Coach Andrew was asked about the difficult circumstances, he said, “Unfortunate circumstances for both Alex
[Hoyt ’09] and Tom [Divinnie ’10] obviously hurt us. They gave it their best. Alex collapsed about 100m from the
finish and was unable to finish. He was just behind Lance at that point. Tom had an ankle injury coming
into the race and he made it through almost four miles before being forced to drop [out].”

The race consisted of Davidson and the other 10 teams in the Southern Conference. The Wildcats finished in eighth place
with a score of 198 points, 148 points behind the victorious team from Appalachian State University. The other top-five team
finishers behind ASU were University of Tennessee-Chattanooga (57 points), Furman University (70 points), Samford University (124 points), and University of
North Carolina-Greensboro (126 points).

The Wildcats were led by Lance Harden ’09, who earned second Team All-Conference honors with his 11th-place finish. Harden ran
the race in 25:28. Following Harden were Charlie Schmitt ’11 (33rd/26:24), Ryan Hopkins ’12 (46th/26:53), Ian Tupper ’12 (52nd/27:16), and
Thad Sieracki ’12 (56th/27:28). Other ’Cats finishers were Peter Bruton ’10 (63rd/27:53) and Greg Marcil ’11 (67th/28:13). There were a
total of 88 runners who participated in this year’s Southern Conference Championship.

Even though the season may have ended on a sour note, Coach Andrew was pleased with his team’s effort. “Well,
it didn’t turn out the way we had hoped. Not for lack of effort, though. The guys did [what] we
wanted.” The men’s cross country team will return 10 of this year’s 13 members next year.

The women’s cross country team ended their 2008 season with a strong showing at the Southern Conference Championship. Last Saturday,
the Wildcats finished in fifth place in a 5K race in Spartanburg, S.C. This race was against the other 11
teams that make up the SoCon. Caroline Sanker ’09 led the Wildcats with an individual finish of eighth place with
a time of 18:13. That finish gave her All-SoCon honors for the third consecutive season. Other top finishers for the
Wildcats were Lauren Childs ’11 (21st/18:50), Danielle Ruggieri ’11 (22nd/18:50), Heather Connaroe ’11 (31st/19:02), and Emily King ’09 (45th/19:19). Other
finishers for the ’Cats included Sarah Cline ’11 (64th/19:49), Brooke Senken ’12 (69th/19:56), and Katy Swain ’12 (77th/20:24). There were
a total of 98 women who ran in the event.

UT-Chattanooga claimed the team title with 60 points while Davidson’s 127 points was good enough for fifth place. Overall, the
Wildcats had a very good season which showed a combination of veteran senior leadership and talented lower classmen. Next fall,
the team will return 12 of the 16 runners from this year’s team and will once again hope to compete
for a Southern Conference Championship.
