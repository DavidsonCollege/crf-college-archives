**JANUARY 15, 1931**

Mrs. N. T. Smith was called away last week on account of the death of her sister-in-law, Mrs. Mary Cabell
Smith, who passed away in Martinsville, Virginia, on January 6th. Sincerest sympathy is extended to Mrs. Smith in her bereavement.

"I could not love thee, dear, so much,
Loved I not honor more."
—Richard Lovelace.

### SUGGESTIONS

What was termed as one of the driest years on record throughout the country is developing into one of the
dampest winters experienced by the sunny Piedmont region of North Carolina. Well did the welkin ring in the armory during
the Carolina game the other night. We are not going to take any credit at all away from a fighting
team, but the enthusiastic support of the students didn’t hurt anything.

One wonders how many students noticed the improvements on the walk from the library by the Southeast corner of Shearer
Hall. It was needed.

Quiet in the dormitories is an essential part of examinations. That, and the Students’ Store staying open until two o’clock
in the morning!

It is gratifying to see the response given by Davidson men to Ignace Jan Paderewski, frequently termed “the grand old
man of music.” It is hoped that students will be able to stick to the “code of sportsmanship” which they
adopted in chapel Tuesday morning. It contains the essence of the Davidson spirit.

### THE FIRST STEP

Last week the basketball team waded into and emerged from two of the most strenuous battles on its schedule. Both
of them were victories. Few seasons have ever been started more auspiciously. There is reference to these games and their
effect on Davidson’s standing in the Big Five in another portion of this paper. We do not intend to repeat
what has been said elsewhere. There is, however, a duty which imposes itself on the rest of the student body.

Morale is an important factor in any contest. Not only is this true as regards each man on the squad,
but also does it apply to every man on the hill. A winning team needs support as much as one
which is not so successful. Followers of sports will remember the fate of the old Philadelphia Athletics who were disbanded
because they were “too good.” This should be an unnecessary warning, but over-enthusiasm can prove undesirable at times.

Davidson has always prided itself on its backing of all athletic teams. Because of various negotiations and considerations now in
the making, all records made by its teams may prove of immense value to the college. Every man has his
responsibility. Finally, it takes a good man to stand up under defeat, but it really takes a better one to
retain his poise in victory.

### GENERAL KNOWLEDGE

In a recent edition of a current monthly magazine, an author made an interesting report of an unofficial test given
to approximately twenty-five graduates of leading men’s and women’s schools. Some of the institutions represented were: Yale, Harvard, Dartmouth, Vassar,
and Bryn Mawr. The group was gathered together about the hotel of a Northern resort. There were four Phi Beta
Kappa men in the group, and most of the men and women were in the upper fifth of their classes.
The questions were compiled by an engineer and a professional man, one of whom had had the benefit of little
more than a high school education. Their questionnaire of about 40 questions was compiled briefly and on the inspiration of
the moment; it was not a diabolical scheme to trick unsuspecting college graduates. Most of it was up-to-date, but there
were references to art, music, and history as well as current literature. The reason for its compilation was the rather
condescending attitude adopted by the “young generation” toward those whom they termed “old fogies of dead history.” There was no
perfect paper in the group; the majority of the papers did not pass. What was less encouraging was the fact
that there were whines about the test “being unfair and not a true test of knowledge.” The one who made
the best grade was a man who had never made a high scholastic record but who had done a great
deal of reading. Classical familiarity is an important step toward education, but no one can term himself educated unless he
knows something about those things which are happening at the present time and which raise life beyond a merely drab
existence.

### THE SEMESTER COMES TO A CLOSE

Before another issue of this paper appears, the fall semester of 1930-1931 will have ended. Whether it be in a
blaze of glory or in the pangs of defeat depends much on the individual attainments of the next nine days.
Examinations are here! For Seniors, it should be the next to the last of their undergraduate days; for Freshmen, it
is the first. One is sometimes prone to believe that it is harder for Sophomores and Juniors to see the
progress that they are making than for any other class. At any rate, examinations have come for everybody.

Within them comes a tradition which means more to Davidson men than any of the rest that have been handed
down from class generation to class generation. It is a pledge entered into by every student from Freshman to post-graduate,
an oath of honor! Everyone appreciates the honor system as it operates on the campus. But, perhaps, those who have
been in institutions and those who have seen places where it did not exist appreciate it the more. It is
not a system which is in force everywhere, nor is it a plan which would succeed in every instance. It
exists at Davidson essentially because of the attitude and ideals of the men who have passed through the grind before.
They were men who treasured honor more than anything else. They were men of the old school whose every thought
was enhanced with truth, courtesy, and consideration for the other man. They were men who not only intended for their
given word to be taken literally, but they were men who also considered their implied word to mean as much
as any other. A spoken word was of as much value as an oath.

This system would not have continued to exist if succeeding classes had not given it their support and consent. The
phrase “honor system” has a greater connotation than denotation. A mere definition of the term cannot give an ample meaning
of the value signified. It will not continue to exist except through the united, serious, and cheerful support of students.
We do not believe that there is a single man who would, for one moment, intentionally break down so sacred
a custom. It is only fitting and wise, however, that every man should think seriously of the trust imposed in
him during examinations. Not only do students profit by the honor system, but also does the faculty. It is more
than a convenience for the professor to be able to leave the examination room with the knowledge that every action
will be worthy and above-board. Students have the same privilege, but they should not abuse it. The successful man is
not the man who takes every iota of liberty offered him, but he is the man who uses his freedom
to the best “all-around” advantage to interpret the ideals and demands of the honor system. Every student is acquainted with
them. We do throw out a suggestion, and it is this: Do not test some man’s honor.Distinction of being the
first Davidson student to bring his aeroplane to college with him. Sunny purchased his plane last August after procuring a
private pilot’s license in July, which he received only after passing several tests in flying efficiency and in the knowledge
of government air regulations. Landing was the hardest test the West Virginia lad took, because not only was a three-point
landing required but it was necessary that he stop at a designated spot. A thorough physical examination was also required.
No other Davidson man in the present student body has a pilot’s license. The airship is a Waco, F bi-plane,
has a 125-horsepower Kinner engine, and is blue-colored with a red stripe around it. The passenger capacity is three persons,
two beside the pilot. The young aviator stated that the Waco plane demonstrated its matchless performance by having the fastest
speed, showing the quickest take-off and negotiating the shortest landing of all aircraft entered in last year’s National Air Tour.
It can land and take off within a distance of 50 yards. The flying machine has a top speed of
125, a cruising speed of 95, and a landing speed of 32 miles per hour, and will climb 1,000 feet
a minute. Dual controls can easily be installed in the plane for the purpose of instructing a new flyer.

The youthful aeronaut keeps his plane in a hangar in Charlotte and uses it usually every weekend, flying it around
just to keep in practice. Although he lives in Bramwell, W. Va., more than two hundred miles away as the
crow flies, he can easily fly it in two hours. The license number of the aeroplane is NC-627Y, and as
yet has been given no special name.

Last year, in this column there appeared an article inquiring as to the method used by College Humor in choosing
their representatives in the “Meet These Interesting Collegians” section. No one seems to know. However, many believe that Southern schools
have been repeatedly slighted. Too, many of those appearing in that section are undeserving and merit no such honor, as
compared with men better qualified on other campuses. Last year, Frontis Johnson who finished with the class of 1930, was
easily an outstanding collegian with his two athletic captaincies, Phi Beta Kappa and O. D. K. honors. Unfortunately, he was
overlooked. It is not the purpose of the column to nominate men for that distinction nor to assist the publication
in determining its choices, but this year, Dean Rusk, considered by many the most versatile man Davidson has produced in
years, should certainly be selected by the popular magazine. Dean’s personal popularity, military, social and athletic activities, Rhodes scholarship, potential
honor roll candidacy, and numerous other qualities, easily make him the most outstanding collegian in the Southland, at least. Come
South, and to Davidson, College Humor, and really get a wonderful fellow’s picture in your miniature hall of fame!

No more splendid tribute can be paid Coaches Monk Younger and Tex Tilson than the fact that three of their
most consistent football stars of the past year are men who have never played high or prep school football. Of
course, these three men deserve inexpressible credit and much praise for their brilliant showing in spite of the fact that
their first football knowledge was learned only after they had entered college. The molding of raw material in the person
of new grid candidates into scintillating athletes, however, is the most reliable criterion of coaching ability available. The trio which
has so successfully cooperated with Monk and Tex are Steve Brown, Doc Mathis, and Charlie Parker, all splendid players. Cal
Kuykendall, who is one of Davidson’s promising linemen, is another Wildcat who has never played high school football. And too,
there are several men from the freshman pigskin crew who made their gridiron debut last fall, as a measure of
their initial entrance into the popular game.

Dus Enochs and Woody Calligan have become featured entertainers over Station WBT at Charlotte, we are delighted to announce. The
Davidson pair successfully passed an audition before a committee of critics in the Queen City studio last Tuesday afternoon, and
made such a good impression that they were placed on the program that night. They made a fifteen-minute broadcast, singing
and playing popular pieces and received numerous requests before their allotted period terminated. They are scheduled to appear every Tuesday
night from 10 to 10:15 o'clock. Let’s listen in! This is not a novelty for Dus because he has had
previous experience singing over Station WHIS at Bluefield, W. Va. Woody plays the guitar. The announcer sometimes introduces them as
the “Doodle Brothers.”

Tom McClean is deeply interested in constructing miniature aeroplanes and has some beautiful models in his room, which, incidentally, looks
like a city hangar—with so many planes attractively displayed about it. Tom often goes out to the golf course and
flies his larger ones through “rubber” strength, the little ships sometimes reaching an altitude of 50 feet, and traveling a
distance of a hundred yards before falling.

Reflections: Governor John G. Richards of South Carolina, who was master of ceremonies at the now famous King’s Mountain sesquicentennial
celebration held last fall in which President Herbert Hoover was the honor guest, is a brother of Dr. C. M.
Richards of the Davidson faculty. Sophomore Ben Moseley of Staunton, Va., is an intimate friend of William Haines, the motion
picture star. And Charles Morton, star of “Four Devils” and many other recent moving picture vehicles, is a cousin of
Al Jackson's. The perfect basketball player—Captain Bill Goodson.
