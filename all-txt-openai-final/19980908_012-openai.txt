**Wildcats face UCLA Bruins**

After a rough opening week, things do not get any easier for the men’s soccer team. On Wednesday night, Davidson
hosts the defending National Champions and preseason favorites UCLA Bruins. Even though the Bruins fell to #8 South Carolina on
Sunday, UCLA brings a loaded attack to Richardson Field. Davidson Head Coach Charlie Slagle said, “They are probably the most
talented team in the country.”

UCLA is led by four preseason All-Americans and two Hermann Trophy finalists. The Hermann Trophy is awarded to the top
collegiate player in the country. One of these candidates is Steve Shak, the leader of the Bruins defense. Shak, a
junior sweeper, is a former walk-on who started all of UCLA’s games last season. He anchored a defense that had
fourteen shutouts last season. Shak is one of three Bruins who play for the U.S. Under-23 National Team. Sasha Victorine,
a teammate of Shak on the U-23 team, is UCLA’s second Hermann candidate. Even though Victorine only played in seven
games last season, he is still considered one of the best players in the country. He backed up this claim
with three assists in UCLA’s opener, a 7-0 rout over Cal State Dominguez Hills.

Seth George and Pete Vagenas round out UCLA’s list of All-Americans. George, a senior striker from Mission Viejo, California, was
UCLA’s hero in the NCAA Championship Game. George scored goals in the 80th and 82nd minutes to defeat UVA 2-0.
George has compiled 35 goals and 20 assists in his career. The Bruins' final All-American is defenseman Pete Vagenas. Vagenas
is also a member of the U-23 team. In a recent match against the practice squad of the legendary Manchester
United, Vagenas had a goal and an assist in a 4-1 win for the U.S.

Shak and Vagenas present a very tough challenge for the already struggling Davidson attack. One possible bright spot for Davidson
is that they are facing a relatively inexperienced keeper in sophomore Nick Rimando. Rimando struggled a bit against South Carolina,
managing only three saves. With that said, Rimando is still an excellent keeper as he plays for the U.S. Under-20
National Team. Four other Bruins join him on this team. They are defender Carlos Bocanegra, midfielder Shaun Tsakiris, freshman midfielder
Ryan Futagaki, and sophomore forward McKinley Tennyson, Jr. Last season, Tennyson scored the only goal in a triple-overtime win against
previously undefeated and top-ranked Indiana. In just two games this year, Tennyson already has three goals.

Regarding the Bruin attack, Coach Slagle said, “As much as we can, we can’t let them (George and Tennyson) get
the ball. We must make sure they are always marked, and we’ll have to double-team them at times.” While Davidson
is certainly a big underdog in this contest, victory is not impossible or unthinkable. Still, Coach Slagle and the team
know they are facing a very tough challenge. To win, Slagle said, “We need to take UCLA out of their
rhythm, take advantage of any opportunities we might have, and be aggressive. We can’t give them too much time or
space. We must play our game, which is pressuring the ball, and cutting down angles. We’ve been successful doing this
so far, but we’ve had problems scoring.” If we can break through on the offensive front, an upset is a
real possibility.

**Volleyball celebrates four decisive wins**

The volleyball team opened their season on an impressive note this week, racking up four decisive victories against North Carolina
A&T State, South Carolina State, Elon College, and High Point University.

The girls defeated N.C. A&T in front of a crowd of 122 at the home opener last Tuesday night. Davidson
swept the match in three games, with scores of 15-8, 15-12, and 15-11. Head Coach Lisa Marston expressed reserved confidence
in her team’s play. “You're always happy with a win. But in terms of, ‘Do I think we’re where we
need to be in order to reach our goals?’ We’re not quite there. But I think we definitely are ahead
of where we were last year at this point.”

Mara Mordini (’01) echoed her coach’s sentiments. “We played pretty well for our first game. There were definitely jitters that
we had to get out of our system. But a win’s a win, and you can’t argue with that.” A
5’11” sophomore from Lake Bluff, Illinois, Mordini led the team with 11 kills and 14 digs on Tuesday night. Said
Coach Marston, “We knew she was a great defender last year, we used her as a defensive specialist. But this
year she really has turned it on offensively, and is doing a lot of the things that we wanted her
to do.”

Coach Marston also had high praise for Katherine Lorenz (’01). “She probably impressed us the most (on Tuesday night). We
didn’t know exactly what to expect from her. She tore her ACL last year on the first day of practice.
She’s been working so hard to get back, and she really didn’t think she was ready. Statistically, she came up
with all nine of her digs in the last game, which was absolutely amazing. The top defenders in the conference
are getting four digs per game, she had nine. That was a pretty spectacular game.”

Brooke Bentley also had a strong showing, with 11 digs and 7 kills in Tuesday’s match. Junior Ginny Quis accumulated
35 of the team’s 38 assists on Tuesday night. Mordini had plenty of high words for her teammate, “Quis ran
the offense very effectively... She made excellent decisions at all the right times.”

Another highlight of the game on Tuesday night was the play of junior co-captain Gina Lawrence. “Gina’s preseason was absolutely
amazing,” acclaimed Marston. “In practice yesterday she hit a ball so hard I couldn’t even see where it landed. She
is such a powerhouse, and if she has an ‘on’ match she is absolutely unstoppable.”

This year’s freshman class is expected to inject some punch into the program. Says Mordini, “All the freshman girls are
very, very talented. The Ortega girls are great, but I could say that about all the freshmen. They all gel
well with the team, and offer their own unique talents.”

One freshman in particular, Jennifer Ortega, is seeing quite a bit of court time early on. Jennifer’s twin sister, Jacqueline,
is also expected to be a major contributor this season and in the future. “We heavily recruited them,” said Coach
Marston. “We knew that if they came here that they could contribute pretty early... Jennifer has a starting position... Jacqueline
has amazing athletic ability.”

shared a room at home, they chose to travel 750 miles to Davidson and room together again. The twins’ relationship
is but a microcosm of the camaraderie shared by the entire team. “That’s probably one of the strengths of our
team is that they are such good friends on and off the court. It’s a very good atmosphere,” Coach Marston
explains. The ‘Cats host Radford University at the Baker Sports Complex tonight at 7:30.

The 1998 Lady Wildcats soccer team has come out of the starting gate a little slower than they would have
liked. Unfortunately, Davidson has opened its season with 5-0 and 8-1 losses to the University of South Carolina and East
Carolina University respectively. Last Tuesday night in their season-opener against USC, the Wildcats hung tough throughout the first half. Sophomore
goalie, Winnie Corrigan made five outstanding saves while only surrendering one goal about fifteen minutes into the game. Davidson also
had several shots on goal including one by junior Ginny Dye, last season’s leader in goals scored. The Wildcats optimistically
headed into the locker room at half time only down 1-0, but unfortunately the second half USC increased their lead
to 2-0 and a miscommunication on the part of the Wildcats’ defense led to another USC score a few minutes
later. South Carolina also added two more goals late in the game giving them a 5-0 victory.

On Saturday, the Wildcats headed to East Carolina University in hopes of improving their play and earning their first win
of the season; however, East Carolina proved an extremely difficult foe and Davidson fell by a score of 8 to
1. Freshman Carolyn Stumpf scored the lone goal with about 10 minutes left in the game and East Carolina already
up by a score of 6-0. Stumpf scored the goal off a penalty kick. Other individual standouts for the Wildcats
included three shots on goal by junior Kelly Rennick and eleven saves by goalie Chesley Garrett.

Head coach Kevin Hundley had mixed feelings regarding his team’s first two regular season games. On the one hand, he
was disappointed with the performances, yet remained confident in the team’s ability to learn from the losses and improve their
play in upcoming games. “The losses were tough for a number of reasons,” Hundley said. “The scores were a disappointing
way to start the season. We had a very good pre-season and didn’t anticipate that’s how the game would finish.
We hopefully learned through these situations to better prepare for games in the future.”

Upcoming games include a home game against Wake Forest on September 9th at 5 pm and a September 12th match-up
at conference rival Georgia Southern University.

Women’s soccer team looks forward to challenging season
By ALISON KALETT

There is good news and bad news concerning the 1998 Davidson women’s soccer team. The bad news is that they
have started out the season with consecutive losses to South Carolina and East Carolina Universities and were out-scored 13 to
one in the process. But, as promised, there is good news. The games against their Carolina rivals were only the
first of eighteen matches, including the post-season, on this year’s schedule, giving the Lady Wildcats sixteen more opportunities to improve
their play and capture victories.

Specifically, the Wildcats’ most important games this season include their first Southern Conference match-up on September 12th against Georgia Southern
University. Last year, Davidson lost a one-goal heartbreaker to their conference rivals. The loss proved significant as Georgia Southern finished
only one win ahead of the Wildcats in the end-of-season conference standings. Other key conference games include Furman, Appalachian State,
The College of Charleston, Wofford, and East Tennessee State. Judging by last year’s results, Furman and Appalachian State could be
the Wildcats’ toughest Southern Conference foes. In two match-ups against Furman last year, Davidson either tied or lost in overtime.
The Wildcats also fought Appalachian State to a scoreless tie.

Head coach Kevin Hundley anticipates that games against big-name, out-of-conference programs such as Clemson, the University of Georgia, UNCC, and
Wake Forest will also present tough challenges for his team due to the fact that most of those opponents have
a legitimate chance at qualifying for the NCAA tournament. On an individual basis, Hundley says that the team does not
possess one star player but rather he counts on his veteran players, including two seniors and nine juniors, to rise
to the occasion. “We don’t have one star player,” Hundley said. “We have quite a bit of experience and look
to all of them to do the things they do well.”

Despite Hundley’s reluctance to point to specific players, early individual standouts for the Lady Wildcats include juniors Kate McKnight and
Kelly Rennick who each have three shots on goal in the first two games combined. Also, freshman Carolyn Stumpf of
Virginia Beach, VA scored Davidson’s lone goal of the regular season thus far against East Carolina University. Also, with the
graduation of last season’s points leader Amy Kanoff and All-Southern Conference tournament goalie Ally Nozensky, the Wildcats will be looking
even more to players such as junior Ginny Dye, the 1997 leader in goals scored with four, and senior Rhina
Roberts who finished second to Dye in goals scored last season. The Wildcats also have eight new freshmen additions to
the team and, according to coach Hundley, he hopes to gain significant contributions from all of them as the season
progresses. Hundley says he is pleasantly surprised by the freshmen talent, especially with the play of Carolyn Stumpf, Natalie Cox,
and Penn Graves who all made significant contributions in the team’s pre-season scrimmage or opening games. “We just hoped they
could fit in and give us more players,” Hundley said. “They played really well.”

Looking ahead, the Wildcats must first get past Wake Forest on Wednesday night before meeting conference rival Georgia Southern next
Saturday.
