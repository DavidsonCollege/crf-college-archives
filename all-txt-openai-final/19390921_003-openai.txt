**Sideline Sidelights By ANDY DALE**

Next Saturday another football season opens for the Davidson varsity as they take on the strong and experienced N. C.
State Wolfpack in a game under the arcs at Greensboro. Although the ‘Cats will be outweighed severely, Davidson fans are
once again counting on the Wildcat spirit that has played other teams off their feet in the past. This year,
the underdog opener has the ‘Cats as veteran observers are predicting a feat, but somewhere the spark may burst that
will outpoint favored State. Davidson’s much-talked-of spirit is present still.

Since Davidson beat State three years ago, that game has been the flame into which the ‘Cats' spirit has been
kindled. Last year it could be seen many times as lighter Davidson teams battled opponents to a standstill until the
freshness of rival reserves, something which the 'Cats always lack, told too heavily. Again this year, eleven men will be
out there fighting, backed by a few more reserves, still a team that can pull surprises, a team that will
be fighting back a heavier opponent. A great percentage of the student body will be present in the stands to
give voiced encouragement to their representatives, and although State may win, the Wolfpack will know they've been in a tough
game, and—upsets have happened before.

McClintock and Cowan appear to be sure starters on the flanks, with Frank Niven and Bob Smith to back them
up. Elmer Knoeller, Hank Bahnson, and Dan Cagle are fighting it out for the tackle slots, with the former two
apparently having the edge at present. Two lettermen, George Richmond and Marvin Pennington, plus junior reserve Bob Johnson, have the
upper hand at guard with Pennington practically a sure shot to start, while the other two skirmish for the remaining
guard position. Poss McLean will handle the center duties.

In the backfield, Granville Sharpe, tailback, Bill Bolin, blocking back, and Tubby Hand, wingback, seem to have cinched places. Stan
Yoder and Jay Bolin are both having a lot with the first-string fullback. Dave Spencer, Claude Hackney, and Gene Shannon
are other backs who have been making it tough on the first-string men.

LET’S ALL BE THERE SATURDAY NIGHT!

**Kitten Squad Begins Drills**

Approximately sixty candidates answered the call of freshman coaches Crowell Little and Norman Shepard for the first practice last Wednesday.
After two days of calisthenics and passing, the frosh settled down to more serious business Friday and Saturday with blocking
and tackling forming the most part of the program. Monday and Tuesday were devoted to learning plays.

A typical Davidson team greeted the coaches—light and inexperienced, but willing to learn. There is a scarcity of experienced linemen,
but the prospects in the backfield seem as bright as ever.

**Rooney Will Pace State Offensive**

Davidson's Wildcats will open their 1939 campaign when they meet North Carolina’s potent Wolfpack Saturday night in Greensboro. State’s team
is more or less an unknown quantity. Coached by the crafty William “Doc” Newton, the Wolfpack showed last year that
they were beginning to catch on to their mentor’s peculiar offensive tactics. For the first time this year, Newton will
have under his command boys who have been trained entirely by him. Newton succeeded Heartly Andersen two years ago.

State is not lacking in colorful performers. Fred Gardner, captain and end, is a 200-pound bruiser who is known for
his smashing tactics. Ty Coon holds down a tackle position for the third successive year. Coon is known throughout the
south for his spectacular performances. For the real star of the team, we must turn to the backfield. Art Rooney,
for some reason known as “Little Artie,” despite the fact that he is listed as weighing 185 pounds, has for
two years been a terror to State’s opponents.

**’Cat Schedule**

This year’s schedule, as has been the case in former years, is of the suicide variety. After opening with State,
the 'Cats take on Duke, V.M.I., and South Carolina on successive Saturdays. Following the Furman game, they engage The Citadel
as the feature of the annual Homecoming day. The ‘Cats close with Wake Forest in Charlotte on Thanksgiving.

- Sept. 23—N. C. State (night) there.
- Sept. 30—Duke University, here.
- Oct. 7—V.M.I., there.
- Oct. 13—South Carolina, there.
- Oct. 28—Furman, here.
- Nov. 4—Citadel (Homecoming) here.
- Nov. 11—North Carolina, here.
- Nov. 18—Erskine, here.
- Nov. 30—Wake Forest (Thanksgiving).

The eleven faces above are probably the ones into which Art Rooney and his N. C. State teammates will look
when the opening whistle blows beneath the arc lights of Greensboro’s Memorial Stadium Saturday night. In the line, reading from
left to right: McClintock, Knoeller, Richmond, McLean, Pennington, Bahnson, and Cowan. The backfield: Hand, B. Bolin, Yoder, and Sharpe.—(Staff Photo

**Dormitory Competition To Replace Class Tilts**

This year a new and better athletic program has been arranged for those who do not participate in varsity and
freshmen athletics. “Pete” Whittle, Director of Intramural Athletics, has announced that the program would feature inter-dormitory contests instead of the
usual inter-class competition. Whittle has placed in a stockroom in the gym where students can sign for it each afternoon.
This will remedy the slack often hindered by students who wished to participate in intra-murals but lacked equipment. Three hundred
dollars worth of new equipment of all sorts has been purchased and this will be available for use. The inter-dormitory
competition will begin the last week in September, with the inter-fraternity tournament opening as soon as it is over.The more
that the program is explained, the more it creates interest in intra-mural athletics and allows more people to participate. The
change from inter-class to inter-dormitory competition was brought about because of the great interest shown in a similar contest held
at the end of last year. The usual inter-fraternity competition will also be held. All tournaments will be of the
round-robin type, with the team having the best record at the end being the winner.

New Department. Coach Whittle has announced another addition to the program—a department to create interest in intra-mural athletics and to
allow more people to participate. The change from inter-class to inter-dormitory competition was brought about because of the great interest
shown in a similar contest held at the end of last year. The usual inter-fraternity competition will also be held.
All tournaments will be of the round-robin type, with the team having the best record at the end being the
winner.

In the drills so far, Long, Fredrick, Wood, and Sprunt have shone up best in the backfield. All are good,
while Fredrick and Long will take care of the punting and passing. Rainey and Grosse, guards, and Washburn, a rangy
end, are the best prospects in the line.

We're using more than 250 college papers to tell students of the feats recently achieved by the Parker Vacumatic pen.
To prove it, we filled a Vacumatic with a strong ferric chloride solution (which ate away a railroad spike) instead
of with ink, wrote a 5-mile line with the acid on a revolving paper-covered drum, and finished in perfect working
order.

Davidson Faces Strong State Team In Opener With N. C. State
Coach Gene McEver's Davidson Wildcats are rounding into top shape for the opening game. With only two days away, the
team is formed around its seven veterans—Richmond and Pennington, guards; McClintock and Cowan, ends; Bolin and Hand, backs; and McLean,
center. Two sophomores, Yoder, a 196-pound fullback, and Knoeller, a 195-pound tackle, now hold first positions.

Graduation last spring took from the campus lights of Greensboro’s err Saturday night. Lettermen, Warden and Johnston, McLellan, Fred Stair,
Ned Iverson, Luke Graham, Gasteiger, guards; Bob, and Harry in Bob, fullback; Bill Beaty, halfbacks; Vis, quarterback. The loss of
these men was a severe blow to the team, but with seven returning lettermen including Bob and Bill Da- and
generous sophomore talent, Coach McEver and his aids started work September 1, the 1939 machine being rounded into shape rapidly
and should present a well-balanced aggregation beneath the Stadium lights.

Great preparations are being made. If you'd like to be on the inside on what the WELL DRESSED young man
will wear next Saturday, just go to J. O. JONES, Inc. and see those styled especially for such occasions.
