THE DAVIDSONIAN, DECEMBER 14, 1922

ATHLETIC NEWS

OFFICERS ELECTED BY GOLF ASSOCIATION

The following men have been chosen as officers of the Davidson Golf Association: Doctor Arbuckle, president; Professor Wood, treasurer; J. S. Bachman, manager, and C. W. McRary, secretary. Doctor Arbuckle gave a short talk on the game at a recent meeting of the association, special stress being laid on the fact that golf is first and last a gentleman's game and should always be played with this in mind. He also mentioned a few points of golf etiquette that many people seriously neglect, such as approaching when men are putting on the green. The men were also cautioned to give the usual signal before driving, thus minimizing the danger of accidents.

A tournament will be run off after the Christmas holidays. The team will be chosen from the men turning in the best scores and matches will be arranged with neighboring clubs. It is hoped that in the spring the team will make the trip to Durham for the Olympic games, where they made such a good showing last year. The course is now in excellent condition and many improvements are still under way. One of the most noticeable changes has been made on green number seven. It has a rather novel shape, but is much easier to approach than previously. Golf has had an uphill fight at Davidson, but at last it has been put on a sound basis. New men are coming out every day and are learning to enjoy the game, and who knows, but that future champions will claim Davidson as their Alma Mater?

MANY STARS SHOW UP IN CLASS BASKETBALL

The class basketball games this fall did not draw the large crowds which attended last year, due to the fact that the race for the flag was not close; but it is doubtful if any champion of former years could defeat the well-rounded Sophomore aggregation which carried off the honors this season. The Sophomores scored three points to every one made by their opponents during the season, and in every way deserved the championship which they won so decisively.

The Seniors were the hardest team for the Sophomores to defeat. In neither of the two games played were they able to double the score while against the Juniors and Freshmen they ran up top-heavy scores. The defensive work of the team as a whole, and especially of the guards, featured the games. In the first game of the season, the Juniors were unable to shoot a field goal and only 24 were rung up against them in the six games played. The race for second place honors was the real fight and the Juniors and Seniors came off with the honors even. The Juniors won the first game by a three-point margin and in the second encounter, the Seniors nosed the Juniors out by one point. By comparative scores in the Sophomore games, the Seniors seem to be the best team by a big margin, but in the Freshman games, the Juniors had the best of the argument. In the six games, the Seniors scored 18 points less than their opponents while the Juniors were 28 points behind when the season closed. All in all, the teams were very evenly matched and the standing shows their comparative strength. The Freshmen had a disastrous season, losing all of their starts but showing flashes of form at times which made them dangerous contenders. The Seniors and Juniors both narrowly escaped defeat at their hands, the Seniors nosing them out by one point in the first game, and the Juniors coming from behind to win the season's final contest, 22-16.

The great passwork and defensive play of the Sophomores was due in large part to Mac Beall, who coached them. They passed all around the other teams, piling up large scores, while their guards kept down the scores of their opponents. Ted Koenig captained the team and starred through the season at his position of stationary guard. Boggs and Morrison alternated at the other guard position, Anderson jumped center, and Mitchell and Staley played at the forward positions.

winning two games from the Concord “Y” team and one from Cornelius High, but losing to the Charlotte “Y” team in Charlotte in the final game of the season. The season's record shows 9 won and 1 lost with a total of 303 points to their opponent's 159.

ALL-CLASS BASKET-BALL TEAM HARD TO SELECT

The four captains of the class teams and the varsity letter men each made a first and second all-class pick for the Davidsonian and from these selections was made a composite pick, counting two points for a place on a first team pick and one point for a place on a second team pick. The highest number of points which it was possible for one man to get was 18 and no player was unanimously selected for his position.

At one forward position Mitchell, of the Sophomore team, was selected. Pete was high point man for the season and his left-handed shots rarely missed their mark. He was speedy on the floor and an accurate passer, a hard man to guard at any time. At the other forward position, Staley got the call. Staley made the trips with the varsity last spring, and from his showing in the class series is due to repeat this season. Sickness kept him out of two games, but in his four games his long shots helped the Sophs to pull away from their opponents.

John Anderson was a practically unanimous selection for the center position. He outjumped the opposing center and played a fine game under the basket. He rang up 15 field goals in five games and his presence on the floor steadied the passing of the entire team. Ed Morrison, the midget guard of the Sophs, was given the first guard position. Playing a running guard, Ed has no equal on the floor and is famous for his long shots. Despite his small size, it is the opinion of many players that he has got them all beat and that they would rather play against anybody than Ed.

The vote for the second guard position resulted in a tie between Ted Koenig and Suk Boggs. Ted Koenig, a stationary guard, played a great game and broke up passes to perfection. He forced the opposition to make long shots and still found time to travel up the floor and make several shots himself. Boggs was on the sidelines a large part of the time, but when he did break into the game he showed up as a guard of the first water. He is the heaviest man on the team, but is quick on his feet, pivots well, and guards his man like a leech.

SECOND TEAM

Elkins and Bostick, of the Junior and Senior teams, are the forwards on the second team and in these two men the second team has a pair of forwards who would give the Soph forwards a run for their money. Both are expert shots and play the floor well. At center McBryde, of the Junior team, has the call. This tall and lanky center has shown up well this fall, and with Elkins has been the backbone of the Junior team. Toney and Caddell are the two guards. Although Toney played forward this season he received several votes at guard which is his regular position and was shifted to this position. Joe Caddell has shown up well on the Fresh team and deserves the other guard position.

SOPH QUINTET BEATEN BY CHARLOTTE “Y” TEAM

Despite the fact that the Soph basketball quintet was backed up by an unbroken chain of victories, they met their Waterloo when they tackled the Charlotte Y. M. C. A. team in Charlotte last Thursday night and bowed in defeat to the tune of 46-21. Outplayed by a larger, more experienced and faster basketball five, they merit praise for the game fight they displayed, and the comeback in the second half shows the remarkable Wildcat spirit once more evident. The Sophs made an excellent showing, however, for the “Y” defeated the Badin A. C. composed of college stars, 62-13.

The Sophs were handicapped to a marked extent by the smallness of the court. The boys have been accustomed to using a large court and the differences in size hampered their passwork. The Sophs had adopted the slower and more accurate passwork, but were unable to successfully carry this out. Passes were easily, and often, intercepted by the “Y” players. In the first half the score stood 28-8 with the “Y” leading. Davidson’s team was at sea during this half, but found their bearings in the second and landed at the end of this period with the “Y” slightly ahead, 18-13. This was as good a display of basketball as anyone would like to see, and speaks well for the grit and determination of the Sophs. Were it possible for a return game to be played at the Gym here, it is believed that the score would, in all likelihood, be decidedly closer, with the possibility of a Soph victory.

Without a doubt the star of both teams was Staley. He stands out as the highest point man of both teams, 13 points being chalked up to his credit, followed by Moore, for the “Y” with 12. Staley has played top-notch throughout the season, but this contest easily surpassed any he has participated in thus far. Several of his points were made by long shots, and he sent the inflated sphere through the air with uncanny accuracy. Staley was forced to retire on personal fouls just as the final whistle blew. Three of the fouls were made in the first half, and it is to his credit to have played through the second half until just before the last blast sounded. Boggs held his own at guard in a commendable manner, and when shifted to center, because of an injury to Anderson’s ankle, did not let up on his splendid playing.
