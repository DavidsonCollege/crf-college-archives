First All Music Day Dance To Be Staged; War Memorial Purchased

Phi Mu Alpha will sponsor Davidson’s first All Music Day dance Saturday night in the college dining room. Members of every music organization on the campus will be invited to bring their dates to this function which is timed for eight p.m. Ideas for such a party were resultant from the recent All Sports Day banquet. Members of Phi Mu hope it will become an annual affair.

Slotted on the evening’s program will be a performance by each organization attending. These will include a clarinet quartet, several skits, and numbers by the talented Queens-Davidson Madrigal singers. This latter group practiced popular songs of the 16th Century in its members’ spare time and gave recitals in Charlotte during the past season.

New officers recently named for next year are Charlie Roper, president; Allen Garrison, vice-president; Bill Crymes, secretary; and Morgan Bailey, treasurer. Long-playing records amounting in worth to $25 were bought by the Sinfonians for Davidson’s music library. The records were dedicated to the memory of college men killed in World War I.

Answering recent editorial comment in this paper regarding a chapel trio, retiring president Al Neuman commented, “I don’t think chapel was the place for the trio. Music of that sort was written primarily for the enjoyment of the players rather than the audience. It should have been played in the evening.” He believes Phi Mu will take steps in the future to see that the programs are better coordinated.

Phi Mu Alpha has as its purpose to advance the cause of music on the college campus and in the nation at large. Gamma chapter at Davidson confers membership upon those who show their love for music as their profession, or who work to advance the cause of music. Commonly called Sinfonia, Phi Mu Alpha was organized October 6, 1898, at the New England Conservatory of Music by Ossian E. Mills and thirteen associates. Its organization was originally that of a Sinfonia club, but in 1900 it was determined to expand and form a regular college fraternity in musical schools of approved excellence. A loan fund is maintained to help worthy qualified brothers to remain in school and complete their education. With an active membership of about 20,000 in its 85 chapters, Phi Mu Alpha is perhaps the largest group of its kind.

Seniors, Faculty Collide Tuesday

Athletic grounds here will be red hot with action Monday when this year’s seniors meet picked champions from the faculty at large in an annual senior-faculty day series of contests. Events will start at 2 p.m. Sports used to show the superiority of one group will be golf, badminton, handball, tennis, volleyball, and softball. The individual teams have been carefully selected so as to make the members well proportioned as to their ability. There will be a gala barbecue after the softball game at Erwin Lodge.

As Dr. Puckett expressed it, “We're going to do a better job and we're going to ask you to do a better job.” The faculty has at least taken the first step. The student body—particularly the junior, sophomore, and freshman classes—have the next move.

York, where he was met by his wife. After 107 days of harrowing thrills and experiences under the hot desert sun, exploits that only a privileged few get to experience in a lifetime, his first words upon reaching America were his passionate quip “it’s good to be back.”

Prof. Eberhardt seriously hopes Davidson fraternities will someday invite Arab students to come here as exchange students. Plans to this effect are now being formulated. Also, Prof. Eberhardt hopes to someday take a DC-6 and 40 men from southeastern universities on a two-month tour that will retrace his recent journey. But as for now, we can assure you his lectures starting 2nd semester summer school will be interesting and well illustrated from experience.
