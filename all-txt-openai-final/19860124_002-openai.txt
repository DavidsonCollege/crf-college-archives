**Planning report forthcoming**

A planning report will be released within the next month by the Strategic Planning Task Force. The report will outline
the strengths and weaknesses of Davidson and the task force’s plan for the college over the next 10 to 15
years. The board of trustees requested the report. College President John Kuykendall established the task force. The task force worked
first to identify strengths and weaknesses of the college and later identified potential threats to the school, according to junior
Mark Sandy, a student representative on the task force. Finally, the task force developed strategies to deal with the threats.

The task force examines issues from every aspect of the school, according to Sandy. “The impact the report will have
is really up to the trustees. We will present the report to them which will be about 40 pages long,
and it’s for them to act upon. They may not necessarily agree with it, but they'll determine what happens as
a result,” Sandy said.

The task force includes one trustee, two alumni, five faculty members, six members of the administration, including Kuykendall, two student
representatives, and one strategic planning consultant. Sandy said he expects the report to come out within two weeks. The task
force plans to announce a campus-wide forum on the findings of the report after the report is published.

**Elections council revises bylaws**

The elections council recently revised the SGA bylaws concerning student elections for the first time since 1974, according to elections
council chairman Mickey McDonald. The council formally eliminated offices which no longer exist and changed the responsibility of attending the
candidates’ meeting from the elections council to the student candidate.

In addition to the bylaws revisions, the elections council stressed particular guidelines during this year’s election because of events occurring
in last year’s election. McDonald said the primary problem with last year’s elections was an incident in which a car
parked in front of Chambers was used as a campaign tactic. Though the candidate had the permission of Davidson Public
Safety Director Jackie Hughes and promptly removed the car when asked, the five-member council wanted to prevent further incidents in
which campus regulations may be violated.

McDonald said he has difficulty clearly presenting the ground rules to candidates without being overbearing. At Davidson, in particular, because
of its commitment to the honor code, it is important that nothing occur which is “against the spirit of the
rules or of Davidson.” The election revisions included in the revisions were recently approved by both the Senate and the
Davidson student body and now await approval from the trustees and president. The elections revisions are in section six of
the SGA bylaws and can be found in the SGA offices of the Student Union.

**THE DAVIDSONIAN**

**Students see Tutu speak**

By DAVID WILLIAMS

Nearly thirty Davidson students traveled to Durham Sunday to hear Bishop Desmond Tutu speak at Duke University Chapel concerning his
opposition to apartheid in South Africa. Tutu is presently touring the United States in a campaign to raise funds for
the nonviolent efforts of the South African Council of Churches at abolishing apartheid.

After standing in line for nearly two hours before the Duke Chapel doors were opened to the public, students found
they would have to wait another hour and forty minutes inside the Chapel before Tutu arrived at Duke after debarking
from a previous speaking engagement at Ebenezer Church in Atlanta, where Martin Luther King...was pastor. Students were rewarded by their
wait when the overflow crowd of 2000 gave Tutu, recipient of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, a five-minute-long standing ovation
as he marched down the aisle while the organ trumpeted “How Firm a Foundation.” Tutu focused his 20-minute speech to
North Carolinians on the power of the Church in abolishing apartheid in South Africa and injustice everywhere. He said: “I
come to say ‘thank-you’ for your wonderful love, caring and support. I use words that are utterly inadequate to express
my thanks, but I know that I do speak on behalf of millions when I come expressing their thanks for
your prayers, your love and your upholding of them.” Tutu emphasized that the Church in the United States has provided
much hope to the oppressed black South Africans: “You and I know what it means to belong to the Church
of God and to know that you have brothers and sisters. We have known what it means to be surrounded
by a wall of fire.” The bishop expressed his hope that “the ugliness of this world, its pain and anguish”
can soon be transfigured. “There cannot be freedom for anyone, until all are free,” he said. “We have been to
the mountaintop and have seen the promised land — that God has given us — a new South Africa, so
that all of us, black and white, can say, ‘Free at last! free at last!’” Tutu has been at odds
with the white South African government and with American opponents of economic sanctions against South Africa because of his views.
College Chaplain Charlie Summers sponsored the trip.

Adair speaks on peacemaking
By ANDY BALL

“Drink deep of past history to see the folly and results of war. See the points of intervention and see
how the course of history could have been changed.” Dr. Thelma Adair delivered this message in Wednesday’s Open Luncheon. She
said that her speech, titled “The Strategies of Peacemaking,” drew upon her own personal experiences and observations in order to
address issues such as racial and sexual discrimination and the growing emphasis on military development throughout the world. Rather than
treat these subjects separately, she asked the audience to consider them in the same light.

“People need to see the interrelatedness between racism, sexism, materialism and militarism,” Adair said. The solution to these problems, she
added, lies both within the individual and within the group. She emphasized the need for effective coalitions of individuals all
united toward a certain goal, citing the civil rights movement of the 60s, led by the late Martin Luther King
Jr., as a prime example. A recent visit to a classroom of small schoolchildren, both black and white, convinced her
of the success of such coalitions. “I have seen ‘the dream’ visible,” she said.

Concerning world peace, Adair said mankind must “try to become sensitive to the ultimate terror we face from the possibility
of a nuclear war, so sensitive that we are willing to find out ways of speaking out against such.” She
added, “Although we must maintain security, we must also find a voice to say ‘no!’” Adair urged the audience to
exercise their right to vote as an effective voice for peace: “The power of your vote is there. It is
the gift of America and your most priceless possession.” She said, “People need to contrive to say that fragile planet
earth does not deserve to be destroyed.”
