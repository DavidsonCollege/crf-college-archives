CO-ED EATING, from page 11

years, it would be logical to conclude that the majority of Davidson students, past and present, find it more artificial
to be a member of a co-ed house than it is to be a member of a single-sex house. Lucia
then proposes that the decline of co-ed eating is probably the result of the members of a co-ed eating house
being labeled as “weird” and “different.” Give us some credit. All (or at least the vast majority of) students at
Davidson are normal, well-adjusted human beings. The degree of intellectual development which this college requires for admittance also seems to
imply maturity on the part of the individual. I know of no mature person who, just on the basis of
social affiliation, would label a co-ed eater as weird. If you look at any eating house, you will find some
members who are radically different than the other members of that house. It is very disappointing to hear that Lucia
feels that Davidson is a community of people who are all basically alike and ostracize those who are different. I
know that this is not the case. In every house, male or female, there are examples of members who do
not fit into the “norms” of society yet are readily accepted (guys with long hair and earrings, women who do
not shave, people of religions other than Christianity). This is what makes Davidson so great. There are very few small
communities like this where people can be accepted for who they are. Furthermore, a person who wants to join a
co-ed house should not be deterred by the opinions of others. I have no sympathy for someone who cannot make
a choice based on what they really want. I will admit that it is not easy to go against what
everyone else is doing. Yet, at a time when there were five or sixco-ed houses, surely co-ed eaters were not
the minority that they were last year or last semester. This should have made it relatively easier for a person
to join a co-ed house. He or she would not have been the outcast that Lucia proposes co-ed eaters were
and are. Instead, he or she would have been a member of an accepted social alternative, even if co-ed eaters
were in the minority. Thus, to blame the failure of growth in the co-ed houses on the single-sex houses is
ridiculous. Enough on the decline of co-ed eating houses. Single-sex eating is not the social isolation and evil which Lucia
tries to imply. There must be some overriding positive factor which causes the vast majority of people to choose them
over co-ed houses. I think that this reason is obvious. People of the same sex feel more comfortable around members
of the same sex. This is due to the very similarities which Lucia mentions in her article. Guys like to
be able to go to dinner and be slobs. Girls do not want to have to wear makeup every time
they go to their house. Members of both sexes generally feel more comfortable talking about problems of their gender with
other members of that gender. Members of the same sex tend to understand and relate better to physical and social
problems, as they are more likely to have experienced the same problems. This is not to say that guys and
girls cannot be open with one another, but that there are some things which members of the same sex can
share on a different level than they can with members of the opposite sex. I would also like to know
if Lucia has considered that her argument blatantly shoots itself in the foot. She clearly states that there is generally
an open relationship (and positive one) between members of all Patterson Court houses. If this relationship, based on friendship and
trust, already exists between the single-sex houses, then why do the majority of people, who are happy with their relationships
with others, need to change? By transforming a system which already pleases such a large number of students, we would
be going against the ideals of all the current members of the court. I realize that Lucia is not proposing
that the houses all go co-ed. In turn, I hope that Lucia realizes that the co-ed eating houses failed because
the majority of people found something more appealing about the single-sex houses. It is time for her to come to
grips with the fact that her preference failed. I do not mean to suggest that the co-ed houses were inherently
negative, just that people weighed their choices and found that they could have strong relationships with members of the opposite
sex and belong to one of the current social organizations. Come on, Lucia, and see the truth for what it
is, instead of what you would like it to be.
