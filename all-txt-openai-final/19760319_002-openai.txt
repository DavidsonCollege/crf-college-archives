The Reverend Theodore M. Hesburgh has been selected as the main speaker at the Davidson College Spring Convocation.

Father Hesburgh, current president of Notre Dame University, has been a prominent figure on the national level for several years, particularly in the area of civil rights. He was appointed to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights when the Commission was established in 1957 and served as its chairman from 1969 until his resignation in 1972.

Hesburgh’s contributions in the field of education have also been outstanding. He served as president of the International Federation of Catholic Universities and was a member of the Kerr-Carnegie Commission on the Future of Higher Education. Hesburgh was a member of the Board of Trustees of the American Council on Education and a former president of the Association of American Colleges. At present, Hesburgh is a director of the Institute of International Education, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, and the Freedom Foundation. He is also a member of the Board of Trustees at the Chase Manhattan Bank.

The list of awards which Hesburgh has received is long and varied. Heading the list are the Meiklejohn Award of the American Association of University Professors, the Clark Kerr Award of the Academic Senate of the University of California at Berkeley, and the Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor, bestowed on him in 1964 by President Lyndon B. Johnson. More than 40 colleges and universities have conferred honorary degrees on Father Hesburgh as Davidson will do this spring.

“The degree will be symbolic of the desire for Christian unity between Catholics and Christians. It will represent a new age which has come,” said College President Samuel R. Spencer Jr.

The topic of Hesburgh’s address is unknown at this time, but Spencer ventured to say that the topic could be education, a field in which Hesburgh has played a large role. According to Hesburgh, a great college or university “should be a community of scholars, learning and teaching and at the service of mankind’s total development in our day. It should be a place where all the great questions are asked, where the mind constantly grows as the values and powers of intelligence and wisdom are cherished and exercised in full freedom.”

Along with Hesburgh, there will be the normal recognition of outstanding individual achievements by the presentation of awards. However, two awards will be added. The Thomas Jefferson Award will go to the freshman with the highest academic average, while the Jefferson Davis Award will be presented to the student who demonstrates the keenest interest in constitutional law.

The Davidson College Psychology department will extend its summer internship program at Broughton Hospital in Morganton into the fall term of the coming school year.

The summer program has been in operation for five years. Professor of Psychology William G. Workman describes the program as “highly structured.” Each student takes two courses: Classroom Abnormal Psychology and Advanced Abnormal Psychology. The latter will be expanded this year to include more than mere textbook work involving...### Outside Perspectives

#### USC expects raised standards
The University of South Carolina is facing budget restrictions and expects to be forced to raise admission standards. Required total scores on the Scholastic Aptitude Test are expected to be raised to 800 (out of 1600) in all colleges of the university except the College of General Studies, which would raise its standards to 650.

#### Ford allows CIA-School contracts
President Gerald R. Ford has permitted the Central Intelligence Agency (C.I.A.) to enter into research contracts with universities provided the school’s top officials know where the funds are coming from. The permission was granted in an executive order issued in February. In 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson had barred any C.I.A. secret funding of educational institutions. Johnson barred the agency from such contracts after it was revealed that the C.I.A. had secretly funded the U.S. National Student Association and other groups. The Ford order allows contracts for “classified or unclassified research...provided the C.I.A. sponsorship is known to the appropriate senior officials of the academic institution.”

#### Emory bans obscene flick
An Emory University showing of the film “The Devil in Miss Jones” was recently canceled due to an objection to the showing by the dean for student activities. The dean reported that he had contacted state and county legal authorities in order to find out if the film was obscene. The state attorney general’s office replied that “it was explicitly obscene.” The dean then urged cancellation of the film, saying he feared a police raid if the film was shown.

#### Clemson women invoke Title IX
Residents of five women’s dormitories at Clemson University recently voted to abolish the “sign-in, sign-out” policy which the university has imposed on its women dormitory students. The students used Title IX of the Education Amendments Act to force the vote. Clemson has a policy of requiring women dormitory students to sign-in and sign-out all male visitors to the dorm. The university has no such policy for men.

#### Psychology adds internship, Broughton fall term planned
Students participating in this year’s summer program will actually live at the hospital for eight weeks. Week one will entail orientation to the hospital, group interaction, lectures, and discussions. The next six weeks will be spent in actual contact with the patients in a working situation. Each student will work under supervision as an aide for twenty or twenty-five hours per week. According to Workman, each student will do exactly what a regular employee does. This may involve bathing, feeding, or taking a patient into town. Workman emphasized that these actions bring the students into the most direct relationship with the patient. The entire group will meet four or five times a week, and students will have occasional conferences with the professor. Students will also be participating observers in therapy groups conducted by a member of the professional staff. The final week will be devoted to more academic work. Students will submit a summary of their daily journals, with special emphasis on suggested improvements in both the hospital and the program. A term paper will also be required. Last year twenty students from Davidson and other colleges participated in the summer program. The fall program will proceed much as the summer one will, with few changes. Emphasis will still be placed on direct contact with patients and participation in ongoing therapy.
