10 The Davidsonian

The Davidson field hockey team played back-to-back games against Radford this week. The ’Cats competed in the first match on
Wednesday night, Oct. 11, on the rain-drenched Belk Turf Field, and played the second game away at Radford on Saturday,
Oct. 17. Unfortunately, the Radford Highlanders defeated the ’Cats in both games 3-1 and 4-0.

In the first game of the series, Davidson put up a tough fight and did not allow the Highlanders to
walk away with a shutout. Megan Lenhardt of Radford scored the first goal of the match off a penalty corner
in the first 10 minutes; then shortly after, Highlander Kay Tufts scored again, giving them a 2-0 lead.

The ’Cats came back strong in the second half, when Finley Amato '13 scored in the first five minutes for
her fourth goal of the season. Unfortunately, Davidson was unable to even the score, and Radford scored again off a
penalty corner early in the second half, giving them a 3-1 lead. The Highlanders outshot the Wildcats 23-12.

For the second game of the series, the Wildcats traveled to Radford for a weekend match. The team hoped for
a win, but again fell short with a 4-0 loss.

Davidson started out strong with multiple shots on goal within the first 10 minutes, but after a wide shot by
Amato, Radford’s Madonna Wadolowski scored the first goal of the match.

Radford sweeps NorPac series with Wildcats

Finley Amato ’13 battles for the ball during the Wildcats’ 3-1 loss to Radford last week. Amato scored her team-leading
fourth goal of the season in the game.

After another series of tough play by the ’Cats, they were still unable to find the back of the net,
and Jennifer Balka of Radford scored with ten minutes left in the half. Radford’s Melissa Register followed shortly with a
goal of her own.

Radford finished the first half with a 3-0 lead. Again Davidson played hard in the second half, but was unable
to break the Radford shutout. The Highlanders scored again in the final five minutes of the game to bring the
score to 4-0.

The Wildcats now stand 4-11 overall and 0-4 in the NorPac East. They will compete at home against Appalachian State
(NorPac) at 12 p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 24.

’Cats, from page 12

The teams would exchange a total of 16 shots, five of which were on goal. Only one mattered. In the
52nd minute, just as the second half reached full speed, Callan Elswick ’11 streaked down the sideline, eyeing crossing opportunities
in the box. She targeted in Bye-Nagel, who redirected Elswick’s arching pass into the back of the net.

The minutes following the go-ahead goal witnessed 11 shots and 4 corner kicks, but neither team could tilt the balance
either way. With their second 1-0 shutout in four games, the ’Cats had earned a 5-3 record in the competitive
Southern Conference. That win-loss ratio places Davidson fifth in the SoCon standings. The ’Cats are now looking to make the
conference tournament, as four teams qualify.

This weekend’s games against Chattanooga and Samford will prove decisive in the team’s final SoCon run. Both will take place
away from the friendly confines of Alumni Stadium, but the ’Cats stand poised to eat away at their small deficit
and earn a treasured place in November competition.
