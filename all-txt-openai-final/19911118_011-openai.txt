Davidsonian Picks Wildcats To Finish First in Big South

By Bruce Balestier & Robert Grubb

After suffering through a dreadful 4-24 season in his initial year at the helm of the Davidson basketball program two
years ago, head coach Bob McKillop parlayed an infusion of young talent into a 10-19 record last year. That season
ended with a surge of momentum, as the youthful Wildcats (the team started four freshmen and a sophomore) won three
of their last four games and nearly knocked off eventual champion Coastal Carolina in the semi-finals of the Big South
Tournament.

Despite losing starting strong forward James Marsh (he returned to Germany), this year’s team returns four starters, and has experience
at all five positions. If the team comes together, this should be the breakthrough year for the program.

The point guard position is locked up by incumbent Pat Holloway. Holloway, a 6’1" sophomore, is lightning-quick with the basketball,
and arguably the finest athlete in the league. Last year was a learning year for Holloway; he averaged 9 points
per game, but hurt the team’s chances with a 3 to 1 turnover to assist ratio. This year, however, Holloway
returns to Davidson a different player; an improved jump shot, with range to the three-point line, and more mature decision-making
should make Holloway a steady leader at the point.

Holloway will receive help at the point from starting off-guard Jason Zimmerman and senior captain Paul Denmond, both of whom
saw time there last season. In addition, 6’3" freshman Frank Harris, from New York City, is a fast, flashy player
who could see time there as well.

Zimmerman returns at the two-guard slot after a fine freshman season. He led the team with 12.5 points per game
and was one of the finest free-throw shooters in the nation. His .863 percentage at the line ranked him 13th
in the nation and was best among freshmen. Zimmerman ranked second in the Big South in 3-point field goal percentage
a year ago and is a constant threat from three-point range. If the Wildcats can get consistent offensive output at
both the big forward and center spot, Zimmerman could punish defenses by knocking down the open perimeter jump shot.

Denmond is likely to be the team’s sixth man. After averaging 13.4 points per game as a sophomore, Denmond tailed
off last year, contributing 7.3 ppg. He is an extremely talented offensive player who is capable both of penetrating to
the basket and hitting the outside shot, but was often reluctant last year to take the initiative in games. Denmond’s
experience gives the Wildcats a steadying influence off the bench at guard. Co-captain Sterling Freeman is a defensive specialist who
started 26 games over his first three years; he will also provide leadership in the backcourt.

Presently, sophomore Janko Narat seems likely to start again at the small forward position. Though hampered by a lack of
defensive quickness, the 6’6" Narat is a talented scorer. Last year he averaged 8.3 points and 4.4 rebounds per game,
but sometimes made poor decisions on the court. His shot selection and free-throw shooting (66% last year) both seem to
be improved so far this season. If Narat can make the open three-pointer (he shot just 28% on three-pointers last
season), the ‘Cats will have three viable three-point shooters in the starting five.

6’6" sophomore Scott Alford may also see time at the 3-spot, but could also play the other frontcourt positions. He
scored 22 points in his debut last year against Central Connecticut, and played in the ‘Cats’ first nine games, but
missed most of the remainder of the year after dislocating his kneecap. Alford is likely the best perimeter shooter on
the team and his great ball-handling ability for his size presents matchup problems for opposing defenses.

Fellow 6’6" sophomore Ronald Horton also lends the team versatility at the 3 and 4 spots. Horton is less effective
than Alford from the outside, but also handles the ball well. His 1990-91 campaign was also abbreviated by injury; after
playing in the first seven games, he missed the rest of the year with a knee injury.

The biggest question mark for the Wildcats is at the power forward position. Marsh, last year’s starter, offset his offensive
shortcomings with fine defense and rebounding. He led Davidson with 6.2 boards per game. 6’8" senior co-captain Paul Drobnitchis a
similar player. While his offensive skills are limited, he is a consummate defender and rebounder. Drobnitch got the start last
Saturday in the ‘Cats’ first exhibition against Cherry Point, but will likely see reduced playing time as freshman George Spain
gains experience.

Spain, a widebody at 6’7" and 235 pounds, contributed 12 points, 9 rebounds, and 4 blocks a game as a
senior at Spring Valley High School in Columbia, S.C. His shooting percentage was an exceptional 68%. Spain has been a
pleasant surprise in the first month of practice. He has been aggressive at both ends of the floor and excelled
in the first Red-Black scrimmage, pouring in 18 points on 8-11 shooting from the floor. Spain will also see time
behind Detlef Musch at See "Team Outlook" on page 12.

Cats to Fight Coastal, Radford For The Conference Crown
By Bruce Balestier & Robert Grubb

Here is a look at the Wildcats’ competition in Big South play this year:

RADFORD
Junior Doug Day, the leading scorer in the Big South at 20.2 ppg last year, heads a list of 4
returning starters for the Highlanders. Day is a phenomenal outside shooter (he ranked third in the nation with 3.7 three-pointers
per game last season) who has spells where he simply cannot miss. Davidson found this out the hard way last
January in Radford, when Day’s 30 points (7-11 three-pointers) led the Highlanders to a 78-72 win. Radford’s primary challenge will
be to replace graduated All-Big South center Ron Shelburne (13.7 ppg), the school’s all-time leading scorer. 6’6" senior Pete Reece
is expected to take Shelburne’s spot in the starting five. 6’2" transfer guard Brian Schmall, who averaged 15 points a
game for former Big South member Augusta last year, also should contribute.

COASTAL CAROLINA
The Chants made the nation aware for the first time of the Big South last March when they scared Indiana
in a first-round NCAA game, trailing by three with two minutes left, and losing by just ten. That team raced
through the conference with a 13-1 mark and finished 24-8. Forward Tony Dunkin, the Big South player of the year
in each of his first two years, returns, but without three of his teammates. Center DuWayne Cheatam, off-guard Brian Penny,
and point guard Robert Dowdell all graduated, removing 40 points and 16 rebounds per game from the team in the
process. Senior J.J. Foster (3.5 ppg) is a question mark at the point, and the only other returning starter is
forward Eddie Lesaine (6.8 ppg). Coastal apparently parlayed their tournament success into the finest recruiting class in the conference. Dennis
Pierre, a 6’7" transfer from Cincinnati, might contribute immediately in the post.

CAMPBELL
The Camels played their way to a last-place Big South finish (3-11, 9-19) last year, but lost two-thirds of their
starting frontcourt before the first game. 6’6" junior forward Mark Mocnik (a team-high 13.5 ppg in 1990) and 6’7" sophomore
forward Billy Ellison each return after missing the entire 1990-91 season with injuries. See "Big South” on page 12.
