**Wildcat Ten Drop Two, Win One**

By SCOTT BEAVER ’84

The Wildcat wrestlers went 1-2 this past week, competing in a four-team tournament against Pfeiffer, Lynchburg, and Livingstone. Davidson outpointed
Pfeiffer, 32-17, but fell to Lynchburg 29-19, and to Livingstone, 37-12.

In the loss to Lynchburg, Davidson got victories from junior John Breidenstine (142), who decisioned Brian Rowe 8-5; sophomore Bob
McCullen (167), who pinned Pete Brothers at 1:45; and junior Tom Hissom (177), who claimed George Johnson 8-0. Lynchburg victories
came at 118, where Stuart Shelton decisioned freshman Jim Labrec 10-2; at 134, where Dave Carlone beat freshman Tom Cardwell
15-2; 150, where Dave O’Homa beat senior Chris Tiernan 13-2. Tiernan’s loss was his first of the season at 158
lbs. Davidson forfeited two weight classes (190 and unlimited) and Lynchburg one (126).

The Wildcats recorded only two wins over Livingstone. Tiernan won a 4-2 decision over Malcolm Pridger, and Hissam decisioned Archie
Kincy 10-3. Livingstone winners were: Kevin Aide (118), Robin Rice (134), Carl Walker, and Larry Hester (167).

In the win against Pfeiffer, Davidson picked up several big wins. Sophomore Tom Oddo (126) pinned John Slaton at 5:24,
and Tiernan pinned John Mokena at :46. Hissam and Pfeiffer’s Ken Budd fought to an 8-8 draw in a grudge
match. Pfeiffer got a pin from Mike Patterson (134), of Cardwell, and a 7-2 Al Baretta decision over Breidenstine.

Davidson’s dual meet record is now 6-6.

A recurring problem for the Wildcats has been the absence of wrestlers at the 190 lb. and heavyweight divisions. The
Wildcats always have to go into a dual meet having already given up twelve points. The significant number of freshmen
wrestling is promising, however, as they are gaining college experience in their first year.

Another positive development has been the performance of wrestlers who have changed weight classes during the year. Oddo dropped from
134, in which he was 6-3, to 126, in which he is 7-0. Tiernan, who was only 1-5 at 167,
is 10-2 at 158.

The first three times they pressed us. This time we handled it well. I think they were counting on it
to shake us up, but we were ready for it.”

In fact, the Lady Cats really turned the table on the Cobras as they put a press of their own
on right before the half. It resulted in a number of Coker turnovers, which the team converted to points right
before the half. Mayes added, “I was really happy that everybody got a chance to play and did a super
job. The level of play didn’t go down at all when I took the starters out. Coker was still playing
a tough defense, but we kept running the plays and getting the rebounds right until the end.

“I’ve been really impressed with the play of Cathy Morell in the past few games,” Mayes continued. “She’s really been
able to spark the team.” Against Greensboro on Saturday, Morell managed 4 points and 4 rebounds in only six minutes.
On Tuesday she was impressive under the boards, as she pulled in 9 rebounds in less than 20 minutes of
court time. A new addition to the team, senior Laura Terry (who joined the Lady Cats after Christmas) also did
an excellent job of coming off the bench. She grabbed 5 rebounds and scored 2 points in six minutes.

Mayes concluded by saying, “I’m really excited about the rest of the season. We’re playing some tough schools but I’m
confident that we can beat anybody on our schedule.”

The Lady Cats will try to do just that as they play Catawba tonight at 7 p.m. and Wofford tomorrow
at 2 p.m. Both games are in Johnston Gym.
