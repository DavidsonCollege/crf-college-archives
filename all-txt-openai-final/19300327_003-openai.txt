- THE DAVIDSONIAN, MARCH 27, 1930

### Side Line Shots At a Typical Wildcat Fight Against Odds
By P. R. Alderman

It would take a dyed-in-the-wool pessimist to complain about the Wildcat nine that Coach Monk presented against Georgetown in the season’s opener last Thursday. They’re good and have the fight too! The four pitchers, with the exception of Captain Kugler, started out in midseason form. The 'Cats’ leader seemed to have started off on the wrong foot but will undoubtedly come back to match his last year’s performances.

“Lefty” Thompson, the sole left-hander that Davidson can boast, went great to pull the Cats out of a bad hole in the Georgetown game. His slow ball had the visiting batsmen finding nothing but air with their bats most of the time.

To further brighten battery prospects, “Doc” Henderson completely bewildered the Hilltoppers with plenty of curves and then clinched the game with a hefty blow that was good for two bases. John McInnis proved a match for one of Davidson’s strongest diamond foes, the Oak Ridge Cadets, twirling an airtight game but being deprived of victory by untimely miscues on the part of his teammates.

“Sleepy” Goodson shows very evident signs of being the ’Cats’ leading slugger this year, starting the season off with a triple and two singles out of four times up. His fielding speaks for itself. “Red” Parish demonstrated the fact that it doesn’t take size to sock the old apple for a circuit clout. His home run blow was the only thing that saved the Wildcats from a shutout at the hands of Oak Ridge.

One outfielder’s post and shortstop are the weak points that Coach Monk will have to bother about for the next few days. There’s good material for both positions but experience is needed more than anything else before some costly errors will be eliminated. Jim Proctor had a bad break that kept him from starting in the opener but should be ready to do his part of the hitting before long. “Happy” Gladstone took his place on first base and made a good job of it although he is regularly at home behind the bat.

The impression given in the opening game, at least in the first part of it, was that Davidson was going to be weak at the bat this spring. However, the nine took big steps toward removing this feeling in the latter part of the game. With the experience of several games to give the members of the team what is lacking in the way of coordination as a nine, the Wildcats will have a clear road for a victorious season. For, with a little more poise, there is nothing to prohibit such. This does not mean that some hard foes won't be met but the fact that a nine as good as the Georgetown University put up was defeated is convincing evidence that there will be no foe on Davidson's schedule which will prove undefeatable.

### Wildcats Open Baseball Season With A 7-6 Win Over Georgetown’s Nine
Hilltoppers Get Fast Start to Lead For Six Innings Before Pitcher Weakens

The Davidson Wildcats opened the 1930 baseball season with a thrilling win over the Hilltoppers of Georgetown University, an extra inning being required before the Wildcats could claim a 7 to 6 verdict. “Doc” Henderson, who had been sent into the pitching box for the ’Cats in the seventh, after his teammates had tallied four times leaving them only one run behind the visitors, pitched shut-out ball for four innings. This same man brought across the winning run in the tenth, when “Red” Parish singled with the bases loaded to drive “Doc” home.

With the game half over, it looked as if it was going to be all Georgetown. The visitors started fast, and when the Davidson half of the sixth inning rolled around, the visitors were coasting along nicely, leading 6 to 1. Poole, the visitors’ moundsman who had pitched nice ball for five innings, weakened at this point, and before relief could be sent in, the ’Cats had tallied four more runs, to shorten the margin to one run. In the ninth, the Wildcats tied the count when Goodson tripled into right, stepping across the plate when McInnis duplicated his slugging with another triple.to left center. In the tenth, after Henderson had sent the visitors back to their benches with no runs or hits, he started the ball rolling with a scorching double. Armfield took his base when hit by a pitched ball. Both advanced when Morris miscued McMillan’s bunt to the pitcher. With the bases loaded, Red Parish sent a hard single between second and short, sending in Henderson with the winning run.

For the visitors, McCarthy looked especially good, slamming out a triple, double, and a single in five trips. Aside from the playing of Henderson, Goodson was the hitting star for the 'Cats, garnering a triple and two singles in four attempts.

SPRINKLE YOUR DAY WITH CAMELS CHEER
Consider the pleasure that curls from each Camel. Let it mark the stops and turns of a busy day and sprinkle your thoughts and moods with its rare aroma. As you pass from one thing to another, call “time out” now and then for a fragrant interlude and have a Camel just because it’s good!

Always count on Camels for an extra measure of pleasure. They never tire your taste nor leave an unpleasant aftertaste. To have a Camel “just because it’s good” means you’ll find each Camel cool and refreshing... mild and mellow... blended from the choicest tobaccos grown.
