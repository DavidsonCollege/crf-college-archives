__THE DAVIDSONIAN__

**Life Is A Dream more entertaining than moving**

With scurrying movements across the stage, random combat fighting, and crazy lighting cues, the well-rehearsed actors never falter lines; the
costumes function appropriately; the choreography and blocking work very nicely. But it just did not move me.

**The Davidsonian Editorial**

Shattering the proverbial notion that this campus is shielded by an all-encompassing bubble, the men and women of Davidson College
will Take Back the Night this evening. These students will confront the frightening notion that instances of rape and sexual
misconduct are a reality on every college campus across the nation. They will step up to a microphone and, before
their classmates and professors, speak about personal encounters with rape and sexual assault. Their testimony will serve as a startling
reminder that this campus is not immune from the tragedy of sexual assault. It will remind us that, according to
many sources, 1 in 4 women will fall victim to sexual assault by the time they earn their diploma. And
it will remind us that we must maintain a heightened awareness toward sexual misconduct—not just on “Take Back the Night”
week.

The Annual Security Report in Davidson College’s 1997-98 Red Book proclaims that not a single rape—nor forcible sex offense—was reported
to campus or town police dating all the way back to 1993. These statistics would be delightful, if only they
weren't so transparent. Only the most naive could be deluded into believing that Davidson is free from any threat of
sexual assault. The testimony to be offered at “Take Back the Night” tonight will serve as an irrefutable reminder that
we must constantly address issues of rape and sexual assault. We hope that the courage displayed by those who speak
tonight will inspire and...

Thrilling sword fights, a prince undisguised, and all for five dollars at Hodson Hall! Well, kind of. Life Is A
Dream opens. The play has been adapted into a more entertaining spectacle, and I certainly enjoyed my two hours. (I’m
not sure how much a morality play can be adapted to our modern short attention spans). The work is pre-Shakespeare,
and although the narrator, Clarion, is witty, the work lacks the depth and the quickness of Shakespearean drama. The strong
plot competes with over-simplified symbols of good and evil. Combat fighting adds to the excitement of the play; at first
I thought, “Whoa, this could replace kickboxing classes at Baker.” Unfortunately, the sequences were simplistic, cheesy, and short. The only
cool fighting was between the protagonist Segismundo and his first cousin Astolfo.

It is too much to ask James Flieder, Segismundo, to carry the weight of the whole play, although he gives
it his best shot, especially shining in his soliloquies. Other standouts were Eric Brown, perfect for his role as Duke
Astolfo, and Shaheen Counts. Flieder and Counts are the only actors who exhibit passion or sincere feeling. Drawing on my
limited knowledge of morality plays, movement and the symbolic representation of plot is important. The eagle dancer, however, was pretty
ground-bound, and the carefully planned choreography was boring. The highlight was the Devil Dancer, who hysterically had only one evil
pose and one leg movement, but she sure nailed them every time. Symbols were successfully incorporated, however, in a central
orb that dominated the set; this circle glowed red, blue, filled with astrological signs, and silhouetted characters. The inventive leather
lattices on the perimeter of the stage were scarcely used; like the missing energy, the set design was good, just
not stretched to its full advantage. I felt the most sorry for Tamara Ruppart, who was trapped under an ornamental...headpiece
that indeed looked like the ornaments hidden on the backside of the Christmas tree. Inside the headpiece was a microphone
that did not allow Ruppart to inflect her kingly lines. Although her wise words sounded like Yoda, the unnatural amplification
made Ruppart sound (and look) more like “Spaceballs” Dark Helmet. Topped with orange maribou straight off of Sesame Street, this
costuming idea did not work. Yikes. All that said, I had a good time. I laughed with Clarion, shivered for
Segismundo, questioned King Basilio’s motives, and applauded the neat dénouement. The play seemed like an exercise, though, and that is
why James Flieder’s talent and impassioned performance stood out all the more. The play wanted to have fun; the script
begged the actors to climb on the lattices, glow in front of the orb, and drown out the (overly loud)
accompaniment. I think the music had more fun than the actors did, and it was taped.

Entrapment

“Aaaah.” I blink my eyes as the sun streams through the tired shades and realize to myself that a new
day has begun. It is bound to be full of fresh and exciting possibilities and wacky new adventures. Who knows?
Perhaps today I will find an old map in a bottle and follow it to hidden treasure with my off-the-wall,
yet predictable comrades. Or, maybe, I will come up with a plan to serve free pancakes laced with a mind-controlling
substance only to be foiled by my goofy and insane friend who speaks more words in gibberish than he does
in English. And maybe, just maybe, I will be lucky enough to be approached by a distressed (and very attractive)
young lady who has some puzzling mystery regarding the disappearance of her father that no one else can solve... mobilize
the greater campus population to embrace this cause each and every day of the year.

But, let’s be serious... Today I am going to rise up, leave my warm and protective fleece bed, and face
this harsh world. Or, am I? You see I have a rather large dilemma. Do I, like a good and
responsible college student, do my work and then go to class prepared and awake? Or do I, like so many
of my hall mates, plunk my tired behind in the chair at my desk and turn on the computer? The
answer should be evident. Whether it is the nagging influence of my beloved parents, the realization that midterms are less
than a week away, or the fact that I have been told (upon numerous occasions by numerous professors) that there
is a direct correlation between studying and grades, I know what it is I have to do. I know what
you are thinking... You are thinking, "Just turn on the computer!" Well, you are wrong!!! HA! OK, who am I
kidding? You were right... Instead, I turn on that vile computer and allow myself to become possessed with the all-exciting...
Oh, what am I to do? Save me.
