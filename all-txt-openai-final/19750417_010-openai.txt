Minor sports need aid

Right now, students and ad-
ministrators are primarily
concerned with either wrap-
ping things up for a year, or
getting ready for next year’s
onslaught of freshmen.

Priority seems to have been
placed on the housing problem.
While this is indeed a crisis,
there are many other facility
problems which this college

faces, and one of them is
athletics. Minor sports are in a boom
period. Soccer, tennis, and
swimming are all expanding
their schedules, and attracting
players to come to this oasis in
Appalachia.

There has been a great deal
of talk about rejuvenating the
varsity sports. Basketball has
intensified its recruiting
program. It has also developed
a demanding schedule against
many of the country’s top
teams in the hopes of drawing
high-quality prospects to play
for Davidson.

Although football can no
longer give scholarships based
solely on athletic ability, a new
image and coaching staff is at-
tempting to make Davidson a
contender against teams of
comparable size.

Cats hold number three spot,
Still keep NCAA possibility

The Davidson baseball
team’s bid for a conference
championship was placed in
jeopardy this past week as the
Wildcats managed only one win
in three conference games.

The Davidson nine also drop-
ped two non-conference
decisions, and their overall
record fell to 14-12. Their con-
ference record now stands at
7-4.

The week opened April 9 with
Davidson traveling to
Charleston, S.C. for a big game
with league-leading Citadel.
Joel Tew pitched a typically
fine game for the Wildcats as
he held the Citadel to just two
runs.

Unfortunately for Davidson,
it was 2 runs too many as the
Wildcats failed to score against
3 different pitchers. Only
George Weicker, who was 2 for
4, posed any offensive threat as
the Wildcats were shut out for
the second straight game.

On Friday, April 11, David-
son got the hitting it needed as
they racked up 10 runs against
visiting Pfeiffer. Pfeiffer,
however, got 11.

Neither starter Joe Duncan
nor reliever Dwight Plemmons,
whose record dropped to 2-3,
could stop the onslaught as
Pfeiffer pounded out 15 hits, the
most collected by an opponent
all year.

On the brighter side, Mark
Rodgman was 3-5 in boosting
his average to .320 while
Weicker also collected three
hits, including his seventh
home run.

Weicker also picked up 3
RBI’s, giving him a league-
leading 32. Ed Willingham also
homered for the Wildcats.

On Saturday the pitching was
better but the result wasn’t as
Guilford defeated Davidson 5-2.

Tim Peck was nailed with his
fourth loss as Davidson hitters
were again throttled.

Exceptions were Gary
Pomeroy, who singled,
doubled, and drilled his fourth
home run, and Weicker who
was 2 for 3.

Davidson traveled to
Virginia on Tuesday the 15th
for a crucial doubleheader with
conference rival Richmond.
Davidson won the first game 5-
3, but their hopes for a sweep
were dashed in the second
game as the Wildcats were
trounced 8-0.

In the opener, Davidson got
all the runs they needed in the
first inning as the first four bat-
ters scored. The big hit was
Weicker’s bases-loaded double.

Tim Barr then held Rich-
mond to just six hits en route to
his fifth win in 6 decisions.

The second game was simply
disastrous. Joel Tew, who spor-
ted a 1.70 ERA going into the
game, displayed none of his
usual effectiveness and the
Davidson offense was equally
unspectacular. The result was
an 8-0 loss that crippled David-
son’s chances for a conference
title.

The Wildcat conference
record of 7-4 is good enough for
third place behind 6-1 Cita-
del and 8-3 Furman.

Mathematically, Davidson is
still very much in the running
for the conference cham-
pionship which would give
them a berth in the NCAA
playoffs.

The Wildcats will play
Catawba on Thursday, then
battle Furman at 2 p.m. on
Saturday in a crucial con-
ference game.

On Monday they travel to
Pfeiffer, then play at South
Carolina on Tuesday, April 22.
