**Student Health Center Built; College Community Vexed**

*Christopher Smart*

After years of incomprehensive, crowded, and frankly, sorry medical care at the infirmary on Concord Road, Davidson College has made
an about-face with the construction of the new Student Health Center on Glasgow Street. Lying directly across from Smith House,
the new medical center, according to College physician Karl Barkley, is built on a three-pronged premise: “Bigger waiting rooms, more
People magazines, faster virus diagnoses.”

“Let’s face it. What do Davidson students get around here? I don’t see anybody contracting malaria, for God’s sake. They
get little viruses and colds and stuff. We want students to be able to come in, take their Drixoral, and
get the hell out. Simple as that,” Barkley blustered. He went on to say: “If there’s anything I hate it’s
these whiny little rich kids claiming some kind of rare tropical fever when all they are is hung over. Let
me tell you something, kid. I was getting rare tropical diseases in ‘Nam before you were old enough to spell
TB, so don’t give me any crap about your exotic disorders. That is not what the new Student Health Center
is all about. As I said before: bigger waiting rooms, more People magazines, faster virus diagnoses.”

Student reaction to the doctor’s comments has been mixed thus far. Former SGA president Cammie Covington said: “Yeah, well, we
passed a resolution approving this center last fall. I really think that’s what set it in motion. The SGA is
such a powerful tool if you think it matters.”

The Select Committee on Whatever We Want announced today that it had found the Kappa Sigma fraternity guilty on all
counts of drug trafficking. Several days ago, after investigating the house’s suspicious display of used kegs on its porch, detectives
discovered completely functional drug production devices in the basement. At first, they thought it was only a vanity thing. You
know, ‘Look how much beer we can drink.’ But then, while routinely checking up on the fraternity, we realized they
wouldn’t let us into the basement,” said head investigator Russell Snapp. Evidently, the squids had been producing crack cocaine and
LSD in their basement. It is also rumored they have a Big Screen Room.

The students just know how to use it. A really powerful tool. What a tool it is.” Athletic department officials
were not so pleased, however. Apparently, the cost of the new infirmary has put a serious dent in the athletic
budget for next year. Speaking on condition of anonymity, the source said: “How’s Azzo gonna hit all his dingers next
year if we can’t keep him comfortable with all the Twinkies he can eat? Maybe you don’t realize it but
they’re gonna be the first things to go if they build that namby-pamby medical thing. This thing has got to
be stopped.” After further explanation, though, the source seemed to reconcile himself to the inevitable, which is a glorious shrine
to medical practice as we know it in the twentieth century.

Rumored they may have been the driving force behind the SAE scandal. According to sources deep inside the house, Robert
Lloyd-Still, commonly known as “The Sipper,” arranged the entire episode through a series of well-placed bribes in order to stall
aggressive law enforcement agents. The connection is still being investigated. The court case lasted only several hours. It was revealed
that the apparently empty kegs had been used to distribute the drugs, which were then sold on the street by
members of F.L.A.G. attempting to fund their new charter. The total street value of the drugs was sixteen million dollars,
which raised the question presented by the prosecutor, John Howell, “Why don’t they have more parties?” The Honor Council passed
its recommendation to the administration at noon, and the residing judge, Dr. John Kuykendall, named the sentence at one p.m.
The Kappa Sigs were given a one-week probation, told they had to clean up the president’s house, and promised the
school’s full cooperation in the state’s suit against the fraternity. Kuykendall was heard to say later, “They have dry rush
so we let them off easy.”

more appealing than working in the leasing department for a guy named Scooter for the rest of your life? We
are disturbed that the words mentioned in the first paragraph are becoming more common in the conversations about Davidson students.
Wake up! You people aren’t stupid. Good behavior in college will get you NOWHERE. You might as well do whatever
you want to while you can still do it on someone else’s money. None of you are going to get
jobs anyway.
