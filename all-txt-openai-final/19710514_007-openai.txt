The Davidson baseball team, reeling in the midst of a slump which has seen it lose 13 of its last 17 games, closes out its season tomorrow with a doubleheader against East Carolina here at Davidson.

Coach Tom Stevens named senior Wade Shepherd and junior Rick Pipan as the probable pitchers for the Wildcats. The team is tied for fifth in the conference with E.C.U. going into these final two games.

Coach Stevens attributed the slump to an occasional lapse in the field and, most importantly, a 20-point drop in the team batting average, meaning the team is failing to get crucial hits it was getting earlier in the year.

Rick Pipan, the team's junior hurler, has continued to pitch well but the runs have been lacking. He has lost five of his last seven decisions. Among these are included a 2-1 loss in twelve innings at William and Mary, a 2-0 loss last Saturday against The Citadel, and a 3-2 game Tuesday to Furman.

Stevens also said the team dropped three straight to Duke because of errors. Stevens could not explain why the slump has lasted so long except to say, "It's just one of those mental things. The boys seem to be beginning to press too hard now."

The slump has wiped out hopes for a top spot in the Southern Conference, for which the 'Cats still had a great chance until last Saturday. They were 6-4, but the double losses at the hands of Furman and The Citadel did them in.

**Stavrides Leads Group In Practice Of Karate**

Every week, fifteen people practice the Shorin-Ryu Okinawan style at Johnson Gym, which has become the dojo. No, no subversive activity is going on. Pete Stavrides, a sophomore from Long Island and a Black Belt, teaches a karate school ("dojo") on the handball courts as a part of the Free University program each week.

The class has been taught for one year, and four students have already completed their requirements for green belts.

**Two Thinclads Place At Duke**

Two Davidson thinclads placed in the North Carolina state track meet held at Duke University last weekend. Steve Kirley took a third place in the shot put competition. Ray Swetenburg placed in two events, taking a third in the triple jump and a fifth in the high hurdles.

According to track coach Sterling Martin, Swetenburg’s qualifying time was among the best of the meet, but he did not fare as well in the competition.

Robert Camp, Bill Alexander, Mike Ernst, and David Meeks have now achieved that rank and merely await the arrival of the belts. Camp and Alexander will teach the karate class next year when Stavrides is studying in France.

Stavrides has five Davidson students and ten townspeople in his class. At each meeting, they go through strenuous exercises and a disciplined format. Stavrides is a traditionalist who believes in teaching the class just as it has been taught for centuries, maintaining the spiritual, philosophical, and aesthetic values that go with such a format.

Stavrides said the primary purpose of karate was to develop a rigorously maintained harmony of mind and body. Stavrides teaches the course on a completely voluntary basis. He gave two reasons for offering the class.

"First," he said, "I want to try to stay in the best shape I possibly can. And second, I feel that a growing, progressing school such as Davidson should offer some martial arts program."

He noted two controversies over the teaching of karate today. First, he pointed to the traditionalism versus the commercialism argument. "Some think karate should be only a sport without the spiritual, philosophical, and aesthetic values which accompany it," Stavrides stated. He teaches his students in the disciplined traditional manner.

He also noted the controversy over whether to "pull the punches" in a class or not. Stavrides does not believe in "holding back," reasoning that when one really has to defend himself in the street, he may "pull his punch" as he has in practice rather than exert 100 percent as he should.

However, apparently Stavrides’ students do not greatly object to his uncompromising pressure and rigorous discipline. Rather, he said, "it has created a devotion to perfection of the art."

Occasionally, a student does get discouraged and wonders if it is all really worth it. When that occurs, Stavrides tells the student what his own "sensei" (teacher), Joseph Johnston, told him when he first began six years ago.

"He told us that nothing in life that is worthwhile comes easily," Stavrides recalled. "Everything good in life is gained through hard work, sacrifice, and perhaps some blood."
