SGA Info Update

By Catherine Turner
September 3rd was only our
second meeting this year and you
would not believe how busy we
are! Of the many issues we dis-
cussed I would like to highlight
four of them.

FRESHMEN!!!! There will be
a Freshman Forum Monday, Sep-
tember 9th at 7 p.m. in the Big
Screen room. This forum will al-
low you to learn about the candi-
dates who are running to represent
you in the SGA. The freshmen
senator elections, along with the
independent elections, are on
Tuesday, September 10th from
9 a.m.-3 p.m. in the Union and the first
floor of Chambers. DON’T FOR-
GET TO VOTE!!!

From the academia- Congratu-
lations to Dr. Klein for being hon-
ored with the prestigious North
Carolina Case Professor of the Year
Award. An issue that will be final-
ized after the faculty meeting is the
calendar for the spring of 1993. If
approved by the faculty, classes
will end on April 20th. Wednes-
day, April 21 through Tuesday,
April 27 would be optional class
days. Reading day would be
Wednesday, April 28 and exams
would be between Thursday the
29th and Tuesday, May 4. Gradu-
ation for the class of 1993 would
be Sunday, May 9. The reason for
this new schedule is to give seniors
more time to take exams.

PARKING! Everyone’s com-
plaining- and rightfully so. The
faculty should be getting more
spaces behind the Gray House, and
a word to students about parking in
faculty spots- DON’T DO IT! As
of now you’ll get a ticket, but we
are working to change this espe-
cially for the faculty spaces near
the library, so that students may
park there at night. One final word
has come to Patterson Court about
parking for the cooks-NO. Ray
Thrower feels that if they give
special parking to the cooks then
everyone else will want it too. The
idea of upperclassmen parking was
presented to Ray Thrower also, but
it was shot down because of the
cost and lack of staff.

Did you know that every
Monday in September at 8 p.m. in
the Conference room there is a
Council on Minority affairs meet-
ing that is open to all? Topics of
discussion include handicapped
students and how Davidson caters
to their needs, an African studies
class counting for cultural diver-
sity and a proposal that Davidson
invite more visiting professors who
specialize in minority affairs.
Seniors, if you’re interested in
knowing if you'll have to pay for
cable that you didn’t have- stay
tuned and read the SGA minutes.
