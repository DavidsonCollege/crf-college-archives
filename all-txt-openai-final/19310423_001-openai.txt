**Installation Exercises of Y.M.C.A. Take Place Sunday Evening April 19**

Dean Rusk, Roger Enloe, and Secretary Carl Pritchett All Make Short Talks

The installation service of the Y. M. C. A. was held last Sunday evening, and proved to be singularly impressive.
The string quartet as a prelude softly played “Angel Gabriel,” and the audience sang in unison several appropriate songs. Dean
Rusk read a passage from the Scriptures and called on Norman Raies and Andy Bird for prayers. Mrs. G. R.
Vowles sang a solo entitled “A Clean Heart.” Dean Rusk, the retiring president, made a short talk on “The Passing
of the Old and a Hope.” The retiring president expressed his gratitude to the cabinet that has upheld him so
faithfully, and brought attention to the successful Barium Springs campaign that the “Y” conducted last year. He also thanked the
friends of the “Y” for their interest and all those who have used their musical talents and helped in other
ways. He declared that the aim of Christ is not in ordinary life, but that everyday life must be raised
up to a level with it. In concluding he made the wish that the new cabinet would co-operate with their
president as well as those who assisted him.

In response, Roger Enloe congratulated Dean Rusk and his cabinet on their record for the past year. He declared that
their achievements would always be an inspiration to him. He stated that the road that lay before him was not
easy, but that children of weakness can accomplish all things if they trust in the Lord. Carl Pritchett, in his
subject, “The Force and the Field,” asserted that the “Y” is the normal spiritual expression of 600 men, a union,
with the purpose of creating a wholesome Christian atmosphere, and to do Christ’s work effectively. He affirmed that the men
assembled here at Davidson are the finest in the South, and added that the sun never sets on Davidson men.
As regards to the field, he declared that its scope was unlimited. He said that he agreed with Vance.

from the Southern trip after being away for a week, and having debated with the University of Florida, at Agnes

were defeated by the University of Florida by a 2-1 score and won a decision over Southwestern by a 1-0
score. There was no decision for the debate at Sewanee, the debate being held solely for pleasure and study of
the question. The Davidson debaters upheld the affirmative in these three debates. The question that was used by this team
and all the others in the different debates was, “Resolved: That the nations of the world should adopt a policy
of free trade.” Another team composed of R. D. Powell.

**Col. Little Inspects Davidson Battalion**

The R. O. T. C. Department of this college had its annual inspection on Tuesday and Wednesday, April 21 and
22, with Col. James M. Little, of Winston-Salem, serving as the inspection officer. The report of Colonel Little will be
filed with the War Department at Washington to determine the rating of the local unit for this year.

Colonel Little is now attached to the 81st Division of the organized reserves, and is with the infantry branch of
the service. During the Mexican disturbance, he was with the 28th Infantry on the Mexican border, and when the United
States entered the World War, Colonel Little was detailed for services overseas. While at Davidson, the visiting inspector was the
guest of Lieut.-Col. W. R. Scott, commandant of the Davidson R. O. T. C. battalion. On Wednesday, Colonel Little was
the guest of honor at a luncheon given to him by the members of Scabbard and Blade, the honorary military
fraternity. For the past three years, Davidson has won an excellent rating from the War Department, and as the report
of this inspection has not been officially announced yet, the results are anticipated with much interest.

**Religious Leader From Cornell Visits Davidson**

Prof. R. H. Edwards, head of the united religious work at Cornell University for the past ten years, was a

Ten years ago, Professor Edwards was assigned the task of directing the work of all the religious faiths at Cornell.

D. G. MARTIN IS ELECTED EDITOR OF DAVIDSONIAN IN RECENT STUDENT VOTING

Professor Rene Hadree From N.C.C.W. Speaks To Students on France

His Lecture, Given Entirely in French, Was Illustrated by Colored Pictures

On last Monday night, Professor Rene Hadree, a professor of French at N.C.C.W. in Greensboro, N.C., spoke to the students
of French at Davidson College. Monsieur Hadree was invited by Le Cercle Francais to speak about his early life in
France. Along this line, he spoke very interestingly and informatively. He was born in Touraine, a beautiful land which he
described to the listeners to help them better understand the life of the inhabitants. Then he told of his school
life. The first school he attended was divided into two parts: one for the girls and one for the boys.
Not only in their recreation but also in their studies, they were segregated. At this school, the chief amusements were
marble shooting, top spinning, and playing “cracking the whip.” From this school, however, he went to a “high school” at
which he did not enjoy himself at all. At this place, he knew no one, and, as he said, it
was a prison to him. However, at the third school, Monsieur Hadree had a very enjoyable time. The chief amusements
here were soccer and Rugby football. After telling of his school life, Monsieur Hadree showed two sets of colored pictures
of French life. The first set consisted of a group of chateaus, about each of which he talked, describing it;
and the second set consisted of pictures of French life.

Week,” according to Professor Ernest J. Cullum, head of the Music Department at Davidson. The local functions will be sponsored

represent their state in a district audition, of which there will be five. From each district, two contestants will be
selected to contest in the national finals to be held in New York in December. All winners of district auditions
will receive substantial rewards. The winners of first place in the national competition, one young man and one young woman,
receive five thousand dollars each and two years’ tuition in an American conservatory. Last year, George Pardington won the North
Carolina competition. Several students have already announced their intention to enter the contest this year.

Dr. Hood and Party Will Travel Abroad

Will Sail from New York on the Steamship “Paris” April 13

On the thirteenth of April, 1931, the steamship “Paris” sails from the harbor of New York, bound for Havre, France.
This marks the beginning of Dr. Hood’s European tour. Dr. and Mrs. Frazer Hood, accompanied by their daughter and Miss
Corinne Wagner, Mrs. Hood’s sister, are planning to spend their summer traveling amid scenes of classical and historical renown. Dr.
Hood and his family, when they land at Havre, will procure an automobile, in which they will tour parts of
France, Germany, and England. They are going to visit for a while a friend of Dr. Hood's, who is a
colonel in the British army. He lives in the town of Grasmere, situated in the famous Lake District of England.
There they will tramp over the spots where Wordsworth, Coleridge, Southey, and the other well-known “Lake Poets” lived, dreamed, and
wrote. They will gaze upon the scenes that enchanted the hearts of those great men and brought forth those verses
we all know, love, and praise.

Dr. Hood is going to return to America during the latter part of July, but the other members of the
party will remain until later on during the summer.
