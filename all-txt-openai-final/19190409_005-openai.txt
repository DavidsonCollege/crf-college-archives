### Battalion Soon to Shine In New Uniforms

**Will Probably Be Issued this Week.**

Several large boxes of uniforms have at last arrived. The question is being asked, “When will the uniforms be issued?” Colonel Mueller says: “The uniforms will be issued as soon as there are essential parts enough for every man.”

The uniforms, overcoats, and shoes are being shipped from the various army posts, some from as far as Chicago. It is not known just what parts of the uniforms are here, but everything is being checked up. In the meantime, shipments are arriving daily and Colonel Mueller assures us that we will certainly be issued uniforms by the last of the week.

There has been a delay in the shipment of rifles due to the confusion in the ordnance department. With thousands of soldiers discharged every day, it seems that it would be an easy matter to send two hundred and fifty rifles. We must take into consideration, however, the enormous amount of work on the War Department at this time and rest assured that the rifles will soon be here.
