Eu Society

There was no regular program at the Eumenean Society Saturday night on account of the election of officers for the second term. J. H. Mauze and Paul C. Menge were received into the society. Dr. W. C. Lindsay made a short talk outlining the importance of the society work and stating the benefits he had received from its membership. C. A. McGirt was elected president and J. C. McCaskill vice-president by a unanimous vote. E. B. McGukin was elected secretary and R. T. L. Liston, reviewer; W. B. Sullivan, valedictorian.

On account of the large membership, the society was divided into two sections, as nearly equal as possible, one section to meet on Saturday night and the other on Monday. The purpose of this division was twofold: first, to allow men to serve on the program more frequently; second, to arouse more interest in the society by having contests between the two sections. There will be one president, but each section will have its own vice-president, reviewer, and secretary. Every six weeks a joint meeting will be held, at which meeting all business will be transacted and a debate held between the two sections.

"Tingua bal Chenesi," said Menge, closing a most eloquent and forceful speech on the affirmative of the debate in which he, speaking in Chinese, opposed W. P. Cumming, negative, speaking in Japanese, on the subject, "Resolved, That China is a greater country than Japan." The house and judges both decided in favor of the affirmative. White criticized the debate in Spanish. Immediately after this pentecostal outbreak, nominations for respondent were declared in order, and Liston, in a speech which, as a gem of political oratory, seemed to equal those of Demosthenes, nominated H. O. Den. He said Den was able to carry out the duties of the office. Gamble, '23, however, moved that Mr. Liston hold a primary (Gamble was the charming host and victim at a murder party after the meeting; funeral services were held from the house at 4 p.m. Sunday). Boulware, leading candidate on the Listonian ticket, was declared elected respondent and the house adjourned.

BIG ISSUE OF MAGAZINE EXPECTED SOON

Boulware and McArn Added to the Staff

The material for the February number of the Magazine has already been sent to the press. This will be one of the largest issues of the year, all departments being well represented. J. R. Boulware and A. D. McArn have been added to the staff and the Magazine feels confident that these new men will add greatly to the life and usefulness of the publication. Boulware will have charge of the cartoons and will aid in the humorous department, while McArn will see to the local news.

It will be of interest to friends to know that Mrs. Lingle has a story in the January issue of the Woman's Home Companion. Rev. J. W. Brown, '12, is doing some graduate work at Princeton Theological Seminary.
