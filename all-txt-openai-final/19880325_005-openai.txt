Dear Confidential Health,
I’ve been trying to lose weight. For some
reason, since I've come to school, I’ve put
on about eight pounds. I’ve started just to
diet and cut out usual searches: Will this
help?

It is never a good idea to cut out a food group
in an effort to lose weight. You’ll be cutting
out necessary nutrients and sacrificing your
health. The best plan is to exercise and eat
a balanced diet.

For weight control you need to take a
good look at your food choices and cut out
unnecessary fats, sugars, and empty calo-
ries.

Fats are often hidden in foods like sauces
and gravies. There are some obvious fats
also, like in butters and meats. Be sure to
trim the fat from your food and choose
leaner types of meats such as chicken,
turkey, and fish.

Sugar is in a surprisingly large number of
foods. You'll have to start reading labels
and looking for ingredients such as corn
syrup, sucrose, glucose, and dextrose.
Cookies, cakes, and pies are obviously
sugar-laden but so are some of the so-called
“health” foods like certain brands of gra-
nola bars.

Good foods to concentrate on include
complex carbohydrates such as pastas,
whole grain breads, and potatoes. These are
wonderful foods to eat and are not “fatten-
ing” in themselves. It is the amount of
sauces, creams, and butter that we add to
them that is unnecessary.

Fruits and vegetables are also good to eat.
There are many nutrients and vitamins
represented in these food groups that
shouldn’t be overlooked. It’s much better
for your body to eat a variety of these foods
than to take a vitamin pill.

Some healthy foods to snack on are fresh
fruits and vegetables, skim or low-fat milk,
whole grain cereals, popcorn (without too
much salt and butter), low-fat cheese and
crackers, a baked potato with broccoli, and
whole grain breads.

Do try to eat more than one large meal at
the end of the day followed by snacking.
Three meals a day with sensible snacks
won’t put weight on you if you make smart
choices.

Exercising can also make a big difference
in helping you to burn up calories and feel
better physically.

Alcohol adds nothing but empty calories.
Not even the dark beers give good nutrients.

The bookstore has many good books on
nutrition. One in particular is Jane Brody’s
Nutrition Book. This is a good time in your
life to establish a healthy eating pattern.

BRIDE, from previous page

he’s hysterical. But, really, it’s a
minor part and kind of toward the
end. Actually, many of the less im-
portant characters are more engag-
ing than Buttercup and Westley (I
mean, let’s be real, we already know
what’s going to happen to them,
right?) The evil Sicilian Vizzini, the
bumbling Fezzig, and the single-
minded Inigo Montoya (a name, I
promise, will become all too famil-
iar) are ultimately more three-di-
mensional than the main characters.

I don’t mean to put down Westley
and Buttercup--hey, it’s true love
after all. So it’s a little sappy, silly,
predictable. It’s arena here or a lot of
fun!

The Princess Bride is playing in
the 900 Room Saturday at 10:00
p.m. Please bring your I.D. and a
dollar if you’re going.
