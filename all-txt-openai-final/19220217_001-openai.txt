Going Good, Team! THeDAVI FOR A BETTER DAVIDSON Come Again, Columbia Vol. IX. DAVIDSON COLLEGE. DAVIDSON, N. C., FEBRUARY 17, 1922. No. 20 Columbia Seminary Quartette and Speakers Spend Week-End on Hill Music Furnished at Chapel, Movies, Church, Volunteer Band, Ministerial Band and “Y”—Searching Talks Made. During the past week-end Davidson had as her guests the Columbia Seminary Quartette, composed of Messrs. Belk, Barber, Batchelor and Yandell, assisted by Messrs. Hay and Beatty. The majority of these men visited Davidson last year, making a profound impression upon the students both by their songs and by their speeches, and it was with the greatest of pleasure that they were welcomed back this year. The quartette, recognized as one of the best college quartettes in the South, furnished music at the chapel exercises Saturday, at the movies Saturday night, at the church services Sunday morning, at the Ministerial Band meeting Sunday afternoon, and at the “Y” meeting Sunday night. While on the Hill these men mingled and talked with the Davidsonians and came to be known by the entire student body. Their songs were heard from time to time during the day, wherever a request was made, but even above this they will be remembered as the Columbia Seminary men who stand for clean, moral, righteous living. The entire party seemed to be perfectly at home while on the campus and were loud in their praise of the Davidson spirit and morale. A short sketch of each of the young men is given below. George W. Belk, Jr., of Hendersonville, N. C., attended Presbyterian College for three years. He is a well-known athlete and played against Davidson in football, baseball and basketball. He made All-State in each of these sports. He is now taking his A.B. and M.A. at the University of South Carolina. He sings first tenor in the quartette. This is his second year at the Seminary. Ernest L. Barber, of Columbia, S. C., is a graduate of Westminster Prep School and of P. C., finishing at the latter institution in 1919. He is now a Senior at the Seminary and fills the pulpit of a church in Edgefield, S. C. He sings baritone in the quartette. Alex. R. Batchelor, of Geneva, N. Y., studied agriculture at Cornell and is a graduate of the Pittsburgh Bible School. After finishing at the latter school he picked out Columbia Seminary as the place to secure his B.D. degree. He is an active Student Volunteer and sings lead in the quartette. B. Frank Yandell graduated from Davidson with the class of '13. He later graduated from Moody Bible School. He supplies at the Wilmore Church, in Charlotte. He sings bass in the quartette. Sam B. Hay, of Allendale, S. C., graduated from Davidson in ’16. During the war he served with the Navy. After securing his discharge he held a position (Continued on page 6) THE WILDCAT SCREAMS “Hurry up, new dormitory. Boys, get out your bats and gloves. Greater Davidson Club is Getting Into Trim to Work Plans for Getting Full Number of Best Men Possible Made. The Greater Davidson Club held its first meeting of the year on last Monday morning in Shearer Hall. Extensive plans were laid for the coming year, which, if matured, will far surpass any in the history of Davidson. Dr. J. M. McConnell opened the meeting with a short history of the club and its work during the last few years. He told how it was organized four years ago with the purpose of perpetuating the ideals and traditions of Davidson and of propagating them throughout the length and breadth of the country. The slogan adopted at that time was, “A Bigger and Better Davidson,” and since then the entire student body and alumni have been working with this sole aim in view and the fruits of their labors can be readily seen. Two years ago the goal of the club was set at five hundred students, and the mark has been attained. Last year three-fourths of the new men who registered were those who had decided to enter Davidson through the activities of the Greater Davidson Club. The mark set by the club was reached last year. For the coming year a new slogan has been adopted, “Five Hundred Again but Quality First.” The present rooming capacity of Davidson does not permit of an increase in numbers, but next year’s Freshman class is to be a selected group. Only those men are to be chosen who are capable of lifting high the ideals of the college and who can reach the scholastic and moral standard set by former student bodies. Dr. McConnell cited several high tributes which were recently paid to the institution by prominent men who are in no way connected with the college and it can be readily seen from the few facts given above that the Greater Davidson Club is reaping a great harvest. Mr. F. L. Jackson next gave, in a few short sentences, the plans which have been made to meet the loss of Chambers. A contract for a new concrete, fire-proof dormitory has been let and it will be ready for occupancy next September. This building is to be four stories high and will furnish rooming space for 180 men. It will be situated on dormitory row just next to Georgia. A new central heating plant is also to be erected. On the 22nd of this month the trustees will meet to discuss funds for several more improvements. The meeting was brought to a close with a few pointed words from Sam Story and Walter Knox, which voiced the sentiment of the entire student body and expressed its determination to make the coming year the best in the history of Davidson. The Davidson High School basketball team played the High School team of Concord in that city last week. The score was 29-13 in favor of Davidson. MILLER AND McKEITHAN TEAM TO DEBATE RANDOLPH-MACON Ogden Chosen Alternate—Places Hotly Contested. Rocking the walls of Old Shearer with eloquence and argument 12 men on the evening of February 13th met in forensic fray, from which were selected Harold McKeithan and P. D. Miller as team mates and Dunbar Ogden as alternate, for the debate with Randolph-Macon, to take place at Peace Institute, in Raleigh, on March 3rd. The question for debate read as follows: “Resolved, That Congress should provide for a department of education under a secretary who shall have those powers and duties set forth in the Smith-Towner Bill.” In the debate with Randolph-Macon, Davidson will uphold the affirmative. State honors, Wildcats Win Three of Last Four Games by Playing in Great Style Victories Over State, Wake Forest, and Trinity, and Loss to Elon, Make Great Record for Team. Coach Hengeveld’s scrappy crew covers itself with honors, setting a six out of eight record. The spectacular pass system that has been drilled as Wildcats featherweights proves effective and the Wildcats crash on toward State Game. Mauze and Crawford continue their praiseworthy work, supported by their “ever-ready” team mates, Dr. Mercer Blaine Shows Views of Hangchow College. The Wildcat five, after losing the first game of the North Carolina trip to Trinity, by the narrow margin of six foul goals, showed the famous Davidson fighting spirit and came back by beating N.C. State on their own court by a score of 25 to 21. The game was playedOn the affirmative were T. A. Taylor, W. W. Moore, Harold McKeithan, J. F. Clark, P. D. Miller, Russell, and W. A. Gamble, while the negative was defended by Rolston Bitzer, Edgar Houghton, Barclay Walthall, Douglas Melver, and Dunbar Ogden. It was especially fortunate that the principals selected will not have to change their debate. The judges for the debate were Drs. Shewmake, Fleagle, and Pettingill, whom the Debating Council was so fortunate as to secure for the three-hour argument. Handing in the decision of the judges, Dr. Shewmake congratulated the debaters as a whole for the class of speeches delivered. 

The preliminaries for the debate with Wake Forest will take place on the evening of March 6th. The finals of the debate will be held in the auditorium of Queens College, at Charlotte, on April 7th. “Resolved, That the Federal Government should own and operate the coal mines of the United States, constitutionality waived,” with Davidson defending the negative.

SEMINARY MEN MAKE STRONG TALKS AT THE “Y” SERVICE

The “Y” vesper service last Sunday was conducted by five students from Columbia Theological Seminary. Messrs. G. W. Belk and A. R. Batchelor gave strong, convincing talks on the subject of complete consecration to Christ. About ninety percent of the students were present. Mr. Belk pleaded the cause of Christ just as if he were a judge, the audience the jury, and Christ on trial. His talk was based on Romans 12:1, “I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.” Christ, to whom all belongs, can take anything except our service, which must be given of our own volition. He asks not only for our hands or our lips, but our all as living sacrifices.

Christ was the most perfect man who ever lived. Yet, from a broken heart, caused by our sins, the most perfect man of history completely gave way under the burden of the cross and died as a propitiation for our sins. The terrible agony that comes through death from a broken heart is inconceivable. Still, Christ underwent that for us, and in return for His sacrifice, He only asks that He be permitted to be the dominant power in our lives. The speaker was not trying to force surrender to His will. No limit can be placed on the value of a surrendered life. Christ gave Himself for you. What will you give for Him?

Interestingly Presented.

Dr. Mercer Blain, of Hangchow College, Hangchow, presented the cause of Christian education in China by means of a stereopticon lecture on last Friday evening. Dr. Blain has been a teacher in the college for a number of years and consequently was fully able to present his subject in an attractive as well as in an instructive way. Doctor Blain opened his address by giving an outline of the school system of China. The Chinese government has its own schools but they are ruled by superstition and tend to make the Chinese mind more closed to the progressive civilization of the outside world. Contrasted with these are the Christian schools which are the greatest hope for China, for these schools not only teach modern science and other branches of learning but they also prepare native Chinese students to be ministers of self-supporting Chinese churches. After this short introduction, Doctor Blain showed a number of stereopticon views which brought out the condition of China in a vivid way. He first showed a view or map of Hangchow, the ancient capital of China. The college is located just outside the city wall and is the only Christian school for millions of Chinese. To illustrate the conditions surrounding the school, views of China were shown presenting some of the most beautiful scenery in the world, together with one of the more ancient wonders of the world, the Great Wall. Temples with their idols and priests were shown. Many of these have huge columns made of pine. Also, the tombs of old Chinese heroes were shown, demonstrating how the Chinese preserve the bodies of their ancestors. In contrast with these were shown some Chinese who have profited by American teachings. Churches, chapels, the Red Cross, and Christian homes were contrasted with heathen institutions. In conclusion, Doctor Blain urged the students of Davidson to do all in their power to help the work and to make Hangchow College the Princeton, Yale, or Harvard of China just as these institutions have their representative colleges over there. Davidson W. I. Knox is in charge of raising this fund and his staff was unusually successful in getting the backing of D. C. students in this worthy cause.

The Ladies’ Auxiliary of the Presbyterian Church has been holding this week a series of prayer meetings for foreign missions. The meetings on Monday and Tuesday were on Latin America and the Orient. On Thursday, two pageants were given on Africa and a self-denial offering was taken.

In the auditorium in Raleigh, Wednesday, February 7th before a crowd of about fifteen hundred people. Excellent passing, fine goal shooting, and close guarding were the deciding factors of the game, the Davidson quint excelling in each one. It was anybody’s game during the first half, each team scoring eight points. At the beginning of the second half, the Davidsonians seemed to take a new lease on life and from then on were never headed. Their most brilliant work came during the middle of the second half when Crawford, Mauze, and Ormond each got a goal in quick succession, giving the Wildcats a six-point lead. The lads from State then rallied and crept up to within two points of Davidson, but a beautiful shot by Mauze and a goal by Ormond put the game on ice. State was without the services of Homewood, star guard, and Long and Johnson were forced to retire from the game on account of injuries. Leiper, a substitute sent in to replace Long, showed more skill in passing and tossing than any of his teammates. He was in the thick of the fray most of the time and tossed in three goals. For Davidson, there were no outstanding stars, the whole team working together with the ease of well-oiled machinery. The Mauze-Crawford combination went like a “house afire” and was responsible for a majority of the Wildcats' points. Price played a beautiful game, breaking up Tech’s passing, besides putting two counters through the hoop. Ormond, Beall, and Mallory at the forward positions were on the hop all of the time, playing the floor and running their guards down.
