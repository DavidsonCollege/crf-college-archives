The Wildcats defeated Elon and UNC-Greensboro in two home games this weekend to bring their record to 3-1 in the
Southern Conference and 5-2 in their last seven matches.

Against Elon University, Davidson achieved a season-high .356 hitting percentage, while the defeat of the Spartans was marked by eight
different Wildcat players making a kill.

Saturday’s match began with a lead by Elon, 9-8, before the ’Cats stepped up with an 11-3 run and went
on to win 30-23. Davidson notched 17 kills.

The second game began with a small 2-0 lead by Elon. The ’Cats and the Phoenix traded points to a
10-all score, but the home team took a stand and after kills by Jenna Dykstra ’07, Kittery Neale ’09, Liz
Williamson ’06, Katie Pierucci ’08, Allison Dwyer ’09, and Tierney Hodge ’09 the score stood at 20-16.

Though Elon crept within one point of Davidson’s lead, three consecutive attack errors by the Phoenix and kills from Williamson,
Pierucci, and Hodge were enough to end the game in favor of Davidson. The score of game two stood at
30-24.

The ’Cats got off to a quick start in the third game with Pierucci and Erin Balak ’06 serving and
rose to 17-8 following a kill from Hodge. Neale finished off Elon with a kill on the last point. Davidson
ended game three with a decisive 30-19 score, and with that the ’Cats took the match 3-0.

Williamson led the Wildcats with 13 kills, while Pierucci followed close behind her with 11. No Phoenix player had greater
than eight kills.

On Sunday, Davidson hosted UNC-Greensboro and won its second match of the weekend. The Wildcats out-hit the Spartans with a
.217 hitting percentage and had leads of greater than 10 points in two of the three games.

The ’Cats ran away with a quick 11-4 lead following a kill by Neale. They continued to score until they
had an 11-point spread at 25-14. From there, kills from Dykstra and Williamson, along with many attacking errors from the
UNC-G squad helped Davidson take game one with a score of 30-19.

The Spartans combined in games one and three for 22 attacking errors, which, added to the high number of kills
for Williamson, caused much of their undoing in the match.

In the second game, Greensboro looked to reverse the advantage and jumped out to an early 12-8 lead. Williamson came
up big for the ’Cats, however, and put away two kills. Dykstra then made a kill and tied the game
at 12-all.

Davidson went on to take the lead, but a bad set from Greensboro allowed the Wildcats to capitalize and win
the game.

#### Play of the Week

**Ben Hoak’s goal against Wofford**

Having lost consecutive games to Old Dominion and Virginia Tech and not having scored in either game, the ’Cats needed
a lift. Ben Hoak ’08 provided that lift in the 64th minute of last Saturday’s game against Wofford when he
broke a 0-0 tie and gave men’s soccer a 1-0 win in their conference opener.

The Drake Bulldogs came into Richardson Stadium for the ’Cats Homecoming game on Saturday and handed Davidson a crushing 58-17
defeat.

The late arriving crowd of over 3,700 fans watched Davidson lead the game 17-7 in the early second quarter before
the Bulldogs ran off 51 consecutive points to bury the ’Cats and give them their third loss of the season.

Davidson received the opening kickoff, but a turnover on its first possession proved costly as Drake connected for an easy
touchdown pass to take a 7-0 lead. The ’Cats quickly answered the Bulldog score with a 27-yard field goal from
kicker Brad Smith ’07.

On the ensuing possession, Davidson cornerback Patrick FitzGerald ’08 recorded his fifth interception of the season and took it 26
yards the other way to the Drake 41. The pick fueled the ’Cats, and Davidson converted the turnover into seven
points. Quarterback Ryan Alexander ’08 found a crossing Jake Rice ’06 with a sharply thrown ball. Rice, trying to get
to the corner and turn up field, received a monster block from wideout Ryan Hubbard ’08 and sprinted down the
sideline for the touchdown. The ’Cats took a 10-7 lead with 3:46 remaining in the first quarter.

Co-captain Alex Arinsmier ’06 sparked the team on the next defensive series when he picked off a ball across the
middle. Alexander went to the air once again and found tight end Jackson Whetsel ’07 in the end zone for
his second touchdown completion. With the crowd roaring and the ’Cats leading 17-7, Drake turned up their level of play.

The Bulldogs punched in touchdowns on their next two possessions to take a 20-17 lead with 7:59 left before the
half, one they would never relinquish. Drake tacked on 10 points before the halftime horn to take a 30-17 score
and all the momentum into the locker room.

Turnovers and missed opportunities cost the ’Cats in the second half. A failed field goal at the start of the
third quarter would prove to be the last real scoring chance for Davidson.
