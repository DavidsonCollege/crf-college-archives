Ability Sets Pace

The great, and often cumbersome, wheel of Davidson progress turns too slowly for some members of our community, while others
contend that it barges blindly ahead too fast for its own good. Whatever the speed, it seems to be rolling
in the right direction. This was demonstrated last month when the faculty voted to give qualified freshmen advanced standing and
college credit for courses in which they were already proficient (see story on page one). THE DAVIDSONIAN heartily applauds this
action and is just a little surprised that it wasn't taken sooner. One or two points are worth noting:

1) Davidson is keenly aware that it is competing with other schools for top students. The faculty action brings it
more in line with what these colleges already are offering.
2) Our own educational process is certainly strengthened, as will be the grading system. Professors will no longer have to
worry about trying to strike a happy medium between the guy who knows the subject already and the one who
doesn't. Students will no longer have to compete against contemporaries who are able to shatter the bell-shaped curve because of
work done in high school.
3) The entire system depends upon scores achieved on a section of the College Entrance Examination Board Tests, another step
in Davidson's ever-increasing reliance on that institution in order to determine entrance qualifications.

Alteration Without Representation

The Faculty Scheduling Committee has tried repeatedly during the past year to honor prevailing student desires in setting up the
school calendar. In most instances, the student council has been instrumental as the organization through which these desires were made
known to the committee, and in most cases, the council's recommendations have been accepted. However, the student council appears to
have overplayed its role as representative of student opinion when it made a recommendation this week to the scheduling committee
that next year's semester break be lengthened at the expense of the Christmas holidays.

No doubt the council meant well by making a recommendation to lengthen next year's semester break by lengthening the class
time between Thanksgiving and Christmas. However, inherent in this request are several disturbing repercussions which should be carefully considered. Aside
from the risk of abusing its privilege with an unusually cooperative faculty committee, the student council has stepped on a
great many toes, particularly in regard to the proposed shortening of the Christmas holidays. Many Davidson students who work during
the Christmas holidays count on the early exodus date to give them a jump on competition for scarce Christmas jobs.
Also, for many out-of-state students, the Christmas holidays are the only opportunity during the school year for a decent vacation
at home. The two days at Christmas mean two more days at home, whereas even the proposed extended semester break
would hardly be long enough to warrant a trip of any length, not to mention the fact that Davidson's semester
break rarely coincides with anybody else's anyway.

But the most disturbing part of the council's action is that in pressing its recommendation on to the scheduling committee,
the council apparently made no attempt to sound out the feelings of the student body. This despite the fact that
many students obviously would strongly oppose shortening the Christmas holidays. On top of that, the vote of the student council
was only a very slim 5-4 in favor of the recommendation, indicating a close split of opinion on the council
itself. We hope that in considering the council's request, the scheduling committee will take into account not only the close
student council vote, but the votes of a large number of Davidson students who were not given an opportunity to
express their views on the matter by the student council.

Greek Week

Boys, your humor evades me. Skit Night this year was chock-full of 3) The skits were the products of little
boys who seemed to be trying very hard to impress a "wild" fraternity society. But you are sorely mistaken if
you intend to entertain fraternity men at Davidson by picking up muck from the gutter and dispersing it with a
half-hearted toss. The skits were, almost without exception, composed of jokes we've heard before. And we didn't laugh with any
particular glee when we heard them the first time. Skit Night has been auditioning for the scrap heap for several
years now. This time it has probably burned itself out in a blaze of backslapping and a stench of profanity.
It was generally presented without that originality or talent. Johnny Rogers, IFC president, has promised that the Skit Night issue
will be at the top of the agenda of next Monday's regular Council meeting. The attitude of the faculty was
reflected in the judging of the skits; the top three places went to those skits which were the least risque
and showed the most originality. You can cover up apathy with T.N.T., but it still leaves its odor.

From Hell And Back? By Adams

Dean Of Students Clarifies Make-Up Review Policies

French Veto Of Britain Weakens EEC: Lewis

BY JONATHAN S. LEWIS
Richardson Scholar

Many of you have heard a great deal recently about France's veto of Britain's membership in the European Economic Community
(EEC). This action by President Charles de Gaulle has had significant implications for the future of European integration and the
balance of power within the EEC. The veto has weakened the EEC by excluding Britain, a major economic and political
player, from the community. This decision has also strained relations between France and other EEC members who supported Britain's entry.

The EEC, established by the Treaty of Rome in 1957, aimed to create a common market and promote economic integration
among its member states. The exclusion of Britain has disrupted these goals and raised questions about the future direction of
the EEC. The veto has also highlighted the differing visions of European integration held by France and other EEC members.
While France has emphasized the importance of maintaining national sovereignty, other members have advocated for deeper integration and cooperation.

The French veto has also had broader implications for the global balance of power. By excluding Britain, France has weakened
the EEC's ability to compete with other major economic powers, such as the United States and the Soviet Union. This
decision has also raised concerns about the stability and unity of the EEC, as well as its ability to address
common challenges and achieve its long-term goals.

In conclusion, the French veto of Britain's membership in the EEC has had significant implications for the future of European
integration and the balance of power within the EEC. This decision has weakened the EEC, strained relations between its members,
and raised questions about the future direction of European integration. It is essential for the EEC to address these challenges
and work towards a more inclusive and cooperative future.

CIA Releases Head Schedule

The CIA has announced the release of its new head schedule, which outlines the agency's plans for the upcoming year.
The schedule includes a series of meetings and events aimed at improving the agency's operations and enhancing its ability to
address national security threats. The release of the head schedule is part of the CIA's ongoing efforts to increase transparency
and accountability within the agency.

The schedule includes several key initiatives, such as the establishment of new training programs for CIA officers, the development of
advanced technologies for intelligence gathering, and the implementation of new strategies for counterterrorism and cybersecurity. These initiatives are designed to
enhance the CIA's capabilities and ensure that it remains at the forefront of national security efforts.

The release of the head schedule also highlights the CIA's commitment to collaboration and cooperation with other government agencies and
international partners. The agency plans to work closely with its counterparts in the intelligence community, as well as with law
enforcement agencies and foreign governments, to address common security challenges and promote global stability.

In conclusion, the release of the CIA's head schedule is a significant step towards improving the agency's operations and enhancing
its ability to address national security threats. The schedule outlines a series of key initiatives aimed at increasing transparency, accountability,
and collaboration within the agency. These efforts are essential for ensuring that the CIA remains at the forefront of national
security efforts and continues to effectively protect the United States and its interests.

TOILET FACILITIES

1. During the early stages of the move to the new building, toilet facilities will not be available at the
new site. However, all toilet facilities in the old building will remain in operation until the move is completed, at
which time it is anticipated that all the toilet facilities in the new building will be activated. Upon activation of
facilities in the new building, the downtown toilet facilities will be rescheduled to provide for use on Tuesdays and Thursdays,
except national holidays. Personnel assigned to the new building prior to the activation of all toilet facilities in the new
building will be expected to make prior provisions consistent with personal comfort. It is anticipated that prior to Christmas 1967
at least two temporary toilet facilities will be made available in the new building if funds permit. If so, this
temporary facility will be located on the seventh floor adjacent to the public telephones and in the second sub-basement adjacent
to the boiler room. For security reasons, personnel will not frequent gas stations, restaurants, and other public facilities.Here is the

economically tied to the Commonwealth. Thus the European Free Trade Association (the "Outer Seven"—Britain, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Portugal, Austria, Switzerland)
was formed. These countries are coordinating internal trade barriers. They have erected their own external barriers and are not seeking
political unity. This was not intended as a challenge to the Common Market, but as a means toward eventual total
European economic cooperation. Since 1957, the goal for European political union has become more apparent. Commonwealth trade has fallen since
the Six have grown overall faster than the Seven. Hence, Britain applied for membership in the Common Market. France has
now rejected Britain's bid. Norway and Denmark, who had applied for membership conditional on Britain's acceptance, have withdrawn. De Gaulle
reasoned that Britain was essentially a maritime power, unlike the more cohesive and diverse nations of the world. Therein lies
the most unfortunate aspect of British exclusion. As it stands, the Common Market is self-sufficient, protectionist, and seeking its own
prosperity. The few smallest countries want Britain in, to counterbalance France's power and to give the Common Market a worldwide
orientation, based on the British Commonwealth. The concept was of a strong, united Europe of an equal partner to the
U.S., together forming the remainder of the Free World, which would be a vast trading area. This would be economically
sustainable against communism. Britain's exclusion from the Common Market will slow down European economic and political unity. Kennedy's Free Trade
Agreement is now virtually useless as a power to form a free trade area between Europe and America, and agreement
on world commodities is less likely. The resentment of the other five countries in the Common Market against France could
break even this institution, an event which would be disappointing for Europe and the Free World. NATO is likely to
be weakened, and the lack of political unity removed any chance of putting into person Kennedy's vision of a European
multilateral nuclear force. It can only be hoped that the pressures that will be brought to bear on De Gaulle
in the near future might persuade him to allow Britain into the European Economic Community on reasonable terms.

BY RICHARD C. BURTS
Dean Of Students

Two absentee regulations put into effect in September place a strengthened student responsibility on attendance at announced tests. Make-ups are
permitted only when the cause for missing is "due to circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the student." In the
interest of consistency, approval for a make-up is granted only by the dean of students or his representative. Clearly recognized
reasons are confinement to the infirmary, certification by the college physician, critical illness or death in the immediate family; other
circumstances where the student has an obligation (not his clear choice) to be away from the campus will be acted
on in line with the facts of each situation. There is an effort to cut down on "dives." Sleeping through
is definitely not an adequate excuse for a cut. As a carry-over from the prior regulations, the dean's office has
ruled that students away on official college trips and returning after midnight on a one-day trip or after 2 p.m.
on a two-day trip may be excused and given a make-up on a test scheduled for the next day. Where
it is feasible, the request for a make-up test should be made as soon as the conflict is apparent. A
personal request is the preferred means of communication asking for a make-up. Invariably the appeal is given in writing and
is addressed to the professor in the course. Recently the Executive Committee considered a request for an official relief from
an announced test because three were scheduled on that same day. Several factors were taken into account. First, some years
ago the faculty scheduled tests in much the same way as final exams are now scheduled. This fixed timing in
some instances did not fit the general needs in subject material and the system of central scheduling was dropped as
unsatisfactory. Second, a number of students remember the final exam schedule in 1960-61 when students were allowed to change one
examination if there were three. In reality, the schedule currently used for fall breaks; the difference between final exams and
interim tests is such that the exam relief of 1960-61 was parallel to the current requests. Third, there is a
trend among Davidson students to emphasize tests by studying for them in a concentrated manner rather than spreading study time
equitably over a popular period of time. Fourth, there is a student feeling that he ought to have only one
academic obligation per day; the student must get over that multiple obligations can bite. Fifth, the occurrence of three tests
on a very infrequent occasion is not a large part of the career of any individual student in Davidson. With
these considerations in mind, the committee denied the request and at the same time recognized that the pressures caused by
three tests a day can be met by the caliber of student in Davidson College today.

Shelters... Choose Yours Today
BY CARL KLEIN

A certain place was populous
Until they dropped the bomb.
Its citizenry truly was
A fearless free conglom!
Which at each rising sun would say:
"Surely it won't be today."

One tremulous individual, who
Destruction in the future spied,
A method which was certain to
Protect his being he applied—
To save himself from Death's grim hug
A shelter underground he dug.

A few took up the cry he raised.
A sense of duty true and strong
Was with them; therefore nothing fazed
"So that we ourselves might save
More Fallout Shelters we must have!"

And so this brave trustworthy few;
Their duty set before their eyes,
Labored till their dream came true.
(Loyal men they were, and wise.
Each one a Boy Scout could have been,
Had he been reverent and clean.)

Above each basement entranceway
Appeared a black and yellow sign,
(Also above each cavity—
Be it sewer, cave, or mine.)
Each one claiming, don't you see,
A Fallout Shelter there to be.

Before too many days had passed
The air was hewn by fearful cry:
"Get thee to a Shelter, fast!"
People hastened to comply,
But each one was doomed to find
He could not quite make up his mind!

They perished in the streets that day
In sight of Shelters Underground,
And if you'd not wind up that way
Be guided by this maxim sound;
If you would to a Shelter run
You'd darn well better know which one.

Chatham President Urges Less Trivia For Freshmen

Pittsburgh, Pa. — (LP) — "Stripping the trivia from college life," in convocation by Dr. Edward D. Eddy, Jr., president
of Chatham College. He pointed to the interaction in campus life as the first place to change. "If we honestly
believe that the business of college is the business of learning, then let us demonstrate that belief in the publications
and orientation programs before they enter college and in the activities scheduled for them during those first weeks on campus.
Some of these (happenings) are so antiquated as to be ludicrous. We no longer debate having. In turn, let us
no longer perpetuate over-prolonged 'phasing' into the business of learning. After orientation, the Frosh should be thick with vigor for
the experience of the Frosh year. Practically, for most students today the freshman year is nothing but repetition and disappointment.
In the freshman year, as well as throughout the entire curriculum, we cannot afford to do anything less than rip
out without mercy the repetitions, the irrelevancy, and the lack of focus. We cannot afford to do anything less during
the first student year on the mere knowledge-challenged platform they have now become."
