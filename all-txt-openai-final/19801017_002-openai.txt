Among users, DeSieno said. DeSieno said it is imperative that the Center make students computer literate. He added that he is working on a proposal for a National Science Foundation grant to help develop computer literacy at Davidson. He also plans to set up workshops to introduce all freshmen to the operation of the computer. DeSieno said that the role of the Computer Services Center will be “providing assistance to every constituency.” The administration will be able to use the computer system to modernize recordkeeping. Students will find it useful in a variety of courses. For example, the computer has been used in math work and is: The old computer system will be phased out. This process will take several years. In the meantime, the Computer Services Center and a faculty committee will shop for the new system and have it put into operation.

**Laundry**

At the request, the students informally agreed to form a committee to study the viability of such a system. The committee will meet next Tuesday. Complaints about the quality of the laundry service dealt with shrinkage, staining, bleaching, lost clothing, and missing buttons. Currie said he would “straighten out” these problems “right away.” “We feel that the majority of students receive a satisfactory service at a satisfactory price.” This year’s $200 fee was up $20 from last year due to inflation. The fee provides for sheets and pillowcases, clothes washing, and shirt service. Students pay about 30 percent less than the public for the extra cost services of dry cleaning, pressing, and alterations. A “roughly comparable service” at Duke University last year cost about 35 percent more than Davidson’s service did, Currie said. The laundry is a nonprofit “auxiliary enterprise” of the College with a budget of $336,000 this year.

**Libertarian Party on the rise in 50 states**

Three North Carolina Libertarian Party candidates appeared before a small group of students in the 900 Room Sunday afternoon. The election forum, sponsored by the Davidson College Libertarian Party, included Rick Pasotto, candidate for the U.S. Senate, Bobby Emory, candidate for Governor of North Carolina, and Craig Franklin, candidate for state Lieutenant Governor. The speakers stressed major issues of concern to Davidson Libertarians. Franklin defined a Libertarian as “someone who is liberal with your freedom but conservative with your money.” “We believe the government’s role is to protect individual rights rather than to impose any sort of equality,” Franklin said. He also emphasized the party’s commitment to the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment by the North Carolina legislature. “ERA is the only way of implementing equal rights today. Out of 34 states needed to ratify the amendment, 31 have already done so. North Carolina is unfortunately not among them. If we could push it through this year, it could break the psychological log jam in other states. It only lost in the Senate by two votes in 1978.” Pasotto voiced opposition to a revival of the draft. “A draft is nothing more than involuntary servitude. It’s slavery, to put it bluntly. For manpower, the military should stick to the volunteer system.” When asked if such a stipulation would interfere with U.S. military capability, Pasotto responded that “any war today would be fought on technological grounds rather than on the basis of sheer number of troops.” Both Franklin and Pasotto conceded that they had little chance of winning this election, yet each felt certain of future success given continued party growth. “Roger MacBride, the Libertarian candidate for President in 1976, only polled around 275,000 votes. We estimate that Ed Clark, our candidate this year, will receive somewhere around two million votes,” said Franklin. Pasotto said he expected a Libertarian to be elected to Congress by 1982. Franklin was even more optimistic. “Two years ago most people didn’t know what a Libertarian was. We’re making extraordinary gains now, especially on college campuses. People recognize us.” “We’re organized in all fifty states and we’re on the ballot in all states, the District of Columbia, and Guam. This is the first time a third party has managed that since 1916.” “Given the continued growth of the party and the weakness of the Democrats and Republicans, we should be a major political force in the nation by the middle of the decade. I anticipate that we will have a man in the White House by 1996,” Franklin said.

Synco wants to keep one cul-de-sac narrower, Project Officer Donald Cheek said, to prevent its becoming a “raceway.” Any request for variance must receive approval from the Building Inspector, MacCormac said. —The limited capacity of the sewer line which would pick up the development’s sewage. The line can now handle only 20 additional homes. Expanding the line, MacCormac said, would cost “upwards from $175,000.” A further complication, MacCormac said, is that Davidson has a commitment to tie into the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Utility Departments (CMUD) county-wide sewage facility on MacDowell Creek, south of Huntersville. The McDowell Creek plant is completed and in operation, but negotiations are still pending between Charlotte and the towns of northern Mecklenburg County regarding the control and rate structure of the town sewer systems. A decision as to whether CMUD or Davidson will control Davidson’s sewer system will “establish responsibility” for the system, MacCormac said, and clarify who should pay for alterations. MacCormac said she hopes for a resolution of the negotiations by this winter. Because of the sewer line’s limitations, however, Synco cannot build more than 20 homes until the sewer line is expanded. —The housing project's density. The Synco plans call for a project density of 4.3 home units per acre for the entire development of 150 units, Yelverton said. The area is presently zoned commercial, with a maximum density of 3.87 units. While the proposed density is higher than that allowed by the zoning law, the special use permit allows a density of up to 12 units per acre. —The impact of the development on the lake and on town services. One of the chief tasks of the ad hoc committeewill be to determine the town’s legal standing with respect to water use and membership in the Synco development’s Homeowner's Association. The Synco development would be on a small 400-acre lake separated from Lake Norman. Synco’s plan calls for the construction of 72 boat slips and a boat ramp with the 150 units. The lake is “not large enough to handle power boats” from 150 units, Yelverton wrote in a letter to the Oct. 9 issue of The Mecklenburg Gazette. “We would be supportive of any movement to limit horsepower or eliminate motors altogether on the lake,” Yelverton added. Although the lake falls within Davidson town limits, it is unclear whether the town has jurisdiction to set rules for use of the lake. “We don’t know what the town can do with respect to water use,” Town Attorney and ad hoc committee member Richard Kline said. 

In addition, the Synco proposal calls for the establishment of a Homeowner’s Association in the project to legislate private restrictions within the development, such as lake access and road use. If Davidson, as owner of the roads within the project, were to become a partner in this association, Kline said, the town could help enforce restrictions. “It could be advantageous both for the town and for the residents,” Kline said, “but it’s never been done in North Carolina.” In addition to Kline, the ad hoc committee will consist of Town Board members William Ward and William Mayhew and Planning Board Chairperson Annamarie Burts. The Planning Board also called for a complete review of the Special Use permit ordinance once a final decision is made on the Synco proposal. Yelverton said he expects the revisions to lead to better coordination between the Special permit and other regulations, such as subdivision ordinances. 

The Town Board's decision did not surprise Yelverton. “I was hoping they’d accept the Planning Board's recommendation [to issue a permit immediately],” Yelverton said, “but it’s a big decision for the town to make.” Yelverton said Synco hopes to begin construction “as soon as possible... we’d hoped it would be before the end of the year.” The company would first build the 20 units possible with the present sewer line, and then “as sewer becomes available we can proceed.” Yelverton said Synco had not discussed whether they would be willing to help finance the sewer line expansion if requested. In addition to the 35 acres adjacent to Griffith Street, Synco also owns the peninsula on Lake Norman on the other side of I-77. Yelverton said Synco has “no definite plans” for this land. Construction of additional housing would depend on the market situation, he said. While this peninsula is outside of Davidson town limits, Yelverton added, town zoning laws still apply within one mile of the limits. Moreover, if Synco did build a project on this land, it might be annexed to the town. “It would certainly be in Davidson’s interest,” Yelverton said, “to increase its tax base.” 

Library Director Leland Park criticized the Synco proposal in a letter to The Mecklenburg Gazette (Oct. 9) and at the Town Board meeting Tuesday. Park said he is concerned about the extent, fairness, and speed of the development. Building more than 150, or as many as 900 units, Park said, would raise the population of Davidson “two or three fold.” Such a change would have drastic effects in town politics, for example. With such a large population the area could “control the destiny of the town of Davidson.” Park was also concerned about Synco’s requests for variances from the town zoning laws. In such a potentially large project, he said, the “standards that you set initially should be the same throughout. You don’t want exceptions to the rule [from the outset].” Finally, Park said, he is concerned about the preservation of Davidson's sense of community. “This town assimilates new people,” he told the Town Board, “but a large number of people coming into the town in a short amount of time cannot be assimilated.” Yelverton argued that development will be “very gradual,” with the first 150 units appearing in “three to five years.” Park also said the new housing will not be useful to Davidson College faculty. The cost of the houses, from $75,000 to $100,000, is prohibitive to most professors, who need housing in the $45,000 to $60,000 range, Park said. 

Davidson College does have a stake in the Synco development, however. The College has “about $25,000 worth of shares in the Lake Norman Company,” according to Business Manager Robert Currie. The Lake Norman Company owns the land in question. Synco acts in an “advisory and managerial capacity for the Lake Norman Company,” Yelverton said. Davidson College invested in Lake Norman, Currie explained, because College President Samuel Spencer and Trustees felt that Synco understood the College’s interest in the town’s development. “Davidson is going to grow,” Currie said, “the question is how can you encourage the best type of growth?” Many of those working at Synco, including its President, Reitzel Snider '57, are Davidson alumni, Yelverton noted. 

North Carolina Waterskiing School owner Russ Debuc expressed a different concern at the Town Board meeting. Debuc is afraid the Synco development will ruin his livelihood. For three years Debuc has taught waterskiing on the lake. His site is now used by both the Davidson College and Central Piedmont Community College waterski programs. Debuc has also hosted two intercollegiate regional tournaments. “When I heard there would be 72 boat slips on the lake, of course I had a heart attack,” Debuc said, “That lake cannot support 72 power boats at one time.” Any limitation on horsepower on the lake would ruin Debuc’s business, he said. Debuc also cited the safety hazards involved in overcrowded lakes. Debuc’s site is the “best in the state,” according to sophomore Lee McCormick, Secretary-Treasurer of the Ski Club. McCormick said the loss of the site would be a severe blow to Davidson's waterskiing program, which involves about 70 students, including “15 or 20 hard-core serious skiers.” 

The Synco development would “certainly upgrade the general area,” Park said. The Town Board is being “very deliberative,” he added, “and that’s all that we ask.” The town has “no interest in delaying Synco,” MacCormac said, but the pace of the project will depend on “how complex the legal issue is.” “It’s a time-consuming process,” Yelverton said, “we understand that.”
