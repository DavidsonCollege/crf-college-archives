Major Decisions Series:

A Night at the Court

Alvarez Student Union—a
new initiative established in a
joint effort between Campus Min-
istries and Career Services seeks
to educate students on how their
late-night decisions can have a tre-
mendous impact upon a student’s
spiritual purity and future eligibil-
ity for a job.

“By posting these anonymous
interviews on bathroom mirrors
across campus, we hope to pro-
mote discussion and make students
really consider their actions,” said
College Chaplain Reverend Har-
vey Johnson. Reprinted here are
two sides of this Major Decision.

OK, I’m on the dance floor

Deciding whether to hook up or
not can be a stressful experience

with my best girls. Pheela Thigh
Higha throws the best parties.
Oh—some guy is trying to dance
with me so I look at my friends to
get their approval. I don’t get the
“he’s a creeper” look so I decide
to do the half turn. It’s my AT
that I’ve totally been crushing on,
he has such a cute accent. OMG!
I love Chris Brown, I would let
him beat me any day.... So we’ve
been dancing for four songs now,
if we go to the Outpost together
we’re totally gonna hook up.... He
ordered a full spicy chicken que-
sadilla and he’s devouring it. It’s
gross; I didn’t realize how drunk
he was. He tries to say something
but I can’t understand cause he’s
slurring his words. He asks where
I live and I wonder...should I hook
up with this guy?

10:00 p.m.: Some chicks show

up at our pre-party in Jamieson.

10:30 p.m.: I lose at beer pong
so I start to spit game.

10:45 p.m.: All the hot chicks
are sober and I look like an idiot so
I go to the fridge and make a mixed
drink (rum and coke, fo sho).

10:53 p.m.: Get a text from this

one chick “hey whats going on to-
night” like she doesn’t know my
place is throwing down.

10:53-11:04 p.m.: Text-blasting
this one chick, she’s at the court
and I’m feeling good so it’s about
time to head over.

11:30 p.m.: Finally make it to
the court. I immediately get on the
risers where my boys are kickin it.

11:35 p.m.: I move in on a cute

girl but she says she has to go find

her friend...bull!

11:38 p.m.: I do a couple laps
around the joint to see where all the
honeys are at.

11:43 p.m.: I see the girl that
was texting me earlier so we start
to dance. I forgot she was one of
my AT students; ¡Dios mio!

11:44 p.m.: I put my hand on
her hip and she’s cool with it.

11:48 p.m.: This chick is gettin’
freaky, hell yeah!

11:56 p.m.: One of my friends
slaps my ass as he walks by and we
high five.

12:13 p.m.: I’ve been dancing
forever and it sucks so I grab this
chick and tell her we’re going to
the Outpost, she’s down.

12:47 p.m.: After devouring a
delicious spicy chicken dilla I ask
the girl casually where she lives
on campus and I wonder...should I
hook up with this girl?

Essentially Sold into Slavery

Washington, D.C.—President
Obama signed into law yesterday
a nearly trillion-dollar bailout plan
to stimulate the sagging American
economy.

“This bill didn’t need much
consideration,” said Secretary of
the Treasury Tim Geithner con-
cerning his outline of the strategy,
which was released yesterday. “Af-
ter all, who’s going to end up even-
tually paying this $787 billion? Not
us!”

The details
of the outline
include expla-
nation of the
passage of re-
sponsibility for
this money to
the approxi-
mately 74 mil-
lion children
residing in
America. It de-
fines the innumerable crimes of the
youth of this nation that have con-
fined the group to this unappealing
responsibility, namely:

1) Ignoring/skimping on/com-
plaining about school assignments

1a) Not attending said estab-
lishments of learning in the first
place (i.e. feigning serious illness
through manipulation of thermom-
eters, guiltlessly persuading inno-
cent mothers, etc.)

2) Shamelessly partaking in
such activities as enjoying the
sandbox, playing video games, and
eating their dessert before their
vegetables.

3) Inflicting on their well-
meaning parents enormous costs
for food, clothing, shelter, and en-
tertainment. Eating too much (i.e.
teenagers).

4) Being caught by parents in
the act of blatant physical displays
of affection in one’s basement.

4a) Catching one’s parents in
said acts of blatant physical dis-
plays of affection.

5) Playing music in cars so loud
that respectable citizens are often
duped into believing there is an
earthquake.

“We believe that America’s
youth should begin preparing itself
for this well-deserved responsibil-
ity,” Obama was quoted as saying
as he signed the bill, “Damn kids.”
