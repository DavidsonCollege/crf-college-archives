Frank Caldwell of the Court of Control announced this week at a recent meeting of the Court, together with some
of the leaders of the student body, the possibility of abolishing freshmen’s next year, was seriously considered because of cloth
shortage due to war needs. This consideration was prompted by the seeming reluctance of the freshmen to co-operate in keeping
what should be a proud tradition.

deal of interest in sports here in Davidson. As a freshman, he went out for football. He is now a

Fulton Talks About Ordeal Of Christians In China

Mission Secretary Tells Of Open Doors In China After Present War

Dr. C. Darby Fulton, of Nashville, Executive Secretary of foreign missions of the Presbyterian church in the United States, was
on the campus from Friday morning of last week through Sunday evening. During this time he gave a series of
talks to the students of Davidson college on the great necessity of foreign missions and the chance which they have
of surviving the present world conflict.

In the past few weeks Dr. Fulton has been traveling through the South giving lectures in some of the Presbyterian
institutions in which he has stressed the great importance of foreign missions and the chance which they have of surviving
the present world conflict.

During his visit at Davidson, Dr. Darby Fulton conducted an open forum on the subject of “What the church can
do in a world at war.” The discussion was held Friday evening in Phi hall.

Church In Peace

The church should begin now to formulate a workable plan to present to the peace-makers. It should be given them
while they are in the talk of preparing for a “just endurable” peace, it seemed timely to face the church
should not be obliterated.

Not Obliterated

Though it seems to us in America that Christianity has been all but obliterated in the far east, this is
not as it seems. There are many native Christians in Japan and will continue to be in spite of the
hardships which they are having to undergo. You can burn a church to the ground, but you cannot burn Christianity
out of the hearts of the people.

YMCA Holds Open Forum

Discuss Church’s Function In World At War

5 P.M. Monday, March 2, 1942 Place: Charlotte, N.C. Weather: Horrible.

As recounted by two of Davidson's more illustrious freshmen, Henderson Belk and Louis Bibb, as an actual(?) experience. Time: Friday
chapel service, Dr. Fulton gave a brief resume of the situation in which the missions of China and Japan now
lie. He said that naturally as present Christianity was going through a terrible ordeal in the totalitarian nation of Japan.
Due to the war which that little nation has forced to a head there has been a total blackout of
information from the missionaries which were known to be in Japan in the time our hostilities started.

Blizzard

The icy northwest gale whipped around the dingy brick walls of the city’s bus terminal as two dejected figures reluctantly
forced their way through the crowded warm station. They hesitated before the electrically controlled doorway turned up inadequate coat collars
and struggled manfully out into the blizzard.

northern and southern colleges.

Resolved, that the Federal Government should regulate by law all labor unions in the United States. This is the query
which Davidson’s debaters will uphold in their contests with other colleges. The northern team will end with an engagement with
Haverford College outside of Philadelphia.Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

offering at vespers last Sunday. This sum will go for the support of Presbyterian missionaries abroad. The goal for the

chance to contribute to this cause. This offering was taken in conjunction with the sermon presented by Dr. C. Darby

a secret meeting of the Court, a definite decision on this matter will be reached. The next regular meeting of
