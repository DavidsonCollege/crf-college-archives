spread of moral culture. Finally there is a universal movement for education among all classes and conditions of people. All
these forward steps are the sure signs of the omnipresent power of the pilot at the helm. Such being the
case, what are our duties? They are threefold. Our first task is to spread moral culture, the principles of Christianity,
justice, unselfishness and devotion to the welfare of our fellow man. The second line of action is to spread evangelism,
enlightenment and education to all people by every possible means; and the third is the stern duty of suppressing all
types of lawlessness and the reinforcing of all institutions of law and order. Then, and not until then, will the
peril of Bolshevism be safely passed and the new era inaugurated. This is the inspiring platform on which all lovers
of law and order and human welfare can unite with the inspiring certainty that, with the help of God, through
these instrumentalities, our future civilization will be marked, not by the bloody tyranny of the proletariat or the ignorant rule
of the mob, which would threaten the very existence of civilization of itself, but by the simultaneous rising into the
full realization of their citizenship of the great brotherhood of enlightened free and happy people of the nations of the
world.

The Fine Art of Kissing
By A. WISE GUY

People will kiss! Yet only one in ten thousand know how to extract the maximum of bliss from ruby lips.
And yet it is simple, at least for the initiated. Follow these directions for best results:

First, know with whom you are clinching—don’t make any mistakes, although a mistake may be a good one. Don’t jump
like a cat for a mouse and smack the dainty thing on the arm, or in the ear, or on
the head. Do not be in a hurry! The gentleman should be taller, although this isn’t absolutely necessary. He should
have a clean face, a kindly eye, and a mouth full of expression. Don’t be anxious to kiss in a
crowd. Two are plenty to corner and nab a kiss, more would spoil the fun. Take the left hand of
the female in your right. Let your hat go. Throw your left arm over the shoulder of the lady and
slip it around to her right side below her arm. Don’t be in a hurry! Her left arm is in
your right—let there be a faint pressure on that, not like the grip of a vise, but a gentle grasp
full of thought, respect, and electricity. Do not be in a hurry! Her head lies on your shoulder. You are
heart to heart. Look deeply into her half-closed orbs. Gently, but firmly, press her to your vest. Stand firm, be
brave, but do not be in a hurry! Her lips are almost open. Lean slightly with your head, take careful
aim—the lips meet, the eyes close, the heart opens, the soul rides through tempests, but do not be in a
hurry! Heaven opens before you, the earth flies from under your feet like a blazing rocket across the evening sky.
Don’t be afraid. No fuss, no noise, no fluttering, no squirming. You are twanging the golden chords of ecstasy. Do
not be in a hurry!

Men’s U. S. Army Munson-last Shoes at $2.95
Sizes 5½ to 12

Never again will you be able to buy these shoes at such a low price. We were lucky in finding
a manufacturer who was overstocked with them and needed ready cash, so we bought them at almost one-half of the
regular price. This shoe is made over the U. S. Army Munson last, with extra heavy stitching; full-grained chrome brown
leather used throughout. An ideal shoe for workmen, farmers, carpenters, and motormen, who are obliged to be on their feet
all day. Send correct size. Pay Postman $2.95 on delivery, or send us a money order. If you are not
satisfied with these shoes after you examine them, we will promptly refund your money.

Full Line of U. S. Army Munson last shoes, sizes 5½ to 12, which was the entire surplus of the
society. Ex-president Wilson wrote the president a letter telling about the formation of the society. Ex-president Wilson wrote an interesting
letter.

Dr. J.W. MacConnell gave an address on “Co-operation.” F. L. Jackson and Mr. Titty discussed the need for a hotel,
to be modern and up-to-date in every respect and of reasonable size. There is certainly no doubt that there is
an urgent need for a good hotel in Davidson.

Miss Regna Duke, of Statesville, was the charming guest of Miss Evelyn Potts last Sunday. Miss Flora Stuart, a nurse
at the Presbyterian Hospital in Charlotte, spent Thursday with her parents, Mr. and Mrs. John Stuart.

The main address of the evening was made by Dr. Henry Louis Smith, president of Washington and Lee University. Doctor
Smith gave the association and its purpose a big boost and offered much encouragement to the new organization. Doctor Smith
said that he had been told, both in Atlanta and in Richmond, that North Carolina is leading the other States
in its progressive movements.

Miss West, head of the Spanish department of Queens College, accompanied by Miss Elizabeth Laird and other friends, motored to
Davidson to see her brother, E. A. West, ’24, last weekend.

Reverend Mr. Foster, pastor of the Methodist Church, has been confined to his home for several days with influenza. He
was not able to fill his pulpit last Sunday. A large part of the Methodist Congregation attended the services at
the Presbyterian Church.

A man slightly under the weather approached a policeman and asked where he could find a certain place. The reply
was, “Over there.” To which the tipsy one replied: “Thash funny, Ossifer, over there they said it was over here.”

Club Meets With Mrs. Potts
The As You Like It Club met at the home of Mrs. Cloyd Potts, Friday afternoon. Mrs. Hugh Grey, in
her unique way, reviewed Susan Glaspell’s “Jury of Her Peers.” Mrs. Kenneth Foreman told of the life of Sidney Lanier,
our great Southern poet, and read some of his poetry. Refreshments were served at the conclusion of the meeting.

A little negro school girl, in a physiology test, wrote the following answer: “The haid holds the skull and the
brains is there if there is any, the chest holds the liver and the lungs, and the stummick holds the
entrails and the vowels which are a, e, i, o, u, and sometimes w and y.”
