October 31, 1975

Last year, Barber became interested in Greanias’ new play. Along with his interest in bicentennial drama, Wilson, to Barber, possesses
a special association with Davidson, having attended here his freshman year (1873-74).

Over the summer, Barber undertook considerable research about Wilson, in order to better understand the man. This, to Barber, is
no easy task. In the view of many Americans, Wilson was an unsmiling, unsympathetic, and distinctly impersonal figure.

To Barber, one of the primary purposes of the play will be to portray the Wilson little seen—a very human
President, capable of strong emotion, ambition, and desires.

With the focus upon Wilson the man, drama and historical reconstruction are united. Wilson, upon his inauguration of his second
administration in March 1916, was faced with, in Barber’s opinion, “the greatest problems of any President we have had.” Also
imbued with strong moral principles, Wilson, perhaps tragically, attempted to put these principles into practice.

Wilson is the “closest thing to a Greek tragic figure” of 20th-century American politics. What, according to Barber, is his
“tragic flaw?” On this subject, the director was conspicuously silent, leaving something for the curious—with or without the play—to find
out.
