**Seniors searching for class gift ideas**

By BETH LINDSEY
Staff writer

The Senior Class Gift Committee has been hard at work trying to decide on the perfect senior class gift for
the class of 1995 — a gift that shows the gratitude as a class for the collective Davidson experience. The
committee, advised by Ryan Harper and co-chaired by Chris Holder and Mary Beth Crawford, faces the difficult task of finding
something the whole class agrees will demonstrate the personality of this particular class as well as one that would improve
Davidson College.

Gifts for the past five years have served a variety of needs here on campus. The class of 1990 established
a fund allocating money for the replacement of trees on campus after the destruction of Hurricane Hugo. The following year
a fund was established to aid the Love of Learning Program. The class of 1992 created a student emergency loan
fund, providing interest-free loans for emergency situations in which students may need cash quickly. The class of 1993 funded the
search for an artist who will create a work of public sculpture for the campus. Finally, the class of 1994
created a scholarship of $2500 per year for a member of the class of 1998.

The opportunities for the class of 1995 are endless. Says Crawford, “Scholarships have been a popular item recently. In my
class alone, 33% of the class has need-based scholarships, and 60% are recipients of some form of scholarship, whether it
is need-based, merit, athletic, or something else.” The class of 1998 has 37% of its members receiving need-based scholarships.

Suggestions thus far have mainly included tangible items on campus. A new entrance sign, new carpet in the library, and
benches around campus are some suggestions. Says Crawford, however, “The Physical Plant can fund this type of project, allowing us
to create funding for something else.” Another suggestion is the establishment of a recycling program. Funding from this graduating class
would support it only for a few years, at which time it risks falling into oblivion. Another idea is to
create a fund for purchasing books for the library or one that would support some particular aspect of the new
Union in the name of the class of 1995.

The committee hopes to narrow down the list of options and reach a decision before spring break. “Our goal is
to get 100% participation on the funding of this gift. The fund-raising plan itself runs two years with individual gifts
being pledged this spring and again next year.” After spring break, members of the committee will choose four class agents
who will each be responsible for approaching four or five people in the class about giving a donation to the
class gift. Currently, the committee requests that seniors leave any other suggestions in the box located in the Union Pit
or inform someone on the committee.

**SGA Committee reaches out**

By JOANNA JOHNSON
Staff writer

The SGA has established an Ad Hoc Communications Committee in order to improve communication between the SGA and the Davidson
College community. The Ad Hoc Communications Committee, composed of SGA members, is essentially a response to...The current Public Relations Committee
informs students about happenings in the SGA. The new committee will take a more active role in informing the school
about the SGA. SGA Vice President Warren Buford insists that many students still have misconceptions about what the SGA does
or what it has the potential to accomplish. He believes that an increased understanding of the SGA will arouse student
interest in the SGA. He states, “We will work as hard as we can, but in order to reach our
full potential, we need student support.”

Buford has many personal committee plans. He proposes that SGA meetings be taped and broadcast on DCTV. Buford also wants
to establish a flow chart so that students will know exactly where to direct their concerns. Additionally, he will suggest
sending an outline of SGA information periodically through campus e-mail. Suggestions on how to improve communication between the SGA and
the Davidson College community will be presented for the first time at this Wednesday’s SGA meeting and will continue for
several weeks. One meeting may be open for students to introduce suggestions to the new Ad Hoc Committee. Anyone is
also welcome to leave suggestions for the SGA in their new e-mail suggestion box (address: @sga).

Budget from page 1

The increase will be about 3.5% for next year, but the non-salary operating expenses will remain frozen for the fifth
year in a row. If the non-salary operating funds were not stagnant, some future cuts would not need to be
made. Williams says, “The academic budget’s share of the whole budget needs to be increased.” Vice President for Business and
Finance Bob Sutton says that the faculty is not the only group not to see an increase in its non-salary
budget. “All non-salary expenses have been more or less frozen. It’s not just faculty; it’s everybody,” he says.

When asked if the athletics department’s 9.2% of the budget was too great, as Williams had suggested, Sutton said it
was the “trustees’ policy ... but as we enter a new era of coping with slowly increasing revenue, everything is
on the table, and it should be.” Williams says that with increased funding to non-salary areas, Davidson could improve some
areas that need attention. Such areas include buying books for the library and CD-ROM technology, which Williams calls “absolutely essential.”
He says, “Davidson is behind the times in terms of the campus network.” The campus network refers to hardwiring all
the buildings and dormitories on campus to connect to the Internet.

According to Williams, the faculty has responded well to the memo and reconciled itself to tighten their belts. “It’s not
a surprise to them, and the faculty is very understanding of the need to be frugal.” He says some professors
drive to Charlotte to buy supplies rather than spend more at the campus bookstore. Williams says that the entire campus
— students, faculty, and staff — must become budget-conscious. He says a main priority should be energy conservation, such as
reducing the $1 million campus electric bill. Williams is confident that these cuts will not become too severe. “By managing
the budget carefully every year, we can avoid a big disaster,” he says.

We do not want the college to think that Experiential Programs is being abandoned because it is so important to
my philosophy of career development to support the liberal arts student where he or she is. We want to encourage
the idea of Experiential Programs. The person who comes to do this job will certainly know that this is a
vital part of what they are going to do. This person will also have more hands-on experience in the placement
area. By placement, we mean adding to the recruiter base.” Wood is concerned that the combination of placement and Experiential
Programs will place too many responsibilities on his
