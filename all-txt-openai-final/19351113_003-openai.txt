# THE DAVIDSONIAN, NOVEMBER 13, 1935

D. C. Music Department Will Sponsor Noted Concertists

*The Famous Siberian Singers Will Be the Highlight Of the Season*

**KRYL’S BAND WELCOMED**

Outstanding Soprano and Organist Also On List

The Davidson College Musical Department will present three more concerts this year featuring Kate Keith Field, soprano; the Siberian Singers; and Thane McDonald, organist. There has already been one concert by Kryl’s band, which proved to be a popular success.

The next concert to be given will be that of Kate Keith-Field on December 9. Miss Field is one of the outstanding young sopranos of the last season, having made a very successful debut in New York City. Since that time she has received much favorable criticism from the music critics of the nation.

The Siberian Singers, a group of ten male voices under the direction of Nicholas Vasilieff, will be the highlight of the series. Each of these ten members is a soloist of unusual ability, yet together they attain a vocal blend as beautiful and sonorous as the tones of an organ. They received their training in the famous Russian Choir, and for the past few years they have been touring the United States. On their first concert of this tour, they created a sensation with the spirit and intensity of emotion in their song. Their phenomenal range is perhaps unequaled by any other male ensemble in the world. Their broadcast over the National Broadcasting Company network so profoundly impressed the radio audience that letters of praise and commendation for their beautiful voices, and the artistic presentation of their programs, were received from every section of the nation. Nicholas Vasilieff will bring this group here on February 25, 1936.

Thane McDonald, one of the most promising young organists of the country, will appear here in a recital sometime in March, 1936. His playing is marked by a brilliance and keen musical understanding which, when added to the tones of the fine Skinner Organ in the Chambers Auditorium, should constitute a very delightful program.

This series is not designed to bring remunerative profit to the College, nor to any person or organization, but its purpose is to present advantages for enjoyment of music—long needed and now demanded.

**New Books Shown In Library Display**

Volumes On Social and Physical Sciences Acquired

Many new books have been placed in the Library, dealing with biographies, music, editing, sociology, literature, and physics. “Contemporary British Literature,” by Fred B. Millett, is an invaluable guide to the work of over 200 modern English writers. “Social Change and Education” is the thirteenth yearbook published by The Department of Superintendence of the National Education Association of the USA. “Fundamentals of Musicianship,” by Merville Smith and Max T. Krone, analyzes the language of music, and presents its essentials in a useful way. “Around the Copydesk,” by George C. Bastian, Leland D. Case, and R. E. Wolsely, is a large pamphlet that will greatly aid the student copywriter in becoming proficient in this science. The biography of “The Francis Preston Blair Family in Politics,” by William E. Smith, presents through the Blairs a running history of the most eventful years in the political history of this country. For the German student, the book, “Don Francisco de Goya,” by Manfred Schneider has recently been placed in the library. “Science and Superstition in the Eighteenth Century,” by Philip Shorr, is a study of the change from superstitious thinking to the curiosity of discovering the nature of things. “Electrons (+ and —), Protons, Photons, Neutrons, and Cosmic Rays,” by Robert A. Millikan, is a review in non-mathematical form of the extraordinary discoveries in physics in modern times. In his book “The Philosophy of a Biologist,” Professor J. S. Haldane expresses his views on the philosophical significance of modern scientific conceptions.

**Museum Shows Exhibit Of Native Birds, Trees**

In the college museum, located on the second floor of Chambers, is an exhibit of wood of forest trees of North Carolina. At present, there are fifty-five specimens in the collection. Each specimen is displayed in such a way as to show the natural bark, a cross-section, and a longitudinal section. The cross and longitudinal sections are shellacked and polished so as to bring out the grain and other features of the wood. Those who are in charge of the museum have been working on this collection for over four years. They expect to add other specimens from time to time. In the museum are also collections of mounted birds, stones, minerals, African relics, arrowheads, sea shells, sea plants, and several other things of great interest.

**Picture Of Martin Is Hung In Library**

A portrait of Dr. William J. Martin, President Emeritus of Davidson College, was hung in the library Saturday, Nov. 2. The picture was painted in 1934 by I. C. von Hausen, but was not immediately located in the library. It has been in the office of Pres. Walter L. Lingle until this past week. Several years ago, the Alumni Association appointed a portrait committee, of which Dr. John H. Davis is chairman. Dr. Davis, of the class of '24, is at present Lingle Professor of Biology at Southwestern, Memphis, Tenn. Dr. William Sayad, '17, located at Palm Beach, Fla., and Greensboro, made the gift of Dr. Martin’s portrait to the college possible. The portrait is the latest of a series hung throughout the library. It is the first on the right upon entering the front door.

**Football Contests Attract Students**

Football enthusiasts, of late, have turned their interests into cold cash by entering various contests of predicting the outcomes of games played each weekend. A tobacco company sponsored one such event through the Student Store, in which the lucky guessers were Eddie Donigan, Charlie Elder, Jim Dorsett, and Dick Wright. A similar affair is promoted each week by a Charlotte newspaper. So far, Jack Westall is the only local student to break into the easy money offered by the paper. The library reading room has been the scene of great industry, as embryonic prognosticators have pored over the sports pages to check up on their picks. The chances of Cape Girardeau Teachers and Muskingum very probably will result in much loss of sleep and many gray hairs to this rabid gathering. The Student Store competition involved foretelling the scores of the Davidson-Citadel and Carolina-Tech games. Donigan came the nearest to the correct score, and received ten dollars for his trouble. Elder was next, taking five as his share, while Dorsett and Wright tied for third. The former was awarded two dollars, and the latter, two cartons of cigarettes.

**MEDICATED WITH INGREDIENTS OF Vicks VapoRub**

Modern successor to old-fashioned cough syrups... more convenient... less expensive... lingers longer in the throat.

**DISPLAY WINDOW ATTRACTS FANS**

Local Merchant Features Athletic and Music Departments Before Crowd

The football and band displays, located in the show windows of a local business house, attracted considerable attention from alumni, students, and friends during the Homecoming weekend. At the base of both display cases were miniature football fields upon which were placed cardboard figures representing the members of the band and football team. The football men were arranged in kick-off formation and the band in the letters, D. C. Suitable photographs and pictures were arranged on the red background. In the back of the band window were pictures of the glee club, the concert band, the R.O.T.C. band, the drum majors, and the band conductors. Also, near the base, were copies of “O Davidson” and “Dear Old Duke,” and a cardboard microphone announcing the new broadcast hour. At the right was a series of photographs, including pictures of the salon orchestra, the Skinner organ, former Davidson bands, and Brock, drum major in '33. In the middle of the entire display, resting on the base of the showcase, was the cup won in the Independence Day Parade, held in Charlotte May 20, 1935. In the football window, two footballs were displayed in prominent positions. The first of these was that used when Davidson beat Duke by twenty points, and the other that which Thad Brock carried 105 yards without scoring. In the background were photographs of the present team, its coaches, its captains, its line, its backfield, and also former Davidson teams. In this group were the '04 team, the '07 team, and the '26 team, state champions. These displays were arranged by members of the coaching staff and the music department.

**Sigma Upsilon Has Discussion**

(Continued from Page 1)

The society’s new members were scheduled for the next meeting, which will be held this coming Monday night. The fraternity has had ten new members this fall. Members are selected from the Senior and Junior Classes and from among those students...Who are especially interested in literary pursuits. The initiation is to be formal as usual. The meetings of Sigma Upsilon are devoted to the reading of papers by the various members of the fraternity, the discussing of topics of literary interest, and the criticizing of the papers read. The fraternity meets once every two weeks and the meetings are held at various houses on Fraternity Court. At each meeting, it is a custom for the society to treat itself to a “feed.” Sigma Upsilon is an honorary fraternity of national standing intended for the lovers of literature among the student body. This organization has been established on Davidson Campus for twenty years or more. Professor E. J. Erwin of our faculty is a past national president of Sigma Upsilon. This fraternity is regarded as one of the most consistently active groups among the honorary societies on the campus. The faculty members are: Prof. E. A. Cumming, Prof. E. J. Erwin, Prof. F. K. Fleagle, Dr. Frazer Hood, Prof. H. T. Lilly, Mr. Grier Martin, Dr. M. E. Sentelle, Dr. F. Shewmake.

By TIM LANDVOIGT
Deploring the terrible number of “Guys from Choisey” that find their way into our fair school, we have attempted to show what will happen to our beloved “Swing” if this mighty pollution does not stop soon.

DA NOO CHOISEY SWING
When Washington and Lee’s guys start to fight,
We're gonna lick those mugs and smear ‘em right.
For W. and L. we'll slug and slug, aw, cheese!
And for the University we'll kill the referees,
We're going to use our brass knucks on those mutts
And show those dirty louses we got guts,
And if you don’t think we'll win, you are nuts, you are nuts,
Rah! Rah! Rah!

Then, too, there is always the menace of school administrations who have the combined broadmindedness of their distinguished ancestors, the W. C. T. U., the Puritans, and the Tennessee anti-evolutionists. It seems that these antique officials believe the words of the “Swing” are uncouth, profane, and entirely unbefitting to the vocabulary of a Washington and Lee gentleman. As a result, they hired Reverend Percy Twittleberry of Devonshire to write new words to the “Swing.”

When Washington and Lee's sons gird their loins,
And in good clean sport with their foe enjoins;
For W. and L. we'll wave our lily flag,
And studies lag,
With perspicacity we'll cross the yard,
And tag the enemy a blow quite hard,
As gracefully we trip across the sod,
Tallyhoo! Tralaa! Huzzah!

Our present Swing is too compromising. It either ought to be purified as Rev. Twittleberry suggests, or strengthened by the addition of some good old New York Choisey verbiage. It is a question for you, my fellow students, to decide. Will you bide with the profane gang, or join the daisy chain gang?

The Ring-Tum Phi For Gala Homecoming Celebration
(Continued from Page 1)
Duke scored a touchdown in each of the four periods. The Wildcats flashed open tactics with forwards and laterals that clicked often for large gains. Davidson made her touchdown when the Blue Devils fumbled, paving the way for the touchdown made by Baxter Yarborough. Saturday night the Alumni danced to the music of Jimmy Poyner and his State Collegians. The formal dance was held in the Ballroom of the Charlotte Hotel Friday night, and in the Dining room of the hotel, Saturday night, the informal dance. A record crowd attended both of these dances.

Princeton University administrators recently announced an expansion plan that calls for the raising of $7,750,000.

W. and L. Students Consider New Wording For The ‘Swing’

PI DELTA ALPHA HEARS DR. TODD
Bacteriologist Talks On Laboratory Researches
Pi Delta Alpha held its initial open meeting of the year, Monday evening, Nov. 11. The speaker for the evening was Dr. L. C. Todd of Charlotte, an eminent bacteriologist. After a few complimentary remarks, he announced that he was going to explain “some clinical applications of elementary laboratory procedure.” The whole subject, he said, was far too large to cover all at once, and at the end of the lecture explained that he had not touched on three of the greatest diseases now prevalent.

Dr. Todd began by giving brief summaries of about ten case histories, covering a number of different diseases and situations. In these, he stressed the importance of the tests that were made in the laboratory, and the contribution they made toward correcting or curing the conditions. He mentioned typhoid fever, pneumonia, tuberculosis, amoebic dysentery, tumors, tetanus, and several other diseases, where both the diagnosis and prognoses had been materially aided, if not made entirely possible, through laboratory examinations of blood, etc. The doctor, he said, who tries to practice medicine without the aid of the laboratory is completely out of date, and considerably handicapped.

After the case histories, he explained a number of slides, illustrating the bacteria or germs in rabies, malaria, amoebic dysentery, typhoid, and the parasites in hookworm and other such parasitic diseases. He illustrated methods of blood transfusions, making slides to determine with what type of blood a transfusion may be made. He explained the different types of blood, and how they were used to test heredity.
