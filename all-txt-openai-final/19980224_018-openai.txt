### Bench player is Southern’s top sixth man

For Ben Ebong, enthusiasm was never the problem. The redshirt junior’s passion and eagerness to better the men’s basketball team
were never in doubt. But early this season, controlling that enthusiasm was sometimes an issue.

#### THE SPARK
“Ben has a tremendous sense of charisma and enthusiasm and he has really learned to harness that,” said coach Bob
McKillop. “To get the rustiness out of his game took tremendous intelligence and discipline on his part.”

All of that hard work is starting to show. Over the last seven games, Ebong has averaged 12.6 points —
posting double digits in each of those contests — and seven rebounds, while shooting close to 60 percent from the
field. He’s averaging nine points and six boards this season and has recorded two double-doubles.

“He is certainly putting up the statistics to earn a starting nod on many teams,” said McKillop. “But what he
does coming off of the bench makes him more valuable for us.”

And that is to provide a spark plug in the Wildcats’ line-up.

“I guess it just comes naturally,” said the 6-foot-6, 220-pound forward. “I’m a very emotional person and I play with
a lot of emotion. I want to have fun on the court, but at the same time I want to
do whatever this team needs for us to win.”

Recently, Ebong has done both. One of the few Wildcats — not only on this year’s team, but in Davidson
basketball history — who can bring the crowd to its feet with a monster jam, Ebong takes full advantage of
his dunking ability. Just ask league nemesis Appalachian St. Twice this year, an Ebong dunk lifted the Wildcats over the
Mountaineers.

In the teams’ first meeting Jan. 31 in Boone, Ebong found a seam in the Appalachian zone in the game’s
final minute, took a feed from Ali Ton, and gave Davidson the lead for good with a thunderous slam. And
in the Wildcats’ convincing 68-58 victory Thursday, Ebong thwarted a second-half Mountaineer rally by driving the lane and serving a
facial to Mountaineer Marshall Phillips.

“If that’s what it takes to make this team better, that’s what I will do,” explained Ebong. “I take pride
in anything I do on the court. I like playing the part of a utility man.”

It is that kind of attitude that kept Ebong going through the rough times — like last season, his redshirt
year, when Ebong watched games not wearing his trademark No. 42, but rather sporting a suit and suspenders on the
bench. Although Ebong practiced with the team a year ago, he was unable to compete in games.

“Myself and the coaches did not look at it as an off year,” said the Omaha, Neb., native. “It was
sometimes hard not being the focal point, but the coaches stuck with me and the focus was always on getting
better.”

Coming into the season, the expectations were high for Ebong. Despite playing in only 23 games — the equivalent of
not even one full season — in his first two collegiate years and averaging just over four points, some thought
Ebong would be the successor to last year’s leading scorer and all-conference performer Narcisse Ewodo.

“The expectations were very high for Ben,” said McKillop. “In his first two seasons with us, he was a role
player. This year, he comes in with a high label, and when he didn’t perform at the level people expected,
it was tough to deal with.”

But like the Wildcats, Ebong has bounced back.

“It just took a while for me to get back mentally,” said Ebong. “It was just a matter of time
until I found my comfort zone and settled down.”

Having rewritten his personal record book this season, the goal now for Ebong?

“What it has always been: to get better every day and learn something from every game.”

Pressure is not something new to the men’s basketball team this season.

“Pressure has been an experience this team has faced all season long,” said coach Bob McKillop.

#### The History
“From the first game at Duke to the expectation of this team winning the conference championship, this team has faced
challenge after challenge.”

And undoubtedly, the upcoming challenge is the biggest. This weekend, the Wildcats — 17-9, 13-2, North Division champions, and the
No. 1 seed — will fight for an NCAA berth in the Southern Conference tournament in Greensboro. Win the tournament,
advance to the Big Dance. Lose the tournament, go home and ponder a failed season.

“It all comes down to winning three straight basketball games,” said McKillop. “That is the reality and the nature of
Division I basketball at this level, so the pressure is on everybody.”

It has been 12 years since Davidson made the coveted NCAA field of 64.Since 1994, years in which the Wildcats
undoubtedly had the talent to win the tourney and automatically go to the NCAAs, the league tourney has caused nothing
but heartache for Davidson fans. In 1994’s conference championship in Asheville, Brandon Williams missed a shot at the buzzer, as
Chattanooga nipped the Wildcats 65-64. After a subpar regular season in the 1994-95 season, Davidson fell to Western Carolina 78-74
in the quarterfinals. And then there is the sad story of past failures adding to pressure.

Coach Bob McKillop and the Wildcats hope to erase past failures in the conference tournament. Two years ago, after cruising
to an unblemished 14-0 conference mark and winning the first two games of the league tournament, the Wildcats were shocked
in the final by Western. Last year, Davidson was stopped in the semifinals by eventual Sweet 16 participant Chattanooga, 77-70.

“We’re right there every time,” said guard Davor Halbauer. “It becomes frustrating to come so close and lose. It’s about
time to go through the tourney, take that step forward, and make the NCAAs.”

With the tournament only a few days away, Davidson again finds itself as the favorite. And while the pressure will
be there, it has been there all season for the Wildcats. Perhaps the demanding non-conference schedule McKillop and his staff
put together, which caused such frustration early on, will give the Wildcats that killer instinct they lacked in the postseason
in the recent past. Said McKillop: “The only way to get good at handling pressure is by handling pressure.”

The fine line between a successful and failed season will again be determined this weekend.

Failures? Perhaps because of the early-season failures? “That’s kept us grounded in reality,” said senior 1,000-point scorer Mark Donnelly after
the Wildcats’ critical win Thursday over Appalachian St. “Because of all the losses we suffered early, no matter what we
do now, we’ll never be able to live up to preseason expectations.”

And what was seen as catastrophic in the second week of January now looks like something of a blessing in
disguise. With the prospect of a ranking or upsets over national powerhouses long gone, the Wildcats shifted their focus to
simply getting better every day.

“I don’t think there’s any pressure,” Ben Ebong said. “It’s just a matter of having fun. If we just forget
about the scoreboard, we’ll be successful. If we come in loose and play hard and play with a lot of
confidence, that should carry us.”

Said coach Bob McKillop: “We fell, and fell dramatically, and hit rock bottom in the second week of January.” And
now? “We've been playing passionately,” the ninth-year head coach responded.

Indeed. A greater focus on pounding the ball inside, which started most notably in the Wildcats’ first win over Appalachian
Jan. 31 in Boone, has (1) made the most of Davidson’s individual talents inside, and (2) created more open looks
for the team’s shooters on the perimeter. The result? Stephen Marshall, who came up with a behemoth 20-point, 14-rebound effort
in the season opener Nov. 20 at Duke and essentially disappeared for the next six weeks, has become a night-in-night-out
scoring and rebounding presence in the paint.

Ebong has scored in double figures in nine of the 12 games since the VMI loss, including a team-high and
career-best 17 points in the pivotal come-from-behind win Jan. 17 at Furman. Landry Kosmalski has shown flashes—extended flashes—of the form
that enabled him to garner Southern Conference Freshman-of-the-Year honors last season. Chadd Holmes, perhaps the best pure talent in the
group, has made the most of his minutes. His 16 points in only 15 minutes at Boone were instrumental.

And Davidson’s defense, which spurred last year’s successful late-season stint, has worked similar magic. In four of the final five
regular season games, the Wildcats held their opponents to under 40 percent shooting from the floor, as the squad has
confused teams by constantly switching its defensive sets. With Saturday’s victory, Davidson now boasts a phenomenal 22-1 record in February
games over the past three seasons, the one loss coming last Feb. 3 against Marshall in Huntington, W.Va.

“Our success in February has been extraordinary,” McKillop confirmed. “It’s just a natural progression. Our players practice so hard and
play so hard. But the success I want to see is success in March.”

And if Davor Halbauer’s mentality is any indication, confidence is no problem at all. “We've been ready since late January
when we started to play better,” the starting guard said Saturday. “I’m sure we’re going to reach our best next
week in Greensboro. We’ve got to take what's ours. It’s about time for us to take the next step forward
and go to the NCAAs.”

Point guard Ali Ton, who topped the Southern Conference in assists for the second straight year, leads the Wildcats into
league tournament play. The team’s quarterfinal game is Friday at noon in Greensboro.
