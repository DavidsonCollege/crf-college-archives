rest and the Blue to dance while the Yellows were recuperating, then for the Yellows to take over for another spell, etc. I fell into the Yellow category. As I have already stated, this was to be a square dance with such jingles as:

We docey-doe
Heel and toe,
With her heel
Upon my toe.

My accomplice upon the floor was Eunice Bycupps. She might be described as — CENSORED — (Note: We feel that when Al Capp publishes the picture of “Lena the Hyena,” there will be a striking resemblance to Eunice. Ed.)

A few boys came up to Eunice and, patting her on the head, called her Polio, but I reminded them that Polio was a dog and that Eunice insisted upon standing on all fours only when we were not dancing. I finally got my break — after grappling with something (I call j mines to last me for the rest of the night) we sallied forth onto the floor for more rug-cutting with:

“Swing your partner,
To and fro,
If not enough
Give ’er some mo’.”

The gym where the corn-fed melee took place was decorated with pennants of different colleges and universities. Upon noticing the red and black of Davidson flanking the flag of Queens, I was reminded of the recent swing hit, “Pickle in the Middle” (courtesy of Petrillo).

At 11:00 sharp the fiddles and their bass (not base) mother had seen their best hours of plucking, so their keepers packed them up in straw along with the blow jugs and started back to the farm. On arriving at Davidson about 12:00, we staggered to our respective rooms to take turns in bandaging our wounds and adjusting our first-aid splinters. However, we consider ourselves “worldly” men now and will go armed the next time with suits of armor and a twelve-gauge shotgun.

If a battered corpse is found in or around Davidson soon, please bury it immediately as the weather is still warm, and place a slab over the spot reading:

“All is done,
It was fun,
Did my best,
Eunice the rest.”

coming dance set. As yet, plans for the informal to be held on the night of the second, following the Davidson-W. and L. game, are incomplete. Music for the formal is to be by a band of national standing, but is as yet unannounced. Due to the inadequate facilities on the campus at the present time, faculty permission for holding such functions off-campus has been granted. This is to be in effect until dance facilities are available on the college campus, adequate to accommodate the students and their guests.

bition of moral force of character and of instincts to lead and to take an interest in his schoolmates; (4) physical vigor as shown by interest in outdoor sports or in other ways: “Some definite quality of distinction, whether in intellect, character or personality, or in any combination of them, is the most important requirement for a Rhodes Scholarship. Financial need does not constitute a special claim for consideration.

“There is no restriction on a Rhodes Scholar’s course of study. The University of Oxford offers about the same variety of instruction as any large American university. Rhodes Scholars are appointed for two years in the first instance, with a possibility of a third year for a man who has made a good record, and who presents a plan of study for that period satisfactory to his college and to the Rhodes Trustees.

“The stipend of the Rhodes Scholars will remain for the present at 400 pounds as it was before the war. Many Rhodes Scholars will receive an addition to this stipend through measures analogous to the GI Bill of Rights. The Trustees have voted that any Rhodes Scholar not in receipt of such an augmentation to his stipend will be granted during the year 1946 to 1947 a special allowance, bringing his total up to 500 pounds. In addition, Rhodes Scholars going to Oxford for the first time will receive from the Rhodes Trust a refund of one half of their steamship fare.”

Anyone interested in this scholarship may obtain information and application blanks from Dr. Vowles, who is the representative of Rhodes Scholarships at Davidson, from C. C. Walker, Esq., Wachovia Bank and Trust Company, Winston-Salem, N. C., Secretary of the Committee of Selection in North Carolina, or from Dr. Aydelotte at Princeton.
