**Hubbard, Trappey sworn in as Washington steps down**

Addressing members of SGA with a few final words, outgoing SGA president Charles Washington ’04 stepped down from his position last Thursday, making way for the recently elected Katharine Hubbard ’05.

“This organization has been the very definition of my life,” said Washington. “I am proud to leave the SGA an organized, efficient, and effective organization.”

After thanking many individuals that had helped him over the course of his SGA career, Washington then proceeded to swear in Hubbard. Hubbard then delivered an inaugural address that focused largely on continuing the efforts of Washington.

“I hope to continue to press for extending the pass-fail option along with putting a student on the board of trustees,” said Hubbard. She also stressed flexibility, resolving “to hear and respond to the demands of students.”

As a first act of business, Hubbard led in a lighthearted inauguration of new Vice President Francois Trappey ’06. Having no scheduled speech, Trappey chose to offer a short, informal address to the audience. His words centered on a dedication to his new position.

“We are looking for a focused transition of office with no vacuum,” Trappey later told the press. So far, it appears to have worked.

“It’s been a very smooth transition,” said Hubbard. “Both Charles and I have the same mentality towards running the SGA.”

Washington also encouraged a focus on “continuity” between the new administration and the last. “I really want to see them keep with some of the things we’ve been working on,” he said.

Washington plans to remain politically active as a student, providing a familiar voice of wisdom for the new administration. “I’m not going away,” he said.

Hubbard also encouraged outside involvement in the SGA. “I’m really excited and open to any suggestions,” she said. “Remember, SGA meetings are always open to the public.”

**SGA accomplishes five out of six of last year’s goals**

Newly-elected SGA president Katharine Hubbard ’05 reported that she was in the process of setting goals for next year, while outgoing president Charles Washington ’04 said that his administration had accomplished five of its six major goals for the year.

Hubbard said that she has a number of initiatives in mind, including increasing the number of computers and printers in the Union, getting a student on the Board of Trustees, and following up on current efforts to extend the pass/fail deadline and install cable in every dorm room.

During the remaining months of the semester, Hubbard will support a collaborative project at the Lake Campus with other student organizations, such as UCA, Union Board, and PCC. The proposal stems from the work of the Rides Committee.

Rhett Merrill ’04, SGA Treasurer, explained that organizers were considering a four-week program in April consisting of concerts, intramural sports, and open access to sailboats, canoes, and kayaks. Funding for the venture will have to come from the SGA through the Activities Tax Council, and possible co-sponsorships with the Union Board. In future years, money might come from the Improve Davidson Fund, a $10,000 account created to fund “unique ideas that contribute to improving student life overall.” The account was established one-and-a-half years ago.

Hubbard also plans to focus on increasing student participation in SGA. She said that SGA meetings and committees are open to all students, not just SGA members.

According to Washington, SGA has made great strides towards achieving its only unfinished goal, the extension of the pass/fail deadline. SGA submitted a resolution advocating an altered pass/fail policy to the Educational Policy Committee that considered the resolution at a recent meeting.

Washington said, “I actually sat in on that meeting, and they talked about [the resolution]. As far as I could tell, they weren’t opposed to it, and I felt like some of the members kind of thought it was a good idea.”

He added, “I think that that’s something that could be accomplished by the end of the semester, although it...”wouldn’t take effect until next semester,” Washington said. SGA expanded CatCard use off-campus, worked out an agreement to keep Belk Computer Lab open 24 hours a day, and improved its communication with the student body by establishing an SGA e-mail account.

Washington is particularly proud of SGA’s efforts to strengthen school spirit. He mentioned that SGA hosted a screening of the first men’s basketball game of the season in the 900 Room. The SGA also chartered buses to the Davidson-Chapel Hill men’s basketball game and e-mailed the fight song and alma mater to all students. “I think that that’s one [goal] we’ve done great with,” Washington said. “I think right now, we have a level of school spirit that’s uncommon to Davidson College.”

Merrill reported that SGA has used roughly half of its $12,900 budget for this fiscal year that ends at the conclusion of the semester. Since SGA spending usually increases in the spring, Merrill expects the projected budget to be “right on target.”

Proposal for later spring break passes
Final decision now lies with faculty board
By SARAH ROBINSON

In recent SGA meetings, debate has been raised over whether to push Spring Break back. The SGA voted in support of suggesting that the break be a week later for the 2005-06 school year. The suggestion will now go to the faculty board that will decide whether changing the break would be beneficial. New changes to the calendars will not affect students for a year after a new motion has passed.

Registrar Dr. Hansford Epes ’61 explained that the week is a “mid-semester break” in the middle of the term rather than in the spring. “Shortening the second half by a week, making the second half six and a half weeks long instead of seven and a half weeks long, wouldn’t help that wearying intensity at all,” said Epes.

For some students, the placement of break does not matter so much because there still would be a crunch time. Graham Honeycutt ’06 said, “The only real thing that I wish is that teachers would realize that all teachers put a test, paper, or midterm on the week before spring break and spread out their syllabus to take this into consideration.”

Others see the downside of not being able to enjoy warm weather while on break. Hanley Smith ’07 said, “I do feel that spring break is a tad early, especially because the weather doesn’t allow for much vacation and timing doesn’t coincide with the breaks of many friends.”

Nevertheless, with this year’s spring break approaching, some students have chosen to spend their free time going around the United States helping different charities. The alternative breaks program offers students opportunities to help the community and gain real experience dealing with real issues. This year, there are five alternative breaks that will be led by student leaders. The trips will take students to New Orleans, Immokalee, Soddy Daisy, Bridgeton, and Nashville.

Caitlin Kiley ’06 and Connor Mooney ’06 will lead students to New Orleans, where they will work in an AIDS clinic. They will help provide entertainment for the patients, as well as performing several maintenance jobs on site. Kiley hopes that the experience will “increase empathy for those with the illness and other terminal illnesses, and learning about oneself, others, and a little bit of New Orleans culture!”

Kendal Stewart ’06 and Adam Gerstenmier ’05 will lead their group to Immokalee, Florida. They will live in a homeless shelter called Friendship House and will help plan activities for children who come in after school. Stewart, who participated on the same trip last year, said that she “look[s] forward to interacting with the Hispanic community by volunteering for Immokalee Non-for-Profit Housing.”
