BINKS’S CHAPTER III: SOUR SECRET

THE WEIRD AND WONDERFUL WORLD OF AMBIVALENCE

AMBIVALENCE IS THAT BRAIN-IN-A-TAFFY-PULLING-MACHINE SENSATION YOU GET WHEN SEIZED BY SIMULTANEOUS AND CONTRADICTORY FEELINGS (SUCH AS ATTRACTION AND REPULSION) TOWARD
A PERSON (WHO IS PROBABLY GRIPPED BY THE SAME DESIRE TO SAY OR DO TWO OPPOSITE THINGS). IT'S PART OF
THE FUN OF BEING HUMAN, AND IF YOU'RE REALLY LUCKY, YOU CAN FIND SOMEONE TO SHARE YOUR MUTUAL AMBIVALENCE WITH
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

BY MATT GROENING

URGE TO FONDLE

VAGUELY BITTER MEMORIES

CARNAL DESIRE

REPULSIVE SORT OF WAY

OF THE WOMAN WHO DUMPED ME

NICE OVERBITE

SHE'S OUT TO TRAP ME

PLEASANT TINGLING BELOW THE WAIST

SUDDEN URGE TO MOVE TO
