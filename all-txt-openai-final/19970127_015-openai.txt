Abracadabra, Ali serves up Ton of assists

Ali’s assists

Pinpoint passer Ali Ton has been on a torrid assist run recently, picking up 31 in the last three games. A career-high 12 Wednesday vs. East Tenn. St. raised his season average to a hair under seven per game. It also vaulted Ton past Marshall’s Sidney Coles into the Southern Conference top spot and to 12th in the nation.

Why the sudden explosion? “He’s got people finishing shots, he’s got people catching his passes, he’s got people running to catch his passes, and he sees the court really well,” said coach Bob McKillop after the ETSU win. “That’s just Ali. He almost passes to a fault,” added Mark Donnelly, whose silky jumpers have played a big role in Ton’s assist totals.

“He’s absolutely incredible in what he sees. Sometimes we look at him like he’s crazy, but when he has nights like this, maybe we should stop looking at him so funny when he is trying to explain to us what he is trying to do.”

Still though, McKillop believes Ton has considerable room for improvement before he ultimately reaches his potential, pointing out that he often tries to do too much and not just make the simple, safer pass. “He’s a better see-er than a passer,” remarked the coach. “When he becomes a better passer, watch out.”

Younger Kosmalski making his own mark

Three days after running a feature article on him, The Observer called rookie Landry Kosmalski “Len” in the ETSU report. Such a slip could be viewed as a compliment, considering Len Kosmalski, Landry’s father, was a standout at Tennessee and went on to play for the Chicago Bulls and Kansas City Kings in the NBA.

But Kosmalski has made an immediate impact in his own right this season, creating an identity as a ruthless rebounder (7.8 per game, 3rd in the SC) and versatile, reliable scorer (12.8, 14th). His 18-point, 7-rebound performance against South Division leader UTC Jan. 18 prompted Mocs superstar Johnny Taylor to predict, “He’s going to tear this conference up.”

And after a 23-point, 10-rebound double-double in the App. St. loss, Mountaineers coach Buzz Peterson had nothing but praise for No. 40. “I was at Vanderbilt and he was a kid I wanted to recruit,” said the first-year coach who was an assistant at Vandy last season. “I thought he could help us in the SEC. I thought he was smart, he ran the floor awful hard, he had nice touch. To me, he’s one of the better freshmen in this league. I’ve always been a big Landry Kosmalski fan.”

But the humble and soft-spoken Kosmalski, who will routinely sacrifice his body for the team, taking charges and diving out of bounds for loose balls, always chooses to dwell on his few mistakes during postgame interviews rather than point out his many successes.

“Numbers-wise, I am playing well,” he said after the App. St. game. “But I know my defense is pathetic and I am not getting enough rebounds. That's what coach and I have been working on recently.”

As Donnelly said though, “He’s a big reason why we’re a lot better than people...”

Holmes breaks out of mini-slump

Coming into this season, one of the many questions facing the youthful Wildcats was how sophomore Chadd Holmes would perform in the pivot. As expected, the 6-9 Holmes has had his ups and downs, bad games and good games. But perhaps none more important than his 14-point, 8-rebound effort vs. ETSU. Going into the game against the Bucs, Holmes had posted only 9 points and 8 boards in his previous two contests combined. Wednesday’s outing was just what the doctor ordered: a severely-needed confidence boost.

“The big thing with Chadd is just believing in himself,” said Donnelly after the ETSU game. “Tonight he showed what he is capable of doing every night, in my opinion.”

“Chadd certainly stepped it up tonight with aggression,” said a pleased McKillop. “He sat down, he looked at film, he did a lot of soul-searching. There was a great deal of introspection on his part, and he made a determination that he is going to change. He’s not going to be passive. He’s not going to be put on his heels, and tonight he certainly instigated rather than retaliated. And that’s been a problem, he’s been the retaliator rather than the instigator.”

Tonight’s game should pose a challenging individual matchup for Holmes, as he goes up against The Citadel’s 7-foot shot-blocking extraordinaire, Kirill Misyuchenko.

Injury report

Stephen Marshall, who sprained his left ankle Jan. 18 vs. UTC, was in street clothes at App. St. and dressed for ETSU, but never played and was still walking with a noticeable limp. But the 6-8 forward, a vital body off the bench in the frontcourt rotation, is set to return tonight against The Citadel.

“I believe he’ll be ready,” said McKillop on Wednesday. “(Team doctor) Scott Applegate has done such a great job for us throughout the year, and I’m sure he’ll have him ready for the Citadel game.”

Donnelly suffered a cut below his right eye late in the first half at App. St., which required stitches and caused him to miss some of the second half. But the injury obviously did not affect his shot at all on Wednesday, as he made six threes and shot 10-for-12 from the floor. The only worry now is that the five-day layoff between ETSU and tonight’s contest in Charleston, S.C., will cool off his stroke.

In the zone

McKillop used a 2-3 zone defense in both games this week - very uncharacteristic for a coach who preaches tough man-to-man pressure.

“We did it three years ago and that was about the last time we used it,” McKillop said Wednesday. “We've been forced to use it this year. We’ve been forced to make adjustments.”

The zone forces teams to shoot the long-range jumper, and while App. St.’s Tige Darner burned the Wildcats Monday with eight threes, it worked well against ETSU, as the Bucs shot just over 30% from beyond the arc.
