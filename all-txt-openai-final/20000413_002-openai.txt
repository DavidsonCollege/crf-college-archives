**Forum continues South Carolina flag debate**
**By Richard Vinson, Staff Writer**

On Wednesday, April 5, the SGA presented a proposal regarding the Confederate Battle Flag in Columbia, South Carolina to a
packed Homeroom. The Flag Forum gave students, faculty, and other participants the chance to discuss issues surrounding this controversial symbol’s
presence on the South Carolina State House. In addition, SGA members entertained suggestions on which direction to steer the Davidson
College community now.

Reactions on Wednesday night were mixed. Debate was generally lively and open, though there was some obvious hesitance to speak
openly and directly in support of the Confederate Flag. Still, most agreed that the forum was insightful and effective. SGA
Senator and flag committee member Allison Perry said she felt that the gathering was generally helpful. “We [the committee members]
got some good feedback... and at least it got people talking about it.” Professor Scott Denham of the German Department,
also in attendance, agreed that the forum presented most of the salient issues, “in a civil manner.” Moreover, he praised
the SGA for taking an active stance on this particular question. “I think the resolution is a good thing, if
for no other reason than to foster thought and discussion on campus.”

This forum came in response to the SGA’s passage of a resolution presented by the flag committee on March 28.
This resolution committed the school to “actively support” the efforts to “relocate” the Confederate Battle Flag from its perch atop
the State House in Columbia. No action was specified in the text of the resolution. Partly in hopes of solidifying
student support for this objective, and partly in an attempt to sound out the campus community on what kind of
action would best achieve that support, the SGA extended the invitation to students and faculty to meet and to let
their views be known.

First and foremost, participants struggled to define the flag as a symbol. Some contended that its use by racist groups
has irrevocably branded the Confederate Flag as an image of hatred, bigotry, and terror. Professor Brenda Flanagan, Department of English,
noted that she, upon coming to the South, perceived the flag as an instrument of intimidation against African Americans. Others
maintained that it is an expression of respect for those fallen in defense of a cause and an attempt to
preserve “Southern heritage.” Nevertheless, some asserted that the intent of the flag is irrelevant, as oppression and intimidation are realized
in the personal experience of those who suffer under them.

Second, those present gave numerous political and legalistic arguments on both sides of the issue. Among the most notable, one
student explained that while the Constitution does protect the freedom of expression for individuals, it does not do so for
bodies such as the Government of the State of South Carolina. By flying the Confederate Flag, the government is implicitly
espousing a particular political view, one that is offensive to a great number of people. Another countered that the South
Carolina Legislature is the only organ with the authority to keep or maintain the flag. In other words, “outsiders” should
mind their own business. Junior Cashion Drolet took a similar tone. Speaking from the perspective of a South Carolinian, she
said that the perception in her home state is that people are meddling in their internal affairs. However, many reaffirmed
their conviction that South Carolina’s business is Davidson’s business due to geographic proximity, the large numbers of students and alumni
from South Carolina, and participation with four South Carolina schools in the Southern Conference.

Third, a few participants made use of historical interpretations to justify their beliefs. One noted that the Battle Flag was
first flown over the State House in 1962 as a protest against federally mandated desegregation. Hence, in this particular context,
its purpose and its message are clearly “defiant” and “racist,” said Professor Denham. One visitor diverted the debate even further
back into history and claimed that the flag was a protest motivated by years of economic and social imperialism by
the North against the South. Mr. Hugh Martin of Sebastopol, California voiced the opinion that the Battle Flag is an
oppressed people’s quest for a symbol of their identity, though his comments met with some skepticism.

Perry acknowledged that the discussion of issues was important, but lamented the fact that students did not present more suggestions
for action. “I was hoping to get more original ideas,” she admitted. Of the possibilities considered, one in particular met
with apparent favor. Professor Ralph Levering, Department of History, suggested that the SGA send a similar proposal to the faculty.
He thought that the possibility of uniting the entire college behind this issue was one worth considering. Sophomore Nowell Zimmerman,
based on his experience with Amnesty International, cited the “power of letter-writing,” as an effective means of achieving political change.
Perry was reluctant to say definitively what the next step will be but restated the SGA’s commitment to explore all
options.

**Davidson Partnership comes together for families, children**
**Press Release by Bill Giduz**

A grant from the Duke Endowment brought them together in January 1999, and now a group of agencies and institutions
in the town of Davidson charged with improving the welfare of children and families is finally beginning to feel like
the “partnership” of its title. The Duke Endowment is a Charlotte, N.C.-based foundation with more than $3 billion in assets
which benefits health care institutions, churches, and four colleges in the Carolinas. In 1998 the endowment invited Davidson College to
apply for the grant as part of a new foundation outreach toward...children and needy families. The college was successful in
applying for $255,000 of funding, which it administers, for the first year of a possible three-year collaboration with local service
agencies which had no prior history of working closely together. In evaluating their progress thus far, the six original members
of the “Davidson Partnership for Children and Families” admit that learning to balance their new corporate responsibility with their pre-existing
individual missions has been challenging. Monthly meetings and extensive reports for the partnership have placed additional duties on administrators who
had their hands full with the work of their separate organizations. “Getting these agencies together at the same table regularly
was something that had never happened before, and it has taken patience and effort to learn to work together,” explained
George Guise, partnership grant coordinator. “Now, though, I think we’ve overcome those growing pains and created a mission that fits.”

The mission, as members recently finalized it, is “to strengthen the impact and effectiveness of those organizations that serve children
and families in the Davidson community.” That broad statement emerged from specific initial partnership goals to increase the percentage of
students who graduate from high school and go on to higher education, decrease teen pregnancy and drug abuse, improve access
to social services, and heighten the sense of membership in the community. Partners used the first-year funding for child care
scholarships, after-school tutoring programs, health care services, substance abuse counseling, transportation, community dinners, and parenting and computer classes.

While proceeding with those efforts, the partners also realized a need to expand their membership to encompass other local entities
with equal interests in strong families and healthy children. They have therefore created a partnership advisory board and recently issued
invitations to the town government, ministerial association, the YMCA, and parents of children involved in partnership programs to take a
seat at the partnership table. Mary Fox, director of the Davidson-Cornelius Day Care Center, noted, “When you get all these
people around the table, we make connections. In my dealing with preschool children, I may realize something that points to
a need these same children will have in a few years, and someone else in the partnership can begin programming
to address that.”

The Duke Endowment grant is awarded year-by-year for up to three years and will expire in 2002. Looking ahead, partnership
agencies recognize the need for self-sufficiency but also believe now that funding won’t be the most important challenge they face.
Tom Shandley, Dean of Students at Davidson College and chair of the partnership, said, “As we expand to other organizations,
we believe that our primary need will not be funding, but will be communication between all groups so that we
effectively serve the youth of Davidson from ‘diaper to diploma.’”

Shandley said the value of communication became evident six months ago during a meeting at which partners lamented the need
for a middle school tutoring program to supplement the existing elementary school tutoring program. “Because we had representatives from the
Boys and Girls Club, the school system, and our Davidson College service office together, we figured out how to do
it in a matter of two hours,” he said.

About 80 students from Davidson College have provided the volunteer energy necessary to fuel many of the partnership programs, tutoring
in the after-school programs, assisting at Friday night Boys and Girls Club social events, and staffing community dinners. In addition
to the college and the day care center, original grant partners were the Davidson Youth Activity Center (now the Boys
and Girls Club of Our Towns), the Ada Jenkins Community Center, Davidson Presbyterian Church, and Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools.

The partnership funds have supported its agencies in a number of ways during the first year. The Davidson Cornelius Day
Care Center, which enrolls 45 students and received $31,200 of grant money, was able to provide staff training to meet
requirements for new state certification, and to grant scholarships to 15 students who didn’t qualify for other assistance. The Boys
and Girls Club of Our Towns (BGCOT) was founded in 1996 as the Davidson Youth Activity Center to provide a
safe and constructive environment for middle school-aged youth. The board voted in 1998 to affiliate with the national Boys and
Girls Club, and an executive director was hired last summer. The BGCOT absorbed a new middle school, after-school tutoring program,
and averaged 10 students per day for two hours per day participating in its programs. Part of the BGCOT’s $69,900
portion of the grant financed its new executive director, while other funds supported 11 weeks of Friday night programs, leadership
workshops, and field trips.

The Ada Jenkins Community Center received funds for its after-school program for 31 elementary school students, a Parish Nurse program,
substance abuse counseling, computer training, and a program in parenting skills and family counseling. The most widely acclaimed successes of
the partnership during its first year were two community dinners, which brought a large number of citizens together for a
program relating to parenting and family concerns. Congressman Mel Watt spoke at the first one about the importance of a
strong home life, and Loraine Vega from the United Way talked at the second occasion about how that organization works
to strengthen families.

Now that the partnership has evolved beyond its birthing pains, partners hope that the second year will be even more
action-oriented. As other entities join the partnership, there will be more opportunities to identify and help children and families who
need it. The partnership plans to sponsor more parent education workshops, the Boys & Girls Club will move into permanent
quarters and expand its after-school tutoring and recreational programs for middle school students, and the Ada Jenkins Center will add
new initiatives. Bonnie Brown, director of the Ada Jenkins Center, said, “Sharing of information is really valuable. So often one
organization can assist another in doing its job, and that’s the biggest value so far. It’s important to focus on
what we can do together. As a rule of thumb today, you should never think about doing something on your
own.”
