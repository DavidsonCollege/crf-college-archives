Victorian low-life play to arrive for Parent's Weekend

By STEPHEN CEFALU
Staff Writer

The Threepenny Opera, a mainstage musical production presented by the Davidson College Theatre Department, opens Wednesday, October 23, at 8 p.m. in the Hodson Hall auditorium of the Cunningham Fine Arts Building. The production’s 23-member Davidson student cast is under the direction of Theater Professor Joe Gardner. Ron Higdon is both the set designer and technical director of the production.

Written in 1928 by the renowned German playwright Bertolt Brecht, The Threepenny Opera is a witty comedy that employs theatrical parody and social satire in keeping its audience thoroughly entertained. Specifically, it is the story of the cunning and vicious “gentleman thief” Macheath (A.K.A. “Mac the Knife”) whose exploits bring him into direct confrontation with authorities of Victorian London. The social commentary Brecht includes within this very humorous production holds great relevance for modern-day society. The riveting musical score, which was composed by the great jazz artist Kurt Weill, includes such songs as “Pirate Jenny” and the most famous “Mack the Knife.” Brad Griffin (‘95) serves as musical director and conductor, while Diane Thornton of Davidson’s Music Department provides vocal direction for production cast members.

The 8 p.m. evening productions of The Threepenny Opera will continue from opening night through Saturday, October 26; there will be a Sunday matinee performance at 2 p.m. on October 27. Tickets are $5 for students and $8 for the general public. Call 892-234 for reservations.

“Greatest jazz pianist of our time” to play at Davidson

By JIM WILLIAMS
Associate Arts and Living Editor

Of all of the wonderful musical ensembles on campus, perhaps the jazz ensemble offers the most room for creativity in performances. This Saturday, October 26, at 9 p.m. in Love Auditorium, the jazz ensemble, under the direction of Dr. Bill Lawing, will perform with the Loonis McGlohan Trio and Mike Campbell, a jazz singer from Los Angeles. According to Dr. Lawing, Loonis McGlohan, the group’s leader, is “the greatest jazz pianist of our time.” In his 70s, McGlohan has performed and recorded with every contemporary great jazz performer. The concert will begin with the Davidson College Jazz Ensemble, then proceed to a performance by the trio and Mike Campbell, and will end with a joint performance of the jazz ensemble and the trio.
