**Spongetones, Bongos, Nashvillians In Roundup**

By STEVE MANK

Hey kids, albums have hit another lull. Seems as though Christmas is just too far back and summer’s too far away, so once again, it’s time for another E.P. round-up in which those dandy little five-song discs, too often overlooked, are reviewed.

**Torn Apart**

The Spongetones’ E.P., *Torn Apart*, is an excellent follow-up to the band’s highly touted debut L.P., *Beat Music*. The Spongetones played some of the E.P.’s featured songs at the homecoming concert, but here the band sounds far better thanks to the wonders of studio magic.

The group is an unadulterated copy of the Beatles, but surprisingly, this does not work against them. On the contrary, the Spongetones have just as much energy as their mentors and come frighteningly close to being almost as good. Every now and then one would swear the combo could make a fortune by claiming to find long-lost Beatles tunes.

One of the most noteworthy tracks is “Shock Therapy,” which sends the mind reeling with its flanged vocals, pounding drums, and bizarre guitar solos. Incidentally, if that clapping on “Shock Therapy” sounds familiar, it should: that’s the always helpful R.E.M. offering their services on yet another album by an up-and-coming local band.

**Numbers With Wings**

*Numbers With Wings*, by the Bongos, was released last year and is one of the band’s better efforts to date. The title track epitomizes the band’s nouveau-dance/psychedelia and is, in fact, so good that it inevitably warrants a second playing.

“Sweet Blue Cage” is also very good, with its almost contemplative acoustic guitars acting as a lilting backdrop to the biting electrics. (By the way, the band does in fact use bongos which is kind of noteworthy, that being their name.)

**The Young Nashvillians**

This disc is from a band up Tennessee way called The Young Nashvillians. The E.P., cleverly titled *The Young Nashvillians Are Here*, is a very sundry collection of sometimes whimsical songs that reflects a side of the human psyche that many of us are afraid to admit exists.

Of special note is “Amelia,” about that famous pilot who “flying cross the ocean / she got a notion that something had gone wrong,” and “Eagle Man,” the story of one “bodacious beast.”

But the main reason for purchasing *The Young Nashvillians Are Here* is that The Young Nashvillians don’t spread their songs out. Rather, they put ’em all on one side and, to the satisfaction of innumerable fans, sign the other.
