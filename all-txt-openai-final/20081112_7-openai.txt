Tough schedule ahead for women

The women’s basketball team officially opens up its 2008-09 campaign this weekend, competing in a tournament at Winthrop. After dominating
Mars Hill College 75-48 in an exhibition last Sunday, the ’Cats set their sights on a thrilling schedule this season.

Last year, the team graduated a trio of dynamite senior guards. Head coach Annette Watts understands that “the key will
be how quickly we can fill those wing spots that graduated.” Already, she has shifted Mercedes Robinson ’09 to the
three guard spot “to give her the quickness and versatility to do some things.” As one of only two seniors
on the team, Robinson is expected to assume a key leadership role. Last season, Robinson was named to the All-SoCon
first team, averaging nearly 13 points and eight rebounds per game. What stands out most is her consistency, as she
knocked down over half of her shots last year and hit an impressive 45.2 percent from behind the arc. She
recently earned a spot on the preseason All-SoCon team.

Robinson will be flanked at the captain position by Mandy Halbersleben ’09, Alex Thompson ’10, and Kelly Gardner ’11. The
squad will rely heavily on their energy to fill the void left by the class of 2008, but Watts is
by no means worried. She deems the issue “not a problem at all, because the two seniors we do have
are very strong leaders.” As the winningest coach in Davidson history, boasting a record of 118-88, Watts is enthusiastic. Finishing
no lower than third in the conference over the past four years, she expects to keep the streak running.

Ranked third in the conference by preseason polls, the 'Cats look to take on their lofty expectations with a tough
schedule. “I certainly didn’t do this little team any favors by the schedule,” Watts said. “But I’m a firm believer
that if you play a tough non-conference schedule, you'll be ready when conference comes.” Over the next few weeks, the
’Cats will develop a clear view of where they stand in the league. “We could come out of our non-conference
games with a very good record, or not a very good record but having learned a ton. I’m open for
either of those.” Watts grinned, “Though I like the first better than I do the second.”

If the Mars Hill game is any indication, Thompson and Robinson will dominate the scoring columns this year. They dropped
24 and 20 points, respectively. Halbersleben helps out Robinson down low in the rebound category, along with Julia Paquette ’10.
Up top, Ashley Lax ’11 and Monica Laune ’10 partner with Thompson to provide the assists from the wing positions.
Where the team lacks in seniors, it makes up for it with a talented bench. Watts played nine of her
players for more than 10 minutes each in Sunday’s victory; the bench players scored 16.

Throughout the non-conference schedule, the ’Cats will face a disadvantage in size against their opponents. Within the conference, the issue
becomes speed. “We’re not blazingly quick, but we like to pride ourselves here at Davidson, that we are very smart,”
Watts said. “We try to outthink people — anticipate that next pass, anticipate that next move.” The size and athleticism
of their opposition will require utmost defensive focus. Thus far, the Cats have showed it in the Mars Hill exhibition.
In the coming weeks, crashing the boards and playing lights-out defense will even take precedence over offense. “I do not
expect those players in those wing spots, other than Mercedes, to have a tremendous role in scoring,” Watts said. “If
they do, it’s great. But I’m looking for defense out of that position, and I’m looking for rebounding. Those are
the two main things that we lost.”

With March already in everyone’s eyes, the next few months will showcase both high expectations, especially from Robinson, and new
displays of talent from the young team. Watts told her team, “All that means is that you’ve got a big
target on your back. You’ve got to wear that target proudly and yet know what it’s all about — it’s
about teamwork.” The men’s team electrified the nation last spring—will this be the women’s year to shine? Whatever the finish,
the ’Cats believe they’ve finally received the attention they deserve from other teams. “The respect is here,” Watts said. “We’re
not the little kids now that you could beat on. Now from the tip to the end, they’re going to
have to play us hard.”

**Men’s squad ranked no. 20**

“It’s like perfume I guess; it smells nice but no one would want to drink it,” said men’s basketball coach
Bob McKillop after considering Davidson’s top 20 ranking in the preseason ESPN/USA Today Coaches Poll and the preseason Associated Press
poll. McKillop simply means that while the Davidson basketball program is finally getting much-deserved recognition, it’s not enough just to
be highly touted at the beginning of the season. Certainly, finishing the job in late March and early April is
the goal for this year’s team after last year’s epic run which came up just one jump shot short of
sending the eventual national champions back to Lawrence, Kan. and propelling the Wildcats to the Final Four for the first
time in school history.

Entering this season, the Wildcats are returning with the sensation of the NCAA Tournament playing a different position with a
new role. Stephen Curry ’10, who carried the ’Cats last year with his sweet shooting touch and play-making ability, has
been asked to switch positions from shooting guard to point guard this season. The position isn’t completely new to him
as he ran the point during high school. The advantage of this position change is that the ball will be
in his hands on virtually every trip down the court. The difference, of course, is that instead of working to
free himself for an open shot, he will now look to create more opportunities for his teammates while also searching
for the opportunity to work his magic in the lane or pull up from three-point land. This position change was
also due to the graduation of Jason Richards ’08, who led the country in assists last year. Other losses due
to graduation include Thomas Sander ’08 and Boris Meno ’08. These big men provided a presence in the post that
allowed Davidson to compete with the likes of Wisconsin, Georgetown, and Kansas last year, teams all known for their dominance
in the paint. Looking to fill those roles are Steve Rossiter ’10 and Andrew Lovedale ’09. Their abilities to grab
rebounds and assert themselves physically will play a large part in Davidson’s success this year. Additionally, Bryant Barr ’10 and
Brendan McKillop ’11 will be major factors in filling the slot as a spot-up shooter beside Curry this season.

After last year’s domination of the Southern Conference, the ’Cats are expecting to continue their winning ways and hope to
again go undefeated through the SoCon. The out-of-conference schedule, however, will pose several key tests for the Wildcats and will
serve as a measuring stick for the team to compare itself with other more competitive conferences. Some of these games
include a possible showdown with Oklahoma in Norman, Okla. on Nov. 18, N.C. State on Dec. 6 in Charlotte, West
Virginia on Dec. 9 in Madison Square Garden, Purdue on Dec. 20 in Indiana, and finally Duke on Jan. 7
in Cameron Indoor Stadium. The most intriguing of these matchups is the one which will take place in Krzyzewskiville as
the Wildcats hope to ring in the New Year with a victory over the Blue Devils who are expected to
compete for the coveted ACC title this year. Duke will provide a great test for the Wildcats as they are
currently ranked fifth in the ESPN/USA Today Coaches Poll and eighth in the Associated Press Poll. The Cameron Crazies will
also supply a hostile environment which will leave fans, coaches, and players perceiving this game as one that should be
played in early spring rather than early January.

The bottom line is Davidson basketball is back and everybody across the nation has reason to pay attention. Davidson has
no shot at being a Cinderella story this year because we are on the map and other large and highly
respected programs are taking notice. “We can’t sneak up on anyone anymore, so we will see the opposing team’s best
shot and have to be as consistent as possible the entire season,” said Curry. With expectations that can’t soar any
higher, the great burden of pressure to prove that last year wasn’t a fluke rests upon the team’s shoulders. While
March is still far away, the anticipation is building daily with the hope that last year’s success will not just
be repeated but surpassed. The goal is the Final Four, and the fantastical dream is to watch the ’Cats partake
in one of the richest traditions in sports: the sacred cutting down of the nets.
