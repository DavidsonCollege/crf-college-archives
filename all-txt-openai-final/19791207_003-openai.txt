Draft registration forum draws 200

By ROY FULLER
Staff Writer

Approximately 200 students attended a forum on draft registration Monday. The forum, sponsored by NC-PIRG, consisted of two speeches in favor of reinstating draft registration and two speeches against.

Religion Professor Samuel Maloney, the first speaker, felt the real question is whether we need registration, not whether we want it. He gave several reasons for his support of draft registration. First, Maloney noted that experts feel that there will be little warning before the next war. Registration would allow more immediate troops, which Maloney believes will be vital for strength in conventional warfare. According to Maloney, the deficiencies in the volunteer and reserve armies are two more reasons that registration should be reinstituted. Maloney said he gives the volunteer army a “C” grade since they have lowered standards, and he pointed out the limited effectiveness of the reserve forces. Given the strength of the Soviet Union, Maloney stated, “the best guard against war is strength, not weakness.” Maloney concluded that since “the nature of man is not inherently good,” one should not idealistically think war will never happen.

Philosophy Professor Lance Stell was the first to speak against the reinstitution of draft registration. From an ethical viewpoint, Stell argued that human beings have rights which are moral.Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

Restraints on even those laws that men make. Stell stated, "Compulsory service is wrong... and all instances of it are illegitimate." According to Stell, the draft is not only immoral but unconstitutional. He contended that Congress cannot force citizens to serve in the army because the thirteenth amendment forbids involuntary servitude. Stell added that compulsory registration is also unconstitutional because it violates fourteenth amendment rights of equality by discriminating by age and sex. The draft discriminates mainly, a loss of liberty, and a loss of life. The most important social duty of the government to the people is to protect the country from attack. He maintained draft registration is necessary to fulfill this obligation. Like Maloney, Phelps suggested that lack of manpower and the declining quality of present recruits are reasons why draft registration is vital. Phelps concluded that serving in the military is the opportunity for young Americans "to pay back the debt for the liberty that life has given to each of us."

The final speaker, Steve Sumerford of the War Resisters' League, said that the draft is un-American. He said that historically the United States has not favored conscription and has had a volunteer army for over four-fifths of its history. In closing, Sumerford said draft registration is against the basic American beliefs of liberty, justice, and peace. After Sumerford's speech, there was a question and answer session. Because of the forum's format, no time was left for the Dread to respond.
