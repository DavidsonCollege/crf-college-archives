DELTA KAPPA
(Continued From Page Two)

PM, and hot and cold running soap-operas. Many loyal and enthusiastic DKs were seen early last Friday morning out to cheer the big team off to the William and Mary game. Conspicuously absent was Morpheus Morris — however, he redeemed himself by standing at attention beside the bed while Dixie was played — then he crawled back into the sack. Brothers Williams, Dietrick, Goodman, Fesperman, and Richard composed a good section of the cheering section at the Norfolk game. Goodman's date was cheering for W. and M. and from the reports concerning her ability to talk, for the first time in his life, he couldn't be heard. He has been frustrated ever since.

DKs initial venture onto the intramural field resulted in a complete victory — for the Kappa Alphas. That's all right, though, our team is red hot (from trying to catch the other team) and we expect to see a great improvement in the games to follow. Notable performances were turned in by Pledges Alcorn, Beck, and Morton, while brothers Brown, Carr, Clark, and Butt gave a good account of themselves also. What's the matter, Calhoun, Homecoming isn’t even here yet!

BETA THETA PI
On this first weekend the Betas are right back on the road as usual, and having “much fun.” Brothers Boyd and Turner distinguished themselves on the gridiron against Elon, and no doubt Wooglin smiled down approvingly. Slug looks good on that water-bucket, too. Brother Kirkpatrick sallied over to Salisbury this weekend and entertained himself, while Brothers C. and H. Neisler, Fulton, Richardson, McLean, Alexander, Williams, and Pledge Brother Maner went over to UNC to see the “Choo-Choo” game. Brothers “Hots” Yocum, “Head” Murphy motored up to Winston-Salem to give some of the luckier girls a thrill this weekend. Brother Schmidt was seen reportedly with a girl at some rowdier spots. Lover-boy Edwards (S) Sundayed in Rock Hill with Gismo. Some of the embryo sons of Wooglin roared into the annual affair at Queens, and at last report, all have returned to the ranks safely.

PHI GAMMA DELTA
With rushing season over, the islanders have settled back into their regular rut once more. Orchids go to the following: Brothers French and Blanks for superior rushing, Brothers Jenkins and Vance for their kitchen work, and Frances Lazenby for the seventeen girls she rounded up for the party with girls. This year’s pledge class is definitely the most promising looking bunch of rookies ever signed. Tom Jackson has been chosen by his fellow pledges as president of the pledge class. Brothers Malony and Larson are handling the coaching duties, Brother Haller has been voted “the most likely to be a crooked politician” award and is definitely the most unforgettable Pledge. He's got the best snow line heard in these parts in years, everyone's character. Brother French recently reprimanded the innkeeper’s daughter for unsportsmanlike conduct. Brothers French and Snodgrass had a hay ride at the latter's home last Saturday night. It started out to be a house party until the furnace blew up. Frances and Sweet Sue are suspected of sabotage. (This is a paid political advertisement) Congratulations to Brother Richards who celebrated his 25th birthday on the 19th.

Social ambassadors of North Carolina Theta traced the surrounding areas for points of contact, and Queens for points of contact, during the Georgia-Carolina (Davidson vs. Wm. and Mary) weekend. Leaving early this past Friday for Norfolk, (We don't drink! We don’t smoke...) Virginia were the muscle boys and their jovial caretaker, M. Gambrell. SAE looked mighty good against the Indians and we're all mighty proud. Let us give State some more of the blue devil this weekend. To be seen through the Chapel Hill haze of tobacco, et al, were Brothers Bruce, R. Gambrell (Atlanta, Georgia), H. Hill, M. Hill, R. Little, C. Pahl, Sample, Taylor, and Wilcox. Most stayed around for a while but Brother Taylor hurried away and got back at 6:30. I cannot vouch for this, gentlemen—that Hodgin, Hembry, and Ashmore fulfilled their duties without going east of Suez. But with a close-mouthed trio such as they, even a diligent reporter like this cannot get a precise itinerary of the movies they saw. Rumor has it—I cannot vouch for this either, gentlemen—that 24 men are now potential brothers of SAE. By next Spring when they've all been down for a couple of meals, maybe a bit more can be found out about them (perhaps LD cards will be distributed in the meantime). At any rate, they are from all signs a fine crop of men and we brothers welcome them.

“If you faithfully carry my laundry,
If you neatly clean the house, etc.,—etc.,
Then be a brother, you'll be my son.”

Little, Cand Americans the Western, Germany presents a very discouraging picture to the architects of the new Europe. There seems little chance of early agreement with the Russians on the future of Germany. The prospect is for continued military control. In these circumstances, it will be something of a miracle if the industrial areas of Western Germany are made to serve once again as the center of heavy industry in the region. However, the risks of failure may be assessed, the Marshall Plan offers an opportunity for success in the present chaotic state of affairs, an opportunity the United States should not reject.

The first Davidson yell on record was Rah, Rah, Rah, Run, Run, Run, Pink and Blue, Davidson!

Cinema Comments
BY WALTER MANN

Monday & Tuesday
October 6 and 7
“Living In A Big Way”

From the records of its showing in other cities, “Living In A Big Way” seems to be a rather important production. However, at the eleventh hour, it was impossible to find any clue as to the content thereof. The only thing that one can be sure of is that it is a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer production. Even though the average student may not know just what this picture is about until he sees it, it is recommended that he attend since he will have spent the entire weekend cloistered with his books. We are sure that after he has seen “Living In A Big Way” he will be in favor of next week.

Wednesday & Thursday
October 8 and 9
“Cynthia”

The Cinema Editor of Time says that Cynthia is a family picture. Since this is a family picture, it should be of special interest to Davidson students, as most of them are members of at least one family. This picture is also said to have a slow start. However, it seems that after “Cynthia” gets warmed up, she really puts out. Incidentally, it might be of interest to the readers of the Davidsonian (currently the hottest campus publication on the hill) to know that the star of “Cynthia” is Elizabeth Taylor, who also played the part of a horse in “National Velvet.”

Friday and Saturday
October 10 and 11
“Pacific Adventure”

According to advanced propaganda distributed by the producers of said picture, “Pacific Adventure” is the story of Sir Charles Kingsford Smith’s conquest of the Pacific. There is also a man in this picture who is no doubt responsible for the adventure involved. In case of any interest or pseudo-interest in the stars of this colossal production, they are Ron Randell and Muriel Steinbeck.

Miss Braun requests that all students interested in taking part in this project communicate with her, describing their hobbies, special interests, etc., so that she can give their names to Germans with similar interests. It would be appreciated if the students would enclose a number of self-addressed envelopes to cover expenses and to facilitate replies. Miss Braun’s address is Nana Maria Braun, International Correspondence, 136 Munchen 15, Lindwurmstrasse 126 A, Bavaria, Germany.

All persons on the organization's rolls are students of the English language and will reply in that tongue unless the writer asks that they correspond in German.

With prospects like these and a good coach like Shepard, Davidson should go through this basketball season in grand style.

RIFLE TEAM PRACTICE
(Continued From Page Three)

ROTC groups throughout the entire United States. They will also compete in the Hearst Trophy Match and Third Army Intercollegiate Match. Coaches for this year will be Captain Kennedy and Sgt. Zerby, who replace M. Sgt. Burton. Burton is being retired here at Davidson.

Thomas Jefferson had more influence on the physical appearance of Davidson College than any man who ever lived. The original quadrangle was copied from the building he designed for the University of Virginia, and the present Chambers building is only a “blown-up” Monticello.
