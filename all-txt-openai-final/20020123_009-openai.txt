The weekend before school started, the Davidson swimming and diving teams competed in two swim meets. On Friday, January 11,
they traveled to Maryland to face the Tigers of Towson. The Davidson women lost 131-106, while the men fell 126-98.

On Saturday, January 12, the Wildcats competed against George Mason. Again, both the men and women were defeated, with the
women losing 143-99 and the men falling 137-89. Despite the losses, Wildcats swimmers and divers had some impressive performances.

On Friday against the Tigers, Robert Koch ’04 dominated the 200 free in 1:46.81. Teammate Michael Flowers ’05 won the
500 free, and Foster Matthews ’05 touched the wall in 2:17.29 to win the 200 breast. Finally, the 400 free

Chris Wrobleski ’05, the only male diver for the Wildcats, triumphed over his three opponents to win the one- and
the three-meter dives.

The women also had some outstanding swims. The 400 medley relay team of Sara Laws ’04, Jenny Hoekstra ’05, Lauren
Taft ’05, and Melissa Marquez ’05 won the first event of the meet, finishing in 4:05.87. Laws and Beth Summerlin
’02 dominated in the backstroke, with Laws winning it in 2:09.92 and Summerlin touching shortly after her.

The Wildcat divers claimed victories in both the one-meter and three-meter events. Judit Otvos ’05 placed first in the one-meter
while Jenny Bruggers ’04 was second.

Davidson’s men also contributed strong performances at the meet. In the three-meter dive, Bruggers won and teammate Otvos placed second.

The next day in Virginia, all of the Wildcat victories were from freestyle events. For the women, Jenny Hoekstra ’05

Wrestlers show strength in preseason competition

While most of us spent winter break at home with our families, the Wildcat wrestlers traveled all along the east
coast to compete in several important matches. Although the team has lost several members in the past month, they put
forth a strong effort in all their competitions. Senior captain Jeff Bender commented, “Those who have stayed on the team
are improving dramatically.”

The Wildcats began their winter break drive on December 29 at the Sunshine Open in Ft. Lauderdale, FL. Senior Ryan
Owens picked up a fifth place finish in the 141-pound class, while Bender and sophomore Mo Idlibi both notched victories
in the 157-pound division. Finally, sophomores Mark O’Hair (165), Adam Sperling (149), and freshman Brandon Zeigler (197) all finished 1-2
on the day.

On January 5, the Wildcats traveled to Gettysburg, PA to compete against Gettysburg College and Pensacola Christian. In a strong
effort, the Wildcats came away with four wins against Gettysburg College and two against Pensacola Christian. Bender and junior Grant
Doornbos (149) finished 1-1, while O’Hair and Zeigler ended 2-1.

On January 7, the Wildcats competed in Pittsburgh against Thiel and Duquesne. Zeigler extended his winning streak to four matches,
notching two 3-1 decisions against the Dukes. However, he was the only Wildcat to defeat any Dukes. Bender and O’Hair
finished 1-1, while Doornbos was unable to pull out any victories.

The Wildcats returned to Pennsylvania the following weekend, competing with Franklin & Marshall and Boston College in Lancaster. O’Hair picked
up two wins, leading him to a team-best nine wins. Zeigler and Doornbos also managed wins against Boston College, but
fell to their Franklin & Marshall opponents. Unfortunately, these were the only Wildcat wins of the day, as Bender finished
0-2, and Idlibi and Sperling finished 0-1.

In their most recent competition, the Wildcats traveled to Lexington, VA on January 19 to compete in the Washington &
Lee Invitational. Bender led the team with three wins over Washington & Lee, Scranton, and Cumberland to pick up his
second tournament title in the 157-pound division this season. O’Hair and Zeigler both came up with big wins for the
’Cats, finishing 2-1 and placing second and third, respectively. Sperling and Doornbos struggled with their Cumberland opponents and fell in
the first round.

The Wildcats’ next match is on January 22 at rival Appalachian State in Boone, NC. This is their first Southern
Conference competition of the season.
