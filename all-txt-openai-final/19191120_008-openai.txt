Second Half.

Davidson received in the final half and once more opened up a terrific line attack. Spann used McAlister and McFaden principally in this assault. It seemed as if the Wildcats would finally score on Carolina. At the change of quarters, the ball was well in Carolina territory. The Blue and White rooters were clamoring for the line to hold. Suddenly the tide was stemmed and Spaugh punted the ball well out of danger. Carolina held Davidson for downs in mid-field and on obtaining the ball, skirted left end for a beautiful 25-yard gain. The heavier odds and fresher Carolina subs soon began to tell on the Presbyterians and finally in the last two minutes of play, Spaugh plunged thru the Red and Black defense for the final score. Herrington kicked goal. Carolina 10, Davidson 0.
