**Kappa Sigma honors brothers with MADD Run**

Kappa Sig brothers ran a total of 63 miles on Saturday — all the way from Davidson to Salisbury and back. The run raised money for Mothers Against Drunk Driving and honored two Kappa Sigs who died in an automobile accident in 1989.

The two men that died, “John-O” Reynolds and Patrick Virtue, were friends and fraternity brothers from Salisbury. Reynolds attended Davidson, and Virtue went to the University of Colorado at Boulder. Both of their chapters of the fraternity had a history of supporting MADD with various fundraisers.

John Cook, Assistant to the Director of Alumni Relations at Davidson and a friend of John-O Reynolds, says it seemed only natural to start a MADD run to the students’ hometown. Formerly, Kappa Sig sponsored a MADD run to Charlotte. Cook, who graduated from Davidson in 1992, “started the run way back when” and still advises the Kappa Sigs as they plan the run each year.

The Davidson Kappa Sigs signed up for different miles of the run and began their journey at 8 a.m. at the Davidson Town Green. They finished up back in Davidson around 5 p.m. Their route took them to Salisbury, where the Reynolds family welcomed them with a brunch. Family and community members then made part of the run for the next few miles. Cook ran these miles with Virtue’s father. Other runners included Davidson students who are friends of the families and a few members of other fraternities and eating houses.

Sophomore Thomas Daniel, who helped coordinate this year’s run, wanted to expand participation. He says, “We want to raise awareness that this is not exclusively a Kappa Sig event, but it is important to us that brothers run each mile.”

Money donated to MADD came from various donations, corporate sponsors, and sales of the commemorative t-shirts.

Court is bad...in general it gets in the way of what I value and how I want to educate students,” says German Professor Scott Denham.

Davidson’s social life is not a black or white issue, and most faculty do not have clear-cut opinions about it. Some, however, do. However unclear, many issues related to Patterson Court stand out in our professor’s minds as positives or negatives affecting students at Davidson.

Davidson professors have formulated their perceptions of fraternities and eating houses using many different sources. Some only know what they have seen in the classroom, and some have seen a Saturday night firsthand. Many have been here for several years and base their perceptions upon the days of the 18-year-old drinking age, when professors drank more freely with all students. No matter what the source, the words and thoughts of this cross-section of professors touch on all aspects of the Patterson Court scene.

Generally, most professors do not have a problem with the actual existence of Patterson Court. Chemistry Professor Mitchell Rhea, advisor for PiKA, says that the typical college party is “part of the growing up process-- the absence or presence of the court will not help that any. You’ve just got to get it out of your system, although we don’t condone it, it will go on. [On-campus parties are] better than off-campus-- if it’s going to happen it might as well be on foot rather than behind the wheel.”

English Professor Sara Beasley, '86, agrees, but adds a sentiment echoed by most faculty. “I respect a student’s right to have a social life- non-academic energy is good in the college years- the problem comes when students are prohibited from following through with academic obligations.”

Chair of the Music Department William Lawing notices that a disproportionate amount of students apparently involved with Patterson Court seem to be absent or falling asleep in early morning classes. “There seems to be a relationship,” he says. “We have our eyes open...we take roll, we notice who is falling asleep. You want your students to be invested.”

Math Professor Todd Will says he has taught some morning classes in which students “look like they have been put through the wringers, and that is unfortunate.” However, he says “the bit of hazing that seems to destroy the pledges is the only downside. [Patterson Court] looks like a healthy environment to me. That some drinking goes on is no problem; the problem comes at the point where the drinking intrudes on their studies or their physical well-being.”

Political Science Professor Mary Thornberry, a member of the Alcohol Revision Council, sees Davidson drinking as more of a short-term problem. “My sense is that there does not seem to be a problem of long-term alcoholism. Most students show up for class. There are, however, tendencies for binge drinking. The cases of alcohol poisoning worry me.” She would like to see more alcohol education for students and “a sense that it is possible to party without alcohol. But everyone tells me that it’s never going to happen. The Court as a social scene, however, is good. We can’t blame it all on the Court. Students drink in their rooms as well.”

Many see the general gap between academics and social life to be a disappointment. History Professor and Rusk advisor Sally McMillen says she wishes that “there weren’t such a division be-”tween social and academic life... whether [students spend time at] the Union or on the Court, it’s too bad that we can’t communicate better.” She says, “Women’s eating houses have invited us down, and that has always been really nice. I wish that there could be more events that involve faculty interaction.” Will points out the problem that many faculty find when attending Court functions. “Patterson Court seems to be a good place for interaction, but many are uncomfortable seeing underage drinkers.” Beasley sees a different problem. As a student here, she often mingled with professors on the Court. However, she has found that many current students want a complete separation of their academic and social worlds. “Students feel guilty if they see a professor after they have been drinking,” she says.

Denham sees this separation of worlds as the major problem with Davidson’s social system. “It is important for me to integrate intellectual experiences and fun,” he says. “When I see things on Patterson Court that [come from] the national fraternities, it upsets me because it’s so anti-intellectual. [The national fraternities] have different concerns than those at a highly selective, liberal arts college like Davidson.” He sees fraternity tradition imposed on Davidson students. He asks, “If fraternities were to start from scratch here, would they come up with paddles and road trips?”

Denham advocates the old system of co-ed eating houses. “My wife was a student at Davidson, and when I would come visit her the houses were very different than they are now. There was a whole lot of talking going on.” He wonders why students have not attempted to change the current system. He says, “Everyone needs an outlet. It’s not that [professors] don’t want [students] to play. It just seems like the opportunities for different kinds of play are limited.”

English Professor Gail Gibson sees a similar problem. She expresses disappointment at the turns that Patterson Court has taken in the last few years, and after hearing all sorts of stories about abuses, she made the conscious choice to “withdraw.” Gibson believes that the Senior Apartments have made a difference in relations between the sexes. “The environment there is so much more natural than the other dorms, where the rooms are lined up like cells and students tend to behave like inmates.”

Many professors see male/female relations as a problem at Davidson. Political Science Professor Shelley Rigger gets the impression that “men and women don’t hang out together much. Single sex can sometimes nurture unhealthy environments. Single sex is not necessarily natural.” Wertheimer expresses a similar feeling. “I’m not sure that [Patterson Court] is the most productive encounter between the sexes,” he says. However, English Professor Cynthia Lewis visited the Court this semester and felt that relations seemed healthy. She says, “I was surprised at how comfortable men and women seemed to be with each other.” Beasley looks back at the co-ed houses and notes that they “took the pressure off. Students did not feel that they were endangered.”

Some professors have noted defensiveness on the part of fraternities. McMillen says that the fraternities tend to try to “overexplain their existence.” Rigger feels that there is little persecution and most of it stems from a lack of alternatives. The lack of alternatives to the Court seems to be the biggest concern to most faculty. Levering sees a problem with the exclusivity of fraternities. “Instinctively I wish that the membership could be more open. I am not anti-fraternity, but my ideal would be that the men’s eating houses could be the same.” Lawing agrees. “[Many] faculty would feel that the manner of selection by which the fraternities is fundamentally flawed.”

Denham calls the self-selection process a “lie. The college is looking the other way. Either there should be an open system or national fraternities should be banned.” He also sees that the tradition that many fraternities perpetuate is “classist, sexist and racist—two or three in particular. Look at Old South. What does that say about KA?” Lawing recognizes that faculty are idealistic, but asks, “What is our job here? We are giving students a liberal arts education. We have to be idealistic, and we ought to be. We don’t live in Davidson, so we probably have skewed perceptions, and we tend to speak in sound bites which is too bad. I think, though, that there is something that goes into that.”

Beasley would like to know the real story. “I would just love to be invited to a fraternity house,” she says.

Pulled from page 1 with the Dean of Students, BSC, and SGA. We have made headway. We don’t want anyone uncomfortable. This is not a race issue. It has just been misconstrued. We were doing our job.” Ray Thrower, head of the Davidson Campus Police, adds, “The officer did not know who was in the car because of the tinted windows. It could have been anyone.” He states that there have been recent incidents involving non-students stealing, most recently from Baker. “We realize that this is the students’ community, and we are here to help them. But they must help us.”

On March 14, SGA member Nikki Liverman brought the incident to the SGA’s attention. At Tuesday’s meeting, Liverman and Latasha Jenkins, Chair of the Committee on Minority Concerns (COMA), will present a proposal for the SGA’s approval.
