right into a local film library
disappear overnight. Who to-

day would not like to be able to

see such student classics shot in
years past as The Battle of Goat
Island, The Egg Rock Chain-
saw Massacre,
Doares’s adaptation of Flan-
nery O'Connor's The Life You
Save May Be Your Own (Doar-
es is in charge of the Marburg
JYA program now)? All of these
should be available somewhere
in the living archives of the
school.

The second issue of The
Davidson Miscellany, which ap-
peared during the winter, com-
pletes volume fourteen of the
long run under the original title
The Miscellany: A Davidson
Review. The first year under
the new title seems auspicious
both in the content and appear-
ance of the publication.

from the tradition of feeling.
“From morning to night they
hear nothing that can prepare
them for it. Take jazz and
rock-and-roll, with its wonder-
ful beat and rhythm which is
very close to the jungle. This
rhythm puts the mind into a
state of hypnosis.

But Mozart and Beethoven
and Schubert do just the oppo-
site. They quicken the aware-
ness of the spirit. It is no

accident that modern symphon-
ists use every sound from a
siren to who-knows-what, and,
in its own setting, I guess this
is right.”

“But the classical composers
spoke to the spirit with a song
or dance. Goethe said we go
through some periods of history
which show great technical
progress and some which have
progress of the spirit. But the
times which are remembered are
the times of spirit!” said Kraus.

If you pick up a copy of any
other national and regional
literary magazines and compare
quality you will not be dis-
appointed.

Fred Chappell, Nadine Est-
roff, Peter Sharpe, and Lewis
Turco, well-known writers who
have published here before, are
again represented by fine pie-
ces. Alfred G. Bailey, one of the
leading poets of Canada, ap-
pears for the first time.

The first issue under the new
title features a long interview
with Robert Creeley, a leading
national poet and columnist for
The Village Voice and a regular
guest to the campus over the
last few years.

The volume as a whole repre-
sents Davidson writers well. By
my count, about one-fourth of
the contributors are students,
faculty, alumni, and past
guests of the college.

It is important that the
Davidson connection be strong
in The Davidson Miscellany and
important that we continue to
publish the best manuscripts by
the best writers wherever they
come from.

With hard times for literary
magazines in the South and
elsewhere, the hour is right for
us to catch up with the most
illustrious in the land.

The student co-editors of
volume fourteen, Patsy Daniels
and Gary Hart, and faculty
co-editor Professor Winkler
have published a magazine that
reflects well on the college. The
new student co-editors Meri-
deth Durden and Susan Deho-
ney now have the chance to
advance the enterprise further.

Dr. Gill Holland is a member of
the Davidson College English
Department.

In addition to faculty work,
there will be a collection of
beautiful 19th century prints,
some contemporary prints by
New York artists, and out-
standing work by Davidson
students including paintings
and prints. Several limited edi-
tion posters from the 1960's will
also be available.

The mood of the event is
lighthearted and easy. The auc-
tioneer will be Professor Herb
Jackson.

Join the crowd that enjoys the delicious pizza at Mooresville’s King of
Pizza. The food maintains an excellent reputation for being fresh, warm,
and of excellent quality. Davidson students enjoy the relaxed atmosphere
or the take-out order service.

Cullowhee

Cullowhee, formerly Edwards, Clark, Flynn and Jenkins,
returns to the 900 Room this Thursday night.

The name “Cullowhee” is adopted from the band's original
hometown in the North Carolina mountains.

“Their music is original—a blend of folk, country, rock, and a
taste of jazz.”

“They present their songs in a carefully placed stage show,
spiced with humor and built upon unique personalities. Their music
is rich, filled with a variety of vocals and instrumentals which are
subtle and powerful at the same time.

“Cullowhee’s real strength lies in their ability to project their
personalities on stage to their audiences.”
