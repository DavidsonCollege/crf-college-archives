If you've ever wanted to get above it all, then the Air Force ROTC Flight Screening Program may be for
you. You'll learn the basics of flight through flying lessons in small aircraft.

It's an additional program for Air Force ROTC cadets who can qualify to become pilots. With your Air Force ROTC
training, it’s your first step to pilot training.

You can do something about your desire to fly ... with the best. Talk to your campus Air Force ROTC
representative today.
