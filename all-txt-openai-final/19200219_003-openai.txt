REV. S. H. HAY SPEAKS AT “Y” SERVICE.
Excellent Address on “The Foundation of a Man’s Life.”
Rev. S. H. Hay, of the class of '06, addressed the “Y” Sunday night. Mr. Hay has been the pastor of the Mooresville Presbyterian Church for several years. In spite of the flu and the large number of men off the hill, the attendance was the largest this year. After the regular service, a song service was held, as there were no other religious services during the day.

“The Foundation of a Man’s Life” was the subject of the address. The text was taken from Isaiah: “Behold, I have laid in Zion a stone, a sure foundation.” The ideal for which a man starts out in life has everything to do with his success.

The speaker took up the different passions which actuate men’s lives, beginning with the lower and going up to the highest. Idleness and the desire for ease wreck many lives. They do not, however, affect college graduates often. Greed is a far more common and alluring goal. While thrift and the desire to gain are perfectly legitimate, they are dangerous and unsatisfying ambitions. Many men are swayed by the lure of position or power. Others, of higher ideals, strive for personal excellence or obedience to duty. It is indeed noble to be one to whom o-u-g-h-t spells m-u-s-t. Next to the highest ambition of all is service. Christ thundered out the call to service nineteen centuries ago, and the present generation has seen the world respond to that call. But man can strive to serve humanity and yet lack the greatest and deepest motive power of all—the striving after a Christ-like life. Every man should ask, “Christ to his Savior.”should try to ‘be like Him, and bring his will to Him. The only way to do the will of God is to ask incessantly what His will is, in every action of one's life. The only sure foundation for mankind is Christ.

QUARANTINE AGAIN PREVENTS BIBLE CLASSES AND SUNDAY SCHOOLS.

While the “flu” epidemic is a thing of the past as far as Davidson College is concerned, yet Dr. MacConnell thought it best to maintain the quarantine regarding church. Due to this fact, also the Bible Classes and Sunday Schools were not held. It is hoped that by next Sunday conditions will permit the resuming of the customary Sunday activities.

Of our Training School for Life Insurance Salesmen recently produced $308,000 in forty-five days. During the same period, twenty-eight Training School men produced $2,694,000, an average of $92,000 per man. When an agent signs a contract with the Southern Life and Trust Company, we don’t pat him on the back, turn him loose and tell him to “go to it." We give him a preliminary correspondence course, and then a course in our Training School at the Home Office, and then keep in touch with him and help him overcome his weak points and strengthen his strong points. As a result, our Training School men are making good. Drop us a line and ask us to give you full particulars.
