### Massage Workshop Touches Students’ Sensibilities
By TED WILSON

“You're so relaxed, you feel like you’ve taken a nap, even though you’re awake,” said one student, after attending Jason
Thompson’s massage workshop. Thompson, an Economics professor, instructs the one-hour class every Wednesday at 6:45 p.m. in the Union’s Big
Screen Room. The workshop, open to all students and faculty, emphasizes touching in a very non-sexual way to become relaxed.
Thompson shows the participants how to relax the neck, back, arms, feet, and head. He says that the body can
be deprived if it isn’t touched frequently enough. “The human body needs to be touched,” he emphasized. Along with this
need is the importance of the partner ‘listening to the person’s body and being sensitive to it,” Thompson said. The
person giving the massage must find the tense parts of the back, neck, and so on and try to relax
them.

Thompson, a Davidson alumnus, said he “really got interested in massaging when I went to California during Spring Break. I
met several people there who are really into it.” He noted that Californians “have a different attitude about touching. It’s
important to have this workshop to break the ice” because many people feel inhibited about the idea. “It’s important for
people to touch in non-sexual ways. On the East Coast, massaging is more associated with sex than on the West
Coast.” He said the workshop gives students an excuse to “break the ice,” and to feel more comfortable about touching.

The participants’ reactions to the workshop were consistent. “Clearly, I enjoyed it,” one said. Another added, “You have someone with
their hands on you in a non-aggressive way to help you and to make you feel good.” Several participants said
they felt “nervous and apprehensive” about attending. “I was skeptical because the word ‘massage’ has a negative connotation,” one student
commented. Said another, “I thought it would be weird and too flower-childish,” but added it was “wonderful.” One participant “feels
good because I’m doing something good for someone else.” “My favorite part is giving massages. It’s relaxing to me because
I’m relaxing someone else,” one student observed. “We don’t get enough of this kind of thing,” another student commented.

The main reason most participants attend the workshop is to feel relaxed. One added, “Our hall gives backrubs and it
sounded neat.” “It was a spontaneous decision for me, and I was bored,” another student said. “I want to learn
how to get and give backrubs,” was another response. Relieving test anxiety was another reason cited for attending. Though roughly
a dozen people showed up at Wednesday’s session, one student said, “the whole school should come to this!”

Thompson said that often, a person’s body is “screaming out,” wanting to be touched but the “inhibitions are greater than
the need they feel.” To alleviate anxieties about massaging, he suggests “coming to the workshop and trying it. Put your
hands on someone’s shoulders, squeeze them and see how it feels.” One participant asked, “How many other courses can you
take home with you, do with friends and enjoy it? How many times do you do calculus with your friends
and enjoy it?”

### Sense Of The Absurd Highlights Diva Sequel Nana
By ROSS HOLT

Why should anyone devote column space to review what appears to be a pop thriller, a run-of-the-mill mystery yarn, in
fact, the second book in a series of mystery yarns? Because the first in that series was a unique, off-the-wall
suspense masterpiece — which became a critically acclaimed film — called Diva. Now, Delacorta, Diva's author, has penned the second
book built upon the same characters, Nana.

Diva's story concerned a young Parisian boy’s love for a renowned opera singer, and the danger in which he finds
himself when the confessions of a gangster’s girlfriend get mixed in with his collection of bootleg tapes. At the core
of the story, however, stood Serge Gorodish, a man of mysterious means, and his helpmate Alba, a thirteen-year-old kleptomaniac. They
provided the catalyst, playing the yarn’s antagonists off against one another until justice — and not necessarily legal justice —
had been served, and they themselves had lined their pockets in the resulting bonanza.

Nana deals more directly with Gorodish and Alba, and tells the story of how this odd match came about. As
the story opens, Gorodish has arrived in a small provin-cial town — “12,300 inhabitants (9400 Catholic, 387 Protestant, 6149 leftists,
6151 rightists),” Delacorta tells us — with a vague plan to bilk the entire town out of its wealth. Though
Gorodish is the novel’s hero, Delacorta (a pen-name for David Odier, an acclaimed Swiss writer) has created an ultimate anti-hero.
Gorodish, after being a concert pianist, became a gangster’s chauffeur, a photographer of young girls (very young and very artistic,
as Delacorta tactfully explains), and is currently an artist. Ultra-cool and knowledgeable about everything from classical music to knife-throwing, Gorodish
never loses his composure.

The only kink (which is not an altogether inappropriate word) in his armor occurs when Alba appears in his life.
Alba is a very experienced, very bored young woman who falls in love with Gorodish (as he falls in love
with her) from afar. She translates her boredom into petty larceny, a trade she has manipulated into a fine art.
The two join forces and bring long-buried tensions in the town to the surface, with an eye entirely to their
own enrichment. They maintain their anonymity, however, so they stand in the eye of a storm, playing everyone off against
everyone else.

Delacorta’s genius, and what lifts his work above that of standard suspense writers, is his staggering sense of the absurd.
What seem to be normal occurrences or clichés of the genre suddenly become freakish, bizarre, or off-the-wall bits of literary
double-take. Delacorta describes Gorodish’s photography hobby in the glowing, complimentary terms of an art critic: These were his greatest creation,
the height of his artistic sensibility, the most profound expression of his genius. His talent for his special art had
been recognized, and rewarded, by collectors throughout the world. His creativity had grown, blossomed, and flourished. He had even published
a deluxe edition for his most devoted fans: it had sold out before publication.

But then Delacorta suddenly adds, “Then, one day, he had learned that there was a warrant out for his arrest
for contributing to the delinquency of a minor.” The effect of this is to keep the reader in suspense in
every way possible — anything can happen next, and the most subtle of references may be the key to some
important event later on. At one point, Alba, dazed by a circus magician’s feat of levitating her, slips back the
bolt on the lion cage. Only later in a brief allusion to a newspaper story do we learn that an
escaped circus lion has torn three people apart and devoured them.

Delacorta — as do his characters — always manages to communicate feeling without being too explicit. Gorodish and Alba feel
a great deal of desire for each other, but no consummation is ever even implied, despite some fairly erotic (but
relatively tame) scenes between them. In that way, Delacorta makes what would be taboo — oddly and against the reader’s
better judgment — almost acceptable. Toward the end of the book, he uses less than a half-page to depict a
heinous act of police brutality. His economical and ingenious use of prose, however, turns what in any ordinary thriller would
have taken three pages of bloodletting into a brief, terrifying ballet.

He is also economical in the depiction of characters peripheral to Gorodish and Alba. His descriptions of these characters seem
at once sketchy, but he relies on the assumption that we know them already. A police commissioner, two hookers, various
town officials, motorcycle gang members, mobsters, and others we have seen before; Delacorta merely adds in enough information and imagination
to make them whole and to distance them from the stereotypical. He also pulls back when his plot verges on
melodrama; he employs the absurd or he diffuses the situation with that bane of commercial thriller writers — common sense.

Nana is a delight; it is entertaining and intelligent, and entirely off the wall. A parish priest and his church’s
women’s organization get their picnic goodies laced with LSD — and discover later that the resulting Bacchanalian ritual has been
captured on film. A biker and his girlfriend make love — on a speeding motorcycle. And an assortment of corrupt
rich people receive their just desserts, compliments of Gorodish and Alba. Nana stands head and shoulders above the product of
“writers” as Ludlum and MacLean; it is a substantial thriller which relies on people, not guns and explosions, to create
its effects.
