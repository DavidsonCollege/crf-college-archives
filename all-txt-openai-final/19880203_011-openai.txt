Alcohol policy protects Court from negligence disaster

Holly Sparks

As one of two remaining students who were members of the Patterson Court Council that drafted the initial Patterson Court Alcohol Policy, I would like to address David Ethridge’s question concerning the use of Davidson College IDs at Patterson Court parties. While retracing the reasoning behind this particular guideline, I would also like to discuss the original purpose of the entire Patterson Court Alcohol Policy which seems to have been forgotten, or at least appears to be misapprehended by many Davidson students.

In this decade, public awareness concerning the detrimental effects of alcohol abuse has risen dramatically. Drunk drivers have commanded particular attention as statistics have become available which suggest that more than half of the nation’s annual highway deaths are alcohol-related. Courts and legislatures have responded to the increased concern with stiffer penalties for drunk driving, and new laws and rulings which encourage more responsible service and consumption of alcoholic beverages. Special attention has been focused on drinking by young people, as evidenced by the federal law which halted highway funds to states which did not raise the legal drinking age to 21 by October 1986.

As most people know, ABC stores and bars may not legally sell alcoholic beverages to visibly intoxicated or underage individuals. If they do, they are normally liable for any injury to the intoxicated customer or to a third party which results from the customer’s intoxicated state. A “social host” (one who provides alcohol but does not sell it, e.g. a Patterson Court house) has been exempt from this liability in the past. Since 1984, however, several courts have ruled that under certain conditions a social host may be liable for an injury to a guest or to a third party which is caused by the intoxicated state of the guest. If a judge or jury finds a social host negligent, precedent exists for awarding the plaintiff a multi-million dollar settlement.

In light of these rulings and the drinking age change, Davidson College developed its own alcohol policy in an effort to educate and to protect faculty, staff, and students from unwitting irresponsible behavior. In reference to Patterson Court activities, the Davidson College Alcohol Policy recognized that “the decisions of various courts in cases involving injuries resulting from alcohol abuse have placed primary responsibility not on the institution, but rather on students and student organizations.” These decisions are the reason the Patterson Court Council was charged with creating its own alcohol policy. As David will surely applaud, the Davidson Alcohol Policy does indeed treat students as the adults we are, and places the responsibility for our social activities “firmly where it belongs,” and where legal accountability will rest in the event of a lawsuit.

The Patterson Court Alcohol Policy was thus designed to protect house members (and guests) from the potentially disastrous consequences of irresponsible service or consumption of alcohol. In drafting the PC Alcohol Policy, the PCC wished to promote responsible practices (such as making food and alternatives available), and wished to outline reasonable precautions for ensuring that Patterson Court houses did not serve either visibly intoxicated or underage individuals. According to North Carolina law, Patterson Court houses are not required to ask for any identification whatsoever. As social hosts, Patterson Court houses are required only to make sure that North Carolina laws concerning the drinking age are obeyed; state law does not specify how social hosts are to determine the ages of their guests.

The PCC felt that requiring a Davidson College ID would be an effective tool for ensuring that underage individuals did not obtain access to the designated service area for two reasons: Davidson IDs would be both reliable and uniform. There are specific reasons why falsifying a Davidson College ID is an Honor Code violation, but for the sake of brevity I will postpone discussion on that topic until a future Davidsonian issue. Even without delving into the Honor Code issue, however, I think the PCC reasonably believed that many people who would consider using a false driver’s license would not falsify a Davidson ID. The PCC also felt that the uniformity of Davidson IDs would protect both the entrance monitor and the house from inadvertently violating the law. David ridicules the idea that discerning the validity of state licenses would be “too tough;” perhaps not, but the PCC concluded that chancing a mistake just wasn’t worth the risk. Davidson students are not trained to recognize false IDs, and I sincerely doubt that many students carry the kind of insurance that ABC employees and paid bartenders do for protection against failing to catch a false ID.

David commented that the clerk who sold alcohol to his underage acquaintance was found innocent of breaking state law “[g]iven the near perfect forgery.” But what if a not-so-perfectly forged license got past a Davidson monitor? Let me demonstrate the implications of this risk to the monitor (and by extension to the house) by describing a possible scenario. Let’s assume that an underage Davidson student, who finds the desire for a drink more pressing than an assumed obligation to the members of a Patterson Court house, presents a false state license to the entrance monitor and is admitted to the service area. Let’s assume, as David would, that the student accepts “the full consequences of any wrongdoing.” After consuming several drinks, the student leaves the party, and sets off by car to get something to eat in Cornelius. On the way, however, the student runs a stoplight and collides with another car, killing the driver. Relatives of the victim bring a lawsuit. Despite the student’s poor judgment in driving, despite the fact that the false identification appeared real to the monitor’s eye, the Patterson Court house which provided the alcohol will be sued, and this boils down to the entrance monitor who is ultimately responsible for allowing the student access to the alcohol. The Patterson Court house will have to show evidence in court of safe practices and reasonable precautions. If the house can demonstrate that it had food and alternatives available, that it employed entrance and service monitors, that the entrance monitors even turned away visibly intoxicated or underage individuals, it will be in a much stronger position to defend itself against charges of negligence.People with suspicious IDs, and other such responsible actions, then the house will have a chance at proving that it was not negligent, and the responsibility will be placed on the student. If the house cannot prove that it took enough reasonable precautions, then the house (i.e., the service monitor) may be found liable for the victim’s death. David charges that the PC Alcohol Policy “discriminates” against Davidson students by requiring a Davidson ID instead of the license or passport required of guests. I argue that perhaps Patterson Court houses should adopt a system like the one used in the 900 Room: guests to the 900 Room must be vouched for by a Davidson student who assumes responsibility if the guest shows a false ID. At any rate, although requiring a Davidson ID might be inconvenient to patrons of Patterson Court parties who have left it behind, the protection that the Davidson ID offers to the entrance monitors is worth the inconvenience. I agree with David that the PCC needs to take a serious look at the Court alcohol policy. The policy must be workable and enforceable. The guidelines are to protect house members, but if the Court fails to enforce them, they could be turned against a house in the event of a lawsuit as evidence of failure to live up to its own standards. One prime area of amendment should be the composition of the Enforcement Council since the conflict of interest has proven to be too great for the social chairs. In closing, let me also urge the college administration to hold up its end of the Davidson College Alcohol Policy by ensuring that at least house presidents and social chairs are fully informed of the state laws and court decisions which prompted the PCC to develop an alcohol policy in the first place. Without a clear understanding of the reasons behind the rules, the policy stands little chance of success.

Frank Albinder's teaching ability merits contract renewal

Grier Stewart

For about 135 years young men from around the South and, to some extent, from around the world came to study at Davidson College. Davidson rose to become one of the finest institutions in the South and the nation under these conditions. But then, it was determined that it was time for change: Women were admitted for the first time approximately 15 years ago. This was and is the best decision for Davidson. Perhaps some time from now it may change again, but I don’t believe it will be anytime soon. The point of this little allusion to D.C.’s history is that sometimes what has worked before for some reason has to be changed. I believe that this time has arisen again at Davidson. I am referring to the present system of faculty evaluation. In the past two years, two questionable decisions have been made with this process. Before that (at least in the two years in which I was a student) no decision had been a real surprise. Last year the first of these was made concerning Dr. John Engell. I know of Dr. Engell only through reputation; however, his reputation among students was and is very good. The second of these questionable decisions was made a little over a month ago concerning Mr. Frank Albinder. Last year, I knew that I didn’t have an argument based only on reputation. This time, however, I know the person involved well. Mr. Albinder was one of the first of the faculty with whom I had contact when I arrived at Davidson. I auditioned for the choir thinking that I had little if any chance of making it. I had foreseen the choir director as being gruff and unsympathetic. My panic soon ceased, however, shortly after I began my “quick and painless” audition. Since that time I have been in choir for four years, taken voice lessons from Frank, had him as an instructor in Music 101, and made a lasting friend. My goal in this article is to try to show all of you who Frank is. First, he is a teacher, and quite honestly, he is one of the best I’ve had here (I’ve had 30 different professors). He has the innate ability to make class interesting and memorable. He understands and knows the material on which he’s lecturing backwards and forwards, and he is able to convey that knowledge very successfully. Inevitably, there is always someone who just can’t quite comprehend the material. In this case, if the student is working hard, Frank is always helpful. He is almost always around the music department if he is needed. But now, back to class... His reviews are always fair (though not easy). If you do the work, you will not do
