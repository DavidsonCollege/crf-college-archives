The DAVIDSONIAN April. Red Cross News

We wish to call attention to the fact that the Musical Festival, which is to be held in Charlotte, April 26-27, is for the benefit of our Red Cross work. We should bear in mind that the surgical dressing and work for the hospitals is only a small part of the burden the Red Cross carries. Below is a report of work in relief and restoration done in France in the month of February:

During this one month, substantial aid was given to over a hundred thousand French refugees, repatriates, and other war sufferers. This number included about twenty thousand persons in the devastated areas, seven thousand five hundred repatriates in provinces, and nearly six thousand undernourished Paris school children. More than twenty-two thousand people were given hospital care during this one month, including thousands of repatriate children at Evian, and about a thousand tuberculosis patients in Paris who were given supplementary rations daily.

Work is now being conducted by the Red Cross in ninety-eight French cities and villages, not including the Friends’ Unit which has twenty-one relief stations, or the Smith College Unit, which works in eleven villages. Nine civilian hospitals, with a total capacity of more than a thousand beds and forty-six dispensaries, give care to children, tuberculosis patients, and refugees. Grants of money to French organizations during the month totaled more than half a million francs, and, in addition, large quantities of clothing, food, and household goods were distributed. The Red Cross now has a staff of four hundred and ninety workers in France, sixty-six having been added during February.

Misses Juliette Bristol, Julia Sherrill, Marie Stephens, Virginia Henkle, of Statesville, were the guests of the Pi Kappa Alpha’s on last Saturday.

WILD CATS’ SOUTHERN TRIP (Continued from page 5)

Winning ball throughout both games. He developed a wild streak in the second game, but after the second inning, he was just as completely master of ceremonies as in the first contest. In the first game, the Wildcats hit everything Asbury and Murphy offered and stole bases almost at will. The hard luck that Hengeveld experienced in the first U. of S. C. game again presented itself in the second game. Although “Dutch” allowed only four hits, Tech was presented with enough runs in the first two innings to put the game on ice. Pruitt also pitched well, allowing five hits. Each pitcher fanned four men. Ingram, with a triple in the first game and three singles and a home run in the second, was the leading hitter for Tech. Spann was the individual star for the “Wildcats” with a three-bagger and a single in the first, and a three-bagger in the second contest.

OGLETHORPE GAME
By taking advantage of their opponents’ misplays and hitting Warwick at opportune times, the “Wildcats” ended their highly successful march through Georgia. Currie pitched a strong, heady game for Davidson and the Presbyterians found a tartar in southpaw Warwick. The Oglethorpe twirler pitched good ball, but received poor support. When we take into consideration the fact that this game marked Oglethorpe’s entrance into intercollegiate sports, we have nothing but praise for their team in the great fight they put up. The fact that Davidson won the game promises nothing for the future. We realize that we have a new and worthy opponent in the field of athletics. And we feel safe in predicting, as we welcome Oglethorpe into the circle of Southern collegiate athletics, that in days to come there will be many an evenly and fairly contested game fought out in friendly rivalry when Greek meets Greek—or Presbyterian meets Presbyterian.

The score:
