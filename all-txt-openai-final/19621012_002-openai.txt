THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

PAGE TWO FRIDAY, OCTOBER 12, 1962

(All Unsigned Editorials by the Editor)

A Matter Of Principle

STUDENT CONDUCT

1. Davidson students are expected to conduct themselves as gentlemen. Any student who is guilty of ungentlemanly conduct or whose
conduct is such as to attract unfavorable attention to himself or to Davidson College may expect disciplinary action. This action
may be expulsion, suspension or some lesser penalty depending on the seriousness of the offense.

4. Use of Alcoholic Beverages. Davidson College is opposed as a matter of principle to the use of alcoholic beverages
by students. A student will ordinarily be suspended if he is found guilty of drinking, possessing or being under the
influence of an alcoholic beverage while within the town limits of Davidson or while attending any off-campus event sponsored entirely
or in part by Davidson College. Student drinking not covered by the rule stated in the preceding paragraph may be
dealt with under Item 1 of the rules stated under STUDENT CONDUCT.

(from Davidson College Regulations)

SOCIAL FUNCTION STATEMENT OF CONDUCT

FRATERNITY OR CLUB EVENT

DATE

I attended the campus activities involving my fraternity on the occasion referred to above. To the best of my knowledge,
there was no drinking or ungentlemanly conduct on the part of the members of my fraternity at the fraternity house
or at any campus activity sponsored wholly or in part by my fraternity. I certify that all alumni and guests
of my fraternity conducted themselves properly while on the premises of the fraternity.

Have a ball fellas.

One For The Girls

Last week we saw the spirit of foster motherhood give in a little here at Davidson. The faculty gave students
the right to cut classes, up to 25 per cent, at any time they saw fit. In the words of
President D. Grier Martin, “the responsibility now rests with the students.” What was significant about this action was that it
stemmed, at least in part, from student action. Both THE DAVIDSONIAN and the Student Council clearly made their positions known
to the faculty and administration. The faculty action gave testimony that the college does listen to the opinions of the
students and that these opinions can make a difference.

We suggest that our fair visitors think about this seriously. Is this the case at your school? If not, why
not? We would, in fact, like to take what we consider to be a typical case. This is the case
of the Queen’s drinking rule. In passing let it be said that we chose Queen’s because right from the start
officials here (and there) seem to encourage attitudes of “agape” on both sides of the fence. So despite any animalistic
references, we think most Davidson men, except those who have passed their jewelry off elsewhere, do feel a kinship.

The drinking rule, as we understand it, states emphatically that Queens ladies will not drink and if they do the
minimum punishment will be suspension. Let’s examine the logic of this. Logic that many of us are all too familiar
with. First of all, from the administrative point of view, there is something inherently bad about drinking. Moreover, the above
rule assumes that the college girl is less than responsible when it comes to drinking. The rule assumes that each
and every girl will rationalize something like this before she turns in her roommate or close friend: “This is a
rule and rules were meant to be obeyed. Besides she is doing something that is bad for her so I
will be rendering her a real service if I turn her in and she is suspended or expelled from school.”
And this is only on the altruistic level. Pragmatically, we have observed that the rule doesn’t really work. Its only
results are to get someone kicked out of school every once in a while.

We don't pretend to speak from any height of perfection. We have our own drinking incongruity which prescribes that twelve
are responsible for 850 (see above). What we find appalling about the whole situation, as is the case with so
many restrictive rules, is that the students take little or no collective action to make their feelings known. A question
occurs to us. Will you put your faith in the status quo for the rest of your life too?

The Way We See It

@The Baptists have beaten us to the punch again. The ROTC Corps at Wake Forest has announced that a new
position has been created—cadet chaplain. He will be responsible for “coordinating all religious ... and any charitable activities of the
cadet corps.” And he will have an assistant. “Company-e-e-e Pray! One-Two!”

@Any student who strayed out in the rain during the week perhaps noticed the flag plastered to its pole. Shows
we've got more than fair-weather patriots anyway.

@THE PIONEER, student newspaper at Catawba College, is trying a new twist to get more readers from other colleges. We
have just received their latest effort. It was perfumed. Yep, you're right, the editor’s a girl.

@If you want to take your girl to the big dance Homecoming looks like you've got to go formal. For
those who don’t have a tux our-man-under-arms has a solution. Wear your ROTC uniform!

@We couldn’t help noticing in THE SALEMITE, Salem College’s newspaper, the editorial which stated, “Gov Ross Barnett and other officials
of Mississippi can only be admired...” It reminded us of another comment by Negro Comedian Dick Gregory. To paraphrase, “I
admire Ross Barnett and all that, but I sure wouldn’t want him dating my sister.”

@There’s a sticker in the student store that’s creating quite a furor. The cocky subtitle says, “A Davidson Man Needs
No Introduction.” Obviously meant for girls’ schools, we are waiting to see something like “And Sweetbriar Ladies Don’t Want One.”

@After all’s been said and done, there is one hopeful thing about the Mississippi chapter. Perhaps now the black supremacist
and communistic propagandists will forget about Little Rock.

Could It Really Happen Here?

Oh, I have been to Ludlow fair
And left my necktie God knows where,
And carried half way home, or near,
Pints and quarts of Ludlow beer;
Then the world seemed none so bad,
And I myself a sterling lad;
And down in lovely muck I’ve lain,
Happy till I woke again.
Then I saw the morning sky:
Heigho, the tale was all a lie;

The Search For Ungentlemanly Conduct . . . By Adams

The world, it was the old world yet,
I was I, my things were wet,
And nothing now remained to do
But begin the game anew.

Poll Reveals Opinions Of Faculty Cut Ruling

BY JEFF WAMPLER
Davidsonian Managing Editor

This past week, THE DAVIDSONIAN conducted a public opinion poll among a small number of students concerning the recent decision
of the faculty to abolish the holiday clause of the cut system. Questionnaires were distributed at random to 17 members
of the sophomore, junior, and senior classes. The two questions posed were: (1) Do you plan to cut any classes
before or after holidays? (2) In view of the fact that the new cut rule is in effect on a
trial basis, what action do you think the faculty should take if a mass exodus occurs, that is, if a
large number of people cut their classes before and/or after a holiday?

In answer to the first question, five students indicated that they did not plan to cut classes before or after
holidays; the remaining 12 indicated that they did. The answers to the second question fell into three general groups, with
some overlapping. Seven of those questioned felt that if a large number of students cut, theFaculty should not take any
action. A junior business major writes: "I fail to see why it should affect the faculty member very much either
way. The persons hurt are the students who cut, not their professors. It seems to me that the size of
his class should not affect the quality or effectiveness of his lectures." A junior math major disagreed—"If there is a
very large number who cut, it will have a bad effect on the professor."—but failed to elaborate. All seven emphasized
that the student should definitely be held responsible for the material covered in class. Four students, all juniors, commented on
the possibility of professors scheduling tests and/or reviews on the period immediately before or after a holiday. Three felt that
tests should not be scheduled on these days. The fourth, an economics major, disagreed: "No action should be taken immediately;
it must be looked at from the students’ point of view i.e., does it really affect the grades of those
who cut before holidays? If it does, then professors could give reviews before holidays which the students couldn't cut."

The third general group, numbering five students, felt that some type of cut penalty should be imposed. Commented a sophomore:
"If the vacation rule as it now stands were removed, the new cut system would be worse than the old.
This is really its only advantage. I think some restriction, such as a substantial number of cuts as a penalty,
will be needed." A senior English major felt that the faculty should take action only to the extent of double
or triple cuts. One reply to the second question that defied classification was that of a senior English major: "If
a guy wants to cut his own throat, let him."

These are the results. What significance can be attached to them? The fact is that the number of students polled
was small (17). But the questionnaires were distributed at random. Of the 17, three were sophomores, 12 juniors, and three
seniors. Their approximate grade averages ranged from 1.00 to 2.70, with the average being 1.78. There were four English majors,
four business majors, four pre-med majors, two economics majors, two math majors, and one major in chemistry. One fact to
be kept in mind concerning the first question is that there are some students who have always cut before or
after holidays because they live at a great distance from Davidson.

This poll was taken by THE DAVIDSONIAN solely to feel the pulse of student reaction to the new cut rule.
The real test of the faculty’s confidence in the maturity and responsibility of the student body will come in six
weeks with the Thanksgiving holiday. Whether or not the faculty will allow the new ruling to remain a part of
the cut system will depend to a large degree on the attitude of the student body as manifested at that
time.

**Homecoming Thoughts: ... Us And Them**

**BY DAVE PUSEY**
**Davidsonian Feature Writer**

He: “A blind date from Converse. Those girls are supposed to be sharp... real party girls. Hope this one is
no exception.”

She: “A Davidson gentleman for Homecoming. Even if he’s a fool, I just hope he’s in a decent frat.”

He: “She looks good, but it must have been a long bus ride. Oh well, these girls will do anything
to get to one of our weekends.”

She: “Gads, what a grimy trip. This had best be worth the trouble!”

He: “It's a good thing there's that rule about the girls having to pay for their transportation and room. A
few coins saved after all.”

She: “Nice! Of all the sneaky, ridiculous... I guess I buy the football game programs, too. And maybe Saturday supper
if I’m lucky!”

He: “I hope those guys can hold it down this one time. No roll tossing or Bo Diddley for dinner
music, and everything ought to be OK.”

She: “Eating at a fraternity house? The way to a man’s heart... personified, no doubt. In living ketchup and gravy.
Brace yourself, kid.”

He: “Eleven bucks for a tux! All this for Dorsey and his Band of Angels. Oh well, it might be
worth it to get Up Front.”

She: “My first college formal. I suppose everybody goes and stays real late. Seems like they’d be too pooped for
after-parties.”

He: “These Homecoming projects really look good. Hope dear old Davidson's animals put on as good a show this afternoon.”

She: “I think it’s so nice the pledges volunteer to do things like this. I guess they’ve got to do
something to occupy their time around this place.”

He: “Beat William and Mary. One of the better victories. But I'll just stay cool, like it happened every Saturday
in the fall.”

She: “Boy, what a great game. Now if he just doesn’t start in again on how they used to beat
Army and Duke...”

He: “Great Scott, Huey Smith and the Drifters both cancel out twelve hours before the concert. Well, Bill Haley and
the Comets are better than nothing.”

She: “Sure you’re having Peter, Paul, and Mary for Midwinters! Sure.”

He: “I'll be ruined for a month.”

She: “I'll be ruined for life.”

He: “Another after-party as wild as last night’s and I'll be ruined for life.”

She: “Well, she was a good date. Before I start pumping for those three reviews I'll write her a letter.
I want to date that kid again.”

She: “It all went so fast. I'll write a thank-you as soon as I get back. Maybe they will get
Peter, Paul, and Mary for Midwinters, and then maybe he’ll...”

**Ohio College Plan Offers More Freedom Of Choice**

Berea, O. — (I.P.) Required weekly assembly programs have been discontinued at Baldwin-Wallace College. A new system has been substituted
whereby students will receive one hour of college credit per year for attending a variety of out-of-class academic and cultural
events.

During each quarter, students will be required to attend ten events, chosen from at least five of the following seven
broad areas: music, art, drama, general humanities, religion, science, and social. There will also be two required assemblies per quarter
for the purpose of communicating with the student body in face-to-face situations and for traditional and essential convocations.

Faculty and student representatives on the committee strongly supported a program which would make the liberal arts mind more aware
of the cultural events and opportunities available on campus and favored the idea of offering greater freedom of choice on
the part of the students.

Tucson, Ariz. — (P.) — Inter-Fraternity Council scholarship sanctions will go into effect this year at the University of Arizona.
According to Dr. Edwin Gaines, Assistant Dean of Men and IFC adviser, “The sanctions will not only bring up the
all-fraternity average, but they will also bring up the all-men’s average.”

The sanctions apply to fraternities whose grade average falls below a 3.00. The measures include a letter written to the
fraternity's national office notifying them of their local chapter's scholarship status and pledging restrictions. If restricted, the house will only
be able to pledge men who were in the upper half of their high school graduating class, having a “C”
average in high school, or at least a 3.0 overall grade average at the University, or the equivalent of a
3.0 if they have transferred.

Measures to be taken for grade averages below 3.0 in subsequent semesters are:
- First semester—the fraternity will not be allowed to participate in such University-sponsored events as the Homecoming ceremonies, Spring Sing,
Varsity Show, and Greek Week Olympics.
- Second semester—the fraternity will lose all social privileges.
- Third semester—the fraternity will lose intramural privileges and will be placed on academic probation.
- Fourth semester—all activities except chapter meetings and internal affairs will be suspended, including rush privileges and IFC voting rights.
- Fifth semester—the fraternity’s local charter will be revoked.
