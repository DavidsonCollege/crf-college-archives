CATS CRUSH WOFFORD
(Continued from Page 3)
The Maroons threw a big scare into the sparsely filled gym by sporting a never-die team which roared back in the final stanza to come within two points of catching the Cat lead. The game never was on ice till the last three or four minutes when the Cats pulled ahead to a comfortable 12-point lead.

The Maroons jumped to a quick 8-5 lead after five minutes had elapsed but the tall white-clad boys held a 10-point lead at halftime.

Slick Mike Williams poured 19 points through the hoops to pace the Cat attack. Buddy Cheek rang the bell for 16 and Ed White hit for 13. George Peters swished the chords for 10.

And thus the squad runs. These boys will get their first test when they take on Furman in Greenville on March 29.

Ernie Stricklin, Carl Eborn, Bob Scharpe, and Fred Preyer were the standouts in the two forward walls, while Bud Fowle and Bob Walker turned in creditable performances from their blocking back posts. In addition to Sifford and Sheppard, Bert Anderton and Buck Williams won acclaim for their work in the punting and ball-carrying respectively.

game to go with the Independents. The outcome of that game will affect the standing of both those teams. If the Independents win, it assures them of a third place slot. If they lose, they will have a tie for fourth. But the battle will have very little effect on the Pi Kapps.

It seems that no matter what happens, they will move up one notch to fifth. Still in the cellar were the Phi Delts, the Kappa Sigs, and the Pikas.
