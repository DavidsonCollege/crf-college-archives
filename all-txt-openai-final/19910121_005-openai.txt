By now, the poster feud has become trite, and some things need to be made clear. It seems that the issue has divided itself into two sides: those who believe “PEACE DEMONSTRATIONS AGAINST THE MIDDLE EAST INVOLVEMENT HURT TROOP MORALE. IF OUR TROOPS LACK CONFIDENCE, MORE OF THEM WILL DIE!” and those who believe the opposite—that the demonstrations are not meant to shatter morale, just to end the war. It seems that the issue, then, becomes one of perception, that is, how one side perceives the other.

From reading the anti-peace-demonstration posters, one can learn: “This is not Viet Nam. Woodstock was 21 years ago! That era is gone, so grow up.” It is, therefore, obvious that the anonymous scribbler of the poster seems to associate peace demonstrations with the likes of Woodstock, which is the freedom of every anonymous scribbler—to perceive and utter such associations. After all, many styles of clothes of the 1960s have become fads in the 1980s, such as tie-dyes and sandals, giving every reason for every anonymous scribbler everywhere to make the association that just because certain persons wear the clothes of a fad, they are, by definition, faddish.

So granted. Perhaps the power of the peace march died at the point when an era, the 60s, manifested itself into trend, as we are led to believe through another anonymous scribbler who has written, “Sandals were made for the sand.” But though Woodstockian hippie clothe bearers will never not carry the label of their era, does it mean that any such present bearers—marching for peace—will have themselves and their goals nullified, simply because of what might be a historical clothing association on the part of a scribbler?

Suggestion for demonstrators: why not have a demonstration in which letters are written to our soldiers abroad? Not a letter writing. A rally. Why not have a peace rally at which every person wrote a letter to a soldier? Wave the flag, wear the clothes, write a letter. That way, maybe perceptions might change, and anonymous scribblers would stop and scratch their heads at what to do before they scribbled. Maybe they could broaden their passions for troop support to include an equal fervor for war’s end.

However, since perceptions will not change, we have time to think of the analogy of a mother and father screaming at each other while in between them is the kid too scared to cry. The anonymous scribbler says, “DON’T MAKE ITANOTHER VIET NAM. SUPPORT OUR TROOPS.” A peace movement carryover from the 60’s-70’s. And a soldier in the desert cries.

Letters

Peace Posters Spur Debate

To the Editors:

Like the poster version, this letter is not intended to stir up debate. I simply want to clear up a misunderstanding before it gets out of hand. I speak with confidence for those involved with peace efforts on campus because this is an issue we have often discussed. We gather and work for peace with the troops in mind, not out of antagonism for them. We understand that the men and women serving in the Gulf are doing a job. Our frustration is not with them, but with their boss. To support an individual does not mean one cannot disagree with those who control his or her life. We support the troops as individuals in an unimaginable circumstance and we disagree with the administration which has put them there.

We find ourselves faced with a difficult decision now. How do we work for peace in the midst of this war? The main alternative to war which we clung to, namely economic sanctions, has been taken away. Now that it has begun, we can only hope that it ends quickly. But to support this action presupposes that one believes that it is a worthy alternative. To support this war even now is to support war as a means of conflict resolution. The alternative we choose is to gather for peace. We gather because we believe that war cannot and must not be set as the precedent for conflict resolution. We gather because we too have a vision for the “new world order” -- a world in which open dialogue replaces threat and in which diplomacy, patience, and compassion are noble attributes of a nation’s leader. We gather because we want the men and women to come home safely.

This is not Vietnam. This is not a 60’s and 70’s peace movement carry-over. We have a new message: one of peace for and solidarity with those whose lives are most seriously threatened now. We are very sensitive to the condition of our troops in the Gulf, and we do not mean to turn our backs on them in any way. In Washington, we will carry two banners that read, “Peace. We Support Our Troops Alive. Bring Them Home.”
