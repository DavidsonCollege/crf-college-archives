**SIGMA CHI REACTS**  
Size Decrease, The Coterie obviously is not exactly what Sigma Chi used to be. From 20 to 25 former members have recently gone inactive, but explains Fox Demoisey, those local, but because of the disorganization which followed, according to Walker, “those favoring local, once they gained local status, took a positive rather than a negative one according to Kroll. “Being a local house, those who want to affiliate with a local might be interested in an organization such as ours, function as in the past. We have revised our social outlook, but there will be a party Saturday. There is an organized redoing of the house to give it a new look, but optimistic about the situation right now.”

**BULLETIN!**  
Davidson Football Coach Homer Smith last night refused to comment on rumors of his resignation and also denied the rumor that an ineligible player might cause Davidson to forfeit its conference football championship and a trip to the Tangerine Bowl. After a closed team meeting last night, numerous grumblings in the past 24 hours have caused widespread student concern over the possibility. Smith had no comment on the rumors. For some time there has been speculation that Smith, who has long fought the battle for subsidized athletics, would resign at the end of the current season.

**COTERIE AT THE CROSSROADS**  
Schafer says that the committee is preparing a new constitution and bylaws. We have reworked our system and are intent on making the effort successful. There is now a feeling that everyone wants to work and do something for the house. The people left are of one mind. There are no more divisions and our goals are unified. Going local was thought of as a measure to keep the house together because of a tremendous decline in morale. There resulted, an incredible absenteeism at meetings. Many have gone inactive for various personal reasons, not all connected with the fraternity’s disaffiliation with its national organization. Various ex-Coterie members, including Walt Willker, Jack Latimer, and Bill Schafer, who voted to go local, have also joined the pre-nationals. The sophomores especially wanted to hold the house together, but they finally found out it was useless.

**FOR SGA**  
SGA President Peter Hobbie is planning to propose that the Davidson SGA rejoin the National Student Association. “I think Davidson can gain by membership in a national student organization which sees student problems from both the local and national level,” Hobbie said, adding that there is a good chance that the SGA Senate will approve membership when the issue comes up. According to Hobbie, there are two NSA officers at the University of North Carolina, who would be happy to come down in January to discuss the advantages of membership. The Senate will also attempt to line up an opponent of the NSA, perhaps Davidson alumnus Joe Beard, now at Chapel Hill, to present the other side of the picture. On Wednesday the Senate debated inviting a spokesman in favor of NSA membership, but Hobbie did not request that funds be appropriated to pay the speakers' expenses. Instead of allotting $80 for that purpose, a figure which had been felt prohibitive, the Senate voted to appropriate $20 to reprint pro and con magazine articles from “Moderator” and “New Guard,” along with a statement from Hobbie. Both are student magazines: “The New Guard” is the official periodical of the Americans for Free.

**COLLEGE OFFICIALS ANNOUNCE COMPUTER CHANGE**  
Davidson College will replace its seven-year-old IBM 1620 computer with a new NCR Century 100, college officials announced today. The new system will include a printer with a capacity of 450 lines per minute, and two magnetic disk packs for the storage of 4 million characters of information each. “The 1620 has done a lot of work for us,” commented Dr. Jerry A. Roberts, associate professor of mathematics and director of the college's computer operations. “But computers have come a long way in seven years, and we all need a more advanced system to demonstrate to students operations possible on more sophisticated equipment.” Stephenson said that the new system would be located in the same area as the old one. Some of its other features include: -Standardized memory units and logic circuits, meaning easier servicing. -Fast information retrieval through sophisticated electronic ‘reading’ equipment. -Basic memory units of 32,768 characters: rods coated with thin magnetic material instead of the dead cores. -More flexibility in institutional research, analysis of educational programs, etc. -Speedier registration and scheduling of classes, giving staff members more time to spend with students and supplying students and professors with information more quickly.

Reflecting upon his past months in office, Hobbie noted that while no major legislation has passed the Senate, all is going well on the committees that he has appointed: the Educational Review Committee. This recommendation was passed in the Senate last week and now goes to the faculty for approval. Early last Friday morning at Arlington National Cemetery, SGA President Peter Hobbie and several other Davidson College Students stood waiting in the cold November wind to begin the March Against Death. The continuous parade of marchers, each walking silently with the name of a soldier who died in Vietnam, began at 8:15. They crossed Arlington Memorial Bridge into Washington, D.C., and passed the White House on the way to the Capitol. Peter Hobbie said that he has counted fifteen to twenty Davidson students who participated. There was no heckling except for one or two catcalls, and a middle-aged man with a sign saying, “Would you protest to Hanoi and really end this war?” Office workers peered down out of their fifth-story windows, and some simply went sightseeing. As the marchers passed by the front of the White House, each shouted out the name he was carrying. Then they took off their placards and placed them in unpainted pine coffins. Along the way, marchers made the peace sign to pedestrians, passing motorists, and casual observers. Once, a group of Negroes returned them more enthusiastically. Saturday’s main anti-war activity was a mass march and rally at the Washington Monument. By 8 a.m. large crowds of people had already gathered.Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:
