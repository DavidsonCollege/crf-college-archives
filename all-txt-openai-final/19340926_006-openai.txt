6, THE DAVIDSONIAN, SEPTEMBER 26, 1934

summer, was the much-needed work on the Y building. New floors were put in and the walls were done over in attractive wallpaper. New curtains were added and the whole appearance of the reading room was changed. We sincerely hope that students will feel free to come in and use these rooms as much as possible. However, we also ask that you be especially careful and try to keep the building looking as clean as possible. Magazines are kept at all times in the reading room, and please do not take them up to the dormitories. The Y will greatly appreciate the cooperation of all the students in this.

Under New Management:
The Carolina Inn is under new management and we would like for you to try us. The food is inexpensive but not cheap. Mrs. Otto Goodnight, New Manager.

GOLF, TENNIS PROVIDED:
Davidson College has seemingly outdone itself this past summer in repairing the grounds and equipment, but these changes are small in comparison with the improvements of the last few years. Chambers Building itself is, of course, the outstanding monument of the progress of the decade. This center of college activity, despite minor imperfections, exemplifies the most up-to-date architecture of its type.

The next improvement of importance is the development of the east area of the campus. Less than eight years ago, the fraternity court was a mass of briars and bushes interspersed with shrubby undergrowth, the rumored location of the "pest house" of Davidson medical students in days of yore. In those days the five fraternities, Phi Gamma Delta, Pi Kappa Alpha, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Kappa Sigma, and Kappa Alpha had unbelievable conditions.

The above directory is given in the above manner for the convenience of the students as the houses have no numbers. The direction is taken as going from the campus to the house.

Ten years ago there was no golf course, for that area was the location of the present Concord Road. This road left North Main, passed Dormitory Row and the Seifert home, and wended its way across the hills and waterways of the golf course. This course is the result of much effort on the part of the College and is still being improved and modernized.

The fourteen tennis courts were constructed more recently by the College, at an expense of $8,000. The clay was carefully selected so as to make a set of courts resistant to variable forms of weather. The former tennis courts, few in number, were located between New Chambers and Concord Street, and on the corner opposite the church. The wall literally binding the campus, and extending from the North Gate down Main Street, Concord Street, and around to Mrs. N. T. Smith's former home was constructed from the remnants of Old Chambers. It seems from these improvements that Davidson College was a very different place a decade ago—a college with very few of the modern conveniences that we take as a matter of course. The College has expended much time and effort in providing a fit setting for its cultural activity.

Invitation Received By College From Kuester

A standing invitation to make the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce their headquarters was issued to Davidson students in a letter recently received from C. O. Kuester, executive vice-president of the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce, located at 123 W. Fourth St. in Charlotte. Quoting Mr. Kuester: “The Charlotte Chamber of Commerce, as you well know, is exceedingly proud of your institution, and we always receive genuine pleasure when we can do anything for the College or Student Body.” After wishing the Presbyterian institution a successful year, Kuester ends his letter with a postscript, “Only wish I were young enough to attend there, myself.” Kuester has two sons, Faison, of the Class of '37, C. O. Kuester, Jr., enrolled in the class of '38.

Y.M.C.A. News

VESPERS: The two vesper programs for the new year have been very fine. The speakers have been intensely interesting and each has had a message of vital importance to young men. However, the attendance at these meetings has not been as well as it should be. A fairly large crowd was present at the first meeting, but there was a considerable fall in attendance the past Sunday evening. The “Y” goes to a lot of trouble and expense to secure these men and we should be willing and glad to help out by attending these services. Not only that, but you will receive thoughts there which are helpful and stimulating and inspiring. Let's all be there next Sunday evening and receive a real benefit from the service!

DEPUTATIONS: It is hoped that work on deputations will soon be started. As yet, not much work has been done along this line this year, but some will probably be sent out next Sunday. Also it is hoped that the Sunday School work will be underway by next Sunday. If you are interested in working in either of these phases of Y work, see the members of the Cabinet who have charge of the work and they will try to get something for you to do.
