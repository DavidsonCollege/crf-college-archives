Announcement

Environmental Conference

An environmental conference will be held at Davidson March 3-7. This week-long gathering of politicians, environmentalists, researchers, and students will
raise questions about the state of the environment, its importance to us, and how everyone can help preserve it. As
part of this event, sponsored by The Dean Rusk Program through a grant provided by NCNB Corporation, there will be
an art show in the Student Union. Both visual and written art works are welcome from students and faculty. Paintings,
drawings, photographs, poems, short stories - anything!

The main topics of the conference are Population, Resource Bases, Native Americans, Rainforest, and the Coastal Environment. These are suggested
topics to focus on, but not guidelines for the artwork. If you have a proposal or any questions, please contact
Ruth Pittard at x2192 or Meg Hoyle at x6649.
