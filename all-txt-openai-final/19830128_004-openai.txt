**ROTC Draws Blood**

The Mecklenburg County Red Cross last week awarded a plaque to the Davidson Scabbard & Blade ROTC honor society for
“collecting the largest number of pints for this size of enrollment,” during their blood drive held on 2 November 1982,
according to Brad McCall who ran the drive. Davidson came first in a Red Cross contest among eleven Mecklenburg County
colleges including Pfeiffer, UNCC, and Queens. The drive netted 296 pints from 342 people.

**Snowed in but few problems**

By TIM MCGAUGHEY ’85

Davidson, North Carolina received 1.5 inches of snow and ice on Friday, January 21. The snow, which later turned to
freezing rain, coated the campus with a crust of ice. Damages in the town and around the campus were modest.
No power outages occurred and there was no property damage. The Grounds Crew removed snow, swept pathways to prevent accidents,
and cleaned up a couple of fallen tree limbs. In the town of Davidson, there were few problems. A pair
of fender benders occurred Friday and Saturday with little damage to any party.

**No Midwinters Concert**

By JEFFREY MANN ’84

There will be no concert at this year’s Mid-Winters Big Weekend for the first time in recent memory. Brice Street,
a local rock band, will play in the 900 Room Saturday night with no cover charge. Union Concert Committee Chairman
Jim Hoskins said the Committee had decided on booking Warren Zevon, but “it fell through at the last minute.” Hoskins
said, “There was also some hesitation on spending as much money as he wanted.” Union Director C. Shaw Smith, who
dealt with the agent, said, “We piddled around a little bit, but the way I understand it, we never had
a date. I asked him if we could have had him if we’d called earlier, and he said no.” Hoskins
said the committee will put the money towards the Spring Frolics concert or an additional concert this term. REM, an
Athens-based recording group whose “Chronic Town” EP has been number one on WDAV’s Flipside playlist, is tentatively scheduled for Saturday,
5 February in the 900 Room. Smith said the Union has had trouble booking “name” bands because of competition from
commercial promoters. “The only reason we’ve been successful in the past is because we’ve gotten in early,” he said. “There
is a great value in getting ‘name’ entertainment on campus. We want to be able to tell people someone’s coming
and let them look forward to it.”

**304 Books Lost**

The Davidson College Library found 304 books missing in this year’s inventory according to Library Director Leland Parks, in a
memo addressed to the “College family.” This figure is up from 267 last year, and 248 the year before. Parks
said, “the loss rate is 3/10 of one percent. . . . These are enviable rates vis a vis our
sister institutions.” A sample of some of the missing books includes the 1957 Quips and Cranks, E.F. Schumacher’s Guide to
the Perplexed, H.I. Montoye’s Longevity and Morbidity in College Athletes, and volume 62 of the Davidsonian.

**25 at Y meeting**

By TIM MCGAUGHEY ’85

Chris Blake, Vice President of the Y Student Service Corps, reported that the Y had their meeting with 25 members
this weekend. Because of the snow, the Y had its meeting on campus instead of in the mountains. At this
meeting, the Y tried to establish goals and set priorities for the coming year. Chris Blake will announce these goals
for the Y in the coming week.

**Hobart Park**

By BRIAN BUTLER ’84

“It should be safe to say,” according to Hobart Park Editor Eric Fichner, “that the winter edition of the student-written
and published art forum will be out next week.”Eric says the magazine may contain some unexpected modes of artwork, including
sheet music by Bill Heard, a book review by Economics Professor Emeritus Ernie Patterson, and a series of reflections on
an art exhibit by one of Gill Holland’s freshman composition classes. Suzanne Dickey, recently elected new Hobart Park editor, served
as assistant editor of the publication. English professors Gill Holland and Tony Abbott read the material and made suggestions, while
Debby Williams, Bitsy Pomeroy, Jenna Buckner, and Darrell Cooper served as student readers. 750 copies are being printed. They will
soon be available for free around campus and thereabouts.

EPC finds daily schedule ‘feasible’
By RICK AVERY ’86

A sub-committee of the Educational Policies Committee has examined the Semester Planning Committee’s proposed daily schedule for the future semester
system at Davidson College and found it to be “feasible.” The sub-committee, headed by Registrar Dr. Richards C. Burts, was
set up to examine the SPC’s daily schedule and to determine its viability. Exact details of the schedule could not
be released because, according to Dr. Burts, the schedule is a “first-attempt” and “a lot of questions are still open.”
He added that the general opinion is that the proposed schedule has the “equitable dispersal of courses throughout the day”
that the system should have in order to avoid class conflicts in scheduling. Dr. Burts does not expect a finished
schedule until next fall or winter. The target date for the switch-over to the semester system at Davidson College is
currently set at 1984.

The wraparound cover design, cast in an unlikely manilla shade, is by Blair Maxwell and is entitled “Altered Landscapes.” The
cover will wrap around poetry by Roy Fuller, David Resnik, Suzanne Dickey, and Debby Williams, short fiction by John Marks,
Barry Elledge, and Cathy Grotto, and artwork by Pat Donley and Curlin Reed. Works by three non-students, Gill Holland, Tony
Abbott, and Mrs. Cathy Warren will also be included. Eric received enough material to fill 350 pages. The budget, however,
holds the size to 80 pages per term. When a single artist submits a large quantity of superior work, the
editor is faced with a real dilemma: should the magazine try to span a wide variety of personalities, or should
the magazine print the best material? Eric says that this issue tries to bring a compromise between the two attitudes.
He first chose the best material, and then filled in with the best of the worst, so to speak.

Kluttz Resigns
By RICK AVERY ’86

Officer Harold Kluttz resigned from the Davidson Police Department last month and will be replaced at the end of the
month. Kluttz resigned voluntarily in order to join the Pineville Police Force, according to Davidson Police Chief Jack Warlick. He
said that Kluttz lives near Pineville and took the job in order to be closer to home. There is no
truth to the rumor that Officer Kluttz was fired because of complaints or suits filed against him or the Town
of Davidson, he emphasized, adding that Kluttz was “a good cop and a good patrolman.” Kluttz came to work for
the Davidson Police Department in September of 1980. He was formerly employed with the Charlotte Park Police. Kluttz will be
replaced by Officer Raymond Thrower Jr. Thrower is an experienced officer with three years of prior law enforcement experience. He
has worked for the Iredell County Sheriff’s Department and the Mooresville Police Department. He has an Associate’s Degree in Criminal
Justice from Central Piedmont Community College and is currently working on his Bachelor’s Degree at Pfeifer College. He will start
work January 28.
