**Win-Starved Apps Topple Cats**

**Favored Paladins Fall, 58-52**

“Let me have men about me that are fat;
Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o’ nights:
Yond Cassius hath a lean and hungry look;
He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.”

—Caesar from Shakespeare’s “Julius Caesar”

After Tuesday night’s 60-58 overtime embarrassment at the hands of win-starved Appalachian State, Bobby Hussey knows that such teams are dangerous.

The Wildcats, coming off two fat wins over Notre Dame and Furman, were, as Bobby Hussey put it, “flat as a worn-out pancake.” The Mountaineers, coming off a double overtime loss to 2-10 Milligan College (who?) of the NAIA, were lean and hungry for the win. Combine those factors with the fact that Davidson was looking past the Apps to tomorrow night’s game at UT-Chattanooga, and you come up with trouble.

“We just weren’t prepared, that’s all there was to it,” senior forward Brian Rowan admitted later.

“We sleepwalked for about 40 minutes, woke up briefly in the five-minute overtime, and then went back to sleep again,” Hussey said of what he called “a very miserable night” for him and his team. “We had tons and tons of opportunities to win the game. We just didn’t take advantage of any of them.”

Cantwell, on the other hand, was elated with his very young (no seniors, eight freshmen) team’s play. “We’ve got an identity now,” he said. “It’s amazing what 48 hours can do. I’ve over-coached these guys. Tonight I just said take it to the hoop.”

The Apps, thanks often to their own hard play and more often to Davidson’s lax defensive play, did that plenty as time after time they came up with uncontested layups and second shots. They outrebounded the lackluster Wildcats a resounding 35-22. In short, they just plain outplayed the Wildcats.

In the first half, Davidson led only once by as many as four points, as the Mountaineers bullied and battled for every break they could get. Just past midway of the half when Hussey was sure that his starters weren’t playing well, he substituted in some shock troops — Gerry Born and Rafael Hernandez for Cliff Tribus, and Frank Johnson for Rowan. Even so, the Wildcats could only scrape together a scant 26-24 halftime lead.

The brief hiatus to the bench did the starters little good. It appeared to have fanned their fires a bit when, by the 17:16 mark, Davidson had built a 34-28 lead. The six-point margin didn’t last long, and the Wildcats were mired in a basket-for-basket battle before they knew it.

With 3:53 left and the score tied 45-45, Kenny Wilson hit the first of two free throws, but missed the second only to have the ball go off ASU hands. Davidson chose patience as its best course and as Appalachian showed a stifling triangle-and-two defense. The defense effectively neutralized the inside threats of Tribus and Kenny Wilson as it kept the ball on the perimeter. Finally, Rod Davis fouled Rowan with 1:27 left, and the senior hit both ends of the one-and-one to give the Cats a 48-45 lead.

What appeared to be a safe lead turned about completely on two defensive breakdowns on the other end. The first came as David Lawrence slipped by and then was fouled by Richard Wilson while shooting. He missed the free throw, but Davis found himself all alone in the lane for the rebound and the easy lay-in as Tribus fouled him. Davis missed his free throw with 1:07 left to hold the ASU lead at 49-48.

On Davidson’s next possession, Tribus missed an open 18-footer from the right baseline, and the rebound glanced off Richard Wilson out of bounds.

Andy Black wound up with a fast break off a long pass, but John Carroll fouled him to save the easy basket. It didn’t work out, as he hit both free throws to put ASU on top 51-48 with :40 left.

John Carroll took the ball down-court with one object in mind, and he hit it — a three-pointer with :21 left to tie the game. The defense then placed a moratorium on disaster when it held up a last-second Appalachian shot.

Free throws were the story of overtime as ASU built a 60-55 lead on them with :43 left. Carroll took a slice out of that with his second three-pointer to close the gap to 60-58 with :35 remaining.

Appalachian got another fast break on an inbounds, but Carroll darted out of nowhere to pick off the would-be game-winning assist, but on neither of two tries could the Wildcats capitalize on a three-pointer. Had they been able to, it wouldn’t have been fair to the young Mountaineers, who had played so well.

At the same time, however, it didn’t help Davidson, which dropped to 7-6 overall and 3-1 in the S.C. as they go into Chattanooga tomorrow night and host powerful ETSU Monday night in Johnston Gym. As Rowan pointed out, “Every time we take two steps forward, we take one step backward.”

The Wildcats can take a big step forward with one or two wins these next few days.

“Winning is so much fun,” Tom Franz said on the way back from a 58-52 win over Furman in Greenville, S.C. The win, which further entrenched the Wildcats at the top of the Southern Conference, was their second conference victory.
