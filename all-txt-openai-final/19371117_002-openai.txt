Even though it may be impudent to discredit that explanation, there is another that editors often must admit to themselves.
And that is, that as a class editors are about the worst plagiarists in captivity, and very little of what
they write merits the first person pronoun. The editor reads and talks and listens to countless expressions of ideas. He
may scan a dozen exchanges commenting upon some news of the day, and talk to a dozen more persons about
it. He gets letters and hears radio commentators. And then when he gets around to writing a piece of his
own, his mind is a jumble of many contributions. Very little of what he produces is his own, except the
arrangement.

Consequently, when the editor writes "we" he may not only be seeking anonymity but also he may be paying unconscious
homage to the ideas that have come to him in one way or another from others. Maybe the editor is
thus trying to give credit he cannot place more accurately. Perhaps it might be well for all persons expressing opinions
to say “we think so.”

For A King. Day By CHUBBY KING

“At last, after weeks of unceasing endeavor and much hardship and loss of respectability on part of the Kang, he
finally cornered Horseplay Hill and sought photographic evidence of the latter's known disreputable character—strong traces of which can be seen
clearly in this little candid shot. However, unfortunately, Kang of necessity sacrificed his own seraphic features to depths and secured
this remarkable likeness to vice personified—in one hill of low repute. He only begs forgiveness for this irremovable blemish against
himself and requests that you have discerning eyes only for the contorted wretch!”

Lyons renews past close friendship with Teeney Cooke... Sea Wright very much at sea when fortune smiled in form of
a beautiful bus companion—in fact, he was so stricken that he failed to meet the young lady altogether. Perry Sloan

Washington, D. C. — Compulsory military training in colleges — particularly land grant colleges which receive federal funds — is
often the target for criticism by peace organizations. However, the way in which our college students are, in some instances,
forced to take military training contrasts strongly with the manner in which young men are trained for war in foreign
countries. In Switzerland, Italy, France, Rumania, Peru, Germany, Algeria and Iraq all young men are compelled to undergo a period
of military training. And this is not in conjunction with college work. They have to serve a year or more
in the army, just as do regular soldiers. Military service in Turkey is regarded as so important that it is
practically impossible for a young man to get a job unless he has completed his military term.

Around Washington
By Marvin Cox (A. C. P. Correspondent)

Co-eds are not always omitted in training for the national defense in other nations. For instance, the Woman's Home Defense
Organization in Estonia trains young women for their part in war through an organization called the Home Guards. The Boy
Scouts organizations in some countries have been drafted as military training agencies. Boy Scouts in Brazil, for instance, are financed
by the government and receive training for war under the Ministry of War. Military training is compulsory in Argentina between
the ages of 18 and 21. However, all youths are not required to undergo the training. Lots are drawn and
the trainees are selected in this manner. So, after considering the compulsory military service of more militaristic nations, drill two
or three times a week in college ROTC units may not be so bad after all.

without considerable discussion pro and con. Moir Halt and Jerry Harris expressed themselves as definitely in favor of the proposition
as it seemed to offer the only way out of the present situation. Leonard Fort also expressed himself as in
favor of the motion. Bronston Kenney stood on the negative side, affirming that in his opinion the college would never
abolish dances, and that it was unfair to place such a small portion of the student body in such a
great position of responsibility. Bruce Parcell supported Bronston Kenney’s second statement. Watson Street struck a new note when he suggested
that the drinking problem be put under the honor system. Kellog and Fielding Clark of the senior class, also offered
comments. Monroe Wicker then called for the question and the student body by a large majority approved the motion with
a standing vote.

Sunday School Attendance

Try rising early, ye multifarious sinners, and get in on fine program especially designed for your entertainment and benefit. It
only means sacrifice of approximately one hour’s sleep, which loss will probably triple in value to you. Colonel Liipfert according
to close female observer, possesses boudoir eyes—an excellent stimulator.

recreation center would help. We have one, yes, one pool table and one ping-pong table with cracked paddles. What is
there to stay here for? It's only natural that the boys “want to get away from it all” so to
speak. And if in such an atmosphere we get restless, whose fault is it? I'm asking, not telling. Give us
something to do over the weekends, it would save our money and perhaps we could pay a little on our
pledges. (perhaps).

THUMB NAIL SKETCH—From the ridiculous to the sublime. A freshman last week, a senior this time. And what a senior.
He is a fraternity man and the idol of the pledge group. His time is divided between The Little Pep,
Concord and Richardson Field. Weighing little more than one hundred and fifty pounds he is an iron man with no
flies. A great friend of Louie Mark, State College center. Incidentally he is president of the athletic association and very
popular with the student body. He will come when called either “Kapanonis” or “Big Gun.” Much more could be said
but is it necessary?
