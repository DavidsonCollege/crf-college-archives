Jones’ knee is not alone

By MICHAEL KRUSE
Sports Editor

Sewanee, Tenn. - Sophomore Wes Jones, who injured his knee late in the Maryville win, probably has an ACL tear and will likely take a medical redshirt this season if that’s the case. Jones said that his doctor was “95 percent sure” that there was a tear, but that he would know for sure after another appointment today.

But Jones may now have company on the sidelines. Senior co-captain and defensive stalwart A.R. Barrington went down in the second half on punt coverage against Sewanee and appears to have torn his ACL too.

Moll runs wild

Sophomore tailback Lorenzo Moll’s 25-carry, 134-yard performance in the season opener placed him ninth in the nation in Division I-AA rushing. Moll, who recorded 77 yards on Saturday despite sitting out the fourth quarter with a concussion, is on pace to post a 1,000-yard season.

Senior wide receiver Kirk Roberts, with 29 catches this season, would become the tenth player in school history to catch 100 passes. Roberts, who made 34 and 35 catches in 1994 and 1995, respectively, caught one ball against Maryville and three on Saturday.

Senior co-captain John Cowan started his 32nd game in a row on Saturday. Barring injury this fall, the ironman lineman will finish his Wildcat career having started all 40 possible contests.

Male harriers place third at Catamount Classic

By AARON DUNHAM
Staff Writer

The Davidson men’s cross country team pulled in a respectable showing at this past weekend’s Catamount Classic, finishing third among three other Southern Conference foes at Western Carolina University. The team showed great improvement, according to coach Gary Andrew, from their first meet two weeks ago when they placed

this season, the media bitches and moans about another freakin’ year, another worthless team, another trophy-less Fenway Park lobby. When the Sox start 11-3 or something like that, it’s not Wow-these-Sox-are-good-and-they’re-going-all-the-way-forget-that-Curse-of-the-Bambino-nonsense. It’s There-they-go-again-getting-up-our-hopes-and-dreams-only-to-set-us-up-for-another-late-season-crumble-as-they-squash-everything-we’ve-ever-lived-for. If the Sox ever actually win the Fall Classic, the papers are not going to break the news for weeks in fear of baseball’s figureheads changing some fundamental rule of the game and taking away the title. So Panthers fans, I don’t care if you beat the damn 49ers. You’re still an expansion team. And you’re still not going to win the Super Bowl. So there.

— fifth in the Appalachian Meet in Blowing Rock. Appalachian State won the dual meet outright, finishing ahead of host Western Carolina. The Wildcat harriers placed third, followed by The Citadel. For the second straight meet, junior Josh Cookson led Davidson finishing eighth. Freshman William Isenhour finished fourteenth in just his second collegiate race. Other top finishers for the Wildcats were Rick Cratensburg (20th), Pat Burchett (23rd), and team captain Dave Foss (26th). Foss was pleased with the team’s performance. “It was a solid meet and a definite learning experience,” Foss said. “The (Western Carolina) course is the Southern Conference Championship course and we wanted to race on it before the championships.” The Wildcats had four more runners place among the top thirty finishers.

There’s no place like home

Men's soccer coach Charlie Slagle has reason to worry about Davidson’s road play. While the Wildcats are 5-0 at home, they are just 1-3 when playing away from the Richardson Field confines. That lone victory came against St. Mary’s (Calif.) in a game played in Las Vegas. “The ability to play on the road is what separates the good from the-not-so-good teams,” Slagle said. “We’ll see if this team can do it.”

Slagle has been pleased with the play of senior goalkeeper Matt Hill. Hill, who played in the shadow of Alex Deegan during the first three years of his college career, has played well in his first full season in the starting slot. “Matt has really progressed nicely,” Slagle said. “He is the leader of a very solid defense.” As expected, Robert Clarke and Phil Julien have emerged as the team’s leading goal-scorers. They are currently tied for the lead with four apiece.

When Kelly Ammann scored in the 62nd minute against the College of Charleston on Sunday, it was the first goal by a non-freshman player this season for the women's soccer team. Ginny Dye leads the team in goals with three, Kelly Rennick has two, Amy Balsinger one, and Angie Boyer one.
