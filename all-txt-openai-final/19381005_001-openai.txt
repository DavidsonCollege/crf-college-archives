Old Telephone Building to House New Davidson Recreation Spot

Biggest Dance Set of Year Will Be Staged Early in February

Dr. Redhead Also Leader of Y.M.C.A. Exercises

The Pan-Hellenic Council announced yesterday that they are negotiating either Jimmy Dorsey or Kay Kayser to play for the Mid-Winter dance set to be held the second week-end in February. All of the well-known orchestras of the east so far approached have reported themselves under contract and that they will be unable to go under a long-term contract at Davidson. Other bands have similar extended engagements. Raymond Pittman, president of this year's council, announced, however, their intentions of signing some well-known band to play for the dance set. They will continue to look for some suitable orchestra.

A new bowling alley will be opened here in the old telephone building the latter part of this week or early next week. According to the owners, Mr. Manning and Mr. Freeman, from Bennettsville, S.C., there will be four new alleys with the necessary number of ducts and pins. The owners have also set a tentative price of ten cents a game per person.

This will be quite an addition to Davidson, since there are no other spots operated solely for the purpose of entertainment and sport. The new bowling alley might get results in keeping boys on the campus during the weeknights. Last year quite a number of boys were interested in bowling and even went so far as to arrange scheduled matches among different groups. This was soon dropped after a few games, however, due to the fact that the players either had to go to Charlotte or to Mooresville to play their matches. Later on in the year the scheduled matches that were dropped last year will probably be resumed with a much larger number of boys participating.

Dr. Redhead will be making his second appearance on the Davidson campus in this capacity. The Charlotte minister conducted the Spring Services of the local Y.M.C.A. during the school year of 1934-35. "Mac" McClure, now pastor of the Lincolnton church, was then serving his first year as "Y" secretary. Dr. Redhead is a native of Mississippi and graduated from Southwestern University with the class of 1926. During his college days he made letters in both football and basketball. After graduating from Southwestern, Dr. Redhead continued his ministerial training at the Union Theological Seminary in Richmond, Va. He was awarded the Hodge Fellowship for the year 1929-30.

The widely known Little Philharmonic Orchestra under the direction of George H. Shapiro will play a concert in Chambers Auditorium at 8:15 on Friday evening. Mr. Shapiro is recognized as a musician of outstanding merit at Davidson, as his orchestra played a concert here last year. This is sponsored by the Davidson Music Department, which invites any outsiders who are interested in music.

Local stage talent will get its big chance Thursday, Oct. 21, when Selznick International Picture Company sends a scout to Davidson to observe the Red and Black Masquers. The Red and Black Masquers will present on this date the following plays: "Where The Cross Is Made" by Eugene O'Neil; "Dead Souls" by Hall and Middlemack, and a comedy. The third title will be announced next week. All students interested in competing for parts are requested by Miss Kalista Hood, who has had Broadway experience and previous connections with the Selznick International, to meet themselves with the scripts. Tryouts will be held Friday night at 8:30 o'clock in the Beta Theta Pi fraternity house. Any person who would like to arrange an interview with Miss Hood is asked to see her at once.

The Davidson College Symphonic Orchestra presented a concert over Station WBT. The concert will be given by the Little Philharmonic Orchestra under the direction of George H. Shapiro, well-known symphonic director. All Davidson students will be admitted free and Professor Pfohl, head of the music department, stressed the fact that he hoped all students will take advantage of the opportunity to hear the music of this well-known orchestra. Shapiro has visited the college before and is well known here.MUA UCoIGIIATT Aide Grech presidents of the social fraternities | tions should be in before Oct. 15, ; e ; C= schics = co. weekly broadcasts r ano ay, Whe yore s a, echo Bhi | tions to the club for their success- Suicheaui lateral d are mlecias Application to the local commit-|sensus of the student body, this Mn Ate NO eicoca Tia Unit A ind to their Pan-Hellenic repre-]|as the council will meet on f orf ance f hi ay las ' - ‘ Pricer vy » made » of-| cour as re red i i > ser- | eden : i rT Si | date to map out their schedule ful performances of his play last night from 9 to 9:30 over W BT, | te¢ should not be made on the of |‘ ourt ha rendered invaluable CheGratcs Ali tava cwontdistiictoll n Dean Mat ntell t 1 1 spring and has sent autographed Giatint y ficial blank, but in the form of a| vice.
