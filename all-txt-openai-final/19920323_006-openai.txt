Quiet Continued from page 1

(1) Do you feel that noise is a problem on the hall?
(2) How many times this school year has a student expressed concern about noise on the hall to you?
(3) Do you feel that the current policy for addressing excessive noise on the hall is appropriate and adequate?

Cook and Harkness found that “the results of our survey deem further resolutions about quiet hours/dorms unwarranted and unnecessary.” He
said: “We (Cook and Harkness) feel that establishing quiet dorms would be detrimental to renewing the ‘spirit of community’ alluded
to by Dr. Kuykendall in his recent letter to the college community. Quiet dorms would also avoid the root problem:
disrespect and intolerance for others.”

A second survey was distributed to the entire student body on March 10 by Residence Life Director Richard Terry. 48%
of the student body completed the survey. Terry concluded from the survey that “the number of students saying they would
opt for a quiet dorm/floor is so small [7%] as to make setting up quiet halls impractical. 49% of those
completing the survey took the time to make comments and over 90% of those saw the issue as overblown, a
non-issue, misdirected energy, the faculty nosing in on students’ lives, etc. Terry also proposed a “better advised strategy for dealing
with noise in residence halls.”

Dr. Alexander McKelway, a member of the Faculty Executive Council, asserted that “students have the fundamental right to live under
the conditions they want. Students have the belief that the faculty is forcing quiet halls on them. This conception couldn’t
be farther from the truth. You would always have to offer fewer spots [on a quiet hall] than there are
requests for, so that no one would have to live on a quiet hall without wanting to.”

If the faculty will ever vote on the quiet dorm/hall issue, McKelway responded that the faculty will not vote on
the issue because, constitutionally, they do not have any power over student life. Ultimately, McKelway believes that the faculty’s goal
is being misrepresented. McKelway explained that “we [FEC] are urging that those students that want to live on a quiet
hall be allowed to do so.” McKelway believes that there are more students than were shown in Richard Terry’s survey
that would like to live on a quiet hall. He also suggested that if quiet halls were established, the students
living on them should make their own set of rules concerning noise. The unrest over the quiet dorms/halls issue seems
to have arisen through a lack of communication between the students, faculty, and administration.
