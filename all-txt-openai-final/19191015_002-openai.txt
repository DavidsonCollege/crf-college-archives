**Future Opponents**

Here’s how our future opponents came out:
- South Carolina was defeated by the University of Georgia 14-0.
- Georgia Tech defeated Clemson 28-0.
- State College defeated the Hampton Roads Naval Base 100-0.
- Furman beat Wofford 7-6.
- Yale beat North Carolina 34-7.

South Carolina showed marked improvement Saturday over their previous playing. Although outweighed by the heavy Georgia eleven, they were able
to hold them to two touchdowns, one being made during the first few minutes of the first quarter and the
second in the last few minutes of the game. A misunderstanding among the timekeepers allowed the first quarter to run
for thirty-seven minutes, which helped to tire the lighter eleven. "Osticelum" White, the big center for Davidson on the famous
1916 squad, was one of the officials at the game.

If a close score shows anything about a game, the Vanderbilt-Tennessee affair must have been some scrap. It is unfortunate
that these old rivals locked horns so early in the season and under such unfavorable weather conditions. There was a
continual downpour of rain from start to finish and the game was staged in a young lake. In spite of
the wet field, Josh Cady, the all-Southern tackle of 1916, registered a drop kick from the 30-yard line, while Hatcher,
from the 25-yard line, did the same for Tennessee, leaving the score 3-3, which was the final count.

Similar to this game from the standpoint of score was the Furman-Wofford battle in Greenville. The Methodists had the edge
in weight but were outplayed by the Baptists, who really deserved the game. This leaves Furman with a record of
two victories and one defeat, the latter being administered by the Georgia Tech eleven.

The Yale-Carolina game was characterized by loose playing and frequent fumbling on both sides. The lone score of the Tar
Heels followed a fumble by Yale of a punt behind the goal. Before leaving for the Yale game, Nemo Coleman,
the husky halfback, was chosen as captain for this season. Coleman celebrated this honor by booting a couple for over
60 yards.

West Virginia's defeat at the hands of Pittsburgh leaves little hope for the taming of the Panthers this season unless
it can be done by Georgia Tech. It was hardly expected that any team could put four touchdowns across on
the powerful Mountaineers. West Virginia endangered Pitts’ goal when they recovered a fumble but were unable to make any further
advance. The game was not as closely played as it should have been, with several costly fumbles being made on
both sides.

A big feature in deciding the Southern championship will be the Vanderbilt-Georgia Tech game next Saturday. The advance dope from
Vandy shows that they have one of the heaviest teams the South has seen in years. The line will average
200 pounds from end to end and the whole team will weigh around 185 pounds. Pecuniarily speaking, it is rumored
that Commodore money in Tennessee is mighty plentiful, which is a pretty good indication of the confidence they have in
stopping the Tornado.

N. C. State recovered somewhat from the trouncing by the Navy and walked over the inexperienced Hampton Roads team 100-0.
An interesting feature of the game was the record of six touchdowns out of seven scrimmages. The seamen outweighed the
collegians but were unable to make any headway under the superior coaching and training.

**Georgia Leads in Inter-Dormitory Basketball**

One-Sided Scores Mark All Games — Very Good Form Being Displayed

Inter-dormitory basketball began with a rush on last Tuesday when Georgia took in North Wing Chambers, 33-13. There was not
much pep manifested, and only a handful of spectators were present. This has been the case at every game played
to date, and the student body is urged to take more interest in their teams and get out and root
hard. The game was a rather listless affair, with occasional spurts of good teamwork by Georgia. Doubles and Brice, for
the winners, and Schenck and Covington, for the losers, did the best work of the afternoon.

Line-up:
- Georgia: Doubles (12) R. F., Chalmers (6) L. F., Askew (6) C., Brice (7) R. G., King L. G.
- N. W. C.: Brown, J. R. F., Covington (8) L. F., Carnelson C., Schenck (1) R. G., Brown, J.
L. G.

Substitutions: Georgia, Hyland and Roberts (2); N. W. Chambers, Elliott (4) and Bernhardt. Referee, Mr. Miles. Time of halves, 15
minutes.

On Wednesday, Rumple and South Wing Chambers played a very interesting and snappy game, South Wing beingthe victor 23-21. The
final score was not arrived at till two extra periods were played, the game being tied at the end of
the last half and at the end of the first extra period. There was not much real teamwork shown till
the last half when South Wing pulled together enough to overcome the lead of nine points which Rumple had held
up to the middle of the half. From then on it was nip and tuck for both teams, each missing
some easy shots. Hawkins ended the play by caging two free throws in the second extra period. Line-up:

Rumple.
W. C. Crawford (4)....R. F.
Ormond, A.P. (5) Craig (4)....L. F.
Hawkins (10) Mauze (5)....C.
Freeman (8) Erwin, L. (6)....R. G.
Neel Erwin, M. (2)....L. G.
McKeithen

Referee, Mr. Miles. Time of halves, 15 minutes.

Watts ran away with Louisiana on Friday to the tune of 68-14. But if the sizes of the two teams
are considered the result is not surprising, and the work of the Louisiana team was very good considering its handicap.
Roberts had his eye with him, shooting 15 field goals in the half which he played. Hall also starred for
Watts. For the Midgets, Dick and Brake played the best game. Line-up:

Watts.
Oltman (6)....R. F.
Brake (6) Hall (20)....L. F.
Dick (4) Finley (12)....C.
Fewell....R. G.
McLaurin Price....L. G.
Houghton (4)

Substitutions: Watts Roberts (30), for Fewell. Referee, Mr. Miles. Time of halves, 15 minutes.

The Georgia team added another victory to their number last Friday by winning from S. W. Chambers. Georgia seems to
be trying to go through without a defeat and so far her record is unbroken. Doubles and Brice were the
mainstays for Georgia, while McCrary was the individual star for S. W. Chambers. Line-up:

Georgia:
S. W. C.
Seno Hyland (6)....R. F.
McCrary (9) Doubles (14)....L. F.
Ormand, A.P. (2)

STANDING OF TEAMS.
Won. Lost.

Prospects for the best baseball season in the history of the college are indeed bright. Already an interesting schedule of
eighteen or twenty games, seven or eight of which will be played on the hill, is being worked up by
Manager Foscue. The season will probably open with a game on the hill with Oak Ridge Institute. Although nothing definite
has been arranged, the Red and Black machine will probably cross bats with Carolina at Winston-Salem on Easter Monday. Two
trips are being planned—one through the State and one through South Carolina and Georgia. With a number of old stellars
and no doubt several new ones from the class of '23, Coach Crayton will be able to round up a
team that will make the game interesting for any of Davidson's opponents.

THE SCRUB.
When the football season rolls around Some loyal fellow can be found Who is ready to die and do his
best That his Alma Mater may mount the crest. The season has not made much advance When he sees that
he has not a chance To make the team, the varsity, that season, But he is out fighting, fighting for
a reason. And this is the reason you all may know He's fighting that glory for his college will glow.
He knows that when the scrub team was good Just that much higher the varsity stood. Though he be battered
and torn apart Not one time does he ever lose heart And by many he is often termed a Dub
But all hail to the ever fighting scrub. —Petrel.

The golf course is now being cleaned off. Quite a number of the students have been helping during their spare
time to cut grass and bushes off the course. If this work keeps up, playing can be started in a
short time. The plans of the club will be announced later.

No man ever made much of a success as his own press agent.
