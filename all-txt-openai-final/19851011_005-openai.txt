**Former college physician closes private practice**

By NELLE McCORKLE

College Physician Emeritus Dr. James B. Woods, Jr. ’18 closed his office last week after forty-three years of practice in
Davidson. A general practitioner, Woods served as College Physician from 1942-69.

Woods grew up in China, where his father was a medical missionary. After attending boarding school in Shanghai, he came
to America to attend Davidson. Woods said that his father, a University of Virginia graduate, chose Davidson for Woods and
his three brothers because he feared that “straight from China, we might not be ready for the problems of the
University.”

In 1924, he returned to China as a medical missionary. After six months of intensive language school in Peking, Woods
began a fifteen-year term of duty at a hospital in Chin Kiang. Because he was practicing in the years before
antibiotics, Woods was forced to do many “opening-up operations and hot soaks” during his years in China. “I learned surgery
the hard way,” having done only minor operations before arriving in Chin Kiang, Woods said.

During his years as a missionary, Woods attended a tropical diseases course in London. This course prepared him for a
recent diagnosis of malaria in economics Professor Clark Ross, who contracted the disease while in West Africa. Woods recognized the
disease when many physicians limited to domestic experience could not identify it.

In 1935, Woods married Elizabeth Blain, who was then teaching French at an American school in Shanghai. Also the child
of missionaries, Mrs. Woods graduated from Randolph-Macon Women’s College, but met her future husband when she was a young girl
in China. Fifty years after their wedding in Hang Chow, the Woodses celebrated their golden anniversary here earlier this year.

The Woodses had to leave China in 1937, but they returned in 1938 despite Japanese occupation, a situation Woods describes
as “difficult but not impossible.” In 1940, the Woodses “came home on leave.” Recognizing the imminence of war, Woods chose
not to take his family back into China the following summer but in 1941 served at a hospital in Roanoke,
Virginia. He accepted then-President John Cunningham’s offer of Davidson College Physician in 1942, beginning years of “going pretty steadily seven
days a week.”

Woods’ duties included attending football and basketball practice as well as home games, and caring for ill or injured students.
In his private practice, Woods delivered babies, maintained office hours, and made house calls.

Called to serve in the Army in 1943, Woods joined a military government unit in the Philippines as its doctor.
The Army needed American doctors who spoke Chinese, Woods said, but did not call him earlier because of a rule
that not all doctors in a town be drafted. Returning to Davidson in 1944, Woods resumed his College duties and
reestablished his private practice. Of those years and subsequent ones, Woods said, “I was going pretty steadily seven days a
week. My wife was very patient.”

Of current medical technology and his insistence on careful diagnoses, Woods said, “I think all these new ideas for equipment
are wonderful. We did have a little x-ray, only used for fractures. You had to diagnose by examination, and couldn’t
use tests to confirm diagnoses.” As a long-time patient and friend, Economics professor Charles Ratliff maintains, “Some people have concluded
that Dr. Woods can walk into a sick room and smell a disease.”

During his years of private practice, Woods has delivered babies, maintained office hours, and continued to make house calls. He
has even received patients at his home: granddaughter Elizabeth Dick, a Davidson sophomore, said, “I remember stopping Parcheesi games and
clearing out of the den so a patient could come in.”

In forty-three years of practice in Davidson, Woods said, “Very few times was I called out of church.” Instead, for
“relaxation,” he sang in the Davidson College Presbyterian Church choir, and “figured anyone could wait until after church if he
needed me.”

Treating patients in the early days of Medicaid, Woods maintains that “voluminous papers” caused him to decide not to send
bills to Medicaid patients. Woods said, “I just figured the best thing to do was forget the whole thing.” He
insists, however, that this arrangement did not arise from...“just complete unselfishness,” but that it was “partly the simplest financially.” Of
Davidson, Woods said, “Everybody knows you, and you know everybody else.” His wife calls the town “a fun place to
live.” Elizabeth Dick spoke of her grandparents’ years of participation in and involvement with the College and community. Of her
grandfather, she said, “He’s always a physician — not just a nine-to-five person.” Upon arrival at Davidson in 1942, Woods
appointed an informal five-member committee to tell him when to retire. Ratliff, one member of this committee, once babysat for
the Woods children while a Davidson student. This week, Ratliff said, “Dr. Woods is one of the best diagnosticians in
the medical profession.” Of the committee, Woods said, “I told them, ‘y'all are just going to be the ones that
have to tell me,’ but none of them has told me to retire.” Woods received his M.D. from the Medical
College of Virginia in 1922, interned in Richmond, and served his residency at Bellevue Hospital in New York City.

International students express differing views
By DAVID WILLIAMS

Fifteen men and women from nine different countries have joined the Davidson Community as international students this year. Representing cultures
as diverse as France and the People’s Republic of China, each of these students brings to Davidson a unique perspective
on life in a different part of the world. By now, each international student has spent at least a month
in a new academic environment and has had a chance to compare and contrast life at Davidson with life in
his or her native land. Some have expressed surprise that American lifestyles and culture are quite different from what they
had originally expected.

“I came prepared to see a much more shocking culture,” observed Piyush Mubayi of New Delhi, India. “I think this
place is a lot more conservative.” Sunil Batra, also of New Delhi, found that “there is much more rigidity in
various aspects of American society as opposed to what I thought Americans had, especially in man-wife relationships and the educational
system.” Kerstin Malmborg of Stockholm, Sweden, commented, “I thought you were more prejudiced, but I think Davidson is an exception.
People here are more open-minded.” Similarly, Wen Shan Xie of the People’s Republic of China, said Davidson “is a very
good place. I was surprised to find the place so peaceful. Here there is a good atmosphere for study, and
everything is convenient for students.”

Other students have noted significant differences between America and their native country. Gijs Patijn of Doesburg, Holland, noted that “in
America, everything — cars and streets — is bigger and more spread out compared to Holland. Also, people here are
easier to make contact with.” Johanna Erlandson of Kungsbacka, Sweden, said: “In Europe, the countries are so small. The United
States is so big. Sweden could fit into South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia.” Having traveled halfway around the world,
the South Asian students seem to have experienced the most significant changes in environment. According to Uday Lohani of Kathmandu,
Nepal, the United States is “so far away from home. There is no way of knowing what's going on back
home.” Lohani is amazed about the lack of international awareness at Davidson. “Many Americans don’t know their own population or
the name of their own Secretary of State. [Americans] seem to be overly scared with Communist takeover outside the United
States.”

Overall, the international students seem to be enjoying their experiences in America. “The time is too short,” said Thomas Gebauer
of Marburg, West Germany. “I have had a lot of experiences so far. And I really haven't had culture-shock.” Likewise,
Patijn commented that the people he has met have been “very hospitable. That's what Americans are.” Other international students include
Sebastian Koch, Ranjit Rawley, and Deepak Talwar of New Delhi, India; Eric Lam of Hong Kong; and Florence Carmen Triguero
de Juan of Madrid, Spain.
