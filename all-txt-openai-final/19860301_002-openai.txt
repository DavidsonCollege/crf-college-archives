**THE DAVIDSONIAN**

**Shi charged with plagiarism**

History professor David Shi was arrested yesterday on charges of plagiarism, campus police said. The arrest came after a four-month
search (headed by former students) for words he copied from various other authors to use in his recent book, *The
Simple Life*. The ex-students, who wished to remain anonymous, said: “We really wanted to nail him on this one. Sure,
we're a little bit vindictive. He got us a couple of years back. Now it's our turn.”

Shi replied, “They are simply wrong. The words ‘a, and, the, but, or, and however’ do not count in cases
of plagiarism.”

“A little word here, a little there add up. We know; we’ve learned our lesson — now he has to
pay the price for his wrongdoings,” the former students added.

**Accuracy in Academia establishes Davidson chapter**

Accuracy in Academia, a Washington-based right-wing watchdog organization which monitors the political beliefs of college professors, has established a chapter
on the Davidson campus.

“We're gonna find all the pinkos at this school!” said political science professor Brian J. Shaw, Accuracy In Academia’s new
Davidson coordinator. “We've got no need for vodka-snorting, war-mongering, atheistic, fat-keistered commies at this institution!”

He explained that AIA is dedicated to removing all traces of Marxist, socialist, or liberal bias from America’s college classrooms
by “making a few lists.” He said, “We’ve already got positive proof that there are at least 300 card-carrying communists
on the Davidson faculty, and we're out to find the rest.”

Shaw said that AIA’s tactics involve placing student volunteers in campus classrooms to monitor suspect professors with tape recorders, microphones,
and “very, very, very small video cameras.”

Shaw said that Davidson AIA has already submitted a list of suggested changes in literature titles to Library Director Leland
Park. “We think the titles of some of these books should be Americanized,” he said. “We’re changing *The Red Badge
of Courage* to *The Red, White, and Blue Badge of Courage*; *Ivanhoe* to *Melvinhoe*; *The Scarlet Letter* to *The Mauve
Letter*; and *Huckleberry Finn* to *Huckleberry Swede*.”

He added, “We don’t allow any of our operatives to wear red. Except when they wear white and blue too,
of course.”

**News Summary**

**Playboy does Davidson**

By DEE-DEE BOPPER

Rumor rocked Davidson College this week as Playboy magazine interviewed candidates for its “Girls of the Southern Conference” issue Monday
and Tuesday in the Shangri-La Room. The visit was sponsored by the Careers Office. Ken Woods said, “I think this
is a groovy opportunity for our students to interface with existential realities.”

Young women in a vast array of skimpy clothing mobbed the Union in an attempt to achieve stardom. Over 47
percent of the freshmen women applied for the spot, the other 53 percent victims of the “freshman fifteen.”

Always alert, the College Security evicted two faculty members and ten Queens girls posing as Davidson co-eds. Chief Hughes said,
“We knew they did not belong, they all had such good figures and had taken time to dress fashionably and
apply make-up.”

Tuesday afternoon Hugh Hefner made a surprise appearance in the 900 Room to announce the winner of the search for
the Davidson bunny. Amidst tense silence, “Hef” introduced Chastity Belk as the Davidson winner. Ms. Belk of Boise, Idaho also
won an...All-expenses-paid trip in late February to the Las Vegas Playboy Mansion. (Belk had to decline the trip due to
a conflicting Humanities exam.) In an exclusive interview with The Davidsonian, Belk said that she posed in a black lace
teddy with a copy of Joyce’s *A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man*. Of the book, she said,
“I feel a real kinship with Stephen Daedalus, we are both on journeys to find ourselves.” When asked why she
decided to pose for Playboy, Belk responded, “I was tired of Davidson men seeing me as just another brilliant mind
and of them treating me as just one of the brains. I want them to see me as a real
woman. Last week I went to a band party hoping to dance and ended up discussing Emerson’s subversion of platonic
ideals in his essay on nature with a man from my Humanities discussion section. I didn’t even have a date
to Midwinters and I had to go to the bonfire all alone. Now I hope the men at Davidson will
see me as the simmering sexpot I am.”

Campus response to the magazine’s appearance was mixed. There were the typical cries of “degrading, sexist, pornography” from Davidson feminists.
Sharon Hunsucker, head of the Manhaters and Emaculators Committee, said, “I find the presence of Playboy disgusting. In protest of
the ‘girls of the Southern Conference’ issue, we are planning to hook our bras across Interstate-77 in a show of
our objection. We hope for a sort of boomerang effect among our sisters in other Southern Conference schools.” On the
other side, Derek Strong, chairman of the “Rate ’Em on a Scale of 1 to 10” Club, said, “I am
thrilled over this fantastic opportunity for Davidson women to gain national exposure. In fact, I am jealous. I have often
thought I would be an excellent choice for Cosmopolitan’s Bachelor of the Month.” The Cornelius 7-11 store has ordered “triple
the regular number of Playboys” in preparation for the expected demand for the issue featuring Girls of the Southern Conference.

**Mascots murdered in insipid plot**

By MASK OTT

Davidson's mascots were assassinated last night by an athletics department hitman, according to Security Chief Jackie Hughes. He termed the
incident an “execution.” Edward Jackman, a hitman by trade and part-time juggler, was charged in the deaths of the Wildcat
and the Lady Cat. Jackman was in the process of flattening the male into a rug when D.C. Security Forces,
acting on instinct, stormed the gym. Jackman, who has publicly expressed his hatred for cats, insisted on displaying the murder
weapons and bodies trophy-style to the press. Davidsonian news researchers uncovered Jackman’s history of bad mental health. As a disturbed
child, his main delight was in torturing his younger brother with bad jokes. Jackman was later institutionalized four years ago
after being caught by authorities balancing his two-year-old son on his chin. After escaping from the mental hospital, Jackman fled
to the Davidson College campus to seek asylum. Unsubstantiated rumors being spread point the finger of blame at Assistant Director
of Athletics Sterling Martin for enlisting Jackman’s services. Martin is currently being sought by the D.C. Secret Police, which is
headed by Dean of Students Will Terry. Martin is suspected to have ordered the executions over contract disputes with the
Wildcat couple.

Lady Cat beheaded. Wildcat rug.
