**THE DAVIDSONIAN**

**Kang places second in both state and regional NATS competitions**

Freshman baritone David Kang recently placed second in the state and regional NATS (National Association of Teachers of Singing) competition. NATS is an international organization with chapters in every state nationally. There are statewide and regional competitions for 20 different categories of male and female students from high school to postgraduate school.

Studio Teaching Associate Diane Thorton said NATS is “a way for voice teaching to have standardization.” Thorton continued that it promotes “sharing of ideas, both for performing and teaching.”

Kang began singing his freshman year of high school in his school choir. During high school, Kang made the All-District, All-State, and All-Regional choirs. He did not compete in NATS. Kang’s first formal voice training has been at Davidson, where he studies under Thorton. He takes one half-hour voice lesson and a one-hour master class weekly. Kang also performs in the Concert Choir and Chamber Singers. In addition to singing, Kang has played the piano for 14 years and the clarinet for five years. He played the clarinet in his high school band.

At Davidson, Kang plans to major in pre-medicine and music. He plans to be either a doctor or a college choir director. Kang has already taken Theory I and II.

Davidson students have been competing in NATS for five years, since Thorton came to Davidson. Thorton said that a small handful of students have been participating in NATS each year. She feels that it is a good way for students to test themselves because most of the competitors are music majors from large conservatory settings. The Mid-Atlantic Region, in which Kang competed, includes North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia. In the past five years, a Davidson student has made it to regional every year.

During Thorton’s first year, Garnet Smith won first place at state and third place at the regional competition. Senior Abigail Showalter won third place at the state level her freshman year and first place at the state level her sophomore year. She did not compete in the regional competition because it was too far away. Sophomore Kate Scibal went to regionals last year.

Thorton feels that the success of these students reflects the “growth that has occurred in the vocal program during the past five years”: “the level of performing has risen sharply.” When she first came to Davidson, Thorton worked part-time. Now there are two voice teachers, Thorton and Alicia Purcell.

Thorton also said that the success is “a reflection of not only the talent that is on campus but also (that) students have more opportunities to grow and to test themselves.” She thinks that “it is important to know that anybody who teaches an applied instrument on campus comes from a major conservatory and has proven himself as a performer.” Thorton had her Carnegie Hall debut this year, and she was a soloist with the Kansas City Symphony. According to her resume, Thorton “made her debut at the Lincoln Center” last year. Thorton sings with Symphony Orchestras and opera companies nationwide. Her resume...says that she “participated in two world premieres of American operas: Joseph Summer’s *Hippolytus* for the Contemporary Opera Company of America and Sam Dennison’s *Rappacini’s Daughter* with the Institute of American Music." Purcell’s biography says that she “is well-known as a consummate artist and recitalist.” Purcell has sung in Europe, at the Lincoln Center, and at the Grant Park Festival in Chicago. In addition, Purcell has been successful in opera. Purcell was a district winner in the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions three times. She received the McCracken-Warfield Young Artist Award.

To explain the approach of Davidson’s music faculty and staff, Thorton said, “when we’re studying music, to go to a class and read about it, listen to it... it is extremely important. But what creates a full picture is the performance of music. Performance of music and study need to occur to truly understand the impact of music.” Thorton also emphasized that it is “not necessary to be a music major or minor to decide to get serious about singing, etc.” In fact, most students are not majors who participate on serious levels. Non-majors even have recitals. Thorton added, “Whether music major or not, students accomplish lots of things.” To Thorton, NATS is an indication of the musical ability of Davidson students. Kang agrees, “Davidson students’ success at NATS shows the quality of the music education happening here. And the education happens not only in the classroom, but in the ensembles and studios as well. Whether in an instrumental or vocal ensemble, students work together to achieve a common goal. I think that needs to happen more often.”

K’Nesha Maddox, a senior music major and Power 98 DJ, said NATS was a “learning experience (which) helped a lot.” She feels that she improved every year. Freshman Doug Santschi also participated in NATS this year. He said it was “stressful” but an “excellent experience.” Of the opportunities at Davidson, Santschi said, “voice lessons at Davidson are a great way for me to express my creative side. They give me the opportunity to become better at an activity that I really enjoy.” As Thorton said, “we have talent on this campus.”
