THE DAVIDSONIAN, MARCH 23, 1932

Enthusiastic Alumni Meetings Held In New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore

Dr. J. W. MacConnell Gave Informative Account of the Davidson of Today. Moving Pictures Shown at Each City

NINETY ATTENDED

Fifty Were Present in New York; 23 in Philadelphia, and 17 in Baltimore. Class of 1928 Led all Others

Eighty-eight Davidson College alumni, representing 26 different classes, and two honorary alumni, last week attended three alumni meetings in New
York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore, at which Dr. J. Wilson MacConnell, of Davidson, was the honored guest and principal speaker. Reports
from officers of each chapter indicate that these were the best three meetings ever held in these cities. Elsewhere on
this page will be found the names of men who attended and officers who were elected.

Dr. MacConnell’s addresses before the three chapters are excellently described in a report received from Prof. R. C. Garth, ’19,
retiring secretary of the New York chapter, who wrote that “Dr. MacConnell presented a fine description of the college freshman
of today as he differs from the entrant of 25 years ago. Then he came in horse and buggy, now
in auto or airplane; then he was a green country boy, now he has heard the latest news or jazz
hit by radio.

“He finds when he comes to Davidson a versatile group of men as faculty. President Lingle could trim, on the
golf links, nine out of ten of the men he greets at a freshman reception; Dr. Cumming could take a
fall at ju-jitsu before he takes a fall out of a man in English; Dr. J. M. McConnell could sell
him an insurance policy, while Dr. T. W. Lingle could teach him equally as well in French, German, History, etc.

“Dr. MacConnell stressed the high standards maintained at Davidson even though it is a small institution. He mentioned that every
student gets a physical examination every year; regarded the R. O. T. C. as serving a useful purpose and was
in favor of the college taking the benefit of the government's contribution of men and materials of thousands of dollars
value.

“He told of the nature of his work in supervising the health of the students, and advocated putting a man
who needs special treatment in touch with the right specialist; preventing the spread of contagious diseases, and guiding the students
to better hygiene.

“Dr. MacConnell concluded with the thought that no matter where a man goes or what he does, he belongs to
Davidson. His interests are his Alma Mater’s also.”

At each of the three cities, two rolls of moving pictures of Davidson were shown, one depicting the inauguration of
Dr. Lingle and the other showing scenes of the Davidson campus. The New York chapter discussed the possibility of purchasing
such equipment for the alumni office, but concluded to assist in the purchase of film for the camera. Favorable reports
were received from each officer about the moving pictures, and the possibility of effective use of such means of advertising.

At all of the gatherings letters of greeting were read from Dr. C. R. Harding, their guest last year, and
Ernest Milton, alumni secretary. Other letters were read at the New York meeting from Dr. Walter L. Lingle, president of
Davidson; Dr. J. W. McConnell, former visitor there, and Prof. J. P. Williams, former member of that chapter. The Philadelphia
chapter also decided to have another meeting this spring, which will be early in May. The distribution of attendance was
New York, 50; Philadelphia, 23, and Baltimore, 17. The classes of 1928 led all others with 15 men present, followed
by 1929 with 11, and 1930 with 10.
