**Clear your conscience: save the pumpkins!**

Join the growing number of P.A.P.E. members

By MATT DAVIS

Halloween at Davidson has once again been marred by the insensitive and violent acts committed by our students and faculty.
Sure, Davidson supposedly cares. Yet, why does the smart, capable, and conscientious Davidson family continue to watch yearly atrocities take
place? Are we unaware, or do we just turn a blind eye?

Unfortunately, many of us who are aware will hide behind the ever-popular “everyone does it.” That is no excuse. We
must stand up and lead by example. We must do our best to stop the seasonal massacre and exploitation of
pumpkins!

Those of you who are degrading yourselves by laughing, ask yourselves one question: “What other members of the gourd family
have been senselessly humiliated each Halloween?” The answer is “none.”

Some of you may still defend the yearly atrocities by saying—“They are only fruit. Besides, it’s just good fun.” If
you look at it objectively, you can see exactly how sick “carving the old pumpkin” is.

First, pumpkins are removed from their family roots. Next, they are degraded by being put up for sale in some
rickety roadside stand. Then they are subjected to tortures conceived of by young children who know no bounds when handling
produce.

We then take them and cut a hole in their tops in order to remove their organs. As if these
actions are not cruel enough, we carve silly faces on them with steak knives. Last, we put candles inside them
that slowly drip hot wax and display them in public view.

What has the pumpkin done to deserve this treatment? The pumpkin’s only crime is being in the wrong place at
the wrong time.

Worse still, even the sanctity of the Davidson community is not immune to this seasonal viciousness. There is no need
to name names, for you Sickies know who you are, and you will have to live with what you have
done.

In keeping with the Davidson spirit, let us focus on a positive solution. We should band together and form a
political action committee. How about P.A.P.E. (People Against Pumpkin Exploitation)? We can march on Washington and carve squash on Halloween!

It is our duty to restore the dignity pumpkins deserve as a pretty darn tasty holiday food and stop their
senseless persecution. And if we are successful, let us not forget the years of suffering the pumpkin has endured.

I, for one, have shed many a sorrowful tear when passing pumpkin farms. We can never undo what has been
done, but we can at least end the tyranny. Adopt a pumpkin this year and show it some long-needed compassion.

**You won't find any mystery meat here**

By DAVID COARSEY

School cafeterias have always been the object of merciless attacks. Their mass-produced food just can’t compare with Grandma’s Christmas feast.

While students’ immediate reaction to the question “What do you think about the Commons?” was positive, interviewees had a few
reservations concerning originality, diversity, and healthfulness of the food.

It was generally agreed that the lunches are good, offering enough diversity to suit every taste. Most complaints concerned breakfast
and dinner.

The first things to be attacked when breakfast was mentioned were the quality of the scrambled eggs and the absence
of orange juice every other morning. With regard to breakfast as a whole, the lack of originality was brought up
on several occasions.

Overall, breakfast is a very predictable meal. Students have come to expect cereal, waffles, and eggs. The menu normally has
some French toast, pancakes, or omelets thrown in with them on alternating days. But there are never any real surprises.
It is true that there are only so many things one can do for breakfast. However, it would be nice
if there was something original every so often.

Dinner at the Commons, however, was the most criticized. Most students pointed out the lack of diversity and the health
value of the evening meals.

There is almost no diversity in the menu. Every night includes chicken and pasta of some kind. The common consensus
was that some different varieties of entrees should be served on a more regular basis, and there should be more
fresh fruits and vegetables along with a larger salad bar.

Most of the time the entrees are decent. However, there are nights where your best bet is a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich or Domino’s. There should always be some simple dish that people can eat if they are not
feeling brave enough to try some of the more exotic Commons fare.

The subject of healthy eating was also brought up. Freshman Jesse Hamner stated, “It seems like everything is deep-fried, and
there are too many starchy foods.”

Another Commons diner said he would hate to see what his cholesterol level was at that moment. It is very
difficult to find any range of low-fat foods in the Commons.

Compared to other cafeterias, however, diners agree that the Commons is quite good. Diner Geoff Bradford said, “Compared to Wofford,
the Commons is nice. The building is comfortable and a nice place to relax. The service is good, and the
food is decent.”

Despite the specific problems mentioned, Davidson's food service is very good.

It is important to realize that the Commons is not a bad place to eat. It only suffers from problems
associated with trying to serve large numbers of people, and trying to please every single one of them.

Although students offer complaints and suggestions for the Commons, they usually clean their plates.
