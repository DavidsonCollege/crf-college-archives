Okay everyone, I've been reading the
Davidsonian and have seen some

disagreement over the topic of feminism.

So I'm just going to put in my two cents.
I just don't understand why one would
be against it! I think it's great! In fact

Glow! Yikes! Feminism sure isn't what I
hoped it would be. Rebbe, I think I just made
a fool of myself in front of all my readers.

Maybe you should look at the
definition of feminist here.
