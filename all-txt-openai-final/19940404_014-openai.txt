Women's lacrosse
takes tough loss v.
Lynchburg College

By Will Cobb

Last Friday, the women’s lacrosse team made its first home appearance with students back in school. The Wildcats took on
Lynchburg College under the lights on Richardson Field. After Davidson jumped out to a 1-0 lead in the first 30
seconds of the game, Lynchburg took over and never looked back. At the end of the game, the score stood
16-4, as the Wildcats suffered their fourth loss of the season.

Liz Schaper scored her first goal of the year to start the scoring for the evening. Freshwoman Rosie Gaynor led
the offense for Davidson with two goals, and co-captain Allison Adams added another to round out the scoring for the
Wildcats.

Junior Mary Ferguson made her first career start in goal, making eight saves. Lynchburg pounded out an immense 36 shots,
with 24 of them on goal.

Davidson will have to play the rest of the year without starting midfielder Amanda Bryan, who suffered a broken finger
in a scrimmage right before spring break.

“I think right now we are missing Amanda a lot, for her leadership and talent,” said head coach Kerstin Manning.

The Wildcats face Greensboro this afternoon at 4:30 in a rescheduled match from last Tuesday on the field hockey field
beside Baker.

“We need to keep concentrating and focusing on the basics. Turnovers have really hurt us. We are starting five freshmen,
and the players haven’t had a lot of experience playing together,” said Manning.

“Overall, I am pleased right now. These girls have really worked hard,” said Manning.

After this afternoon’s game, the Wildcats will wait nine days before they face Guilford at home on April 13 at
4:30 p.m.

Davidson Duke Blue Devil

Duke continued from page 13

tucky helped bring the repeat championship in 1992. That Duke team managed to win despite the pressure of being ranked
number one all year.

I remember how I cried after Duke lost in the 1986 championship game to Louisville. Earlier that season I snuck
into Cameron Indoor Stadium for a couple of games, and even got the team to autograph a ball for me.

You see, everybody picks the teams they’re gonna like when they’re still young. I’m a San Francisco 49ers fan because
I liked their uniforms when I was ten. I’m a Braves fan because when I was little, they were always
on TV. And I’m a Duke fan because my dad took me to that game back in 1984. I guess
I’ve been lucky in picking the right teams.

The fans who declare allegiance to every other Division I basketball team have already been disappointed, including the Wildcat half
of me. Only those fans belonging to Duke and Arkansas remain.

All logic says the Razorbacks should win, but logic does not always follow. Of the teams I’ve mentioned in this
article that Duke has beaten since its Final Four run began in 1986, Temple, Georgetown, UConn and UNLV were all
favored to beat the Blue Devils. Tonight, Arkansas is the favorite.

You make the call. But my completely biased thinking says the Blue Devils will win tonight: Duke 87 Arkansas 85.
I can’t lose here. If Duke wins, I look like a genius. If Arkansas wins, I was just being a
devoted fan. And should the latter scenario take place, don’t worry. Duke will probably be back in the Final Four
again next year, and when they are, I'll pick ‘em again.
