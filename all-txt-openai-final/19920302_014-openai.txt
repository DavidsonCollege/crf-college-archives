THE DAVIDSONIAN

Beach Breaks 3 School Records, Earns All-Southern Conference

By Peter Hurtado

The Davidson women’s track and field team made a name for themselves at the Southern Conference Championships at ETSU this weekend, scoring 17 points with some heroic and gutsy performances.

Senior Kathy Beach performed at a heroic level, running to three school records and all-conference honors. Beach led most of the mile to run a 5:06.2 and place 3rd. She also placed 4th in the 3000m with a time of 10:16.5, and 4th in the 5000m at 18:19.4 for an amazing triple-school record performance.

Freshman Maria Whitehead posted a fine triple jump of 33’ 1 3/4" to place 8th overall. Maria also ran a quick 400m of 64.2.

In the mile, Davidson women ran together to record strong times, led by Carolyn Meadows (5:43.2), Jean DeMoss (5:43.2), and Lisa Sitek (5:45.1). Sitek also raced to a fine time of 11:34.7 in the 3000m.

The 4x400m and 4x800m relay squads came through with some gutsy efforts. The 4x400m squad of Whitehead (64.8), Heather Tarpley (64.2), Jennifer Humphrey (69.3), and DeMoss (69.6) crossed at 4:27.8 to place 6th overall. The 4x800m squad of Tarpley (2:41.1), Whitehead (2:40.7), Humphrey (2:43.8), and DeMoss (2:42.8) placed a strong 5th at 10:48.3.

Both Coach Gary Andrew and Coach Beth Manson were especially pleased with the strong showing by the women. The outlook for the spring is bright, and several outdoor records will surely fall.

Rugby Opens Spring Season 3-0
By Tim Harris

The Davidson club rugby team, apparently gaining significant improvement from its 1-5-1 fall season, picked up wins recently over Western Carolina, Johnson City Men’s Club, and Hampden-Sydney. Against Western Carolina, the team gained redemption for a loss to the Catamounts this fall by taking an 18-10 win. Mike Malloy, Jim Stewart, and Mike Cruise recorded tries. In the second match, played in swamp-like conditions against Johnson City Men’s Club, Davidson earned a narrow 14-12 win. Simon Priestly and Chris Ross recorded tries and Mike Malloy had two penalty kicks. Malloy’s penalty kick early in the second half was the difference in Davidson’s 3-0 victory over Hampden-Sydney last Saturday.

Wrestling Falls to Longwood, Campbell
In their last competition before the Southern Conference Tournament next weekend in Asheville, the Davidson wrestling team suffered a pair of losses in a tri-meet with Longwood and Campbell at Belk Arena. Sam Knowles captured an 11-5 decision at 158 pounds, and heavyweight Jimmy Stewart recorded a first-period pin, but the team fell 37-9 to Longwood. Scott Townsend (167 pounds) won a 12-3 decision in Davidson’s 33-18 loss to Campbell.

fast time of 8:54.4. Richardson also fought his way to a 4:27.0 mile. He ends his indoor career as the 2nd fastest 3000m runner ever from Davidson, 3rd in the 5000m, and 4th in the mile. Senior Chris Otrok also busted loose with a 15:38.1 performance in the 5000m. Otrok finishes as Davidson’s 2nd all-time fastest in the 5000m and 4th fastest in the 3000m.

Freshman Lee Sutton narrowly missed scoring, placing 7th overall in the shot put with an outstanding toss of 44’5 1/2". Sophomore Bill Ruggles leapt a fine 20’3" in the long jump to become Davidson’s 6th best long jumper ever.

Davidson was well-represented in the mile by Peter Hurtado (4:31.8), John Alsobrook (4:40.8), and Joe Beach (4:54.8).
