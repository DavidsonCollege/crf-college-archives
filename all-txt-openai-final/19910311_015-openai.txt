At the Davidson/Ridgeview Invitational this past Saturday at Richardson Field, the women’s track and field team delivered for the home fans, bringing home 3 new outdoor records and several eye-opening performances. The versatile Heather Tarpley, last season’s High Point Award winner, was responsible for all three records. Heather won the discus with a new record of 122'3". In the shot put, Heather placed 3rd with a record distance of 35'4 3/4". Also among her five events on the day was the 400m hurdles, where Heather ignited the crowd and placed 3rd with a new school record of 68.21.

In the 1500m run, Kathy Beach (4:51.38) and Karen Marshall (5:06.81) swept 3rd and 4th places for the Wildcats. These women are among the best middle-distance runners ever at Davidson, and Beach already holds the 1500m record. Erin Lee also ran a super 1500 at 5:56. 400m runners Jennifer Brown (66.66) and Jennifer Humphrey (69.41) battled their way for the Lady Wildcats. Humphrey also contributed a 31.81 performance in the 200m. She was shadowed at the line by Susan Taylor (31.87). Susan also sprinted to a time of 15.78 in the 100m dash. In the field events, Holt Hathaway placed 3rd for Davidson in the javelin (82' 5").

More excitement followed on the track, however, as Beach (2:25.38) and Marshall (2:30.49) swept 4th and 5th in the 800m run. Jean DeMoss (2:46) and Amy Bertram (2:49) are coming along quickly in their recoveries.

The men’s track and field team opened its 1991 outdoor season this past Saturday by putting on a spectacular show for the home fans at Richardson Field. In the Davidson/Ridgeview Invitational, the men placed 2nd with 153 points, nearly knocking off Wake Forest (159 points). Davidson was followed by Oglethorpe (84), Elon (83), Clarion (14), and Appalachian State (10).

The action began in the morning with the long jump. Freshmen D.J. Ruggles and Will Presson recovered after faulting on their first jumps, as D.J. let loose with a jump of 21' 11 3/4", placing 3rd. Will jumped to 4th place at 20'3". The excitement on the track oval began with the 5000m run, as three of Davidson’s top mid-distance runners chased a Wake Forest athlete for the final 2 miles to sweep 2nd through 4th place. Ian Stewart (15:38.2) got the crowd going as he and teammate Captain Ted Richardson (15:39.4) sprinted home. Senior John Moss was close behind at 15:48.23. After crossing the 2-mile point slower than target pace, all three men picked it up to collect personal bests. David Stewart followed with a second-place performance in the 110m high hurdles at 16.86. David Kerns broke away from the pack with a mile to go and went on to win the 3000m steeplechase in 9:53.95. David is now Davidson’s 4th best ever in the Steeple. Richard Wharton, in his first ever Steeple, chased his way to 5th place with a fine time of 10:44.62.

Away from Richardson Field, the Wildcat discus throwers put on a show.of their own. Steve Waters (112' 9"), Rafael Candelario (108' 5"), and Rob King (106' 0") swept 2nd through 4th place. Captain Paul Levengood turned in one of Davidson’s top performances ever in the javelin, placing 2nd at 149' 3". The weightmen continued their success in the shot put, as Rafael placed 2nd (39' 10 3/4"), Rob placed 4th (39' 2 1/4"), and John Howell, the newest Wildcat, threw 26' 10 1/2". In the triple jump, Will Presson let fly with a lengthy jump of 44' 0" to win the event. He was followed by DJ Ruggles in 4th place (40' 1 1/4").

Back on the track, Peter Hurtado moved the crowd to its feet as he sprinted by a Wake Forest runner to win the 1500m in 4:07.36. Ben Wiley turned in 4th place at 4:26.62. David Stewart kept the excitement going in the 400m, as he placed 6th in a tight race at 53.57. David was followed by William Bobo (58.27). In another tight finish to excite the fans, Wendell Robbins (5th, 11.46) and DJ Ruggles (6th, 11.90) ran strong for the Wildcats in the 100m dash. In the 800m run, Peter Hurtado (1:59.74) and Cam Dauler (2:01.14) kept the crowd excited by passing several runners to place 2nd and 3rd. Mike Grant (2:06.92) and David Kerns (2:11.68) placed 5th and 6th as the Wildcats seemed to dominate the oval races.

In a phenomenal performance, freshman sensation Duncan Spears electrified everyone at Richardson Field with his victory in the grueling 400m hurdles. Duncan’s lightning-fast time of 57.80 marks him as one of Davidson’s best ever. To finish the outstanding showing by the Wildcats, the 4x400m relay squad of Grant, Moss, Wiley, and David Stewart placed 2nd. Stewart led the way with a fine 53.7 split. Coaches Andrew and Manson were very excited about the Wildcats’ performance and predict that several records will soon fall. Thanks to all you fans who came out and participated in the excitement. The men will send squads next weekend to Clemson and to Pembroke State.
