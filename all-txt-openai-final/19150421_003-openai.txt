“What Wonderful Progress You've Made!”
Many students of music fail to realize how much a poor piano can hold them back, and what they gain
when they have a fine piano with artistic tone quality.
A GOOD PIANO MEANS EVERYTHING TO YOU
It isn’t simply accident that the Stieff is probably used in more conservatories than all other pianos. Teachers realize what
a good piano means. And now you benefit by our Direct Selling Plan.

DR. REED FILLED LOCAL PULPIT
The pulpit of the Presbyterian church was ably filled at both the morning and evening services last Sunday by Dr.
C. Reed of Columbia Seminary. At the morning hour, the subject of “Faith and What it Can Accomplish” was most
clearly and logically presented. “Lay hold on the promises of God and do not let them go until victory is
yours,” was the lesson which he left with his hearers.

F. SMITH ELECTED EDITOR-IN-CHIEF ANNUAL
At a meeting of the Junior class on last Monday morning, Frank Smith was elected the editor of Quips and
Cranks for next year. The Annual is published each year by the Senior class, and under the efficient direction of
the newly elected editor, it is anticipated that the volume which will be issued next year will be up to
the usual high standard.

Y. M. C. A.
At the Thursday night meeting of the Y. M. C. A., the fourth of the series of life work talks,
“The Ministry as a Life Work,”was ably presented by A. McIlwaine. Love for humanity, a desire to serve others, and,
above all, to be their spiritual physicians, were pointed out as the essential requisites for one who would be a
true minister of the Gospel.
