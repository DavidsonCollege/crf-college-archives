SCHOLARSHIP SOCIETY FORMED AT DAVIDSON

During Commencement week of 1915, the Mimir Society was organized by several members of the faculty and of the class
of 1915. The object of the society, according to the constitution, is the promotion of scholarship among the students of
Davidson College. From the men with the highest rank in scholarship in the Junior and Senior classes, several will be
elected at each commencement.

The rules governing election to membership are as follows:
1. The members ofThis society shall be chosen primarily from the members of the graduating class of Davidson College. Students
of the academic department who fulfill the following requirements are eligible for membership: Those who have made an average grade
for three consecutive years of at least 93 per cent; these must have done three-fourths of the work required for
a degree in resident work at Davidson College, but credit gained by examination will be counted; all non-elective work must
have been completed.

2. No man who has received a grade of less than ten points above the passing grade in any college
course, or who has failed on a term’s work in any course shall be eligible for membership.

3. The total number elected from each class shall not exceed 15 per cent of the members graduated in that
class.

4. Members shall be elected at the close of their Junior or Senior years. Although the society is a local
organization, steps are being taken to affiliate it with a strong national scholarship organization, its requirements for membership being drawn
up with that end in view.

The members of the Mimir Society in college now are: From the faculty: Prof. I. L. Nowelas, Dr. C. R.
Harding, Dr. T. W. Lingle, Dr. I. M. McConnell, Dr. W. T. Martin, and Dr. M. T. Sentelle. From the
Senior class: H. A. Campbell, S. T. Henderson, and F. M. Mitchell. The emblem of the society is a small
gold pin representing a raven perched upon a crescent, upon which is inscribed the word “Mimir.”

DR. MARTIN DELIVERS TALK TO STUDENTS

Taking as his subject “Honesty,” President Martin delivered a most helpful and profitable address to both old and new students
at the chapel hour on Monday morning, September 6th. In the course of his talk he urged all students to
be honest: first, with their parents, who were sacrificing either money or pleasure or both to send them to college;
second, with those around them—the creating of unnecessary noises being especially referred to; third, with themselves—seeing that they received as
much from their college course as they should; and fourth, with their God. The speaker emphasized particularly the duty of
all old men to do what they could to help the new men get started right.
