Why must sexual abuse persist?

By Brett Simpson

In regard to the male/female dynamic of sexual abuse, I can’t write empathetic words of wisdom. From my perspective, though, much still needs to be done to rid ourselves of it. We all know the power that “NO!” must assume in sexual situations. We know about the power struggle at the root of sexual abuse, the insidious male idea of women’s rape fantasies, women allowing themselves to slide into dangerous situations, and the permanent damage sexual abuse can leave on both attacker and victim. But for all the information we collectively know, commiserating understanding is still lacking, leading to personal catastrophes for an unlucky few.

Female victims of sexual abuse greet every new sexual relationship with emotional scars and gnawing nightmares. Male perpetrators of sexual abuse (if brought to legal justice) must endure incarceration, ruined hopes of a professional career, and—I hope—a lifelong heavy conscience. Although all of the general public has attained clear knowledge of all the possible damages, sexual abuse still occurs. This truly boggles my mind.

I can’t even come to a conclusive opinion about why it still occurs. Does genetic barbarity factor in? Does the alcohol-quickened sexual tingle overcome reason when a woman looks too appealing, or is that only a precursor to the inner-driven power struggle soon ensuing?

Where the lines are drawn, and where they fade... I can’t tell. And I’m sorry to all women for the fact that people can only logically understand the pain of sexual abuse, and that male empathy for (female-oriented) sexual abuse cannot be gained. These are permanent handicaps women must work against when educating men about sexual abuse.

I have neither answers nor advice. If only to reiterate, I'm in no position to use this article to jockey a delineated viewpoint on this matter. I guess I’m merely concluding with the rather saddening opinion that even though we have been educated and socialized against such behavior, sexual abuse remains a germane issue to everyone. All I can suggest is to keep talking, to keep voicing your views and your thoughts. Silence about the issues seems the most grave injustice of all.
