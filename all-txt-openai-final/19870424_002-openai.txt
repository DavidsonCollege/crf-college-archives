**Ground broken for new shopping center**

Crosland Erwin Associates held groundbreaking ceremonies Wednesday morning for a new shopping center in Cornelius. The complex, known as the Norman Crossing Shopping Center, will be located on Highway 73 at the I-77 interchange. According to Leasing Associate Gretchen Sheets, the shopping center will contain 49,000 square feet of retail space. Sheets said Food Lion and Kerr Drugs will be the major tenants of the center. Food Lion Inc. has not yet decided if the Davidson Food Lion will remain open once the new Cornelius store is completed late this summer.

**Services planned for Mary Lu Daggy, recently passed away**

Mary Lu Daggy, wife of retired biology professor Tom Daggy, recently passed away. The Davidson College Arboretum Advisory Committee has planned a memorial planting of flowering trees in the area between Davidson College Presbyterian Church and Eumenean Hall. The planting will occur on Saturday, May 2, 1987. Those interested in participating should contact Dr. John Williamson or send donations to the Department of Biology (checks made payable to Davidson College).

**Ex-political prisoner from Cuba to speak at Davidson**

Armando Valladares, who spent twenty-two years in a Cuban prison, is coming to Davidson. He has written a book, "Against All Hope," which recounts the physical and psychological abuse that he suffered during his imprisonment and the faith that helped him survive. He will be here at Davidson on Wednesday.

**Eating disorder support group started this term**

A campus support group for women with eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia has been organized this term by Georgia Ringle. Ringle, who holds a master's degree in public health, emphasized that the group is non-threatening and confidential. Meetings will be held Mondays at 7:15 p.m. in 301 Chambers. Although the group is currently for women only, Ringle hopes to be able to include men next fall as well. For further information, contact Georgia Ringle at 892-8748.

**Perimeter house lottery forces dormitory changes**

Because the perimeter housing lottery placed 42 women and only 18 men in perimeter housing, the Residence Life Office has made changes in the male-female division in the on-campus dorms. According to Director of Residence Life Tom Jennings, the male-female ratio in campus housing for the fall would have been 56.5% men to 43.5% women, while the ratio for all students enrolled is 60% men to 40% women. In order to correct the balance, the west wing of Duke will change from a women’s hall to a men’s hall. Jennings noted that if the change was not made, there would have been a substantially larger number of men without housing and vacancies for women.
