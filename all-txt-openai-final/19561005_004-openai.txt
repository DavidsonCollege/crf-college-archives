52 Davidson ROTC Cadets Attended Summer Camp
Fort Benning Scene of Tough 6-Week Training
By HARRY ANTRIM

For six weeks this summer, 52 Davidson ROTC cadets found themselves in the care and keeping of the U.S. Army,
while they underwent an extensive training program designed to put into practical use the theories and techniques which they had
been learning in the classroom here at the college.

Davidson College class rings will undergo a change for the first time in twenty years. A college official said that
the bidding contract was going to be awarded to a new company in order to give the students better service
and to correct several errors on the ring.

ROTC cadets from 34 colleges and universities throughout the South moved into Fort Benning’s yellow barracks the last week in
June. Before they left, on August 3, these sixteen hundred prospective second lieutenants were saying they had “found a home
in the Army.”

Davidson cadets ranked first in the graded map reading course and second in the written comprehensive test given to all
the cadets during the last week of the camp. Cadet Bill Martin was designated outstanding cadet of his company, and
a number of the other Davidson cadets finished the six-week course with outstanding records both in their individual companies and
in the entire cadet corps.

As the training program for the six weeks unfolded, it was evident that the Army spares no expense to train
the men who today make up a large portion of the officer cadre of the American military services. The cadets
undergoing this training discovered that it is a far cry from reading about tactics in a textbook to the actual
working out of problems “on the ground.”

To increase individual cadet participation and to give each cadet an opportunity to gain experience in the job of leading
men, cadet officers were named in each company and these posts were changed every day. One day might disclose a
cadet in the last rank of the last squad and the next day might find him leading an entire company.
This sort of practical training is employed here at Davidson in the cadet regiment and it is easily the most
effective method of teaching future officers the ins and outs, the do’s and don’ts, and the techniques and means of
command functions.

All phases of the Army were presented to the cadets and opportunity was given them to operate most of the
small weapons now in use by the U.S. Army. The Engineers, Signal Corps, Medical Corps, Transportation Corps, and virtually all
of the technical and administrative branches of the Army were presented to the cadets by both thorough demonstrations and practical
exercises. The effectiveness of Artillery and Armor was vividly shown in a number of demonstrations and problems which not only
served to impress upon the cadets the important function of these two combat arms, but also to reveal to them
the extensive amount of planning and coordination necessary to any effective combat operation.

The bulk of the training was directed at infantry techniques and tactics, for it is this branch which provides the
best ground for teaching men the techniques of leadership and small unit command, to say nothing of the fact that
the Infantry is the primary combat branch of the Army.

Not all was work and lighter moments were occupied by dances and recreational facilities of all types. Each company participated
in an extensive program of competitive athletics. Outstanding college athletes performing on Benning’s sandy softball field included Tennessee tailback John
“Drum” Majors, Mississippi State's Billy Kinard, now with the Cleveland Browns, and North Carolina State’s flashy Al D'Angelo.

All of the many hours of demonstration, classes, and practical exercise were culminated by a three-day field maneuver in which
the entire cadet corps operated as a tactical unit in the field. For three days and three nights, the cadets
came as close to living the life of a soldier in combat as is possible to approximate in a peacetime
situation.

CLEAN CUBICLES were a necessity as the famed SMI’s (Saturday morning inspections) soon proved. Charlie Gribble (standing) and Boyce Martin
put on the finishing touches.

Selby to Explain Foreign Service

Mr. Richard Roy Selby, Jr., a representative of the United States Department of State, Washington, D.C., will visit Davidson College
on October 12th to present to interested students information on career opportunities in the United States Foreign Service Officer selection
process. There will be two open sessions, one at 11:00 a.m., and one at 3:00 p.m., on October 12 in
the Union Ballroom. Question and answer periods will follow each session and personal interviews can be arranged with Mr. Selby.

The Department of State has announced that a written examination for the Foreign Service will be held on December 8,
1956. Candidates must be age 20 and under 31 and a United States citizen for nine years. Applications for the
one-day written examination must be received by the Board of Examiners in Washington, D.C., before midnight October 26, 1956.

The committee studying the proposal for the new ring is hoping to reach a decision by the middle of this
month. If this is the case, orders on the ring will be accepted around the middle of January. Delivery should
take from six to eight weeks.

Psychology Staff To Lead Discussion on Television Program

There will be a showing in the College Union October 12 at 9:30 p.m. of the dramatization of the trial
of a man practicing psychology while accused of the fraud that he was not licensed nor qualified for the practice
of either psychology or psychiatry. This case was brought to light by Mrs. Valerie Nicholson, an Associated Press correspondent in
Southern Pines. Because of many confidences between the accused and his clients, evidence had been extremely difficult to produce until
the entrance of Miss Nicholson into the affair.on September 28, the television program was rescheduled to the later time upon
instigation presumably of the sponsors in that the showing at this time might throw an aura of pre-determined guilt upon
the accused. The program “Nightmare,” stars Sara Seegar as Valerie Nicholson and is intended to show the methods of newspaper
correspondents in the bringing to light of supposedly unlawful or unethical practices in the fields of services vital to the
mental and physical health of the public. Following the television showing, Drs. Workman, Bevan, and MacBrayer will lead an authoritative
discussion upon the topic which is to be open to all interested. This is sponsored by the Union Round Table
committee headed by Leon Howell. This discussion will be in an informal vein accompanied with the serving of coffee.

Sent to Colleges

The Davidsonian, realizing that politics is a chief issue on college campuses at the present time, has mailed letters to
virtually every college newspaper in the tri-state area of North and South Carolina and Virginia. The letter proposes a poll
of the students in the various colleges on the presidential election in November. Collectively, some 75,000 students can express their
views and preferences through this medium. The results of the poll to be published in The Davidsonian, and the other
papers contacted during the week prior to the election will be surveyed by students throughout the area. Actually, the purpose
of this poll is two-fold. Through the cooperation of the editors of the various college newspapers, a permanent relationship can
be established linking college newspapers in this section into a type of intercollegiate press association. If the poll is conducted
in the manner prescribed, all students in the tri-state area will be contacted, resulting in an authoritative forecast of just
how college students in the South will vote.

Masquers Present Play, ‘The Rainmaker’

The Red and Black Masquers, the college dramatic group, announced today the cast for the staging of “The Rainmaker”, November
16 and 17 in Chambers Auditorium. The cast includes Harry Paschall as Pop Currie, Ray Atkinson as Noah Currie, Jack
Lohman as Jim Currie, and Carol Sherill as Lizzie, the only female member of the cast. Starbuck, a con man
posing as a Rainmaker, comes into the play in the person of Bill Pfefferkorn. Other members of the cast are
Stuart Fountain, the Sheriff; and George Kemmerer as File.

Coffee, Talk, Pool (Continued from Front Page)

guys that write those mystery novels just don't seem to put any good sexy parts in their stuff. I don’t
believe I've been able to mark a single one I've ever bought. Of course, this ‘Crime and Punishment’ might be
different, but to tell you the truth I'm kind of doubtful. The guys that write those things just don’t seem
to be on the ball.”

“Yeah,” said the owner, “I see your point.”

POOL SHARKS

Pool, like Intellectual Conversation, is another Union sport.

“Gee,” said the freshman, “this looks like a lot of fun... do you think you could show me how?”

“Delighted,” said the sophomore who owed Grier Martin quite a bit. “Care to make a little wager?”

“Oh, I guess so,” the freshman sighed, “I suppose I can sacrifice something to learn the game.”

Well, to cut the story short this particular freshman happened to be some kind of Billiards Champ and now the
sophomore owes Grier Martin the same load and one just a little lighter to the freshman.

Well, by this time it was getting late so I started back upstairs and at the door I met the
stud-runner I came in with.

STUD-RUNNER GOOFS

He was strolling out with his hands in his pockets, just taking it easy.

“Well,” I said, “did you get everything back to the dorm?”

“No,” he said, “It happened like this. I got the ice cream and hot dogs but I couldn't get Charlie's
cherry coke.”

“Bill,” I said.

“Oh, yeah, Bill... well, anyway I figured he wouldn’t want the ice-cream and hot dogs without the cherry coke so
I didn’t.”

“Didn't what?”

“I didn't take him anything,” the freshman said, “I just stayed over here and read magazines.”

“Oh,” I said, and then went back to the dorm and went to sleep. At that point there wasn’t much
I could do for him.

IF I HAD A MILLION!

“Life,” he cried, “is so unfair
I should have been a millionaire!
I’d drive a car, a white Jaguar
with leopard trim and built-in bar,
Complete with blondes and red heads too,
A movie queen or two would do...
I’d make a perfect millionaire!”

“Instead,” he sobbed, “at twenty-five
I’ll have to work to stay alive!”

If you are $899,999.00 short of being a millionaire but you like your pleasure big, enjoy the big full flavor,
the big satisfaction of a Chesterfield. Packed more smoothly by AccuRay, it’s the smoothest tasting smoke today!

IV’S FOR REAL! by Chester Field

Of course. Most everyone does—often. Because a few moments over ice-cold Coca-Cola refresh you so. It’s sparkling with natural goodness,
pure and wholesome—and naturally friendly to your figure. Feel like having a Coke?
