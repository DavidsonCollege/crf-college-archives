The DAVIDSONIAN, May 17, 1916

* * * AWARD OF LETTERS. *

The following have been recommended by Coach Fetzer and passed upon by the “Wearers of the D” for baseball monograms.
Before the letters are awarded, they will have to be passed on by the Executive Committee of the Athletic Association:

E. L. Alford, A. P. Saunders, L. M. Johnson, J. M. Black, A. C. Wood, W. L. Younger, Z. V.
McMillan, B. M. Brown, F. Hengeveld, W. D. Lawson. Manager R. G. Finley will be awarded the monogram with a
bar below it.

The following have been recommended for the “D” in track. For winning a first place in a dual meet: G.
S. Crouch, H. M. Grey, L. C. Brand, R. Perry, W. L. Younger, D. G. Worth. For getting five points
in a dual meet: W. G. Morrison.

On referring to the records, it was found that the record published in the Hand Book was incorrect and that
on Field Day last year Van Devanter put the shot 39 feet 2 inches, so the record was not broken
this year.

Article VI, Section 2 of the Constitution of the Athletic Association: “Any person breaking or tying a track record of
Davidson, at a properly arranged ‘meet,’ or any person winning five (5) points in an intercollegiate ‘meet’ shall be given
the privilege of wearing the letter ‘D' of Old English type, crossed by an arrow, if in the opinion of
the ‘Wearers of the D’ and the Executive Committee and captain of said team, such person deserves this privilege.”

A resolution was passed at the last meeting of the “Wearers of the D” to have the Executive Committee consider
making several changes in this rule. It was also recommended that a suitable low limit be fixed for the two-mile
before the record for this event be given to anyone. The new records made by Brand for the mile and
by Grey for the discus were verified and will be substituted for the old records.

* * * DIPLOMAS FROM SOCIETIES.

The following men will receive diplomas from the literary societies at commencement:

From the Frumenean Society: L. G. Edgerton, G. B. Hoyt, L. A. Mullen, F. H. Smith, L. G. Patton, J.

N. P. Farrior, J. D. McLeod, H. W. Ormand, W. T. Witt.

PHI SOCIETY HOLDS INSTALLATION MEETING

At a called meeting of the Phi Society Monday morning, the officers for the first term of the next year
were installed. They are as follows: S. T. Henderson, president; W. C. Cumming, vice-president; R. H. Ratchford, first critic; C.
F. Monroe, second critic; W. T. Dunlap, first supervisor; W. C. Neel, second supervisor.

The president-elect was escorted to the chair by the retiring vice-president, and in a few well-chosen words, he thanked the
members for the honor they had bestowed upon him, and asked for their support in making next year a successful
one in the work of the society.

MOVING PICTURES GIVEN BY THE SENIORS

Last night there was shown in Shearer Hall the motion picture “The Life of Shakespeare.” The picture depicts the life
of this famous writer as far as records of the events in it are available from various historical or traditional
sources. Considerable interest is attached to the picture because of the fact that the scenes for the film were laid
in the country in which he lived and worked and which is familiar to students through descriptions and pictures. The
presentation of the picture was under the management of the Senior class, which is using this means to defray the
expense of the Shakespearean pageant which is to be given at commence-The film was enjoyed by quite a number of
the townspeople and students. The same picture was shown at the Broadway Theater in Charlotte last Monday under the auspices
of the Seniors, and was a splendid success. The success of the picture was much increased by the co-operation of
the members of the Davidson Glee Club, who rendered appropriate songs after each performance Monday night.

THE MILITARY CAMP AT FORT OGLETHORPE

The Military Camp at Fort Oglethorpe, Ga., for students will begin on July 5th and last until August 8th. The
total expense for students, exclusive of uniform, is $22.50. The uniform is quite simple and consists of such things that
the student can use afterwards on hunting and fishing trips. Dr. J. W. McConnell has on hand the necessary enrollment
blanks and will be glad to fill these out for any student expecting to attend and will make the physical
examination necessary. It is also wise to be vaccinated previous to going to any summer camp and he will be
glad to do this free of charge.

A prominent manufacturer in Charlotte has offered to pay the expenses of one Davidson student to this camp and a
member of the Davidson faculty has done likewise. It is hoped that there will be others of the alumni and
friends who will make similar provisions for those of the students who need the help. The indications are that there
will be a large number of students from Davidson and other colleges of the South at this camp and it
will be an excellent outing, as well as of great value, from a physical and mental standpoint to anyone attending.
