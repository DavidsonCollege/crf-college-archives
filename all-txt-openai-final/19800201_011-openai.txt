**Job market good despite economy (CPS)**

Despite economists’ fear of a deep and long-lasting recession, the 1980 college graduate stands a one to two percent better chance of landing a job than 1979 grads, according to a new Michigan State University survey of large employers. Students with bachelor's degrees are going to be more actively recruited than those with master's and doctoral degrees, the survey also found.

“We hear a lot of talk about a recession,” comments MSU Placement Director John Shingleton, “but college grads are in good shape for two reasons. First, grads are being hired by companies for the long run. We're not talking about positions that will go up and down. Second, if there are going to be cutbacks (in personnel during an economic slowdown), they're going to be in the blue-collar ranks.”

Shingleton’s study was a survey of 471 employers across the country. The results convinced him that the heaviest recruiting will be in accounting, aerospace, electronics, retailing, the military, and by the petroleum industry. Most employers, though, said they were more interested in recruiting students with bachelor's degrees than those with associate, master's, or doctoral degrees.

Shingleton also discovered beginning salaries will be up seven to eight percent over last year. Thirty-four percent of the employers surveyed said starting salaries they offer are negotiated during the hiring process, while the remaining two-thirds of the employers set salary levels before applicants walk through the door.

**Women’s Sports** (Continued from page 2)

ably do well in a sport which is relatively new to the South and which emphasizes mental skill and teamwork. Developing the women’s athletic program is particularly important in view of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 which guarantees equal opportunities for women in higher education, said Associate Dean of Students Sue Ross, Title IX coordinator for Davidson.

According to The Chronicle of Higher Education, a recent HEW policy for implementing Title IX “requires colleges to award scholarships to men and women in proportion to their representation in the athletic program.” Since Davidson awards basketball scholarships to men, Ross said, there would also have to be scholarships for women athletes if the new HEW policy is strictly enforced. But most women do not want an athletic scholarship program.

“Personally, I would rather see the school work on providing a diversity of experiences for women rather than channeling all their money into a few scholarships,” Iles said. However, if Davidson does not establish a “long-range plan” for women’s athletics, Ross said the HEW policies may be enforced. She suggested that Davidson “voluntarily attempt to reach (the College's own) goals. In the spirit of the Honor Code, we have a responsibility to meet these goals.”

Ross said she thought the best way to develop the women’s athletic program was through student initiative, citing the recent formation of a (Continued from page 1) for about 175 juniors and sophomores should live off-campus next year. “If there are that many we should have no problems with on-campus overcrowding,” he said.

There will be more upperclassmen triples in some of the larger basement rooms in dorms and in Carnegie House, Bolding said. He added that annual increases in housing fees will make economical triples more attractive to students.

Bolding said all dormitory lounges, except for those in Duke, will be open next year. Freshmen men will live in Belk again next year, while freshman women will remain in Richardson. All other dorms, as well as basement Sentelle and fourth floor Belk, will house upperclassmen. Bolding said he plans to replace the House Manager in upperclass dorms with resident advisors. Two resident advisors willHere is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

These accepted by the EPC but had not been implemented.

First, the committee recommended that the Registrar and Vice President for Academic Affairs have a greater role in selecting course offerings. Klein said there is inadequate communication between the departments in course selection.

Also, the committee recommended that class times be more equally distributed throughout the day, as opposed to the present dominance of nine and eleven o'clock classes.

Computers (Continued from page 5)

These are just a few examples; there are many more. It does not take a wealth of experience in computer science to operate programs like this. But it does take a computer more powerful than what we have now and a group of enthusiastic people involved in it. But failure to realize the practical value of a computer is not the only problem with our attitude. Another problem is that some of us are still intimidated by computers. This is an unjustified fear, and we need to realize that computers are not going to depersonalize Davidson. Computer science is growing faster than any other area of modern development, and if we are to keep up with what is going on in the real world each of us must overcome our prejudices against technology and learn to use it to our advantage. Practice with computers should therefore be an integral part of a good liberal arts education. Every day that goes by here without a decent computer causes each one of us to miss out on an exciting and valuable part of our education. And it will not be long before familiarity with a computer will be necessary for all of us; it already is for many. The computer planning committee needs to make a decision soon. There are many things to consider, however, and the decision will not be an easy one. Each of us can take immediate action towards speeding this decision by supporting the members of the committee and expressing our concern that something be done in the near future. Hopefully, through a change in attitude towards computing and a desire to learn about this magnificent tool, Davidson can begin to offer experience in what is undoubtedly the most valuable development of our age.
