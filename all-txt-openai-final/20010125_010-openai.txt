_Davidson 68, MANHATTAN COLLEGE 65._ A lot of heart and the tandem of junior guard Janna Magette of Birmingham, Ala.,
who scored a game-high 23 points, and freshman center Meghan Bryant of Huntersville, N.C., led Davidson to a 68-65 come-from-behind
victory over Manhattan College in the opening round of the Marriott Big Apple Classic in Riverdale, N.Y., December 28.

_Drexel 82, Davidson 73._ The Davidson women’s basketball team dug itself into an early hole it couldn’t climb out of
as Drexel scored an 82-73 victory to capture the 2000 Marriott Big Apple Classic Championship at Draddy Gymnasium (Riverdale, N.Y.)
December 29. Davidson had a trio of players score in double digits, led by freshman guard Ashley Hallsted of San
Mateo, Calif., who scored 25 points.

_WESTERN CAROLINA 83, Davidson 74._ Janna Magette scored 26 points to lead a trio of players in double figures, but
it was not enough as Davidson fell to Western Carolina 83-74 January 2 in the Wildcats' first Southern Conference game
of the season. In addition to the 26 points by Magette, Davidson got 12 points from senior forward Kim Taylor
and freshman forward Robyn Flewelling of Okemos, Mich., contributed 10 points.

_UNC Greensboro 81, Davidson 42._ The Davidson Wildcats suffered an 81-42 loss to UNC Greensboro January 6 at Fleming Gymnasium.

_Furman 81, Davidson 53._ The Davidson College fell to Furman January 9 by a score of 81-53. Kena Hodges scored
quick points sandwiched around a Torrie Scott jumper as Furman took an early lead and never looked back. Senior Kim
Taylor scored the first Wildcat points. Junior forward Kelly Copland of Alamo, Calif., converted one of two free throws to
reduce the lead to three points, 6-3, with 17:31 in the first half. However, that was the closest Davidson would
get for the rest of the game.

_Davidson 71, APPALACHIAN STATE 63._ Davidson used a 15-0 run midway through the second half to capture a 71-63 victory
over Appalachian State January 13 in front of a home crowd. Freshman Meghan Bryant scored 15 of her game-high 17
points in the second half to help Davidson earn its first victory.

_Despite loss, hope persists for Wildcats_

By Mike Anderson
Staff Writer

Saturday’s showdown against conference powerhouse Chattanooga had all the makings of a natural disaster for the women’s basketball team. The
Lady Mocs entered Belk Arena with a daunting 7-0 mark, having beaten Southern Conference opponents by an average of 21
points per game. The Wildcats—still enduring growing pains over the early course of this rebuilding season—had dropped six of seven
SoCon match-ups by an average of 16 points.

Yet the Wildcats refused to go down without a fight Saturday.

“I wrote on the board that today’s game was more about getting respect than giving it,” said head coach John
Filar. “Today was a matter of getting some respect, of winning some pride back.”

Sure enough, Filar’s goal was accomplished. Davidson finished the game strongly, getting outscored by only five points in the second
half en route to a 78-60 loss. Chattanooga, for perspective, knocked off the conference’s second-best team, UNC Greensboro, by 16
on January 13.

Three different Wildcats led the way with 14 points apiece: Janna Magette, Kim Taylor, and Kelly Copland. Copland and Taylor
also combined for 17 rebounds, leading the Wildcats in a dominating effort on the boards (41 rebounds compared to Chattanooga’s
30).

“That (rebounding) is an exciting stat for us,” Filar said.

“People hit the boards big time,” said Copland. “ThereThere were times when you’d see three white jerseys fighting for the
same rebound.” Ashley Hallsted’s three-pointer at the 14:49 mark cut the Mocs’ lead to five, but Davidson never got any
closer. “Chattanooga is one of the most talented teams—if not the most talented team—to ever play in the Southern Conference,”
Filar said. Though conference player of the year Damita Bullock had a quiet night, Chattanooga freshman Miranda Warfield lit up
the scoreboard with 22 points in just 26 minutes of action. “It hurts to lose,” says Copland. “But if we
can run with Chattanooga, we know we can run with anybody.” That type of confidence will be just what this
team needs as the second round of conference action nears.

Slow out of the gate during the first half of this transitional season, Davidson captured just one victory (over winless
Appalachian State) in the first go-round—a stretch that included six double-digit losses including a 39-point debacle at UNCG. The Wildcats
struggled in a wide array of statistical categories, ranking last or second-to-last in scoring offense (64.4 ppg), field-goal percentage (39.9%),
three-point percentage (29.8%), rebounding (-over ratio (0.56). But hope dies hard for a squad with such a promising cast of
characters. Janna Magette remains one of the most potent offensive threats in the Southern Conference. Four different post players—Taylor, Jess
Heath, Courtney Laird, and Meghan Bryant—have shown promise in the paint.

UNCG Georgia Southern guard Ashley Hallsted has responded with poise and success since assuming the reins of the Wildcat squad.
Copland has come on strong with a spectacular season. And freshman Robyn Flewelling promises to contribute significantly at any of
three positions as the season continues. “We need to play every game from here on out with the effort and
intensity that we showed today,” said coach Filar. “We need to do that and we need to make our shots.
Our defense has improved 100% since two or three weeks ago even.”

The Wildcats return to action on Saturday when they travel to East Tennessee State. The Lady Bucs defeated Davidson 80-69
on December 6 at Belk Arena. Filar hopes that the first round of conference action afforded his youthful team with
a taste and familiarity of Division-I basketball. “We often forget as a staff that for 50 percent of our team,
this is the first time seeing opponents in the Southern Conference,” he said. Added Magette: “We’re gonna be a lot
more experienced this go-round.”
