Tied With Ten Minutes Left, ‘Cats Can't Hold On

the referee. The conversation led to a technical foul for Alpert, and Charlton Young made one of the two free throws. Dexter Abrams nailed a three-pointer on the ensuing possession to give Georgia Southern a commanding 72-61 advantage. Young was the chief beneficiary of Davidson fouls from that point, finishing the afternoon 10 of 12 from the free-throw line.

Zimmerman led Davidson with 14 points, while Janko Narat and Detlef Musch added 13. Young was the ‘Cats’ main thorn Saturday, notching 23 points; Calvin Sinkfield scored 20, and Abrams had 18.

Davidson capitalized on 64% of its attempts from the floor at Western Carolina in earning a 12-point victory in the teams’ first meeting. At home on Jan. 31, Davidson shot 68.1% (32-47) in trouncing the Catamounts, 82-63. With the victory, Davidson finished its six-game homestand against Southern Conference opponents with five wins.

Narat led all scorers with 21 points, followed by Zimmerman with 17 and Musch with 14. The ‘Cats only trailed once, early in the contest, and outrebounded Western by a 46-28 count.

“I was a little concerned about how we would play today,” head coach Bob McKillop said after his club fell, 80-73, to conference leader UT-Chattanooga the previous afternoon. “We came out a little lethargic but responded like mature veterans in the second half.”

After taking a 34-28 advantage into the locker room at halftime, the ‘Cats returned to ensure that Western would not pick up its first conference win of the season. Up by six, 49-43, with 14:15 remaining, the ‘Cats pounded out a 13-0 run in the next three minutes. Narat began the onslaught by making a 14-foot jumper on which he was fouled and hitting the free throw. Zimmerman nailed a three-pointer and a 12-footer down the stretch.

Davidson returns to action Wednesday at Belk Arena against county rival UNC Charlotte at 7:30 p.m.; on Saturday, Furman visits Davidson at 3:00 p.m.
