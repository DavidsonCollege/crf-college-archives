Lick Wounds, Test P. C. Tomorrow

By MIKE MOOTY
Davidsonian Sports Writer

The Wildcats of Davidson put their 1-1 record on the line this weekend as they journey to Clinton, South Carolina
to face the Blue Hose of Presbyterian College. PC has won two of their first three outings, thrashing Frederick 47-17
in their opener and coming back to snatch one from Lenoir Rhyne 21-10 the next week. Last Saturday, however, Presbyterian
fared no better than the Davidson gridders, emerging a 22-9 loser in a battle with Wofford.

Hot Night, Cold Play Cause Gridders’ Fall

A hot sticky night and an offense that could not get started led to Davidson’s downfall, as the Wildcats were
defeated 28-0 by the Citadel last Saturday.

Playing in Charleston in conditions which caused tackle Bruce Dalton and end Phil Hightower to suffer heat exhaustion, the ’Cats
fumbled on their own 22 during the second minutes of play, and the Citadel scored two plays later, as Cadet
halfback Jim Parker carried for the first of his two touchdowns.

Another touchdown in the second quarter on a ninety-yard drive gave the Citadel a 14-0 lead at halftime. After a
scoreless third quarter, the Cadets scored twice in the last period on an eight-yard run by Parker and a ten-yard
pass to halfback Francis Grant.

Coach Bill Dole was not disappointed with the Wildcats, but commented, “The Citadel was just too tough for us. They
played three units to our two, and the inability to generate a consistent offense forced our defensive team to have
to play most of the game. By the fourth quarter, the unfamiliar humidity wore them down, and so the Citadel
pushed over those last two touchdowns.”

Asked about individual standouts, Coach Dole replied, “Coaches Shoe and Thrift and I talked about this and we don’t believe
anyone played a really good game of football. Steve (Heckard) had an awful rush on him, and he didn’t have
a chance to do very well. He had a few passes dropped, and also overthrew several himself. We didn’t suffer
any injuries last week; generally, they just outmanned us and that’s the story.”

PC is a well-balanced squad, with 21 lettermen from last year. If the Blue Hose runs true to form, it
will present the ‘Cats a well-combined multiple offense. Running from a Wing-T, Slot-I, or any number of sets, PC presents
a varied ground attack. The arm of Leighton Grantham, Presbyterian’s fine field general, has been a deadly weapon in PC's
previous outings. However, he is a doubtful starter Saturday, because of a broken finger. Jim Bankhead, Grantham's favorite target for
the long bomb, is described as “a good end, big and fast, with good downfield moves.”

Having scouted the Blue Hose once this year, Coach Tom Stevens reports that PC, although not especially big, seems to
be strong overall; displaying exceptional speed and hustle. “They're sharp,” Stevens remarked. “Presbyterian always gives us a good game.”

“PC considers us number one,” added Coach Bill Dole. “They would rather beat us than anybody. It’s gonna be a
real tough game.”

The Davidson - Presbyterian series was initiated in 1919. In 1926 the rivalry was so intense that a riot occurred
following the game. As a result, the series was discontinued, and the two teams did not meet again until 1946.

Lees-McRae played host to the Wildkittens in their season opener and ended up with a fourth-quarter win last Saturday night
at Banner Elk. Lees-McRae began the scoring with a six-yard pass to end Gary Vic. After the extra point attempt
failed, the Kittens took the ball and marched down the field. Billy Taylor, 180 lb. halfback-quarterback, tallied with a two-yard
plunge and Pete Glidewell booted the PAT. The Junior College Boys added another touchdown pass and an extra point to
make the halftime score 13-7.

Davidson came back strong in the third quarter and Taylor scored again on a 3-yard run after another ground-gaining series.
Glidewell again added the PAT and the Kittens went into a disastrous fourth quarter with a one-point margin. Field conditions,
lack of manpower, and a number of penalties...

In all, Davidson has won eleven of the contests ending in a deadlock. Last October the two teams battled to
a 14-14 tie on Richardson Field in one of the finest efforts of last year's Wildcat squad.

According to figures recently released by Dr. Tom Scott, this year’s freshmen were inferior to last year's freshmen on their
physical education tests.

The test, consisting of seven basic skills, has its own point scale with the overall average being 319.8 points. The
average score of the Class of '68 is 312.8 points; whereas that of the Class of ‘67 is 346.5 points.
However, the failure percentage of each class is about the same, 27% of this year’s freshmen flunking and 25% of
last year’s.

The Class of ’68 did have the total point leader in Tommy Caldwell who amassed 569 points over Dick Byrd’s
558.4 points last year. Junior Dick Snyder holds the all-time record of 633.8 points.

Poll Points Out Lack Of Athletic Facilities

By STEVE BROWNJudging from the percentage tabulation of a poll taken among Davidson students by the Student Council in May
of 1964, one could say that the average student body member is at least an occasional participant in a sport,
and as an amateur is concerned over the apparently lacking athletic facilities of the college.

The poll, which evoked a relatively poor response (only 204 answers from a student body of approximately 1000), offered Davidsonians
the chance to express their interest and degree of activity in three sports: handball, tennis, and basketball. In addition, space
was reserved for comments concerning weight room facilities and for general opinions relating to the college sports program.

Tennis proved to be the most popular diversion of the three choices; 162 of the 204 respondents (79.5%) at least
occasionally wield a racket. Of the 162, 35 play “seldom” (three or four times a year), 56 indicated participation “occasionally”
(one or two times a month), and 70 stated that they engaged in tennis “often” (once or twice a week).
Approximately 57.5% of those questioned consider tennis facilities inadequate and suggest, on average, that four additional courts be added. Of
the tennis advocates, 110 indicated that they would play tennis at least once or twice monthly during the winter if
several all-weather courts were installed.

Basketball seized a close second place in the popularity rating: 153 persons (75%) revealed participation in the sport. Of these,
28 visit the hardwood “seldom,” 58 play ball “occasionally,” and 64 participate “often.” The consensus (by a 69% tabulation) is
that basketball facilities for the average Davidson man are inadequate. The average of the replies indicates that students would like
four more goals to be added.

Handball players, totaling 129 out of the 204 number (63.5%), are divided almost equally among “seldom,” “occasional,” and “frequent” players.
Virtually all (93%) of the respondents suggest, on average, that 3 additional courts be constructed.

Approximately 32.4% of Davidson students, basing a percentage on the questionnaire replies, utilize the weight room. Comments from the poll
sheets overwhelmingly cited a lack of adequate equipment in this department as a prime fault.

Criticisms of the Davidson athletic program were many and varied. One respondent stated that “the gym should be open more
than it is,” and suggested that student help could be cheaply hired to supplement the college-paid attendants. Other students suggested
that more attention be paid to less-emphasized sports, such as golf and swimming.

In summary, this writer believes that the general feeling expressed in the questionnaires is this: the average Davidsonian does have
an interest in sports activity. However, the student wishes to “work out” at his convenience, and thus would like the
gym to be open often and would like more and better facilities for individual sports.

Fourth Quarter Spurt Ruins Frosh Debut

Penalties all took their toll on Davidson. The Kittens lost control of the ball after several penalties and Lees-McRae scored
on a bootleg pass play after a long punt return. In the final minutes of the game, Lees-McRae scored on
a 10-yard dash and added the PAT to end the game 26-14.

Coach Tom Stevens, in commenting on the game, said that the boys played good ball until the last few minutes.
“Then the boys began to tire out and we didn’t have enough subs to rest anybody. Also, unnecessary penalties hurt
our field position.” Coach Stevens singled out Billy Taylor as doing “a fine job of running” and also commented on
the fine work of guard George Solley, the defensive play of Johnny Giles, and the effective job done by quarterback
Chip Scharfswerdt.

The Wildkittens meet Hargrave Military Academy here Saturday in what should be a tough game. “Although Hargrave is a prep
school, they have a big team with several outstanding boys from this area and will bring about 40 players with
them,” Coach Stevens said. In commenting on the strategy for this next encounter, Coach Stevens said he will try to
play more boys this week in order to give the regulars a little more rest.

Tennis Tryouts
Tryouts for the varsity and freshman tennis squads begin at 2, Monday afternoon, according to Coach Harry Fogleman. Five lettermen
return from last year’s squad, which posted a 17-6 record and finished second in the conference tournament. Top returnees are
Bill Schutt, Dick Hurd, Bill Council, Jeff Frank, and Dave Meschan. Top sophomores vying for the eight to ten places
on this year’s team are Peter Parrot, Esmond Phelps, Gordy Mueller, Jim Davis, and John Hurst.

Stretch Streak To Two
By SAM BOYTE

Team effort carried the Davidson varsity cross country team to a 26-32 victory over Wake Forest Tuesday afternoon, producing six
of the first nine finishers. “I’m real proud of this win,” said Coach Heath Whittle. “Wake Forest finished second in
the Atlantic Coast Conference last year.” Tying for first place were Paul Snell and Dick Vieham, who led the Baptists
with equal times of 22:29.5 over the 4.9-mile course in Winston Salem. Two sophomores, Robert Dean and Jesse Sims, led
the Wildcats as they captured the third and fourth positions. Finishing fifth and sixth, respectively, were Tom Heffner and John
Barrow. Eighth position was taken by Andy Little. The pattern of the race resembled that of the victory over Clemson
last week. A strong team effort by the Wildcats compensated for really excellent times by the lead runners of the
Deacons. The Wildcats’ first four finishers placed within an interval of fifteen seconds in the Wake Forest meet, showing the
balance of this year’s thinclads.

The freshmen did not fare so well, however, losing to the Deacons 48-15. John Hunter turned the course in the
best time for the first-year squad to earn sixth place. Coach Whittle rated the Wake Forest frosh, “a real good
team.” He feels that despite this loss the Kittens will improve in later meets. The varsity defends its 2-0 season
mark Saturday against The Citadel. Whittle is “not expecting too much trouble” from the militia. Adding to the confidence of
the Wildcats are two consistent performances by Dean and the improvement shown by Sims. The fact that the meet will
be run over Davidson’s home course will be another factor in the Wildcat harriers’ favor.
