(Editor's Note: This is the first of a series of articles by Professor Griffin on “The Inflation Problem in the United States.”)

It is quite possible for us to imagine that, as soon as mobilization of men and materials for war begins, the government should transform our country into a thorough-going police state, with effective sanctions for a universal draft, price and wage controls, rationing, production quotas, allocations of productive resources, etc. It is also possible to imagine the continuation of these controls, assuming the shooting phase of the war is won, during the postwar conversion period. If such a plan should be adopted, and if it is accompanied by fiscal policies resulting in a balanced budget, regulations might be subsequently relaxed, making for explosive inflation.

The fact of the matter is, of course, that we do not adopt such a system. In World War II we made significant moves in the direction of the totalitarian police state, but at all times significant amounts of freedom were retained. Many men were drafted, willy-nilly, but were remunerated in terms which perhaps compared favorably with typical earnings in civilian employment. Non-general regulations of abnormal character as were affected were adopted tardily and in piecemeal fashion. Many men believed a continuation of effective wage controls to be politically impossible. In any event, many careful and competent observers believe that the issuance of this executive order was in effect the dynamite breaching the dam which was shortly afterward to burst.

While the prosecution of major wars by this country has consistently been co-existent with marked increases in the cost of living, this relationship is not unavoidable. If, however, natural persons and business enterprises retain a large measure of freedom, if free markets are not largely or entirely eliminated, prices determined in relatively free markets remain as a significant factor. 

To the man in the street, inflation generally means price inflation, or increases in the prices of items, particularly commodities, bought and sold. To state the latter in other terms, inflation is considered as synonymous with significant increases in the cost of living.

Inflation Not Unavoidable

The comment made in this article will be bottomed on the assumption that the mounting tide of inflation in this country, which is quite obvious to any person who is not a hermit, is a symptom of an aggravated economic illness, an illness of such seriousness as to warrant the solicitude of all citizens. But before any remedial measures may be logically proposed, it is essential that there be an understanding of the causal factors, hence the comments which follow:

cdissaving: remain as the main canalizing instrument. Many other persons were in- | decided inflationary. In fact, the take-home pay on the anti- | inflationary influence, if consumer choices are not | reduced by favorable wage and salary | increases, the anticipated postwar 40-hour week equal | greatly restricted. | It is said that the | bonds outstanding in the | about 40.5 billion, while the | present figure is about 52 billion. | This increase of about 5.5 billion | has been more than offset by the | increase in consumer credit out- | standing. | Similarly, while the continuation of | ordinary productive activity by | many business enterprises was pre- | vented by a system of priorities | and allocations, a positive induce- | ment to produce essential materials | was effected by the offer of finan- | cially profitable contracts. Thus, at | the very outset of the war, the | forces were at work tending to | enhance the going rates of re- | muneration (income) of factors of | production, and in effect, “The war is over; | back to normalcy.” But much ear- | lier than many expected, in fact on | August 18, 1945, President Truman | issued his fateful executive order | for War Labor Board approval of wage | increases, subject only to the pro- | viso that such increases as were | effected without approval could not | be used as a basis for increases in | price ceilings or to resist other | justifiable reductions in such | ceilings. Parenthetically, it may be | offered as a surmise that President | Truman was influenced by those | prognosticators who foresaw a | million men unemployed within a | few months, hence a return of the | market in labor. It may be that the President (at | the time) believed that any mal- | adjustment in the labor market | would be immediately inflationary in the presence | of a considerable accumulation of | disposable funds in the hands of | wage earners and many other in- | come recipients were further in- | creased by an enlarged volume of | employment, AC rates for | bonuses, plant increases, subject | to the government, etc. | Now if all of the increased volume | of employment had been devoted | to the production of consumption | goods, justifiable reductions in such | ceilings.

Inflationary possibilities | might have been considerably les- | sened or eliminated entirely. | Again, people might have voluntarily pur- | chased, or have been compelled to | purchase, such government bonds | as to effect the | proper reduction in disposable funds. | Finally, people might have subjected themselves to a self-im- | posed austerity policy relative to | their purchases of consumer goods. | The Congress did increase the effective rates of taxes and imposed | measures to induce bond purchases; | and some persons, as a patriotic | measure, voluntarily kept their ex- | penditures for goods and services | below the quantity for which they could pay, thus in- | creasing their savings.
