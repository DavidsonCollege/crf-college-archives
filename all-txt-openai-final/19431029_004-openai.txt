“Y” RETREAT

The Y.M.C.A. cabinet will begin its annual retreat on Friday, October 29. It has been customary to hold these meetings
in order to increase the spiritual outlook of the members and to formulate plans for the coming year.

Montreat has been chosen as the place of meeting. Two of the chief topics will be the completion of plans
for all Services and the choice of a goal for the gift fund.

The success of these meetings in the past has always increased the effectiveness of the work of the Y.M.C.A.

New Hostess Comes To ‘Y’

Mrs. Gordon Caldwell, a native of Columbia, South Carolina, is serving this year as hostess of the Y.M.C.A. Guest House
and as Supervisor of the Dormitories.

Mrs. Caldwell graduated from Winthrop College and took postgraduate work in dietetics. She is also especially qualified for her position
as “Y” hostess, having been dietitian of the Charlotte Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat Hospital and of the Mecklenburg Sanatorium.

The post of Guest House manager was formerly held by Mrs. Rufus B. Wilson of Burlington, N.C.; that of Dormitory
Supervisor by Mrs. N. T. Smith.

Mrs. Smith still has her home in Davidson. She has been given special commendation for her work with, and love
for, the students of Davidson. The 1943 edition of the Quips and Cranks, the college annual, was dedicated to her.
