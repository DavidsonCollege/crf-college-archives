Super Start.

career.

"We’ll be in a better position to afford things later on than we are right now," says Theresa K. Carroll,
Class of '71 UNC—CH. Getting Terry’s degree in accounting was the first hurdle. Now her goal is to get a
post-graduate degree. Sure, Terry has a good job in her field with the Highway Department. But expenses and emergencies won’t
wait. Like when the motor in their furnace burned out. The car was beginning to cost more to repair than
payments on a new one. This and more happened the year that First-Citizens Bank invented $uper $tart. So Terry was
able to master things as they came.
