We knew that we were in the right place when we bought our tickets — a framed picture of us
atop his motorcycle sat on the ticket table. We were freshmen then, new roommates, and we had just seen RenElvis
for the first time. Now we are seniors, and Saturday night we went to see him for the last time.

The 50’s dance is often overlooked by those who think they are too cool. They are missing out. Where else
can you find the English Department dancing in leather jackets? President Kuykendall doing the Macarena? Elvis lives! Dean Shandley wearing
sunglasses at night? A Filipino Elvis impersonator who sings in not only English but Greek?

He didn’t sing in Greek on Saturday, but he still gave us a great show.

Born in the Philippines, RenElvis sings the hits of the King like Liberace would sing the blues. But you don’t
notice the incongruity of his accent while you watch him sing in his gold and white outfit and blinking-light belt.
You don’t compare him to Elvis. You love him for who he is.

We loved him so much freshman year that we called his fan club number. Ren himself answered and was thrilled
that we were fans. We soon got a RenElvis package in the mail — included with membership was a t-shirt
with a RenElvis decal and a tape of his greatest hits. An information packet included the names of all of
his fan club members (Carrie is #9).

Rarely do you see so many different facets of the Davidson community come together. Professors dance with their sons and
daughters, elementary school children compete in the dance contest, high schoolers flirt, and college students help run the show. And
when the Filipino King comes out on stage, the entire crowd goes crazy.

RenElvis does it like no one can.

**Faculty art exhibit explores fascinations with the past, the mind, and the insane**

The faculty art exhibit at the Van Every Gallery provided me with my first exposure to art at Davidson. Debra
Fisher, a printmaker and new member of the art faculty, presented her works in the Van Every gallery. I really
connected with her prints which involve a deep and personal element.

Symbolism plays a key role in her art, with religious themes involving life, nature, and death. Each work had a
spirit of its own to which I could relate.

Her main exhibition, Print/Book Installation and Mixed Media Works, encompasses the passage of time through visual memories of people close
to the artist. I saw her work as a look to the past, surrounded by pain, love, and peace.

As I moved into the next section of the gallery, I was introduced to the sculptures of Cort Savage. His
works in the Silence and Stillness and The Sleep of Reason exhibitions impressed me by his use of kinetics. His
sculptures give a sense of timelessness and peace which contrast with his use of physical movement. He puts compassion into
his work and compares form with continuity.

Savage uses such materials as a piano, the wings of a finch, bronze drawings, and placement of sand to appeal
to the senses of the viewer, not only visually but also audibly.

I then entered the painting world of Herb Jackson, a world composed of radiant color and expression. His series of
Small Oil Paintings are personified with feeling. He feels that his paintings are a metaphor for life. Their unpredictability and
failure lead to new beginnings.

He starts with nothing and as he creates the painting, he communicates with it until it eventually resolves itself.

Jackson says that his works do not necessarily mean anything in particular, but they do have various layers and scraping
shown in the art. I saw his works as visual interpretations of his mind, truly stunning and internal.

As I left the exhibit, I was overcome with a greater appreciation of art and its place at Davidson. I
encourage others to take the time to view these works and respond to them in their own way.
