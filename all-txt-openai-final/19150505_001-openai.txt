The DAVIDSONIAN VOL 2. Carolina Defeated In Dual Track Meet Total Score 70-47---Gilchrist Bests Plaxico, Carolina’s Star.

At the dual track meet between the University of South Carolina and Davidson, held in Columbia, S. C., last Saturday, the Davidson track team by hard fighting succeeded in taking every first place but two in the entire meet. The feature of the meet was the running of Gilchrist, who defeated Plaxico, the pride of Carolina, in both the 100 yard and the 220 yard dashes. Because of a misunderstanding of the timekeepers, the time for the 100 yard dash was not recorded. Everyone agrees, however, that the time was unusually fast—ten seconds flat at least. The 220 yard dash was one of the prettiest races seen in Columbia recently. Gilchrist, representing Davidson, was penalized one yard at the start. Plaxico and Bowen, of Carolina, thus held the lead for the first 120 yards. By a wonderful burst of speed at the finish, Gilchrist flashed by the Carolina sprinters, winning by several yards. Crouch, of Davidson, ran a very plucky race in the 440 yard dash. Falling into a pocket, and having the outside track the whole distance around the 1/4 mile track, he ran even with the other runners, easily outdistancing them on the straightaway. Anderson, L. H., made 18 points for Davidson, winning the hammer, shot, discus, and tying for first in the high jump. The events follow:

100 Yard Dash—Gilchrist, Davidson, 1st; Plaxico, Carolina, and Bowen, Carolina, tied. (Through a misunderstanding no time was taken).

Varsity Ends Season With Two Victories
Takes Series From South Carolina --- Wolterd the Last Victim.

On the York County Fairgrounds, in Rock Hill, April 29, Davidson defeated the University of South Carolina by the score of 7 to 0 in a fast game. Irvin Groome mowed the Gamecocks down for nine innings without a single hit off his delivery. At no time during the entire game did they threaten to score. He was in wonderful form, causing the University lads to pop up easy chances and roll gentle grounders to the infield. The only thing which resembled a hit off the Davidson pitcher was a sharp tap made by Langston which Groome knocked down but recovered too late to catch the runner at first. Babe Adams was hit freely by Red and Black; however, the game would have been much closer had his team given him support. He managed to keep his hits well scattered and was stingy with free passes to first. In the eighth inning, Davidson was able to score four runs, two of them being counted by the squeeze play, which worked to perfection. The game was the third of the Davidson-South Carolina series, each team having taken one of the preceding pair, thereby giving the series to Davidson.

Score by innings:
Davidson... 020 010 04x — 7
South Carolina 000 000 000 — 0

Summary: Base on balls, off Groome 1, off Adams 2; struck out, by Groome 8, by Adams 5; hit by pitched ball, Hengeveldt; stolen bases, Christenbury (2), Browne, Reesler; left on bases, Davidson 6, Carolina 6; first base errors, Davidson 4, Carolina 2; time, 2:00; umpires, Messrs. McCoy and Nofford; attendance 600.

ALSO DEFEATS WOFFORD.

On Saturday, May 1, the Red and Black ended its season by defeating Wofford by the overwhelming score of 12 to 3. At the beginning of the game, Wofford scored 3 runs, 2 of them coming in the first and 1 in the second inning, by bunching hits; but after the second inning, Lawson tightened up and allowed the visitors only two more safeties during the rest of the game. Davidson scored at will, chasing Haunberg from the mound in the first, and found Eaddy, who replaced him, almost as easy. Sixteen hits were totaled from these two twirlers. Christenbury and Browne led in the hitting, the former securing three singles out of four times up and the latter a three-bagger and two doubles out of five times up. Practically all the team hit with two.

The features for the visitors were the batting of Osborne, L., who found Lawson for two triples out of five times up, and Wiggins and Moore, with two singles.

Score by innings:
Davidson 418 302 00x — 12
Wofford 210 000 000 — 3

Summary: Two-base hits, Browne (2), Alford; three-base hits, Browne, Osborne, L. (2); stolen bases, Christenbury (2), Wood, Alford, Groome; struck out, by Eaddy 5, Lawson 6; wild pitch, Eaddy; time, 2:15; umpire, Crayton.

A unique feature of the occasion is to be the reunion of the classes of 1885, 1895, 1900, 1905, 1908, and 1910. News from the officers of these classes indicates a record-breaking attendance, and preparation is now being made for their reception. Since the accommodations of the town are unusually overcrowded at this time, one of the dormitories (probably Watts) is to be given over to the alumni as their headquarters. Through special arrangement, the members of these classes are to receive The Davidsonian until that time, for their information and convenience. Any communications concerning the class reunions will gladly be published.

A novel departure from the regular gymnasium exhibit is to be a preliminary (Continued on page 6).
