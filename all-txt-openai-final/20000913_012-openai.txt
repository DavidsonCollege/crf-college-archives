**Wildcats dominate Dolphins in opener**

**Defense holds Jacksonville to only 69 yards while Fish and Nichols lead the offense to 424 yards**

When the 2000 football season began, there were few questions about the Davidson defense. Anchored by senior All-Americans Bo Henderson and Ryan Crawford, the Wildcat defense was primed for success. The jury was still out on the Wildcats’ sometimes-stagnant offense, which relied heavily last season on running back Eric Ferguson. Accompanying Ferguson’s departure was the arrival of new head coach Joe Susan and the announcement of sophomore Paul Nichols as the starting quarterback over senior Shaun Tyrance. Many wondered whether young Nichols could handle the pressure of the starting role and, more importantly, what an offense so dependent on the running game would do without its star runner.

However, after Saturday’s 36-7 rout of the Jacksonville Dolphins, those questions were answered. Nichols, who completed 18 of 25 passes for 223 yards and two touchdowns, called it “the most dominant game the Cats ever played.” Coach Susan held the same opinion of the effort, stating that “Anytime you hold a team to 69 yards of total offense, you know you are playing well.” What may be more impressive is that the Dolphins racked up seventy-four yards in the first period but were held to negative five yards the rest of the game.

Throughout the game, Nichols distributed the ball evenly to all of his targets. The sophomore quarterback was cool under pressure, often completing passes while in the grasp of defenders. Leading the receivers was senior wide receiver Corey Crawford, who caught 6 passes for 86 yards, including the ‘Cats second touchdown. “We wanted to run the ball and open up the pass. We wanted to have a good mix,” explained Nichols.

Aiding Crawford in the Wildcat attack was sophomore wide receiver Mike Chase, who added 5 catches for 67 yards. However, the most impressive performance came from senior tailback Bryan Fish. Fish, a former safety, carried the ball 20 times for 143 yards. It was his first start at tailback since his freshman year. Fish fought for every yard possible, often gaining ground after being hit by several Dolphin defenders. He moved the chains on multiple third-down opportunities to sustain Wildcat drives. His effort and the push of the offensive line forced Jacksonville to sacrifice their pass defense in hopes of stopping the run.

Ryan Crawford opened the game with an 86-yard kickoff return for the first touchdown of the afternoon. Although Jacksonville would tie the game late in the 1st quarter on an impressive drive capped off by an 11-yard run by running back George Portee, it would prove to be their only score and, more importantly, their last real scoring opportunity. The Wildcats regained the lead on a safety by senior defensive back Ryan Hutto, who corralled the Jacksonville kicker in the back of the endzone, followed by a 50-yard touchdown drive in the closing seconds of the 1st half.

According to Nichols, the touchdown which came at the end of the first half occurred on a botched play.play. “We called the wrong play in the huddle. And it’s a credit to the guys up front, and Corey (Crawford) made a hell of a catch.” Of the play, Crawford said, “I saw him in trouble so I followed the play and waited for the ball to come down.” The Davidson offense then dominated the second half, adding two more touchdowns, one courtesy of Bryan Fish, and a field goal by sophomore Dan Hanks, whose punting and kicking did not go without notice. One offensive correction that the ‘Cats will need to make before Saturday’s game is limiting their number of turnovers, which totaled 5 on Saturday, 4 of which were made by Nichols. Coach Susan said that the ‘Cats simply “need to be smarter with the football. When you come out of a game with five turnovers, you usually aren’t looking to win.” Despite the turnovers, Davidson was more than impressive in their weekend debut. With Dolphins, critics fell silent. Chase, who caught 5 passes, is undoubtedly a weapon. 

“To win against Jacksonville, undoubtedly, is a reflection of the tremendous effort that players and coaches have put forth since August 12th.” - Bo Henderson

The combination of the newly designed Davidson offense, featuring multiple formations and an aggressive style, and the already stellar Davidson defense gave new head coach Joe Susan an impressive home win in his first game on the Davidson sideline. The ‘Cats earned a total of 424 yards while holding their opponents to 69 in what one fan described as a dominant performance. Fish eludes Dolphin defenders. According to Coach Susan, we should expect even more plays of this nature from Chase, who “routinely” makes such receptions in practice. Although the sophomore quarterback and his receiving corps made a solid debut, perhaps the most impressive offensive performance came from Bryan Fish with 20 carries for 143 yards. 

With the talent of freshman Randall Hardy and sophomore Chase, the 2000 season looks bright for the Wildcats. Davidson’s next game is Saturday at Sewanee beginning at 2:30 p.m. Ryan Hutto and Ryan Crawford were named Division 1-AA players of the week. Hutto was defensive player of the week (eight tackles, six solo, five for loss, two sacks), Crawford special teams for his kick return. Bo Henderson earned the Black Shirt award for the biggest hit. Mike Anderson and Corey Crawford make the incredible catch in traffic.
