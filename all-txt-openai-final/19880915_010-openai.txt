Wildcats fall in Colonial opener to Lehigh 43-20

By BRUCE NEWSOME

The Davidson football team was unable to put everything together Saturday as it lost its Colonial League opener to the Lehigh Brown and White 43-20. The offense was unable to get on track in the 1st half, while the defense played well, and in the 2nd half the offense got in gear, but the defense struggled.

In the first half, Davidson was only able to gain 36 yards total offense. Twice when it appeared that the Cats might be starting a drive, quarterback Peter Hughes had perfect passes dropped by his receivers. On the other 5 series, Hughes was scrambling for his life as the Brown and White defensive line spent much of the half in the Davidson backfield.

Lehigh drew 1st blood midway through the 1st quarter. The Brown and White utilized their short passing attack to drive 67 yards for a touchdown. The holder fumbled the extra-point snap to leave the score 6-0.

However, disaster struck with 1:52 left in the second quarter. The week before against Presbyterian, the Cats had punting problems as the Blue Hose almost blocked 2 kicks. In spite of a change in punters this week, the punting game had problems as Lehigh’s Jim Benson came from the left end to block Chris Hardin’s punt at the Davidson 10-yard line. Another Lehigh player recovered the blocked kick and ran it in for a touchdown to increase the Brown and White’s lead to 19-0 at the half.

Head Coach Vic Gatto said after the game: “We wanted to go in down 12-0, but there is a big difference in being down 12-0 and 19-0.”

In the second half, Davidson’s offense awoke and gained 291 yards total offense and 20 points; an impressive 92-yard drive in 15 plays for their 1st touchdown. Midway through the third quarter, the Davidson offense went on another drive. The big play on the drive was a 25-yard completion from Hughes to Horace Hamm which gave the Cats 1st and goal at the Lehigh 4. However, the defense was unable to stop the Brown and White on their next drive. The touchdown was scored on a nice 30-yard run by Laurence Amico through the Davidson defense.

Davidson’s punting woes continued on the next series when the Lehigh kick returner took Hardin’s punt 64 yards for a touchdown to make the score 36-7. Despite being down by so much, the Wildcats did not quit. On first and ten from the Davidson 38, Hamm burned the Lehigh secondary and Hughes hit him with a 62-yard touchdown pass. Both teams scored touchdowns on their next possession to round out the scoring at Lehigh 43-Davidson 20.

Although Davidson lost, this game was a big improvement over last year’s 47-0 embarrassment at Lehigh. The Cats will try to turn improvement into victory Sept. 24 in the Bronx against future Colonial League member Fordham.

SOCCER, from page 9

Several opportunities for each side, but no goals. The second...Half remained tied until the fifteen-minute mark, when the Paladins, playing a man down, broke the scoring drought. Furman later added an insurance goal to seal the 2-0 victory. Slagle noted that the team played hard in the match but was guilty of too many unforced errors. The simple things, such as passing and trapping, were not properly executed. Slagle felt that lack of concentration was a major problem in the contest.

Tuesday, Belmont Abbey came to town and handed the Cats their worst loss in several years. The visitors got the first goal with about twenty-two minutes to go in the half. The dam then broke, as four more scores were added to give Belmont Abbey a commanding 5-0 halftime advantage. In the second half, some order was restored, as Belmont was held to only one goal while the Cats got scores from Friedlander and Peter Cobb. The 6-2 final was most disappointing, as this was a contest the Cats had expected, and needed, to win. The season is still young, and the team has played a difficult schedule. Slagle hopes the team will play more to its potential in its next matches.

Cats defeated in volleyball tournament

Davidson faced some tough competition and played some close games, but they came up short Friday night, losing to East Carolina (15-11, 16-14, 15-13). On Saturday, the Wildcats played a strong team from UNC-Wilmington who played together in the USVBA last winter. Although the score was 15-4, 15-10, 15-8 in favor of the Seahawks, Coach Rebecca Hawkins felt that her squad had held tough against a powerful opponent. Davidson closed out the tournament matches by taking UNC-Asheville to five games, losing 15-8 in the fifth. Leading the ‘Cats were Maria Douglas, Michelle Plauche, and Holt Hathaway.

NOTES: Davidson continues to be hampered by the absence of Tracy Hankins, who is sidelined with a knee injury. The possibility exists that Hankins might file for a redshirt year with the N.C.A.A. Slagle offered no comment when posed the question. Davidson has begun to concentrate more on defense in practice, hoping to prevent their opponents from jumping out to an early lead. In previous matches, the ‘Cats have started out behind and have been forced to play catch-up, largely due to a lack of confidence. The Davidson varsity volleyball program is still young and has not yet established a winning tradition. But, according to Hawkins, “this team is much better than last year’s, and we hope to continue improving.” The Wildcats will play this weekend at the ECU tournament in Greenville. They will then play Gardner-Webb on Tuesday and will return home Thursday to take on Coastal Carolina at 7:00 in Johnston Gym.
