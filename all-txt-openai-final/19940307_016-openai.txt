President John Kuykendall and Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid Nancy Cable Wells discuss the 13.5% cap on financial aid and Davidson's future.

Given what we know about financial aid at Davidson, what strategies in the face of the cap are most likely to meet our goals of cost containment and an able and diverse student body?

**President Kuykendall:** Obviously, among the things that must be done is to raise more money in funding which is directed explicitly to financial aid. We intend to raise our goal in the Campaign for Davidson in the area of financial aid and to expand that because we’ve really already achieved the goal we set out to reach. That effort, which will certainly be successful, will have to be succeeded by other efforts to continue to raise that portion of the endowment which will be dedicated to financial aid. That’s one thing we have to do. We also are going to have to discover appropriate ways in which to allocate resources, on one hand to meet the needs of those students who ought to be at Davidson in the best way we can, and on the other hand, to provide at least some basis for a merit program which attracts people with special talents irrespective of the needs they have. So we’ve got to balance that. We are in the process of learning about the balance between need-based aid and non-need aid, particularly special talents and gifts. It’s going to take us a while, I think, to discover the happy medium where we’re going to have to do both kinds of financial aid using resources generated through restricted funds, the endowment, and also using resources we have available within the budget of the college under the cap of 13.5%.

The committee that proposed the cap stated in its final report that fundraising efforts for financial aid should be stepped up to meet this need. What’s being done or planned in that area?

**President Kuykendall:** That does respond to that because obviously when we designed the campaign originally, we foresaw $20,000,000 within the $150,000,000 for financial aid. We reached that overall goal, though, in reverse of what we’d anticipated because our hope at that point was that we’d add $5,000,000 on the need-based side and we would add a $15,000,000 merit package of some sort. We’ve gotten, I think, a little more precise, if not sophisticated, in the way that we’ve looked at what merit aid ought to be since we drafted the original proposal. But what has happened in the early stages of the campaign is that the response from most of our constituencies who are interested in giving to financial aid has been on the need-based side rather than the merit side. One of the efforts we’re making, especially in this latter phase of the campaign, and along a certain kind of contingent after the campaign goal is reached, is on the merit side to see what we can do to put that whole piece together.

**Dean Cable Wells:** What that might say is that some of the donors among the Davidson family who have chosen to give to this purpose have recognized the importance of need-based aid to keep Davidson affordable and accessible to students of all different kinds of groups. Now we’re sure we can go out and raise more merit aid on top of that need-based.

**President Kuykendall:** One other passing comment on the terminology we’re using: maybe we should be saying need versus non-need because everyone has merit, but non-need is a kind of a non-term. We’re trying to say grants that are given irrespective of need, but may be given to people who have great need at the same time, but will be given on the basis of some particular talent or accomplishment.

**Dean Cable Wells:** Another way to think about that, too, is that in the admission and financial aid effort, at least as far as bringing first-year students to Davidson, we’re trying to shape a class. We’re not going to reject everyone below this SAT and accept everyone above it; instead, we’re going to try to pick a group, in sets of talents, among the pool of applied students, and shape a class that is vital and vigorous in itself.

Does the cap jeopardize our continuing efforts to enhance Davidson’s diversity?

**President Kuykendall:** I think we have reason to be concerned about all kinds of possible implications of the cap, but I would think that on the scale of things, the issue of diversity may be a little better off than some of the other concerns because there will be monies targeted for special circumstances. It’s too soon to tell what the cap’s going to do. We’re trying to minimize the impact of it, and one of the things in the budget that the trustees adopted this year was a little bit of a cushion to help us make sure that the entering class, the class of ‘98, doesn’t bear the brunt of the onset of the cap. So, we can kind of cushion the blow and also be very, very sensitive and responsive, year by year, to what’s going on. The cap, though it’s a set policy of the trustees—the trustees are certainly not going to let any policy stay in existence for very long if it’s proving to be detrimental to these kinds of goals. So, I think we’re encouraged to think that we can make necessary adjustments as they are apparent to us, but we’re committed right now to try to implement the trustee policy and work with the cap. I think the answer to your question is that we don’t know what may come. It’s a situation in which we’re anxious, but I don’t think the sky is falling in. It’s not.

**Dean Cable Wells:** It’s not a threatening situation; it’s a matter of that fine-tuning of a balance that puts in check a controlled expense that was running out of control relative to the other needs of the college. It may mean, in the most optimistic way, if our donors really come forward, we may have the opportunity to be in a better place than we could have ever been just based on college funds. This cost containment effort gives us the chance to say to other members of the Davidson family: this is what we want to be; this is what makes a vital education and we need you to help us to become that.

**President Kuykendall:** And we’ve...already received good response on that front. There are three or four scholarship funds already in the process of being established by donors which are responsive precisely to the need for diversity. I think Dean Cable Wells’ statement is correct: I think we compensate in the contributions and in the dedicated funds that are outside the 13.5% cap, and we may see a compensation that really makes us more optimistic than otherwise.

Dean Cable Wells: I think this trustee policy does call for this evaluation. We’re building systems so we'll know whether this thing is working or what impact it’s having as we get through the process a little further, not just this year but in the ensuing years. My sense is that we all want to consider, to evaluate, to study this issue and the effects it’s having, pro and con.

How will the monies “saved” from these cost containment efforts be used?

President Kuykendall: That’s hard to peg. If recent experience is any index of what the future looks like, there will be two or three areas in which we will be obliged to stand tall. One has to do with appropriate compensation for faculty and staff. We are, in general, in an unfavorable comparison with most of our peer institutions in terms of what we are able to pay in salary benefits to faculty and staff. That has been priority number one, even before financial aid, for most of the ten years I’ve been here, and has to continue. Another thing that we’re confronting is the fact that we cannot afford the “luxury” of allowing our campus facilities to run down over a period of time, a phenomenon which is known as deferred maintenance. This year’s budget, for example, provides a sum of $300,000 for coming to grips with some very basic maintenance problems on this campus, a lot of which are not too glamorous. But basically, we’re really not talking about savings; we’re not going to get money back; we’re just going to hold the line there so those percentages don’t diminish. What we’re talking about is not saving money to put somewhere else. What you’re talking about is avoiding further erosion of other budgets. But your question is fair; where is the money going to be spent? It’s going to be spent on people and facilities.

Given the risks of capping financial aid, what do you hope will happen?

President Kuykendall: Of course, in the best of all possible worlds, we maintain, or even in some areas we enhance, the goals for which we were provided for financial aid to begin with. And if we continue to have to cap, and it’s probably the case that we will, we want to minimize the number of students who are accepted at Davidson, who want to be at Davidson, and who ought to be at Davidson, but who are unable to afford to come to Davidson. We’ve got to find the most creative way of packaging—that’s the genius that Dean Cable Wells and colleagues are going to have to demonstrate in the next little bit: that we make each dollar go as far as it possibly can and that we provide appropriate encouragement to everybody who is accepted, who wants to be here, and should be here to actually go through Davidson and get to the other end without an unbearable burden of debt.

Is there anything else you want to add?

President Kuykendall: Well, I think we don’t often enough say the kind of gratitude the college feels toward this committee. When Dean Cable Wells got here a year and a half ago, the first thing I said to her was that we needed to set up this work group that would evaluate how we would implement the policy that the trustees adopted the previous spring. And that group worked tirelessly throughout last year, and they really did an incredible job. This is not something that everybody in the community watches like you watch a basketball game or a concert. This is a small group of dedicated people drawn broadly from this community including students, faculty members, administrators, trustees, and others who just kind of dig in and say, how are we going to solve this problem? They do this; they invest themselves in it; they have a great deal of ownership of it; and yet then they are willing to test what they have done for the rest of us in the community who haven’t gone step by step with them. And we’ll continue adjusting to make it the best we can.

A Changing Davidson

Though the Davidson community has only recently begun to realize the implications of the 13.5% cap on financial aid, the Admissions and Financial Aid Offices, President Kuykendall, administrators, faculty, and even students have been preparing for the effects since the trustees adopted the policy in ‘92. Davidson will no longer be able to guarantee all entering freshmen financial aid covering 100% demonstrated need; however, the trustees felt the cap necessary to retain a balanced college budget.

With the effects of the cap quickly becoming a reality in the upcoming year, the situation seems all the more serious. The Financial Aid Planning Team has already devised a set of strategies to compensate for the inadequate funds in an effort to maintain an academically able and diverse student body. The team, headed by Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid Nancy Cable Wells, calls for Admissions to maintain its “need-blind” admission policy in reviewing applicants. As always, students will be considered equally, regardless of their needs.

The Campaign for Davidson and other efforts launched by the Development Office will continue to raise money for financial aid, both need- and merit-based. According to Dean Cable Wells, the stronger applicants will receive the full packages while those who are not as academically able will be “gapped,” or offered packages that provide for only 85% to 90% of the demonstrated need. For next year and into the future, 50 to 100 "gapped" freshmen will find their financial aid packages cut short around $2000. In the spring of ‘95, after two years’ work within the constraints of the cap, a modified Financial Aid Planning Team will be revitalized to study and evaluate the effects, positive and negative.
