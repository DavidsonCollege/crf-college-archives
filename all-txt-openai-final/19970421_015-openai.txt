Baseball battles, but falls to Duke
By MICHAEL KRUSE

DURHAM — Wednesday’s baseball game here at Duke’s Blue Devil Stadium was one of state- Unfortunately for the Wildcats, the Blue Devils more often than not had the final word. Three of the four times Davidson scored in the top half of an inning, Duke responded with as many or more runs in the bottom. In the third, the Wildcats scored one and the Blue Devils scored two, and in both the fifth and sixth, each team scored three. The numbers ultimately added up to a 12-9 victory for the Blue Devils (27-16), who then hit the road for a three-game weekend series in Miami with the perennially nationally-ranked Hurricanes. But the contest did represent a marked improvement from the ugly loss to N.C. State, as the Wildcats (18-26) pounded out 11 hits and were never really out of contention.

“We battled well,” said coach Dick Cooke. “We were in the ballgame and much more ready to play (than we were against State).”

Catcher Kurt Davis, who platoons behind the plate with Dom Talvacchio and Chris Cox, went 3-for-4, including an RBI and two doubles — one a towering drive to the wall in left, the other a low liner into the left field corner.

“Kurt struggled early this season, but he’s been swinging the bat really well lately,” Cooke explained. “And his play behind the plate has been good.”

Marshall Tyler pieced together a solid day at the plate, going 1-for-2 with a walk, an RBI, and three runs scored. Jeff Coker also added two hits. Duke, which began the season at 15-3 and has not been as sharp recently, was paced by leadoff hitter and shortstop Vaughn Schill, and a prolific middle of the lineup. Schill collected three hits in five at-bats and the Blue Devils’ 4-5-6-7 hitters teamed to rap nine hits, and accounted for seven RBIs and nine runs. Otherwise, starter Brandon Davis and reliever Ricky Paugh pitched well, allowing just seven earned runs and striking out eight in as many innings of work.

Baseball hangs close through four, Wolfpack bats ignite late for win

RALEIGH — The baseball team struck for two quick first-inning runs against ACC power North Carolina State Tuesday night here at Doak Field. And after four innings, the Wildcats stood knotted at 4-4 with the Wolfpack. Then all hell broke loose. State (32-11) scored the game’s final 18 runs — five in both the fifth and sixth, and eight in the seventh — to earn a dominant 22-4 victory over the Wildcats (18-25).

“We didn’t play particularly well defensively,” said coach Dick Cooke, referring to his team’s five errors. “And there were some balls we should have made plays on. Jamie (McDonald) threw pretty well, but didn’t have his usual command. He didn’t throw badly though.”

Not at all. McDonald, who started on the mound for the Wildcats, settled down after an iffy three-run first and contained State’s lineup through the next three innings. But the potent Wolfpack — which boasts an overall .328 batting clip and three .400 hitters, and had produced an eye-popping 28-9 win over Maryland just two days earlier — knocked McDonald out of the game in the fifth and proceeded to put on a jaw-dropping show of offensive fireworks at the expense of the Davidson relief corps. Fritz Porter, Derek Coombs, and Mike DeSimone combined for two innings pitched in which State tallied 13 runs on 13 hits. Dynamic second baseman Tom Sergio led the 22-hit parade, going 4-for-6 with a homer and six RBIs. Chris Combs, a hulking 6-foot-8 first baseman, also homered. Overall, six State players finished with two or more runs driven in.

Ricky Paugh stopped the bleeding, throwing a perfect eighth. Ben Brown, Luke Goodwin, Jeff Coker, Anderson Marvin, Chad Fogleman, and Chris Cox all had one hit for the Wildcats.

Two freshmen claim singles titles
By JAY CANTRELL
Staff Writer

When men’s tennis coach Jeff Frank set up the annual tryout tournament back in August, no one could have thought it would feature two 1997 Southern Conference Tournament Champions.

“I was just hoping I would be anywhere on the team,” said freshman Alex Okulski. He and fellow classmate Brett Ialacci were more than just on the team. The newcomers won championships in the number six and number three singles flights, respectively. Both were seeded No. 1 in their first ever Southern Conference Tournament.

Ialacci started out slowly in his first match Friday, but held on for a 7-6 (7-4), 6-3 victory. “I wasn’t very focused,” he said. That changed, however, during the next two days, as he knocked off Armen Safarian of East Tennessee State 6-1, 6-3 on Saturday and followed that with a 6-1, 6-4 win over Furman’s Erik deVries for the championship on Sunday. In each of those two matches, Ialacci gave up the first three games of the second set after winning the first. “(Coach Frank) told me to move my feet, concentrate, and keep the ball to the guy’s backhand,” Ialacci said. That strategy worked as Ialacci won six of the next seven games to take the duel in straight sets.

Okulski’s road to the title included only two matches. He received a bye in the first round because he was the No. 1 seed. On Saturday the freshman defeated Chris Duncan of The Citadel 6-2, 6-4. The following day he clinched the championship with a 6-2, 6-2 win against Matt Keeter of East Tennessee State. Keeter was the sixth seed in the flight, but his Cinderella run ended when he faced off with Okulski in the finals. “I just wanted to be aggressive and force him to make shots,” he said. “He goes to the net more than I do,” Ialacci said of his teammate. “I'd rather just let the other guy miss.”
