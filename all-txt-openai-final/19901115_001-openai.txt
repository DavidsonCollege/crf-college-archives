**PiKA "Poisoning" Due To Stomach Virus**  
By JENNY SCARBOROUGH

After dining on shrimp creole on Monday, November 5, 17 members of PiKA were admitted to the infirmary that Tuesday night because of nausea, cramping, and diarrhea. The Mecklenburg County Health Department’s analysis of the food determined the cause to be a stomach virus, which was apparently spread by a person with the virus handling the meal.

According to Derrick Willard, PiKA president, some students who are not members of PiKA have visited the infirmary with similar symptoms. “It was strange that so many guys got it at the same time,” said Willard, “That made us suspect food poisoning, but it wasn’t.”

About 24 hours after the meal, the effects of the virus were felt. People began filling the infirmary. One freshman who dined at PiKA was also affected. Dot Fleming, who is the infirmary supervisor, administered nausea shots and ginger ale to prevent dehydration. The symptoms lasted for about 24 hours, but most felt weak for several days afterward. Said Fleming, “They were uncomfortable, but they all got along fine. It wasn’t a life-threatening situation.”

In all, about thirty people were checked as a precaution. Two members who were unable to stop vomiting drove themselves to the hospital in Charlotte. On Wednesday PiKA decided to close their kitchen and eat at the Commons until the cause of the illness was determined. Each fraternity and eating house operates its own kitchen; they are entirely separate from the college’s dining service. Willard expressed PiKA’s thanks to the Commons for their cooperation. “Everyone’s eating at the house now and everything’s back to normal,” said Willard.

**Casolo’s Speech Stirred By Debate**  
By SARAH SADOWSKI

El Salvador is a small Central American country currently being torn apart by civil war. On Sunday night, Davidson got a small but significant taste of the Salvadoran conflict amidst a room full of tension, animosity, love, and solidarity. Jennifer Casolo, an American-raised, Brandeis-educated woman who worked in El Salvador for four-and-a-half years, shared some of her perspectives and experiences last Sunday at 7:30 p.m. in the 900 Room.

Casolo, who was accused of allegedly hiding arms for the guerrillas, the FMLN, in the backyard of her home in El Salvador, was arrested by the Salvadoran government. She has since been ordered by the Salvadoran government to leave the country, although she still claims innocence of all charges. Casolo came to Davidson to speak about her experiences, including those of her work with the Salvadoran people, her arrest, and her imprisonment. She was met by both admiration and animosity.

**Thieves on Davidson, "It's Easy Pickin's"**  
By GARY WHEELER

The Davidson College Police Department’s high visibility this year has resulted in greater recovery rates of stolen property. Crime on campus, however, is not decreasing. Ray Thrower, Chief of Police, says that Davidson students’ habits of leaving dorm rooms and bicycles unlocked have given the college a reputation for being “easy pickin’s.” Of the 128 cases of theft reported, there was only one case where the victim had locked his or her door. “Crime in Mecklenburg is increasing,” Thrower said, “and Davidson is not isolated from this crime.” Thrower encourages Davidson students, faculty, and staff to be more vigilant.

**Bone Marrow Transplant Aids Student In Fight For Life**  
By DAVID LINDSAY  
[Editors’ Note: This is the first of two articles on the transplant of bone marrow]

Why me? This question is often asked in the face of life’s adversity. Life can seem unfair in so many ways--innocent people are killed by drunk drivers, an unlucky bystander gets shot by a stray bullet, a woman is brutally raped, young children suffer from deadly diseases.diseases, and the list goes on... I have discovered that when life issues forth a difficult challenge, the best course to take is to meet that challenge head-on and at full speed. As Theodore Roosevelt once said, “Don’t foul, don’t flinch—hit the line hard.”

This spring, a group of students (myself included) will be having a campus-wide “Bone Marrow Registry Drive.” During the weeks leading up to that point, this committee will educate the campus community (through articles in the Davidsonian and speeches around campus) and try to encourage enthusiastic participation among the students, whom we feel confident will recognize the importance of this worthwhile cause. We hope Davidson College can become the “model” for other academic institutions to follow. In this article, as well as in a future article, I will be telling my story with the hope that it will encourage many of you who read it to want to be registered as potential donors.

Part One: Why?

My senior year of high school was rolling along quite smoothly at good ol’ West Charlotte that winter of 1988. I had somehow finally finished my “early decision” application to Davidson. I was already mired in the dreaded “senior slump.” I was enjoying my last year of school with the typical zest and excitement that anyone would have. I was anxiously looking forward to my senior season of basketball, hoping that my summer of running and practicing would earn me something better than just another year of having that great front row seat on the bench. All the pieces of my life seemed to be falling neatly into place. Then, as they say, “the doo-doo hit the fan.” And, boy, when that doo-doo hit, it sure hit hard.

I had begun to gradually notice that the level of my play at basketball practice had dropped. I couldn’t get my outside shots to fall, I had difficulty getting up and down the court every time, and my rim-shattering dunks weren’t quite as rim-shattering. (Okay, so I’ve never had a rim-shattering dunk in my life, except in my dreams.) Anyway, I blamed my decreased intensity on my nagging leg pains. My mother guessed that I had an iron deficiency, so the afternoon before our first game at East Mecklenburg, I stopped by the doctor’s office for what I thought would be a “routine five-minute visit.” That visit would turn into a year-long saga.

The real nervous anxiety set in when my doctor repeated the blood tests for a third time. The look on his face when he entered the examining room was definitely one of “false confidence.” He sent me over to the hospital for further tests.

INSIDE

I am personally very committed to this effort because it was the life-saving bone marrow donation by my eight-year-old sister, Lee, that helped save my own life. The donation of bone marrow to those who so desperately need it offers the high potential and hope for a cure in an otherwise bleak scenario. Our national bone marrow registry can currently only provide “donor matches” for a small proportion of those who need one. With the assistance of the Red Cross and various sponsors, it is our wish that Davidson College can become the model for other academic institutions to follow.
