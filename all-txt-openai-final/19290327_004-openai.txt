DR. McCONNELL SPEAKS

Davidson Professor Attends Dinner of New York Alumni Association at Special Invitation of That Body

Richmond, New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore were the scenes of Davidson College Alumni meetings during the week of March
11-16, when over 50 percent of the former students located in those cities or adjacent territory came together to hear
about the Davidson of today and its immediate changes, and to think and talk Davidson informally. Eight of the states
along the east coast were represented, and men from thirty classes, extending from 1880 to 1930 attended. All of the
meetings showed an unusual amount of enthusiasm for Davidson, and indicated a keen interest in almost every phase of its
activity. The proceedings of each meeting follow:

Richmond

The first gathering of Davidson alumni was at Richmond on Monday, March 11th, when 29 men were present in the
dining hall of the Assembly Training School, where supper was served. The meeting was presided over by Rev. W. E.
Hill, D.D., 1900, president. After an election of officers, the alumni secretary was introduced, and told of the immediate happenings
at Davidson and some of the recent actions of the board of trustees. Rev. Walter L. Lingle, D.D., ’92, chairman
of the board of trustees, came in from Atlanta at the conclusion of the secretary’s remarks and was asked to
speak to that body. He recapitulated, to a certain extent, what the secretary had said, and added a number of
other thoughts on the recent meeting of the board. Dr. Hill and E. B. McGukin, ’22, also talked.

New York

At the New York meeting, Wednesday, March 13th, 44 alumni, representing the states of New York, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut met
at the Fraternity Club for a dinner-meeting. W. P. Anderson, president, presided, and when the old officers had been re-elected,
Mr. Anderson introduced Dr. J. M. McConnell, ’99, of the Davidson faculty, who had gone to New York at the
special invitation of the New York association. Dr. McConnell spoke upon “The Davidson of Tomorrow,” reviewing the early beginning of
the college, with its subsequent struggles. He told of the new era which began with Dr. Henry Louis Smith’s administration,
after which he discussed the future of Davidson. He cited the many advances which had been made during the past
few years, mentioned the more recent and outstanding actions of the board of trustees, and in closing predicted a future
for the college surpassing the hopes of its alumni, its faculty, and its administrative officers. Capt. Geo. H. Weems, now
stationed at West Point, spoke to the assembled alumni and personally extended them an invitation to attend the Army-Davidson game
at West Point next fall. He assured them of entertainment, and along with Capt. W. A. Dumas, ’15, also at
West Point, is going to see that alumni are provided with excellent tickets and that they enjoy the day. The
secretary also talked to the gathering.

Boston

Most of the 21 alumni attending the Boston meeting on Thursday, March 14, were students at Harvard, though two of
them came to Boston from Providence, R. I. Dinner was served at the Faculty Club at Harvard, and at the
conclusion of this the group adjourned to one of the club rooms where the secretary spoke informally. W. S. Woods,
’27, who had made the preliminary arrangements, presided. An open forum discussion followed, with almost every man asking questions about
the college. The questions of an enlarged Davidson library and the future of alumni work were discussed.

Philadelphia

Twenty-one men also attended the Philadelphia meeting at the Southern Tea Room, Friday, March 15, which was presided over by
J. P. Hendrix, '25, in charge of arrangements. He introduced the secretary who first asked for remarks from Dr. R.
E. Watkins, ’12, who had also been present at the New York meeting. In the discussion following the secretary's remarks,
the question of Davidson’s commencement being changed to a later date was mentioned, and a number of questions asked. No
organized association was attempted at this or the Boston meeting.

Baltimore

Dr. H. C. Davis, ’02, was host to 15 Davidson alumni with a buffet supper at the Baltimore Club, in
Baltimore, Saturday night, March 16th. A number of the men attending were newcomers to the city. After the re-election of
officers, the secretary talked, and his remarks were followed by a discussion of the future of Davidson in its relationship
to education. Most of the alumni contributed to the thoughts, for the majority were either connected directly or indirectly with
educational institutions or expected to be with colleges or universities. In the observations on this page will be found the
major points brought out in the deliberations.

Views and Observations

Whenever the alumni secretary attends a series of alumni meetings, he returns to Davidson with a bevy of thoughts, observations,
and ideas. In the following paragraphs he is giving expression to a number of them:

Davidson College alumni are thinking more about their Alma Mater and its future today than ever before. The fact that
Davidson is to have a new president next year is probably responsible for considerable of this thought, for he, in
a large measure, will determine the accomplishments of the college in the years to come. The rapid-fire questions propounded in
the open forum discussions in several of the meetings were constructively framed, and were not of idle consequence, but dealt
largely with the future contributions of Davidson to the educational world.

Exactly 129 former students of Davidson attended the five alumni meetings, representing over 50 percent of the men who had
access to the meetings. Alumni in eight different states had the opportunity to attend the gatherings, and all eight were
represented. The New York meeting was the largest, with 44 men present, excluding the two representatives from the college. One
alumnus remarked that it was a tribute to the college that so many men would come together to discuss its
future.York; Dr. Clewell Howell, Baltimore; Dr. Geo. M. Robson, Haddenfield, N. J. 1921—Dr. J. R. Boulware, New York; D. P.

What Constitutes A Call to the Ministry? ANSWER NO. 12 In China production stands highest in the list of employments.
Everywhere the producers are indispensable. But the sustenance of soul life is more important than the feeding or clothing of
the physical life. This is one employment of the minister. “Is not the life more than meat, and the body
than raiment”? Union Theological Seminary has helped many men to a happy and achieving life; perhaps, we could help you.
