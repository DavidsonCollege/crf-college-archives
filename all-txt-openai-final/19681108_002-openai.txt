**The Other Davidson**

Until we began our series on The Other Davidson, which ended last week, chances are good that many, if not
most, Davidson students didn’t know the place and its people existed. Undoubtedly, some still don’t. But regardless of whether or
not you read the series, The Other Davidson is very real, and it’s high time that fact was realized.

As the articles pointed out, Davidson is not a unified community. More than a railroad track separates its residents. Neither
side really understands the other, for numerous recent efforts notwithstanding, custom and personalities and history still dominate the whole relationship.
It hasn’t been a pretty picture. The black people here have been manipulated and misused in the past, and even
now the attitude of the white community is too often one of paternalism rather than genuine understanding.

This is not to say, however, that the town government and the college have not been trying to better a
bad situation. Recently they have been trying very diligently, in fact, and they have both effected a number of improvements.

The college employs most of the residents of The Other Davidson, and just in the last few years wages and
other benefits have gone up significantly, with a genuine promise of more to come. The housing situation in The Other
Davidson is generally wretched, but last September a housing project was begun which has led to the construction of 20
new homes so far. Employment has often been spotty, but the influx of several industries is helping. Segregation apparently lingers
now only in whites’ minds. And where there has been mistrust and misunderstanding between the two communities, a Mayor’s Committee
on Human Relations was established five years ago in an effort to investigate problems and air grievances.

But problems remain, mainly because too many people on this side still fail to understand completely what they are dealing
with across the tracks. Unfortunately, we don't have a ready solution either. More efforts are needed. For a start, we
need to recognize the situation like it is. We need to realize that gestures that make us feel good don’t
necessarily have the same effect on the black community. And we need to avoid a policy of benevolence and try
a little honesty and straightforwardness instead. Then maybe we'll be on the right track.

**The Senate**

Back in September we had a few words to say on the matter of attendance, or lack of it, at
Senate meetings. Recalling a long history of carelessness among student government representatives, most of our words weren't too complimentary, and
among other things we promised to print occasional attendance checks on this year’s Senate.

Our first report is elsewhere on this page, and it shows that the Senate is worthy of commendation. Except for
two members, attendance has been good. Just how accurate the figures are is a little doubtful. The Senate’s secretaries have
been notoriously sloppy at times, and attendance is not taken when there is no quorum, which happened a couple of
times last May. But, like we said, most of the senators have been there most of the time. It is
a welcome change and one that we are happy to report.

**Culture**

One of the hopeful signs about Davidson’s cultural future that has emerged this year is the expansion and improvement of
the Union’s Fine Films program. We are not doomed to a continued culturally rural existence if programs like this can
be successful.

However, season ticket sales indicated a less than enthusiastic response from the student body. Less than 165 tickets were sold,
and many of those were sold to faculty members. One reason is probably that artists’ films are something of a
specialized interest, but nevertheless flicks like “La Strada,” “Shoot the Piano Player,” and “Citizen Kane” are valuable even to the
untutored moviegoer.

The Fine Films program and the New Cinema demonstrate a desire on the part of the Union Board to risk
financial loss in order to expand cultural opportunities and provide students with an experience of a literate and artistic media
that would ordinarily be inaccessible. Jeff Duffey, Dr. Anthony Abbott, and their committee have acquired excellent films and all that
remains is for students to invest the time and energy to see them. Those who do will be rewarded.

**MSA Espoused**

Davidson's rather unique approach to its students has been widely praised, and rightly so. When the college admits a student,
it is with the idea that he will be graduated from here. And then Davidson goes to great lengths to
see that he does graduate. Rules are often bent and exceptions made, and consequently very few students are sent packing.
In short, Davidson looks after its own.

Therefore, the way the college deals with its married students is a little surprising and disappointing. It represents a departure
from the Davidson way of doing things. In compiling our feature page on married students here (see page three), we
used several reporters. They talked to a lot of people and did a little sleuthing, and despite the fact they
were working individually, their reports all said about the same thing: married students at Davidson have it pretty rough.

In any given year, married students make up from two to five percent of the student body. And by virtue
of the fact a student is married, he requires more than other students, particularly different housing. In this one respect,
the college does provide some accommodations—specifically, eight units—and over the years our married students, living here, there and yon, have
made do. But the situation could be a lot better.

It is regrettable that 13 of our current number of 21 married students have to live in non-college houses, and
it is even more regrettable that one of them—a student not given to that kind of thing—can charge, as he
does, that the college has been “indifferent” to married students and their problems. But he’s right, up to a point,
and steps need to be taken to help the married students. They have already done a lot for themselves. They
have gotten organized under the leadership of ex-Marine Phil Hazel and they have indicated they are willing to work.

Better housing they need most of all, and they feel if the college can just provide some land, the project
could be turned over to a private investor. Obviously, the students could guarantee him occupancy of at least 20 units
on a nine-month basis. President Spencer himself has suggested this approach, and it deserves further study. And in the meantime,
the married students say they need babysitters at a reasonable price, too.

**Coeds For Lehigh?**

From The Brown And White (Lehigh University)

Coeducation is finally getting attention at Lehigh. The Goals Committee recommended that an outside committee be brought to campus to
examine the feasibility of allowing skirts to roam on South Mountain. This action was not unexpected—it has happened at nearly
every all-male campus in the past few years. And it appears as though many such institutions are reaching similar conclusions:
coeducation is more desirable than an all-male environment.

Princeton has reported that the better high school seniors prefer coed schools. A Wesleyan University report pointed out that “if
male students are to mature as men they need both regular and natural contact with women, and some preserves of
maleness.”

The reasons for coeducation are many and have been put forth on these pages and by other interest groups on
campus. Benefits start with a more well-rounded extra-curricular activities program. The academic impact on the College of Arts and Science—a
weak point at Lehigh—cannot be overemphasized. And from the findings at Princeton, it appears as though for Lehigh to remain
among the nation’s better universities, coeducation is a necessity.

**LETTERS TO THE EDITOR**

**Howard Attacks Senate Analysis; Swann, Moore Criticize Errors**

To The Editor:

Franklin Anderson has a vivid imagination. His article of Oct. 25 could be dismissed as cynically amusing, but his exercise
in fantasy in the last DAVIDSONIAN (How the Senate Works: An Analysis, Nov. 1) crossed the thin line from the
amusing to the absurd.

In the article, Anderson divides the Senate into neat categories and tacks on labels which often are flung around loosely
in this political season. Surprised to find myself listed as a member of the “conservative coalition,” I asked Franklin how
he came by these amazing insights. “Well, as I remember, you voted against the diving rule."

The “dive rule” was a proposal considered on April 23 and 25 which would have required anyone who missed a
review for medical reasons to remain in the infirmary for 24 hours. Beyond the pros and cons of the plan,
it seems difficult to believe that opposition to an inflexible rule, which would place restrictions on a student and would
inject outside and artificial inducements into the Honor System, could be used as an indicator of conservatism. Amazingly, this unusual
logic seems to be the principal criterion.

Although in his article Anderson reports that “five vote consistently conservative,” he offered me no specific knowledge of my voting
record, and in fact the week before had written and even gloated over the fact that (How the Senate Works:
An Analysis, Oct. 25) “search of the Senate minutes reveals nary an account of who voted how on an issue.”
He also mentioned my comments in meetings and his consultation with the Senate reporter for THE DAVIDSONIAN as influencers in
his analysis. Franklin has been at few Senate meetings. The Senate reporter was asked not for information, but for an
assent after the classifications had already been made.

This letter is not intended to be a personal defense. I do not consider my conservative label as a condemnation,
but as a misrepresentation, as is the bulk of the article. I won't indulge in a point-by-point refutation of the
rest of the “analysis” because the remainder is merely an even more far-fetched elaboration on the same theme—the fabricated “conservative
coalition” thwarting the also non-existent “liberal establishment.”

I have noticed polity tendencies among the senators, though these leanings are hardly as precise as an eager reporter might
like. However, virtually unsubstantiated and highly opinionated “news” stories (with the admitted and seemingly sole purpose of provocation) can only
serve to alienate students and invalidate THE DAVIDSONIAN as an important communication link between the Senate and the student body.

To The Editor:

A number of things have proved disturbing to me about Davidson since I came here in September. The most recent
one is the treatment accorded to those students who were demonstrating in the Union for the alternatives to service in
the Marine Corps. Apart from ideology, the only observable differences in the two groups were the neatness of attire (leathernecks
win here) and the amount of material available at the displays (peaceniks win here). Both groups conducted themselves in a
quiet, orderly fashion. The student group, however, was told to leave the Union. The reason given for their expulsion was
that two groups may not recruit in the Union at the same time. Students may not recruit for peace while
the Marines are recruiting for war. I see in this move not so much an attempt to enforce a Union
regulation as an attempt to stifle a group which, left unchecked, might disfigure the image of Davidson College, produce storm
clouds in its blue skies, and upset the

Kenyon Goes Coed
By MELINDA KOESTER
In The Sweet Briar News

Kenyon College has done what many think Sweet Briar should do. Last week ground was broken for a coordinate college,
which as of now is nameless. Kenyon is a small private liberal arts men’s college in Gambier, Ohio. The school
believes that the answer to today's problem of the "small segregated college" is not to admit girls nor to improve
its present enrollment (750) but rather to construct a separate coordinate school for girls, with an enrollment of 600. More
than one faculty member and member of the administration have stated that this plan is the answer for Sweet Briar
(Fletcher College?) but that the main problem is a lack of funds. A cost of 15 million dollars has been
heard for Sweet Briar. Kenyon received its funds through a bond issue from the Ohio Hughes Educational Fund. This plan
shows a greater cooperation between privately sponsored colleges and the state government. But that's in Ohio. In the ground-breaking ceremonies,
the chancellor of the Ohio Board of Regents told the Kenyon community, "You don’t know what you've been missing!" Fletcher
College... hmm.

Conservatives, Liberals Fight It Out In Senate
By JOHN WILLIAMS
Associate Editor

President Joe Murphy leaned back in his chair and twirled his brown handlebar mustache. “About 20 percent of the student
body is living in intellectual poverty,” he said. An immediate controversy arose between the liberals and conservatives in the student
Senate as to how the poverty program could be financed. “Private contributions,” vowed the conservatives. “Larger SGA budget,” responded the
liberals. Then Sen. Rich Cowart (L-Davidson) arose to propose gun control legislation. “Violence is increasing in the student body at
a dangerous rate,” he maintained. When reminded that the Senate had already appointed a gunroom keeper, he sat back down.
Sen. Frank Murphy (L-Davidson) then got up and proposed a voting machine to make elections more realistic at Davidson. “Besides,
I'm getting tired of counting the damn ballots.” Although his seniority should have entitled him to special considerations, apparently he
was not on the right committees, for his proposal was defeated. Sen. John Passmore (C-Davidson) then arose to make a
speech favoring self-scheduled exams. Reminded that he was a conservative senator and should not favor such a move, he replied
bluntly, “I'm a liberal conservative.” Sen. Gary Cash (C-Davidson) stepped up to address the Senate concerning student recruiting of Negroes,
generally considered a liberal measure, which he has worked for. “I feel that I can do this and maintain my
conservative stance,” he said, “because I do not favor making the Negroes come to Davidson, just give them the opportunity.”
President Murphy then recommended to the Senate a name for appointment to the Court of Appeals. Immediately senator after senator
arose to object vigorously to the candidate and his qualifications. The speeches continued for six hours and the filibuster finally
broke up at 3 a.m. in wild disorder. At the end of the melee, a DAVIDSONIAN reporter managed to catch
Sen. Covey Carter (C-Davidson) for just a brief interview. “Sen. Carter, we have recently read conflicting stories in which you
were classified as both a moderate and a conservative? How can you explain this?” “Well,” Carter said, “you know the
press as well as I do.”

It is a widely accepted belief that colleges are not democratic institutions. Whether they are democratic or not, however, should
not inhibit the right, indeed the responsibility, of its students to present alternatives to killing.

To The Editor:

I would like to know why the dorms don’t have better phone service. Take last Monday as an example. In
four dorms only one phone was working. The rest, a call could be received but that doesn't do the students
any good. The only alternative was the pay phone in the Union and four times out of five that was
busy also with a waiting line. It's bad enough when a person (especially freshmen who have trouble with rides) can
see the opposite sex only on weekends but when you can’t even hear a sexy voice the rest of the
week, it is enough to make a guy lose his mind. Surely the administration must understand the basic male desire
for a little female companionship even if it is only over a telephone.

A Failure

The Omicron Delta Kappa tapping last week was a failure. True, some men who deserved the honor were recognized as
they should have been. And equally true, some were not recognized who should have been, and, by the same token,
some were recognized who should not have been. I have debated with myself for a long time on whether or
not to write this column, which by the nature of the subject is necessarily mud-slinging, and for that reason necessarily
offensive to some. I have chosen to say in print what should perhaps be said only in private for two
reasons: First, because by his required presence at the tapping ceremonies, each student gives tacit credence to the honorary purposes
of ODK. That there must be some peons around to do the honoring of those honored is implicit. Second, because
the tapping is done publicly, its failure should be cited publicly. What should be completely apparent to anyone who has
thought twice about the ODK tapping is this—the selection process currently in effect needs an overhaul. According to a member
of ODK, the selection process is governed rather strictly by guidelines set up by the national organization. The selection process
works like this. To be selected to membership, a student must be outstanding in only one of five areas of
leadership: scholarship, athletics, student government and religious and social life, publications, and dramatics, music and art. This student must be
in the top 35 percent of his class. (This requirement may be waived, however, if a local chapter unanimously elects
a student to membership, and then goes through the folderol of applying to national which normally meets only once a
year.) If the student meets the above qualifications, he must be voted into membership by a three-fourths vote of all
the student members of ODK meeting with a committee of four fratres in facultate who also vote. Apparently this system
is not working as it should. I find my credibility strained to believe that eight of the present 16 outstanding
leaders on campus as cited by ODK are members of one social fraternity. Of course, no matter how hard the
national ODK organization has tried to objectify the subjective, the subjective still plays some part, as it does in all
things, in the voting. The two major flaws, however, in the system, both nationally and at Davidson, seem to be
in the very definition of leadership. First, leadership has been equated with scholarship. This is the false assumption that if
a man is an outstanding scholar, yet has done nothing else on campus of outstanding merit, he is also a
leader. I have always thought that leadership had to do with leading men, not leading your class in grades and
smarts. So ODK recognizes the leaders in grade-grubbing, who are rather “automatic” members, I’m told. What happens to the man,
I wonder, who has achieved a sound academic record at Davidson, who has devoted his time and talents to leadership,
but who doesn’t quite have the grades to make ODK? In practice, if not theory, at best he must settle
for the little-publicized accolade of “Who’s Who,” and other than that, remain unsung. If observers of the Davidson scene know
little else, they at least know those who should have been honored and, unfortunately, weren't. Second, I find it reprehensible
that ODK members may be selected on the basis of leadership in activities for which they receive some sort of
monetary compensation, either as a cash payment or as a scholarship for services rendered. ROTC leadership and athletic prowess which
is paid service should not be a basis for ODK selection. I do affirm that these men’s leadership is a
very real and vital part of campus life. I also say that both ROTC and athletics have their own honors:
Scabbard and Blade and Distinguished Military Student awards for ROTC and lettermen, most valuable player, etc., awards for athletics. It
seems that if ODK, which is assumed to be the highest leadership honor not only at Davidson but across the
country, is to have any meaning or worth as an organization, it should reform its selection policies. After all, if
you can't do what you're supposed to, you shouldn't try to make people think you are. It’s time ODK bridged
the credibility gap.
