With the advent of spring, which was delayed for some time due to the usual Davidson monsoon holding sway, Coach
Storey’s proteges, between bursts, web-footed their way to innumerable touchdowns. Then a ray of sunshine shafted down to the storm
clouds silently earthward.

(With apologies to the Cat Tale reader, we present guest columnist HUGO SAPP).

Jim Jackson, the Davidsonian Cub Reporter, slunk over the border into South Carolina, accompanied by his brain trusters, the Sporting
Club, to cover the Carolina Cup Races for this rag. However, when asked for the article, Jackson gulped a bromo
and sneaked back to bed. This left the sports page in a predicament (the same one they have been in
since ‘41), stumped, and procured a pinch hitter to take the place of Jackson (Executive Officer of the Eagle Scouts
on campus). The editor brilliantly thought of writing on baseball, and the ghostwriter was bowled over. The Davidsonian policy of
writing about a sport in mid-season had never been violated before. The reason for this mid-season policy was so that
the sports reporter could echo the opinions of the Charlotte Observer Sports Section and thereby get laurels for his opinions.

Coach Jefferson’s Charges (has something to do with electronics, i.e., Negative and Positive) played host to Catawba on Thursday, April
4. The negative action of the coach's charges was rather noticeable in the sixth stanza when Red Catawba Stalwart drove
longer than Sammy Snead on the 18th tee in the Greensboro Open. The Catawba pitcher was in a quandary on
how to pitch to Kab-Yarborough, Davidson's diminutive left fielder. In sheer desperation, he rolled the ball on the terra firma.
Just before the ball reached home plate, it ground-looped, and the umpire called a strike, much to Yarbo’s consternation.

In an interview with Hal Mapes, Davidson Star Twirler, the reticent Mapes disclaimed the fact that nothing very interesting had
ever happened in his baseball career and recalled a game in which he had been partially instrumental in winning. Naturally,
Mapes, on the mound and a state championship is on the line. Mapes, the ambidextrous, retires the opposing team in
1-2-3 order. However, Mapes and Co. were equally unfortunate in boosting their batting averages. The game seesawed at 0-0 until
the last of the ninth when who should come to bat but our hero H. Mapes. He saunters up to
the box, taking a final hitch in his belt and bowing sociably to the stands. With two men out, the
count soon becomes 2-3, and on the loaded pitch, Mapes takes a powerful southpaw swing and connects fairly with the
ball. The spheroid soars high into the air as our hero sprints around the bases. Then, describing a perfect arc,
the ball comes down squarely on top of the fence. The ball splits in half, with one half staying in
the park while the other half fell over the fence. At this point, Mapes sat back in his chair with
his arms folded and a pleased gleam in his eye. Our inquiring reporter timidly asked, “Well, who won?” “We did,
ya dope, 1 to 0,” came the reply.

Coach Shephard, it is rumored, is writing a manual for batters that promises to be the book of the century
as far as baseball is concerned. The title, rumor has it, was “Your Hit Parade,” but due to technical difficulties
with the A.T. Co., it has been changed to “A Symposium of Swing.”

A track census will be taken among the student body to see if track is popular or if there just
isn’t any other place to take sun baths besides the stadium. Davidson's Ferris Wheel had hoped to bring you the
inside dope on Bill McLean’s election to President of the Student Body. Co-manager of the campaign, Steve Hanagan (Buddy) Carson,
was throwing a little post-election party at the Bamboo and couldn’t be reached. Co-Manager Jimmy Byrnes (Bill) Rogers was found
in the back of the Fraternity House mixing drinks (Pepsi and 7-Up) at another campaign celebration and was too hilarious
to make a statement.

and then—Editor).

THE DAVIDSONIAN

TENNIS TEAM TRIUMPHS THRICE
Wildcat Sports | TENNIS TEAM WINS THREE
CATAWBA HITS HOMER AS BALL SAILS OVER FENCE

Workmen begin and left exposed. The room will be furnished with gifts already received from friends. Everybody is taking an
interest in helping it along. One lady came from South Carolina bringing a magnolia which she planted. Another from West
Virginia is leaving a fund to pay for upkeep each year, and other gifts too numerous to mention. A kitchen,
porch, restrooms, and a large screened porch will complete the lodge. The hill slopes down from the porch to a
level spot where an outdoor fireplace is being built. Nearby is a large oak tree, and some little chairs and
tables. The Erwin country boys have built a dam, and the water for the lodge will be obtained from this.
It is to have electricity also. The lodge will fill several useful functions which have been lacking on the campus.
It will provide a place to hold fraternity dances, a place to have picnics even when it rains, and a
gathering place for almost any social event. And Mrs. Erwin added, “We want it to be a place where everyone
will have a good time, a happy place.” And it will be, too.

(Continued from Page 1)
About that time, the state of North Carolina gave long leaf pines to those who would use them to prevent
soil erosion. The pines were secured and were planted by the Davidson Boy Scouts, among whom was Phifer Erwin, the
older of the Erwin boys to give his life in the war. Now it is a beautiful spot having a
large grove of long leaf pines. The lodge walls are to be built entirely of native stone. The main room
will be twenty by forty feet, making it possible to have small dances. At one end of the room, there
is to be a large stone fireplace flanked by cabinets and tall back benches on each side. The piano will
be located at this end, leaving the remainder of the room for a dance floor. The large beams supporting the
roof will be stained.

’Cats Hold First Intercollegiate Track Test In Three Seasons
Introducing . . . By Mac Hart
Buck Archer andJerry Robinson and Buck Archer, both short, stocky, and friendly veterans, are the leading aces of our recently
organized tennis team, which has easily won its three matches as of April 8. Buck hails from Shelby, North Carolina.
He went to Darlington for a year before entering Davidson in the fall of '39. At Davidson, he played on
the tennis team and the football team as a fullback. Both of these teams won South championships.

Entering Davidson in '39, Buck played freshman football that year and varsity football the next two years. He also played
tennis for two years before entering service to become an infantry sergeant. Back in those days, Davidson had no tennis
coach, and the team coached itself. Buck feels lucky to have a coach this year, especially Coach Lufler. Buck is
a member of the Phi Delta Theta Fraternity, the Beaver Club, and is on the business staff of the Annual.
His hobby is stringing tennis rackets.

Jerry is from Wilmington, where he played tennis for three years at New Hanover High School. He entered Davidson in
the fall of '40 and played tennis here for two years before joining the army and becoming an infantry sergeant.
Even overseas with the Fifth Army, Jerry still played a lot of tennis. He won the championship in the 34th
Infantry tournament, both singles and doubles in the semi-finals, singles and doubles in the Fifth Army tournament, and doubles in
the semi-finals of the Mediterranean Theatre of Operations tournament. Jerry is in the "D" Club, the philanthropic literary society, and
Sigma Phi Epsilon Fraternity, where he will be on the Pan-Hellenic Council next year. Like Buck, Jerry thinks Coach Lufler
is "the best in the South."

**ROBINSON AND ARCHER**

Peters Only Returned Letterman On Track Team

For Davidson’s first intercollegiate track test in three years, Coach “Pete” Whittle will take a green but hopeful Wildcat squad
against the University of South Carolina in a dual meet in Columbia tomorrow afternoon. The last team fielded here was
in 1943 when the 'Cats went through their full schedule undefeated. This year's outfit, with one exception, is composed entirely
of men untried in varsity competition, but indications are promising for a victory over the Gamecocks, who bowed to the
powerful Duke Blue Devils 107½ - 22½ last week.

The only returning veteran is George Peters, co-captain of the 1943 team and a consistent point winner in pole vault,
high jump, and broad jump, who is rapidly rounding into his old form. Coach Whittle was not altogether pleased with
the showing his charges made in time trials last Saturday but believes they will improve considerably as they get into
stiff competition. Outstanding performances last week were Ward Lasley’s 10.2-second effort in the century, Bill Montgomery’s 23.8-second 220-yard dash, and
“Buck” Troutman’s six-foot leap in the high jump.

Those qualifying in the different events were: 100 yd dash—Lasley, Montgomery, Matthews; 220 yd dash—Lasley, Montgomery, Matthews; 440 yd dash—Fesperman,
Montgomery, Murray; 880 yd run—C. Cunningham, D. Hopper; Mile run—R. Harwood, R. Lowry, D. Hopper; 2 Mile run—J. Harwood, R.
Lowry, D. Hopper; High hurdles—Lacy, Peters, Troutman; Low hurdles—Lacy, Peters, Troutman; Pole vault—Peters, Poole; Broad jump—Lasley, Peters, Troutman; High jump—Troutman,
Peters, Robertson; Shot—McCullough, Strickland; Discus—McCullough, Strickland; Javelin—McCullough, Strickland.

**Walker, Archer, Hatch, And Robinson Perform Well**

Davidson's red-hot net team returned to the Wildcat campus Monday with three fresh victories in as many starts under their
belts. Leaving Davidson on Thursday, April 4, the Wildcats visited Erskine, South Carolina, and Clemson, leaving all three campuses smarting
under the blows of overwhelming defeat.

Arriving at Erskine on Thursday, the netters wasted no time in showing the boys from Due West who was boss,
dropping only seven games and losing only one match, that one coming through default. In the singles play, number one
man Buck Archer defeated Butts, 6-1, 6-0; Robinson defeated Calhoun 6-1, 6-1; Hately defeated Grier 6-1, 6-2; and Scott defeated
McGill 6-0, 6-1. Erskine failed to take a game in the doubles when Archer and Scott turned back Butts and
Calhoun 6-0, 6-0; and Hatch and Robinson took Grier and McGill 6-0, 6-0.

At South Carolina, Archer defeated Atkinson, 6-4, 6-2; Robinson defeated Chamberlain 6-0, 3-6, 6-2; Hatch defeated Baxter 7-5, 6-4; and
Scott defeated Todd 6-3, 5-7, 13-11. In the doubles bracket, Robinson and Hatch defeated Chipley and Atkinson 6-3, 6-2, and
U.S.C. won the second doubles match by default.

The Wildcats blanked Clemson's Tigers 7-0 on Saturday to complete the tour in perfect style. In the singles encounters, Archer
took Greyard 6-2, 6-2; Robinson defeated Wartham 6-0, 6-2; Hatch defeated Cartwright 6-2, 6-3; Scott defeated Watson 6-4, 6-3; and
Alexander defeated Thornhill 7-5, 6-3. In the doubles, Hatch and Wartham defeated Greyard and Cartwright 2-6, 6-3, 6-2; and Archer
and Scott defeated Cartwright and Watson 6-1, 6-1.

**AMONG THE GREEKS**

(Continued from Page 2)

The weekend ended with a good old pre-war function at the Charlotte Hotel on Saturday night. With Dr. Cunningham rendering
an excellent after-dinner speech (while our ice cream melted), the party got off to a fine start. Of course, he
was ably assisted by Master of Ceremonies, Lamar Williamson, who kept the party in a jovial mood with some of
his large repertoire of questionable jokes. The high point of the banquet was a surprise gift to "Magness." The "Sack-Lizard"
was exquisitely appropriate for the receiver. Always did need a bedpan, didn't you Byron?

Immediately upon the termination of the banquet, Fleet Green and his orchestra furnished the background for a fine dance. We
were all happy to have many of our old brothers back with us for the dance. Among these were: Bill
Ranson, D. D. Bryant, Joe Barnwell, Bob Smith, Tom McClintock, Dr. David Gales, and last but not least, Chalmers Phillips.
The dance ended at 12:00 P.M., and all departed quietly and very regretfully for home (I trust) in true Davidson
spirit.

In addition to his shot-putting, Paul McCullough has been named head manager. The complete 1946 schedule is as follows:
- April 13—South Carolina, at Columbia.
- April 20—Clemson, at Davidson.
- April 23—Furman, at Greenville.
- April 27—N.C. State, at Davidson.
- May 4—V.P.I., at Blacksburg.
- May 18—V.P.I., at Davidson.
