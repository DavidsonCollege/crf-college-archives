Slipping out the Roof-way

On a summer night we thought we were invisible.
A string tied to a finger pulled twice.
That was the code we used.
The roof, old asbestos, cracked under the slight combined one-hundred twenty odd pounds of you and me together.
More than once we came dangerously close to the edge, a twenty-foot drop.
But I was your older sister and you were my younger brother and we dared not be afraid.

Tonight, twenty years later, we slip in and out of heavy traffic.
It has been years since we have talked, me with two children and you between jobs.
Still, I am your older sister and you are my younger brother, and though we dare not be afraid, we feel the fear of things to come like the tug of the string.
The string that bound you and me, brother and sister, back on the roof-way, slipping out.
