Swimmers take on nation’s best at Nike Invitational

Men’s basketball is not the only squad to run into top ten competition early this season. Eighteen swimmers traveled to the Nike Cup Invitational in Chapel Hill on Wednesday, facing off against some of the nation’s elite programs.

“We went to a meet with NCAA level champions and high-powered Division I programs, and it was a great showing,” head coach Rich DeSelm said. “It was great competition, and a great pool. Our team had a chance to see the highest level of swimming in the country.

“I’m really proud of the group, to come away rewriting the season best times list and having a lot of people break into the all-time top ten. It’s really exciting to get faster swims before the last dual meet of the semester (against Georgia Southern and Eastern Carolina on Dec. 7 at Cannon pool).”

On the women’s side, North Carolina won with 1120.50 points, and Kentucky finished second (1037). According to DeSelm, Carolina should be a top ten team, and Kentucky should boast several All-American swimmers. The Wildcats finished tenth (40), beating William & Mary (16).

Mary Shell Brosche highlighted the women’s performance, setting school records in the 200 back (2:08.24, 17th) and 400 Individual Medley (4:34.38, 11th). She also grabbed 14th in the 200 IM (2:10.25), 23rd in the 100 back (1:02.21), swam the anchor for the 200 free relay (1:43.17, 16th) and 400 medley relay (4:09.00, 16th), led off the 800 free relay (8:02.87, 15th) and 400 free relay (3:43.85, 15th), and swam second on the 200 medley relay (1:55.30, 17th).

“I was really excited. I usually don’t swim fast unshaved and unrested, but this year I’ve done well,” Brosche said. “It could be better, but I’m happy with what I’m doing now, and I hope it will get better.”

Other top Wildcats were Kathleen Paffenroth and Zannah Bozzone. Paffenroth grabbed 16th in the 200 fly (2:11.36), 22nd in the 400 IM (4:41.10), 24th in the 500 free (5:14.23), and swam on the 400 medley and 800 free relay teams. Bozzone battled in the 500 free (5:14.21, 23rd), 200 back (2:15.30, 24th), 200 fly (2:15.58, 23rd), and the 400 medley, 200 medley, 800 free, and 200 free relay teams.

Tennessee won the men’s meet (977) with North Carolina taking second (835), and Davidson grabbed eleventh (5) avenging an early season loss to Virginia Tech (4). DeSelm said the Volunteers should vie for the national title, while both UNC and Florida (3rd place, 600) should be among the nation’s top ten or fifteen teams.

Freddy Schnell scored the only individual points for the Wildcats in the 200 back (1:56.25, 20th), and he swam the front leg of the 400 free relay (3:15.21, 15th). The Wildcats trailed Virginia Tech heading into that final relay, but Schnell, Dave Maddux, Scott Harper, and Keith Nelson vaulted Davidson over the Hokies.

“We didn’t even know we had beaten them (Virginia Tech) until after the meet was over,” Harper said. “That was cool, but it was not our main goal. We wanted to swim well and watch some great swimming, and we did that. It was a positive meet.”

Wrestling begins season at App. St.

While most freshmen this semester are feeling the rotund effects of “freshmen 15,” five new wrestlers are learning to combat the cheeseburgers and fries served by the Commons.

The five rookies and two others traveled to App. St. this weekend for a preseason tourney. “It’s probably one of the toughest tournaments we will go to this year,” said Coach Oddo.

Ian Campbell placed fourth out of 30 competitors in the 150-lb. division. Oddo also praised the efforts of Miles Cox and Stuart Frye, who both won matches in the tourney.

Coach Oddo is expecting big things from Ben Wall, Seth Herman, Andy Sterling, and captain George Escaravage.

“George is three times the wrestler he was last season,” said Coach Oddo, “As long as we stay healthy and avoid injury, we should do well.”
