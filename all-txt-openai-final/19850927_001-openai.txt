#### Personnel Shifts Fill Student’s Office

**By KELLY DIXON**

Anyone who has been in the Dean of Students office this year noticed some changes. Apart from the cosmetic differences,
two new assistant deans of students now inhabit the office. Paula Moore Miller and Harriette Root are familiar faces on
the Davidson College campus, Miller having served on a divided-time basis as assistant dean of students, and Root working in
the Career’s office as assistant director.

Becoming a full-time dean of students allows Miller the increased availability she desired. Serving in the admissions office, she was
often out of town when students needed her. Miller has recently moved to Davidson from Charlotte, a move she hopes
will enable her to be on hand for the frequent “after hours” activities of the Dean of Students office.

Harriette Root moved into her new admissions office in July. Counseling is a large part of her background. Apart from
her training from UNCC, she did quite a bit of counseling while working in the Career’s office. Relating her Career’s
office work to her new position, Root said most of her projects before dealt with off-campus interests, whereas this job
involves more immediate attention to on-campus problems. She also feels that Dean Terry has allowed the two new assistant deans
free reign to develop their positions as they see fit.

“There is a good, fluid, working relationship between the two (Root and Miller’s) offices,” Root says. “If a student sees
one of us one time and the other the next time, that’s no problem.”

And earth-shattering changes for DC or the dean’s office? Root says she will primarily act as “facilitator” for changes initiated
by students. Miller is involved in many on-campus activities.

#### Faculty Dean’s Resignation Effective In Spring

**By ANDREA DIEDRICH**

T.C. Price Zimmermann, Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean of the Faculty, submitted his resignation to President John Kuykendall
on Monday, September 23. He requested to be relieved of his current duties at the end of this school year.
Kuykendall accepted Zimmermann’s resignation on the same day.

In a memorandum to the faculty and administrative staff, Kuykendall said, “his intended retirement at the end of this academic
year from the Office of Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean of the Faculty is news which I can
accept only with the greatest reluctance.” In the same memorandum, Kuykendall requested that the Executive Committee of the Faculty serve
as a Search Committee for Zimmermann’s successor. He also requested that Professor Ben Klein, vice chairman pro tem of the
faculty, serve as Chairman of the search process. The Search Committee met for the first time on Wednesday, September 25.

In his letter to members of the faculty and administrative staff, Zimmermann, who is beginning his ninth year at his
current position, wrote, “Now I feel the time has come to return...”to teaching and scholarship.” Zimmermann plans to go on
sabbatical at the end of this school year and then return to Davidson the following year to teach history. “I
can’t imagine any group of students I would rather teach,” he said. In his letter, Zimmermann wrote, “I am looking
forward... to completing long-range scholarly projects laid aside at the time of assuming administrative office.” One of those projects is
to complete a book about a 16th-century Italian historian, he said.

Zimmermann emphasized in his letter his confidence in Kuykendall's presidency and the steady growth of Davidson “as a leader among
liberal arts colleges” as two reasons why he feels comfortable in submitting his resignation at this time. Zimmermann said he
has had offers from other institutions but has chosen to stay at Davidson. “I’ve invested a great deal of myself
in Davidson, and I am very attached to it,” he said. “My wife and I want to remain a part
of this community.” In his letter, Zimmermann also pledged “every assistance possible” to Kuykendall and to his successor.

When asked what qualities he hoped for in his successor, he said, “One always hopes one’s successor will be a
brilliant individual who will accomplish everything one hoped to do and didn’t.” According to Klein, the Search Committee plans to
begin advertising right away for Zimmermann’s successor. They plan to conduct a national search through The Chronicle of Higher Education.
At the meeting on Wednesday, the Committee laid out general plans for the search. They plan to process all received
applications with the strictest confidentiality, Klein said. This means they will not release the names of anyone who has applied
until they begin conducting interviews on campus. “When applicants do visit the campus, we hope to involve faculty, administration, and
students in the selection,” he said. They hope to be able to start interviewing by January.

The search committee did not make any specific criteria for Zimmermann’s successor according to Klein. “I think it would be
a serious mistake to get rigid guidelines,” he said. Klein felt that the only guideline that is likely to be
imposed is that whoever holds the position has their doctorate. Gender, race, and age should have no effect on the
selection, he said. The next official meeting of the Executive Committee is Wednesday, October 9, although Klein said it is
possible the Search Committee will meet before then. The Executive Committee is composed of members of the faculty who are
elected to three-year terms; Kuykendall, Zimmermann, and Dean of Students Will Terry.
