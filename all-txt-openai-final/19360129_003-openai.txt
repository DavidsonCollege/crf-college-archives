**THE DAVIDSONIAN, JANUARY 29, 1936**

**BROADCAST DONE DESPITE EXAM**

Pfohl, Babcock, Riker, Quartet And Trio Give Weekly Program Via WBT

**SCHOOL SONG IS BACK**

Time of Program Has Again Been Changed

Regardless of the excitement caused by the examinations, the regularly scheduled Davidson College program was broadcast from Chambers Auditorium, Friday night, January 17. The first number on the program was an Irish air rendered by Prof. James C. Pfohl at the organ. Following this, Warren Babcock played a cello selection accompanied by Mrs. Nelson Pfohl at the piano. Prof. Pfohl returned to the organ and played Schubert's "Ave Maria," accompanied by Louise Swan.

Immediately following this number, Mr. Franklin Riker, accompanied by Mrs. Pfohl, sang "Jeanie," the well-known song written by Stephen Foster. The campus news was then read by Announcer Grier Martin, and Prof. Pfohl concluded the program by playing "Love's Old Sweet Song," a reverent Silesian folk tune, and "Fairest Lord Jesus."

In opening the January 24 broadcast, the Davidson College program was again permitted to usher in the well-known Davidson College song. The program on Friday, January 24, was sung by the Davidson College Quartette, composed of John Allen, Paul Hudson, Charles Ramseur, and Don Whe. The trio, consisting of Warren Babcock (cello), Donald Pfohl (flute), and Prof. James C. Pfohl (piano), played the "Celebrated Minuet" by Va. This was followed by the quartette singing the old favorite, "Darling Nelly Gray."

The campus news, this time, informed the radio audience of a change in the Davidson College broadcast. In the future, there will be one program on Wednesday from 7:00 to 7:15 and another on Friday from 10:15 to 10:30. Returning to the musical part of the program, the quartette sang the popular Scotch air "Comin' Through the Rye." The trio then rendered a Russian Lullaby and a Polish dance tune, both by the composer Zamecnik. The quartette concluded the program by singing the beautiful old hymn, "Faith of Our Fathers."

**Tea Set From Japan Shown**

The latest library exhibit turns to the subject of Japanese china and includes a Japanese Lacquer Tea Set. The set includes a Japanese cake tray, a ceremonial tea set, one cake box, one cake service, and five individual cake trays. The pieces are black with red trimmings and a silver and yellow leaf design. The ceremonial set refers back to the Japanese tea ceremony, with an explanation shown in the exhibit encyclopedia. The china includes several tea cups without handles, white in color. The Japanese take about half an hour to drink from these cups. Other parts of the set include a hot water pot, tea pot, and a bowl for unused tea. Explanations of the ceremonies used are shown in the case.

Another odd exhibition is a beautiful, antique, silver-colored cigarette case given by King Edward VII to William J. Florence (1831-1891). He was an American actor of Irish descent and uncle of Mrs. Seifert, who exhibited it.

"Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?"and nothing but the truth? Sit down.” With these words The Court opened a trial at the fire-police station in Mis. Rogers. George, you would kill GAKe if I told the truth? She was sick. George for the trial which was to be a step toward making safe the property of this community’s student population. The defendant was a young and very drunk negro, whom we will call “Frog” for convenience. The long arm of the law had reached across the railroad tracks to “nigger town” and brought him in for the theft of a student's overcoat, missed after it had been left at a boarding house that noon.

George knew nothing of the coat which was allegedly bought in Con. The Court refused to convict us. The Court’s table; the coat lay on a chair nearby; the third witness sat near the prisoner; your reporter lurked nearby. The Court’s “stand” was his. “Frog” was there. “Mr. Blaine, tell this court what you know of this case.” (All names used are fictitious.)

“Well, I left my coat at the boarding house this afternoon after lunch, and when I went down tonight I couldn’t find it. Mrs. Rogers (she runs the boarding house) told me she had heard from George here, who works there, that “Frog” had the coat. I asked him why he had it, and he said it was his’n, so I told her about it. She said she had seen “Frog” with a coat like mine, but he hadn’t come back so I came down here and got the cop. We had just got across the tracks when we met George with the coat. We took him with us and went on back to the boarding house.
