Thursday, August 20, awards were presented to many employees of the College in recognition of their faithful and tireless service
to Davidson. Ike McCorkle was top man on the totem pole for 36 years as a member of the Davidson
family. Awards were given to those with 1 year of service to 30 years of service. Special awards were presented
by Mr. D. Grier Martin, who stated that the purpose of this awards day was: (1) Rewards for service and
an indication of the warm regard the college has for each member of its family, (2) coming together to consider
last year's work and that which is to come. Special awards were made to Dr. Cunningham, 10 years of service;
Mr. W. Sie McGill and Prof. Oscar Thies, 30 years; Mr. Hobart, 25 years; Mrs. Little, 5 years.

After the awards were made by Mr. Hobart, Mr. Murphy, and Mr. Stack to their respective departments, Dr. Cunningham thanked
all of the employees for their services to the college. He indicated the share which the employees had in the
education of the students. The president spoke of the obligation each man has to give his best, with each pulling
his share of the load. The appreciation of their lives was not only held by the administration but also by
faculty, parents, and students. It is hoped that this event will become a tradition of the Davidson campus.

Dr. Walter Lingle, President Emeritus, is in a Charlotte hospital for treatment.

Prof. A. G. Griffin has returned home following an operation and is reported to be making excellent progress.
