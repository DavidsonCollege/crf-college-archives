**Sleeper album deserves second glance**

By LEE EICHELBERGER

Kate Bush has been making records in the U.K. for years now and her popularity there has only increased, while
here in the U.S. she has never reached more than a select audience. This situation might change with her new
album *Hounds of Love*. The self-produced album, more than three years in the making, is a rich collage of aural
styles and textures that invites repeated listening.

*Hounds of Love* works as a complete album rather than a collection of songs, as each track progressively reveals another
layer of Bush’s psyche. In the record’s opener, “Running up that Hill (A Deal With God),” Bush croons, “It doesn’t
hurt me / Do you want to feel how it feels?” as she seems to invite the listener into the
depths of her dream-like self-perception. Thus begins this intriguing journey into Bush’s mind where she shows herself as a child,
“afraid of what might be” and as a woman who asks, “c’mon let me live.”

But it is not the lyrics which distinguish this record, rather it is the overwhelming aural power that Bush creates
instrumentally and vocally. Even lyrics that, by themselves, would appear trite, “You're like my yo-yo / That glowed in the
dark,” are overcome when a song’s sound and arrangement transcend them. The music’s power comes from its texture and obvious
craft; it oozes with a sensuality that ears cannot deny. It is based on a combination of keyboard and rhythm
arrangements, but Bush invigorates this formula by adding unusual musical elements. From the traditional Irish arrangements that flavor “Jig of
Life” to the Gregorian choruses of “Hello Earth,” this sound is completely original. It is dreamy without being disengaging. Bush’s
greatest instrument, though, is her own voice which permeates each track and adds that emotional “umph” that her lyrics lack.

If Bush borrows any musical techniques, they are the rhythms, which resemble recent Peter Gabriel, and an emphasis on sound
effects which is very similar to Pink Floyd. But Bush’s music doesn’t alienate the listener in the way that Gabriel’s
or Floyd’s does. In fact, the familiarity that her melodies and silky voice evoke is frightening. Ultimately, Bush's style is
just as indefinable as the styles of Peter Gabriel or Pink Floyd, yet much more accessible.

In the final evaluation, though, the music on *Hounds of Love* is beautiful and powerful, it is not matched by
the murky lyrics. For Bush does not communicate lyrically the passion that her music directly implies. This is not to
say that she cannot, since “Under Ice” and “Jig of Life,” prove that she can combine musical and lyric passion
successfully. Nonetheless, the sheer aural impact of the album is astonishing. And for this reason, the absence of hard-hitting lyrics
is hardly noticeable as the listener is swept away in an aural ocean of creamy melodies and cradled by Bush’s
vocals. Musically this album is flawless, but it fails to be a great record since it is grounded by underdeveloped
lyrics.
