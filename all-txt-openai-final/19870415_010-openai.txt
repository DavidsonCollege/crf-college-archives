A Different Shape of Shade

Traversing the tundra
shakes foundations,
increases the craving for shade.
The blandscape
distorts old perspectives.
The sense of distance bends.
The eye misses the drifts
and the diaperies of snow.
A small mound a hundred yards before
becomes a mountain.
In this place,
the Eskimo sees a sensible world,
sees forty different kinds of snow,
and finds shade in the crevasses
of human fortitude.

Moving to new places
one finds other tundras.
Here in the South,
I reckon I face one of them.
I arrive with no sense of climate,
with little sense of distance,
with faith that in the brightness
that surrounds a stranger
there will be avenues of shade.
I arrive with little and dangerous knowledge
of the natives.
I try to shorten distances
with long-striding lines,
but soft people turn to wood.
I try to shorten sentences
to imply, to entice.
I suggest there are stories
about Seattle, about its forty rains,
its mountains eternal on a clear day.
There is a salmon story
on my dining table
perched for cutting with wit.
I reel in no interest.
There is an absence of shade.
I discover
that gentle gardening is the rule
in the cultivation of words.
Here, one must know the seasons well
before the planting of topical gardens,
before the offering of verbal tease;
must know the slant of the sun
to prune a suited shape of shade.
On the tundra,
the skin adapts to the climate,
growing a layer of fat
to keep the heart warm.
Here, in this new place
where people abound,
one needs the solitude
a tree has in a forest:
with a new sense of distance,
one has to grow a different kind of skin,
a bark suited to the weather
and a different shape of shade.
How long I wonder,
must roots go
to sprout that different shape.

A story from the center of the earth

I. There was a time when
we talked cleverly about
the books of the Bible, when
we were quick off
the Karl Marx brew, when
we sat on pain by making all pain
words without flesh.
This was the time of
sleepwalking. Until Soweto,
until the African child.
One June day,
far away on the Cape of Good Hope,
children were reborn
in the middle of a school day
at the center of the schoolyard.
They said they had rights.
On that day,
the messengers of the Great White Hope
arrived.
Legions with their lineage stretching
into the tunnel of history,
coated with its debris,
armed with white hatred,
guns to their hearts,
symbols of faith.
But the new faith did not cease.
The messengers used their guns.
Bullets prodding children back to sleep. One slipped away.
The newspaper, from a disassociated press,
carried the picture.
Mother and Child.
Words became flesh.
I heard the scream that circled the globe.

II. This scream shall wring your neck, dislocate your apathy,
pierce drums;
suck your eyes off set orbits
to converge on this
hopping rag of edges;
knock your loveless teeth, tear you, sear you,
your devious throats of reason
caving and caving and caving.

III. Soweto is where the winds began.
It is where the earth rises now.
One day a quiet place for flowers.

BIRD OF PREY

Bird of prey
Drifting beneath the blaze above
With wings extended,
Glistening,
Forming shadows on things below...
Things not of air but of smoke.
She wipes his forehead,
He feels the air.
Tired, so tired.
They sleep, they sleep, so tired...
Dreams so slick and cool...
She appears in grace,
Creature, succubus, climbs the thorn,
Punctures the dripping flesh,
Devours the free-born spirit—
Catalyzing death...
Freedom bonded on chains on rocky cliffs where
The blaze shines in solar streams—
He wakes in chilling sweat, liver intact.
He wipes his own brow.
He goes to build, to build and build.
