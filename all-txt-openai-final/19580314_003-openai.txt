FRIDAY, MARCH 14, 1958

ALL STARS

The Kappa Sigma basketball team, fresh from running through the rugged interfraternity hardwood gauntlet unscathed, will take the floor next Wednesday night at 8 o'clock in an attempt to preserve its spotless record and a 12-game winning streak against an all-star team chosen from the other squads.

The all-star squad will be composed of the top ten players in the league, other than Kappa Sigs, as selected by the interfraternity players themselves. The player-chosen all-I-F team is named below. Sigma Nu Charlie Davis and KA Bill Ferguson, who have averaged over 24 points per game, will head a prolific all-star squad, which will put on the floor a starting five which has averaged 89.7 points per game this season. Other members of the starting five will be Freddy Lane, Beta, who is named honorary captain of the dream team by virtue of receiving the greatest number of player votes; Don Killian, Sigma Chi; and Dave Bradford, SAE.

The second five, also determined by the number of votes received, are Fred Streetman, K.A.; Ben Harris, Phi Delt; Angus McBryde, Phi Delt; Ralph Bright, SAE; and Bobby Thompson, Phi Gam. Semi Mintz, varsity scoring leader, will coach the all-star squad.

To combat the star-studded opposition, the Kappa Sigs will be able to start a team including five players mentioned on the all-star team, and two of the league’s top fifteen scorers. With an enviable perfect record during the season tucked under their belts, the Kappa Sigs, the first I-F team to finish undefeated since the Sigma Chis turned the trick in 1951, will be out to capture another headpiece for the trophy room. A game featuring the best of the intramural ball players warrants a good turnout for what should be one of the highlights of the I-F sports year.

THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE I WAS ABOUT TO MENTION... THE NEW CRUSH-PROOF BOX, TOO!

THE DAVIDSONIAN

By JIM HAMILTON
Davidsonian Sports Writer

The balmy breezes of March were followed by another sure sign of spring last week, as the crack of bats and the spat of horsehide hitting leather signaled the beginning of baseball practice. Davidson opens its 1958 schedule next Wednesday at Hickory, against Lenoir Rhyne. Two days later the Bears will return the visit and engage the Wildcats on the local field. Davidson took two games from Lenoir Rhyne last year.

MORE EXPERIENCE

Davidson's starting nine next Wednesday will feature more experience than last year’s team.

The Kappa Sigs, after a hectic race with many upsets and surprises, have won the inter-fraternity basketball tournament with a perfect record of twelve wins and no losses. On Tuesday, the Kappa Sigs, after a close first half, emerged victorious over the fighting Sigma Chi team by a score of 60 to 39. Ken Owen's rebounds and shots under the board proved to be too much for the Sigs, although Don Killian played a very good game for the losers.

Westervelt, Fagg Pace Wrestlers

By BILL HELLIER
Davidsonian Sports Writer

Boasting the best season record in 23 years, Davidson’s wrestling team completed their regular schedule of matches at the Southern Conference last weekend. Led by “Westy” Westervelt and Dave Fagg, Coach Charlie Parker's matmen compiled a fine 5-3 record. However, they were able to gain only a fifth place tie with Washington and Lee at the conference meet.

Westervelt finished his second unbeaten season by taking a first place in the 157-pound class at the conference and now has an amazing 24 straight wins to his credit. Coach Parker had only high praise for this outstanding performance and feels that “Westy” has an excellent chance of being the first Davidson wrestler to finish three unbeaten seasons.

At the conference, Fagg and Westervelt were the only Wildcat matmen to score. Fagg beat Johnston of West Virginia and Pledger of The Citadel to take third place in the heavyweight class, while Westervelt downed James Crowgey of Virginia Tech for first in the 157-pound class.

Although Fagg is one of the three graduating seniors on the squad, Coach Parker is expecting an even better team next year due to the return of the majority of his lettermen, and the marked improvement of freshmen McIntyre and Allen.

MEANWHILE, A FEW MILES

At first base will be big George Hart, last year's leading home run hitter. Second base will be manned either by Richmond (Rat) Rucker, who saw some action last year, or freshman Russ Cotton, who has looked good in practice. Don Killian, a good hitter and probably the best fielder on the team, will be at short, with either John Patterson or Dab...Good chance for a second place tie with the K.A.s. Ney Stuart handling the hot corner. The Pi Kapps, however, spoiled this chance when they downed the Delts 50 to 44 on Wednesday night. Harris’ efforts were not enough to stop the Pi Kapps who, led by Nash, played a brilliant ball game right down to the final whistle. Then, the K.A.s, led by Ferguson, rolled over the S.P.E.s with a score of 102 to 43. Russell Ferrell rolled up 23 points for the S.P.E.s, but he could not stop the K.A. onslaught.

On the same night, the S.A.E.s took a close one from the Betas, defeating them 35 to 33, with Ralph Bright leading the victors and Freddy Lane standing out for the Betas.

Out in the pasture, coach Tom Stevens plans to use either Bob Groome or Dee Green in left. Shelbourne Wallace, last year's batting champ and this year’s captain, in center, and either C. Swaim or Dave Page in right.

THREE PITCHERS

Stevens plans to use three pitchers, letting each work three innings. Allen Moore may start on the mound, and Green and Page will probably be called in from the outfield to work a few innings apiece. Harold Reagan will start at catcher. With more experience than last year, Stevens hopes to improve last year's 6-16 record. “But,” he said, “it will depend on our pitching.” Stevens singled out several players for particular praise. “Hart has been hitting well,” he said, “and Killian has looked good in the field. Also, this boy Swaim, who is back after being in the service, looks promising.”

Rifle Team Travels To Conference Meet

Tomorrow the Davidson College rifle team closes out its 1958 season, participating in the Southern Conference tourney at VMI, in Lexington, Virginia. Firing for the Wildcats will be Dick Wilson, Joe Wearn, Jerry Gattis, Stan Gaines, Jack Lohman, and Don Harper. Clemson dealt the ‘Cats a defeat on the local range last Saturday, downing them 1390-1353. Dye of Clemson was high for the match with a 285 score. Dick Wilson headed the Davidson firers with a 282, the highest individual tally of the year. The team score of 1353 was also high for the year.

Warden, Kiser Lead I-F Track Win for Kappa Sigs

By HENRY RAMSEY
I-F Sports Writer

The Kappa Sigs racked up a total of 38.25 points in the inter-fraternity track meet on Wednesday to take first place, as Dave Warden and Ed Kiser placed in first in most events. Two of the Kappa Sigs’ big men, Warden and Biggers, took first and second places in the shot put event with Warden's throw of 47' 10.2" leading the way.

Kiser took only 10.65 seconds to cross the tape in the 100-yard dash with Price close behind him, giving the Kappa Sigs another first and second place event. The Kappa Sigs took another first when Kiser broke the tape in the 220-yard dash in 24 seconds. Ed Lewis, A.T.O., took second place in this event.

In the 660-yard dash, Ward McKeithen, a Beta, led the field and finished with a time of 1 minute 36.5 seconds with Quantz, Kappa Sig, finishing second. The Sigma Chis put an end to the Kappa Sig stranglehold, however, when Cole led Ferguson, K.A., across the finish line in the mile run with a time of 3:38.3.

The Kappa Sigs took the relay in 1 minute 40.9 seconds while the S.A.E. team came in second, to wind up the meet. Then, Jimmy Hambright, Pi Kapp, took the low hurdle event in 14.55 seconds with Tommy Price, Kappa Sig, taking second place honors. Warden's discus throw of 125 feet and 9.5 inches gave him another first in the meet, while the Beta's Carter took second place. Bownes and Burke, both Sigma Chis, tied for first and second with jumps of 5 feet and 6 inches. The Phi Gams broke into the win column next when Alexander ran the 440-yard dash in 55.7 seconds with Davis, a Beta, close behind him.

Golf Turnout Boasts Experience, Talent

With at least five veterans back in the fold, coach Tom Scott looks forward to the 1958 golf season in anticipation of a good year. The number one club on the links, however, will probably be carried by newcomer Verner Stanley, former Myers Park of Charlotte ace. Stanley was rated one of the state's top junior golfers, and Scott feels the freshman can “stick with the best of them.”

Heading the returnees are two sophomores, two juniors, and a senior. Gary Heeseman, Sam Sloan, Sut Alexander, Bucky Dennis, and Ned Payne are the pre-season favorites to fill out the line-up. Seniors Johnny Mackorell and Chuck Feezor should be pushing for posts in the squad.
