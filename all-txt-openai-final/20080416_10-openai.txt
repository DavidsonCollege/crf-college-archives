THE DAVIDSONIAN

Meet time and time again to join in the speakers’ applause for the many people who deserve it. Director of
Athletics Jim Murphy took the podium to begin the congratulatory speeches, claiming that the “Real winner of this year” should
retire now. Both Woods and Ross are new to their positions and certainly rode a high wave of success.

He said the team “displayed an imaginably high” level of performance.

Men’s tennis slips before SoCon

By MIKE FRONGELLO
Sports Editor

Scott Myers ’09 completed a perfect 9-0 season in Southern Conference singles play with a pair of victories at No.
6, but Davidson dropped their regular season finales against Appalachian State and nationally ranked Furman over the weekend. On Friday,
the ’Cats fell to the Mountaineers 4-3 and on Saturday dropped their final home match of the year to SoCon
regular season champion Furman 5-2.

Scott Myers ’09 completed a perfect 9-0 season in SoCon play after defeating Furman’s Sawyer Duncan in singles.

In Friday’s match at Appalachian State, the Wildcats suffered a string of close losses in doubles play. The doubles teams,
consisting of Ethan Jaffee ’09 and Flaviu Simihaian ’08, Phillip Compeau ’08 and Eric Noble ’10, as well as Sam
Burns ’10 and Walker Lyons ’11, lost 9-7, 9-7, and 9-8 in their respective matches.

After dropping the doubles point, the ’Cats made up that point in singles play. Simihaian, Burns, and Myers all recorded
singles wins, but the Mountaineers were able to withstand the Wildcats' rally and secured the 4-3 conference victory.

Saturday’s match provided a stern test for the ’Cats as they hosted SoCon leader Furman, who came into the match
with a perfect 8-0 conference record and a No. 69 national ranking. The Paladins proved to be as good as
advertised as they swept the doubles point before notching the 5-2 victory with four singles victories. Lyons and Myers scored
the lone singles wins for the Wildcats.

Prior to the match, Compeau and Simihaian were honored as part of Senior Day festivities at Covington Tennis Courts. The
season-ending loss left Davidson with a final season record of 14-7 and 5-4 in Southern Conference play.

The ’Cats earned the No. 5 seed in this weekend’s SoCon men’s tennis championship and will get a shot at
redeeming Friday’s loss when they take on fourth-seeded Appalachian State on Friday afternoon. The tournament runs April 17-20 and will
be played at the Earle Tennis Center at The Citadel & Farmfield Tennis Center in Charleston, S.C.

The Davidson women’s lacrosse team traveled to Ohio for two on-the-road games last week. The ’Cats first challenged the Cincinnati
Bearcats on Friday and picked up an 11-5 win for their sixth straight victory to set the school record for
most wins in a season, but on Sunday the team fell to the Ohio State Buckeyes, losing 15-5. The Wildcats'
record now sits at 10-4 overall.

The leading scorer on Friday for Davidson was Becky Horton ’09, who whipped in six goals to bring her season
total to 27. Emily Diefendorf ’08 snagged two more scores for the team against Cincinnati. Single goals were scored by
Kate McDonald ’08, Jen Crawford ’10, and Haley Cook ’10.

The ’Cats outshot the Bearcats 37-18 during the game. They also outhustled the competition, snatching 41 groundballs in the contest.

On the defensive side of the Davidson lineup, goalie Laura Johnson ’08 played the entire 60 minutes of action, holding
the opponents to only five goals to secure the win.

A short two days later, the ’Cats were back on the field in Columbus to face a solid Buckeye squad.
Cook scored two goals while Sarah Walter ’08 and Emily Palmer ’08 each scored one. Horton was held to a
single goal, bringing her team-leading goal total to 28.

Johnson again anchored the Wildcat defense with 13 saves. Unfortunately, the high-powered Buckeyes improved to 8-6 on the season.
