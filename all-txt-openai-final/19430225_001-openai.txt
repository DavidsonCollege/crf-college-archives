Concert Pianists

Mario Braggiotti and Jacques Fray, concert pianists, appeared in Chambers on February 19th, at 8:15 p.m. The program was as follows: Fantasy and Fugue in G Minor by Bach; "Liebestod" by Wagner; Coronation Scene from Boris Godunoff by Moussorgsky; La Cathedrale Engloutie and L'Isle Joyeuse by Debussy; Pavane Pour Une Infante Defunte and Bolero by Ravel; Rhapsody in Blue by Gershwin; and variations on the theme of Yankee Doodle by Mario Braggiotti.

Mario Braggiotti was born in Florence, Italy of American parents, while Jacques Fray is a Parisian by birth. These pianists met while studying in the French Conservatory and have since become interpreters of Gershwin's music and helped him on their way to success on the stage. Fray and Braggiotti are always popular because they do not restrict themselves to the existing two piano library. As a result, they have enough variety to keep their programs lively.

Amateurs Show Talent

Even though rank amateurs, East residents showed up excellently as furniture movers and the marked movement of students from Georgia East causes great turmoil over the weekend.

By this time we are firmly convinced that the exodus of the boys from East makes the flight of the Children of Israel look like a parlor chess game. Hitler's "dauntless" legions may have caused anguish and suffering among the oppressed people of Europe but there has never been, we are inclined to think, a more concentrated solution of blood, sweat, and tears than the brine which was exuded on this campus the past week.

Although merely a case of war deprivation, the situation which upset the domestic tranquility of some 125 students caused a scene which we believe further evidence of Davidson's increasing self-reliance.

Attending Decatur Boys High, Manget attained high honors in his college preparatory work. He was president of the Senior class and had a regular place on both the baseball and basketball teams of his high school. Having continued his activities in sports here at Davidson, Ed has participated in all intramural sports thus far.

However, their life at Davidson will be mostly of mental and physical training.
