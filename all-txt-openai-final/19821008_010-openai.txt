**Booze Brothers, Number 3: The Meeting Place**

After last weekend’s senseless massacre of billions of brain cells at the Fiji party (we were there, brothers), the BB decided it best to give our heads a rest and expand our format to include restaurant reviews. This idea proved to be a good one as we hopped on the magic motorcycle and found ourselves at a gem of an alternative dining establishment. The Meeting Place (located at 259 S. Broad Street in “downtown” Mooresville) is perhaps the most unique restaurant in the Mooresville-Davidson-Cornelius-Huntersville-Concord pentagram. Set in a house built in 1892 by a mysterious Dr. Young, The Meeting Place provides a relaxed Victorian atmosphere with inside as well as outside porch dining and offers a predictable yet comprehensive dinner menu which includes seven beef entrees ($9-$14), five poultry entrees ($8-$11) and five seafood entrees ($7-$13). Each main course is served with a well-decorated salad (house dressing is creamy sesame seed), a hot loaf of bread with whipped butter and cheddar cheese spread and a choice of baked potato, home fries, or french fries (not frozen). The lunch menu includes salads, sandwiches, hamburgers and daily specials, such as free coffee or tea and dessert with a luncheon purchase of $3.25 or more (the usual lunch goes for four or five dollars). Soups, appetizers and a full range of homemade cakes and pies are available on both menus.

The Meeting Place impressed us with its authenticity. Instead of relying on cheap fads to draw a crowd (ringing bells, readable place settings, or loud and obnoxious waiters who won’t leave you alone), The Meeting Place offers mellow entertainment and a fully stocked bar. Melvin Shoemake picked and sang some soothing and unamplified country blues and this made the scene perfect. Customers weren’t expected to applaud after every song; instead, the music was just a part of the easy, make-your-own-fun-and-conversation atmosphere.

The Meeting Place has a full wine list which includes domestic and imported Reds, Whites, and Roses ($6.25-$13.25 per bottle), champagnes, and features Inglenook as the house wine ($5.00 a carafe). Draft beer (Bud and Miller Light) goes for 85¢ a glass, $2.75 for a small pitcher and $3.75 for a large pitcher. The bar also has a full range of bottled domestic and imported beer ($1.00-$1.75). No liquor is sold at The Meeting Place but brown bagging is fine with set-ups costing 75¢ a glass or $5.00 for a carafe.

The Meeting Place is open for lunch Tuesdays through Fridays from 11:30-2:00 and for dinner Tuesdays through Saturdays from 5:30 to 10:00. Any inquiries are directed to Mike at 663-0413.

Granted, this place is a bit expensive for the average college budget, but for a once in a while alternative to the usual garbage food you probably eat, The Meeting Place awaits your business.
