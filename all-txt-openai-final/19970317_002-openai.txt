The Residence Life Office, which plans to spend nearly one million dollars this summer in residence facility improvements, will soon purchase new furniture for several dorms.

SGA approves Reach Out and Crew allocations

The SGA approved a $1,490 computer for the Reach Out community service organization and $1,000 for the Crew Club Team. Reach Out needed the computer for publicity and database keeping. They bought it through the school computer services department to support a school business and for a good technical assistance package even though it was more expensive than purchasing it elsewhere. The Crew team stated it needed money to buy new equipment to meet the growing popularity and interest of the sport.

Priority Poll set to start

The SGA approved a final version of their priorities poll with which they hope to better gauge student concerns and interests to help set next year’s agenda. The poll will be administered personally by senators who will take the poll to their constituents.

Martin Court F still has room

By ANDREW PRESTON
Staff Writer

For the first time since its construction, Martin Court F did not reach its full capacity during the first phase of senior apartment selections. The Residence Life Office usually expects that there will be too many applications for the rooms, so this problem was a surprise. Residence Life Director Kurt Holmes stated that one reason for the problem may be that Building F has a reputation for filling up quickly, and it is a five-person apartment, whereas most other apartments are only for four people. “Some students are afraid to apply for it because if they aren’t selected they will have to move to a four-person apartment, and thatmeans that they will have to make the difficult decision of which person to drop,” says Holmes. Despite the fact that Building F did not fill up in the first phase, Holmes feels that there is “no real cause for concern. There are only two apartments that were not selected. It’s not like half of the apartment is empty.” Holmes expects that the two apartments will fill up when “we introduce the Junior class in the second phase. We have plenty of applications.” Holmes is not worried about a general problem with the Senior Apartments. “All of the applications for the other Senior Apartments and off-campus housing have been consistent with past years,” he says. The second phase for the remaining apartments will be held on Tuesday, March 25.

For the first time since its construction, there are empty apartments in MCF after Phase I. 

Cleaning out closets for homeless Clothing Drive
By ALEX OBREGON
Staff Writer

For the past two weeks, old clothes have been piling up in the lobbies of men’s halls all over campus. The reason for this is the annual spring cleaning men’s clothing drive which will be continuing through this week. Sponsored by the Homelessness Committee, a branch of Reach Out, this event will benefit the Uptown Men’s Shelter in Charlotte. The committee, co-chaired by Audrey Edmundson and Sezmin Noorani, has placed boxes in men’s dormitories all over campus collecting not only clothing items, but shoes, hats, and toiletries. The success of the clothing drive will be unknown until it officially ends this Saturday, but the committee is hopeful because, according to Noorani, “last year the turnout was amazing.”

Volunteers from Davidson will also help distribute the clothing at the shelter. The men staying there do jobs around the shelter to earn “passes” to the clothing closet where they can pick out what they need. Through this process, the volunteers develop a personal relationship with the men in the shelter. The clothing drive “doesn’t really end,” says Noorani. The Homelessness Committee is always looking for donations and volunteers. Trips to the shelter leave every Saturday afternoon at 12:30 from Belk parking lot in front of Richardson Dorm. Transportation is always provided.
