Hats Off?
Orchids to the Beta senior class. Within twenty-four hours after the start of the student drive, every member of that class had pledged $50 or more out of his own pocket. If every other member of the student body would catch the spark of the spirit manifested there, even though he might not be able to pledge as much, the drive couldn't fail. Add to that spirit what we could get from outside sources, and we could stretch that one-day holiday to two.

Out-of-state students have an edge on everybody else. Alumni there will not be reached at all for several months, maybe not at all. Many of them would actually appreciate being asked to take a part in the drive. Most of them would be glad to help if only somebody will contact them.

Attention Independents!
The Independents have been designated as one of the twelve organizations comprising the Student Campaign of the Development Program. Once again we are faced with the perennial problem of functioning as an organization without an efficient administration. We are certain, however, that we can meet the challenge and uphold our heritage as the oldest brotherhood on the campus. Our goal for the drive is $4500. This means a per capita contribution of about $30. Although our total is high, our individual requirements are lower than those of any other group. The reason for this is the fact that in setting our quota the student committee recognized that the Independents are on the whole weaker financially than the fraternities. The fact that such important factors have been considered should encourage us to do our best to accomplish what is expected of us.

Inter-group competition will not be as strong an incentive for us as for the other organizations. We might consider this to be an advantage, since we shall not be tempted to overshadow the real objective of the drive—to build a better Davidson—with an attempt to “outdo the Joneses.” Competition is a good thing so long as we remember its true, underlying purpose. We wish to thank The Davidsonian for recognizing our problem of communication within our group and allowing us this space to set forth our task.

Letter to the Editor
If the writer of the letter to the editor in the February 11, 1949, issue of the Davidsonian who commented on the chapel program of February 4, 1949, led by Mr. Hugh Farrior, would have signed his name instead of just A STUDENT, I could have some respect for him. However, that personal aspect is not the topic of my letter. If “A Student” would acquaint himself with, first of all, Mr. Farrior, and secondly, the facets of life, I do believe that he would have a more complete understanding of the manner in which Mr. Farrior conducted the devotional service.

Without taking any time to defend Mr. Farrior (look up his record—it speaks for itself) I would like to make a few comments about what I believe to have been a very enlightening presentation of some much-needed information. You (“A Student”) mention that the talk associated the Scriptures with lusty and sensual thoughts, and you continued the balance of your letter on that general theme. Mr. Farrior used the words, “Let’s see how your girl stacks up against the scriptures describes...” (or words to that effect). In any event he did use that particular phrase STACK UP, and I venture to say that it is upon those two words that your whole conception of a lusty association with the scriptures is based. If that is true, you have only yourself to blame for the interpretation. Granted, the connotation that you took is lusty and derogatory, but there is also a former connotation of the word that literally implies the stacking up of one set of qualities against another to compare the height of the two sets so as to reach conclusions as to the merits of each. When I say former connotation I mean before the war. During the war your conception of the meaning of the words STACK UP came into vogue. As a veteran of that war, Mr. Farrior was undoubtedly aware of the fact that his usage of the phrase would attract attention to what else he had to say, and to get that attention (the attention that is lacking during most chapel services) he very carefully chose to express himself in the vernacular. Those in the audience who have seen a little more of life understood exactly what was meant and why the phrase was used.

The Bible was given to us for a great many reasons, paramount of which is to point the way to Salvation. However, not to be overlooked is the fact that in addition to the central theme, the whole pattern of life is outlined and described, and remedies are given to those people who, having personal problems, will take time to read The Book. Too often The Book is left lying in a conspicuous place for all to see, but rarely is it used in the more intimate and practical aspects of life by more than just a handful of the students here or elsewhere. The reason being that such tied-together pictures as Mr. Farrior presented for our elucidation are seldom rendered. If I may interpret Mr. Farrior, I'm sure that one of his real concerns was to get across to the students here that the Bible is an unfathomable source of information for answers to all of life’s perplexing questions, and that to get that idea into the minds of students he used the methods that you (“A Student”) just don’t seem to comprehend.
— ROBERT H. JOHNSON.

Dear Editor:
In reference to the letter concerning Mr. Farrior’s Chapel talk, which you printed last week; and to several other so-called letters to the editor which the Davidsonian has printed this year, I would like to say that any letter which appears in the Davidsonian...

“WAIT! WAIT! THEY HAVE TO HAVE ANOTHER DRIVE BEFORE THEY CAN GET ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY ANY...”

Operating Table
After a conspicuous absence from the pages of the Davidsonian, it is with a great deal of pleasure that we reinstate the best known of Davidson traditions, the Operating Table, having accumulated a sufficiency of information concerning local big dogs and their meanderings. As in the past, we find at the top of the column our own alphabetical boys, Ashmore, McAllister and Millar, who were seen drifting toward Lynchburg Monday morning. We were glad to see them returning to ole D.C. It seems that Hugo was a great influence in their getting back. The travelers have been North and South already and next weekend the boys are headed West.

Reports from local establishments indicate a rising number of “patients” among Davidson students especially during the weekend. First Sergeant reports that his regular clients are “Slug” Keith, Doc Bailey and Ralph Alexander. The famous WCTU and “Rickey, the Rabbit” Richards are at the present times at odds. It seems that frequent 68-mile...trips. North have abruptly come to a screeching halt, because of the action taken in regard to extra-curricular activities in the Pavin City. Seen Midwinter's weekend was Ted Sumner wandering the streets of Charlotte mumbling something about an unfamiliar term “Tocky.” After finding "Tocky" we were all happy to have Ted and Tocky at the dance Saturday night.

The Penn School of Research has seen the services of “Sleepless” Ed Montgomery for an experiment on human endurance. It seems that Ed went sleepless Midwinter weekend and has exhausted the Cannon Mills supply of wash rags. Last, but not least, of the dealings was VPage Jackson, who got in mud trouble on his way back from Gastonia, and was heard to mutter, “I’ll never come that way again.” Here comes the man with the time clock and flashlight so, must close for present... May you all have nice dreams...

Many years ago the accepted idea of an education was not what it is today for in those days the elective system was non-existent and the student had little or no choice concerning what he would take during his stay in college. In the past two generations, however, the consensus of opinion among educators has made the pendulum swing toward the opposite extreme so that today the student has almost unlimited choice as to what he will take. Because of the elective system, the present-day college does not seem to offer to its students any well-organized and integrated body of facts. I mean that it is a simple matter for the modern student to go through most liberal arts colleges in the country and come out knowing nothing other than his own chosen and specialized field. Thus a student may matriculate at a college and spend four years there and graduate without ever knowing that men like Plato, Rousseau, and Da Vinci were other than famous pedants, or that a course in Political Science might be helpful in fulfilling the coming obligations of self.

Is The Present Idea Of Education Satisfactory?
By R. B. DIETRICK

Considerable hodgepodge of almost entirely unrelated facts. Colleges nowadays seem to aim, if they have a well-defined aim, only at preparing a student to make a living, and little else. One would think that the problem of making a living, per se, could generally be handled by vocational, technical, and graduate institutions, leaving the Liberal Arts schools the task of giving the student a broad general background in all fields of learning. In this way, the student would be prepared to specialize in any field of knowledge after he had completed his general education and was ready for graduate school. In some cases, the present system of college education seems to produce mass production, a vast number of men who are slaves to their profession through virtue of the fact that they know almost nothing but that pertaining to their chosen field. In view of this fact, many students and college graduates do not feel that they are getting or have gotten all that they should out of a college education. Those who would defend the elective system contend that it gives the student more individual freedom, and in doing so makes him more cognizant of his ultimate responsibilities. True though this may be, the system has not carried over into all fields of life and many parents refuse to give children the privilege on the basis that the child does not know what is good for it. It seems that this principle should also be present in the organization of colleges, insofar that they require (Continued On Page Four).

AMONG THE PI KAPPA PHI

Up to Virginia went four of the crew, To see how much damage they could do. They sped through the country like a rocket ship, Until the law put a stop to the trip. Now that the story can be truly told, The crowd included both young and old. Parks and Bengy, Merb and the Lock Went up to check out the Sweetbriar flock...

All the cats were out Monday night, To hear “I’ll do things up right.” Never a show here like that before, But the crowd would really go for more. Bob Bumbarger and Walter McSwain Seem to be heading for the H H Train. Regular trips at the beckoning call Will put their names in the H H Hall. Look out boys, it can happen to you; Daddy-O Mead will tell you true.

The question of the week concerns E B, And ‘tis a wee bit complicated as you can see. Who Oh Who is the Apple of his eye? Is it Betty, Frost, or Little Vi? The pledges done good with their little shows; Glad to see we have a few Moes. And now that WEEK is over, The Freshmen are really in the clover.

Just a word about Saturday night In case you are anxious or filled with fright, A date at Queens ain't a fate worse than death, If you don't mind taking what might be left. If you’d like to know what you're to behold, Berwyn knows all we're told, Of course, the paper'll come out late, After you've missed the chance to hesitate.

Charlotte will long remember the day That its big shots moved out of the way, To let some characters from Epsilon take The reins of the City for Davidson's sake. Frost let the Union National go broke, And Carlos gave away Belk’s clothes for a joke. Walter made off with Brown's dry goods, While Earl goofed off at Sir Jack Wood's. Lander took over the Observer's publisher's job, And then gave a holiday to the whole blooming mob. Reconstruction is now underway, So maybe the city will prosper some day. Take it easy, boys, I'll see you next week, It's been a pleasure, Signed, Geek...

BETA THETA PI

The long winter for Beta pledges last week culminated in a chilling Hell Week blizzard which blew with force and fury for five days and nights. Those surviving the ordeal and entering into the warm springtime of brotherhood were: Frances Peppey, Pat Patton, John Jervis, Winslow Ballew, Pete Kalogridis, Jack McPheeters, Furman Ferguson, Roy Horne, Ralph Northeutt, Bob Holmes, Blaine Nimocks, Stuart Shipper, George Gatlin, Henry Bridges, Kelley Leacraft.

Following the formal initiation on Friday night, February 11, there was a steak dinner at the boarding house, and in the words of our own “Rev.” Bill Smith, “A fine spirit was manifest.” District Chief Columbus S. Barbour was in attendance and obliged with a story which he thought was rather funny. Chalmers was speechless for once, but Doc Fulton addressed an eloquent welcome to an old member of his “mob,” Bob Gourley. The revelry extended far into the night and the new brothers went home craning their necks at the little black shields on their shirts. Before falling exhausted into bed, all stood before their mirrors to comb their new coiffures—courtesy of the Shaw Tonsorial Parlor—"Tony” Shaw, proprietor.

KAPPA SIGMA

Now everyone has recovered from the dances—that is, nearly everyone—Mike is still talking about that dance with Mary Akers. Ask him about it, Dot. Congratulations to our pledges in becoming brothers. Bill Williamson was heard to remark, “It’s funny that when we first came to college, we were treated like kings. Then we were treated like servants and since becoming brothers, we are now human beings.”

Brother Morgan remained backstage all during that fine Tommy Dorsey concert. From the looks of several of the men in the orchestra, Mouse would fit right into T. D.’s outfit. Last heard of Mouse was explaining his approach (to the piano, of course) to Paul Smith. Snookie came to the concert with Red Man after Selly phoned her that he couldn’t make it. Also seen at the concert were Hook and Sarah Hunter (Mary Jane couldn't come), Brother Archibald and Gitch, and Brother Spider and Gussie, Roddey and Alma. While on the subject of concerts, let us say that Brother Rankin is extremely insulted that he hasn't been asked to give a guitar concert. Maybe he and Mouse can be persuaded to entertain us down at the house sometime—some weekend when we're all gone!

We all hope that Lenoir Keesler will be back with us soon. He has had his knee operated on, but he is getting along pretty good now. The Hoke House gang is awaiting your arrival, Lenoir, so hurry and get well.

The Poll-cat
By CHARLIE REID

For next year, would you favor continuing or discontinuing the 85 percent rule that is now in force in the government, or that a course in economics would undoubtedly be of aid in understanding the reasons for international disagreement or that a course in music appreciation would help me get more enjoyment out of the process of living. In many ways, it would seem that the present college graduate is an individual who has successfully passed 120-128 semester hours in the most expedient possible manner, and whose principal recommendation is that he has acquired a considerable hodgepodge of almost entirely unrelated facts.
