Francis grabs NC laurels in summer sailing events

By CLIFF GARDINER

Senior Dave Francis has improved tremendously as a competitive sailor since coming to Davidson College.

Francis competed in two major regattas late this summer. In the middle of August, he claimed an eighth-place finish in
the Force Five (sailing class) North American Championship at Hampton Roads, Va. Then, on September 6 and 7 in his
hometown of New Bern, N.C., Francis captured the North Carolina State Championship for the Force Five class, a division of
small sailboats designed for medium-strength winds.

These impressive showings come from someone who had sailed in only one organized race before coming to Davidson. However, Francis
shies away from putting too much stock in his rather glamorous title, North Carolina Force Five Champion.

“It sounds a whole lot bigger deal than it is,” Francis said.

In fact, Francis candidly admits that winning the second race of the five-race North Carolina regatta “was really kind of
a fluke, I felt.” In that key race, Francis’ two main opponents made the horrendous error of sailing about one-half
mile past a mark. Francis capitalized on the mistake to take first place in that particular race which, combined with
steady third-place finishes in the other four races, gave Francis the top spot over the other ten sailors in the
N.C. Championship.

In the August regatta, Francis had come back from a disastrous forty-seventh place finish in the first race of the
North American Championships. He was successful enough in the next six races to achieve his strong eighth-place finish during the
fifty-four boat meet.

Francis indicated that his showings in these two summer events, plus his three years of experience at Davidson, have bolstered
his confidence for the sailing competition at school this year. Despite his expectations that the competition in the South Atlantic
Intercollegiate Sailing Association (to which Davidson belongs) could be the toughest since he has been here, Francis commented, though, that
he thought he could hold his own now.

Captain of the Davidson team, Francis will sail “A” Division this Saturday, September 20 in Charleston, S.C., for Davidson's initial
fall conference regatta. Crewing for him will probably be Laurie Bingaman, a freshman. Sophomore Chuck Barrineau will sail “B” Division
for Davidson.
