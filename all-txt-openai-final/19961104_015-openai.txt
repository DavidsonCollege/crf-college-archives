Men’s soccer looks to make noise at conference tourney

Now the second season begins. After struggling throughout much of the regular season, Davidson hopes it can shine in the
Southern Conference tournament this weekend at Furman.

“We need to put the season behind us and focus on the games this weekend,” said sophomore goalkeeper Brad Stroble.
“We need to realize that each game is potentially our last.”

The fifth-seeded Wildcats (7-13, 3-3) open the tournament Friday at noon when they face Appalachian St. Davidson hopes to avenge
a 1-0 regular season loss at Boone.

The Wildcats snapped a nine-game losing streak on October 25 with a 2-1 win over Georgia Southern. And the Wildcats
played inspired soccer two days later, despite losing at fourth-ranked UNC-Charlotte 1-0.

Coach Charlie Slagle hopes this sudden resurgence, along with two weeks of rest, will give his Wildcats the winning formula
this weekend.

“The hope is that these two weeks can be used as a mini-training camp,” said Slagle. “It gives us a
chance to straighten some things out.”

One thing the Wildcats have to straighten out is how to score goals. Davidson has been shut out nine times
this year and has been outscored 34-5 in its last eleven games.

“We have to start converting on our scoring chances,” said Slagle. “Even if it’s ugly, a goal is still a
goal.”

If the Wildcats can get by App. St. on Friday, they would face top-seeded Furman, which has a first-round bye.
Other first-round match-ups include Georgia Southern versus VMI and Marshall versus The Citadel.

The team knows they have the ability to win the tournament and advance to an NCAA play-in game.

“We have the talent to beat anyone, we just have to make sure that we have the desire,” said Stroble.

Seniors Fernando Campos and Keith Kleeman joke around during practice this week. The team travels to Furman on Friday in
an attempt to repeat as conference tournament champions and salvage what has been a disappointing season.

Cornerback Graham stepped into a new leadership role when Barrington went down, shutting down opponents’ toughest pass-catching threat on a
weekly basis.

Ariail, who had led the team in tackles before being sidelined by a leg injury for a few weeks earlier
this fall, has re-emerged as a force on the defensive line.

Possession receiver Roberts recently vaulted to tenth on Davidson’s all-time receiving list.

And placekicker Mileham, Saturday’s hero, notched the third-longest field goal in school history—a 50-yarder—on Oct. 28 versus Randolph-Macon.

“You’ll see a lot of good things from Davidson football in the future,” Cowan continued. “We feel like we’re leaving
this program better than when we came into it. I think that was our whole goal during our four years
here.”

Mission accomplished.

that caliber of competition is a testament to the progress this program is making,” Jason Prince said. “You don’t like
to lose, but the small margin points towards a great future for this team.”

Freddy Schnell, Sam Kuykendall, and Michael Hart starred on the men’s side. Schnell, who has primarily swum backstroke, swam the
1,000 free, 500 free, and anchored the free relay, all firsts against Virginia Tech and seconds versus William & Mary.
Kuykendall won the 200 fly, was second in the 200 back, and third in the 1,000 free against William &
Mary (fifth versus Tech). Hart won both 1 meter and 3 meter diving.
