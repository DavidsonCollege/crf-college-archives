**Commitment Redefined**
William Crone and Cari Shulman

On page 11 of the College Catalog, there is a section entitled “Technological Literacy” which explains how Davidson College is
finding new ways “...to help all students acquire an understanding of the interaction of modern technology with society.” No one
can deny that high technology surrounds the Davidson campus; it is evident in a variety of forms ranging from a
computer terminal to a Scanning Electron Microscope. It should be obvious that Davidson College is definitely working toward the goal
of becoming “...a leader among liberal arts colleges in dealing with modern technology.”

Despite these stated goals, there is evidence that the College is not fully committed to them. For example, during Winter
Term 1982-83, Davidson installed its new ISI-40 Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) in the basement of the Dana Science Building. An
anonymous benefactor donated $60,000 for its purchase with the intention of developing technology at Davidson for faculty and student research.
Since that time, the SEM has provided a unique educational opportunity. Both biology and physics students have taken advantage of
the SEM, an instrument rarely available for undergraduate study. Malcolm Campbell '84 used his experience on the SEM to win
a Watson Fellowship. Many students have worked with the SEM, and many more wish to do so.

Unfortunately, the SEM sits idle. The SEM needs maintenance. As with any technologically advanced instrument, the SEM requires frequent adjustments
to remain in peak operating condition, and breakdowns are not uncommon. Until now, a service contract between the College and
International Scientific Instruments Company has covered the SEM maintenance. Under the contract, which can be annually renewed, the Company agreed
to repair the SEM whenever the College requested at no cost beyond the initial cost of the contract. This arrangement
worked well until February of this year when the two-year coverage included in the purchase price expired. At present, the
College has not made any attempt to renew the contract. Instead, access to the SEM by students, as well as
faculty, has been completely denied. Although Davidson claims to have a commitment to developing technology and exposing students to it,
one of our most advanced instruments is being mothballed by the College.

Davidson College refuses to renew the SEM service contract—the price necessary to keep up with modern technology. This frugality is
restricting the learning opportunities of the students as well as faculty research. The problem facing the SEM is not isolated
to equipment in the biology department; Davidson possesses a fair amount of advanced instruments. Will these be subjected to the
same treatment as the SEM? If Davidson College is going to accept gifts in the form of high technological equipment,
then it must assume responsibility for their maintenance. One can only imagine how the benefactor who gave the SEM will
feel if Davidson is not willing to maintain the equipment he has provided. More importantly, how will other benefactors view
this unwillingness to maintain our technologically advanced equipment? Our concern represented by the plight of the SEM centers on Davidson's
commitment to technology. Technology should not be limited to the Sloan Symposia. Is Davidson fully committed to developing technology for
student and faculty use, or is it merely committed to owning fancy, in-vogue machines that do not work?

**Religion And Politics In America**
Tim Brown

President Reagan stated, “Religion and politics are necessarily related.” Geraldine Ferraro said, “Reagan's policies mean he is not a good
Christian,” while the archbishop of New York questioned whether she deserved the support of fellow Catholics. Mondale was shown leaving
church with his family. Before departing in his limousine, he took time to explain how he grew up in a
parsonage. At the Democratic National Convention, Jesse Jackson delivered a speech, a sermon from the pulpit, to garner democratic votes.
Let’s look at the problems resulting from the conjunction of religion and politics in America.

Freedom of speech gives religious leaders the right to speak for or against governmental issues. It gives politicians the right
to appeal to denominations for votes. However, church and state are put at risk when politicians seek to join them.
Are people who seek prayer in school the only true patriots? Should a Catholic politician, or a Jewish politician, impose
his beliefs on others? Religious issues such as abortion, school prayer, and homosexuals’ rights debase the level of public debate,
distract from the political issues, and needlessly intensify divisions within our society. Politicians use religion as a test for loyalty
and patriotism. Americans still have freedom of religion. However, who would choose to be agnostic at risk of seeming antipatriotic
or un-American? Evidently, political officials feel this pressure themselves. Dwight D. Eisenhower never joined a church. Only after becoming president
in 1952 did he attend church weekly. The following quotations are taken from The New York Times just weeks...prior to
the 1952 election. It is evident that Dwight D. Eisenhower felt the need to convey his religiousness to the American
public. On September 16, 1952, he explained, “I knew a philosopher who sought the reason for American Genius. The reason
turned out to be the Church.” On November 4, 1952, he stated, “The Church places faith in the hearts of
American children. It is this faith that makes America strong.” With regard to this second quotation, the reader should note
that America was at war with Korea. Brown is a freshman from Charlotte, N.C.

The Generation Of Noise
Dr. Karl Plank

We have become a people of noise. Like any community, we engage in seasonal rituals of celebration that render audible
our relief at the end of a term’s labor or mark a significant turn in our year. That we are
a people capable of celebration gives a sign of vitality and offers a promise of the interruption of exhausting routine.
Yet, as a people of noise, our rumbling volume far surpasses our occasions of celebration. Noise has become a way
of life. Its crescendo threatens us with an alienation that would rob us of that fabric of community within which
we genuinely encounter each other and ourselves.

The technological advances in stereophonic equipment, when combined with the onset of spring weather, point to the most blatant cultivation
of noise. Seemingly, the sheer possibility of noise-making has become justification for turning stereo speakers outward and volume knobs toward
their maximum. Not for special occasion, but as a normal way of life, we fill empty spaces with the outward
blare of electric din. Whether mid-day or midnight, mid-week or weekend, potentially “our hills come alive with the sound of...
noise.”

The stereophonic abuse is an acute case in point of a larger tendency that finds us at odds with moments
of stillness and silence. We chatter and congregate with a compulsive energy, scarcely masking our addiction to social activity. How
strange, at an institution devoted to reflection, to hear complaints of there being no place quiet enough to think. How
striking to find students forced into flight from library and dorm to take sanctuary in alcoves outside faculty offices or
in the shelter of Chambers’ restrooms. How disturbing to live in a community where one must struggle exceptionally to be
alone from time to time.

To our detriment, we have become used to the noise that encompasses us—so much so that we have fallen deaf
to its threat. Our issue is not whether we can adjust to noise, but rather should we adjust to its
presence? I think that it is imperative that we should not “get used to it.” The dangers of becoming complacent
to our own noise are far too great to be accepted as routine.

The tyranny of noise poses both ethical and spiritual problems. Ethically, the proliferation of noise wreaks a violence of sorts
and constitutes “auditory aggression.” Violence occurs whenever a person is forced to respond to conditions imposed by the will of
another. There exists no real difference between the act of turning stereo speakers toward the place of others as they
seek to go about the business of thinking, resting, working, or conversing, and the act of kicking their door in
to demand some attention. Any difference is of degree, not kind. Noise excludes the freedom of the other and, as
such, simply must not become our normal way of life.

The proclivity for noise, moreover, suggests a spiritual crisis. By this, I do not mean something peculiarly religious, but a
crisis in that spirit which shapes the quality of our personal interaction and well-being. As an act of violence, noise
forcefully demands recognition of its maker, but at the same time, it creates a barrier that prevents any other from
drawing near even to recognize or to affirm. The community of noise is always an artificial community, for within it
persons appear to be together, but without the responsibilities and potential of genuine relatedness. Gathered around the stereo (or the
appropriately termed “blaster”) we tend not to share ourselves, only the noisy wall that separates us.

Lastly, behind the barricade of noise we hide most of all from ourselves. The questions and fears which press us
from within and force us to grapple with our human identity cannot be banished forever. Eventually, the night is theirs.
However, these precious inner voices are all too easily diverted and obscured by the noise around us, lost for the
time being in the most superficial of chatter. The threat is this: if we cannot really be alone with ourselves,
then neither can we be genuinely related to another. A people of noise: of what horror are we so afraid
that we hide from silence and solitude, ourselves and each other, to take refuge in the empty clatter of our
own making?

Plank is an assistant professor of Religion.
