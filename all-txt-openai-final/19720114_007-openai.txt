Delts, SAEs Pull IMAC Upsets By HOWARD BOYD Asst. Sports Editor

Delt II, Watts II, and the SAEs knocked Emanon II from the unbeaten ranks to highlight IMAC basketball action this
week. The E's victory over Emanon II left them tied for first in League A with 4-1 marks. In League
B, the Delts lead at 5-1 with Keeter’s right behind at 4-0. Another pair of unbeaten teams, Emanon 5-0 and
Porter’s 4-0, are atop League C. Emanon III defeated the Nus 40-30, edged the Pikas 53-50 behind Bill Bencini’s 15
points, and toppled Cannon II 51-43 as Bill Giduz hit for 19 points. In their last outing before the loss
to the E's, they pounded the Plumbers 76-38 as Bob Ismer gunned in 22.

Rifle Team Tackles Presbyterian Today

Despite Max Thomasson's match-leading 259, the Davidson rifle team dropped their third straight match last week to the Richmond gunners
by a slim 12-point margin. The team will participate in two matches this weekend, tackling Presbyterian today and Clemson tomorrow.
Coach Richard Carmody was hopeful for the PC match, but dubious of the ‘Cats chances against the Tigers. “Clemson has
a real strong program,” he said, “they're on a level with The Citadel.” Carmody said that the team’s chances were
greatly improved by the return of Larry Crowell, a regular from last year who was unable to work with the
team in the fall. The team also has three freshmen, Jim Fagan, Gary Frank, and Henry Barber, who Carmody said
should “help form a nucleus for next year.”

The E's opened with a big win over Delt III 31-30 behind a balanced attack. Eldin Basham and John Webel
had 20 and 18 points, respectively, in a 99-32 romp over the Plumbers, and teamed for 33 more to lead
a 67-38 triumph over the Nus. F&M handed the E's their only setback 51-40 despite Butch Baird's 18 markers. Tony
Martin's 17 was tops for the winners. In League B, the Delts, behind Greg and Mike Sikes, have reeled off
wins over Cannon I 34-44, Sentelle I 79-68, the Betas 39-46, the KAs 85-49.and crushed PAX Wednesday for their fifth
straight. Greg Sikes canned 18 against Cannon I. and tossed in 24 while Mike hit for 16 to offset a
32-point barrage by the losers’ Bill McKinnon. Greg fired in 23 more in a big win over the Betas, whose
Randy Ely hit for 17. Against the KAs he pumped in 29 and Mike collected 16. Keeter's has not been
pressed yet. Behind 35 points by Steve Williams, they buried Sentelle I 92-32. Williams had 78 more as they drubbed
Emanon II 79-32. Mike O'Malley and Gary Scibal combined for 46 points to blast the KAs 63-31, and O’Malley hit
for 20 as they ran past Big E 61-32. Porter’s, like Keeter’s, has not yet met its first test. Frank
Clark totaled 57 points in wins over Watts I 68-44 and Beta II 80-53, and headed a balanced attack against
the Gammas (60-47) and Pax I (78-28). Emanon edged the SPEs Wednesday to remain unbeaten. The shooting of Frank Folger
and Sam Upchurch paced wins over Pax II 110-17, Gammas 90-61, Cannon II 105-47, and a big win over the
previously-unbeaten Taus 79-68.
