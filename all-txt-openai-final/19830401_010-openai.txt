10 Friday, April 1, 1983 / The Davidsonian

Many people at D.C. harbor misconceptions about the authors of the Booze Brothers column. Because we call ourselves the “Booze” Brothers, many people are led to believe that all we do is get drunk and make up abusive one-liners. Nothing could be further from the truth! Due to diminishing wallets and increasing waistlines, the Booze Bros. have embarked upon a novel get-fit-quick plan: the Forty Days to Fitness. The Boozeless Brothers have taken a solemn vow (and several wagers) not to drink for 40 days. BB has decided that they do not need alcohol to have fun. Just look at the DCFers and the KAs — they’ve been doing it for years! In honor of this program, the Boozeless Brothers now take a gander at the non-alcoholic fun spots on campus. (Wait a minute! Whose gander are you taking? That’s an Honor Code viol— Oh, we see now. It’s just an expression. We're sorry. — Hunter Orwell’s 1984 Honor Council Police.)

Fun Spot Number One — Spring Football Practice
Ah! ’Tis spring, and a young Delt’s fancy turns toward beating the hell out of about 80 other people intent on doing the same thing to him. Why anybody would go out and do this is beyond us. After all, Big Ed’s heart isn’t in it anymore. Everyone knows that Farrell’s first love is seeing the “minor” sports succeed. “I would much rather take in a good women’s lacrosse game than come out here with these jokers,” Farrell commented. Cat’s Outlook: Off-season trade of Wendell Washington to the Crisco Fat Farm hurts Cats... Keith Martin continues to improve, averaging only 32 interceptions a day... Cat’s training room is overflowing with sutures following the departure of Bryan “Windows” Lowe. BB’s Spring Game Prediction: Pikes 52, Cats 0.

Fun Spot Number Two: ROTC Drill Field
As BB watched a squad of young cadets vying for the department’s Alexander Haig Memorial “Kill the F---ing Commies” Award, we tried to decide if there was any significance in the fact that “ROTCic” rhymes with “Nazi.” As we contemplated the matter further, our hearts were warmed by the realization that a bunch of really good guys are training to protect truth, justice, and the Davidson way against the influx of the godless Communists. As junior cadet Barney Earnhardt noted, “If these guys can’t kick some a--, who can?” IMAC Boxing Czars Dave West and Doug Wiley were unavailable for comment.

[Dear BB: OK, that’s enough! We hired you to write Booze Brothers, and you’ll damn well write about booze! Now get to it! Dave and Ann]

Alright if you say so. A quick BB recap of the partying events of the week: As almost everyone on this side of campus knows, the E’s had their 100th Anniversary Celebration last week. The Hoddies kicked off a week of partying with Eli Wednesday night. Unfortunately, the band failed to show so the E’s pumped 95-Q through the speakers. The band was impersonated by several SAEs, featuring the Throbber as lead vocalist. The Throbbing One also contributed by using his head as a mirror ball. The smoke screen was provided by a bunch of DCFers smoking bong hits under the stage. High point of the evening: Lafayette and Clark slapping hands in the back.

Moving on to Thursday, the 900 Room was rockin’ as Ester Kim really outdid herself on the SGA Weekend Disco. A quick summary: Preppy sweaters look like an acid nightmare, loud Top 40 music, lots of shagging, BB vomits and leaves. ’Nuff said.

Friday: The Italian Stallion throws a party, Georgia whips St. John’s, Attar suffers heart failure as another Big East team loses to another Southern team. A good night.

Saturday: Emanon and PAX throw a joint (no, not that kind) party. Emanon’s bar is closed, PAX’s is open. Is there any sanity here? Lance and BB are baffled. Glance spins good tunes; no KAs, Delts, SPEs, or Pikes present. Mixed reviews.

Bruise-that Palm Sunday: Day gets off to a good start as the Dawgs beat the snot out of Carolina (Ha, ha, ha! Go to hell, all you Heels!) BB rolls off to Chapel Hill with Johnny Mod and Co. to catch the Beat and REM. Lucy is with us, REM is hot, the Beat blows us away. Great times at a Real school. That’sAll for this week. Join us again next week as BB finally releases its long-awaited 1st Team All-Faculty Party Squad. Until then, go cry in your beer, Carolina. Go Dogs! Sic 'em! Woof woof woof woof woof!
