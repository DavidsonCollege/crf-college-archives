### STRESS

**Lauren Stutts:**

You have 3 papers, 4 finals, 10 meetings, you lost your cat card, accidentally pressed “reply to all” on a
private email, and bit your tongue. Face it: if you’re at Davidson, then you are stressed. You have a couple
of options. You can think about how stressed you are, bite your nails, and pull out your hair, or you
can try one of the following stress relievers.

- **Exercise:** Work out at the Union or Baker, run around the track, or dance to music.
- **Chocolate:** ‘Nough said.
- **Take a long, hot shower:** Don’t forget to sing.
- **Watch a funny or light-hearted movie:** Disney movies are a must.
- **Make a plan:** Write down whatever problem’s stressing you out and decide how you are going to solve it
step by step.
- **Get off campus:** Cruise on over to Concord Mills Mall, check out the downtown scene in Charlotte, or just
go out to dinner in Huntersville.
- **Talk to a counselor, friend, parent, squirrel, stuffed animal, etc.:** Sometimes just verbalizing your problems to someone or something
can help.
- **Look at the bright side of things:** Stress burns calories!

**Jenn Greene:**

I have one remedy: baths. Baths are the epitome of relaxation. There is nothing quite equivalent to drawing a tub
of steaming water, throwing in some aroma-therapy salts, lighting a few candles, putting on some Kenny G (that’s for you,
Steve), and easing your tense body into paradise.

My suggestions for a perfect bath:

- Run the water as hot as you can stand it; remember, if you are in there a while, the
water gets cool, quick.
- Get some sparkly bath lotion. That’s just fun.
- Use a shower cap. There is nothing worse than getting in the tub, getting soap and such in your
hair, and then having to stand up after you are all relaxed and have to wash and rinse your hair.
Ugh. Remember: the point of a bath is to RELAX, not to get clean.
- The more candles, the better.
- Make sure to have post-bath operations ready and waiting. Warm up towels in a dryer and cover them with
another towel to keep the warmth in. Use the fluffiest ones you can find. Have bedroom shoes waiting for you
as you emerge so the tootsies don’t suffer. Put a chocolate or mint on your pile of towels or on
your bathrobe to top off the experience.
- Try to get the bath in right before you sleep. When the body is relaxed, the mind is free
to wander as it will. Embrace what dreams may come!

**Felicia Browne:**

I definitely want to emphasize Lauren’s point about talking to someone when you are stressed. Although talking to others may
seem like whining, it can be very helpful to have someone listen and (hopefully) empathize with you, even if he
or she doesn’t offer any suggestions.

But since I definitely overused that stress reliever last year, I have resorted to other methods, like taking a quick
nap (my perspective on stress always changes after a good nap), or listening to one of my favorite country CDs
(which are always comforting).

However, during my most stressed-out moments, sometimes I need to physically leave campus, whether it be a quick trip home,
or a walk down the road; because living less than 100 yards away from the building where my classes are
held only adds to my stress by making me feel trapped.

Tune in to the Body and Soul radio show on Wednesday nights between 10:00-11:00 on WALT 1610 AM: This week
we are having a wildcard show: we’ll talk about anything.
