must change a bit before the full benefits of such a program can be realized. Strong in “fraternity rights," the Greeks kept their little back room hell weeks, and while often entering fully into the activities of Greek Week, they seemed to have missed back in Centerville High! Well, when Myrtle, over in the riveting department here at Roundbottom Rowboats told me you were in college, do you know what I thought? I thought well, I just have to sacrifice this weekend to our country’s defense. I know you'll understand. Hoping to see you this summer, I remain, Cordially yours, BRUNWALD.

**Hard For Sports**  
In the inte games in 1948 Sweden came in second, losing only to the United States. Since this is another Olympic year and since we are going to beat USA this time, you might be interested in knowing how we can do it. In Sweden everybody plays some game or takes some kind of exercise all the year round. Even the housewives have gymnastic hours a couple of times every week and grandmother daily takes her shopping tour on her bike. Last summer a guy past his seventies made a sensation riding on a bike through the whole country in only five days. He was called “Steel-Grandpa” and became the hero of the nation, appearing in the theatres and public squares. Anyone who knows how to walk knows how to ski. In the wintertime, we ski to school and church and every now and then you can see a policeman chasing a fast thief on his skis. As you have seen in the movies, some courageous people jump on skis on certain hills constructed for “suicide.” To watch this is said to be more thrilling than to take part in a bullfight. Once in a while some candidate lands on his head and the funeral arrangements are announced over the loudspeaker.

In the summertime, we play football or, as you say, soccer, which is a fast and beautiful game. It is not as rough as American football which in Europe is looked upon as a link of American culture that, for some reason, is regarded rather unfavorably. The big events are the matches between the different European countries of which Sweden for a long time has been the best, except Italy, Yugoslavia and, of course, Russia. Our national game is bandy. It is played on ice and resembles ice hockey, only it is played with bent clubs and a ball. Basketball is a game for women and girls and baseball is completely ignored. Indoors we play handball that is nothing like your handball, but is played with the same rules, roughly speaking, as soccer, only you use your hands instead of your feet.

Sweden has produced some of the best long-distance runners in the world and athletics are compulsory all through high school. One thing that I don’t think exists here is what we call “orienteering.” It is sort of cross-country running but the difference is that here you have got to use your head, too. With the help of a compass, you have to find unknown stations on the map. It is a very nice sport especially when you get completely lost and are compelled to spend a couple of weeks in the dark living on lingonberries and with bears and wolves as your only company. Hunting is a very popular sport in my country. You are not regarded as a grown-up man until you have killed your first bear. Our hero-king, Charles XII, killed his at the age of 12 and at the historical spot, a big monument has been erected. I have not yet slaughtered one so it will be one of my first duties when I return. As you can see we keep in shape and, though latest reports from my country say that our 26 best ski jumpers are badly injured and the six outstanding runners have got lost in the woods, I feel confident that we will give America a pretty good fight in the Olympics.

flight training. In pre-flight school, the young fledgling learns the fundamental subjects essential to his future success as a pilot and an officer. While undergoing vigorous physical and military training, cadets study navigation, weather forecasting, engineering, and many other aviation courses. Four months later, with pre-flight school completed, the naval cadet enters basic flight training. After 22 hours of dual instruction in the SNJ “Texan Trainer,” the cadet goes up alone for the first time. This is only the beginning for the graduated cadet. He now learns acrobatics, dive bombing and gunnery, cross-country navigation, and finally aircraft carrier landings. The cadet after basic flight is assigned to advanced training, where he is taught the art of flying combat service type aircraft. Cadets are selected at this stage for training in carrier-based aircraft or multi-engine patrol bombers. On successfully completing the 18-month training period, the candidate is commissioned as an ensign, USNR, or 2nd Lt., USMCR, and assigned to an operating fleet squadron for a two and one-half years tour of active duty, during which time he is seasoned by experience and his combat skills sharpened. Following their tours of duty with the fleet, the young officers...

**GUNNERS HIT CLEMSON: PACK WIN UNDER BELT**  
Davidson's rifle team lines up on the Clemson pads tomorrow encouraged by a win over the Wolfpack last weekend with a score of 1793 out of 2000. Bill Morris was high ‘Cat gunner with a net of 367 out of a possible 400 points. Other high scores were registered by Bob Garrison, Wallace Abbott, Ken Parks, and Alan Groseclose in that order. Ten men fired for each of the teams. No indication of Davidson's showing in the Hearst Trophy matches has yet been received. A score of 919 out of a possible 1000 was recorded and this is “enough to place” according to Major George Jones, team coach. The figure shot this year is somewhat higher than that chalked up in last year's competition.

ones hurt all the more. If we manage to win 4 of our last 6 games we will finish 7-12. But just seven more points—2 against Carolina, 2 against WF, 3 against Clemson—and we would have had 3 more wins, 3 fewer losses for a 10-9 record. It's a little far-fetched, but that’s one way of looking at it. Still, no matter how much we talk about it, we can't rewrite those three games.

needs some interpretation. What is meant by...This statement is: the Student Body officers and members of the Student Council have shown initiative—they have not exhibited the desired quality of being able to solve problems. The desires, ideas, and opinions, although not directly, have been expressed many, many times over during the past three years, the length of my association with Davidson College. These officers and members of the Student Council, most of them have been here for three years but for some unexplainable reason they have not heard any desires, nor any ideas, nor any opinions expressed. No, they have heard! But they have not seen fit to take the initiative, exhibiting that quality of solving problems and finding the solutions to these problems, which no longer need any enumeration. They have waited until the situation in the ranks is such that it can no longer be tolerated. Things cannot be changed overnight, but there is no reason why we cannot begin working tonight! Let’s stop this bickering back and forth and get down to work!

Sincerely,
J. LEE HARTER.

Travel and study the point of the program. As we see it, Greek Week is the climax of the pledge period in fraternity life. As it turned out this year, many fraternities geared their formal initiation to culminate the week's activities. It is a period of acceptance of men who have been in a probationary state, into the fraternity life of the campus. The inter-fraternity action of a Greek Week—combined constructive work projects, exchange supper, the fellowship of a variety show—seems particularly vital to fraternities at Davidson, where we pride ourselves in the harmony and friendship and cooperation cutting across all fraternity and non-fraternity lines. Furthermore, we were under the impression that the Greek Week idea—individually or collectively practiced—was a sign of our fraternities’ trend toward maturity, i.e., elimination of hell week practices. True, it is a trend, but trends often die as such, without reaching their mark. Hopefully, we look for Greek Week’s benefits to so manifest themselves that fraternities will more and more come to see the incongruity of running the two simultaneously—or, indeed, of running a hell week at all. It must come if fraternities are to continue to raise themselves to a respected and accepted element of college life.

Dear Houstonia:
I got your letter today, and from all appearances you girls must be busy. That is the case with us. Incidentally, Houstonia, about that dance next weekend, I was overjoyed, of course, when you said you could come, and had really been looking forward to it, but fate just doesn't seem to be working our way. You see, the ROTC department here announced today that the entire corps will be going out on maneuvers next Tuesday. You can easily see that it would go pretty hard on our record if we were to spend the weekend any other way than preparing for this. Therefore, as much as I hate to, I'm afraid we'll have to room for doubt in his date’s mind. He is the confirmed ROTC student. His five-paragraph field order is dispatched, not sent; in a large brown envelope.

There are two extremes in female letters. One is as unwelcome as the other, though their objectives are opposed. Leap year is interpreted as legal sanction for the first extreme.

Dear Bill:
Hi! Long time, no see, as we used to say! It's sure been a long time since I heard from you—three years, eight months and five days, I think—that I'll bet you've almost forgotten the swell times we used to have - drop old Bill a line! So here it is!

Everything here in Centerville is fine, except that Eddie Taylor—you know Eddie, the one who lost his diploma for tap dancing across the stage at graduation—fell and broke his leg last week. He was running a dancing studio and do you know what? I had finished the complete course just two days before he fell and had to quit teaching! Wasn't that lucky?

Things here at the plant are kind of slow since I switched from welding to loading and shipping. In fact, I get off work at noon on Friday and don't have to be back on the line until 5:30 Monday morning! Pretty swell, huh?

That's about all the news from here! I guess you spend all of your time studying now, huh? Gee, didn’t we used to have some swell times back in high school, though?

Your good friend,
Minerva.

P.S. Your mother sure has been swell letting me play my Charlie Spivak records to practice dancing at your house since the handle on our phonograph broke. Pretty swell of her, huh?

As ever,
Minnie.

No matter what type of student he may be, a boy is not a man until he has been through the rigors of the second female extreme. It is exactly two pages long and on plain white paper. The mere simplicity of its salutation has made it immortal among American literary types. What else? but the mute and eloquent: Dear John...

But if a woman hast thou undone, then heav'n will mend thee with another one. Life is too precious to be spent in this weaving and unweaving of false impressions, and it is better to live quietly under some degree of misrepresentation than to attempt to remove it by the uncertain process of letter-writing.
G. Eliot.
