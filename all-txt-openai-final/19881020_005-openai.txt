THE DAVIDSONIAN

Why all the tie-dyes? Do sixties fashions belie sixties attitudes?

By LISA GERRARD

A few years back, students who wore tie-dyed t-shirts, torn blue jeans, and “Jesus sandals” were few and far between on the Davidson College campus. Men with long hair stood out, and hardly anyone wore friendship bracelets. But styles have changed, and what was once considered radical and a statement of individuality has become the vogue.

Mixed reactions accompany the new trend in fashion. More conservative dressers like senior Robert Smalley are amused at their friends who were wearing Duck pants and oxford button-downs last year, but who now opt for cut-off blue jeans and t-shirts. Those who were “hip” when hippies weren’t cool wish the fad would fade; in the meantime, Spencer House has a tie-dye Friday Afternoon Club, and the college Student Store continues to sell its own psychedelic t’s.

The look used to be radical—a statement of individuality very few dared, or desired, to make. The connotations were sometimes good: free spirit, social activist, at peace with life. But sometimes they were bad: “Dead Head,” druggie, incense-burner, hippie. Senior Hannah Harrell says you know times have really changed when you go to the library and the guy coming out is wearing a t-shirt that’s almost as loud as his Polo cologne is strong. The images seem somehow incongruent, like the “southern gentlemen” of Kappa Alpha playing Grateful Dead at their parties.

According to senior David Ordoubadian, some of the people who have been wearing tie-dyes for years have packed them up until the fad blows over. Senior Caroline Hoffman says that she doesn’t wear the friendship bracelet she has because “everyone else has one.” The trend has created a whole new breed of tie-dyers, introducing what sophomore Curt Perkins calls the “weekend tie-dyers” or “party tie-dyers” who are trying “to achieve a unique fashion statement not surpassed by a computer-generated one.”

Like many of the students who were abroad last year, Hoffman was surprised to see so many tie-dyes when she returned to Davidson. Harrell, who was with Hoffman in Germany last year, says their freshman year was different because “the few people wearing pony-tails and tie-dyes really stood out and had more in common. You can’t associate the clothing with a type of person anymore.”

Although the fashions have embraced a Sixties dress, students say that there’s no real revival of the Sixties attitude. “It’s cute,” says Hoffman, “but there’s not very much depth to it.” Ordoubadian says, “Wearing tie-dyes used to represent people who were willing to break from the mainstream. It used to be if you saw someone with a tie-dye he was a Dead Head (listened to the Grateful Dead) and that theme implied a lot; people assumed a lot.”

It’s good that the styles don’t have to be associated with drugs anymore, Harrell says, but “sad for the people who might want to make a difference in the way they dress.” She remembers those who wore tie-dyes as being very “laid-back,” but also concerned about social issues and faithful to Amnesty International. Four years ago, the small, struggling club averaged about 5 or 6 members at its meetings. This year, Amnesty seems almost as popular as the tie-dyes, as early meetings have averaged 50-60 people.

Ordoubadian says that the popular “new” look and the interest in Amnesty slide right in with the times. “You see it among a lot of the music world, which is really going back to the Sixties feel in their interests and way they dress. Everyone is turning to the Sixties or the image of the hippies.”

ROOMIE, from page 4

...hear the confessions—but no longer—you’ve heard them all before. And sometimes you beg God to make your living partner bald so you won’t ever have to pull hair out of the sink (or your carpet) again. All this and more can be yours if you go about dorm-life in error. Face it, you’ve got to share your student, so you may as well like him. Not all rules work for all roommates, but the following are some hints to help get you through the rough times (e.g. when you're walking up and down the hall in a towel looking for a master key):

1) Use codes. A lot of roommates simply have trouble because of a lack of timing and observational skills. For instance, when you finally get the best-looking guy in your class to come over to help you with your biology homework, the last thing you want is your beloved roommate to come in...and share the experience. Any previously agreed upon sign left on the door (a big “X” on the memo board, string tied around the doorknob, or in a real emergency—taping up a sexy black and white Calvin Klein ad) will save you frustration and discord. Codes also work well at parties. A slight wave or triple-sneeze (depending on your acting skills) can mean, “I am bored to death, come get me out of this conversation.” Make sure your roomie notices and you’re as good as saved.

2) Always cover for your roommate. There are just seven simple words to remember when your roommate is partying on the Court and the parents call, “I think (fill-in roommate’s name here) is at the library.” You probably owe your roommate a favor anyway for using a code at the last party.

3) Always take phone messages from the opposite sex. Absolutely, positively, always “take a message” when someone calls your roommate and she is not around. But whatever you do, if it’s a guy, get his name and number. If she comes back and you say, “Someone called for you, but I forgot to get his name,” she’s going to be annoyed. You’re messing with her social life. Few roommates can overcome a blow like this—so don’t let it happen.

4) Only sign up for classes that meet at different times. No matter how well you get along with your roommate, you probably see too much of him. At college, time alone is rare, but essential. The only thing worse than scheduling your classes together is signing up for the same classes. Both are definite “no-no’s.” You’ll never have the room to yourself (and have to abuse hint #1) and you will walk everywhere together; classes, post office, the Court. But worst of all, you will be expected to share your sink at the same time. Either change your roommate or change your major, but don’t schedule your classes at the same time.

5) Be blatantly honest from the beginning. Don’t lie to avoid “hurting your roommate’s feelings.” If you’re not interested in her album containing pictures of all the children she ever baby-sat, tell her. Your true feelings will only come out later when she brings it out for the 26th time to show you her all-time favorite child. In your frustration, you'll probably say something like, “That’s the ugliest little brat I’ve ever seen,” and cause more problems than you would have with the honest approach.

6) Don’t be “too good.” This is a lot like being honest. This hint merely states that you are allowed to be yourself. You can leave your light on to study, hit the snooze bar on your alarm clock at least five times before getting up, and listen to whatever music suits you. Be thoughtful, but be comfortable. Gummy snakes in your roommate’s bed are not only permissible but highly recommended.

7) Ignore a lot. Although this is one of the most general of all the hints, it is also one of the most important. A “subhint” would probably be “Give your roommate the benefit of the doubt.” When your roommate eats the last piece of pizza in the refrigerator (and you’ve been looking forward to it all day), go on with your life. “Don’t worry, be happy.” If it still bothers you, tell yourself that she was probably thinking about that pizza for two days. You, therefore, would have done her harm if you had eaten the last slice.

8) Have a sense of humor. What more is there to say? There were actually 10 hints, but “Consistently complain about your schedule” and “Shop for your own groceries” were deleted—just follow them out of faith. The article is already too long and they weren’t as funny as the rest anyway.
