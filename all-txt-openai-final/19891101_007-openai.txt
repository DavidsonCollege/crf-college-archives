**Charlotte Knights to move to Davidson?**

**By GIGGY MAXWELL**

In a couple of weeks, we will be celebrating the opening of the new Baker Sports Complex, the superstructure that is supposed to send Davidson athletics hurtling into the 21st century. If you have seen the plans for the building or had a chance to tour it, it’s hard to deny that the Complex is anything less than incredible. But is it practical?

For the Davidson baseball team, and both soccer teams, the answer is no. These three programs play and practice in the most remote areas of the campus and, for them, the Baker Sports Complex will actually become a nuisance.

Now the locker room facilities for these teams will be located even further from their playing fields, which means more time devoted to just getting to and from practice on a daily basis. Equipment will have to be lugged a greater distance as well. While every other sport enjoys the modern confines of the Baker Sports Complex, baseball and soccer will continue to pack fans onto pre-World War II stands that have already proven dangerous (one fan actually fell through the bleachers last year). The baseball and soccer press box will continue to consist of a table and refreshments will continue to be served out of an Igloo Cooler.

These programs have had a good amount of success, yet they still have facilities which are way below par in terms of what the teams they compete against have to offer. The bottom line is that these programs need their own facilities closer to their playing fields.

But building such facilities from scratch would be both expensive and impractical. The Charlotte Knights AA baseball team has the answer for us.

Two years ago, George Shinn, also owner of the Charlotte Hornets, purchased the then Charlotte O’s from the Crockett family. Crockett Park, which had previously housed the O’s, had just recently burned to the ground. Upon purchasing the team, Shinn decided to move the team to Gold Hills, South Carolina to a 10,000-seat multipurpose stadium that he was constructing. Since this new ballpark would not be functional in time for the 1989 season, a temporary facility was built. Now the renamed Knights are ready to move into their new stadium and the Knights' brass is looking to unload their temporary facilities at much less than the original cost.

Men’s soccer coach Charlie Slagle and baseball coach Jim Stoeckel have been working with a group of alumni who are a part of the Davidson Baseball Interest Group in an effort to obtain some, or all, of these facilities for the college.

Exactly what do these facilities consist of?

- Seating for 4,000 persons
- A press box area
- Both home and visitors clubhouses
- Shower facilities
- A training area
- Laundry facilities
- Coaches' offices
- Bathrooms for men and women spectators
- Storage areas
- Lighting
- 2 portable concession stands

These are by no means expensive buildings but they would be very functional for the aforementioned teams and, according to initial surveys, would fit well into the Davidson surroundings.

“Not only will these facilities help out the baseball, soccer, and golf programs,” reasoned Coach Stoeckel, “but the student body as a whole will benefit in a number of ways: We'll be able to provide a more pleasant setting for fans to watch a game; the outdoor IMAC activities will have storage space that is much closer to their playing fields; having bathroom facilities out there will be of great benefit to spectators, golfers, and IMAC athletes alike.”

If Davidson (that includes you, the student) decides it does want to purchase some or all of these facilities, it has to do so soon and make the Knights an offer to start the ball rolling. Initial talks with Davidson higher-ups have been positive in this regard and more specific details should be forthcoming in the next few weeks.

“You've got to remember,” added Stoeckel, “we're not talking about a $2.5 million-dollar stadium like Wake Forest has, and we’re not asking for a replica of the Toronto Blue Jays Sky Dome. We just feel that purchasing these facilities would go a long way to completing what the Baker Sports Complex has started in updating and making Davidson sports facilities some of the nicest there are for a school this size.”

**Flickerball’s round one full of upsets**

**By QUINN McCUTCHEN**

The regular seasons for indoor soccer and flickerball are over and the post-season tournaments are underway. The first round of flickerball began last Sunday. There were many surprises and close games as the top sixteen teams battled for eight spots in the double elimination winners’ bracket.

The top-seeded Just Average Guys prevailed 36-18 despite a gallant effort by 2nd West Belk. KA Gold was edged 19-18 by the Blue Dogs in an exciting game. 3rd Beast suppressed two-minute drives by Those Meddling Kids to hang on to a 20-18 victory and become the lone freshman team left in the tournament. R.A.S.H. remained undefeated by stopping Delta Force 32-26 while D-F.W-B won the hard way, claiming a forfeit over the mysteriously absent Mystery Machine. The Flickergods ruled the Pack 38-7 and Drop and Give outscored We are Thrice Yea 30-23.

In women’s flickerball, the Insatiables defeated Down the Hall by a large margin. Other women’s games were slated to start Monday. Next week, more flickerball and indoor soccer results.
