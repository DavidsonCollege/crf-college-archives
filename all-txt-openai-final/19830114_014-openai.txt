**Workshops Return With Vigor**

*and they leave us with questions.*

**BY STEPHANIE BRUCK ’84**

Questions were answered and questions were raised last week as the studio theatre season opened. Karen Baldwin directed Suzann Smith and Roy Fuller in answering Louis Catron’s question *Where Have All the Lightning Bugs Gone?*. A boy who shuns reading draws a bookwormish girl out of her books and into living a series of role-playing games. In each successive role, they hide a little less of themselves until they are at ease talking and trusting. The couple is separated by war, but the oasis reality they created lives on with the girl as she carries off the boy’s balloon, leaving her books.

Karen chose the play because, she said, it sketches “a sensitive, beautiful relationship in a menacing world.” She gave much of the credit for the play’s quick pace to her actors, who worked hard on their lines. Karen edited this 1972 play, taking out some of the heavy-handed references to the Vietnam war, in order to keep the script from seeming dated and “to give it a new light.”

The relationship developed in the play shows the audience the necessity of creating one’s own beauty in a world where ugliness surrounds one. The actors bring across well the possibility of nurturing one’s own beautiful, though fragile, world. One feels at the end of the play a strong sense of not only the possibility, but the necessity of creating a private realm to combat despair in the world.

*The Loveliest Afternoon of the Year* does not answer any questions; rather, it raises them. With the aid of good make-up artistry, Loy Thornton and Pat Donley play two people in their sixties. Meeting in a park on Sundays, the couple develops a sympathetic relationship. The man tells outrageous tales about his cruel wife and her blue perambulator. Then one Sunday the man declares his feelings for his park-companion, and just then, his hideous wife shows up and shoots the couple with her blue perambulator.

In staging, director Doug Vass faced the problem of overcoming cliché. An absurdist comedy, *Loveliest Afternoon* was first produced in 1966 when absurdism was still avant-garde. However, like other innovations, absurdism has become an established style today. Doug liked this John Guare play but chose to change the age of the two main characters from around twenty to over sixty in order to “make the plot less glib while retaining its absurd nature.” Doug had much praise for his actors and his production staff. “I felt the audience enjoyed the play,” Doug said, “yet it made them think a little at the same time.”

The great difficulty for actors and audience in interpreting absurdism is that it challenges the traditional order of theatre: the order of question and resolution portrayed by imitating life. It is in fact an emotional experience rather than a rational one, and the success of this production resulted from the charged atmosphere that the play created, which sparked enthusiastic approval from the audience.

Be sure to catch tonight’s workshop offerings, *Next* and *The Insanity of Mary Girard*, and next week’s, Ionesco’s *The Lesson* and Sartre’s *No Exit*.

Prof. Clough’s lecture quite clearly dealt with one particular facet of art history — that which deals with the history of particular works rather than with how they exemplify the trends of a particular period. It is the latter approach which is emphasized understandably by art history courses at Davidson. This lecture was interesting to me as a history major concentrating on England, and as someone avidly interested in such residues of the British aristocracy as the peerage and orders of chivalry.

However, Prof. Clough’s lecture was technical and specialized enough to elicit apologies from a faculty member who had all but specifically required his class to attend. It is probable that Prof. Clough’s lecture would have been appreciated more by a group of professional art historians than by students less familiar with the more technical areas of the field.

The diptych, due to its small size, was likely commissioned by a fellow della Rovere relative of Urbino to ornament a private study. The much larger “Washington panel” of St. George is stated by some authorities to have been a gift of Duke Guidobaldo to King Henry VII of England. However, this work is known to have been in the possession of the Earls of Shrewsbury and subsequently of the Earls of Pembroke. Prof. Clough suggested that the Washington Panel was a gift not to King Henry, but to Sir Gilbert Talbot, the Garter Knight who went to invest Guidobaldo with the insignia of the order. Sir Gilbert was the second son of the second Earl of Shrewsbury, and it is most probable that the panel passed to the fourth Earl after Gilbert’s son died without issue. When the seventh Earl died without a male heir, the panel would naturally have passed to his son-in-law, the third Earl of Pembroke.
