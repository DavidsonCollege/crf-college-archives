### THE DAVIDSONIAN WEDNESDAY, APRIL 23, 2008

#### Tennis places runner-up in SoCon, hopes for bid
By MIKE FRONGELLO, Sports Editor

The women’s tennis team began last weekend’s SoCon Tournament with dreams of becoming the first Wildcat team to win a Southern Conference tennis championship. The 'Cats played inspired tennis for three days as they notched wins over Wofford and College of Charleston before coming up just short in their historic bid. Furman captured the conference title for the fifth consecutive year with a 4-0 win over the Wildcats on Sunday at the Earle Tennis Center on the campus of The Citadel in Charleston, S.C.

Davidson began their tournament run with sixth-seeded Wofford on Friday afternoon. The 'Cats defeated Wofford 6-1 in their only regular season meeting on April 11 and this match proved to be no different as the Wildcats secured the 4-0 victory. In doubles play, the team of Kelsey Linville '08 and Virginia Berry '10 as well as the team of Michelle Fanney '09 and Teresa Wang '10 recorded wins to give the 'Cats an early 1-0 lead in the match. The strong doubles performance carried over into singles play as Davidson’s top three-seeded players coasted to victories. Linville earned a 6-0, 6-2 win while Berry defeated her opponent 6-2, 6-2. Fanney clinched the match victory over the Terriers with a 6-3, 6-1 victory over Wofford’s Sabrina Smyers at No. 3.

With the win, the third-seeded 'Cats advanced to a Saturday showdown with second-seeded College of Charleston in the semifinals. The Cougars had narrowly won the team’s lone regular season meeting on March 30, 4-3, but the Lady Wildcats were poised to avenge that regular season loss. In doubles competition, Linville and Berry fell 8-4 in the opener, but the Wildcats won the doubles point with victories by the teams of Fanney and Wang and also Kim Whelan '09 and Alison Rauh '11. Fanney and Wang secured the doubles point and the early 1-0 lead with an 8-6 win over Charleston’s Holly Dowse and Keely Mulligan. The Cougars took the lead with singles wins at No. 2 and No. 3, but Linville evened the score at 2-2 with a 6-4, 7-6 victory over Chelsea Albertz at No. 1. Whelan defeated Dowse at No. 4, 6-4, 6-4 to give the lead back to the 'Cats. Then Meredith Skeeters '08 clinched Davidson’s place in the tournament final with a hard-fought 7-6, 3-6, 6-4 triumph over Anna Lee Evans at No. 5.

On Sunday, the lady Wildcats faced a stern test in nationally-ranked Furman. The Paladins entered the match with an 18-5 record, including a perfect 11-0 in SoCon play. In their last regular season match on April 12, the 'Cats suffered a 7-0 setback to Furman and again they were no match for the Paladins. Furman swept the doubles point, although Linville and Berry narrowly missed a victory in a tough 9-7 loss, as Davidson fell behind early 1-0. The 'Cats were obviously fatigued from Saturday’s emotional victory and it showed in singles play. The Paladins recorded straight set wins at No. 1, No. 2, and No. 4 to clinch their fifth consecutive Southern Conference Championship. The Wildcats have been Furman’s victim in the final match of the season three out of the last four years.

Now Davidson’s postseason fate is in the hands of the NCAA Selection Committee. After tournament play, the 'Cats’ record stands at an impressive 19-6, including a third place regular season conference finish with a 7-2 SoCon campaign. The 2008 NCAA Division I Women’s Tennis Tournament field will be announced on April 29 at 2 p.m. on ESPNews.

If this was indeed the 'Cats final match, seniors Linville and Skeeters capped off their careers with stellar senior seasons. Linville finished the season with a 14-9 record, including a 2-1 record in SoCon Tournament play. In addition, Linville was named First Team All-Conference prior to the tournament. Skeeters capped a 15-4 senior campaign with a solid performance at the SoCon tournament as she finishes her four-year career with a 45-21 record. More impressively, Skeeters was named this year’s winner of...the SoCon Sportsmanship Award earlier in the week. Sophomore Virginia Berry was also honored as she was voted to the All-SoCon second team.

The first home meet in three years for Davidson's Track and Field team was held on Saturday afternoon. The Irwin Belk Invitational proved to be a memorable, record-breaking competition, as both men and women impressed at Davidson's Senior Day.

Megal Atias ’08 won the 2000-meter steeplechase with a time of 7:18.61.

Player of the Week — Meredith Skeeters ‘08
Women’s Tennis
Hometown: Greensboro, N.C.

Last week Skeeters was named the SoCon Sportsmanship Award winner for women's tennis. In addition to being a good sport, Skeeters turned in an impressive senior season with a 15-3 overall record in singles play.

For the men, Beaux Jones '08 set a new school record with a winning throw in the javelin. Jones broke his own record that was set last week at the Tony Waldrop Invitational in Chapel Hill; his throw in front of the hometown crowd flew 194 feet 10 inches (59.39 meters).

“The solid turnout rallied us to produce lots of personal bests, and we hope to carry that momentum into the SoCon Championships.” Alex Hoyt ’09

Will Funderburg ’09 joined Jones on top of the leaderboard of field events with a first-place throw in the shot put. His winning throw measured 51 feet 1 inch (15.57 meters). He also placed second in the discus event with a throw of 139 feet 8 inches (42.57 meters).

In the mid-distance track events, Peter Bruton ’10 won the 1500 meters with a time of 3:58.49. Close on his heels, Alex Hoyt ’09 finished second with a time of 4:00.24. In the sprinting events, Melaku Teka ’11 and Brad Troxell ’08 finished second and third in the 800 meters, respectively, with times of 1:56.15 and 1:56.25. In the 100 meter dash, Kwame Som-Pimpong ’09 finished fourth overall with a time of 11.45. In the 4x100 meter relay, the combination of Som-Pimpong, Bryce Jones ’11, Will Ames ’11, and Ethan Dunn ’11 took first place with a time of 44.76.

“Peter Bruton had a huge win in the 1500. His time qualifies him for the fast section at Conference, where he’ll try to manage the difficult triple of the 800, the 1500, and the 4x400,” Hoyt said.

“Peter Bruton looked really good,” Katherine Miller ’10 said.

The women's team posted equally impressive results. Megal Atias ’08 won the 2000-meter steeplechase, the event in which she secured a school record last weekend at UNC, with a time of 7:18.61.

“It was inspirational,” excitable observer Neely Meeks ’09 said.

Brenna Burns ’08 also placed first in her distance event, winning the 3000 meters with a time of 10:14.47. Emily King ’08 finished just behind Burns in the 3000-meter event to place fourth with a time of 10:38.33. In the sprinting events, Amaka Obidegwu ’08 made Senior Day memorable when she finished eighth in the 400 meters with a time of 59.68. Kim Colley ’09 placed ninth in the 200 meters with a time of 26.02. Colleen McKown ’08 and Sarah Cline ’11 finished fifth and sixth in the 1500 meters with times of 5:00.71 and 5:01.71, respectively. McKown also earned a 10th-place finish in the 800 meters with a time of 2:27.45. Kenesia Martin ’09 finished seventh in the triple jump with a leap measuring 36 feet 8 1/2 inches (11.19 meters).

“The solid turnout rallied us to produce lots of personal bests, and we hope to carry that momentum into the SoCon Championships,” Hoyt said.

Both teams will prepare for the SoCon Outdoor Championships held at Western Carolina next weekend.

Double Play Preserves ’Cats Win Over Ga. Southern

With base runners on first and third base with one out in the ninth and the ’Cats nursing a 7-6 lead over conference foe Georgia Southern, relief pitcher Matt Webb ’08 faced the Eagles’ Chris Sheehan. Sheehan hit a ground ball up the middle, but Webb got just enough of it to keep it in the infield as Zach Kayne ’09 and Chris Fitzpatrick ’09 turned the double play to secure the SoCon win.
