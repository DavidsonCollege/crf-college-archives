**Things Can Only Get Better**

Last Friday night showed just how radically different Davidson’s social atmosphere has already become, after just one frustrating and confusing
week under the new alcohol policy. As a member of the Davidsonian editorial board sat holding a Busch Light on
a couch inside of Kappa Sigma, a Davidson police officer approached and then asked the subject to, “Please step outside.”
Having turned the seemingly legal age of 21 months ago, our subject was excited about the prospect of proudly displaying
an I.D. to prove that he was indeed ‘of age.’ He was soon shocked to learn that nonetheless he was
receiving an alcohol violation, for simply drinking beer from a can. Apparently, the new alcohol policy has a provision stating
that all beer must be in a cup, no matter your age. What made the violation even more confusing was
that twenty minutes earlier at Kappa Alpha he had been told by a different officer that it was fine to
have a can.

We suppose that the violator could be blamed for not knowing the intricacies of the new policy (ignorance is no
excuse in the face of the law and all that), but he really shouldn’t have to accept the entire blame.
Everyone will agree, even the confused officers, that the explosion of rules, provisions, and guidelines has left practically everyone bewildered.
This incident Friday night raised a lot of questions and highlighted the problem that nobody, not even the officers or
monitors, knows exactly what this damn thing is trying to accomplish, or let alone how the policy is to be
enforced. As it was interpreted this past week it appears as if this policy is attempting to almost totally abolish
any form of drinking on the Davidson campus. That was definitely not the original intent of this policy, but in
practice it seems to have taken this wrong and potentially socially-devastating turn. Is forced abstinence the best policy?

Sadly, the first week's court parties have left upperclassmen reminiscing about the “good-old-days” and have shown that things actually are
a lot different down there. Many students seem to have adopted the attitude that our school is going to hell
in a hand basket, or at least a suitcase on the weekends. Let us stop right here to explain that
the change we are talking about is not concentrated on the availability of alcohol. We are talking about atmosphere. The
relaxed, engaging atmosphere of Patterson Court parties has always been an attractive and unique part of Davidson. After visiting friends
at other colleges and universities, it was clear that the parties at Davidson were superior. Students from other schools have
commented how much more intimate, open, and plain fun the parties are (or, rather, used to be) at Davidson. They
are amazed that Davidson students actually dance! This atmosphere has been largely changed by the influx of rules and more
rules.

Perhaps we are simply being prematurely pessimistic and things will revert back to normal after everyone adjusts. Still, we are
hopeful that the administration will acknowledge the change in atmosphere and be willing to take steps to maintain the vitality
of the Court. We are confident that changes can be made which would ease the tension, without threatening the intended
objectives of the new policy. We can only hope that the administration will realize the importance of getting this mess
straightened out. Whether or not we want to admit it, students often choose colleges because of the social environment.

So where should we begin looking for changes? The 12:30 (weekdays) and 1:30 (weekends) time restraints seem to be the
biggest and most ridiculous culprits. Although these rules were intended to keep students from sleeping past classes, the simple fact
is that Davidson students are not ready to go to bed after 12:30. We are used to being able to
study until 11:30 while looking forward to going down on the court after our work is done. What will happen
now is one of two things: students will simply begin partying soon after dinner (as many did last week) and
sacrifice the night’s study time or students will approach Patterson Court parties as only the first thing to do before
jumping in a car and going elsewhere. Obviously, neither are attractive options. With the new policy, the only ones who
can legally drink anyway are Seniors and a few Juniors. After being at Davidson awhile, most students have generally learned
how to budget their own time and that it pays to show up for class in the morning.

One other concern: at one time we were told that there would be no limit as to how late people
could stay and dance. Last Friday night, however, the party had to end at 2 a.m. because monitors had to
be there, and the monitors were calling it a night. Does it make any sense to have a rule that
prohibits college students from dancing as late as they want?

Believe it or not, we are still generally hopeful and positive about the new policy. The vast majority of the
new reforms are fair and appropriate. They should effectively put an end to fighting and abusive drinking at parties. Still,
let’s not stop looking for improvements. We need to go back and look at ways to bring back some of
the old atmosphere into our new, heavily regulated environment.structured parties. The administration was completely open to ideas and suggestions last
spring and they should be equally as open to student recommendations for improvements to the policy this fall. Trial and
error will solve some of the problems, but that could take months. Things need to happen more quickly than that,
especially before freshmen are introduced to ‘wet’ parties on the court. Until this policy is fully understood, correctly implemented and
begins to work smoothly, just be patient and plead ignorance.

Spencer President Announces House's Demise

To the Editor:

Due to financial difficulties and the decision of our members, Spencer House has chosen not to remain open for the
fall of 1992. We wish to thank Dr. Dave Martin for his continuous kindness, assistance, and enthusiasm, and we appreciate
Dean Terry’s support. Spencer House has enjoyed and contributed to seven years of Patterson Court, and we are saddened to
realize that this time has ended. Nevertheless, the women of Spencer House meet this transition looking forward to continued and
expanded participation in the life of Davidson College.

Sincerely,
Zama Neff

Beyond Birkenstock:
Seth J. McLaughlin & J. Kyle Kinner

We'd like to take this opportunity to welcome the class of '96 to their first year here at Davidson. Over
the course of the next few months, you’ll be endlessly bombarded with various trivialities, including those nuggets of wisdom your
professors dole out in class. But don’t be fooled, within two years of graduation you will have forgotten all that
useless penumbra anyway. So don’t work so hard on what will ultimately prove to be unimportant, read Beyond Birkenstock instead.
We have taken it as our civic and Davidsonian duty to instruct you in the truly critical life-skills. And our
first lesson is important, so pay attention: Seniors Are Not Gods. While we are mythical beings with nearly limitless power,
we can’t actually move planets out of orbit or crap like that. But you must still give seniors the respect
and awe that near-omnipotence inspires.

In fact, being a senior really has its disadvantages. Definitely... enjoy all the freedoms that being a freshperson has to
offer. For instance, the Birks live in an apartment—a SENIOR APARTMENT. Let us assure you, the livin’ here is far
from easy. Sometimes it takes us ten or fifteen minutes to decide which channel to watch on TV, there’s so
much to watch on CABLE. And do you know, after a scant six days the light has burned out on
our spacious PATIO. Man, the trials we put up with. And having a private bedroom... well, you guys know from
home how lonely your own room is; we’ve had to invite countless women up here every night just to keep
us from succumbing to the ravages of ennui. No, this APARTMENT is a sacrifice that we as upperclasspersons have agreed
to bear so that you underclasspersons will not have to face such terrible challenges at such a tender age. Consider
it our collective gift to you. We wouldn’t have it any other way. The blessings of dorm life are our
way of saying... hey, welcome to Davidson. So sit back in your dorm rooms (probably on your beds unless you’ve
built a loft), adjust the rabbit ears on your TV, enjoy a nice, cold, non-alcoholic beverage, and pen your thank-you
note to the Class of ’93, care of Laura Cunningham, our class Prez (and jogger extraordinaire).

A few final thoughts to carry you through this Monday evening (or Tuesday, if the paper’s late). Don’t be afraid
to complain. After all, many of you are paying close to TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS, EACH AND EVERY YEAR FOR FOUR
YEARS. While the college did indeed do you a favor by letting you in, now that you're here they NEED
