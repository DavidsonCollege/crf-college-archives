**Cats Rally By Rugged Bulldogs, 73-69**

If someone had looked into the Citadel locker room before their game with Davidson, it would not be surprising to
see their players running full speed into the walls. This is how the Citadel played Saturday and it was all
the Cats could do to salvage a 73-69 victory.

The young Bulldogs came out scrapping, with a full court press that caused many early turnovers and gave them a
five-point lead, 8-3. From then on, Davidson’s class showed as they did not fold as many other teams had done
in Charleston. Citadel’s record at home was a surprising 8-1 before the game. Although the crowd was small (less than
2,000) and not right on the court as in some other gyms, it was soon apparent why the Bulldogs were
so successful at home.

In the early going, it was apparent that the game was going to be rough as Larry Horowitz was undercut
on two drives. Neither of these two incidents were called fouls. The referees seemed to ignore flagrant incidental contact on
both sides and missed some friendly gestures. One of these was a game of elbows by Arthur McGriff and Horowitz
which ended in McGriff's attempt to punt the Wildcat forward.

Horowitz started off fast for the Wildcats. After about four minutes of play, there was a steady chant of "Horowitz"
from the Citadel rooting section whenever Larry was in the game. Paul Wagner also played a strong game and was
the recipient of some name-calling by the raucous Bulldog fans. He also was the victim of some bad calls and
non-calls. When Wagner first entered the game, he put his hand on the back of his man and was immediately
called for the foul as the refs tried to regain some measure of control. Later, he got a rebound under
his own basket and was all but castrated trying to take the ball back up while one referee called a
jump ball only to be overruled by a traveling call.

The lead went back and forth in the very physical first half, while the Cats struggled to manage a tie.
Davidson’s biggest lead in the second half was seven points and this margin did not occur until the last minute.

the girls journeyed to Pfeiffer to play one regularly scheduled game, and to settle some unfinished business from an earlier

**Wolfpack Tops Cats As Little Men Shine**

By MARK WILENSKY
Sports Editor

For the second straight year, Davidson managed to control David Thompson, and for the second straight year, the Wolfpack of
N.C. State has come away with a lopsided victory over the Cats. Strong defense by Greg Dunn and a tight
zone defense in the first half kept Thompson under control, but his teammates were equal to the task as the
nation’s number two ranked team breezed by Davidson, 105-78.

The Cats jumped off to a 2-0 lead, but after that, the outcome was never in doubt. Led by River's
24 points, the Wolfpack were clearly dominant. State shot an unbelievable 67 percent from the floor in the first half.
Very few of their 50 first-half points came from in close, as Rivers, Thompson, and Monte Towe banged away.Half was
also a nip and tuck battle with no one gaining a definite advantage. With the score tied at 62 and
the crowd still yelling Horowitz, the Cats ran seven straight points to put the game basically out of reach. The
Cats eventually won the game 73-69 and will certainly take this victory. The jayvees got back on track with a
win over the Bullpups. Most of the field goals for Davidson came from the big men as it seemed that
layups were frequent when the Cats broke the press. The guys who handle the ball (Sorrentino, Powell, Dunn, and Falconi)
had a rough time from the field. They were shaken by the Citadel's physical defense and managed only six for
23 from the field with only Falconi hitting 50%. This group was also fouled often as they were 17 for
23 at the line. Overall, the Cats shot 44% from the field and were 27 for 36 from the charity
stripe. Horowitz led all the Davidson scorers with 16 points and was followed by Wagner with 12. Greg Dunn and
Sheldon Parker each had 10 while Mike

from the perimeter. Trying to compensate for a distinct height advantage, Davidson stayed in a tight zone defense for most
of the first half. The Cats challenged the Pack to hit from the outside and the Pack did just that.
Towe was seven-of-seven from the field and had 15 points while Rivers hit five of eight for 12. Towe in
particular was devastating, as he dropped in his wind-up jump shot consistently from beyond 20 feet. State began the game
shooting from the outside and hoping to pull the Cats out of their zone to allow Thompson and Tommy Burleson
to work inside. The Cats refused to come out, so Towe, Rivers, Thompson, and even Burleson popped relatively freely from
15 to 25 feet. The pattern in the second half changed but the story remained the same. The Cats

The Citadel was paced by their flashy freshman guard Rodney McKeever who had 13 points and eight assists. Chuck Cordell
and Jerry Colis each had 12. Davidson is still third in the Conference but second place Richmond plays at the
Citadel this Saturday in what should be a very tough contest.

came out of the zone, so State worked inside. Working the ball first in to Thompson or Burleson and then
back out to Spence, Stoddard, and Rivers driving in, State maintained their dominance. Sheldon Parker played well against Burleson, holding
him to 13 points and seven rebounds, with all of the points and most of the rebounds coming in the
second half. Burleson was in foul trouble early, but Steve Nuce did a good board job in his place. The
Cats seemed reluctant to take some wide-open 15-foot jump shots. John Falconi and Larry Horowitz in particular passed up some
open shots to drive on the hoop and often found their close-range shots rejected by State's big front line. Greg
Dunn had nineteen points despite numerous blocked shots and some real banging around. Mike Sorrentino continued to be consistent from
the outside and Paul Wagner did another fine rebounding job after coming off the bench. The Wildcats close out their
Johnston Gym schedule when they meet East Carolina, second in the Southern Conference, Saturday night. That will be the last
appearance in Johnston Gym for Mike Sorrentino, T.J. Pecorak, John Falconi, Paul Wagner, Bob Vandergriend, and mascot Dave Bender.
