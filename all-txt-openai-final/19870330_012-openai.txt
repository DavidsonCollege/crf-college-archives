SCHOOL OF MEDICINE
Affiliated Hospitals in New York State
GRENADA
ST. VINCENT
United Kingdom

Approved February 4, 1987 by the New York State Education Department for the purpose of conducting a clinical clerkship program
in New York teaching hospitals.

St. George’s received a similar approval in 1985 from the New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners; this establishes St. George’s
as the only foreign medical school with instruction in English that has state-approved campuses in both New York and New
Jersey.

Over 700 students have transferred to U.S. medical schools. St. George’s has graduated over 1,000 physicians:
They are licensed in 39 states;
They hold faculty positions in 20 U.S. medical schools — 25% have been Chief Residents in 119 U.S. hospitals (according
to a 1986 survey).

St. George’s is entering its second decade of medical education. In the first decade, we were cited by The Journal
of the American Medical Association (January, 1985) as ranking number one of all major foreign medical schools in the initial
pass rate on the ECFMG exam.

St. George’s is one of the few foreign medical schools whose students qualify for Guaranteed Student Loans. Our students also
qualify for the PLUS/ALAS loans and, under certain conditions, VA loans. St. George’s grants a limited number of loans and
scholarships to entering students.
