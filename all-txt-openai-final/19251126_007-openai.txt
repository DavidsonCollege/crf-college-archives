While the mass of the students clamored out of the picture show Saturday night crying for their quarters, ill-spent on the “Beggar On Horseback,” the intelligentsia of the college nodded cynical smiles of approval over what seemed to them one of the best pictures ever shown at Davidson. However, far from approbation were the words of one of the highest literary elites, H. L. Shaw, Jr., editor of the Quips and Cranks. At the show, backed by a sympathetic crowd in the student store that drove the writer into a position psychologically (but not commonsensically) known as “defense complex.” Up in the historic Georgia building, famed as the student abode of such men as Galloway, Davis, Mellwaine and Gallent, the critic fled to find it divided on this topic. R. W. Graves, literary editor of the Annual, said, “It fulfilled the purpose for which I go to the movies—diversion unusual and different from general trend of pictures.” One door down the hall Warren G. Ogden, Caps and Bells editor, spoke words of wisdom: “The plot was bizarre, the girl approached a wonderful beauty and it would have been a real picture had there been an actor playing the leading role.” The descent into one flight below the play was bitterly criticized, under the materialistic outlook of the business manager of the Magazine, Wilson, saying that the only good he got out of it was the idea of having a football player attached to his pants. Mitchell, football player and military officer, spoke admiringly of the dream in the show, but “outside of that it was a piece of foolishness.” Hamp Lawson, another member of the Magazine staff, differed from his associates, saying, “I liked it very much; it was at least unusual, I don't mean this for publication.” “Certainly a welcome variation from the thirty-second clinch ending type, I enjoyed it although I do not think it much to rave about,” was the droll reply given out by another member of the Magazine staff, Wood Brown. Two days later, C. F. Monk, as he dried its fresh ink over a flaming fire, spoke in tones of approval. “Novel” and “interesting” were several of the adjectives used, and G. B. Shaddock, staff word of criticism, would venture none.A certain Monday morning class was beginning. Soldier and poet seemed to join hands as George Smith, military officer, echoed the sentiments of Shaddoeck in oaths that seemed to smack of “What Price Glory.” Then came The Davidsonian Staff Branch calling the show to an extreme—but only one member, and that word was “rotten.” Fred Smith, editor of said publication, poet renown, playwright himself, encouraged the criticism by saying, “I think the show was excellent, perhaps bizarre and unusual; but who wants the old cut-and-dried, drum society-sex stuff all the time. The best interpretation of a dream I've ever seen.” 

No criticism is complete without a word from the box office. “Frankly I was disappointed in it,” spoke Mr. Garrison, manager of the student theater, but then with an O. Henry-like comeback, he added, “disappointed with the attitude of the boys toward it.”

NEW HANDBALL COURTS

The handball court, which has been under construction for the past few days, is to be completed by the end of this week, according to present plans. This court will be used by the boxing team a great deal because the game of handball, while simple, is one of the best for developing quickness of eye and foot. Captain Elkins wants it to be distinctly understood that this court is not to be simply the property of the boxers, but of every student on the campus. Handball courts are not limited to exact dimensions, the only requirement being that there is room enough. This particular court will accommodate easily four men, or two teams. A large backboard will be placed at each end and serving lines marked out. A volleyball court will also be completed this week and another next week. These three courts will provide room for many more students to get in some exercise. Captain Elkins is to be commended for his efforts in this line, for these improvements have been obtained largely through his enthusiasm.
