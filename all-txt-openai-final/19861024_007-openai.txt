Every Anonymous Sophomore

These fragments I have shored against my ruins You must understand
Why then Ile fit you. Hieronymo's mad againe.
Datta. Dayadvam. Damyata. I am the center of the moral universe
Shantih shantih shantih.
T.S. Eliot

I don’t have to explain —
But I carry the pain of others, as the Bermuda Triangle carries the sunken mystery of the missing.

I see with my eyes
I hear with my ears
I mean it’s this way
I burn incense not for any gods
But for my nose
It's nice

You see, I’m the center of this soft room
In the center of your hard world

We whisper into black holes that we have asses ears;
A dogwood springs up and whispers coolly into the blistering wind,
Humanity has asses ears . . . Humanity has asses ears . . . Humanity has . . .

over and over and I think
It speaks to me alone.

Just me

Eunice M. Hiott '87

It all comes back to me
