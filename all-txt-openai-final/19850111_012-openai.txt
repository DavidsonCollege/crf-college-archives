Strange, But True, Predictions For 1985!

By CRAIG DETWEILER and KEITH EVANS

Just in case you missed Jeane Dixon and The National Enquirer’s predictions for 1985, we have taken it upon ourselves to make sure that you’ll know what’s coming up in the New Year. As seniors, we feel obligated to let Davidson underclassmen “in” on the trends that will once again raise their ugly little heads. In undertaking this weighty task, we’ve been careful to offend every major faction, group, species, administrator, edifice, committee, freshman, politician, athlete, scholar, and dog on campus. If you’ve been neglected or overlooked, please take offense at our negligence (maybe you don’t rate?). With the air thoroughly cleared, 1985 awaits...

* * *

Soft-spoken John Kuykendall will raise his voice — once — to announce his resignation. He will reemerge on the West Coast, Missy and the kids in tow, under the pseudonym Rex Savage (or is it Sex Ravage?), lead singer for heavy metal’s Twisted Dutchmen (or is it Dusted Twitchmen?).

* * *

The Women’s Concerns Committee will get “concerned” by the proliferation of imports. Borrowing from the U.S.-Japan agreements, they will ask Queens and Salem to impose voluntary import quotas.

* * *

The Gentlemen (?) of Kappa Alpha will find a distributor of milk by the keg and tap Davidson into a new social era. (It’s not just for breakfast anymore.)

* * *

Desperate, shotgunning freshmen of the Class of ’89 will pool their resources and buy a hall BMW. Pink.

* * *

D.G. Martin will set up his own scholarship fund to rival the Stuart Scholarship program. “Martin Scholars” will be chosen on the basis of hero-worship potential, “tough, independent problem-solving” ability, and susceptibility to trip on coattails.

* * *

Admissions Director John Griffith will discover the Platonic form of the “geek” in 1985’s applicant pool and quickly break precedent by offering him a position on the faculty.

* * *

Members of the Nuclear Awareness Committee, Amnesty International, and the Peace Coalition will realize they keep seeing the same people at each meeting. They will merge to develop a deprogramming hotline for students brainwashed by a conservative upbringing.

* * *

The authors will be unemployed, unmarried, and unavailable for comment in 1985, year of the humorless youth.

Levee Loot

Alright now, settle down. As chief mediator, I thank you, Mister mediator. As you know, gentlemen, you have insisted on the treaty and we have humble heads like beasts that we are. Noble. As you will not reduce your weapon supply, we dogs will proceed to utilize our Remington 30-06. We call it our Sentry. Hey! Rats can’t talk! You want to talk to a treat? No talk chit. Talking lizards ain’t too common. Neither...
