Here’s Mellon’s 3 Way Sport Outfit for Spring—

It’s a whole wardrobe at once!

The sport coat with matching and contrasting slacks can be worn in enough combinations to take the place of everything

Taste is the charm of Coca-Cola. It never loses the delightful appeal that first attracted you. And it never fails
to give you a happy after-sense of complete refreshment. So, join the millions who enjoy the delicious taste of Coca-Cola
