Staff Editorial

On Saturday night, the Davidson town police pulled over the Vamanos Van. Six students were cited for underage drinking and/or violation of open container laws. If the Vamanos Van were considered a commercial vehicle (like a party bus or a limo), then different laws would apply. But since it is legally a private van, its passengers are not allowed to carry open containers. We can’t change what happened last weekend, and powers higher than us will deliberate the implications of that incident. But now is the time to define some policies that will protect the Van from situations like this one.

The van serves a valuable purpose. Sure, it will take you to Wal-Mart or the movies. But it will also pick you up at a bar and take you home. And that’s its most important contribution: keeping drunk drivers off the road. Does it encourage us to get drunk? No. Does it keep us from driving when we are? Yes. The most important goal is keeping the Vamanos Van running. Having it as an option encourages students to make responsible decisions about drinking and driving.

First of all, if there’s a rule against open containers on the van, it certainly isn’t publicized or enforced. The regulations of the van need to be much more accessible. Many of the students carrying alcohol last weekend likely didn’t know they weren’t allowed to do so. And if they did know it was against the rules, they knew the rules aren’t enforced. While lack of punishment isn’t an excuse to break a rule, it is an incentive. There are valid arguments against having open beers in college vehicles, but is it really fair for a single student driver to be responsible for regulating what each passenger has in his or her hands (or backpack)?

Let’s do what is necessary to make the van a “hired vehicle” so that when the occasional beer ends up on board, no punitive action is necessary. Maybe each house on the Court can chip into a fund, so the driver is paid a small amount for his time. Wouldn’t giving each driver five dollars a night turn the van into a for-hire service? Clearly, there are legal and liability issues that make it hard for any of us to propose fully workable solutions. And we’re not suggesting that the College, or the students, act in a way that increases liability or promotes risky behavior. But the bottom line is that the Vamanos Van is an invaluable service that gives us the luxury of never even having to consider getting in a car when we’ve been drinking. So let’s determine exactly what the rules of the van are, make them public, and get Vamanos back on the road.

**Liberties vs. lives**

In response to “Tom’s Turn: The war on American ideals (Tom Anstrom, Sept. 15).”

Mr. Anstrom grossly exaggerates the sacrifices called for by our leaders while dangerously underestimating the nature of our enemy. Mr. Anstrom details the case of an apparently innocent man unfortunate enough to have been detained as a part of the ongoing terror search in our country. He does not mention the six Buffalo, NY, men with suspected ties to al Qaeda apprehended earlier this month.

More than 3,000 innocent people were ruthlessly slaughtered on Sept. 11. Is it better to detain some people mistakenly, if such action even modestly reduces the chance that another terrorist act might kill any number of innocent American people? I certainly think so.

President Bush and Attorney General Ashcroft have no interest in creating a dictatorship or police state. As conservatives, they believe in SMALL government. Mr. Anstrom contends that the suspension of some civil liberties to protect innocent lives will lead to a terrorist victory. In this regard, he shows his ignorance of our enemy. The terrorists believe they will have won when they have killed as many Americans as possible.

**Our Town: An Oasis Amidst the Sprawl**

Any trip down to Cornelius or Huntersville will likely include a “scenic” view of strip malls and fast food restaurants. While these examples of suburban sprawl lie just a few miles away, Davidson has been lucky enough to maintain its quaint, small-town atmosphere. Let us all just hope that it stays that way.

Today, suburban sprawl is among the greatest problems facing American cities. Sprawl doesn’t just create dilapidated inner cities, segregate groups by income and class, and increase pollution. A recent study by the Natural Resource Defense Council finds that sprawl is also partly responsible for the current drought. About 40% of Americans get their water from ground wells, yet suburban sprawl—acres of paved parking lots and multi-lane highways—prevents water from soaking into the ground and into the wells. The study estimates that as much as 31.5 billion gallons of water are lost in the Charlotte area every year due to suburban sprawl.

Although the town of Davidson has taken measures to prevent this sprawl from infiltrating our relatively pristine community, one need only drive five minutes in virtually any direction to find strip malls or rows of ubiquitous “McMansions” devouring the land like an out-of-control virus. Well, you say, my dorm is exempt from water restrictions, so...

**Cartoonist, lighten up!**

In response to Laura Filosa’s cartoon (Sept. 15, Perspectives).

If you can’t have fun on the court a) that’s too bad, cause a lot of people do, and b) don’t make fun of it or ruin it for others. You clearly find enjoyment other places, and you don’t see any demeaning cartoons/editorials about that. The Davidson experience is different for everyone, and it’s not a joke. Your negative attitude is terrible for impressionable freshmen. Let them decide for themselves, and let them find their own outlets for their own “Davidson Experience.” Stop complaining, lighten up and just have some fun. We are in college, you know.
