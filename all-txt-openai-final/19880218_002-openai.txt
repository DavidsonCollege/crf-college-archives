**THE DAVIDSONIAN**

**Class of ’88 chooses gift, plans fund-raising drive**

By MUADI MUKENGE

The members of the class of 1988 recently voted to provide funds for improving computer-related services as their gift to
Davidson College. More than half of the 356 seniors participated in the voting. According to the proposed Statement for the
Class Gift of the Class of 1988, the funds are “designed to strengthen and expand the college community’s technological capacities.”

The gift committee is currently debating methods by which to improve Davidson’s computing facilities. Suggestions have included innovative solutions to
the computer shortage problem, such as the establishment of a “library” of portable computers which students could “check out” and
use in their rooms after regular computer facilities had closed.

Overseeing the voting procedures and fundraising is the Senior Class Gift Committee, chaired by Caryn Coppedge and Alan Compton. According
to Compton, seniors are “really enthusiastic” about the computer gift idea... “we’re excited to be able to help.” In addition,
he continued, the Davidson computer services staff is grateful and excited about the commitment.

Suggestions for gift ideas were submitted by the senior class during the latter part of January. According to Compton, other
possibilities the seniors considered included an international student scholarship, a student service loan, a satellite dish, money to improve the
language lab, and a low-interest student loan. The computer facility improvement program received the majority of votes.

During spring term, a team of several dozen senior class “agents” will solicit their classmates for contributions to the Davidson
College endowment. Compton said the fundraising will continue over a five-year period, at the end of which it is hoped
that from $50,000 to $60,000 will have been raised. This capital will be placed in the Davidson College endowment. The
annual interest gained from it will be allocated from that time onward to the computer facility improvement program.

Senior class president David Cors said of the contribution to the endowment, “It’s been done this way at least since
1983, to get away from just giving a class bench or something. That’s just kind of trivial. And it’s a
way to keep giving to the school, too.”

Coppedge said seniors will be offered three payment options:
1) a graduate student plan, whereby one pays an annual low premium;
2) a working plan whose...Premiums increase each year; 3) and an Alenda Society plan by which students pay the highest
premiums and give $150 the fifth year, thereby qualifying for membership in the Alenda Society (an honorary circle of Davidson
alumni who have contributed $150 or more to the college). It is not certain at this time whether the class
will wait to raise the entire gift amount before it makes any donations, or if allocations will be made directly
from the interest accrued from spring term pledges.

A committee consisting of computer service staff members and a class representative will meet annually to decide each year’s appropriation.
The senior class gift committee includes Compton, Coppedge, Cors, Chuck Harris, David Maynard, Conrad Doenges, Amanda Barret, Elizabeth Rothschild, Barbara
Blood, and Ginger Broaddus.

Union Board to purchase laser printer
By MARGARET CARROLL

The Union Board is purchasing a new computer and laser printer to be used for publicity and graphics. Union Board
President Eric Whytsell said that the Union always attracts people as long as they are informed about Union events, and
the Union hopes to produce a campus-wide, regular, and informative newsletter that will help to publicize those events.

Union director William Brown said, “We had in mind a computer that would help us with publicity functions of the
Union, specifically tickets, programs, flyers, and a possible newsletter.” He said that the system will include a Hewlett-Packard LaserJet printer
and either an IBM Model 30 or a Model 50. Brown said, “The Union Board is not purchasing the printer
for students to use to print papers and résumés. We considered that possibility, but we’ve since decided that it’s just
not possible.”

Brown says that the Union staff may also be purchasing a computer and laser printer, but as of now, the
budget has not been approved. The Union itself is looking at the possibility of working with the computer center and
providing another printer for student use. Brown hopes that the Union would be able to place the printer in the
game room, where it would be used by the staff until 3:00, when the game room opens, and could then
be open to student use for printing their résumés and papers.

The Union Board’s computer and printer will cost approximately $5000. Brown said that the money will come from an unexpected
surplus in the board’s budget resulting from a Duke Endowment grant received about two years ago. “Suddenly we just happened
to have $6,500,” Brown said, adding that the Union prefers not to use surpluses to fund its regular programs, but
spends them on capital investments instead. “That’s how we purchased our video editing equipment,” he said.

If the Union staff budget allows for the purchase of another printer, it will be open to student use for
specified hours while providing the staff with a variety of new presentation options. Therefore, even if only the Board is
able to get the printer now, the Union will be able to continue to expand its services and try to
meet student needs.

Any student who suspects that he or she may have been exposed to chlamydia should see a doctor. The college
physicians hold sick call at the Davidson infirmary on weekdays from 1:30 to 3:00. All examinations are carried out in
complete confidentiality.
