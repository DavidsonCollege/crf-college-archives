“My legs were cramped and my feet were falling asleep,” recalled Sawyer. “I tried to communicate, but it wasn’t working.”

Schwartz, a state-champion wrestler in high school, managed to carry the bag with its 125-lb cargo onto the bus in
a standard, one-handed fashion.

Soon after boarding the bus, Schwartz had misgivings about their ploy and decided that it was not the best decision.
He then began to inform nearby passengers that there was a girl in the bag and to prepare for her
release.

“I told people because I realized it wouldn’t be funny and could be trouble,” he said.

After that, the students’ plan began to spin out of control, with passengers not sure how to understand the revelation
that there was a person in the duffel bag.

“One guy flipped out and threatened to fight me,” said Schwartz.

Eventually, the bus driver was informed that there was “a body in the bag,” causing him to call the police.
The bus stopped at the next station where the authorities were waiting.

Schwartz and Sawyer both found themselves in prison, with no method of communicating with each other. Their families each paid
the $500 bail.

“It was very frightening,” said Sawyer.

Carolina Trailways is investigating the incident, but the students’ legal problems may extend beyond state prosecution. Despite the fact that
the incident was a private matter, the school may punish the students if it feels their actions constitute a break
in its Honor Code.

With all the repercussions haunting him and his companion, Schwartz reflected, “We thought it would be funny, but now everyone
thinks it’s funny besides us.”

“asked to resign” but could provide no further explanation. Walker said that the department’s vacancies are far from unique.

“That’s typical for law enforcement,” he said. “Nobody’s ever overstaffed. There’s no such thing.”

Walker said that under optimal conditions, the department would employ eight full-time officers and eight to ten part-time officers. It
currently employs only five full-time officers and six part-time officers.

Members of Public Safety have managed to keep the department running smoothly by working longer hours and occasionally requesting the
assistance of the Cornelius police department.

Walker said that in his opinion, understaffing has not affected the department’s ability to do its job.

Approximately 46 individuals applied for the vacant Assistant Director position.

Walker recently concluded interviews with top candidates and plans to announce his decision by Friday.

The following week, Walker will devote a large portion of his time to filling two patrol positions. He said that
he has received eight to nine applications for those vacancies.
