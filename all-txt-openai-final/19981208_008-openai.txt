**The new Chambers: A ‘study’ in the new Exit 28 Denny’s**

With the systematic closing of our institution’s twenty-four-hour facilities and the tendency in our little piece of North Carolina for
eating establishments to close at dusk, there is a rising need for late-night sanctuary among the populace of Davidson College.

Until recently, the student’s options were limited to the Mooresville Denny’s at Exit 36 (“The 36”), the Waffle House next
door, and, for those who think a “late night” ends at 3 AM, the on-campus Union Outpost. However, as of
Monday, November 9, 1998, that has all changed. It was at this time that the much-anticipated Cornelius Denny’s at Exit
28 (“The 28”) opened its doors to all. For those who somehow managed to dodge the excitement, this new marvel
is located next door to the evil Shoney’s.

Twice denied previously, affirmation was received that the new Denny’s would finally be ready for business at 6 AM on
the 9th. Five Davidson students made it a point to be there. And so, as a golden glow glided across
the horizon, Kim Ceci (‘00), Catherine O’Dell (‘99), Aaron Snethen (‘00), Mark Jones (‘00), and Pete Thomson (‘00) (who had
slept in his clothes so as not to risk punctuality on needless preparation), were the first customers to walk through
the door.

After numerous photographs were taken to capture this momentous occasion, we were seated and attended to promptly. Unfortunately, due to
complications, we were unable to sit in the famed Carolina Room (complete with an operational fireplace and a collection of
literary classics on the mantle). Any disappointment generated by our inability to congregate in the Carolina Room was quickly dispelled
by the arrival of our food. In what we now know to be typical Exit 28 aesthetics, our Slams were
graced by a sprig of parsley and, as Catherine pointed out, butter segregated in “ramekins” so as to give the
customer free reign over his or her condimentation. Molly Markarian (‘02) would later say, “I liked the festive garnish on
my Scram Slam. It was very tasty.” The food was great, and we went back to our beds content and
well-fed, and in Pete’s case, still clothed.

That very evening, a much larger group representing all four classes tried out the new establishment, and a good time
was had by all. The staff and the facility easily accommodated our group of twenty-plus students, and all of the
students were impressed by the quality of the food, service, and decor. Waitress Carrie Warren took us in stride with
a comment of, “The more, the merrier.” The decor plays to both local culture, with, in Erin Dainty’s (‘00) words,
“a subtle but effective” touch of NASCAR, and also to the broader nationwide Denny’s feel.

It was noted by many students that this Denny’s seemed more upscale than others due to its tiled tables, shiny
surfaces, glass partitions, and wall-sized Mississippi River steamboat mural. Katie Keith (‘00) put it best by declaring, “I would come
here on a date,” (but not with the proverbial “Randy”).

A conversation with one of the managers, Roland, as well as subsequent trips to The 28 over the last couple
of weeks, showed that Denny’s has a lot to offer the student.

Denny’s restaurants everywhere make excellent late-night study havens, and The 28 is no exception. The coffee never runs out, and
an extension cord is always available for laptop users. The population density of Law Enforcement Officers rivals even the Outpost.

The Carolina Room is now open and can be used as a more private study area. Imagine sitting next to
the fireplace, doing something intellectual. Or, just sitting next to the fireplace.

Pete Thomson spent early Monday morning at Denny’s and said, “I really felt like Roland, Somer, and Eva were looking
out for me as I pored over various religious texts. My mug never ran dry, and I didn’t fall asleep
until sometime the next day.”

These sentiments and the supportive environment that fosters them are sure to please any Davidson student or faculty member. Sometimes
we might feel that we are strangers in a world that closes up early and packs it in for bed
before the work is done. This new Exit 28 Denny’s is a place where one can finally feel at home.
