### Sideline Highlights By ANDY DALE

#### CATS LOSE STADIUM

With officials of both schools in a hubbub, and the committee in charge of the American Legion Stadium in hot
water, it looks as if Davidson has come out on the short end of the situation. After Davidson-Wake Forest football
games were not rescheduled by Davidson last year, both schools claimed the use of the Stadium for Thanksgiving games after
this year. After much wrangling and legal red tape plus official discussion, the stadium rights were given to Wake Forest,
which will greatly alter Davidson's plans for Turkey Day.

Both schools appeared to have the stadium, but it seems that the solution was not fair at all to Davidson,
since it is so much closer to Charlotte than Wake Forest, and since Davidson interests are so much nearer to
Charlotte people. It is the case of an outsider coming in with legal technicalities to take away the just rights
of Davidson in this matter. While Davidson officials dickered with the chairman of the committee in charge, Wake Forest representatives
came up with the statement that the committee itself had contracted to give all rights to them and a Charlotte
court upheld Wake Forest’s claim; thus Davidson lost a place to play Thanksgiving games, when it was believed that everything
was being settled favorably.

All of which brings us to the fact that the Wildcats are minus their traditional setting for the future Turkey
Day games, and if the games are held at Davidson, they will have to compete with another big game in
Charlotte every year, which will hurt attendance tremendously. This action may force Davidson to move to some nearby town such
as Winston-Salem or Greensboro for the game, in which case it will appear doubly foolish for the Cats to travel
up-country while Wake Forest takes over home territory.

#### SHORT SHOTS FROM SATURDAY

Stan Yoder was the defensive star of the game, rambling all over the field to make consistently hard tackles. Dave
Spencer’s lightning thrusts through the air in the last half looked good, and his punting kept the Cats out of
trouble time and again. Bob Johnson and Bill Bolin were victims of terrifically hard blocks while chasing Carolina backs on
a pass interception and punt returns. Both came up ready for more though. Lalanne lacked the magical arm that carried
all but three passes to completion last year, as he fell to a sixty percent average. The sweet one also
looked bad when he called for a fair catch with no Davidson man near him. General George Stirnweiss with a
banged-up leg and water on the knee didn’t look as good against the Cats as George McAfee several weeks back.
However, both should be ready, and it will be a battle to the finish. Stirnweiss and Lalanne were tackled plenty
hard after passing, but both continued to get up unhurt apparently. Lalanne seems to have mainly stopped jumping before passing
as he did last year. Granville Sharpe had some more nice tackles from his safety man post, as he has
done all year. Spencer’s and Sharpe’s passes to Yoder in the flat looked good. We still want to see Stan
get a chance to get under full steam after one of those, which chance he hasn’t had as yet. The
Tar Heel receivers took the glory from others as they fought off Wildcat defenders to snag that rock time and
again. Davidson’s outweighed team again played hard ball all the way against hopeless odds.

#### Davidson B-Team Meets Lees-McRae Here Friday

Davidson's Beesters play their second game of the season tomorrow, facing a strong Lees-McRae Bobcat squad, coached by a former
Wildcat star, Johnny Mackorell. Lees-McRae has shown excellently so far this year. Among their victims, they count the powerful Crusaders
from Belmont Abbey and the Appalachian “B” team. This same Belmont Abbey aggregation trounced Citadel's frosh 32-0 and whipped Wingate
25-0. Armbruster, Legard, and Hendricks have been the spearheads of the Bobcat attack.

#### 13 Report To Initial Basketball Practice

The 1940 basketball team started its work last Monday night with 13 men reporting for practice. Seven men will be
held up for a while due to varsity and “B” football. These are Bell, Simonds, Williams, Niven, Strandwitz, Marsh, Cowan,
and Morehead. With four lettermen, three squadmen, and seven up from last year's frosh squad, Coach Shepard will have a
large number from which to pick his team, which will travel for games.

#### Wildcats Face Erskine; Basketball Drills Start

#### Wildcats Favored Over Erskine

#### Crippled Kits Lose To Imps

With an overwhelming superiority in numbers and power, the Duke Blue Imps crushed Davidson’s Freshmen Friday in Durham by a
53-0 count. The winning frosh chalked up nineteen first downs to the Wildcats’ three, while showing marked superiority in all
departments of play. Duke's initial drive began on the Wildcats’ 32 and carried to the Davidson 3, where a three-play
goal line stand held the Blue Imps from scoring. Maloney’s punt was blocked by a hard-charging Duke line three plays
later and the Imps scored from the seven in two plays. The remaining touchdowns were scored with the Imps depending
mainly on power plays for yardage. The Wildcats, severely handicapped against Duke by injuries and the absence of important men,
meet the Blue Ridge eleven this afternoon, strengthened by the return of Fredericks, Morehead, and Walton, all ineligible for the
Duke encounter.

#### A Team Appears In Last Home Game Saturday

#### Guilford Ties

#### Carolina Whips Cats — With Potent Ground And Aerial Offense

Stirnweiss, Lalanne Lead Tar Heels to Victory; Baker Scores Twice, Stirnweiss, Dunkle, Elliot Once; Spencer Leads Wildcat Offense

By Bob Carterof 11,000 sun-baked fans watched North Carolina’s undefeated Tar Heels, making use of long-range passes and power plays,
rack up a 32-0 win over the out-manned Davidson Wildcats in Winston-Salem Saturday.

The Wildcats got off to a bad start on the play after the kickoff. Inter-dormitory basketball got off to a
flying start with twelve games played last week. In games played Monday, Rumple nosed out the Barracks by the score
of 21-20. Darracott and White scored 8 points to lead their team. Georgia routed East to the tune of 27-14,
with Ficklen scoring 9 points for Georgia.

On Tuesday, the Barracks edged out East, 13-9. Watts finally won out in an extra period. West routed Duke, 39-10.
On Thursday, Watts walked over the Barracks 27-4, with the scoring being evenly divided. East defeated Rumple, 15-11. West showed
strength in beating Georgia, 30-18, with Turner making 11 points.

In Friday's games, Watts routed Rumple, 31-13, and Duke, 34-15. Louisiana State University has been placed on probation for six
months as regards federal student aid.

The Ohio University football team was undefeated in a home game from 1927 to 1937.

Coach Pete Whittle’s Cross Country team ended its season Saturday morning by tying Guilford 28-28 in Greensboro. Bob Kellogg of
Davidson covered the 3.1-mile course in 16:19 to place first. Meibohm of Guilford placed second, followed by Aiston, also of
Guilford, and Dick Gammon of Davidson who nosed out Colvin (D) for fourth place. Coming in sixth was White (G),
trailed by Dick Coppedge of Davidson and Osborn, Pickett, and LeGouly, all of Guilford. Mann of Davidson took seventh place,
ahead of Datzig (G), Palmadge (D), and Roberts (G).

Davidson Wildcats, nursing a 39-0 swamping at the hands of the mighty Tar Heels of North Carolina last week in
Winston-Salem, will return to their home field this Saturday where they angle with Erskine College. Erskine will present a team
which to date has won one game and lost five. Davidson has won one, losing six. The boys from Due
West are paced by Beatty, a triple-threat back. Much of Erskine’s offense is centered around this all-around performer. Edwards, a
6-foot, 3-inch end, is another star of the Seceders. He excels in pass receiving as well as being a good
defensive man. Pressly, a guard, is a standout performer as well. Offensively, the Erskine boys use a deceptive attack. So
far this year, however, it has not been very effective. Their line outweighs Davidson's. Defensively, they are scrappy and alert.

Davidson will enter the game in the favored role for the second time this season. In the five games these
two schools have played, Davidson has won all five by comfortable margins. An added feature of this game is that
it is the first home game for Davidson since three weeks ago when Catawba tripped the Wildcats. A return engagement
is scheduled with the Indians for Nov. 30. Most of the team is in good condition, with the exception of
Turnage, who has an injured knee.

The Wildcats haven't had much of an opportunity to learn their own plays. For every week, they scrimmage the varsity
using the plays of the Davidson opponent for the coming Saturday. However, Coach Spearman has given them a group of
plays, mostly those of North Carolina, to be run from a double wing-back formation, which employs much deception.
