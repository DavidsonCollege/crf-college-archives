THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE STUDENT BODY

**University Problem**

We are following with keen interest the most recent squabble at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The
question involves the president of the student body, who was given an official reprimand by the Men’s Honor Council at
Chapel Hill. He was found guilty of helping a coed break a rule against entering a closed fraternity house this
summer. The coed was suspended from school. The student body president was not sentenced, but his conviction will, of course,
be noted on his permanent record at school.

This week a group of eight student leaders asked the president, Paul Dickson II, to resign. He refused. Signers of
the statement include the chairman of the Men’s Honor Council, the chairman of the Women’s Honor Council, the men’s and
women’s attorneys general, and the president of the Interfraternity Council. Significantly they represent the most important student positions outside of
Dickson’s.

Last week the administration at Chapel Hill placed severe pressure on Dickson—in the form of an ultimatum—to resign. The administration
reconsidered its stand after several student leaders protested what they called “coercive tactics” by the administration. Thus, Dickson was left
with the weekend during which to ponder his decision to resign or remain in office. After informing a fellow student
of his decision to stay in office, he was presented with the request by student officials.

The case of Paul Dickson could have repercussions across the state and possibly in all phases of student government today.
Having only second-hand information of the case, we do not profess to be too informed on the case in Chapel
Hill. Commenting on the situation and on Dickson this week, The Daily Tar Heel said, “He holds the highest elective
office in Student Government, and knew well enough when he was sworn in that he was assuming responsibilities far and
above those of other students.

“For that reason, a Campus Code violation—especially one which has implications of moral laxity—is more serious when it is committed
by the person who should be the most responsible one on campus—the example-setter. He is a public figure and must
expect close inspection.

“Dickson has set a poor example. We have never doubted his sincerity or honest intentions to do the right thing,
but the fact remains that he has not been a frequent practitioner of ‘the right thing’ and has brought relations
with the administration to an unbelievable low.”

The Tar Heel went on to call for his resignation. Despite the tremendous pressures placed on him, we believe that
Dickson should have resigned. In doing so, he should be bowing not to the administrative pressure but to the best
interest of all student government.

**Proper Address**

President D. Grier Martin's remarks in chapel Tuesday have drawn many and varied comments from across the campus, as shown
by some of the other statements on this page. We admire the president wholeheartedly for speaking to the issues at
the beginning of school. Such a forthright approach on the college’s stand on specific issues has been sorely missing in
recent years and has drawn general agreement that the president was correct in addressing himself in such a way to
the topic of religious life at Davidson. It was the topic of serious study by faculty and YMCA committees last
year and has been a favorite bone to pick in recent years among professors.

**Noteworthy**

“Just great!” is the general consensus around campus this week about the terrific job done by the newly formed campus
Social Council last Saturday. Many people are still expressing pleasant surprise at the smoothly run activities during the weekend. President
Dan Campbell and his entire council deserve a real pat on the back for last weekend and for their upcoming
plans for the campus.

The attractive brochure recently issued on Davidson’s Distinguished Visiting Professor of Sociology, Dr. Wayland J. Hayes, is a commendable effort
on the part of the college’s publicity office. The handsome piece of information is a new venture and a successful
one, we believe, directed by Taylor Blackwell and his staff.

The spirit shown by this year’s crop of freshmen has raised more than a few eyebrows among upperclassmen. At the
mercy of a revised campus social structure, the Class of 1969 has demonstrated a taste of the unity it will
take to prove the merits (or demerits) of the new system.

**Sophomore Views India - Pakistan Crisis**

(Editor's Note: John Thomas, a sophomore from Charlotte, is a native of India who moved to the United States two
years ago. Below, he analyzes the present India-Pakistan situation. He received first-hand information from his father, who just returned after
spending the summer in India.)

By JOHN THOMAS

It is a fact that peace is the most vital issue for the world today. There are serious difficulties in
the way of peace but by standing between the two major power blocs democratic nonaligned countries have always played an
important part in the process of achieving this goal. But when two such nations strategically located in Asia dream that
the chief threat to their security does not come from an expanding neighbor but from each other, it is obvious
that their differences have clouded a dangerously important mutual threat.

Speaking of differences, the main one is that of religion. Islam and Hinduism have throughout history been incompatible. Today there
is intolerance in a section of Hindus towards Muslims. There is some talk of danger of proselytization and of upset
of present Hindu majority in the population of India. These wrong notions and distrust of Muslims are indications of a
deep resentment in the Hindu mind of past subordination under Muslim rule. This pent-up resentment of those days is responsible
for the mental aberration today of unwarranted glorification of the ancient past and vilification of things foreign. These false attitudes
have played their part in instigating the present conflict and are now thriving upon it.

In such a crisis there is always the danger of a repeat of the 1947 religious riots in which Hindu
turned on Muslim in predominantly Hindu India and Muslim slayed Hindu in Muslim Pakistan. Thus the present war has faint
reminders of a religious war shrouded by the trappings of modern diplomacy.

Writing from experience in India, the current war brings to light many faults in the present Indian government. The ruling
Congress Party headed by the scrupulous Shastri, which boasted of idealists and patriots has unfortunately become corrupt. The cause is
human nature and long continuance in power without any serious threat of displacement. The true remedy is fostering an ideal
Opposition Party capable of providing an alternate government and strong enough to have a fair chance of deposing the ruling
party.

The Kashmir problem was to have been solved soon after independence in 1947, by means of a plebiscite. India did
not grant one because of a valid nationalistic reason: it would lose, because 75 percent of the population of Kashmir
is Muslim. The technical official reason given was the fact that Pakistan had not removed all its troops from the
state and still controlled a part of it. The removal of all Pakistani troops had been a prerequisite for the
granting of a plebiscite.

After 1947, Kashmir was set up as a state of its own having a pro-Indian premier and government aligned with
India. Having had sentimental attachments to Kashmir, the late Prime Minister Nehru made it a matter of unwritten policy that
there would be no plebiscite and that India would always maintain and support apro-Indian government there. Since his death, the
ultranationalists in Indian politics have been pressing Prime Minister Shastri for complete integration of Kashmir to India. This has encouraged
the settling of the by Hill “oe me e MGB.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Senior Student Disputes Martin's Religious Stand

Dear Editor:

President Martin's talk Tuesday was deeply disappointing. It is almost inconceivable that sensitive, intelligent, and dedicated men such as compose
Davidson’s faculty and administration can fail to understand that forcing students to worship God is a violation of the very
religious freedom and human responsibility that Jesus himself died for.

It is further difficult to believe that these men fail to understand the difference between commitment and dogmatism. Dogmatism remains
when commitment is taken from the context of freedom and injected into the context of compulsion, where it never has
belonged. It is a sad and profound irony that our overseers use the name Jesus Christ in violating our right
to exercise religious freedom. Said overseers would like to ignore the undeniable evidence that the very forcing of students to
attend worship services elicits their resentment and undermines the authenticity of their experiences. But any child can observe that a
remarkably large number of students imprisoned in church on Sunday resent their confinement. It is impossible to justify the existing
regulations in the name of Christian commitment without misrepresenting the Gospel of love and freedom. Indeed one is led to
suspect that the College’s commitment is to public opinion rather than to Jesus Christ. The evidence is building. As if
the ultimate commitment of our being could be equated with History 11-12. Is it so ridiculous to ask that we
be given a certain necessary freedom where our ultimate commitment is concerned? The College may as well beat us over
the head till we confess, “I love Jesus.”

The College has an unfair advantage in that we cannot refuse to pay homage to the existing regulations without missing
the opportunity to worship with our fellow students or to hear guest preachers. This is the basest kind of arm-twisting.
So many of us would worship willingly—must we always bow our heads beneath the shadow of compulsion? Respecting the ultimate
concern of Jews and Catholics was a much-overdue step in the right direction—but what of the ultimate concerns of humanitarians,
agnostics, even atheists? Can an academic community be so presumptuous as to damn all men who prefer to deviate from
the commonplace? Who are we to judge the beliefs of others? Davidson College, sadly enough, does not appear at all
committed. It is obviously dogmatic. It is afraid to face the possibility, however remote, that its “ministry” to students will
fail miserably should the bars to religious freedom be lifted. How woefully misguided can men be?

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

THE DAVIDSONIAN welcomes letters from any reader, either in support of or differing from its policies. Letters should be typewritten,
double-spaced, and should not exceed 250 words. We also will receive longer articles, but must request that they be cleared
with the editor. In order to be printed in the following issue, letters should be received not later than 4
p.m. Tuesday. All letters must be signed.

The recent barrage of charges and countercharges coupled with conflicting claims have thrown a new element of confusion into the
present war. Over the last 18 years, the situation has become progressively complicated through frequent border skirmishes and unlawful occupation
of territory by troops of both sides. Thus even if both countries agreed to take a shot at the conference
table, a solution to the problem satisfactory to both sides seems quite remote. U Thant’s proposal that U.N. economic and
military reprisals be taken against both sides will probably be as effective as his cease-fire proposals. At the present time,
it is difficult to predict any definite outcome of the situation. By the time this comes out in print, it
might have changed radically. There is the strong possibility of American intervention due to any major Chinese attack on India.
If China stays out, there is the possibility of a stalemate when both India and Pakistan have thoroughly exhausted themselves.
Whatever might happen, the real answer to this and other similar world problems in the long run is the lessening
of petty national interests and the furtherance of an international outlook.

Cat O' Nine Tails
By MICHAEL L. HARRINGTON
Davidsonian Associate Editor

PRESIDENT MARTIN'S TALK in chapel Tuesday touched on a continuing problem here at Davidson: the relationship between Davidson's Christian commitment
and her educational spirit of free inquiry. Since her objective is a “free Christian college,” the question is “Can Davidson
reconcile its Christian commitment with its promise to place no limits on the adventures of the mind?” If “Christian commitment”
is defined to mean the infallible and undoubtable truth of the set of Reformation dogmas, one would of course assume
that basically Davidson is committed to religious indoctrination rather than a free quest for truth. And many conclude exactly this—but
I think it oversimplifies the problem.

Theological dogmas, particularly those of Reformation Christianity, may be theoretically opposed to a spirit of free inquiry. But since there
is no truly “theoretical” situation and no true scholarly objectivity, the practicalities of Davidson's position are what must be considered.

DR. MARTIN BROUGHT OUT many pertinent observations: for example, Davidson's Christian commitment has in the past enabled the college to
get the necessary finances for building a top-rate liberal arts college. Minus the historical commitment, we might also be minus
the contemporary college. And this observation underlines Davidson College’s compromise between its religious traditions and its educational goals: Religious traditions
are given official sanction and are stressed as predominant to the general public—then inside the classroom these religious traditions are
ignored as irrelevant to the very general goal of the quest for truth. For example, how many history courses here
emphasize Jesus Christ as the central fact of history?

The clumsy and sometimes inhumane Reformation dogma is simply given lip service and then dismissed—and this is vitally necessary for
the spirit of free inquiry. This should be no reflection on the good men we have here in our professorships,
many of whom have a sincere personal commitment to Reformation theology. A practical compromise between opposed ends must be made
somewhere and here is the place it is done. There are very few if any professors here who will penalize
a student because he adopts a non-Christian viewpoint, provided the student can defend his opinion with reason.

BUT THIS IS NOT TO SAY that Davidson makes no attempt to indoctrinate her students with her “historical Christian faith.”
I deliberately use the word “indoctrinate,” because in required religion courses and religious chapels and vespers the essence of Reformation
theology is presented as the way and the light with no alternative viewpoints explained or entertained. Required chapel and vespers,
as Will Terry remarked, are unfortunately the most practical method to ensure that all students are at least exposed to
Davidson’s religious commitment. Required vespers and chapels in themselves are not unreasonable, but as required religious exercises they are unfortunate
because students resent the spirit of indoctrination in the services as opposed to the spirit of free inquiry in the
classrooms. Dr. Buttrick and Dr. Martin miss the point when they equate compulsory academic courses with compulsory religious exercises for
that reason: compulsory academic courses are at least theoretically conducted in a spirit of free inquiry; compulsory religious services are
not. The probable point these men were making was that in a well-rounded liberal arts education some religious (once again
Reformation Christianity) exposure is needed; but the objection nevertheless stands.

“IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE SET-UP, why did you come here?” There will always be some narrow-minded individuals who bleat
this refrain at anyone suggesting any change. Besides this being an ad hominem argument, these people fail to see that
this encourages an already prevalent attitude among Davidson students: “Davidson’s religious exercises are just part of the price you have
to pay for coming to such a good school.” This attitude of general indifference, to say the least, is the
one most destructive to Davidson’s religious purposes. Though to be fair to the argument, one should acknowledge that those individuals
who sincerely believe that Davidson's religious commitment will inexorably cripple their developing minds would probably be better off at a
more secular school.

THE MOST IMPORTANT RESULT for me is that Davidson is making in “good faith” a compromise between the theoretically opposed
aims of religious indoctrination and free academic inquiry. Steps such as liberalization of the vespers requirement, allowing non-Christian professors to
teach on campus for a while, show this good faith in her continual redefinition. So despite what the future may
bring both for Christianity and the world, meanwhile Davidson College is well along the road towards being a liberal arts
college second to none.
