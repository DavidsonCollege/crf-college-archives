Nomad's Horoscopes

If today is your birthday, then you'll probably tell everyone anyway, just so you can get some groundless attention on the first day of school, you little dork. Happy Birthday, you're that much closer to death.

LEO: Your pathetic existence takes a turn for the worse. The acne on your back grows into several swollen boils that no licensed dermatologist will even consider lancing.

VIRGO: While Jenine suggests that since Virgo is one of the most highly intelligent signs of the zodiac, you should pull through with much aplomb, she's wrong. If you're a freshman guy lucky enough to be born under this lovely sign, it will remain applicable until the senior women start to get desperate.

LIBRA: Your constant search for balance winds up fruitless this week. Get a life, and give up on this quest for astrological equilibrium.

SCORPIO: "Come armageddon, come." "Me without clothes, well, a nation turns its back and gags." Don't eat your friends on Sundays in November.

SAGITTARIUS: What the hell is the deal with that half man-half beast sign thing you people have? The stars suggest that it represents the bestial nature of humanity, but hey everybody sucks, so don't go thinking that you're something especially rotten, which you probably are.

CAPRICORN: Remember Bowser from the hit series Sha-Na-Na? Rumor has it that he's been seen zipping his fly while leaving your house.

AQUARIUS: You shall spend the first night back surrounded by desperate and pathetic members of the class of '91 who can't handle life away from Davidson, and wind up hooking up with sophomores.

PISCES: Coo coo ca choo, I am the walrus.

ARIES: Michael Landon's death has left an inestimable void in your already worthless existence. Just remember, even though Charles Ingalls was a pretty nice dad, Willie and Nellie Olson had the rich parents, and all the cool stuff.

TAURUS: "The flowers came back, and I hushed."

GEMINI: Years from now, your best friend from youth shall reach high office, and when you wave him down in a crowd he will look right at you and quote a king: "I know thee not, old man."

CANCER: You'll win the "Name Paula Abdul's Tour" contest with the phrase: Short, Chesty, Lip-synching Bimbo In Tight Pants: '91 World Tour.
