Field Hockey shines at home but loses 3 of 4 on the road —

By ALISON KALETT
Sports Editor

Davis and Elkins College never had a chance on Saturday against the 1998 Lady Wildcats Field Hockey team. The Wildcats
(2-5) dominated the game from the onset en route to a 6-0 trouncing of their opponents.

The home-field win was truly a team effort as six different players scored for Davidson. A score by #9 Kim
Ceci with 26:53 remaining in the first half followed by a goal by Lea Jaeger with 11:53 left gave the
Wildcats a solid 2-0 lead heading into the second half.

In the second period, the ‘Cats truly dominated. They outshot their opponents by an impressive 13 to 1 margin and
added four additional goals. The Davidson second-half scorers were Kate Schoening, Lisa Holthaus, Ashley Hart, and Laura Rosenbach. Rosenbach’s goal
with 1:30 left in the game was the icing on the cake in Davidson’s 6-0 rout.

The win over Davis and Elkins marked the Wildcats' second win of the season. The first one came the previous
Saturday at the University of Louisville where Davidson escaped with a 3 to 2 win. The one-goal margin is deceptive
as the last of Louisville’s scores came in the final seconds of play.

In the first half, Davidson players Amy Lamoriaux and Jennie Gold scored at 14:05 and 2:05 respectively, while Louisville was
able to cut the Davidson lead to a single goal with 15:40 remaining in the first half.

The second period was closely contested, but a score by #3 Lisa Holthaus with slightly over 11 minutes left in
the game sealed the victory for the ‘Cats.

The win over Louisville came on the heels of a tough defeat to Catawba College (1-2) on September 15th. The
Lady Indians took an early 2-0 lead on the Wildcats, but Davidson fought back when sophomore Ashley Hart scored with
8:45 remaining in the first half.

The second half was a see-saw battle of scoring. Catawba scored with 27:16 to play, but Lisa Holthaus of Davidson
brought the Wildcats back within one with 12:29 left. However, a Davidson victory was not meant to be as Catawba’s
Elizabeth Howard put the Indians ahead by an insurmountable two-goal margin with a little less than four minutes remaining. Davidson
lost by a score of 4 to 2.

Unfortunately, Davidson also lost two other road games earlier in the week. One to the University of Ohio on Sep.
20th and another to Radford on the 23rd. Against Radford, the Wildcats mounted a late second-half comeback, but three first-half
scores and one second-half goal were enough to give Radford the 4-2 victory. Against the University of Ohio, the Wildcats
fell 5 to 0.
