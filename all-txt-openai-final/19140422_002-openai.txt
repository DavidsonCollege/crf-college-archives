THE ALUMNI ISSUE.
Every week since the first issue of “The Davidsonian” appeared, we have been receiving letters of cordial encouragement and interest
from men who, though they have graduated from Davidson, cherish still an abiding affection for her. It is for Davidson’s
Alumni, scattered wide over the Southern States and into the North, that this edition of the paper is issued. It
will go to every man that has left the college since the class of 1909, and to a hundred more
in previous classes.

We send you greeting from the campus and halls and athletic field that were once yours. They are still yours
in memory and because of the common tie that unites every Davidson man, alumnus or undergraduate. “Once a Davidsonian always
a Davidsonian” was proved clearly last week when eight Davidson alumni at the University of South Carolina sat together and
yelled for the Red and Black in the two baseball games. Such a spirit will build up Davidson's influence and
recruit new men more than any other conceivable agency.

“The Davidsonian” was begun as much to cement the alumni to the college by keeping them in close touch with
all its doings and progress, as to create and increase spirit and unity in the student body. Do you want
to know what Davidson is doing in athletics, in debating, in every other line? Do you want to know what
the fellows you knew are succeeding in at the college? Would you like to know where the old fellows—your college
mates, classmates, floor mates, are, and how the world is treating them? Do you want to know how Davidson is
growing? Then “obey the impulse” that made you fight and yell and work for the college when here—sit down and
enclose one dollar to the Business Manager for a subscription to “The Davidsonian,” that will continue through next year. We
need you and you need “The Davidsonian.”

This issue is given largely to items about alumni and to plans for the reunion at Commencement. Each week there
will always be a column of Alumni Notes, and any news for it will be most welcome. With heart and
hand let us all work for the greater and better Davidson that is to be!

THE WAKE FOREST SERIES.
Much depends on the Wake Forest series this week. Wake Forest has had an unsuccessful season, but is appearing much
stronger now and is sure to put up a stiff fight. But Davidson undoubtedly has the better team, and ought
to win. We need the games. One will be played on the Hill and the other in Charlotte. The students
should give the Red and Blacks such a hearty backing next Friday that they will go to Charlotte determined to
capture the whole series from the Baptists.
