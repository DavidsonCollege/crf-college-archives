Mack Erwin
Mack Erwin, a tackle on the Davidson varsity football team, hails from Greenville, S.C., where he played three years at fullback for Greenville High, making people sit up and take notice. After graduating in the spring of 1944, he entered the University of South Carolina but kept a hopeful eye on Davidson. While he was waiting, Uncle Sam requested his presence, so "Big Mack" entered the Navy and served in Japan. After V-J Day, he was stationed in Hankong, China. He was discharged in July.

Coach Parker Is Davidson Grad
Charlie Parker, Davidson's wrestling coach and trainer, began his athletic career at Davidson High School. There he participated in baseball for two years and football for one. In 1938, he entered Davidson College and graduated with the class of 1946. At Davidson, he played two years of varsity baseball and was a member of the SAE social fraternity, the "D" Club, and the track team. In his spare time, he was a swimming instructor at an Elks camp during the summer. Parker spent four years in the Army Air Forces, serving in the Pacific theater of World War II. When asked about his future, he said, "I'll get married and settle down."down in South Carolina, emerged in the winter as a “first looie” after its large enrollment in the Physical Education Department at the University. He is working on his Master’s Degree in Physical Education, which he plans to complete this summer at Chapel Hill. Charlie’s hobbies are hunting and economics (he is now working on a method for reviving old fluorescent tubes).

Coach Va is a family man; married since 5. He is also an electrician, handling radio repairs, electrical supplies, and light bulbs.

Outside of blowing the more than looking at them pretty pitchers and them classy advertising in THE DAVIDSONIAN (for $1.50 a year), there’s nothing I enjoy more.
