### Small Reviews with Jon Glance

#### Was (Not Was)
#### The Police

In the beginning, there was James White and the Contortions, and Funk Punk (a.k.a. No Wave; from the “No New York” LP) was a mixture of equal parts James Brown groove, Johnny Rotten nihilistic snarl, Captain Beefheart dissonance, and Ornette Coleman free-blowing. Then David Byrne went back to Africa, and “Remain in Light” replaced the snarl with a cosmic diatribe over complex polyrhythmic percussion. Now, with “Was (Not Was)”, two weird white guys from Detroit have put more Funk in the genre than Punk, but the result is still bizarre enough to warrant interest.

“Was (Not Was)” is made up of Don Was and David Was (not their real names) and numerous session musicians, including the former Brides of Funkenstein, ex-MC-5 guitarist Wayne Kramer, and ex-trumpet player for Ray Charles, Marcus Belgrave. This blend of soulful funk, psychedelic rock, and free-jazz dissonance is much more than one might think; however, the lyrics are the most interesting thing about this album. In “Oh, Mr. Friction!” the chorus is:

“Drink from the bottle when I’m home alone...
Spank the kids with a fork
Run the appliances high speed all day
Switch station every five seconds.”

The song relates a dramatic monologue of a mental breakdown in Suburbia, with the emotionless background vocals and lazy horns providing pointed contrast to the psychotic lead vocals. Perhaps the best cut on the album is “Tell Me That I’m Dreaming,” in which an astonished brother relates a capitalist nightmare (“One man liked milk/ Now he owns a million cows”) of some not-too-distant future. Over the funk vamp, however, is a tape of Ronald Reagan repeating “Out of control” over and over. Weird. One song that is climbing up the disco charts is the accidentally-commercial “Out Come the Freaks,” a diagonal saga of the aftermath of a Nuclear holocaust.

While “Was (Not Was)” may be too funky for some New Wavers, fans of Frank Zappa, Parliament/Funkadelic, and the Talking Heads will probably like this album. Well, Dick, I'll give this album a 94; the lyrics are strange, but it’s got a good beat and you can dance to it.

#### Ghost in the Machine
(Personnel: Sting, bass and vocals; Andy Summers, guitar; Stewart Copeland, drums and percussion)

With the release of their fourth album, “Ghost in the Machine,” the Police achieve a quantum leap in respectability in New Wave circles. Critics who bemoaned the vacuous pop tones on “Zenyatta Mondatta” will be relieved by the eleven complex, intelligent songs on this LP, arguably their best effort. “Ghost in the Machine” shows marked alterations in the tone, style, and production from previous Police albums.

The tone is much darker than before, even on the commercially acceptable single “Every Little Thing She Does is Magic.” This song, released before the LP, is more similar to the dreamy “Walking on the Moon” than to the vapid “De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da,” fortunately for the serious listener. The titles on this album (“Spirits in the Material World,” “Invisible Sun,” “Secret Journey,” and “Darkness,” for example) give some indication of this change, as does the album art (gloss black, with three ambiguous computer digits, as opposed to the prior use of pervasive portraits of Sting and the rest).

The change in style perhaps owes something to the Police’s world tour to places where few or no rock bands had ever performed before—particularly the Middle East and India. While many of the songs on this album still mix New Wave drive with slick reggae rhythms, there are many genres not previously heard from this band which are intermingled with it. Jamaican dub, funk grooves, and psychedelic phrasings all find their way into the cuts, in a thick soup of sound which is hypnotically mystic at times. Horns (unfortunately uncredited on the scant liner notes) are used to great effect in most of the songs, and the occasional atonalities of the overlay of synthesizers, horns, and guitar produce a sound oddly reminiscent of “Remain in Light” and early Pink Floyd.

While the production of “Ghost in the Machine” is as uniformly brilliant as in previous albums by the Police, there are a number of positive changes. Sting’s rock steady bass lines have the power of Dub, and a sinuous energy that prods and drives the songs. Stewart Copeland’s drumming is excellent as usual, but Andy Summers’ guitar shows a dramatic improvement. His solo work borders on the psychedelic, with obvious influences by Jimi Hendrix and Robert Fripp. The dense, provocative mix which washes over you like the warm darkness of a sensory deprivation tank provides the final link in this truly fine album.

In “Ghost in the Machine,” the Police move toward the front of the New Wave, with the Talking Heads and the Clash, as innovators, not merely popularizers. Hopefully, the Police have gained a large enough audience to take these innovations to Middle America, something David Byrne and Joe Strummer have not yet succeeded in doing.
