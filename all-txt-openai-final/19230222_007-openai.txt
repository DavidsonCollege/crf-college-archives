PRIZE ESSAY CONTEST OPEN TO STUDENTS

The Institute of International Education is conducting a prize essay contest among undergraduate students on “The Cancellation of the Allied Debts.” By undergraduate student is meant one who, in a college or scientific school, is doing the work prescribed for the degree of bachelor, or its technical equivalent. Hence, it is seen that practically all the students of Davidson will be eligible in the contest.

The merits of the essays will be judged by a committee consisting of five of the most well-known American financiers, and the awards of the prizes will be made May 1, 1923. The three best essays will receive prizes of $150, $100, and $50, respectively. These essays should not exceed 5,000 words nor be less than 3,000 words, and they must be in the hands of the judges by March 15, 1923. Any student desiring additional information concerning the contest may obtain such from Liston Elkins.or Bill Heston.

### SUMMER TRAINING CAMPS FOR SOUTHERN CITIZENS

Word has been received from Capt. Donovan Yeuell, United States Army, acting C.M.T.C. officer of the Fourth Corps Area, which includes the States of Georgia, Alabama, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee, that elaborate plans are now under way for the continuance of the government summer camps for young men which proved so popular last summer and the summer before. Nearly three thousand young men received an outing at government expense last year, some at Fort Barrancas, Fla., on the Gulf of Mexico, and some at Camp McClellan, in the rolling, wooded hills, near Anniston, Ala.

The following is a typical example of many letters being received from last year’s students: “I attended Camp McClellan the summer of 1922. I can testify for your benefit as well as others, that this month of training did me more good than any other training that I have so far received.”

According to present plans, camps are to be held this year at Camp McClellan, Ala., Fort Barrancas, Fla., and Fort Bragg, N.C. The branches of instruction offered may be slightly different from those of last year, but in the main will be in the same branches, which include infantry, cavalry, field artillery, engineers, and coast artillery.

The courses offered include a basic red course, which gives fundamental training but does not instruct in any particular branch of the service; advanced red course, which gives basic instruction in branches desired; white course (for which graduates of last year’s red course who were certified as eligible for admission to the white course are qualified), fits students to be non-commissioned officers in the organized reserves or the national guard; and the blue course (for which graduates of last year’s white course who were certified as eligible for admission to the blue course are qualified if of the proper age and possess necessary educational qualifications), which fits candidates for commission in the officers’ reserve corps.

The age limits are the same as for last year: 17 to 25 for the two red courses, 18 to 26 for the white course, and 18 to 27 for the blue course. These age limits do not apply to those who attended a citizens’ military training camp in 1921. Veterans of the world war may be accepted up to 35 years of age.

Although formal application blanks have not been received, young men of proper qualifications will find it to their advantage to mail requests for applications to the acting C.M.T.C. officer, Fort McPherson, Ga., at as early a date as possible. Although it will be possible to accommodate more than fifty percent more candidates than were accommodated last year, it is expected that many more will apply than can be admitted. By having your request for application on file, you will have the opportunity to receive the application blank early. All who desire applications should state their date of birth and former military service of any kind.
