**Kuykendall announces resignation**

**In an emotional faculty meeting, president announces return to teaching**

In an emotional faculty meeting Tuesday, January 16, College President John Kuykendall announced his plans for resignation as of June 30, 1997. This announcement came after Kuykendall wrote to Craig Wall, Chairman of the Board of Trustees, of his intentions to conclude his term as president of the college.

Following the presidency of Sam Spencer, Kuykendall came to Davidson in 1984 to see the college through more than 10 years of growth and enrichment. The construction of the Baker Sports Complex and the Visual Arts Center, the increase in student body size from 1,400 to 1,600, the change from Division I-A football to Division I-AA, a devastating hurricane, and a successful five-year, $160 million Campaign for Davidson have been among the many successes and challenges of Kuykendall’s term at Davidson.

Kuykendall came to Davidson in 1984 as the 15th president after teaching at Auburn University for 11 years in the religion department. He was a 1959 graduate of Davidson and later was ordained a Presbyterian minister. Kuykendall says he plans to return to the classroom to teach in Davidson’s religion department.

In a letter to faculty and staff of the college, Kuykendall wrote, “I came to this job in 1984 with the expressed expectation of serving for no more than 10 years. The fact that I have stayed a bit longer is indicative of the level of personal pleasure and fulfillment I have derived from the work and from the relationships it has afforded both of Davidson and elsewhere.”

Kuykendall hopes that this announcement will give the college the adequate period for the selection of a new president starting in the fall of 1997. Says Dean of Students Tom Shandley of Kuykendall’s resignation, “John has been beloved by all — faculty, staff, students, and trustees — and that’s the gift he has brought to us all.” Shandley continued to say that Kuykendall’s successor will have “tough shoes to fill.”

Says Kuykendall of his presidency, “It’s been the greatest privilege of my life ... a time filled with really wonderful experiences that I would not have otherwise had in terms of working with people for the common good.”

Self-Selection night involved the usual activities of champagne drenching, beer sliding, and running around without any clothes. However, it may have escaped the attention of many that another crucial house activity took place last week: presidential elections.

The newly elected VIPs of the Court are as follows: Molly McGehee, Connor; Mike Ingram, Phi Delt; David Farrar, PiKA; Susie Spressert, Rusk; Sam Murphy, SAE; Rix Threadgill, Sig Ep; Kelly McAlister, Warner Hall; Josh Norris, KA; and David Wick, Kappa Sig. Ben Hill, the president of Figi, will retain his post until elections next fall.

As presidents of the very recent past relinquish their crowns, they experience mixtures of sadness and excitement for the new leaders of their houses.

Holly Kledis, former president of Rusk, says, “I’ve had a blast this past year. I’m excited for Susie to experience all the things that I have.”

The new presidents are eager to undertake their duties. “I’m totally psyched to be back from abroad,” says McGehee, “and being the president is a really great way to get back into the Davidson scene.”

Ingram says, “It feels good. I have a lot of responsibility, but I think it’s a good thing to continue the great reputation that [Phi Delt] has.”

The men’s basketball team has an in-house stat coaches call “effort points.” It is compiled by adding the number of offensive and defensive rebounds, loose balls picked up, deflections caused, and charges taken that a player records in a game.

Essentially, the stat provides a tangible measure of the team’s hustle. To pass the course, as coach Bob McKillop says, each player should average about one effort point per minute played.

Friday afternoon, while still basking in the glow of Thursday night’s 56-47 win over UNCC at the Charlotte Coliseum, McKillop said, “Last night, we certainly got an A.”

And in recent weeks, Davidson has been recording a bunch of high grades and has won seven of its last eight games to put the Wildcats atop the North Division of the Southern Conference with a 2-0 league record, 11-3 overall.

The Wildcats could have had a chance to add another win if not for a rare postponement of Saturday’s game against Virginia Military Institute.
