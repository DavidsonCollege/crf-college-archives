**Professors**

Editor's Note: The following report was prepared by Professors Charles Ratliff, David Kaylor, and Robert Avinger for the local chapter of the American Association of University Professors, and they have agreed to its publication.

To our knowledge, there does not exist any systematic method for assisting the college administration in the formation of budget priorities. It is true that wise choice depends on good judgment, but good judgment alone does not guarantee wise choice. The committee therefore recommends that the administration seriously consider the adoption of a planning, programming, budgeting system (PPBS).

Program budgeting is a system for "assisting choice related to the use of resources." It therefore has the capability of making clearer the alternatives available and the costs associated with each of these alternatives. In short, it is choice-illuminating in the sense that it provides comparative information organized around identifiable programs or functions of the college.

The need for a PPBS system arises because of two primary conditions. First, resources are scarce—that is, we cannot do everything that we would like to do such as produce a Rose Bowl contender, have several Nobel prizewinners on the faculty, and have the highest faculty salaries and the lowest student-to-faculty ratio in the nation. Second, in educational systems, there are no automatic regulators—namely, prices, profits, and losses—that can guide resources into alternative functions and that can tell us when a function or program has either outlived its usefulness or could be made more efficient.

The starting point is the program budget. Optionally, the output or final products of the institution must be identified. This implies that the goals of the college should be understood and articulated. The Revised By-Laws of the Trustees of Davidson College (October 22, 1971) identify the following goals or purposes of the college:

1. A commitment to the Christian religion, particularly to the Presbyterian Church as fostered by religious services and activities;
2. Quality teaching and instruction centered around "a small community of learners" and "personal relationships between students and teachers";
3. The promotion of "creative scholarship" on the part of the faculty;
4. The selection and admission of quality students;
5. The provision of physical education;
6. The encouragement of competitive athletics;
7. The provision of varied social and cultural activities.

As supportive of the above goals, the college should:

8. "Provide adequate physical facilities" and
9. "Increase its financial resources."

Once the task of elucidating goals has been accomplished, the budget should be construed with these goals or outputs as major programs. Of course, sub-categories or programs would also be defined. For example, a major program would be teaching and instruction; however, for more detailed planning, the latter would consist of sub-programs or functions like the Honors College, the Department of Instructional Development, the Humanities Program, and academic departments.

The first step, specifications of the programs and their objectives, having been accomplished, the second task is to measure the output of each program. Although this is the most troublesome aspect of educational programs, certain proxies are available. The third step involves the measurement of the total costs of each program. Finally, alternatives are analyzed and decisions are made. Hopefully, such a system will make for better, more rational decisions and will lead to a better allocation of resources. In short, "the program budget is a potent instrument for communication and an intelligent superstructure without which analysis becomes futile."

Before turning to specific examples taken from a recent budget, several caveats should be mentioned. First, program budgeting is basically a planning tool. It is not intended as a guide for making short-term reallocations of funds. Second, it is not intended to supplant administrative or political decision-making. It is not a system of decision by computers; thus it does not overrule human judgment.

**Entertainment**

The Scots Guards, a 330-year-old Scottish military company, will sing Beatles’ songs, do the Highland fling, and play bagpipe melodies in the Charlotte Coliseum at 8 p.m. on Feb. 10. Tickets to the drum, bagpipe, band, and dancer corps are $3 to $5.

"The Barber of Seville" starring Thomas Palmer as Figaro comes to Ovens Auditorium next Monday evening at 8:15. Tickets to this English rendition of Rossini’s famous play range from $1.50 to $5. A special free matinee rehearsal for youth Sunday afternoon at 2:30 is open to all students.

"Night of the Iguana" continues at the Little Theatre of Charlotte with five more evening performances Feb. 4, 5, 10, 11, and 12 at 8:30 and a matinee Sunday at 2:30. Some consider this awesome and powerful drama to be Tennessee Williams at the top of his form. Ellen Tripp and Cy Triplett star.

The Nikolas Dance Company will climax three days of free demonstrations with their famous "Tent Scenario Nouminou" and other excerpts from "Imago" in Ovens Auditorium at 8 p.m. on Feb. 9. The entire company will give a free ballet demonstration at 8 p.m. in Dana Auditorium at Queens on Feb. 7. Several classes led by members of the troupe, Tuesday and Wednesday at Queens and UNCC, are also open to the public; however, student tickets to the climax are $2.look the human element by attempting to quantify everything. But it should enable us to move away from extensive use of “ad hocery” in setting our budget priorities and allocations. Finally, it may be disruptive in the sense that it can facilitate frank and open exchange between faculty and administration and among faculty on the “real” alternative costs of various college functions and programs.

Now to some examples. Several blatant shortcomings are apparent from even a cursory review of the College's budgeting system (see Treasurer's Report, 1970-71). We shall mention only a few.

ATHLETICS AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION

A reasonable case can be made for a classification into two programs—physical education (intramural and instruction) and intercollegiate athletics. The latter program could possibly be further divided into two sub-programs, subsidized and non-subsidized intercollegiate athletics, with further refinement into the various sports. The present budget, however, is divided into three major categories:

(a) Organized Activities Related to Educational Departments: Athletics and Physical Education, which involved total expenditures of $379,000 of which $245,000 were salaries.
(b) Grants-in-Aid involving $143,000 for football and $53,000 for basketball.
(c) Intercollegiate Athletics, which listed income from games and the expenses associated with each sport. The net profit of our intercollegiate program(s) as reported in this budget item was $20,000.

All salaries, whether of full-time intercollegiate coaches or of physical education instructors, were allocated under category (a). Thus the costs of the various intercollegiate sports (category (c)) did not accurately represent the real costs of these programs. The same criticism can be levied at “supplies and equipment” costs included in category (a) and Grants-in-Aid.

INSTRUCTION

(a) LABORATORIES AND DEPARTMENTS. In 1970-71, $69,000 was allocated in this category. Presumably this groups together science, language, and accounting labs. It is unclear that these constitute a single program.
(b) HONORS COLLEGE. The total amount budgeted was $34,000, yet a portion of the salaries of those faculty members in the Honors College should be so allocated. At the same time, the Dean of the Honors College also teaches in the regular curriculum. The first omission underestimates the cost of this program; the second overstates it. On balance, there is no way, given our present budgeting system, to determine the cost of this program.
(c) R.O.T.C. AND AUDIO-VISUAL. This is a classic case of trying to mix oil and water.
(d) FACULTY: OTHER EXPENSES. This item ($88,000) probably includes the cost of the typing pool; but these services are also utilized by administrative personnel. A proper allocation would distribute these expenses to the appropriate programs.

OTHER GENERAL INSTITUTIONAL EXPENSES

(a) INVESTMENT AND CUSTODIAL SERVICES. If a major goal of the College is to “increase its financial resources” (see By-Laws, Board of Trustees), then this goal should be identified with the “Development” program, and these funds ($26,000) should be so allocated.
(b) CENTRAL PUNCH CARD. To the extent that the computer is jointly utilized by the faculty (for instruction and for research), the registrar, the business office, etc., these expenses ($40,000) should be allocated accordingly. Again, only by such an allocation can the real costs of specific programs be assessed.
(c) STAFF RECRUITMENT, ANNUALS AND HANDBOOKS. Once again this category does not identify any specific program. Second, if the expenses ($2,000) were incurred to recruit staff, then they should be allocated to the particular staff program or function affected. If faculty recruitment necessitated these expenditures, then a different allocation would be appropriate.
(d) REPLACEMENT OF DICTAPHONES AND OTHER OFFICE EQUIPMENT. The logic of example (c) above also applies to these expenses ($9,000).

The above illustrations will hopefully substantiate the need for a change in our budgeting process. At present it is difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain what programs the College has, how they are related to the goals of the College, and what their total costs are. And it is only through a knowledge of these issues that programs can be evaluated, resources can be utilized most effectively in furthering the goals of the College and, in short, wise decisions can be made.
