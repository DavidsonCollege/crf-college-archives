OUR NEXT GAMES.
Tomorrow Richmond comes down for a game, reporting a much stronger team than last year. Friday and Saturday Guilford will be met in a two-game series. Friday's game is to be played here and Saturday’s in Spencer. It will be remembered that Guilford beat Davidson in 1913, due mainly to the efforts of Shore, of the last world series fame.

DAVIDSON'S GOLF COURSE PRAISED BY EXPERTS
Mr. Carl Anderson, the golf professional who recently gave an exhibition here, was very enthusiastic over the local course. He remarked that “in holes 3 and 9 the Davidson course has two of the most interesting short holes that can be found on any Southern course.” Mr. Scott, of Boston, who accompanied him, said that this course is the only one he has ever found near a college campus. It is also one of the most interesting because of the care needed in playing each hole. Since Mr. Anderson was here, a new interest has sprung up in golf on the campus. Three new members have been added to the club roll. The president of the club announces that the first roundsThe annual handicap will be played Monday, April 10th.
