**Fannie & Mable To Close At End Of Winter Term**  
By LEE WHITE

Fannie & Mable’s 37 members voted Monday night to close the eating house at the end of winter term. According to F & M president Sherry Schwenke, the decision to close resulted from increasing deficits and declining membership. F & M treasurer Mark Steiner said the situation had become unmanageable. A fall deficit of $883 had been covered by surplus money. Winter term, however, is costlier because of heating bills and quarterly taxes due in December. F & M faces the possibility of a $2,500 deficit this term. Members had agreed that they would cover F & M's debts, he said, but “we don’t expect to have a deficit.”

The house is implementing cost-cutting measures in hopes of alleviating the debt. In order to strengthen the house and avoid closing, an effort was made to attract freshmen to house meals. Sixty-five freshmen signed up for meals winter term. However, Steiner said, when house members asked if they believed F & M would get at least 20 freshman members, “no one raised their hands.”

Among the steps being taken to keep the house from facing a deficit when it closes, weekend meals have been eliminated, and efforts have been made to reduce food costs. Breakfast food has been discontinued, desserts will be limited, and there is no social budget. The house may also auction its belongings to raise funds.

According to F & M vice-president Catherine Melton, the “house has been steadily declining for three years, as fewer freshmen self-selected it each year. The closing comes as no surprise to me,” she said. “I’ve known it was going to happen for a long time.” She feels that some members lacked interest in changing the situation. Although a mandatory guest policy was set up to encourage members to bring people down for meals, some members failed to do so.

College Business Manager Bob Currie said the plans for closing took him by surprise. Over the years, he said, F & M has been one of the stronger eating houses.

**More Than Davidson's First Lady**  
By THURSTON HATCHER

Though she has tolerated over the past months a number of annoying titles as “the president's wife” and, worse, “Davidson’s first lady,” Missy Kuykendall does not seem to have an identity problem. In fact, she could comfortably say that she has established herself as her own individual at Davidson.

Ever since her husband John began serving as Davidson's new president last July, Kuykendall has actively developed her own role as a valuable contributor to the community. She has used her experience in psychology (she has a master’s degree in counseling and student development) to find her niche here. Among other things, she is a member of Davidson's new RAPE program; she taught a short course in assertiveness training, she is working with Bill Bolding and the Housing Office on the selection and training of resident advisors; and she is directing in Charlotte a humanities project, currently in its proposal stage, which would explore medical ethics.

Despite her long list of activities, Kuykendall believes that the working equilibrium she shared with her husband at Auburn has shifted now. She was a conference coordinator there, yet now she has no official position. And, of course, her husband's workload has grown considerably. “It used to be equal,” she says. “But now mine is almost nil while his is 24 hours.”

**F&M cooks, Fannie Brandon (right) and Mable Torrence**College will not assume responsibility for any debts F & M might have, he said. If necessary, members would be assessed for those debts. Some members plan to join Emanon spring term or to eat at the proposed all-women’s eating house next year. Others will eat at the Commons or on their own. The implications of F & M’s closing for co-ed eating on Patterson Court are not clear. Schwenke said there is a “strong link” between the house and the FIJI fraternity in people's minds. She said a decrease in FIJI pledges has been part of the problem of decreasing membership. She also feels that the trend is toward single-sex eating. “There is less diversity on the court,” she said. Currie also sees a trend toward single-sex houses, but added that F & M, with its association with FIJI, is a special case. Emanon president Sid Jones, who called the closing a “real tragedy,” said he feels that co-ed eating will always be a part of Patterson Court. Emanon, he said, is currently stable with 65 to 70 members. He added there is always the need to actively solicit new members. PAX President Murray Simpson said, “There is a good market of people interested in what co-ed eating houses offer.” He stressed the need for enthusiasm in working to attract interested people.

Panel Evaluates Task Force’s Race Report
By DAVID McGEE

A Reaction Panel has completed its evaluation of the Task Force on Racial/Ethnic Concern’s report, which was released in December. According to the Reaction Panel, “The report [by the Task Force] is a bold undertaking for which the Davidson College administration and the Task Force should be commended. Our overall reaction was that the report was intellectually honest and identified many of the problems that must be addressed. The report clearly points out that previous efforts in this area have not been as successful as they could have been if they had been aggressively implemented.”

The Reaction Panel included persons outside Davidson who are associated with the College and residents of the town of Davidson. “We concluded,” the Panel's report says, “that the Report was developed against a background of historical resistance to dramatic change and with the full view of how much could reasonably be expected to be achieved.” The Panel calls for Davidson to “specify more clearly” the objectives it has to improve minority students’ experience here. “These objectives should include numerical goals with target dates for accomplishing these goals. We believe that this is necessary in view of the inadequacy of past efforts.”

One area of concern includes the Admissions and Dean of Students offices. Both offices, the report says, “are primarily responsible for implementing many of the proposed strategies of the report, yet these offices, in our view, share much of the responsibility for the present state of affairs.” For the Admissions department to achieve its objectives, “resources, both dollars and people, must be increased dramatically in order for the recruiting program to be successful,” according to the report.

In addition, the Panel urges the College to improve its relations with Davidson's black community through establishing a Community Advisory Council which would voice concerns among blacks in town to President John Kuykendall. The panel said Davidson could overcome obstacles in recruiting more black students by developing resources that presently are not used, “such as the ROTC department scholarship recruiting program. There was little evidence, except in the Athletic department, that urban area high schools have been visited or networked to any significant degree.”

About Dean of Admissions John Griffith's minority recruiting goals, the Panel said, “we believe if he is supported by resources the minority student recruitment will be among the best in colleges.”
