**Crunch-time concerts relieve midterm stress**

**Jazz Ensemble impresses small crowd**

By Nick Paut
Staff Writer

In a rare opportunity missed by almost the entire Davidson student body, the lost art of jazz ensemble was performed
in the 900 Room just prior to Spring Break by the Johnson C. Smith Jazz Ensemble. Unlike the solo or
small group jazz performances that are more prevalent in our day and age, the jazz ensemble consists of a larger
group of mostly brass instruments. With their mellow blues highlights and soft jazz beat, the group provided an excellent atmosphere
to escape from the pressure of midterms and packing.

I am not an authority on jazz music, but I found myself in excellent company with our ex-SGA president Bill
Gullan, who has his own radio show dedicated to this genre, on my left. On my right was blues connoisseur
Jason Ferris whose foot tapping and rapt attention were a testament to the quality of the performance. The musicians found
their roots in many different states across the U.S. and their renditions of some of the Jazz Era greats were
excellent. I guess my moment came at the last tune, a personal favorite, “Ride the A.” I would like to
express my thanks to this group for making Davidson the last stop on its tour and my contempt for those
who failed to advertise the event and thereby denied Davidson students some damn fine jazz.

Tuesday, February 27th, Jane Cain, along with the Davidson College Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Richard Prior, delighted the Davidson community
with an organ recital in the Davidson College Presbyterian Church. Cain has been the Director of Music at DCPC since
1979. She has held several positions in the Charlotte area.

**Eddie from Ohio brings the gang to town**

By Matt Fore
Staff Writer

Love, peace, and harmony. The jolly folks from Eddie From Ohio played to a packed 900 Room last Monday. Legs
dangled from the balcony and people sweated in the standing-room-only mob. My first glimpse of the band proved that they
were a fun group. Robbie, who looked like the director of the youth group at church, was hopelessly balding and
frighteningly zealous in his guitar playing and vocals. Squirrel-cute Julie was equally enthusiastic, slapping her sides to the beat while
smiling and singing perkily. Long-haired Mike also supplied vocals, comedy, guitar, and the occasional harmonica. The namesake of the band,
drummer Eddie, was the most serious and least talkative as he slapped away at his leisure. Eddie spoke through the
drums, providing an orgasmic, prolonged drum solo, finishing up by slapping the flanks and neck of Robbie’s guitar.

The crowd loved the show. Students danced, swayed, shared gorp, and called for requests. The three males’ voices blended like
a barber shop quartet, while Julie’s sweet voice serenaded. It was a toe-tappin’, thigh-slappin’, acoustical rhythm good time. The Grateful
Dead influence was obvious. They don’t try to hide this fact, for they appropriate the Dead’s skull image on their
t-shirts. To the audience’s delight, along with playing original material, they covered happy tunes like the Indigo Girls’ “Closer to
Fine,” Lyle Lovett’s “If I Had a Boat,” and an unidentifiable James Taylor gem. Most exciting was their acoustic rendition
of Motley Crue’s classic glam anthem “Shout at the Devil.” As a favorite among students, the band promised them a
good time. Toward the end of the set, they played the tunes of popular TV shows like “Green Acres” and
“The Brady Bunch.” To pay their respects, they cutely changed the lyrics of “Green Acres” to “Davidson is where I’d
like to stay.” The show was all...about fun. The players love what they are doing, and it was obvious that
they would have played all night if asked. During the final tune, Julie exclaimed, “We don’t know how to get
out of this song!” When all the metallic rhythms and booty-shakin’ beats were over, the crowd left elevated and happy.
It’s great to be alive, man.

Book Review
Traveling Europe on 84¢ a Day
By Paul-Robert PALMER
Guest Writer (The Brock Press)

Most copies of Gil White’s Europe on 84¢ a Day will no doubt become well-traveled and dog-eared as their owners
use them to navigate Europe and employ his advice. “I simply plucked the ‘84¢’ out of the air to drive
home the point that you don’t need thousands of dollars to go to Europe,” explains the author. “Too many students
try to measure their fun by how much money they can spend rather than budgeting and exploring the country creatively.”

White’s formula for reducing major expenses is simple: the traveler should possess enthusiasm, an interest in meeting the people, trust
in people, and more importantly, the willingness to return the hospitality by performing simple chores such as washing dishes, baby-sitting,
milking cows, or by offering gifts such as stamps, t-shirts, or cassette tapes. This ‘trade-off’ allows the traveler not only
to reduce the costs, but more importantly gain greater insight and understanding of the people and the country.

Europe on 84¢ a Day is back by popular demand, revised and updated for the ‘90s and is the most
creative and adventurous travel book to come along in years — unlike other travel books that offer only the nuts
and bolts of travel (hotel and restaurant addresses, museum opening times). The author also presents many methods that female travelers
can employ to stay safe, while still having as much fun as the guys. Among his precautions are taking advantage
of university ride boards, cycling, or using companies that arrange rides for you.

“The biggest mistake you can make is to buy a Eurail pass for the entire trip. Take the trains and
stay in youth hostels for the first three weeks and as you gradually gain confidence, branch off into my more
creative ideas,” says the author. He recommends leaving your options open, cycle one day, hitch the next, take a train
or bus, camp, stay in vacant hotel staff rooms or with a farmer, or a university student. Some of his
most useful travel tips are truly entertaining and insightful which will provide the best memories of your trip. Imagine getting
rides by using the “You’re on the Air” (being on a radio station) method, the ‘New Wave-Switch-Over,’ the ‘Wrong-Sign-Right-Road’ method,
and even ‘Yacht-Hiking’ along the French Riviera.

By covering 36 countries (Western and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa), the author provides information on places
you might not expect to travel. He offers practical tips on what to take, and for each country, White provides
the best festivals, best scenery, the must-see tourist sights, nightlife, history, and peculiar customs. The author says traveling can sometimes
be overwhelming and by providing the ‘best’ of the country, the student can plan the day better if he or
she is pressed for time.

Actually, the book is two books in one, with the listing of over 3,000 youth hostels and their telephone numbers
— all located on over 130 country and city maps. Indispensable are the traditional phrases in 20 languages, as well
as the specific phrases for getting accommodations, food, or rides. “You may be too tired to cycle to the next
town, so open the book to the phrases in German which explain to the farmer you would like to work
for a few hours in exchange for a bed, two meals and see 846 on page 12.
