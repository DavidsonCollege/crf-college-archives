**Staff Editorial**

Historically, college has been a refuge from war. Enrollment in higher education is regarded highly enough in this country to
be grounds for special draft status—and fortunately so.

Davidson, though, is participating in a different kind of deferment of duty: dodging the debate. Despite loud warnings from both
the White House and the national media of a potential military conflict with Iraq, students remain overwhelmingly oblivious to world
affairs. While issues of The Davidsonian in decades past have trumpeted headlines of campus protests, today’s apathy makes for far
less engaging news stories.

Progress, thankfully, is underway. Monday night’s peace vigil was an important first step. But there are others to make. There
are people on campus who strongly support U.S. military action against Iraq, and their voices need to be heard as
well. Indeed, there are many who have questioned their political leanings since Sept. 11. Any number of perspectives stand to
be shared and to be learned from.

Ironically, and unfortunately, the current atmosphere of political correctness and acceptance on campus has stifled the very diversity it seeks
to protect. Our generation believes that everyone is entitled to his or her opinion. This is true. However, everyone is
also entitled to voice his or her opinion.

There are big questions to be asked right now. Should the United States intervene in Iraqi affairs? Are UN rules
being violated? What is the United States’ role in world affairs? How has that changed in the last year? Is
that a just change? Will this be a just war?

No one expects to find definitive answers to these questions. The debate, however, needs to start, not only in the
meetings of College Democrats and Republicans or in the Perspectives section of the newspaper but at lunch tables, in dorm
rooms, and in classrooms.

The state of international affairs is not all that’s at stake; the very principles of higher education are in danger
when students fail their most important course—citizenship.

**Criticism of Court unwarranted**

In response to “Frats create artificial relationships,” (Letter, Joe Taylor, Oct. 9).

I found it extremely disappointing to read yet another letter defaming the fraternity system and Patterson Court. Perhaps more objectionable
is the fact that the letter was written by a first-year student who, by my count, has been allowed on
Patterson Court for all of four weeks.

I challenge the writer and all first-year students to actually meet the brothers instead of mindlessly repeating the hackneyed “All
Fraternities are Evil” mantra that seems to be the stance of the “progressive” element here. In many instances, they’re the
leaders of this campus, not some “cookie cutter frat boys.” Over the past year, the fraternities on the Court have
raised thousands of dollars for charity and hosted speakers on important real-life issues, among many other things.

I won’t say that fraternities are without faults, but saying the relationships formed within them are entirely artificial is a
bold-faced fallacy, uttered by someone who has no credentials to be making such a judgment. No one is forced to
go down to the Court, so if you don’t like it, don’t whine about it. Find something else to do.

This campus has been plagued by “enlightened” proselytizing far too much. We’re all mature enough to make decisions for ourselves.
Anyway, I’m going back to preying on unsuspecting freshmen so my pseudo-friends and I can have bodies to fill the
chairs at brother meetings next year.

**Attn: freshmen: don’t slam what you don’t know**

In response to “Frats create artificial relationships,” (Letter, Joe Taylor, Oct. 9).

I would like to take this opportunity to oppose the notion that Patterson Court fraternities such as mine use the
vulnerability of freshmen to lure them to our houses. It is true that we are now actively recruiting new members,
but unlike fraternities at larger schools, we are not simply trying to protect ourselves from the rest of the campus.

I don’t know if you are a person who feels left out while others on your hall (automatic freshmen social
group) have been rushing, and frankly I don’t care. Instead of insulting you like many others would, I challenge you
to try it for yourself. Come down to the Court, meet some brothers and girls, and hear the bands.

Davidson fraternities have a semester-long rush for this very purpose. (Pledging doesn’t start until next semester.) My fraternity in particular
is quite diverse in its characters. No cookie cutter could have produced us, and I’m proud of that. Fraternity brothers
here are best friends, the type that stay to watch senior brothers graduate instead of starting summer a few days
early. This is something everyone should experience.

Sometimes I feel sorry for those who don’t give it a chance. Why else would we spend thousands on bands
and beer and allow open our parties to the entire campus? It’s because everyone should see the Court for what
it is, a truly unique collegiate social experience. Joe and friends, come on down. You're always welcome.
