VAUGHAN GONE ‘TIL SPRING FROLICS Volume XXXVII The een SALENDA LUX OBI OCRTA LIBERTAS DAVIDSON, NORTH CAROLINA, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 19,
Top Band Sought For Spring Frolic By RALPH ROBINSON

Indications are that the Pan Hellenic Council will secure one of the nation’s top-rate bands for the annual Spring Frolics.
By ARNIE COVELL

The annual Queens Davidson presentation of the Christmas portion of the “Messiah,” the famous oratorio by Handel, will be performed
twice during December by the choral societies of the two colleges. The performances will take place on Sunday afternoon, December
5, at the First Presbyterian Church of Charlotte, and on Monday evening, December 6, in the Chambers Auditorium. The choruses
will be accompanied by an augmented orchestra from Charlotte, and the concert master will be Mr. James Hibbard. The soloists
for the occasion are: Mary McGuinn, mezzo-soprano; Virginia Chisholm, tenor; and Berg, baritone.

Concerning a financial statement of the council's treasury after the Homecoming dances, Scruggs has stated that he is not ready
to release a statement until all the bills are received and accounted for. The usual precedent has been to apply
the profit made on Homecoming in hiring a big-name band to play for our Midwinter dances. This year the Pan
Hellenic Council, with the support of the student body, has decided to have the “name” band for the Spring Frolics.
The council was able to engage the Charlotte Armory for Spring Frolics, but was unable to rent it for Midwinters.
As a consequence, Midwinters will be held at the Morris Field Gymnasium, which is much smaller than the Armory and
consequently very crowded during the dances.

It is the opinion of the Pan-Hel and the student body that the “big” band in the Charlotte Armory would
be more enjoyable than in the Morris Field Gym. Scruggs was particularly emphatic in saying that this did not mean
we would have some second-rate band for the Midwinter dances. On the contrary, he promises to have a fine band,
but it will be separate from the Spring Frolics band. The tickets for the set of dances should be around
$4.00, and this is sufficient to adequately cover all expenses and assure a good band.

The Spring Frolics will be entirely devoted to a noted band. As yet, the Pan-Hel has not contracted the bands
for the two remaining dances, but the prospects are favorable. Contacts have been made with several booking agencies for both
the Midwinters and Spring Frolic dances. One matter which has to be taken into consideration is the financial aspect of
hiring a top band.

The student body hails the decision to have a top band for the Spring Frolics. The Pan-Hel is working diligently
to ensure that the dances will be a success and enjoyable for all.

This cleaned text maintains the original meaning and punctuation while correcting OCR errors.The meeting was called to order by the
president. Pictures represent a particular period, as for instance the G. I. book and baby, and the Centennial. The "Y"
Cabinet stood on their heads and whistled "Dixie" (in harmony), to the pouring forth of those sweet, meaningless nothings into
unreceptive ears. The dance that evening was off and dashed forward to the dining hall (possibly, due to intermittent weather).
The main street was a country road that was thick with dust in summer and deep in mud in the
winter.

John Hetesoming, Hugh Farrior, and Tom Moore led the brief devotional. When the roll had been called and the minutes
of the last meeting read, John Iyles made a report on correct debate procedure. The meeting was then turned over
to the program committee which presented a mimic radio program take-off on Fan. The officers of the society were Bill
Mebane, Newton, T. Gin, Criecan, and J. D. Ashmore, historian.

STUDENT LEADERS DENOUNCE DEPLORABLE CHAPEL CONDUCT

In a call meeting of the Student Body Thursday morning, November 11, the very important matter of chapel conduct was
brought forth by President Carl. Students had requested Shepperson to suggest that prayers in chapel not be read, but be
spontaneous, given by the speakers. The last speaker, Mike Williams, told the student body that he believed chapel conduct needed
to be observed while at Davidson. He said that during the dry seasons of the year, the ghost of Old
Chamber the old columns would appear on the lawn, where they stood.

The officers of the society Rica M. Ell, Ronny Dietrich, vice president, and J. D. Ashmore, historian, presented a recital
on Monday evening, November 15, in Chambers auditorium. Mr. Robert P. Noehren, Mr. James Christian, and Mr. Buren Nading of
the Music Department of Davidson College presented a recital on Monday evening, November 15, in Chambers auditorium. The recital included
"Ceremonial Music" of Henry Purcell. Mr. Pfohl’s interpretation of the "Voluntary on the Doxology" was particularly impressive because of its
relation to the familiar church music. Also included in the trumpet program were: "Voluntary," "Trumpet Tune," and "Trumpet Symphony."

The main issue brought up during the business meeting concerned the program in chapel. Gene Bingham, after relating a report
on the fact that chapel is held primarily as a devotional period for the student body, decided that the society
would present the aforementioned program in chapel in the near future.

After the reports of supervisors and critics, the meeting was adjourned.

The forecast for Davidson and vicinity calls for partly cloudy and mild Friday afternoon with chances of showers, followed by
partly cloudy and colder Friday night. Saturday will be fair, windy, and much colder. Sunday will be clear and cool.
Temperatures Saturday night will be near 23-25 degrees, rising to near 55 degrees Sunday afternoon. Protect car radiators Saturday night.
