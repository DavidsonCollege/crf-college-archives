**Casting back into the past**

**John Montague brings poetry, humor, and a part of himself to campus**

By Mary Laura Moretz

Irish poet John Montague began his reading last Monday night by holding up his new Collected Poems with his picture on the cover and saying, “That’s me.” He went on to read some of his most loved older and new poems, including “The Trout” and “Crossing.” The filled 900 Room sat entranced as he interspersed poetry with history and personal anecdotes in his deep Irish tones. Montague remained in the Union for several minutes after the reading, taking requests, answering questions, and signing copies of his Collected Poems. The collection includes a whole range of his work, from the 1950s through the present, and from books like The

**CD Review | Cocteau Twins sound heavenly**

By Mary Forge
Special to The Davidsonian

I paid $12 for four songs that make up the new Cocteau Twins CD entitled Twinlights. When I heard that they had produced a new CD, I expected it to sound like their last release, Four Calendar Cafe, with thick, metallic guitar chords, mesmerizing bass, and the usual siren voice of Elizabeth Fraser. Over the years, they have become more technical, able to manipulate just the right amount of electronics for soothing effects. I was anxious to hear their latest advances.

When I put it in the CD player for a trial run, I heard a piano. I thought, maybe just this first song has piano. Nope. The entire CD is like an unplugged album. At first, I was upset because I enjoy the swirling guitars and the entire electric, flowing ambiance that they had come to embrace. I found, however, that the minimalist nature of the CD is to the band’s advantage. In Twinlights, Elizabeth Fraser’s voice is the key instrument, backed by her husband Robin Guthrie’s simple, but heavenly guitar strumming and plucking, as well as piano, bells, and the scarce and barely audible synthesizer. The instruments serve only to keep time and add to the songs’ moods that Fraser creates.

For fans of the band (I realize that only about 12 people on campus are familiar with them), those pretty guitar chords and bells that evoke their usual atmosphere of calmness are the same as they always have been. This CD is classic Cocteau Twins, just presented in a new way. The first track, “Rilkean Heart,” has that quality of many of their songs by sounding somehow familiar. My favorite track, “Golden Vein” confirms Fraser as the angelic vocalist with the most beautiful voice I have ever heard (Enya included), while Guthrie’s chords continue to be the dreamiest. This is truly overwhelming music. It is hard to believe her voice is human and the melodies man-made. It ranks up there with Portishead as ideal

It almost sounds like a bad joke. I can picture some movie executive getting out of bed one morning and having this wonderful idea: “Let’s redo the Scarlet Letter, but let’s do it with Demi Moore as Hester Prynne so we can throw in some steamy sex scenes. Let’s make Dimmesdale a sav-ior of the Indians. Best of all, let’s make Chillingworth a real bad guy by having him scalp some people!!! Think of it as Dances With Wolves meets Indecent Proposal meets Silence of the Lambs. How could it possibly go wrong?” It goes wrong in almost every possible way imaginable. This may just be the English major in me speaking, but I think that the original was a damned good piece of writing. Nathaniel Hawthorne’s novel, set in the Puritan ~ See A on page 12

Halloween scares up some cutting edge fashion

By Mary STEPHENS
Staff Writer

Sometimes things work out. The first major Halloween party of the season most definitely worked. As The Davidsonian Halloween talent scout, I feel the urge to warn anyone who plans to buy a witch's cap at Rose’s or just use a sheet for that oh-so-clever toga look: you will only embarrass yourself and your friends. Halloween will always win out in the hierarchy of creative holidays regardless of signature Christmas lights or new and interesting ways to make Easter Egg trees because Halloween forces one to reveal the true extent of one’s creativity, humor, and individuality.

Perhaps you are saying to yourself, “Hmmm, this girl not only has an inflated sense of holiday favoritism, but she probably watches Mystery Science Theater, too.” Well, MST3000 is another matter entirely, but not totally unrelated. People need to dress up. Just flip through any Davidson yearbook and not a page goes by where there is not a shot of someone dressed in costume somewhere. Granted that somewhere is usually PiKA’s 70s party.

The problem with Halloween now is that we have unknowingly bankrupted our supply of clever and frightening ideas for outfits. How many more Freddy Kruegers can we have? How many more black cats with tails? That reminds me of the time this little girl at a Halloween party dressed in black tights, black leotard, black ears and whiskers sat down to eat her orange candy-corn cupcake and all of a sudden jumped up and started screaming and crying and still jumping. Everybody thought she had suddenly developed some weird cupcake phobia, but what we didn’t know was that she had actually sat down on a pile of red ants and they had crawled all in her tights.

In developing your creative costume you must be aware of the fine line between too esoteric and too corny. Ideally, you will enter a room and everyone there will know exactly who or what you are, but they will be stunned speechless by your ingenuity. Having to explain your costume seriously weakens the effect. Some of the better costumes this weekend included a smartly dour Georges Sand, a shaved and bleached Susan Powter, a Red Hot Chili Pepper donning the single sock, a droog from Clockwork Orange, and someone who actually thought they could pass as a Wallace Stevens poem.

Be wary of making yourself into a Reservoir Dog or Mia Wallace: very passé. And no one really wants to see another walking enema or tampon although it’s always a crowd pleaser. This year, relinquish the confines of costumes. Dress yourself as a verb, or something totally abstract like ‘trouble’ or ‘silly’ or ‘fundamentalism.’ “Hey! Look at me! I’m a cult!” You may surprise yourself and attract new friends — or better yet, offend the ones you already have. Or if you’re in Rusk, just be a cow.
