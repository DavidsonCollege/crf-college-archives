COL. MUELLER HEADS R. O. T. C. NEXT YEAR

LIEUT.-COL. MUELLER

DAVIDSON R. O. T. C. GOES “OVER THE TOP" IN VICTORY LOAN CAMPAIGN.

In the recent Victory Loan Campaign, instituted by the Government in all R. O. T. C. units, Davidson came out second in this district, with a total subscription of over $89,650. Emory and Henry, of Virginia, came out first, having a subscription of $279,050. This district comprises several states and many colleges participated in this campaign. Most of this subscription was solicited by the students from people in the surrounding community. Four of the cadets were invited to take part in the Charlotte campaign. They solicited $5,000 in Charlotte during this campaign. Due to the fact that Col. Mueller was absent at the beginning of the campaign, the unit was late in starting—otherwise our figures might be twice what they are.

NINE NEW MIMIRS.

At the regular meeting of the Mimir Society Wednesday morning the following men were initiated in recognition of their proficiency in scholarship: A. R. Craig, S. T. McCloy, Emery Flinn, E. G. Lilly, N. Y. Pharr, D. M. Chalmers and A. L. Foscue. Mr. R. F. Kirkpatrick, of Atlanta, was elected to membership as distinguished in letters and education. Prof. W. W. Wood was also elected to membership. The membership for the past year has been from the faculty, Dr. C. R. Harding, Dr. M. E. Sentelle, Dr. J. M. McConnell, Dr. J. L. Douglas; students, W. J. Humphrey, E. A. Woods, and R. B. Peters, Jr.

There was some doubt for a time about the certainty of Lieut. Col. Mueller being in charge of the R. O. T. C. unit here next year. He had been anticipating very strongly a trip overseas to relieve some of the officers that have been on active service for some time. However, we are very glad that his application was refused—and he will be in charge here next year. He will go to Camp Lee about the 17th of June and will be there until the fifth of August. Any student desiring any information regarding the R. O. T. C. here next year or any other matter concerning military training, Col. Mueller will be very glad to receive letters, and answer any question or give any information desired. His program for next year will be: Drill for everybody three times a week—with the exception of one day per month, which will be taken up with a practice march. This march will take the place of three drill periods or a week's work. One or two hour periods each month will be given to short hikes. These will take the place of two drill periods. There will be no recitations for Freshmen from September until January, but they will have three afternoons of 45 minutes each in physical training. There will be many games and other features that will make the training as interesting as possible. Complete equipment will be here by the opening of the college and every cadet will be issued a full outfit. The rifle range will beCompleted by September and target practice will be conducted at certain times. The time spent on the range at target practice will be credited and taken off the regular drill periods. A special plea is made to all men of any musical ability to bring their musical instruments with them and to practice up during the summer. A sixteen-piece band will be organized at the beginning of the year, and all men with any musical instrument suitable for the band are urged to try out. With two Colonels like Col. Mueller and Col. McConnell here next fall, the military feature of Davidson College should be a great success. Fellows, let's get behind these men and do our very best to make the Davidson unit of the R.O.T.C. the best in the south.

TOMORROW
—Edward A. Guest.

He was going to be all that mortals should be, Tomorrow.
No one should be kinder or braver than he, Tomorrow.
A friend who was troubled and weary, he knew,
Who'd be glad of a lift and who needed it, too;
On him he would call and see what he could do, Tomorrow.

Each morning he stacked up the letters he'd write Tomorrow.
And thought of the fellows he'd fill with delight, Tomorrow.
It was too bad, indeed, he was busy today,
And hadn't a minute to stop on his way;
More time I will have to give others, he'd say, Tomorrow.

The greatest of workers this man would have been, Tomorrow.
The world would have known him had he ever seen Tomorrow.
But the fact is he died and faded from view,
And all that he left here when living was through,
Was a mountain of things he intended to do Tomorrow.

19's CLASS GIFT.

The Senior Class gift for the year 1919 consists of a set of light standards placed upon the sides of the steps on the west entrance of the Library. They were made by a Charlotte firm and erected last week. They do much to improve the looks of the building. They are clearly visible from the street and light up the side of the building facing the street. The gift was a particularly fortunate selection. It was presented to the college at the Class Day exercises by Clewell Howell.

I shot an arrow into the air
It fell to earth I know not where,
Until the man on whom it fell
Came round and gave me—information.
