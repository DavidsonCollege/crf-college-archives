Campus Club Honors Graduating Member At Banquet Friday Night

As a prelude to the Spring Frolics dances, the Campus Club on Friday night held a banquet in honor of
their five members graduating this spring. Keynoted by informality, the function was held in the recreation room of the local
Methodist church, with the ladies of the church providing the menu. Bill Suttles was toastmaster. Piano selections were rendered by
David Bridgeman, and Miss Billie Mancin, of Charlotte, presented a toe dance. A quartet composed of Charles Herion, Owen Leland,
Bill Suttles, and Russ Miller, gave forth with the “Tennessee Waltz” in true Spike Jones harmony. The latter part of
the program featured Russ Miller, who, accompanied by Owen Leland at the piano, sang “Home” and an aria from Verdi's
“Rigoletto”. In addition, he presented a pantomime skit which he had lifted from an old TV show, and called on
Bill Suttles for a rendition of “When that Red-Red-Robin Comes Bob-Bob-Bobbin’ Along” that probably made Al Jolson turn over in
his grave and call for “Mammy”.

Toasts were given by Earl Woodall (to the ladies) and the Toastmaster, Bill Suttles (to the seniors), and responded to
by Miss Georgiana Houston, and David Deck, president of the Campus Club, respectively. Honor guests of the evening were Dean
and Mrs. John C. Bailey, and Professor J. H. Ostwalt. In order to avoid conflict with the D-Club Foolies held
the same night, there was no guest speaker. The five members graduating this spring are David C. Deck, Murray Remson,
Jim Templin, Bob Johnson, and Russ Miller.

Graduated From Navy Med. School

Pensacola, Fla., May 3, 1951—Lieutenant (jg) James P. Harnsberger, MC, USNR, graduated from the Naval School of Aviation Medicine recently
and was designated a Naval Flight Surgeon during ceremonies at the Naval Air Station, Pensacola, Florida. Many of the citizens
of Davidson will remember Dr. Harnsberger as he maintained his practice for almost three years there prior to entering the
Navy. He is the son of Reverend and Mrs. Harnsberger, who were present for the graduation and designation of their
son. Their elder son, CDR Tommy Harnsberger, will be remembered by some Davidsonians, too. He was a distinguished Naval Aviator
in World War II, and lost his life in an operational accident in the Jacksonville, Florida area shortly after the
close of the war. Dr. Harnsberger and his wife, following the completion of his flight training, have reported to his
new duty station with the Commander Air Forces, Atlantic Fleet, Norfolk, Virginia.

“Caesar” might be only the first in a series of period plays. “We hope to, next year, start to produce
some of Ibsen, Johnson, Moliere, and the best of the Elizabethan playwrights in an attempt to build up a repertory
company, which might, through reason of their experience, be able to produce more often and more professionally any experimental plays
which we might choose.” He also praised the diligent behind-the-scenes work of production manager Bob Gay. Assisting them are production
assistants Joe Mattison and T. W. Aldred, while Jack Pietenpol is directing the lighting. Bill Bryan is handling the sound
and makeup, Ted Dan- and...Gay, the iels, the programs, publicity. Other students in the cast are Don Reid, Popilius; Bob

jury must go to the state superior court at Statesville subjecting the defendant to the possibility of higher court costs
and inconvenience. As we understand it, this situation is peculiar to the court at Mooresville and one wonders why. While
the fine stands excessively high, it still stands; and while there is inconvenience and extra cost in a jury trial
in superior court, it seems there is going to remain that inconvenience and extra cost to those who would speed.
All violators should pay for their violation. But there should be a scale rather than a blanket with which the
price is set for the particular offense. Unless he wanted to add to his May miseries, the Davidson student who
would go North this week went with a light foot or a heavy purse.
