The owner of a “partial passive solar home” asked, “Can we live in close harmony with nature?” We can, he
said, work with nature to warm our homes by passive solar means.

Village Store proprietor Mr. Taylor Blackwell remembered, “When electricity became plentiful in the ’30s, you weren't fashionable if you didn’t
use electricity. Electricity overcame the old fire in the hearth. Now, it is interesting to see a change. It’s now
fashionable to use a woodstove or a fireplace.”

For a passive solar home, “sunlight is a helping factor, but a bigger factor is insulation. Once the energy has
been trapped, one has to carefully conserve that energy by good insulation.”

Mr. Blackwell’s son, Waller Blackwell, is building a Timberpeg solar home. Waller says that the solar components of this house
will supply 85% of the winter heat. An unusual component of this house is a continuous “blanket of insulation” which
is not interrupted by the traditional studs in the walls. This house is characterized by two solar collection areas on
the south side, a greenhouse, and a two-story “sunspace.” In the basement under the greenhouse is the rock bed heat
storage area. Heat collected in the “sunspace” is blown through the ductwork to the rock bed storage and dispersed to
the interior of the house.

From July to November of last year, Religion Professor Dr. Kaylor built a greenhouse on the south side of his
home in order to supplement the heat from his wood stove. He did the construction himself using the Solar Greenhouse
Book as his guide. Before the addition of his greenhouse, he burned four to five cords of wood per winter.
Last winter he burned only two to three cords of wood. But “I am not finished yet,” Dr. Kaylor said.
“I would like to get a better
