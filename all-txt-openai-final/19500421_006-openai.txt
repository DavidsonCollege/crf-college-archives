Charlotte Waffle Shop in which this religion operates, whereby it regiments and limits academic freedom, not to mention critical inquiry
into religious matters. It is difficult to see wherein this religion differs much from a totalitarianism. A religion that sets
up restrictions to a man’s religious life (and if it restricts religion it usually goes on to restrict other phases
of life) has of necessity to set up some system for dominating its constituency, because only as it dominates can
it survive. There is a third type of religion that is not to be confused with the other two. It
is identified by its commitment to a supreme and living God. This religion asserts that nothing on this earth can
completely comprehend or adequately represent God. Creeds, dogma, doctrines, etc., can only partially incorporate into their structures the meaning and
significance of God, because God is inexhaustible. God has never had his picture taken, and He is not to be
confused with preachers, theologians, professors, or any ecclesiastic. Essentially, this religion is prophetic. Like the prophets’, it is a religion
of reform and social change. It would counteract the blasphemy of confusing God with man-made contrivances. It exerts its criticism
on all forms of religion. Nothing human is exempt from its scrutiny. The institutional church, for example, even though it
is recognized in some circles as the domain of God, has no esoteric aim. It has no monopoly on the
grace of God or His will. It can only bear witness, issuing a call to repentance and exhorting men to
be open to the working of God in the human heart. Everything human is finite; everything finite is

March 6, 1945. Then, it was revealed in court, he had left the State. Also, about that time the FBI
began looking for him on the charge of drawing allowances to which he was not entitled. Jones returned to North
Carolina about two months ago and was picked up promptly on the fraud charge and placed in jail. Records of
the Employment Security Commission reveal that Jones had signed claims for unemployment benefits for the weeks ending January 2, 9,
16, 23, and 30, during which time it developed that he was serving the 30-day jail sentence in the Caldwell
County jail. The prison guard either allowed him to go alone, or accompanied him, to the Lenoir employment office to
allow him to sign the claims each week. At any rate, the claims interviewer taking the claims had no intimation
that Jones was serving the term while filing claims for benefits. Information is that the prison guard who allowed Jones
to visit the employment office has since died.

school teachers will be limited largely to replacements for the next few years. After 1952, enrollments will probably rise slowly
for the following three years and then increase rapidly into the 1960s. Over the 1950 decade, close to 85,000 new
teachers may be needed to handle increased enrollments. In addition, from 17,000 to 20,000 replacements may be required each year
during the 1950s. However, unless high school enrollments are considerably greater than seems probable on the basis of past trends,
a training rate as high as that in 1949 would continue to produce an oversupply of secondary school teachers even

is blown back into the atmosphere without effect.” Furthermore, the smoke is dirty. Electrification has many advantages over steam and,
in most situations all over the world, over diesel engines and turbines, the experts declare. They add that “once atomic
energy has reached the position where it can deliver very cheap electric current, the majority of the world’s railways may
become electrified.” The electrified railways, the article points out, have lower operating costs than steam and lower

some way is distorted of its real significance, meaning, and purpose. Now to answer the question! The religion that has
the most in common with higher education is the third type, because this type champions the cause of higher education
and the things for which it stands. As with higher education, it is not hostile to free inquiry and the
critical temper. Now, by critical temper I don’t mean cynicism or skepticism, but rather a healthy inquisitiveness that continually asks
questions in order to know and understand. With Jesus, this religion believes that the truth shall set you free. It
is convinced of the wisdom of keeping all propositions open to investigation, inquiry, and research. In its desire to be
at least intellectually respectable, it says that a man’s religion, politics, science, etc., are not a closed book with the
final facts in print. It knows that new facts and ideas are being born each day and that they can
be used, so long as they contribute to man’s clearer understanding of himself, human experience, and man’s relation with God.
Furthermore, this religion seeks to orient, interpret, and integrate human experience so that men can enter into relation with the
deepest and most powerful forces of life. Only in this way can it save a man from fanaticism and obscurantism.
However, it would always warn men of their propensities to self-deception and the infirmities of the flesh to which they
are so susceptible. It reminds men that they are not as smart as they think, and that, as Paul says,
“... the weakness of God is stronger than men ... the foolishness of God is wiser than men.”

Just as much as education needs religion, so religion needs education. Religion will have to be more educational if it
is going to ask education to be more religious. Ralph Sockman says that it's a wonder more college students don’t
lose their religion, particularly when the only prayer they have learned is, “Now I lay me down to sleep ...”
'Tis true that religion has too often flogged the will instead of feeding the mind. A parochial religion seems out
of place amid the vastness and interdependence of the universe, not to mention the sphere of higher education. The new
insights of the sciences and philosophy will not shake the foundations of a deep religious faith; they will only serve
as means to a greater appreciation of and sensitivity to the working of God in human history. There need be
no enmity between religion and higher education. Both are fighting for decency, justice, and freedom. They know the threat of
authoritarianism. And they both are aware of the fact that a patient and tender cultivation of the healthy aspects of
religious faith will be a saving power of our civilization.
