THE DAVIDSONIAN, MARCH 10, 1927

[ALUMNI NEWS]

Alumnus Writes of Activities in East

The following letter from W. P. Parker was received the other day by J. F. Pankney, president of the student
body:

Pyengyang, Chosen, Korea,
February 11, 1927.

Dear Davidson Boys:

Naturally, the first thing I want to do is to congratulate you on the State championship in football. It may
seem a tardy congratulation, but you must remember that I am a long way away. Davidson men everywhere are rejoicing
with you and want you to know that this victory means as much to them as it does to you
there. May greater things come.

Then I want to say how proud we all are of Davidson and its record in every way. We are
glad to see the college go forward and hear all the good news that comes to us from time to
time. May God bless Davidson always, and each one of you studying there, and may you each go forward also
in the work that God has for you to do.

As for news from this end, as usual, there is not a great deal of interest to you, perhaps. The
school work goes on as usual, and we have had a good year so far. We send out a fine
lot of seniors in March. Examinations for the graduates begin next week, and commencement is on the 5th of March.
We hope for better things to come and feel encouraged to believe that our science department will get recognition before
many years now. We have waited long, and much patience has to be borne, but we look for success in
the end. As you know, we already have recognition for our literary department. We also hope for recognition for the
Academy here, which is a Northern Presbyterian institution. We are not as near recognition for our Southern Presbyterian Academy in
Chunju as funds that ought to come before very long, too.

The chief topic of conversation this winter here has been the weather, for we have had a hard winter, the
hardest in many years, and the cold is not yet over. As you may know, Korea is classed by insurance
companies as semi-tropical. Judging from the high death rate, I guess they have a right to so class the climate
here, but judging from the thermometer they certainly have no right to do so. Southern Korea is about like North
Carolina and Virginia in climate, but here in Pyengyang, and still more to the North, we have cold weather. The
thermometer goes down to 20 below sometimes. About ten years ago we had a number of 20-below days, and not
so very many years ago we had some also, but the last few winters have been comparatively mild. This year
our cold weather began about the 5th of December. We had 13-below weather then; then again in January, we had
about ten days of 20-below weather. It turned a little milder and we thought the worst was over, but a
week ago it got cold again, and we have been having 15-below nights right along up to and including the
present. I cannot predict when we are to have better days. We have much wind, also, and that is always
hard, but the ground has been covered with snow and ice, and that has been better for us than the
dust we would have had otherwise.

Special meetings begin tonight in the little chapel which I attend. We hope that many will be brought into a
saving knowledge of their Lord during these meetings. We have held our own well at the chapel and have had
good attendance. Recently we have called a pastor who gives us about one-fourth of his time, so that the work
is progressing nicely. Pray for us and all the work that is done. We often think of Korea as evangelized
because the response here has been so wonderful, but after all, only about one in sixty as yet know what
the gospel means in actual acceptance. Most all have heard the Word in some form or other, and only those
in far-off districts are utterly ignorant, but so many have not heard intelligently yet, and there is still much, very
much, to do. Pray for the foreign missionaries, and also for the native Church. We need a revival and long
for one, and know it must begin with us immediately. We could wish, but if we can only get the...

Ten Classes of Alumni to Meet Commencement

Every Five Year Class Since 1877 to Reunite

Every alumnus of Davidson College has a lifelong invitation to return at commencement-time each year, but ten classes are scheduled
for special reunions in June. These are every five-year class, beginning with 1877, the reunion of the latter group marking
the half-century point.

The Alumni Secretary is already making plans to have the largest number of alumni return this year that ever came
back to Davidson at one time. He is particularly anxious to obtain the accurate and correct addresses of those classes
which are listed for return this year, and in order that alumni, faculty members, and students can assist him in
this work, he is planning to publish in The Davidsonian each week the addresses of men in the classes which
will return. If anyone knows about the following men in the classes of 1877 and 1882, they are asked to
notify the Secretary immediately.Classes desired:

RELIGIOUS NEWS

The weekly meeting of the Volunteer Band was led by the President, Billy Rice. The meeting, the object of which
was to gain information of the lives of our missionaries abroad, was very successful. G. F. Houck gave an interesting
talk on the life of John G. Patton, a missionary to the New Hebrides, of the South Sea Islands. He
told of many narrow escapes which Patton had experienced. Once, when entirely defenseless, he was surrounded by cannibals and although
there was no outward hope of escape, he placed his trust in the Lord and came out unharmed.

Billy Rice told of the present situation in China, especially with reference to the missionaries. “The position of many of
the missionaries is doubtful. Those north of Shanghai are in no immediate danger. Many of them have gone to Shanghai
for safety.”

The C. E. Training Class

The Christian Endeavor Training Class was led in its weekly meeting by R. G. Calhoun, assisted by C. R. Pritchett
and W. T. Ratchford. The topic for the day was “Stewardship.” This was expounded by W. T. Ratchford who talked
on “Stewardship in Christian Endeavor” and by C. R. Pritchett who talked on “Stewardship of Time and Money.” Pritchett told
how stewardship could be applied on the campus. We are bound as Christians to give one-seventh of our time to
the Lord. This time can be spent in attending religious services on the Sabbath and by attending the morning watches
held over the campus. People take stewardship of money too much as a matter of course, as it is mentioned
so very often. The great deficit in the Presbyterian Church at this time is a great lesson of how stewardship
has been neglected.

The Ministerial Band

The Ministerial Band was informally addressed by Rev. Hugh Murchison of the University of South Carolina. Throughout the year the
band has been fortunate in getting notable speakers and all have given excellent advice to the future ministers, but the
advice has been on the greater things in life. Rev. Murchison, in a most companionable talk, gave advice concerning the
little things in life which go to make up the man. He said that no man is more noticed than
a young minister. His manners are noticed, his speech is noted, his clothes are noticed, in fact, every little detail
is thoroughly inspected by someone. The minister is set up on a little pedestal where, if he does things that
would not be necessarily harmful to him, he is running a risk of doing things which would influence others to
whom the act would be harmful.

In the business session, it was decided that those men on the campus who have not definitely decided to become
ministers would be invited to attend the meetings of the band and become honorary members, for which there is a
provision in the constitution.

Liggett & Myers Tobacco Co.
Right across the country, NATURAL TOBACCO TASTE has the inside track to smokers’ preference. Chesterfield sales prove it! Natural tobacco
richness without “over-sweetening”; in no other cigarette do men find such naturalness of taste and character. Chesterfield They Satisfy—and yet,
they’re MILD.
