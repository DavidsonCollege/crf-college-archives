Davidson opened the season at Alumni Stadium on Saturday night when they hosted USC-Upstate (0-2). At the onset of the
match, USC-Upstate quickly displayed their offensive talent when they scored at the 1:02 mark of the first half. Nick Buxton
headed the ball off a free kick into the top left corner of the goal to give USC-Upstate an early
1-0 advantage.

Alex Caskey ’11 nearly tied the game at the 27:11 mark on a free kick that missed just above the
post. However, Caskey continued Davidson’s offensive attacks. At around the 36-minute mark, he received a free kick in the box
from Charlie Reiter ’10. Caskey’s initial header was saved, but he was left with a simple two-yard tap-in to tie
the game at 1-1. Despite many close shots and an aggressive offensive attack, Davidson and USC-Upstate went into the half
even at 1-1.

After one player received his second yellow card at the 43:06 mark of the second half, Davidson gained an 11-10
man advantage, giving them an opportunity for a powerful offensive attack. With less than twenty minutes left in the second
half, Peter Paras ’13 scored a goal to put Davidson up 2-1. Yannick Pilgrim ’11 sent a drop pass to
Paras who fired the ball into the left corner of the goal. Paras netted his first career goal at Davidson
and Pilgrim registered his first assist of the year.

Another USC-Upstate player was ejected when he received a red card at the 79th-minute mark, after taking down Pilgrim in
the box when he was breaking away for an open shot. When the match had only a minute left, it
looked like Davidson would pick up their first match of the season with a 2-1 win; however, USC-Upstate would not
give up. USC-Upstate’s Buxton scored his second goal of the evening, heading in a free kick. The game extended into
two overtime periods.

During the overtimes, Davidson kept USC-Upstate’s offense locked down. Davidson had seven shots and held Upstate to zero attempts after
regulation. After 105 minutes of intense play, Davidson sealed the deal as Mark Millard ’12 kicked a shot on goal
that was blocked. Clinton Smith ’10 retrieved the rebound and passed the ball across the goal box to an open
Reiter who easily scored to end the match.

The team stressed that the crowd at Alumni Stadium was crucial to Davidson’s success. “The crowd was unbelievable,” said Josh
Zipin ’11. “The number of people there and their involvement in the match created one of the best atmospheres I
have been a part of since I have been here.”

“The team is feeling great and is ready to move toward more wins,” Reiter said. “We have great team chemistry
this season that will help us through the year like it did last night.”

Davidson improves to 1-0 on the season and will face off in the Adidas Classic against UNC-Asheville at 7 p.m.
on Friday.

Clinton Smith ’10 recorded the game-winning assist in the Wildcats’ 3-2 overtime win.
