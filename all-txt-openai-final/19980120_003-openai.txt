**DAVIDSONIAN: By MICHAEL GILLESPIE Asst. News Editor**

This weekend, following the nakedness of Friday’s court life, a group of students joined a nationwide program emphasizing a different type of exposure. These students participated in Room in the Inn, a project started several years ago in Nashville as an effort to provide nightly accommodations for those in need of them. These Davidson students are being exposed to homelessness, something that is too often, too easily forgotten.

Last winter, the Urban Ministry Shelter of Charlotte began organizing Room in the Inn sponsors in our area. The need for the Room in the Inn project arose out of low temperatures and a lack of adequate, available shelter space during the winter months. The three shelters that normally provide accommodations have found in the previous years that even with emergency accommodations for two hundred additional people, there are still those who get left out in the cold.

Liz Clasen, who discovered the Room in the Inn project while working in Charlotte this past summer, brought the program to the Davidson community last August as a possible campus outreach. This weekend’s visitors will hopefully mark the beginning of a long and mutually beneficial relationship between Davidson and the outside world. This Saturday, Davidson played host to five women from the downtown Charlotte area. Next week’s volunteers will host another five individuals in search of a dry, warm, and safe place to sleep.

Including Davidson’s sleeping quarters offered on Saturday nights, approximately sixty spaces are provided. The Urban Ministry is hoping that this will hold the overflow from the other Charlotte shelters. Davidson alone hopes to host forty-five guests over the next nine weeks. If everything goes well with this spring’s program, next year’s Room in the Inn program could enlarge to provide sleeping space beginning in November. Evidently, the current program mirrors Charlotte’s emergency shelter’s operating calendar. Both programs open their doors to the homeless on December first. The benefit of starting the Room in the Inn project in November of next fall is that the program could then provide for people caught in dropping fall temperatures when there is no space to sleep in the other shelters. Without this service, many people may find during inclement weather that they have nowhere to go.

Clasen has coordinated the Davidson effort, and her group of volunteers has divided itself into three groups of fifteen volunteers each. This past weekend marked the beginning of Davidson’s involvement with the Room in the Inn program. This Saturday’s group was led by Amy Jones, who had high expectations for their first night. Her group began early Saturday afternoon by preparing a place for their guests to stay in the downstairs of Johnston Gym. They then left to pick up the five ladies in Charlotte and returned to our campus for a meal at the Commons. Everything appeared to be running smoothly as the ladies prepared for bed.

Saturday afternoon, as she prepared for the evening, Jones hit upon a crucial element for hosting these individuals. “We just have to treat them as guests.” The biggest obstacle for this outreach program is making the guests feel welcome on Davidson College campus. Amid this close-knit community of sixteen hundred students, the task of the volunteers will be to provide an atmosphere as warm and congenial to these visitors as the room provided for their sleep. Jones believed that her group was up to the challenge, but at the same time admitted, “I can’t imagine going to Commons as an adult.” She emphasized that the stereotypes of homeless persons were often unfairly negative and led people to become anxious around them. Perhaps this new interaction will help the Davidson community to see, as Jones pointed out, that the homeless are normal people beset by problems common to each of us.

Jones said that about half of her volunteers had some experience working with homeless people before, and she expected that both the volunteers and the guests would quickly settle in. They were provided cards and games to encourage interaction as well as a few magazines as reading material. Upon a campus often focused upon its own activities, these five women and the others who will visit us in the coming weeks deserve our warm welcome. While we offer them beds, they provide us with a valuable check on reality outside Davidson. As Jones commented, these people give us “a big glance into the real world.”

**Sororities cited as possible admissions problem.**

Sororities on from page 1 what people say they want, save for one, and that is the issue of historically black fraternities and sororities,” said Vagt. The sorority question on Davidson’s campus is by no means a new one. In a Jan. 30, 1995, issue of The Davidsonian, staff writers Carrie Blackburn and Kerry Albright covered a visit of the National Panhellenic Council to campus, citing the discussion’s turn to “a tense face-off.” The concerns voiced at the meeting by campus reflected the same concerns of the current female population.

The question of sororities came under scrutiny at the start of the semester, with rumors of sorority invitations circulating campus. The question was formally addressed in the September 15 issue of the Davidsonian, confirming this report. After evaluating student interest, the Patterson Court Council approved a measure to begin the process of selecting and introducing sororities to campus. One week later, news came that the Committee for Expanding Women’s Options at Davidson (CEWOD) and the Counsel for Campus and Religious Life (CCRL) intended to postpone a decision on the sorority decision “for at least two weeks.” The decision, in fact, came three months later.

A student/faculty forum on Oct. 22 further aroused campus sentiments. The arguments took many forms: sororities would bring an increasingly competitive atmosphere in the exclusivity of the organizations; they would kill the eating house system and would not fit into the climate of Patterson Court. Equally vocal was a minority of women who favored the invitation of sororities.sororities to campus, including Bonner Mead, Cristina Rodriguez, and LaCrystal Jackson. They believed that women could overcome these problems, and that women should, at the very least, be given the option of joining. Many faculty also opposed the presence of sororities on campus. Professor Mark McCulloh stated in his editorial that “extending the Greek system to include sororities at Davidson may be fair, since the option does not now exist for women students. Nonetheless, sorority colonization of Davidson strikes me as a symbolic step backward, not forward.” Few suggestions were voiced for a focus on the specific sororities targeted by the College: Alpha Delta Pi, Chi Omega, Delta Delta Delta, Kappa Alpha Theta, and Kappa Kappa Gamma. The CEWOD chose the sororities with the belief that they “fit best with Davidson tradition and women’s eating houses.” Presentations by the individual sororities were slated for November, though such plans failed to materialize on a campus-wide basis. “I think that if we’d had some kind of educational process, things may have been different, but I don’t know that it would have changed the overall opinions. I think that whole concept (of sororities) in people’s mind is a critical variable,” said Vagt. On Nov. 5, the CCRL met again to vote on their recommendation to Vagt regarding this decision. The result of that vote was a reflection of the mixed opinions on campus: 8 for, 8 against, 1 abstention. A minor concern of the debate focused on the Greek system itself, bringing the tradition of fraternities into question. Vagt said, “There were lots of arguments that fraternities are, and that therefore Greek organizations in particular, anti-intellectual. There were lots of studies cited, but most of those studies were large institutions, much different from us, with residential fraternities and sororities, and I don’t think you can generalize, so there was no real evidence brought that Greek organizations on this campus are any of the above. That was not an issue.” The sorority issue has been one of the primary issues of Vagt’s first semester at Davidson, and altogether, a rewarding experience. “It’s been kind of reaffirming. So many times people complain about an apathetic campus, that options are provided and nobody goes.” “People came to this issue, and articulately and eloquently and passionately. The good news out of it is that people on this campus, when you get something that catches their attention and that they think is important to Davidson, they stand up and say their peace.”

TO THE DAVIDSON COLLEGE COMMUNITY

Apologizing in advance for the excessive use of pronouns in the first person, I would like to explain why I will not invite at this time sororities to come to this campus. I hold the fundamental belief that the right of any group to organize on this campus is not solely a function of popularity, for sentiment about such an issue, while always interesting and informative, should not be determinative. Rather, the only basis for denial is a judgment that the group or its activities may violate the noble aims or the best interests of this institution and its constituent community. After careful consideration of the many points and counterpoints put forward by students, parents, and faculty, it is my judgment that the presence of sororities at Davidson could put at risk one of this institution’s great strengths - that is, the unsurpassed quality, the breadth and depth, of the female applicants for admission. Clear expressions of concern were voiced by the Admissions Office about the potentially negative effect on applications, and this admonition was buttressed by a number of high school guidance counselors who were on this campus several weeks ago. Further, the overwhelming majority of the hundreds of female students, both current and graduated, who made themselves heard, vigorously asserted that the presence of sororities on this campus would have acted as a strong depressant on their interest in attending Davidson. Absent these facts, simple equity would have dictated inviting sororities to organize here. However, we cannot and will not jeopardize imprudently something as vital to Davidson as the caliber of its students.

Please allow me also to note what this decision is not. It is not a reflection of a lack of confidence in the ability of the women on this campus to make judgments for themselves. There was an assertion made that, with the introduction of sororities, women would somehow come under the sway of a well-organized force that would move onto this campus. The truth is, woe betide anyone who underestimates the clear vision and strong will of the women at Davidson.

The Vagt sorority decision

This is also not a judgment about Greek societies in general, nor about fraternities and eating houses at Davidson in particular. While there was considerable heartfelt sentiment about Patterson Court, this decision is not in response to several negative assertions, for which there was produced little or no substantiation particular to this campus.

This decision does leave me quite uncomfortable in one notable aspect. There had been a strong case made in a self-study of less than two years ago that Davidson “should continue its receptivity to initiatives from African-American students who wish to pursue the establishment of a traditionally black fraternity and/or sorority,” in order to meet a need perceived by African-American students which does not seem to be met by any part of the current system. To the extent that this situation continues to exist, we must work to make it better.

This is a decision which will not be pleasing to all. There is an important group of women who articulately endorsed the invitation of sororities to the campus. They and their views are important to this community, and it is with great reluctance that I take a stance inconsistent with their request. In an effort to express this more fully, I would invite those of you who wish to respond to this decision to meet with me in the 900 Room of the College Union on Tuesday, January 13 at 8:00 p.m.

This campus has participated in active debate on an important issue about which there were strong, opposing views. This is clearly not the first such occurrence in Davidson’s history and certainly - even hopefully - not the last. During the course of this exchange, I was aided immeasurably by letters, phone calls, e-mail messages, and notes captured in frost on my office and car windows. While each had a point of view, and most were strongly held, they were identical in one respect - each was sent in a spirit of expression of what is best for Davidson College. This institution is fortunate to command such support. Please accept my thanks for your insight and assistance.
