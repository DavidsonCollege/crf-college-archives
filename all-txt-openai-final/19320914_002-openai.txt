**THOUGHTS IN PASSING**

The exceedingly large registration this year is very remarkable in view of the fact that the depression is still very
much in effect, and attendance in many colleges and universities throughout the country has fallen off to a marked degree.

The abundance of material makes our prospects for a successful football season loom brighter than they have in some time.
Too much should not be expected from the team, however, since we have the most difficult schedule which we have
had for several seasons, and it is not easy for two new coaches to install a different system of football
in just one year.

The decisive victory of Ellsworth Vines, Jr., over Henri Cochet of France in the finals at Forest Hills last Saturday
may mean the passing of the tennis supremacy of the world from France to the United States. Few thought that
the slim American could win from the first ranking player in the world.

A rather large number of Davidson students had the opportunity and pleasure this last summer of viewing the Olympic Games
in Los Angeles. All who did attend the games will long remember this greatest of athletic events.

Those members of the Y. M. C. A. Cabinet who had an opportunity to attend the retreat which was held
last Saturday and Sunday on the Catawba River report an excellent time and are enthusiastic about plans for this year.

The Davidsonian staff takes this opportunity to welcome the new members of the faculty who are taking up their work
here for the first time.

Have your picture taken for the Annual as early as possible. It will save you trouble later on in the
year and will help lighten the work of the Annual staff immeasurably.

With the opening game in football with Duke less than two weeks off, interest will be growing with great rapidity.
We hope that a large number of students will be over in Durham to support the ’Cats.

The Faculty Directory will appear in the Davidsonian in the near future, and we advise all Freshmen especially to preserve
this in order to know where the faculty members live. They are always anxious to receive students in their homes.

**TO THE CLASS OF 1936**

Our first word to you, the members of the present Freshman class, is one of welcome. For most of you
this is a new phase of life, and you will live a life here for four years which will be
different from any other four years you have ever spent or shall spend hereafter. This is essentially true of college
life in general throughout the country, but especially so at Davidson.

The first month of college is naturally bewildering to the Freshmen, but the upperclassmen will do all in their power
to make it easier for you, and we hope the readjustment can be made as quickly as possible.

You will find that friendliness pervades the campus here. All Freshmen are required to speak to every member of the
student body, and this habit is retained by the members of the student body in the upper classes also. This
fine custom causes the members of the student body to be more friendly to one another, and is one of
the first things any outsider notices when visiting our campus. The quicker and more spontaneously each member of the Freshman
class can pick up this habit, the more quickly will he enter the life that is truly representative of Davidson.

Davidson College has a nation-wide reputation for having a student body of gentlemen, and we urge each one of you
to keep in mind the fact that you are a Davidson man, both while you are on and also off
the campus. This is a great heritage, and we are sure that this class of ’36 will do its share
to uphold the reputation of Davidson and strive to carry it to even higher levels.

**SOCIAL FRATERNITIES**

At this time in the college year the thought uppermost in the minds of many of our students, both Freshmen
and upperclassmen, is the question of becoming connected with some fraternity on the campus. This article is directed mostly to
Freshmen and is to be taken generally, and is not to be applied in any specific case. Some of the
new men have a fairly good idea of the full meaning of becoming affiliated with a fraternity, but in many
cases very little is known about the subject.

The different fraternities take time to select the men whom they desire, and the same care should be taken by
the individual men in considering the different groups on the campus. Two weeks is an extremely short time for the
fraternities to become familiar with the different men whom they are entertaining, or for the Freshmen to learn all the
men in any one group, but you should not arrive at your ultimate conclusion by any snap judgment, or what
you may have heard about any group before coming to college. A person will not be equally fitted to enter
just any group, and a mistake may change the whole complexion of your college career. Study the situation as any
problem, make up your mind to the best of your ability, and the result will probably be very favorable.

The expense involved in becoming a member should be looked into, for in some instances embarrassment has been the result
for both the man being rushed and the fraternity, because some obligation could not be met. This should be fully
considered before becoming connected with any group.

To those men who because of financial or other reasons do not affiliate with any group at bid day or
thereafter, you will find that a Davidson man is a Davidson man first and a fraternity man secondly. We pride
ourselves at Davidson on our friendliness to each other as well as to outsiders, and as Davidson is a very
democratic college, the highest positions in a great many instances have been held by men who are not members of
a social fraternity.

Although social fraternities are a benefit to many men, they are a hindrance to others, and many times they loom
too large in the eyes of Freshmen. Some men lose sight of the essential aim for which they came to
college and consider their college career a success after two weeks’ time when they have pledged some fraternity. Joining a
fraternity has opened up great opportunities for many men who are able to make the most of them, whereas it
has proven a pitfall to many others. Consider all angles wisely and sanely before taking any step. If at bid
day you do pledge some group, remember that you were taken in to benefit the group and not merely as
an ornament.

**Y VESPERS**

Davidson College, being under the direction of the Southern Presbyterian Church, has always required the members of its student body
to attend certain religious functions. There is one service, however, at which the attendance is not required, and which is
very popular with students on the campus. This is the Y Vesper Service held every Sunday afternoon after supper. The
hour is most convenient and does not interfere with the church service later on in the evening. The upperclassmen know
the value of attending these services, because no one attends who does not so desire, and as a result all
are in a very worshipful spirit.

The services are under the direction of the Y. M. C. A. here at Davidson, and in the past, men
of the highest caliber have been obtained from all over the South to speak before the students, and plans have
been made to procure excellent men for this year. These men are not chosen from any one group, and as
a result a great many men in different walks of life come to Davidson each week. Among these we have
also had many members of our own faculty to speak to us from time to time. To the Freshmen who
have not yet been to one of these services, we urge you to attend as they offer an opportunity for
worship, peculiar in that most of the speakers are not of the ministry and the attendance is entirely voluntary.

**WORLD SPECTATOR**

I SAW

The Republic of Haiti will be rid of United States’ intervention sooner than it has up to this time expected.
According to the treaty with Haiti in 1916, the United States was to withdraw its military organization from Haiti.By 1936,
but with the signing of the new treaty, this withdrawal will be completed by December 1934. In place of the
marines, who are now stationed in Haiti, a United States military mission will be on the island for the purpose
of training a native guard. This, too, will be withdrawn when it is found that the natives are sufficiently trained
to guard themselves. Because of the fact that $14,150,000 worth of Haitian bonds are out, the United States will direct
the financial side of the republic until these are retired. American intervention in Haitian finance will also protect the interests
of American securities. This intervention will take the form of a Fiscal Representative and a Deputy Fiscal Representative nominated by
the President of the United States and appointed by Haiti. It is hoped that every phase of intervention will be
withdrawn by 1942.

Mount Everest, the highest mountain in the world, and as yet unclimbed, will be tackled next year by a party
of the English Royal Geographical Society under the leadership of Hugh Ruttledge. Ruttledge, because of his age, will probably not
be allowed to attempt the last stage of the climb to the as yet unconquered summit. Mount Everest, in the
Himalayas in Central Asia, is 29,002 feet, or over five miles high.

Miss Viola Ilma, a young Quaker girl of New York City, is making plans to publish a magazine for the
youth of today. This magazine will not have any contributors over thirty years of age, thus trying to present the
thoughts and reasonings of the youth of the present day. Among the articles she wants to publish are the views
of a West Pointer on what makes an ideal girl, the ideas of the private secretary of an important business
executive, a discussion of whether voting is a duty, and an Indian prince’s impression of American girls. Miss Ilma has
finished high school, has had several magazine contributions published, and has been on the stage.

There are a great many “rackets” in use now, many ways of getting money from unsuspecting citizens, but one of
the newest is the “share expenses auto trip racket.” This system has on the surface all the marks of a
perfectly honest transaction. (And many of the systems are really honest.) The worst form of the racket is for a
driver to advertise for a load of passengers to go to a distant city, say from New York to Miami
or Chicago, collecting his money before the trip, and then leaving his passengers while they are stopping for dinner or
for the night. The victims of this racket have no way to recover their money or prosecute the racketeer. They
are merely left stranded, often without sufficient money to pay for a trip home.

Another method of working this racket, which is not as extremely dishonest but which has a big risk attached, is
that of following out the agreement but making it very risky for the passenger. The lack of insurance makes the
trip less expensive, but with very little safety precaution taken by the driver. The driver either advertises for himself or
is connected with an agency which provides passengers. They are collected and given instructions which are necessary for the trip.
These include the command that the passengers shall, if questioned by officers, speak of themselves as “friends of the driver
who are going with him, sharing expenses.” They are told to deny the fact that they have paid the driver
any money, and to prevent the proof of the payment, they are given no receipt. Thus, the passengers start for
their destination in a car with no passenger transfer license, no insurance, and with no receipt for their fare. The
cars usually used in this racket are very old Packards, Cadillacs, or Lincolns, the names of which give an atmosphere
of comfort and speed to the advertisements. They are just about worn out and it is hard to make them
stand the strain of the trip. They are not insured, so the passengers can collect no damages in case of
an accident. If the car breaks down, the passengers are marooned with the car until it can be fixed. Accidents
are very frequent because the cars are pushed at their maximum speed in order to have them compete with railroads
and buses. The drivers are always tired out and therefore are often unfit to drive a car, especially at high
speeds for long lengths of time.

It is extremely hard for the government officials to control the practice because it is impossible to stop every car
on the highway to find out if it is racketeering. And even if the car was stopped, there would be
no way to prove that the passengers were not friends of the driver, sharing expenses with him on a trip.
Surely there is nothing unlawful about that, and there are a great many people who travel that way in pleasure
and safety. The bus and railroad companies are extremely worried about this way of travel. They are carefully supervised by
the government and are forced to take every precaution and responsibility for the safety of the passenger. The racketeer has
none of this responsibility. As a result, he can give cheaper rates. The legitimate companies have a slight margin of
speed over the racketeer systems, but the extra expenses of bus and rail are enough to make up for the
slightly slower speed of the racket driver. This is a very serious problem which can best be met by the
public. If they refuse to use that form of travel, the racket would soon stop. The only trouble is that
many honest drivers would be forced to stop their business and add their names to the list of unemployed. But
why figure on this sort of solution as long as there are people who will use a thing because it
is a few cents cheaper, regardless of quality or safety in their using it? It is a question, like all
the other rackets, which has not yet been solved.

Moffatt McConnell uptown surrounded by a crowd of listeners. He was telling about his trip to the West Coast. Somebody
asked him if he saw the Olympics. “Sure,” he said, “I had dinner with them.”

A party who told me that John Drake is in Germany. He has been working on boats this summer and
wrote one of my agents he got on the wrong boat and was in Germany at the time school opened.
The latest is that he is waiting for the boat to sail for America.

George Barnes and Hartman Eager in trouble the other night. They were having a friendly argument and got to the
point where they were ready to talk about a wager. I say talk because they were both broke. In walked
a lordly soph and on seeing the trend of events he assumed the role of a member of the student
council for the moment. George had a mental picture of what would happen to him and imagined himself catching a
train for home. In fact, Hartman and George both turned a trifle pale. The situation became less tense when they
realized that it was a practical joke and nothing more. But, I hear that George Washington Barnes had a nightmare
that night.

More boys having their rooms done over. They never have heard of the readjustment or so-called “depression.” I know it
must be nice to have freshly painted walls and floors and we just wish we could afford to do the
same for ours.

Prof. Kimbrough around the place looking like he stepped out of a bandbox. I wonder if he ever read those
books he bought from that pretty little book agent who was here last spring. Prof. Goldiere and Ernest Milton were
sale-proof, but I heard that the math prof. felt that the books would be beneficial even though they do not
contain a binomial theorem or a single geometric progression.

Aleck Schenck and Joe Wadsworth dining with two of the prettiest Charlotte girls at the College Inn Friday night. They
didn’t notice me, they were so busy looking at their beautiful companions, but I saw them and I’m going to
try to meet the blonde. So Aleck better watch out. I’m a wonder with the women.

Hal Harris visiting his alma mater. He has just returned from a summer abroad which was his graduation present. You
ought to hear him tell about the places he visited and the things he saw. Travel’s so broadening. He went
everywhere and saw everything and had a corking good time.

The father of a Freshman came in the office to enter his son in college. After counting the money he
turned it over to our efficient treasurer, Mr. Jackson. “That’s right,” said the treasurer. The father replied, “It ought to
be, we counted it till we nearly wore it out.”

A Freshman talking after one of the speeches given at the orientation program. Our president, Dr. Walter Lingle, had spoken
about spending money wisely. The Freshman said, “There isn’t any need for me to worry about spending money. There are
11 children in my family and spending money is the least of my worries.” And while on the subject of
money we will tell about the elevating force of the depression we heard about. It is claimed that if nothing
else it has taught lots of people to pronounce a three-syllable word.

Charlie Rives waiting at the P.O. to go to the show with Buddy Gardner who was being detained by a
dame in a parked car. Red Stewart walked up and said, “Who’s that girl with Buddy? He ought to duck
her.” “Duck her,” Charlie said disgustedly, “he ought to drown her!”

Somebody asked Parson Peabody why he didn’t go to the Olympics as he planned. Parson claimed that after he got
as far as Alabama he decided if he walked to Los Angeles he would be too tired to climb the
fence, so he gave up the idea of going at all.

Raymond Harrison displaying the very latest in college clothes at Miss Minnie’s. Raymond moved to Lexington, Va., but will be
back every third week to cater to his distinguished clientele here.

This is a note of warning. Don’t do anything you wouldn’t want written up. If you do it will be
too bad—though it will not be little Tip Poff's fault—I told you about it.

TIP POFF.
