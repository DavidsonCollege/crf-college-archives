Terriers and Wildcats Scramble on Richardson
Quarter Reams on Rip Major’s Squad Dangerous—Promise Seats and Dry Field

The Davidson Wildcats return to Richardson Field for the second battle here and for the fourth game of the season,
next Saturday. They will meet one of the toughest foes of the season in the Wofford Terriers, from Spartanburg, S.
C. The two teams are about evenly matched, both teams having a good deal of speed, though the South Carolina
line will probably outweigh the Red and Black. They will put up a mighty struggle, and a large crowd is
expected to witness it. The 3,000 new bleachers have at last arrived and have been put up and everyone will
be comfortably seated.

The comparative scores so far this season give Davidson a little edge over Wofford as the Wildcats’ escutcheon is as
yet untarnished by the stain of defeat, while Wofford has been defeated twice. But both of these defeats were by
especially strong teams. V. M. I. defeated the Terriers 33-0 in the initial game of the season, but they came
back with fire in their eyes and defeated Piedmont College 12-0, only to be set down on the following Saturday
by a 19-0 score delivered by Citadel. The Wildcats have won three games in succession and will strive to make
it four this weekend. The final score will not be large, as both teams have reputations of fighting every minute
of the game, and when two such teams meet the score is always small. The Terriers are determined to even
up their defeats with a victory Saturday and the Wildcats are just as determined to keep their winning streak.

Coach Tex and Monk are changing the team about especially in the line. Flake Laird, who has been starring at
center, will be shifted back to tackle, where he made his letter last season. Joe McConnell, the surprise of the
season, is delivering the goods in first-class condition at the pivot position. His work in the P. C. and Richmond
games has shown him to be of varsity calibre. Sappenfield, the flashy Wildcat quarter, is out temporarily with a bad
knee. Whether he will be back in against the Terriers depends upon how the injury mends. Hendsix stands ready to
fill in at quarter instead of his regular place at half, while Andy Hewlett is pushing him hard at quarter.

Coach “Rip” Major will lead his Terriers into the lair of the Wildcats next Friday afternoon in order that they
may get a good workout and rest before the game Saturday. Coach Major has an excellent defensive man in “Froz”
Reams, the brainy quarter of the team. This man has shown up well in all the games of the season
and is expected to keep up his good work in this game also. The probable line-up will be:

Davidson. Position. Wofford.

The Kick-Off
By Don Wharton

Davidson—thrice outweighed—thrice victors—goal line uncrossed. It seems that the Wildcats just can’t satisfy the sport writers. After giving the Bluestockings
a good drubbing, the papers say the dope was overturned, and now they come out and say we didn’t beat
the Virginians as much as we were doped. It'll be quite a job to treat the Wofford Terriers according to
football etiquette a la “dope-slingers.”

Away back in 1914 the Wildcats and Terriers had a little scrap in which Davidson scored 81 points and the
Terriers crossed the Red and Black goal line for the first, last and only time in history. Since that date
the two teams have met five times and all in all the Wildcats have rolled up 343 points to the
above-mentioned six for the South Carolina teams. The greatest score came in 1921 when Dee LaFar led the Davidson team
to a 87-0 victory. Some around can even remember the play in which Doc, even though he was a guard,
was given a chance to carry the ball over.for a touchdown. Prospects for any such log-rolling scores seem very gloomy
this season. The Flying Squadron from V. M. I. was able to win by only 33 points, being held scoreless
in the last half. Also, the Citadel rang up three touchdowns against the Spartanburg crowd. Do you remember that wonderful
fresh team that Citadel had last season?

The Davidson Freshmen showed great versatility of attack when they won last Friday 19-0 from the Monroe High School team.
The Wildkittens scored in every possible manner—two touchdowns, two points after touchdown, one field goal, and one safety by their
opponents. The game with the Richmond Spiders is the only football contest of this season in which Davidson has not
forced her opponents to score a safety. Five Davidsonians have scored touchdowns so far—Wells, Sappenfield, Black, Hendrix, and Sapp. Captain
Nappy hasn't been out of the game for a minute so far. Sappenfield played every second of the P. C.
game, but Coach Tilson had to drag him off after wrenching his knee Saturday. Nick was going good, and should
he not be in the Wofford game, the score will show the difference.

When Tom Baker came off the field, his red hair flaming and his face bloody and torn, the entire stands
gave him a cheer—it was a cheer for a “first-class fighting man.” Bullock, star backfield man for Trinity, is out
of the game for the remainder of the season with an injured spine. There has never been a cleaner athlete
on Trinity's gridiron or court than Ed, and he will be missed. It would be finer to win and finer
to lose Thanksgiving with Bullock in than out.

The standing of North Carolina football teams and future South Carolina opponents of the Wildcat eleven is as follows:

| Opponents | Won | Lost | Scoring Scores |
| Davidson | 3 | 0 | 36 | 3 |
| Wake Forest | 1 | 0 | 7 | 6 |
| Trinity | 1 | 1 | 33 | 20 |
| State | 1 | 1 | 20 | 8 |
| Carolina | 0 | 2 | 6 | 24 |
| Lenoir | 1 | 1 | 19 | 26 |
| Guilford | 0 | 1 | 6 | 34 |
| Wofford | 0 | 3 | 0 | 90 |
| Clemson | 1 | 1 | 14 | 21 |
| Furman | 1 | 1 | 60 | 12 |
| Wofford | 1 | 2 | 12 | 52 |

Wildkittens Open Season, Defeat Monroe Hi 19-0

Coach Rawson’s Fresh Show Results of Hard Work—Captain Gray Leads Colts

The 1924 Wildkittens opened their season of football by defeating Monroe High School 19-0 at Monroe on Friday, October 3rd.
As a whole, the team showed up well for the first game. The scoring started in the first quarter, when
Dick Gray put a place kick through the bars for three points. The rest of the first half was scoreless,
the ball being in the High School's territory most of the time. The rest of the scoring was done in
the last quarter. On the second play of the fourth quarter, Dick Gray took the ball on a weak side
play for the first touchdown. Five minutes before the end of the game, McGeachy, who had substituted for Nesbit, pushed
the ball across for another six points. Dick Gray put over the points after touchdown. Just before the end of
the game, Red Gray and Ritchie broke through and caught a Monroe back behind his own goal line with the
ball. This netted two points, for a total of 19 points. Dick Gray was the outstanding Kitten, the ex-Davidson High
School boy making 13 of the points scored. Wilson, at quarter, used his head in running the team. McNeil and
Red Gray showed up well at guard. Sutton was good on the defense. Ritchie's work at tackle was also noticeable.
For Monroe, Stewart got off some pretty punts and Captain Wiggs, at tackle, was in the thick of the game.

The line-up:
| Davidson Fresh (19) | Pos. | Monroe High (0) |
| Morton | Right end | Young |
| Ritchie | Right tackle | Bass |
| Baskerville | Right guard | Watts |
| Chatham | Center | Owens |
| Grayson | Left guard | Correll |
| Gibson | Left tackle | Arrowood |
| Wilson | Left end | Morton |
| Nesbit | Quarterback | Stewart |
| Sutton | Halfback | Hallman |
| Gray (C) | Halfback | Wiggs |
| Sapp | Fullback | Monroe substitutes: McNeil for Baskerville; Laws for Chatham; McGeachy for Nesbit; Harrison for Wilson. |
