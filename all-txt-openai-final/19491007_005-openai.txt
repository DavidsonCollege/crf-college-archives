PASSING OF AN ERA...
(Continued From Page Three)

...tion of the group which has ruled the country for nearly seventeen years. There are many, undoubtedly, who are deserving of permanent relief, but there are many more, parasites who take such relief not because they have to, but because they haven’t the intestinal fortitude to do for themselves what others are doing who are in far worse circumstances than they. The administration of the plan has been its prime evil. To cater to such parasites, to take the money of those who are working to provide for their own future, to make wards of the government of such “doers” in order that those who do nothing may have the rewards of the work they have not done, is a monstrous and heinous crime against the honest taxpayer in the name of charity.

5. The use of public credit and of the fiscal machinery to offset the stagnation of private enterprise and to stabilize the economy and maintain employment at a permanently high level. Once the government interferes, it makes necessary more interference and still more interference. For government to try to control and guide something so vast and incomprehensible as the economic system is analogous to a man who knows nothing of clocks and decides to repair his timepiece. He takes off the back, peers in, decides he sees what is the matter, and jams in a crowbar. The clock runs no better; in fact, it runs much worse, so he makes further efforts at repair. Each effort produces a new injury which in turn requires further meddling. In the end, the clock lies broken on the table and what ran tolerably well before, even though not perfectly, now does not run at all. The government is characterized by this would-be clock fixer perfectly. For the government has never run any business at a profit in its history; and yet it proposes to take a vast economic system, correct all of its faults, and produce the perfect system. If to regard the past measures of the government and the basic principles of Marxism to see that the difference is infinitesimal. We are heading down the road to socialism. Does this sound fantastic? It is not the first time that a people have been hoodwinked. It is not the first time that something the people would never hear to, if called by its rightful name, has gained control under some euphemistic title. The New Deal, the Fair Deal; in the end, but too late, we will see that this has been a raw deal, a dirty deal, an infamous and evil deal, administrated by men who have perverted their country’s destiny for petty political and personal motives.

Freedom from implies that, through some agency external to some want. A nation or an individual guaranteed freedom from something is automatically made a chattel such as are common to any individual. Perfection? No! For there will be no progress, only stagnation, and like mud in quiet waters, man will sink down and down, till he reaches the bottom beyond which he cannot go — the level of a mere animal, a slave to a force which has no respect for his nature or desire for his improvement. Responsible choice and is the most undesirable way of giving mankind a freedom. “Freedom to,” on the other hand, implies that it is within the power of the individual himself to achieve freedom from fear, or hunger, or whatever. The individual is free to free himself, not to take the dole of some force to which he sustains the relationship of chattel and slave. Directly linked with this freedom to free oneself is the principle of free choice — “freedom to” followed by responsibility to stand behind that choice. "Freedom to" is infinitely greater than “freedom from,” for it allows the fullest growth and expansion of the human spirit.

Is the “freedom to” being lessened in this country? On every hand...

BILL PETERS — 112 WEST

[with a bad cut over his left eye, By PHIL HAMMOND]

The Davidson JV opened its 1949 season with a resounding 13-0 win over Campbell Jr. College last Friday at Richardson Field. The JVs were handicapped considerably, in that they had only 17 men, but Coach Mac Irwin said, “these 17 played like iron men throughout the entire contest.” Campbell had a very good running attack as several times they threatened to score, picking up considerable yardage on end-around and off-tackle plays. A pass from Guiton, who played a bang-up game at tailback for the JVs, to Jimmy Sloan, set up the first touchdown for the home team. Jim Rogers took the ball over to score. The second score came after a drive downfield, sparked by Guiton and Sloan. Rogers took the ball over for the second score of the game. In the line, John Smoot, who played 60 minutes, and Antos Camp, who played half the game, were outstanding. The JV team turned in a fine performance in its opening game, and if they continue to show the power they displayed against Campbell, they will be a team to watch.

...the perfect system is government control, complete and irrevocable, then we are rapidly approaching it. If the perfect system is one in which people have no freedom to decide for themselves, then the day of millennium is drawing ever closer. If the perfect system is one in which the government sees fit to dole out to the individual, who is much like a hog that is dependent on its owner to throw him the daily portion of slop, then the time is coming when perfection will be a reality. Morally, man will be little better than a hog in that all his natural creative instincts will have been purged by the uselessness of such efforts. Economically, the vast enterprises which were one expression of man’s creative impulse will be dead institutions, whose directors will care nothing for progress, existing under the government’s supervision and producing goods of a quality far below that of today. This then, is the perfect government which the five measures we have discussed will produce. Perfection? There will be no responsible choice and is the most undesirable way of giving mankind a freedom. “Freedom to,” on the other hand, implies that it is within the power of the individual himself to achieve freedom from fear, or hunger, or whatever. The individual is free to free himself, not to take the dole of some force to which he sustains the relationship of chattel and slave. Directly linked with this freedom to free oneself is the principle of free choice — “freedom to” followed by responsibility to stand behind that choice. "Freedom to" is infinitely greater than “freedom from,” for it allows the fullest growth and expansion of the human spirit.

Once this redistribution through taxation is accomplished, the government will automatically relinquish these powers. This sounds reasonable and desirable. It is a fair statement of what the administration has told us or implied to us for years. Shall we identify what the above statement connotes? Shall we name the system from which it differs by only a hair? The above statement is a basic reproduction of the principles of Marxism! It has differed in its execution only in the methods which have been used and are being used to achieve it. It is evident from this that we have been heading down the road to socialism for sixteen years. There can be no equivocation on this point. We have only

AMONG THE GREEKS... (Continued From Page Three)

Lacy, Huffaker, and Denison went back up to W. C. with Cameron and Mary B. It is said they all had a fine time. Rogers was in Raleigh as usual. I nearly forgot two of the more thoughtful brothers — Loftin and Cumming, who spent all Saturday afternoon in their room taking care of a sick friend. I wonder who he could be? About the only people I can’t account for are our pledges. We must have a motley crew; none of them were on the road this weekend. Something must be wrong.

PHI DELTA THETA

The brothers and pledges of Phi Delta Theta and their dates had a party at Erwin Lodge last Saturday afternoon. The entertainment was furnished by pledge Fiddling Flesh Bright and brother Ansel Moses, the Tennessee nightingale. In their classic renditions of mountain ballads, they were accompanied by Sloppy Lips Hooper on the jug. The ukulele twins, Whit Cobb and Al Cook, sang and played (?) “Those Wedding Bells Are Ringing in the Chapel” in honor of the budding romances of Wes Pritchard, Ansley Moses, and Bob Wearn, and their respective dates. Bobbie Jones of Queen’s College sang “Night and Day” and “Smoke Gets in My Eyes,” while her date, Buddy Spiney, smiled like a jack-rabbit eating briars. We don't blame you Buddy, she has a beautiful voice. In the middle of this entertainment, a scream was heard downstairs where pledge Al Miller was learning that L-A-D-I-E-S doesn't spell men. This event brings back memories of last year when brothers Hartley Hall and Al Guthrie decided “to play some golf” one night. I bet Slim Tate remembers that!

Lonely ladies adorned the Phi Delt fraternity house and boarding house all weekend. Halfman Strand, when asked about sweet Pat, said, “I've got the true double A bomb hots.” Halfman’s actions proved it when he said goodnight or rather good morning to Pat, according to Bill Klemm. But what I'd like to know is what Bill was doing in the swing on the front porch at that time of night. If we knew the answers, we would also... It is a shame that Jim Campbell couldn’t find a ride over to Queens Sunday night. If he had, perhaps half-woman would be dating him instead of the spherical one this coming Friday night. Phi Delta Theta is proud of its two newest pledges, Dick Thorpe and Bill Mivens, who pledged last week.

BETA THETA PI

Once again, as the student body begins to settle down to the old grind, Phi Alpha’s sons of Wooglin get straightened out after a hectic opening week and begin to organize and swing into action. Two weeks ago, a contingent of six journeyed to West Point in Brother Francis Pepper's joy wagon. They spent one night at the home of Brother Tom Allen in Bethlehem, Penn., drove up to the game on Saturday, and then returned to N.Y.C. The only incident worthy of mention which reached our ears occurred when Brother Thad Munroe thoroughly doused the proprietor of a Gotham banana cart with the results of an indigestible hamburger. Last weekend, the house was overflowing with beautiful young ladies and the familiar faces of many alumni, including past president Al Scarborough, all of whom we were delighted to have. With the return of intramural athletics, Beta Theta Pi fields one of the strongest teams which she has had in several seasons. With guards and ends five deep and three good centers, a fast backfield of experienced blockers should go a long way. Beta’s initial victory over the Campus Club is not an accurate indication of things to come, because neither team was polished to any degree; however, before too many days, we hope to be in top-notch shape. Brother Murray Ashman is doing a fine job in his capacity as athletic manager. Congratulations are in order for both Phi Alpha and two new brothers: Tommy Cranford and Roy Davis. These two fellows, pledged early this year, have just completed their respective informal and formal initiations and have been welcomed into the brotherhood of Beta Theta Pi. With plans pending for Homecoming, and pledges and brothers taking an active part in student affairs, Phi Alpha redoubles her effort to live up to the tradition set by Davidson fraternities and feels that Wooglin’s smile is broader than ever.

By BILL WHITE

Startled by two first-quarter touchdowns by their fleet foe and beset with fumbles from the start, Davidson’s favored Wildcats came apart at the seams and bowed to Presbyterian’s sharp Blue Hose in an upset 27-7 home debut last Saturday night. Coach Lonnie McMillian’s Blue Hose had more than a few runs under Richardson Field’s somewhat inadequate arches, but on them, it was becoming. With a host of trackmen in their backfield, the Presbyterians from South Carolina far outshone their denominational brethren from upper Mecklenburg, their speedy carriers more than offsetting the brilliant passing of Auburn Lambeth, who was getting very little protection from an out-rushed line. It may be explained by the fact that Davidson came through the Army opener injury-free and was feeling a bit like this would be a breather after the tough one before Buckling State. Then, too, the P.C. crew had been humbled by Clemson, 69-7, a fact that probably led the Wildcats to lightly regard them. But there the Cats misfigured. The Hose had had a free week in there and were ready to bounce back. They did.

George Fleming picked up a P.C. fumble on the Davidson 12 and raced around right end for the first Hose score, and before the quarter was out, Blake Watts, a real sprinter if there is one, took a handoff from Bill Jolly, 26 yards out, and went the distance, Fred Barnum annexing the point. Davidson came back on Auburn's arm, a 46-yard run by Jimmy Sifford, a Lambeth-Mott Price aerial, and a five-yard sweep by Sifford. Hal Mapes added the point, and it looked as if the Cats were on their way back. Presbyterian completely took the wind out of the Davidson sails a few moments later, however, when they climaxed a long Blue Hose drive by crashing over from the two. The Hose tallied their final score in the third quarter on a 31-yard pass from Jolly to Hollis Kate. Jimmy Sifford was the Wildcats' top ground gainer, clipping off 121 yards for his night’s work. Davidson outgained the Presbyterians, 14-9, in first downs, but the difference was in blocking and tackling. The Cats looked flat, while Presbyterian seemingly couldn’t miss with a block or tackle.
