Failed two-point conversions doom Davidson gridiron comeback in VMI game  
By GIGGY MAXWELL  

The final score was VMI 39, Davidson 36. But it shouldn’t have been that close. Had the Wildcats been able to do what Head Coach Vic Gatto told them they needed to do to win the game, Davidson would have handed VMI a rather solid defeat. At the end of last Tuesday’s practice, Gatto told his team that VMI was a ballclub that had had lots of difficulty hanging on to the ball. They were going to turn the ball over several times on Saturday and it was the ‘Cats job to not only capitalize on those turnovers but make sure that they stayed in the game by not committing turnovers of their own.

Gatto was right. The VMI Keydets coughed up the ball five times, four times on fumbles and once on an interception. The only problem was that Davidson gave the ball back to VMI three times on fumbles of their own. One Wildcat fumble, in the second quarter, occurred on the play immediately following a VMI fumble.

Turnovers were not the only thing that led to Davidson's 28-7 halftime deficit. Their special teams gave up several big plays, including an 87-yard punt return for a score, and a 57-yard kickoff return. VMI's average starting field position in the first half was the Davidson 45, Davidson’s was their own 27. Davidson’s lone first half score was recorded on a Peter Hughes to Jebo Barnes pass that covered seven yards and capped a nine-play 79-yard drive.

To their credit, the Wildcats didn’t fold when they came out for the second half. They knew they were better than the Keydets, and they were going to prove it. On their second possession of the second half, the Wildcats marched 85 yards in eight plays behind the running of Ralph Isernia (56 yards on the drive including the four-yard score) and Peter Hughes (20 yards on a QB draw).

Gatto elected to fake the extra point and go for the two-point conversion. Matt Matheney’s pass was intercepted at the five and returned 95 yards for a safety. The Wildcats now faced a 30-13 deficit instead of the 28-14 one that the extra point would have given them, a three-point turn-around.

The end of the third quarter saw the Wildcats drive to the VMI 15 where the drive stalled. Freshman kicker James Brown opened the fourth quarter by booting his eighth field goal of the season, one shy of the Wildcat record. On VMI's ensuing series, their quarterback fumbled the ball away to Davidson at the VMI 20-yard line. The Wildcats once again squandered a golden opportunity as they fumbled the ball back on the very next play. The Keydets then drove the ball 81 yards for a score to increase their lead to 37-16.

With 12:50 remaining, Davidson began its frantic comeback. The ‘Cats took 10 plays and 4:10 to go 66 yards as Ralph Isernia picked up his second score of the day. The two-point conversion attempt failed. VMI 37, Davidson 22. At the 7:12 mark, Davidson recovered another VMI fumble, this time at the Keydet 29. Four plays later, Hughes found Isernia for his third score of the afternoon. This time the two-point conversion was good. VMI 37, Davidson 30.

With 2:20 left on the clock, VMI faced a third and six at midfield. DB Mike Carney, coming hard on a blitz, hit the backfield so fast that he intercepted an attempted pitch to a Keydet tailback, rambling 37 yards before being tripped up on the VMI five-yard line. Three plays and one QB sack later, Davidson faced fourth and goal from the Keydet 10. Peter Hughes found Mike Carney in the end zone.and the Wildcats now only trailed by one, 37-36, with the two-point conversion still to come. The play was supposed to be a pitch left to Isernia with the left guard pulling to lead the way into the end zone for a 38-36 Wildcat victory. Unfortunately, the pulling guard didn’t, and the pitch went astray. Isernia picked up the loose ball and shuttle-passed it toward the end zone where it was picked off by a VMI defender and returned 90 yards for the second safety of the day, an NCAA first. VMI 39, Davidson 36. What if Davidson hadn’t tried a single two-point conversion and been successful on all its PAT attempts? Wildcats 38, VMI 35. But that’s something for people to argue about in the offseason. Right now the Wildcats are preparing for their final contest of the season against Salisbury State, which will take place in front of a Homecoming crowd at Richardson Field. Make sure you come out and give the 1989 Wildcat football team, in particular the graduating seniors, the sendoff it deserves.

three women’s tennis scholarships. “We've now lost 6-3 and 7-2, and I wouldn't be surprised if it is 8-1 this year,” she said. Better players attracted by scholarships also allow a team to schedule more nationally prominent opponents, and that leads to invitations to high-profile tournaments, Price added. Although coaches may not want to face the choice of assigning scholarships to certain players over others, she would personally welcome the challenge. The fact that this year’s seniors in high school will be making college decisions impels some quick action at Davidson. Martin said the college wants to move quickly on the issue, and that there is authorization to grant up to three more scholarships for the next academic year. However, it’s not definite that will happen. The unsettled nature of conference affiliation, the arrival of Terry Holland as athletics director next May, and the imminence of students’ college decisions are all arguments for an approach that doesn’t commit Davidson to long-term action this year. Caroline Brown, for one, urged a cautious approach. “We need to sit down as a college and discuss all our options,” she said.
