THE WOODROW WILSON TREE

About two months ago there came to Davidson a letter addressed “To Some Photographer.” It was from an American writer, requesting at once a picture of the tree which Woodrow Wilson put out when a student at Davidson. The letter was given to W. A. Johnson, who at once started out to locate the tree. Inquiry was made among the senior members of the faculty and then the older residents of the town, but to no avail, and then letters were sent to all of Wilson’s classmates and other men who were in college at that time, as far as their addresses could be secured. A reply was received from nearly all the men and while they were unanimous in saying that Wilson planted a tree here, none of them seemed to know the exact spot. His classmates say that the President took a prominent part in the customary tree planting in the spring of 1874. Ex-Governor Glenn, of North Carolina, a classmate of Wilson's, planted his tree near the church, on the walk from Chambers, and is of the opinion that Woodrow Wilson put his tree on the same walk but twenty or thirty steps nearer the main building. A photograph has been taken of this row of elms and sent to the writer of “The Famous Trees of America,” who has withheld the book from the press for six weeks, so that the Wilson tree might occupy an important place in this publication.
