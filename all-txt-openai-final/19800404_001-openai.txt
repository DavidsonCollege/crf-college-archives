**Patterson Court future appears stable; Slater still more expensive**  
By JIM REESE

The recent minimum wage increase and the rise in food and fuel costs will most likely force board fee hikes for the Patterson Court houses this fall term. However, spokesmen for the houses do not agree with predictions that it could become economically unfeasible to operate small-group eating houses in a number of years. Such predictions are part of the reason the new Dining Commons was designed to be large enough to feed 1600 to 1800 students (see article on Commons).

Vice President for Development Duane Dittman said, “Should it become too difficult to operate the Patterson Court houses, the Commons would be able to accommodate the entire student body.” Dittman emphasized, however, that the eating house system is not threatened by the Commons and the administration will do all it can to preserve the (eating house) tradition.

Rusk House treasurer Betsy Thomas said the economic crunch for Rusk is “just now beginning.” Several other houses, however, had to increase their board fee for spring term, and many budget cuts have already taken place. “We have considered stopping Sunday night meals, and we've cut back on social functions,” said ETC treasurer Larry Jones. Members of Fanny and Mabel’s have been conserving energy because of high utility bills, according to treasurer Brian Kelleher.

None of the house spokesmen feel the possibility of phasing out Patterson Court is very likely, “at least not in the next three or four years,” Phi Delta Theta treasurer Ben McCall said. Rusk’s Thomas added, “Right now almost every house is less expensive than Slater,” and although the eating houses must raise their fees, “so will Slater.”

Several of the eating house treasurers (Trey Thies) also pointed out that since A.R.A. Slater food service is more expensive now than most eating houses, large group dining is not necessarily more economical. Director of Dining Services Barry Cheatham said the board fee for freshmen and independents eating at Bailey and Richards will increase next year. He also said that A.R.A. Slater expects to provide food service for the Commons, but board fees for the planned complex “will have to be worked out later.”

ATO treasurer Elizabeth Alexander does not expect each eating house’s board plan to vary too much from that of the Commons. “I think we'll survive,” she said.

Physical Plant Director Grover Meetze said Wednesday that while no contract has yet been signed, pre-construction meetings for the new Commons began this week. Meetze said these meetings are a result of several weeks of intense work and negotiation with the low bidder for the project, the L.P. Cox Construction Company. Negotiations have resulted in several changes in the overall plan of construction, Meetze said. “The tentative changes we have made...In the plans have been agreed to by the low bidder, so we are at liberty to get the wheels in motion. We really don’t want to lose any time.” Meetze expects construction to be completed by September 1981. Construction costs for the building are estimated at 3.2 million dollars, though the actual project cost, including such things as site preparations, relocating of power lines, and extension of facilities, will be about 3.6 million dollars. “The changes we have made in the plans do not substantially alter the operation of the building, but we have had to make some changes as (See Commons, page 11).

The advantage, however, is this committee can evaluate the program from an objective stance,” Shi said. “The danger is to expect too much. The committee will only be here for two days, and the information they evaluate will necessarily be general,” Shi said. They will be able to tell us if what we're doing is realistic from their perspective.

The College will hire a Director of Computer Services for next year as part of a drive to improve Davidson's administrative and instructional computer system. The Computer Planning Committee made the recommendation to establish the new position. According to the committee’s report, the new Director will be a faculty member directly responsible to the Vice President for Academic Affairs. The Director will teach students to achieve “computer literacy,” promote computer use among members of the faculty in classroom instruction and research, and support the administrative staff in areas such as registration, finances, and student records. Particular emphasis will be placed on institutional research for use in “allocation of resources in the 1980s of students, faculty, and administrative staff of the quality we wish will require that Davidson offer computer services that are more than merely adequate,” the committee wrote, adding that the College should “seek to be a leader among liberal arts colleges in the field of computer services.”

Director of Personnel and Administrative Services Robert Stevenson, chairman of the Computer Planning Committee, said the Davidson educational experience should reflect the (See Computers, page 11).

The committee will spend Wednesday and Thursday of next week evaluating the program. Shi said the agenda would include meetings with the Athletic Advisory Committee, the Council on Intercollegiate Athletics, the Physical Education Committee, the Athletic Director, the Head Coaches, faculty, staff, and students. An evaluation of this sort is unprecedented, said College President Sam Spencer. A move is being made to evaluate other departments of the College in the future, Spencer said. Areas of the athletic program to be evaluated include Intramural Athletics, Women’s Athletics, levels of participation in regard to the aspirations of our program, and the College’s conference affiliation. Where conference affiliation is concerned, the committee will be told that the college is committed to a Division I program.
