2 Tuesday, December 13, 1988 THE DAVIDSONIAN

Text of the Report of the Faculty Committee on Intercollegiate Athletics

Introduction

Last spring the faculty charged us to report on (1) the costs of Davidson’s intercollegiate athletics program, (2) whether Davidson
should continue intercollegiate football, and (3) whether Davidson should continue competing in Division I. Our report focuses on financial and
academic costs, broken down into football, basketball, other men's sports, and women’s sports. We begin by describing our current situation.
We then examine five options before making recommendations.

The Current Situation

In 1987-88 the College spent $1.84 million on Division I intercollegiate athletics, of which 76% went to football and basketball.
Per player, we spent $13,200 in football, $38,700 in basketball, and $2,100 in other sports. Football players also received a
higher-than-average amount of need-based grants from the College: although they comprised 5% of the student body, they received $269,000 in
College grants, or 14% of the total need-based grants. The 1988-89 budget totals $1.86 million for intercollegiate athletics, of which
79% will go to football and basketball. College need-based grants to football players increased to $415,000, or 18% of the
total need-based grants. This year the average football player received a total need-based aid package amounting to 63% of tuition,
room, and board; the average non-football player, 16%.

We also pay high academic costs for football and basketball. Although our Division I programs attract the occasional brilliant athlete,
average SAT scores for incoming football players fall more than 100 points below the college average, while incoming basketball players’
scores fall more than 200 points below average. These low averages result largely from College policy for committee cases, especially
in football. [Footnote: Our admissions committee ranks applicants on a 1-10 scale. Normally admitted students receive ratings 7-10; wait-listed students
usually receive ratings 6-7. The number of recruited football admissions has varied from a high of 40 (three years ago)
to this year's more traditional number of 30. We usually allocate these recruited admissions evenly so that we admit one
third who meet the normal admission standards as well as one third in the “wait list” range; the entire faculty
committee scrutinizes the one third who fall below a rating of 6. In practice, the faculty committee creates a pool
of admissible football men in the under-6 range and the football coaching staff designates which ones will be offered admission.
Because the faculty committee turns down some of football's most desirable recruits, the football staff feels the faculty controls the
process. The faculty, however, do not feel they control the process because they do not set the number of committee
cases to be admitted. Basketball recruits up to its scholarship limit (15 players across the four years), with no fixed
number in the committee-consideration range. All other sports are limited to one committee case per year, and those are not
always used.]

Performance at Davidson matches these low incoming standards. The average class rank at graduation for football players is the 31st
percentile; for basketball players, the 33rd percentile; for other male athletes, the 39th percentile. Female athletes exceed the college average,
having an average rank at graduation in the 54th percentile.

Several other disturbing points deserve mention. In the past 11 years, football players have committed 27% of the honor code
violations despite comprising only about 5% of the student body. [Footnote: According to data supplied by Dean Terry, students committed
84 violations between fall 1977 and spring 1988. Athletes committed violations as follows: baseball 7, basketball 5, football 23, and
soccer 3.] Football and basketball players withdraw from Davidson at significantly higher rates than other athletes. Of committee case football
recruits since 1983, nearly one in four has dropped out of school.

On 22 March 1988, over President Reagan’s veto, Congress passed the Civil Rights Restoration Act, which requires institutions receiving federal
aid to spend equitably for men’s and women’s programs. In the past six months, litigants have filed 16 complaints against
12 institutions (Chronicle of Higher Education 2 November 1988). Our current 9.4/1 ratio of expenditures for men’s/women’s sports, therefore, exposes
us to a possible lawsuit unless we institute a plan to come into compliance within (probably) three years. This threat,
we hope, will compel us to do what we ought to do anyway: Treat all students fairly.

College legal counsel has not yet completely analyzed Title IX’s impact. Some leeway exists. For instance, dollar amounts spent per
player for equipment costs need not be equivalent since some sports require more expensive equipment. In our opinion, however, these
adjustments will not change our problem significantly. The minimum defensible ratio is ~4.1, about 70/30, the current participant ratio. Even
at 70/30 we would be vulnerable to the charge that we have not provided equal opportunities for female students, since
our enrollment is 60/40. Given the recent change in admissions policy, we can anticipate a 54/46 student body ratio in
next year’s incoming class. Responsible planning ought to aim for a 54/46 ratio of expenditures.

Planning must also take into account the new athletic complex. The athletics department anticipates hiring three new full-time staff members
to manage the swimming pool and coach swimming teams. Since the projected $3 million has been raised, those costs will
also appear in the annual budget. The new facility will require more heat, water, electricity, and maintenance than Johnston Gym.
The athletics department estimates that these aquatic and facility_ Average Percentage _ case expenses will total about Non-White 7% 7%
$340,000 annually. Communities & Possible Options: Below we list advantages and disadvantages for five possible combinations of Division I and
Division III teams. Division I is the highest competitive Need-Based Financial Aid:

1988-89: $14,652 "need-based aid."
Wildcat Club Donations: 1987-88: $159,661
1988-89: $204,808

Option #1: Remain in Division I for all sports. If funding for men's sports remains the same, we must add
$1.26 million annually to women's budgets to reach the 54/46 ratio, and $540,000 to reach even the minimum 70/30 ratio.
The $340,000 for the new athletic complex must be added to these figures, for totals of $1.6 million and $880,000
required to achieve the respective 54/46 and 70/30 ratios.

Advantages include:
- Maintaining the Division I sports program that has made us distinctive among liberal arts colleges "most selective" and "highly
selective" in admissions.
- Continued media coverage for our athletic teams at the present rate.

Disadvantages include:
- Difficulty in finding even $880,000 to add to the athletics budget. [Footnote: In 1987-88 the Wildcat Club raised $245,000
of the $272,000 it pledged.]
- Uncertainty of long-term prospects for success in Division I given our small and, for men, decreasing size.
- Adding athletic scholarships to football and/or other men's sports would multiply our difficulties regarding Title IX.

Option #2: Play Division III football and leave other sports in Division I. We would save about $480,000; we would
need to add $840,000 to women's sports to reach the 54/46 ratio, and $340,000 to reach even the 70/30 ratio.
The $340,000 for the new athletic complex must be added to these figures. Taking into account the $480,000 savings, an
extra $700,000 and $190,000 would still be needed to achieve the respective 54/46 and 70/30 ratios [Footnote: Discrepancies in several
computations result from correcting for rounding errors.]

Advantages include:
- Continuing to provide an educational experience in football, at a level appropriate to an institution of our size and
academic standards.

Disadvantages include:
- Difficulty in finding even $190,000 to add to the athletics budget.
- We would not be able to afford swimming teams, and would probably have to reallocate money from basketball to
women's sports as well to achieve equity.
- Difficulty in scheduling football, since Division III schools feel some reluctance to play Division III teams housed at Division
I schools.
- Possibility that the NCAA will rule out this option by creating a level of "AAA" so that true Division
III schools will not have to compete in football against schools that play Division I in other sports.
- Uncertainty of prospects for football success in Division III, since we would not attract our current caliber of athlete.

Option #3: Play all sports in Division III. We would save at least $750,000 (further savings would come from basketball).
We would need to add $620,000 to women's sports to reach the 54/46 ratio and $220,000 to reach the 70/30
ratio. The $340,000 for the new athletic complex must be added to these figures. Taking into account the $750,000 savings,
an extra $200,000 would be needed to achieve the 54/46 ratio, while the 70/30 ratio would be met with $190,000
to spare.

Advantages include:
- Competing at a level appropriate to an institution of our size and academic standards.
- Achieving at least a 60/40 ratio in men's/women's expenditures and paying for the new athletic complex without increasing the
athletics budget.

Disadvantages include:
- Losing the Division I sports program that has made us distinctive among "most selective" and "highly selective" liberal arts
colleges.
- Reduced media coverage for our athletic teams.
- Difficulty in scheduling games since Division III schools in our region do not compete in football.

Option #4: Drop football and remain in Division I. We would save almost $800,000. To achieve a 54/46 ratio we
would need to add $580,000 to women's sports; a 70/30 ratio, $200,000. The $340,000 for the new athletic complex must
be added to these figures. Taking into account the $800,000 savings, an extra $120,000 would still be needed to achieve
the 54/46 ratio, while the 70/30 ratio would be met with $250,000 to spare.

Advantages include:
- Achieving at least a 60/40 ratio in men's/women's expenditures and paying for the new athletic complex without increasing the
athletics budget.
