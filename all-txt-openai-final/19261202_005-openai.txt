**Three Wildcat Players Given Places on Composite All-Star North Carolina Eleven**

**Davidson Alumnus Delivers Address**

Mr. H. S. Richardson, '06, of Greensboro, one of the donors of Richardson Field and Richardson Stadium, is becoming widely
known as a speaker upon taxation and its relationship to business and manufacturing in North Carolina. He will speak at
Wilmington Thursday night, and an effort is being made to have him remain over for the banquet meeting of the
Wilmington Alumni Association, which the secretary is to organize Friday night.

The Wilmington Star of Sunday, November 28th, has the following to say in regard to Mr. Richardson’s appearance in that
city:

“H. S. Richardson, of the Vick Chemical Company, Greensboro, will deliver an address on taxation and its relations to business
and manufacturing in the state, at a dinner meeting of the Wilmington Real Estate board to be held Thursday night
at 7:00 o'clock, at the Cape Fear Hotel.

“Mr. Richardson, who is regarded as an authority on taxation, having made a careful study of the subject in North
Carolina, is an interesting speaker and a man who is closely identified with the real estate business of the state.

“He will deliver the same address here that was so effectively delivered by himself at the recent state convention of
the North Carolina Real Estate board in Charlotte. The realty men then were greatly impressed with the address, believing it
to be the base of a question so vital to the best interests of the state.

“City and county officials and the president and secretary of the chamber of commerce have been invited to attend.”

Wrangling Captain Lucien Wells.
It was the Wildcat’s first victory over a member of the “Big Five” for the year. Davidson’s Championship (Continued from
page 1) out game marked by unnecessary and bickering. Final score, Davidson 3, P. C. 0. Dick Grey did the
work. The first team took a rest the next week while the second team piled up a 23-point lead over
the Guilford Quakers. Dick Grey again came into the limelight the following week by scoring the vital three points over
State College. The game was replete with thrills, the Davidson attack being featured by the long end runs of Captain
Lucien Wells. The Wolfpack threatened twice but each time their offense was crushed as they neared the Davidson goal. The
Demon Deacons of Wake Forest journeyed to Charlotte to battle the ’Cats to a tie score for the second successive
year. Again Dick Grey sent over a field goal, only to have it matched by Captain Rackley, of the Deacons.
Neither team showed the power which had marked their attacks during preceding games. The V. M. I. Cadets were met
at Lynchburg. The Wildcats pushed over a tally early by a diversified aerial attack but the Flying Squadron came back
strong to score twice in the second quarter and take the game 12-7. The last half found the Carolinians fighting
desperately for another score but unsuccessfully. The Hampden-Sydney Tigers came to Wearn field to clear up a 6-6 tie of
the preceding season and after the smoke of battle had cleared they marched off the field with the long end
of a 13-0 score. Davidson failed to show the offensive strength of previous games and their hitherto well-balanced passing attack
was completely smothered. Carolina came to Davidson to help the Cats celebrate Home-coming Day. The Davidson team pushed over a
touchdown in the first few moments and Dick Grey booted a field goal later in the game. The Tar Heels
ripped and snorted in a creditable manner but failed to score. Durham was the scene of the final fray of
the season. Duke held the Wildcats during the first half, but the home team came back strong in the second
to score 20 points and thereby clinch the state title. Grey, Nesbit and Mitchell were luminaries.

For warmer days I'm hankering
Cried handsome Leo Pritchett,
You see I own an overcoat
But I can't wear the ticket.

The Architect's Annual Convention met at its usual time. After opening the meeting with prayer the entire audience rose and
sang, “How Firm a Foundation.”

Judge—“What’s wrong with this sentence? ‘Ten years at hard labor.’”
Convicted—“Your honor, it’s too long.”

Our idea of a one horse town is one where they paint “Come Again” back of the welcome sign.

The laboratories and shops of industry are the sources of many of the enduring attainments of our times. In the
General Electric organization is an army of 75,000 persons, co-operating to make electricity do more and better work for humanity.

Man-power
Four millions of the best man-power of Europe perished in the Napoleonic conquests. Military conquest is non-creative, while industry is
always creative. In the last ten years one American manufacturer—the General Electric Company—has created machines having a man-power forty times
as great as that of all the lives lost in the Napoleonic wars. In the years to come, when the
college men and women of today are at the helm of industry and of the home, it will be realized
more and more that human energy is too valuable to be wasted where electricity can do the work better at
lower cost.
