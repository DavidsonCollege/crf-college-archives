DON’T take a fellow’s pipe. Take some other possession. Because wrapped up in his pipe is a fellow’s peace of
mind, his relaxation, his contentment. This is more than true if it’s a WDC Pipe, because then a good smoke
is multiplied many times over. Our special seasoning process takes care of this by bringing out all the sweetness and
mellowness of the genuine French briar. Just you go to any good dealer and select several good shapes. Put them
in your rack. Smoke a cool one every time, and you'll be well on your way to pipe-happiness.

It seems that C. K. Brown, in making his getaway from Chapel, cut loose at the head of M. Tremain,
the piano hammerer, with a hymn book. Not pausing to be thankful that he was not smitten with a rock,
the angered sound extractor aroused himself from his dreams of—the patron saint of music, whoever he is—and put forth in
pursuit, thirsting for revenge. Since the product of the number of steps per minute and the length of each step
taken by the Mad Musician was greater than the same product produced by the pursued, Brown, C. K. was overhauled
and boarded at White's Druggery—a very appropriate place in view of the prospective bloodiness.of the combat. The struggle lasted about
3 16-18 seconds. Neither side claims the victory; in fact, there appears to be none to be claimed. “Chile to
lay concrete roads.”—The Fech. Davidson Aldermen, please note above and also the condition of Main Street. We wonder if there
would be any objection to the student body taking up a collection to put a bridge over the ditch on
the hither tennis court.

"Base Villain, why torturist thou me so?" asked one hero as he was being divided by his enemies. "That stormy
night when first I saw you enter the lonely cabin on the mountainside, I swore I would have vengeance for
your theft of my plug of chewing tobacco," was the reply.

Rain, rain, come pouring down, Nothing but dust is over the ground; The flowers are thirsty and dying, too, And
no one knows just what to do, But really I want to indulge in the sport of tennis and court.

Our well-known merchant and gasoline seller, Colonel Elliott, barely escaped an irreparable loss last week. One of his patrons purchased
a package of cigarettes and two boxes of matches and tendered the genial storekeeper 50 cents in payment. Mr. Elliott
promptly handed him 87 cents change and well-nigh fainted when he discovered his mistake.

For the benefit of those who "are forever blowing bubbles," and consider that they are singing a new one, we
would like to say that a number of last year's "Harvard Lampoon" has some comment on the song.

Now there is a boy named Spring Diddle, Who lives in a town not far away, And when he had
finished at high school His dear father then sent him down— Down here to learn of the game of life.
So Spring Diddle drifted around,

ORDERS SOLICITED

When he came into the station one day, He and a hundred more, He told the boys how he would
run things. I am not saying where he was sore. He ran things—AT THE COMMISSARY 16 Chambers. When they finished
his legs, And when he was running he swore.

But swearing is poor satisfaction, they say, So Spring Diddle tried a new plan Of keeping his mouth shut up
all the day And answering nary a man. But the faculty was not so strong for this And so with
the youth they raised sand.

Now Spring Diddle has learned a little. But still he has much to learn. He knows the declension of hora,
And just how a paddle will burn. He knows that he is called a Freshman; Just why he don't give
a dern.

It is with a heavy heart that we take our Waterman's in hand to chronicle the fact that there has
been a fight in our midst. This is very deplorable (the fight). Both scrappers refused to
