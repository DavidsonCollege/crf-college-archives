THE DAVIDSONIAN

ARTS & LIVING MONDAY, FEBRUARY 10, 1997

To the beat of the rhythm of the night

By Margaret Lumpkin

As I neared Johnston Gym last Friday evening, I could hear the beat of hundreds of drums before I set foot on the steps in front of the building. The very walls shook with a confused but irresistible beat that rattled my bones as I hurried inside. This was the drumming circle; the kick-off event to Solidarity Week, which runs through February 14.

Inside the already warm gym, a large crowd was gathered around a small central stage where Arthur Hull, a master drummer and leader of the circle (who bears a strong resemblance to Dr. Abbott in the English department), swung wide his arms in welcome at the swarming mass of late-comers. It truly was a community event; while there were more students than Davidson townspeople present, I saw young and old, black and white faces, all intent on their drums, their hands making the rafters shake above our heads. I hurriedly picked out a medium-sized barrel drum and made my way to the group.

Hull let us beat our drums silly for a while, guided by the deep bass of two master drummers seated on the stage, keeping the beat with larger instruments.

Then he led us through a series of rhythms, dividing us into groups and having us “answer” each other in turn.

The experience was exhilarating; first one half of the crowd would silence, with the other beating a powerful rhythm. Then, in full force, the other half would join back in, making us realize just how powerful we were as a combined group.

Hull, as the master of ceremonies, explained how each drum was a different voice; the frame drums, the barrel drums, the deeper bass drums, and all the other percussion instruments together created a unique symphony. The metaphor was obvious; each of us has a voice, and each contributes to the community — both the Davidson and the global community — in a vitally different way.

As we became more comfortable with our instruments and with the “global” rhythms running through our hands and bodies, our voices became more integrated into a symphony of sound. No longer was this the cacophony I had come upon, panting, running up the stairs at 7:35 p.m. This was real music.

I left that evening exhausted, with red painful hands (and a slight headache), but with a heart full of the rhythm and spirit of the global drum.
