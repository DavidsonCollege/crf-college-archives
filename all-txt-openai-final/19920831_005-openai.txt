Objectives
- To encourage a campus climate which does not tolerate alcohol abuse.
- To change the social expectations of the campus and develop a more creative, healthy, and social environment.
- To establish appropriate disciplinary mechanisms and penalties for those who violate this policy.

Regulations
- Alcoholic beverages may be consumed only in the following areas: Residence halls, Patterson Court, Vail Commons, Designated areas of the College Union.
- Service in other areas requires the prior approval of the Dean of Students.
- No student activities funds (defined as those funds collected by the college) may be used for the purchase of alcoholic beverages for service to persons under the legal drinking age.
- There shall be no alcohol consumed in any public areas of a residence hall.
- Freshman halls may not sponsor parties which include alcoholic beverages.
- Beer and unfortified wine are the only alcoholic substances permitted in or around Patterson Court houses for all open parties. Closed parties must be BYO, but may not include punches, jello, etc.
- On Patterson Court, no one leaving the designated service area (separate from the social function) may have more than one container of alcohol—the container not to exceed 16 ounces in capacity.
- No house may advertise a party with reference or inference to alcohol nor shall this advertising be demeaning to any group or individual.
- Each house is limited to two weekday “wet” parties per semester in its house.
- To encourage adherence to the laws of North Carolina regarding alcohol, all parties held on Patterson Court must employ party monitors trained by campus police and the Dean of Students Office. These monitors shall be responsible for maintaining the alcohol policy and the laws of the State. They shall report all persons who are in violation of this policy to the Alcohol Enforcement Committee through the Dean of Students Office.
- No pledge activities by Patterson Court houses may involve the use of alcohol. “Pledge activities” are defined in terms of activities sanctioned, organized, or paid for by the respective houses.

Evaluation
- The policy will be evaluated following the spring vacation of 1993 including: a statistical summary of alcohol-related disciplinary cases by the AEC submitted by the Dean of Students to the President, an evaluation by the Alcohol Counseling Center, the SHOC, and the Director of Residence Life.
- The SGA, the Union Board, and the Patterson Court Council will be invited to submit their evaluations concerning the effectiveness of this policy as it relates to general student life.

Monitor’s Duties
- Enforce the 16-ounce one cup rule and the Davidson College Alcohol Policy.
- Any person in the party is liable to have his/her ID checked by the monitor.
- Prohibit anyone under 21 from entering the party with his/her own alcohol.
- Monitors will note and eject from the party any student involved in any kind of abusive behavior.
- Monitors will offer any intoxicated person assistance such as getting him/her assistance to his/her room, helping in case of sickness, etc.
- Monitors will have access to campus police and should not hesitate to call for help.
- Monitors will record all violations they observe and report them to the AEC through the Dean of Students Office.

There will be a serious attempt to recruit responsible Davidson students to serve as monitors. Outside monitors will also be employed by the college in the event student monitors are not viable, and all monitors will be trained.by campus police and the Dean of Students office. Three monitors will be employed for each party unless otherwise specified by the Dean of Students Office. A monitor will be designated as head monitor. Monitors will wear apparel which will identify them. Monitors will be trained to perform their duties in a courteous manner. They will be equipped with walkie-talkies to communicate with campus police.

Richard Pizzo. The house may become a permanent feature of the court. For now, “the whole thing is experimental,” says Union Director William Brown. “We’re not sure what hours will be most in demand. We’ve tried to create a flexible space. This area is wide open for programming and food service.” Brown, Pritchard, and Terry emphasize that all students are welcome at the new facility.

“Organizational Meeting — September 2nd: 7:30 PM Morrison Room.”

Important Notice of New Honor Code Stipulations
As this year begins, I want to bring to your attention two important notices regarding the Honor Code.

The first point is to serve as a reminder of a statement made at the end of last year in a letter in The Davidsonian:
-Taking food from the kitchen or from a refrigerator outside the kitchen of a Patterson Court house of which one is not a member will therefore be considered a violation of the Honor Code.

The second notice was recently issued by the Honor Council and Dean Terry when it was brought to their attention that some students are using fake Davidson College IDs off campus:
-Use of any fake Davidson College ID (one with which someone has tampered or that of another student or former student) on or off campus is false and improper use of an official college document and will therefore be considered a violation of the Honor Code.

From this point forward, these notices are officially in effect. Please pay careful attention to each.

receiving them from their advisors. Freshmen met their advisors early Friday afternoon and Drop/Add began at four the same day. Dean Terry agreed that the freshman course selection was of concern. Students, both old and new, agreed on the importance and thoroughness of Orientation. Schleafer enjoyed how Orientation “eased you into [Davidson life],” even if specific panels and lectures appeared tedious. Hall counselors Rachel Dunifon and Julie Petty recalled the long weekend as “hectic,” but felt a balance was attained between education and fun. Freshman Advisor David Wang attributed the positive outcome not only to outstanding organization by school officials, but to the energetic attitude of the Freshman class. According to most people who have worked with the freshmen over the past week, the class of 1996 is an eager bunch, ready to enjoy Davidson.
