Question of The Week

“What do you think of our present student government set-up, and what changes, if any, would you suggest in our
constitution?”

Dan Hodges, Senior: “The Student Government functions better than that of larger colleges in North Carolina because it is closer
to the students. In a large school, the honor system would prove less effective because it would be much harder
to enforce it on a group of several thousand students; likewise, the power of the Court of Control would be
weakened considerably if its jurisdiction extended over eight hundred freshmen. The question has been raised: is our present Student Government
constitution outmoded? Is it a relic of the Davidson dark ages, or is it keeping up with the life of
the college? It allows for a faculty-student conference committee which has shown itself beneficial in the past. It includes a
sensible point system which limits the offices a student can hold. It provides for an election board which has proved
to be a help to both fraternity and non-fraternity men.

“If the Davidson student will make himself familiar with the Articles of our constitution, he will see that there is
seldom any objection to the constitution itself. What criticism is heard on the campus applies usually to existing rules, faculty
rulings, and not to the constitution of the student government. I believe that through the faculty-student committee, ‘wrongs’ will be
righted—or, at least, brought to a compromise.”

Jim Owens, Senior: “I think the present organization of the student council, student constitution, and set-up is very good. I
believe the change in chapel programs will prove to be a definite step forward. I would like to see a
better system for handling announcements devised than just by the bulletin board. So many students fail to read the announcements
because they forget to go by the board or just don’t try to push through the crowd there at chapel
time. The two chapel periods a week given to the student body can be used to good advantage. Many phases
of student life can be emphasized in these meetings which otherwise would receive little attention.

“During the election of the publication heads, I feel that the student body should be informed as to the qualifications
of the men eligible for election. The students don’t always know who has been active and who hasn't.”

Arch Taylor, Senior: “As far as the general organization of the Davidson College Student Government is concerned, I am well
satisfied with it. In theory, I believe it is as good as can be found anywhere, and in practice, I
would consider it above average.

“The principal fault I would find with the whole set-up is the fact that the individual students do not seem
to take as much interest in it as they should. During the recent election of a President for the Junior
class, the number of voters was never as much as half the class, although this officer was to be considered
the head and the leader for the whole class.

“This gross indifference is to be deplored, and I hope that by use of the new chapel program set-up, by
which means the true functions of student government officers may be better presented to the students, a greater interest can
be engendered. One who feels that he has taken some actual part in the election of those who govern him
will feel a greater compulsion to follow and to take an active interest.”

Ivey Steward, Junior: “The student government at Davidson is, of course, based on the honor and integrity of each member
of the student body. Upon this assumption, our present set-up seems the best possible one that could be worked out.
Every violator is given every possible chance to clear himself—and if he is so unfortunate as to commit a violation
knowingly, then he can blame only himself.”

HOMECOMING DECORATION WINNERS

Interior Of Chambers Auditorium Renovated Drapes, Carpets, and a Library Pulpit are Latest Additions

Smoking Room to be Located In Basement

By HERB MORTON

In order to prevent bewildered freshmen from getting lost, a description of the building is given below. The southern end
of the basement has been renovated to contain the current newspaper room, a new magazine room, and a rare volumes
section. The center of the basement has been changed to house the library's catalogues and books on Marshal Ney.

With an array of guillotines, turkeys, and turkey soup, the Pikes capitalized on the V. P. I. turkey to win
first place in the Homecoming Decorations Contest. Stopping to “gas” with the Betas, the judges saw fit to give them
second place for their unique service station decoration. Ensnared by the art of some Fiji, the same judges awarded third
place to the Spider Web and Spider which filled out the caption over the Phi Gamma Delta House, “Won't you
Come Into Our Parlor?” Other decorations for Homecoming ranged from football fields to barnyards.

FIJI FORM “SECTION”

Saturday afternoon found a large portion of the Phi Gam chapter already in Charlotte awaiting with anticipation the Davidson-Furman football
clash. As the time for the kick-off drew near, the brothers gathered at the stadium and formed a regular Fiji
section. After doing their best toward boosting the Wildcat spirit with their yells and singing, the Fiji band scattered and
celebrated another victory for Davidson.

Brother Fred Morton is still carrying on his research at Queens two or more nights a week—a Miss Judy Schoel
seems to be the guinea pig. Legerton is still wondering why all twelve of Raymond McDaniel’s old flames flushed him
for the last dance set. (Maybe it's the “TOUS” brand of “goose grease” you're using, Legs.)

Rehring was seen in the shadows of North Carolina, and by no means least, Teensy Hodges who made the trip
to correct an injustice. Pledge Bill Turner went home to Wilson, N. C., while pledges Jack Taylor and Joe Anderson
visited their homes in New Bern, N. C. A number of the Pikas were entertained by a feed at the
Steppe house Sunday night.

K. A.’s FEED

The Furman game, various weekend journeys, and a Sunday night feed were the highlights of the week for the K.
A.’s. Brothers Garrison, Efird, and Mebane managed to get down to Rock Hill for a short time before the game
Saturday night. The entire chapter was at the Furman game in Charlotte Saturday night. Brothers “B” Shaw and “Whizzer” White
were with the team. Brother Howell was near the camera, and other brothers and pledges were playing in the band.pof
