**Will’s world: Jekyll and Hyde**

By WILL BRADSHAW

Fifty-one seconds to play, down by three, Narcisse Ewodo steps to the line for three shots. A hush falls over
the crowd. Narcisse Ewodo. A senior on a team that has surpassed all expectations except their own. Could it have
been more perfect? He calmly drained all three, knotting the game at 76. And I stood up and screamed despite
the fact that I had no voice left after Saturday’s two games. I screamed because it was Ewodo’s number painted
on my chest in black and Prince Cisco scrawled across my back in red. I screamed because that’s all I
could do as a fan to help my team win, and now they needed me.

But that’s when the most amazing thing happened. I looked around and everyone was standing and screaming with me. Everyone.
And then I wondered, who took our regular fans and replaced them with this raucous, concentration-shaking bunch? Could this really
be a Davidson crowd? But it was. The Wildcats responded, too, stopping two Mountaineer attempts and pushing the ball into
the frontcourt to call timeout with 12 seconds to play. After the timeout, Ali Ton saw a lane to the
hoop and darted through it. But at the last moment, Josh Grover rotated back and tipped Ton’s shot into Ewodo’s
hands. He caught the ball... two seconds... gathered himself... one... was fouled by two Mountaineer players as he went up...
buzzer... and the ball dropped in. Bucket’s good. Wildcats win.

The crowd went wild. There was no holding back. No golf-clapping propriety or people looking at their companions and asking,
“What'd I miss?” Not here. People were high-fiving, hugging, jumping up and down and screaming with all their might. It
was beautiful, almost like I was someplace else. But I was sitting in Belk Arena with many of the same
people who have been here all year. Finally, we were true-to-life fans. My only regret is that we waited for
the nightcap to get so rowdy. Because the women could have used the same rabid bunch during their 67-66 afternoon
loss. But I’m not just pointing my finger at other people. My friends and I watched the final 30 minutes
of the game with a bag of body paint under our seats. We could have run into the men’s bathroom
and come out transformed into red and black superfans. But we didn’t. We all could have done a lot of
things to try and become the sixth person that might have helped change a loss into a win, and the
conference tournament fifth seed into the fourth. But we didn’t. Now the women must travel to Statesboro, Ga., and the
seniors will never play again in the not-so-interested confines of Belk Arena.

In the end, both Davidson teams might dance in March. If they do, hopefully the fans from Saturday night will
show, and the wine-and-cheesers in us all will stay home.

There is something about overtime and the women’s basketball team. Thursday night at Belk Arena, the Wildcats got past East
Tenn. St., 81-69, in their second OT game of the week. It was also their fourth in the last six
outings. The win avenged a 76-65 defeat to ETSU back in January, though it certainly didn’t come easy. The Wildcats
(15-9, 7-6) jumped out to a 13-point lead on ETSU (10-16, 3-11) but had that margin reduced to five by
the half. ETSU took their first lead with six minutes to go and found themselves down three points with just
over 20 seconds remaining. Hilary Edmonson then hit her fourth three-pointer of the game to tie the score. Davidson dominated
during the overtime period, outscoring the Bucs, 17-9. Kirsch and Jamie Brown scored six points apiece in the extra frame.
“The last six games have seemed like must wins,” added coach John Filar. Kirsch led the way with 25 points,
her third consecutive game with 20-plus points. Brown added 18 points and a career-high 15 rebounds.

A perfect ending to an extremely impressive career. For three years, Narcisse Ewodo has dazzled fans at Belk Arena, but
the 3,961 spectators that piled into Belk on Saturday were never more dazzled than when the senior, playing in his
last home game, hit a game-winning layup with less than one second remaining to give Davidson a 78-76 victory over
Appalachian St. (13-13, 8-6 SC) in both teams’ regular season finale. “What a victory for us and especially Narcisse,” said
coach Bob McKillop.“‘He put an absolute star on a wonderful career.” The victory capped an improbable ending for Ewodo and
the Wildcats. Despite leading virtually the whole way, Davidson found themselves down by three, 74-71, with just 1:38 remaining. “Quite
honestly, I thought we had the game won,” said App. St. coach Buzz Peterson. But Ewodo had other ideas. First,
he stole the ball from the Mountaineers’ Tyson Patterson and went the length of the floor before being fouled. He
buried both foul shots to cut the Mountaineer lead to one. Patterson responded with a jumper to put App. St.
back up by three. But in the ensuing Wildcat possession, Blair Adderly fouled Ewodo beyond the three-point arc. Ewodo calmly
buried all three free throws to tie the game. After a Mark Donnelly blocked shot, Davidson regained possession with 12
seconds remaining. Ali Ton penetrated, but his shot was blocked by Josh Grover. Ewodo collected the miss and shoved the
ball in with virtually no time left. “At first I thought Ali was going to pass,” said Ewodo. “But then
I looked up at him and his eyes were so wide open that I knew he was going to shoot.”
Ewodo scored the last seven points for Davidson, finishing with 16. He also grabbed nine rebounds. “This is just a
great feeling,” said Ewodo. “It’s just nice to be part of this basketball team.” Landry Kosmalski, who will likely collect
Southern Conference Freshman-of-the-Year honor this week, led the Wildcats with 20 points and nine rebounds. The Wildcats had to overcome
a 43-point performance from App. St.’s Junior Braswell. Braswell, in a dazzling shooting display, made 15-of-21 field goals. Ewodo putback
lifts Wildcats to win Senior scores final seven points to squelch Mountaineers’ rally “I told myself I was going to
come out shooting,” said Braswell. “I had no idea it was going to be like this...this is the hottest I
have ever been.” “Junior put on an NBA performance tonight,” said McKillop. “My hat is off to him.” But Braswell’s
dazzling performance proved not to be enough, as with the victory, the Wildcats clinched a tie with Marshall as the
Southern Conference North Division champions with a 10-4 league mark and 17-9 overall record. Because the Thundering Herd swept the
series with the Wildcats, Davidson will go into the conference tournament as the second seed in the north and face
The Citadel. “What a game this was to prepare for us for the tournament,” said McKillop. “What a delightful way
for us to end the season - as a team and for Narcisse.” (Anna Judy) Individual efforts highlight conference indoor
meet By Dalton McLean Staff Writer The men and women’s track teams traveled to East Tenn. St. this weekend to
compete in the Southern Conference Indoor Track Championships, the culmination of the season. Though the men’s team finished in seventh
place, coach Gary Andrew was pleased by the results. “It was one of the better efforts in the last two
years,” he said. Roland Williams had the most impressive run of the championships for the men, setting a new school
record of 22.99 seconds in the 200-meter. Two other Davidson 200 runners broke into the Davidson all-time top ten list
as well, Steve Hsieh with a time of 23.86 and Michael Albert (24.25). Two Wildcat relays also recorded top ten
times. The 4x400 relay of Ken Howard, Williams, Addam Marcotte, and Dan Dearing, grabbed a time of 3:33.57. While the
distance medley relay of David Slenzak (1200), Williams (400), Davey Bacon (800), and Keith Gordon (1600) made the top ten
list. Some personal bests recorded at the meet included Dearing with 53.55 in the 400, Howard with 2:01.82 in the
800, Gordon with 4:31.72 in the mile, and Thomas McElveen with 9:15.61 in the 3000. Overall, Andrew was happy with
Davidson’s effort. “Everyone can look at the meet and see that they’ve made progress. It is encouraging for the outdoor
season.” The women’s team also finished in 7th place in the championships, but a number of good runs were recorded.
Jamilah Sawyer set a new school hurdling record in prelims (8.53) and then broke it again in the finals (8.49)
on her way to a fifth-place finish in the meet. The distance medley relay of Suzy Burr (1200), Sawyer (400),
Janet Aardema (800), and Kate Feldmeier (1600) pulled out a sixth-place finish at the meet, one second off a new
Davidson record. See Track on page 16
