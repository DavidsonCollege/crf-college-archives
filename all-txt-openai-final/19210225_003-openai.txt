SHORT STORIES READ THE DAVIDSONIAN, FEBRUARY 25, 1921. VISITORS AT JUNIOR SPEAKING TO SEE “THE LOST SILK HAT” AND “THE
FLORIST SHOP”

MEETING OF SIGMA UPSILON

The Beetles met in the P. K. A. hall on Wednesday night, and the program was opened by a short
story composed and read by C. M. McCaskill. The central thought of his story was the devotion of a wife
to her husband. McCaskill was followed by A. L. Wilson, who read a story of college life as composed by
another student. The third number was a new serial, the first chapter of which was written by C. H. Long.
This chapter was read by J. M. Gaston. The setting was an Alabama mining town. This is the second serial
to be written by the “beetles” this year. Each number of the program was criticized, the good and bad points
in each selection being brought out.

Under the head of business, D. L. Mahood read a report of the actions of the first convention of the
State College Press Association. The invitation to meet with the Book Lovers Club of the town was accepted, so that
the next meeting will be held with the ladies in the Civic League Hall. Sigma Upsilon then stood adjourned, and
retired to the festivities.

Although just started this year, the Dramatic Club made a big hit among the Davidson students and friends of the
college. Under the able supervision of Prof. E. J. Erwin, assisted by F. N. Thompson, the president of the club,
a very creditable performance was staged last fall. It was discovered that there was some real talent among the students
for this kind of work. The play was a success from every standpoint to say the least. The club, feeling
very much encouraged over their initial performance and the generous support given them, decided to stage another play in the
spring. The club promises this second treat on the evening of March 5th, when it will present two short one-act
plays: The Lost Silk Hat, by Lord Dunsany; and one of the famous plays of the Harvard Dramatic Club, The
Florist Shop, by Winifred Hawkbridge. The casts are as follows:

The Lost Silk Hat:
The Caller—F. N. Thompson.
The Laborer—J. H. McKeithen.
The Clerk—H. K. Russell.
The Poet—J. M. Gaston.
The Policeman—W. J. Cooper.

Some good musical numbers will be given between the plays. The musical program will be announced later.

CENTER OF FINANCIAL INTEREST ON CAMPUS SHIFTS

Behold—the “commercial pendulum” has swung from Ponzi's establishment to the emissaries of the firm of D. J. Carpenter and Sons
(U. S. Salvage Corporation) now located at 5 Watts. The Sergeant Major, future Commander of the “Davidson Home Guard,” has
just returned from an extensive tour of the U. S. Salvage shops; bringing back new, and otherwise, samples of “yaller
breeches,” cavalry puttees, goat-skin raincoats, and many other scratch 'em garments. Weeks before their formal opening, the major, the silent
partner, ordered the sergeant major to have placed on all billboards within the immediate vicinity such significant posters as “skinny”
clothed with a barrel; showing the immediate need of the establishment’s line of goods. High prices, certainly not! Bargains, most
absolutely! Only Efird could afford to sell goods at fifty per cent of half price, minus freight charges, overhead expenses,
interest, discount, and war tax. This new establishment far overshadows Efird in his unique price cutting. Military tax is the
only profit made, but in the end this is contributed to the sinking fund of the MAJORITY of the R.

N.C. C. W. ELECTS STUDENT BODY OFFICERS; HERE SATURDAY NIGHT.

Marie Bonitz Chosen President—Music Seniors Enjoy Trip to New York.

(By N. C. Collegiate Press Service)At the regular mass meeting on February 9, 1921, officers of the Student Government Association
were elected for the year 1921-22. From the list of capable candidates for the presidency, Marie Bonitz was chosen because
of her competency, personality, democracy, and every other requisite for this office. Marie Bonitz has made an overwhelming success of
everything she has undertaken during her three years in college. She takes part, with interest, in every activity on the
campus—from athletics to Y. W. C. A. Enthusiasm kept up during the entire election. The other officers were voted on
with just as much care as was the president. The president-elect is fortunate in having such a splendid staff of
co-workers as the following: Vice-president, Branson Price; secretary, May Belle Penn; treasurer, Susie Roberts; fire chief, Kate Mitchell; cheer leader,
Dorothy Clement; chief marshal, Lila Ward Koonce.

The ten music seniors have returned to college from an enjoyable trip to New York, where they were chaperoned by
Professor and Mrs. Wade R. Brown. While there, they attended many famous operas, several concerts, and recitals. The remainder of
their time was entirely taken up with sightseeing, both in New York and Washington, where they stopped on their way
back to college.

PRELIMINARIES FOR INTER-COLLEGIATE DEBATES
(Continued from page 1)

Phi Society. The Phi Society held its preliminary for the inter-collegiate debating team last Friday night. The question for discussion
was, Resolved: That the United States should cancel the loans made to her Allies during the World War. The debate
was, as a whole, one which showed thorough preparation. The debaters seemed at ease on the floor and had plenty
of fight on the rebuttals, which were short and to the point. Those on the affirmative were: L. A. Taylor,
J. M. Dunlap, J. I. Knight, and C. G. Long. Those on the negative were: F. V. Long, H. A.
Hill, and J. F. Clark. The affirmative argued that the debts should be canceled, showing that the European countries were
economically and financially unable to pay the indemnities. The negative showed mainly that France and England were able to pay
their indemnities and that injustice would be shown to the American people if the loans were canceled. Each debater was
allowed ten minutes, which he might use as he desired. The judges, who were Drs. Sentelle and Shewmake, and Rev.
J. V. Hunter, chose C. G. Long, L. A. Taylor, J. M. Dunlap, and J. I. Knight as the four
debaters who shall meet the Eu’s with J. F. Clark as alternate.

LE CERCLE FRANCAIS.
Le Cercle Francais met last Thursday night in the Kappa Alpha hall. One of the most enjoyable programs of the
year was rendered. A. C. Summers and R. R. Deavor gave some French anecdotes, then T. F. Martin and C.
F. Wildman, in appropriate costumes, gave a dialogue between an American tourist and a French sales girl. Professor Hunt next
gave some interesting similarities between the pronunciation of French words and other words, illustrating them with cartoons. He also gave
illustrations of a game that the French are very fond of. Dr. Lingle was the last speaker on the program,
and he described the location and condition of the war-devastated areas. Then, after a short business meeting, the circle adjourned.
The next meeting, to be held in the middle of March, will be at the home of Professor Hunt.

to give the concert here. The program includes many popular choruses, character sketches, negro and Jew comedian stunts, and a
“jazz” orchestra. The Mooresville high school has invited the club up there, and a concert will be given there tomorrow

Fricker showed that “Industrial Representation” had proved the positive remedy for labor troubles, and he gave concrete examples which demonstrated
this as the true solution of a great problem of today.
