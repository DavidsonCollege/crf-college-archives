Davidson to dedicate Watson for studies of psychology and biology

COLLEGE COMMUNICATIONS Press Release

Davidson College will dedicate its new Watson Life Science Building and Baker-Watt Sciences Complex to the education of growing legions of students studying biology and psychology on Thursday, Oct. 1. College trustees and donors will join students, faculty, and staff on front campus for the ceremonies, which will begin at 5:30 p.m.

The college has just completed construction on the $13-million, 42,000-square-foot Watson Life Sciences Building. It is linked by the Blanche Knox Parker Garden and covered walkways to the existing Dana Science Building, and the two structures together form the Baker-Watt Science Complex. The College is also in the process of renovating Dana Building to bring it up to the standard set by Watson.

The new structure was named by its major donors, the Baker family of Norfolk, Va., and the Watson family of Atlanta, Ga. In 1995, Carolyn and the late Wayne M. Watson pledged the naming gift for the Watson Life Sciences Building. The Watsons’ daughter Bryna graduated from Davidson as a psychology major in 1982, and Wayne Watson was a lifetime member of the College’s Board of Visitors.

In honor of the gift of Drs. Frances and Lenox Baker of Norfolk, Va., the College is naming the entire complex in memory of the couple’s fathers, Dr. Lenox D. Baker, Sr. and Dr. James Watt. Dr. Lenox Baker is a 1963 Davidson graduate, and Dr. Frances Baker’s father, Dr. James Watt, was a 1931 graduate.

Construction of the complex answers a 15-year dream for members of the College family who have long recognized that biology and psychology share a scientific frontier. The boundaries between the two disciplines in such areas as behavioral medicine, health psychology, behavioral neuroscience, and mental health have become increasingly fuzzy, and their understanding requires cooperation between biologists and psychologists.

The project marks the first significant upgrade of life sciences program space since the opening of the Dana Science Building in the early 1960s. It also helps the College meet a growing demand from students for study of those disciplines. There are currently 200 junior and senior students majoring in biology and psychology — fully 25 percent of all students who have declared majors. The number of graduates with majors in psychology and biology has grown from a total of 33 in 1988-89 to 113 in the last academic year. More than 1,000 students will take at least one biology and one psychology course in the new building this year.

The Baker-Watt Complex should further polish Davidson’s outstanding reputation in biology and psychology education. The College ranks 21st in the nation in the number of graduates who have attained membership in the National Academy of Sciences, and the College has an outstanding record of preparing students for graduate school education in the sciences.

During the 1990s, the acceptance rate for Davidson graduates in medical schools is more than 90 percent, whereas the national average is 37 percent. In recent years, 30 percent of psychology majors have continued their studies in graduate school while another 20 percent have gone on to professional schools. Likewise, 22 percent of biology majors have gone on to graduate school and another 45 percent to professional schools. Fully 14 percent of the College’s alumni body — 2,300 graduates — are doctors and dentists.

Last year, eight biology students presented papers at the National Council for Undergraduate Research, the nation’s largest meeting dedicated to undergraduate research. Six psychology students also presented papers at professional meetings based on their individual or collaborative research.

The four-floor building more than doubles the amount of room available for instruction in these two programs. It also responds to a fundamental shift in pedagogy in recent years from the traditional lecture/laboratory presentation to open-ended, laboratory-based learning in small classes. The biology department space grows from 13,000 to 30,000 square feet, and from five teaching labs to nine, with 16 workstations each. Psychology will expand from less than 4,000 square feet of previous space to more than 11,000 now. It also provides space for the college’s nine psychology professors and 12 full-time biology professors to work together under the same roof for the first time.The Watson Building is the most technologically sophisticated building ever constructed at Davidson. Lighting is controlled by motion sensors, doors are secured by a card access system, and the labs include more than 80 new, fully networked computers. The computer technology gives students the capability for data analysis, modeling and simulation experiments, and multi-media equipment and video equipment allows professors to share on-screen data with an entire class. The basement includes a full-scale live animal facility with its own ventilation system and temperature controls in each room.

Chapel Hill professor and novelist Betts to speak at DCPC
By Jim Stuntz, College Communications

Doris Betts, novelist and Professor of English at UNC-Chapel Hill, will be at Davidson on Oct. 4 and 5 to speak and read from her work as part of the Staley Distinguished Christian Scholar Lecture Series. Betts will deliver the sermon at Davidson College Presbyterian Church’s 11 a.m. service on Sunday, Oct. 4. At 7 p.m. that night in the 900 Room of the Union, she will read from her novel-in-progress, “Who Is Sylvia?” On Monday, Oct. 5, Betts will give an address in the College Union 900 Room entitled “All I Know About Writing I Learned in Sunday School.” All events are free and open to the public.

Doris Waugh Betts is the author of six novels and three collections of short stories, among them three winners of the Sir Walter Raleigh Award for the best fiction book published by a North Carolinian in a given year. The winners include her first novel, “Tall Houses in Winter,” “The Scarlet Thread,” and “Beasts of the Southern Wild and Other Stories,” which was also a finalist for the National Book Award. Her 1994 novel, “Souls Raised from the Dead,” won the Southern Book Award and was named one of the best 20 books of 1994 by The New York Times. Her most recent book is “The Sharp Teeth of Love” (1997).

Betts also bears the distinction of being the first female full professor in the history of the University of North Carolina. From 1972-1978, she served as director of Freshman-Sophomore English at UNC-Chapel Hill, and she later served as Chairman of the Faculty for three years. Her tenure as Chairman of the Faculty earned her commendation as “the most personable and subtly effective Chairman of the Faculty in the history of the University.” Betts never completed a university degree. She has also served as a trustee of Union Theological Seminary in Richmond, Va. Betts is an elder in the Presbyterian Church in Pittsboro, N.C., where she and her husband are active members. She has spoken frequently about the connections between faith and literature.

The Staley Lecture Series was endowed in the 1970s by 1925 Davidson graduate Thomas F. Staley to provide chances to bring to Davidson College “distinguished Christian scholars” to speak on issues related to faith. Past speakers have included the author Frederick Buechner as well as theologians Tony Campolo and James Forbes. Betts’ lectureship will coincide with the festival of “Faith and the Arts,” a biannual celebration.
