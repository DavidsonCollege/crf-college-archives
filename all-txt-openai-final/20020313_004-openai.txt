**NCAA Tournament Bracket Breakdown**

**Look for Jayhawks to edge out Blue Devils in close final**

Will Roberson is in his fourth year as manager of the men’s basketball team. An aspiring coach, Roberson has worked
basketball camps at Duke, North Carolina, Wake Forest, and Michigan. He attended camp at Davidson for eight consecutive years. He
offers the following analysis for entertainment purposes only.

After correctly picking the Final Four last year, I realize that I simply cannot expect the same level of success.
And I know you think I'm boring for picking three No. 1 seeds to advance to the Final Four, but
let’s face it, they’re No. 1 for a reason. Let the madness begin!

**SOUTH:**

**Overview:** Duke probably has the easiest route to the Final Four of any of the top seeds. The Blue Devils’
toughest game before Atlanta will be a Sweet 16 duel with Southern Cal. This region features perhaps the best group
of double-digit seeds (see Bracket Busters below).

**Bracket Busters:**
- #12 Utah over #5 Indiana: Give Rick Majerus a week to prepare, and any team in America would be
in trouble.
- #11 Penn over #6 California: Penn enters the tourney on a roll, and only has to travel across the
state instead of across the country like the Golden Bears.
- #10 Kent State over #7 Oklahoma State: The Flashes defeated Indiana in the tournament a year ago, and will
pull off the upset once again.

**DBTH (Don’t Believe the Hype):**
- #3 Pittsburgh: The Panthers get lucky by hosting the first two rounds in their backyard, but will stumble once
they reach the Sweet 16.

**Going to Atlanta:**
- #1 Duke: The Devils are simply too talented for any of the teams in this region. Put them in
the West, and they have the potential to go home early. This team misses Battier and James more than they
think.

**WEST:**

**Overview:** Davidson gets sent packing to the toughest of the four regions, featuring 12 conference tournament champions, as well as
two immensely talented but underachieving squads in Missouri and UCLA.

**Bracket Busters:**
- #13 Davidson over #4 Ohio State: Obviously.
- #12 Missouri over #5 Miami (Fla.): Missouri was once ranked #2 in the country and have one of the
nation’s premier players in Kareem Rush.

**DBTH:**
- #6 Gonzaga: Sure, the Zags deserved a lot better than a #6 seed. But after a tough second-round game
with Arizona, don’t look for them to be around after the first weekend.

**Going to Atlanta:**
- #3 Arizona: The ‘Cats began the season unranked, but behind Jason Gardner and Luke Walton, have developed into one
of the nation’s best teams. The experience of reaching the championship game a year ago is an added plus.

**EAST:**

**Overview:** Like the South, the #1 seed has been set up for success. I don’t think that the other top
seeds will pose much of a problem for top-seeded Maryland.

**Bracket Busters:**
- #10 Michigan State over #7 NC State: The Spartans were hounded by injuries early in the year, and play
great half-court defense, a necessity for postseason success. UConn has reason to worry over itssecond round match-up. #11 Southern Illinois
over #6 Texas Tech: see below. DBTH: #6 Texas Tech: Bobby Knight certainly deserves national coach of the year consideration
for the turnaround in Lubbock. But a tough first-round draw means another early exit for The General.

Going to Atlanta: #1 Maryland: After stumbling in the ACC Tournament against NC State, the Terrapins will not enter the
Big Dance overconfident. Juan Dixon is easily one of my favorite players in the country.

Way To Go, Wildcats! Good Luck in the NCAA Tournament

MIDWEST: Overview: Another unfairly loaded bracket will make a tough road for any team. Whoever wins will surely be battle-tested.
#1 Kansas faces a potential road of Stanford, Illinois, and Oregon, just to reach the Final Four. Ouch.

Bracket Busters: #10 Pepperdine vs. #7 Wake Forest: This is the one that all the experts are picking, so it
probably won’t happen. But the Deacons have to travel across the country to face a team that has already defeated
Gonzaga, USC, and UCLA this season.

DBTH: #9 Western Kentucky: Sports Illustrated featured the Hilltoppers as a preseason Top 25 team. Now, everyone is predicting the
Hilltoppers to upset Stanford, but it’s not going to happen.

Going to Atlanta: #1 Kansas: The Jayhawks have the nation’s best frontcourt with Drew Gooden and Nick Collison. This is
the season Roy Williams was waiting for when he turned down the UNC job two years ago. Nice decision, by
the way.

THE FINAL FOUR:
Duke vs. Arizona: In a rematch of last year’s championship game, the ‘Cats will put a scare in Duke early,
but the Blue Devils will advance to the title game for the second straight year.

Maryland vs. Kansas: The best two teams in the nation face off in the semifinals. Maryland will find itself unable
to stop Gooden and Collison after Lonny Baxter gets in early foul trouble and a late Terrapin run falls short.

THE CHAMPIONSHIP:
Duke vs. Kansas: The match-up that everyone has been waiting for finally materializes. The Jayhawks win a see-saw affair 84-81
after Jason Williams misses a clutch free throw.
