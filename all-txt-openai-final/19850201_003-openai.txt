**College To Experiment With Locks On Dorm Doors**

By TED WILSON

The Physical Plant may test several dorm lock systems to determine the one best suited for the College’s needs. In
addition, SGA president John Laughlin spoke last week with President John Kuykendall concerning campus security. Kuykendall said Davidson has been
contacting other colleges concerning their dorm lock systems, and one or more of the new dorms may be used to
test different ones in the near future.

Laughlin said the locks would be installed “on an experimental basis to see if they’re effective or if a different
[system] should be used” and to determine how many and which dorms should have them. Director of Facilities Planning Grover
Meetze said “if the decision is made by the Dean of Students that this be done we can look into
the cost, fire code requirements,” and other regulations. He stressed that hall counselors and resident advisors should make sure the
locks on individual doors work properly.

Meetze said an electronic-type locking system on a dorm a few years ago was ripped off and destroyed by students,
who objected to it. He said as the dorm visiting hours became “more flexible, locked doors provided a problem.”

In other steps to increase security, the Raised Awareness and Protection for Everyone (RAPE) Committee has organized a student group
to “patrol the campus and act as a deterrent and to remind students about the constant need to use common
sense,” according to RAPE chairperson Melissa McLemore. The main functions of the organization are to patrol dimly lit areas, women’s
eating houses, back dorms, the gym area, and the campus perimeter; to remind women walking alone to walk in pairs
and to ask if they would like to be escorted home; and to have the patrollers and other students notify
Bill Warner, Kirk Gavel, or McLemore if they see any suspicious individuals or events. McLemore said if the patrollers see
a woman walking alone, she will “simply be nicely reminded that she should walk in pairs.”

The patrollers must stay in twos at all times and are to call the city police (892-5131) if they run
into trouble, instead of taking matters into their own hands. The guidelines require that patrollers wear identical armbands, and anyone
who sees a patroller alone or two students wearing different bands should call security. The patrols, which began last Monday,
send out student patrollers from 10 p.m. until 1:30 a.m. every night.

The SGA recently began a Student Escort Service, in which student volunteers escort women from the library to their dorms
at night. However, according to McLemore, the SGA is temporarily discontinuing the service due to lack of interest among women.
“The escorts aren’t being utilized,” she said, “so the SGA is holding it [the Escort Service] off this week, and
if there is no bad reaction to it stopping, it may not start again.”

McLemore said she’s proposing other methods to improve security on campus. “We're trying to set up escorts for parties,” she
said, as we have “major problems happening after parties.” She said the benefit is that “if a girl has been
drinking, she doesn’t have to rely on a student who is drunk” to escort her home. “If there is a
problem, we know who the escort is.” She said she had faith that each fraternity would delegate two guys to
remain sober at each party to serve as escorts; each brother would only have to do it once a semester.

**P.E. Grades To Appear On Transcripts**

By RICHARD CLOUDT

A proposal could be approved that would require grades from physical education classes to be included on student transcripts. According
to Sterling Martin, Director of Physical Education, there is now more room on transcripts to include extra information about the
fulfillment of P.E. requirements. In the past, only a statement indicating whether or not P.E. requirements had been completed was
included on transcripts. According to Martin, “Right now your transcript only says whether or not you’ve completed badminton. In the
future, it might state how you passed or failed and how many classes you skipped.”

Physical Education grades are included on grade reports now and are recorded but are not included on the sheet received
by prospective employers. The Faculty, Martin said, has not yet commented on the issue. In the past, however, faculty members
have generally supported the proposal. “I can’t speak for the faculty at this point in time but they have been
completely supportive of the proposal in the past,” Martin said.

Another proposal recently made by Dean of Students Will Terry, has met disapproval in the science departments. The proposal by
Terry to start classes at 8:20 a.m. “may put an unfair burden on approximately one-third of the student body,” biology
Professor John Williamson said. The proposal would, in part, move many early and mid-morning classes to the afternoon. According to
Williamson, this would create a domino effect that would leave no time for early afternoon labs. For science majors, the
proposal could mean having 4 or possibly 6 p.m. laboratory sessions. A ‘bug’ in the system the proposal would eliminate
is the 8 a.m. class. Williamson said not everyone wants an 8 a.m. class.Every term, but not many would want
a 4 p.m. class or lab. “We need to define the norm and go with it,” Williamson said, and added,
“I think the real world starts at 8 a.m. anyway.” He said people are more coherent in the morning than
in the afternoon, and that it is more preferable for many students to get things out of the way early
rather than having to worry about them when the day is almost over. There has not been any action on
the part of faculty members concerning the proposal so far.

Grover Meetze has to volunteer about once a year. McLemore said, “We could have a great improvement if we use
what we have more effectively.” She suggested having security officers patrolling more, going to the back dorms more often, and
“being seen” by students. She also recommended increasing the brightness of campus lights and adding more lights. McLemore met Wednesday
with the Presidential Executive Committee, whose members include Kuykendall and Dean of Students Will Terry. The meeting “went wonderfully,” she
said. “They wanted to know how they could help us achieve our goals, and were encouraging.”

Meetze said the administration “is not resisting change. We want suggestions as far as lighted areas and locks go.” He
said, “We just put one light behind the library to better light that area” where the all-night study room is.
“We're looking at all areas,” he added. Meetze said security is of utmost importance to the campus. He added, “There
is no evidence of any need to increase the [security] staff.” He said, “Inadequate security doesn’t seem to be the
problem. We have adequate coverage. Additional forces aren’t necessary at this time.”

Meetze recommended that the security officers go into all the dorm lounges regularly. A policy change adopted “by the Dean
of Students and the students” will be necessary to allow officers to go into dorms without specifically being called. He
emphasized the SGA is part of the campus security force. The responsibility for security is two-pronged: one is the Dean
of Students, [the other] the Physical Plant.” He said if the College wanted to have security to escort people, “We'd
have to determine how many we'd need, and start a whole new department.” Hence, he commends the work of the
Student Patrol for their work and “the SGA and Students for their awareness. We're enthusiastic about their attitude — getting
out fliers and talking about it — that's great.”

Meetze said, “More students should get involved in security. The most important involvement [of the] administration for students is with
security.” He said the best way to have direct contact between the administration and students concerning security is through the
SGA Security Committee. “They could explore the situation [of security], look at the past program and make recommendations to the
Administration.”

Meetze said four guidelines will help the security situation and help protect students: (1) concentrate on patrolling by Security in
areas of student activity; (2) take steps to reduce the debilitating influence of alcohol or other drugs at social activities;
(3) lock doors; and (4) call the police at 892-5131 immediately when aware of suspicious situations.

Tom Wolfe Returns Here

By JOHN GATHINGS

Noted author Tom Wolfe will return to Davidson April 9 as the 1984-85 Reynolds Lecturer. Wolfe traveled here five years
ago to judge the Vereen Bell writing awards and to speak at Spring Convocation. Gaining notoriety in the 1960s for
his satirical essays, Wolfe continues to focus on the unusual aspects of topical subjects. His books concern acid druggies, the
“well-known American Writer” X, and astronauts. His latest work is a serial currently running in Rolling Stone magazine entitled "The
Bonfire of the Vanities." In the style of Charles Dickens, Wolfe is having his story published in multi-chapter installments, spread
out over a year.

Not one to stick with traditional approaches, Wolfe is largely responsible for popularizing New Journalism. Instead of reporting straight facts,
Wolfe intersperses his reports with monologues and scenes. English professor Cynthia Lewis, chairperson of the Speaker's Committee, said that Wolfe
“has revived journalistic writing from flat documentary, stale style into energetic, contemporary, tense, and exciting style.”

His personal style is as offbeat as his literary style. Once popularly known as “the man in the white suit,”
Wolfe is selective with his wardrobe. Senior Thomas Evans, a nephew of Wolfe, said the author once wrote to his
mother and asked for a black shirt to distinguish himself from fraternity brothers dressed in white shirts and ties.

Spring As Reynolds Lecturer

Underneath his controversial public image, Evans said Wolfe is relatively conservative and agrees with many of President Ronald Reagan's ideas.
But mostly, Wolfe's personal thoughts are secret. Evans said, “I knew him, but I never knew him that well. I'm
just as fascinated by him as everyone else is.”

Wolfe's career got off to a slow start. After his undergraduate work at Washington and Lee and graduate work at
Yale, Wolfe got only one job offer out of 200 resumés sent to newspapers. The next two decades were spent
working on essays, books, and his less-known art. Wolfe draws caricatures. Evans said Wolfe has a surprisingly good watercolor he
painted at age six. The 53-year-old author is married and has one daughter.
