During last week, a full menu of sports was presented by the Wildcat golf, tennis, and track teams, all teams
coming through unscathed and with some measure of honor. As most of these events took place on the opponents’ home
grounds, we must comment not from observation but from reports.

Most credit should be given to the Davidson golf team which won for the first time the Carolina intercollegiate golf
championship. This aggressive team, composed of Jack Wagner, Sparrow Mills, Jack Pepper, and Tom Caldwell led the field against Carolina,
Duke, and State, who finished in the order named.

In the state tennis tournament, Davidson's representatives acquitted themselves nobly, but were unable to cope with Carolina’s team of champions,
and only two men, McLean and Dubose, were able to reach the quarter-finals. The singles finals will bring together Bryan
Grant, clay court champion, and Wilmer Hines, junior champion, both of Carolina.

Although V. M. I. brought one of the south’s strongest track teams to Davidson last Saturday, the Wildcat track men
performed brilliantly, and the match ended in a 63-all tie. Fleagle took his usual first in the 100 and 220
dashes, while George placed first in the 120-yard high and 220 low hurdles, and second in the 100-yard dash, garnering
11 points to tie with Smith of V. M. I. for high score. Both Fleagle and George seem to be
Davidson’s most consistent winners, and we predict that by 1931, Fleagle will be running the 100 in less than 10
flat. V. M. I.’s clean sweep of the 440 and 880 was unexpected, as was the failure of Brannon and
Earl to place first in the two mile and mile runs. Davidson’s entrants in these distance events were obviously badly
off form.

Inability to hit when hits meant runs seems to be one of the greatest defects in the Wildcat nine. This
was well illustrated in the recent game with Duke when bobbles by Duke allowed Davidson men to get on base—where
they were left stranded. However, McKeithan of Duke pitched excellent ball, and the ‘Cats couldn’t seem to locate him.

Rube Brandon, veteran umpire and victim of many a “razz,” says that a man as fast as Buck Mills should
bunt every time he comes to bat. We agree with the old maestro; when Buck starts running to first, he
reminds us of that well-known jack-rabbit of mythical legend.

Another fast man we have noticed is Goodson. Despite his name, we seldom see Sleepy asleep on the diamond anywhere
around second base, and he has saved many a Davidson pitcher when in a tight pinch.

Doc Mathis in right field has been covering his territory perfectly, as also has June Morrison in left field. June
has picked several apparent home runs from out of the hedge tops, much to the chagrin of opposing heavy hitters.

Taking everything into consideration, it would seem that the Wildcat nine is composed of some good individual players who don’t
seem to click well as a unit. We believe that despite the dearth of good pitching material, the home team
could win if several of the players would snap out of their hitting slumps. We know these players can hit,
because we’ve seen ‘em do it.

Today the ’Cats play Clemson at Clemson. Already, since this issue went to press, games have been played with South
Carolina and Erskine, and we believe that the warm climate of South Carolina will loosen up some of the old
soup-bones and boost some of the old batting averages.

V. M. I. Track Team Tries Hard and Ties Davidson In Exciting Meet 63-63

George and Smith Tie for High Score With 11 Points Each

The V. M. I. track team fought the Davidson Wildcats to a 63-63 tie here last Saturday afternoon, April 25,
in their dual meet. The Cadets overran Davidson's early lead to tie the score with a strong finish. It was
the exceptional strength of V. M. I. in the middle and long distance events that brought the match to a
tie, after the wins in the weights and dashes had given the ‘Cats what seemed to be a safe lead.

Grimy George was Davidson's high point man, having taken first place in the 120 high and 220 low hurdles and
third in the 100-yard dash. Fleagle also grabbed two first places by leading in the 100 and 220-yard dashes. Ham
Smith, V. M. I.’s iron man, tied with George of Davidson for high point man of the meet; each totalling
11 points for the afternoon. Smith took first in the mile and two-mile run and also second in the 880-yard
run. Romm, of V. M. I., also took two first places during the meet.

The results:
100-yard dash—Won by Fleagle; Shirley, V. M. I.; George. Time: 10.1 seconds.
220-yard dash—Won by Fleagle; Phillips, V. M. I.; Little. Time: 23 seconds.
440-yard dash—Won by Romm, V. M. I.; Gatewood, V. M. I.; Barkhurst, V. M. I. Time: 54.4 seconds.
880-yard run—Won by Romm, V. M. I.; Wise, V. M. I.; Smith, V. M. I. Time: 2 minutes 1 second.
Mile run—Won by Smith, V. M. I.; Wise, V. M. I.; Earle. Time: 4 minutes 42 seconds.
Two-mile run—Won by Smith, V. M. I.

Freshmen Win Decision Over Campbell College: Campbell Uses Three Pitchers in Attempting to Halt Freshmen

Bits of steady ball playing, coupled with timely hits and numerous errors, gave the Davidson Freshmen baseball squad an 11
to 4 decision over the Campbell College clan at Richardson Field, Monday afternoon. Campbell College used three pitchers in the
attempt to stop the Wildkittens’ scoring. The Frosh outhit the visitors, getting nine safe blows to six for Campbell. The
visitors scored one in the first and one more in the fourth, while the Kittens were held scoreless until the
fifth. With two men out, McClean, Campbell hurler, walked Koonce, hit Casali, and walked Smyre. McClean hit over the outfield,
scoring Koonce and Casali, but later on Smyre was put out coming into third, to retire the side. The Freshmen
scored three more in the sixth on three singles and a triple. Davidson scored in a big way in their
half of the eighth. They converted a walk, three hits and two infield errors into six runs. Campbell put across
their final tallies in their half of the same inning, scoring twice off of five safe hits and a base
on balls.

(Continued on page 5)Saturday with Captain Pritchett, varsity, and Heath Whittle, Freshman coach, for the State Track Meet, which will
be held at Greensboro Saturday afternoon and night. Twenty-six varsity men and eight Freshmen will compose the party which will
represent Davidson. Track universities and colleges from all over North Carolina are expected to take part in the competition, making
it a state-wide affair; and all indications are that the event will be keen. Again this year, the interest of
the sport-loving public in the state meet has been greatly aroused.

Captain Pritchett is taking his entire varsity team, which just closed one of the most successful seasons in Davidson's track
history. In dual meets with the schools of North Carolina this year, the Wildcats have displayed unusual ability, and if
they are running true to form, the other state teams will be in for a hard afternoon. Three relays will
be held, but Coach Whittle will enter only two teams, one in the sprint medley and another in the distance
medley.

The varsity men who will enter the meet, and the events they will enter, are:
Captain McCall, javelin and broad jump; Heagle, 100-yard dash and 220-yard dash; McCallie, high and low hurdles; Little, high and
low hurdles; George, high and low hurdles; Brannon, two-mile run; Earle, one and two-mile runs; McGehee, quarter-mile or relay; Tyack,
relay; Creech, relay; Boots Wilson, high jump; Allen, high jump; Martin, high jump; Flinn, pole vault and broad jump; Roane,
pole vault; Brock, pole vault and javelin; Brown, javelin; Stroud, pole vault; Hall, discus; Settis, discus; Boyle, discus and shot
put; Neal, 880-yard run and relay; Drake, 880-yard run; Howard, mile run; Cannon, 880-yard run and relay.

The Freshman team will have Moffett running the 440; Harrison the 220; Wright the 220, the 880, and the distance
medley; Halyburton will run the 440; Corbin the 880; Scott the three-quarter-mile, and Morrow the mile for the Wildkittens in
the sprint medley.

Baseball: Campbell College 2. Two-base hits, McClintock. Three-base hits, Hight. Struck out, by Koonce 1; by McClean 2; by Thigpen
0. Winning pitcher, Koonce.

Wildcats Defeated By Blue Devil Nine
On April 22, the Davidson Wildcats went down again under defeat, making the third this season, the Duke Blue Devils
winning by the score of 4 to 1. The Blue Devil hurler was invincible through most of the match, not
allowing a hit until the seventh inning. Croker, Davidson's moundsman, was saved three times in the early innings by the
brilliant fielding of his mates.
