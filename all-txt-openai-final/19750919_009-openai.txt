WHERE HEROES DARE: Senior Joe Duncan moves between two Madison Players in a 3-0 loss.

Dukes crush Cat booters

The Davidson soccer team dropped a 3-0 decision to the Madison Dukes last Friday in their opening match for the
1975 season.

Although the Cats failed to score, the match was much closer than the final score indicates. Davidson controlled the tempo
of the game, as the Cats controlled the ball for 52 of the game’s 90 minutes.

The Dukes capitalized on a charging infraction by Davidson early in the game, scoring on the direct kick.

The Cats had numerous scoring opportunities. Joe Duncan headed several shots which were stopped by the Madison goalie and his
direct kick was just wide of the mark. Billy Hawk chipped a shot that barely went over the bar, while
the Madison goaltender made a tremendous save of a shot by Tom Blackwood.

With ten minutes left in the game, the Cats trailed by only 1-0. The Cats made a costly error, however,
that allowed the Dukes to increase the margin.

Fullback Gary Dancigar kicked the ball toward goalie Bob Perz. But Perz was not expecting the pass and let the
ball get by him. Phil Barringer was alertly backing up the play. But his clearing kick deflected off a Madison
player and rolled into the goal.

As the game wound down to its conclusion, the wear became apparent on the Cats. Madison was able to get

Martin anticipates winning season

The 1975 Davidson cross country team appears to be one of the strongest of recent years. The Wildcats, coming off
last year’s 9-3 record, will be facing a tough schedule in which they run five of the seven conference teams.

Coach Sterling Martin feels that it is one of the strongest competitive schedules in many years, and this fact in
addition to the excellent record of last year will present a stiff challenge to the squad.

Leading the team will be junior co-captain Coty Pinckney, who won the most valuable award last season.

“Battling for second will be freshmen cake race winner Doug Horn and senior Fred Borch, much improved after a year
of competition in England,” said Martin.

“The loss of number two runner Bill McClemment will hurt, but Doug and Fred should fill his shoes. John Barksdale,
returning after a year’s absence, will add tremendous strength to the team, and senior co-captain Bill Cole, in the best
condition ever, should be in the top five,” commented Martin.

Martin is looking to seniors Jeff Neikirk, Jesse Smith, and Steve Scroggs to add important experience and depth to the
team. Sophomores Steve Justus, Zach Murrell, and Jay Silver all look good at this point and will make a significant
contribution this year, according to Martin.

Juniors Jim Douglas and Dave Rainey are running cross country at Davidson for the first time and will be joined
by freshmen Ed Anderson (second place finisher in the cake race), Bob Sweet, and Chris Friesinger.

The team ran High Point and Campbell in a triangular meet at High Point yesterday.
