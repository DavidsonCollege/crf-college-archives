**West, Phailbus to Speak**

**Honors and awards to be conferred at Fall Convocation**

**By DUNCAN FRASER '86**

Davidson College will confer honorary degrees on former governor of South Carolina and ambassador to Saudi Arabia John C. West
and President of Kinnaird College for Women in Lahore, Pakistan Mira Phailbus, during its annual fall convocation in Love Auditorium
at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow.

Davidson College President Dr. Samuel R. Spencer Jr. and Vice-president for Academic Affairs Dr. T. C. P. Zimmermann will preside

The main speaker at the convocation ceremony will be West, while Phailbus will deliver a short “Message from Pakistan” and
address a private luncheon following the convocation.

The Fall Convocation ceremony highlights Parents’ Weekend 1982 which will run November 5 through 7 and includes music by the

—The Thomas Jefferson Award which recognizes an outstanding professor among Davidson’s 100 faculty members.

character, good sportsmanship, and consideration of others.

Lt. Col. David W. Bauer, professor of military science and commander of Davidson’s ROTC unit, will present Department of Military
Science awards.

Additionally, a special $1000 scholarship award from Time magazine through the College Bowl Scholarship Foundation to Davidson College will be
announced in recognition of the Davidson College Bowl team’s achievement in the 1982 regional and national championship tournaments.

West graduated from The Citadel in 1942 and earned his law degree magna cum laude from the University of South
Carolina in 1948, after serving as a Major in the Army during World War II. He entered public service in
1954 as a South Carolina State Senator and served there until he was elected lieutenant governor in 1956. In 1970,
West was elected governor of South Carolina.

As governor from 1971-75, West traveled abroad encouraging foreign investments in the Sunbelt, particularly his own state of South Carolina.
He was quite successful in this area as today there are more than 150 foreign firms in South Carolina, employing
more than 35,000 people.

Following the expiration of his term as governor in 1975, West led a 15-person delegation of the South Carolina State
Development Board to Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait in search of business. West’s three-week trip yielded $14 million worth of
contracts for South Carolina firms and sharpened West’s reputation as a negotiator.

Former President Jimmy Carter invited West to become America’s ambassador to Saudi Arabia in 1977, a post he held for
the next four years. This period was a turbulent time in the Middle East as it included the Iranian hostage
crisis, the Iran-Iraq war, and the storming of the holiest mosque in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, by Moslem fanatics. During this
period, West skillfully conducted American diplomacy by persuading the Saudis to increase petroleum production to compensate for the Iranian shortfall
and gaining access to the top ranks of the royal Saudi Arabian government.

West has since retired from government service and conducts a law practice in Hilton Head Island, S.C., continuing to promote
business interests between Middle Eastern and domestic companies. Furthermore, West is convinced that peace in the region depends on finding
a solution to the Palestinian situation and warns that America must develop alternative energy sources to avoid another oil shortage.

Phailbus has been principal (equivalent of president) of the 600-student Kinnaird College for Women since 1972, shortly before all colleges
in Pakistan were nationalized. She is credited with continuing the college’s independent Christian perspective in the transition to a government
school in this Moslem nation. Kinnaird is considered to be the premier women’s school in Pakistan as evidenced by 80
percent of its students passing a national exam in a country where the average is 26 percent.

**Anorexia examined at Rusk**

**BY PAULETTE KURANI '86**

Rusk House hosted a panel discussion on Anorexia Nervosa entitled “Everything You Always Wanted to Know about Anorexia But Were
Afraid to Ask” on Monday, 8 November. The Committee on Women’s Concerns and the Y-Block on Nutrition sponsored the talk.

The panel consisted of Dr. William Skeen, a family physician from Mooresville; Dr. Barbara Ballard, a psychologist from Charlotte and
part-time counselor in Davidson; Ms. Anita Jolly, a clinical dietician in Charlotte; and two Davidson students, Pam Steadman and Marian
Hill, both former anorexics.

Contrary to popular belief, Anorexia Nervosa is not a new illness, even though it has increased by 50 percent in
the last five years, and it is primarily a female disease, although a few male anorexics exist.

“Nobody knows exactly why Anorexia is more prevalent today,” said Dr. Skeen, “but the changes in society may have a
great bearing on it. Young women now seem to be more susceptible to anxiety and depression and less able to
cope with them than women in the past.”

According to the panel, the concept of beauty, which gradually changes through time, is also another factor in the increase,
as young women strive for the perfect, thin female figure so emphasized in the media.

Anorexia is not limited to any personality type, said Dr. Ballard. The women who get it are usually of average
or above average intelligence, and come from economically stable families. It is an emotional problem and can be the re-
