**“Too Clever” plays at Hodson Hall**

By JENNIFER SIECK

The questions of “who,” “where” and “when” accentuate the crucial question of “what” in Alexander Ostrovsky’s “Too Clever by Half,”
or “The Diary of a Scoundrel.” The who, where and when, however, introduce the audience to a variety of people
in places as far away as Moscow and as close to home as Washington, D.C. The action starts in 1868
and continues through 1984.

The main character who both conducts and follows the rest of the cast is Egor Glomov/George Glumier/Giorgio Glumonini/George Glumerson/George Glumer
played by Brian Kosanovich. He is assisted by his mother, Glafira Glumova/Jeanie Glumier/Glynis Glumerson played by “Molly” Gettys Bass and
their servant Styopka/Stopperman played by Joseph Maris.

The action begins a few weeks after the death of Egor’s father (Glafira’s husband). (“God rest his soul.”) Egor decides
to use his multitudinous and diverse talents to regain a place in society for himself and his mother, to land
a prestigious job and to marry the “well-endowed” niece of the wealthy widow, Madame Sofya Turusina/Madame Turusine/Signora Sofia Turuso/Lady Sophie
Torrison/Sophie Turro, played by Alyssa Kendall. The niece, Mashenka/Marciella/Marcel/Marsha, is played by Erika Augthun.

The characters whom Egor encounters on his journey to success are found in one guise or another wherever he goes.
His skills and virtues are soon noticed and praised by all. His challenge and enjoyment is to juggle relationships with
every character while interacting with them.

As he progresses on his “project,” Egor candidly records his dealings with the other characters in his diary.

The audience and characters are conducted from place to place and from time to time by means of different costumes
and interior decor. Music of appropriate culture and time between scenes also reveals where and when the audience should imagine
being next. All of the characters, despite other changes they might make, wear wigs throughout this comedy, and, with the
exception of Mashenka, have transparent masks which cover the top part of their faces. One must make additional observations about
the function of their masks while watching the play.

This play is visibly a result of diligent and caring work by the many people involved, both actors and the
essential people who work behind the scenes. “Too Clever by Half” is fun to see and be a part of.
The players, having performed before different sizes of audiences, prefer larger ones. The players seem to be having fun themselves,
while sincerely presenting their characters and the more serious theme of the play with proficiency and grace. Performances will begin
again this Thursday the 26th, continuing through Saturday the 28th.

Be wise and come and enjoy this cleverness! You can decide who or what, anything or anyone, turns out to
be “too clever by half.”

I would like to wholeheartedly recommend the Southpark Cinema to anyone who is choosing between theaters. The place is spacious,
and the screens are large. It well describes what I envision all theaters should be. Check it out.
