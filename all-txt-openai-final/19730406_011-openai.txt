New Teams In IMAC By BLOCAY and AMERICA

Nurmng on the PMA scene this week, a startling new addition has been made to the already humongous list of
teams. For the first time, an America direct from a lengthy engagement comes the all-new Pope and his Court, establishing
an intern Vatican in Grex House. Pope Ralph has surrounded himself with a court that includes renowned scholars from the
local area such as Drs. King, Weine, Avinger, and Cornwell. Ah yes, and there is also Dr. Jackson, one of
the great major league scouts, Billy "Sever" Jackson. All the stage and Jackson sacrum players. Other clowns in the court
include such celebrities, and we're sure you know them, as the "Moultrie Mad Dog" Creasman, who will anchor the infield
between trips to the fire hydrant. "Mad Dog" is a preseason contender for CA and Young Buck's coveted dummy Piersall
Award because of unexpectedly slow recovery from a mental breakdown given to him by his boys on toast last year.
Larry Duncan, the Court's first baseman and part-time steamboat preacher, will also return for what he says is his last
year. Hope so. On the hill for the Pope's boys (Staff photo by Goodman).

Davidson Defeated By Tough Spiders
By CHARLES SLAGLE
Staff Writer

Richmond's sprinters proved to be too much Tuesday as the Spiders beat the Davidson track team 80-74. Davidson, however, looked
good in defeat, and Coach Sterling Martin was pleased with his team's performance. The team is young, and their performance
Tuesday enables Martin to go into their triangular meet at Appalachian against Appalachian and V.M.I. with optimism.

Two Davidson school records were broken in this meet. Eppa Rixey led a sweep of the high jump by breaking
the record with his jump of 6'5". Tim Rogers, who just started working out, came in second at six feet.
John Stanfield placed third. The other record was established by Jeff Diller in the hammer throw in which he placed
second. His throw was 107'2". Diller also placed third in the javelin.

Ricky Ben was the only Wildcat who won two events in the meet. He won the mile and then led
a sweep of the three-mile. Rick Deal and Ron Clark came in second and third in the three-mile race. Besides
sweeping the high jump and the three-mile, Davidson also swept the 440 and the discus. Larry Hill led the way
in the 440 followed by Chris Gomez and Tim Walker. Walker and Hill also ran in the mile relay which
Davidson won. David Crumpler won the discus with Steve Shankweiler second and Allen Shaberg placing third. All three threw the
discus over 130 feet.

Bob Lautensack ran a gutsy race and won the 880 in a time of 2:02.3. Woody Van Meter continued from
last year and won the pole vault at 13'1", which is two inches below his own school record. The meet
was lost, however, at the sprints where Richmond's Jim Detwiler and Pete Macheras dominated. Detwiler won both the high hurdles
and the 440 intermediate hurdles while Macheras won the 100 and 220. Davidson could only muster thirds in the 100
and 220 by Mark Connors, who like all the Davidson sprinters, was a 440 man until this year. Greg Love
placed second in the high hurdles and Dave Peaco came in third in the intermediate hurdles at 58.seconds, only one
second off the school record. Ske Bavidsenian 9 p01! 6.1973
