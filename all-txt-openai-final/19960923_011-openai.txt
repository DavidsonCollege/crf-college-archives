_OPINIONS_

**Evolution of (Davidson) man**

Having given the freshman a few words of advice, I thought it might be nice to give the ones who
lived through First Night a glimpse of what the next couple of years are going to be like. Not knowing
the first thing about women, I had to confine myself to Davidson men.

**1st Semester:**
General emotional state: Nervous, excited, hyper, but for the most part, healthy. Having come from high school, where the only
thing easier than getting liquor is getting beer, first semester freshmen will have one major change to deal with—no kegs
at Davidson parties. Not that they go to parties anyway. Social activities center around throwing up out of various dorm
room windows, fighting with a roommate, and saran wrapping toilet seats. A major weekend would include dropping a watermelon down
the Belk stairs, which is pretty funny unless you’re the guy drunk enough to try to catch it; and watching
a movie starring lots of actresses with one name. Once the Court opens up, new freshmen are exposed to the
exciting world of vicious upperclassmen, stale beer, and large policemen. The main academic pursuits of the first semester freshmen are
finding classes in Chambers and figuring out where all the women from the Facebook have gone.

**2nd Semester:**
General emotional state: Nervous as hell, screechy, fragile, but generally not unhealthy. After the spectacularly misnamed Self Selection Night, the
frat-boy wannabes are quickly introduced to the joys of pledging, such as public exposure to both the elements and the
entire student body, waking up in unfamiliar and economically disadvantaged sections of strange cities, and becoming brothers with twenty new
guys who are exactly like you, right down to the almost new Eddie Bauer Explorer. On the flip side, you
get lots of free beer, whether you want it or not. For guys who don’t pledge, the main social activity
is making fun of those who do. Academic pursuits include sleeping through a mindless litany of survey courses, or worse,
Humes, and explaining to Dad why that scholarship wasn’t really that important anyway.

**3rd Semester:**
General emotional state: Wary, frustrated, edging toward psychosis. Social activities of the third semester freshmen, or sophomores, as they are
also called, are centered around endless frat parties, falling off of high places like tables, desks, fraternity walls, etc., and
blacking out. Intense sexual frustration sets in after being turned down by nine freshmen and a check-out girl at Lowe’s.
(You know—the blonde one, works the Express Lane.) Drastic measures, such as going to Queens, only seem to make matters
worse because the doctor’s bills eat into your beer money. Academically, sophomores are asked to prove they are the geniuses
they were told they were in high school by answering questions like “If Chairman Mao and a mature sewer rat
fought to the death, who would win, and why? Discuss using outside sources.” Nagging questions about disturbing things like direction
and jobs keep coming up.

**4th Semester:**
General emotional state: A delicate balance between suicidal and homicidal. Generally unhealthy. Social activities are the same, except now there
are pledges to bring you beer and roll you onto your stomach. Take road trips to every college and university
in the Southeast but find no life there either. After being the first person in the history of Davidson to
be carded for cigarettes at Dover’s, you briefly entertain the idea of jumping off the water tower. The drive for
intellectual enlightenment stalls out around the first day of spring, and is killed off by the summer job prospects of
either being an office monkey for a group of TV-advertising mall lawyers or working on the processing line at the
Tyson plant like all of your high school friends. Most sophomores decide to go abroad the first semester of their
junior year. Don’t say you weren’t warned.

**WE'RE TRAPPED IN A VICIOUS CYCLE HERE**

WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

A SITUATION IN WHICH THE EFFORT TO SOLVE A PROBLEM ONLY RESULTS IN THE AGGRAVATION OF THE PROBLEM, OR CREATES
A NEW, EVEN WORSE PROBLEM.

YOU MEAN THE MORE WE TRY TO MAKE THINGS BETTER THE WORSE WE END UP FEELING?

Fdd!'07- COMMUNICATE OPENLY AND WITHOUT FEAR, I... IT Love you, AND I... I LOVE YOU. SO MUCH FOR BEING TRAPPED
IN AN ENDLESS CYCLE OF RESENTMENT AND NEGATIVITY! BY THE WAY, THE TERM IS “VICIOUS CIRCLE," NOT “VICIOUS CYCLE," SEPTEMBER
23, 1996 11 Patterson Court Council On “God Save the Court” In response to some issues raised and accusations made
in the Opinions article “God Save the Court”:

1. Confusing system? The system was designed by the students in an effort to soften the blow of losing kegs
on Patterson Court and provide for a period of transition. The plan offers more options for the organizations and gives
the organizations more flexibility and responsibility in managing their own events. Each organization, in fact, has submitted its own version
of how it will do a better job of distributing that information to ALL students, so any confusion can be
addressed.

2. Amount of personnel? The number of required personnel is less than last year—and it’s easier to identify someone to
work the events! One Risk Manager (from a list of over seventy TIPS trained people as opposed to only twelve
last year), at least one TIPS-trained bartender, and at least one entrance monitor to check ID’s, PCC stickers, and distribute
wristbands. And police officers will work in “zones” on the court to monitor general safety and security, not at every
single house the entire time like watchdogs. These changes save the organizations money AND offer more control and responsibility to
the organization.

3. Forms and paperwork? The house, members, or guests have no additional paperwork mandated by the administration. Wristbands and Patterson
Court Stickers were used in the past and continue to be used. The houses register parties in the same manner,
although the form has been simplified. The Risk Managers complete the same checklist as they have in the past, which
communicates party procedures and occurrences to the Patterson Court Office after an event.

4. Quantity limits? The quantity limits are clearly outlined in Red Book Section V.18 (page 31) for organization-sponsored or combination
events and Section VI.3.b (page 32) for BYO events (as the bold-face heading indicates). A typographical mistake labels BYOB limits
as VIII.3.b.

5. Organization Categories? Calling an event “organization sponsored” is simply describing how that event is different from the other two
categories of events. Alternative suggestions for that category’s label can be submitted to the Patterson Court Council. It does not
violate any terms of the women’s eating houses’ insurance policies, so the issue is really whether the College should be
disguising reality for the benefit of the fraternities who are making informed decisions about their event management. The Patterson Court
Council is unaware that any officers have resigned over this issue, but the policy changes offer more opportunities for protection
if the organizations have knowledge of and are adhering to their individual risk management policies.

6. Anti-Court sentiment? The infamous Self-Study document clearly indicates the College’s willingness to maintain Patterson Court as an institution. In
fact, it supports the growth of the court through its recommendation championing a fourth women’s eating house or a co-ed
eating house. Students and staff worked together throughout the spring to address some concerns about Patterson Court operations and remain
united about the value of the Patterson Court experience for many students and alumni. Patterson Court as a viable aspect
of campus life will continue, but it does not exist in a vacuum. As a society evolves and continually redefines
such issues as organizational liability and personal freedoms and responsibility, Patterson Court will also evolve to meet these challenges with
enough confidence in its purpose and processes that it can withstand scrutiny, accept constructive criticism, and set the standard for
personal and organizational excellence.

7. Purpose of the Court? We finally agree on something. The court is about leadership, service, and friendship. The well-rounded
Davidson undergraduates it helps to produce are important, which is why we found it worth saving. Patterson Court save Patterson
Court. The Patterson Court Council meets at 7:00 p.m. on Sundays in the Union Conference Room. Guests are always welcome.
