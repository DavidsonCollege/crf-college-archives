### Activities

#### MID-WEEK BREAK

**Wednesday, June 18** - Hotdogs and cokes served. Attendance: estimated 125, 15 girls - 5 members of the Faculty and
Administration. Songs by the group, led by Tom Covington. Some danced, and two couples played bridge.

**Wednesday, June 25** - Food to be served: ice cream sundaes. Promise not to run out of food this time!
Suggested title: Have sundae - Will eat! Same general setup: girls - short entertainment - music.

#### MID-SUMMER'S DANCE WEEKEND

**July 12** - Big plans are being made. The Dance Committee is making arrangements, and the type of dance will
be decided by results of Tuesday morning poll taken in Chapel. It is hoped that a sufficient number of students
will show enough interest to permit our having a good combo from Charlotte. Places will be provided for dates to
stay.

#### BRIDGE TOURNAMENT

There was a bridge tournament in the College Union on Thursday night, June 19. Mr. Postell presided, and prizes of
new decks of bridge cards were awarded. George Rhyne, Mrs. Sid Cox, and George Gladstone were among the winners. A
bridge party for next week and a master point tournament in the near future had been planned; however, these will
be canceled, due to the poor attendance on last Thursday, unless there is further interest.

### ADVICE

by - Ed Slanders

**Dear Mr. Slanders:** I am 23 years old and very much in love, but lately I've had my eyes on
another girl. I would like to date her very much, but my friends tell me she has a bad reputation.
Should I date her and be corrupted or remain true to my love?
**SKEETER**

**Dear Skeeter:** Do what any red-blooded American boy would do! THINK!

**Dear Ed:** What can a girl do when she is asked to go on more dates than she can possibly
accept?
**POPULAR**

**Dear Popular:** Be thankful!

### ADVICE (continued)

**Dear Mr. Slanders:** Lately I have noticed that my wife has been going through my billfold and taking money without
telling me. This greatly annoys me, especially since she has been bringing home large quantities of lollipops. Should I call
a halt to this?
**ANNOYED**

**Dear Annoyed:** Call a halt or develop an overwhelming appetite for lollipops!

**Dear Mr. Slanders:** I don't know why, but lately people have been calling me all sorts of names, like dirty,
stinky, and "Halitosis Kid". I have begun to develop a complex. Please tell me what to do.
**COMPLEX**

**Dear Complex:** Take a bath, use deodorant, and brush your teeth!

(For a personal reply to your problems, write Ed Slanders, Box 1368, Davidson, N.C.)

What a miserable world! â€” trouble if we love, and trouble if we do not love.

### A PUNNY PUN for the punny personality
