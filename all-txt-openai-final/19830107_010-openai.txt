**Billy Bob Meets Santa**

**Booze Brothers experience close shave with insanity**

Over Christmas break, the BB had a close shave with insanity. What we saw will continue to haunt us forever. It happened like this:

Heading south on I-85 outside of Atlanta, we realized it was time to eat. We ducked into a convenience store to get the news on where we could enjoy a decent semi-feast. The girl behind the counter with wire-rim glasses and matching braces gave us our options: McDonald's, a Pakistani kebab emporium, or a very expensive French restaurant featuring valet parking and outlandish prices for red meat. We shook our heads simultaneously in disgust. Then Ms. Metal suggested what was to be our “bright and clever hell” for the evening. Pizza? Sure! And with that, we jumped in the car and proceeded unknowingly to our destination . . . somewhere near the outer reaches of anti-reason.

The exterior of this restaurant revealed nothing about what waited inside for us. However, we did notice a run-down, balding family man waiting near the entrance, holding a blue balloon in his hand. Why?! We pressed on. Nearing the entrance, we noted that the building was way too large to be just a pizza restaurant. We noticed a sign next to the door: “Tonight: Billy Bob meets Santa.” Our curiosity piqued, we entered. We weren’t ready for what we saw.

Screaming children darted through a labyrinth of sound and light. Disregarding the shrieks and howls of the demonic little sprites, we beheld before us nearly 50 or more video games smiling at us as machines sometimes will. As we stumbled onward from one large room to the next, we came upon the musical entertainment for the evening: huge mechanical animals, maybe four or five, and they were . . . singing. We heard these horrible monsters sing Christmas pop songs. The chanting of the crowd—all small children—was unbearable. We came upon machines that produced helium-filled balloons, a contraption that lays eggs with small prizes in them (while the mechanical chicken demonically cackles), and a device that offers young, impressionable minds the chance to spar with the anti-Christ himself. This game was called “Whack-a-Demon.” The idea here is for the child to use an oversized mallet and smash the little pistons with the devil’s face on them as they pop up . . . one after the other. Absolutely horrifying. The next room down the corridor featured football on a big screen: a quiet refuge for burned-out parents who eventually grow tired of the hellish squealing of their piglets. We noticed Santa cowering near the phone booths, hiding from the children.

We ordered a deluxe pizza and with our order received one token each enabling us, with the help of these smiling machines, to embark on a senseless killing rampage. Between us, we destroyed 28 robots, 5 fighters, and leveled New York twice. However, the machines were teasing us, they dealt with us handily . . . smiling all the while. That’s when a horrible paranoic thought became etched on our collective mind: are these “people” here actually human or are they, too, products of a machine? Obviously, there was no answer, so we quickly finished our pizza and got the hell out.

As we fumbled for the car keys, we stole one last glance at Show Biz Pizza and all we could think about were huge, yellow smiling face buttons impaling all of humanity one by one with their sharp pins. As you can tell, at this point we were absolutely livid and were lucky to make it back to the interstate.

Show Biz Pizza Inc., a restaurant-entertainment chain slowly strangling the southeastern United States, has a location in Charlotte: “Chuck E. Cheese’s Pizza Time Theatre” on 4120 E. Independence Blvd.
