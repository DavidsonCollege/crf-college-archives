Field Hockey Drops Pair to Pfeiffer and Wake Forest

By LARRY DAGENHART, JR.

The Davidson Field Hockey team had another week of misfortune as the Wildcats dropped games 2-1 to Pfeiffer College and
4-0 to Wake Forest University.

In the Pfeiffer game, Davidson jumped out to an early lead off a goal from senior Janet Bitter. Despite many
scoring opportunities, including 20 shots, it was the only goal the Cats could muster.

Junior goalie Elizabeth Franklin played the entire game and ended up with 16 saves for the afternoon. “She had some
strong saves and was very good under pressure,” said coach Betsy Pryor.

Davidson revisited ACC country Wednesday, losing to Wake Forest 4-0. The Deacons pounded the Wildcats with 14 shots and three
goals in the first half, the first two coming in the first three minutes.

Reserve goalie Alison Chapman relieved Elizabeth Franklin in the second half and came away with 16 saves, enough to please
coach Pryor. “Wake had some strong players, some great plays and their stickwork was superior. Elizabeth was a real bright
spot.” The Cats were simply outplayed.

Davidson (1-6) gets to play Salem College, the only team they have beaten so far this year, this Wednesday at
4:30.
