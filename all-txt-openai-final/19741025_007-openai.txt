happening now, not to mention reflec-
ting on recent experiences which
squirm unsifted in my mind. At times,

my emotional sanity requires that I
disregard academic pressures and re-
establish touch with myself.

Because there usually isn’t time for
that, I take time out for it. It is time
taken from studying, and the price is
high.

I think we all know our need to
break into our drab and bastioned
study days with felt meanings.

Whether it be the hilarity and

carefreeness of a night at Hattie’s or a
calm celebration of caring with
friends or the staging of screaming
matches with the dorm across the
way, it’s
time for it.

Most of this talk takes place in
private to the trusted, or over a beer,

or late at night when the studying is

done.

It’s almost always extracurricular.
If talk of these needs enters the public
arena at all, it is usually in the form of
frustrated whispers in the stacks or
late night howlings in the dorms.

Generally, you must listen very

Academics Thwart ‘Community iT

How many times have we heard
ourselves say it? There is something

dreadfully wrong with a commitment -

to. academics which keeps us from
spending enough time with each
other, -

I’m not talking about the com-
mitment to academics itself, for I too,
have made it, and in no way - regret
that choice. . ..

Nor am I whining about not having
enough time to do everything I want to
do. I know there are just so many
hours in the day, and we all do the best

we can to get our work done and

perhaps to meet some of our personal
needs .

What I’m talking about is a com-
mitment to work that is so total that it
suffocates a commitment to love. It is
this work mentality that binds us
