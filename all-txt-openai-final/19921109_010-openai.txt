THE DAVIDSONIAN SPORTS MONDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 1992

Continued from page 12
ter, Davidson embarked on what
would be the game-winning drive.
Richard Howell, who replaced
starter Kevin Holzworth after the
first quarter, led the ‘Cats on a
massive 20-play, 80-yard drive
which lasted nearly nine minutes.
He completed six of seven passes
on the drive, including a 20-yarder
to a triple-covered Isaac Bailey;
Davidson converted five of six
third-down conversions and a
fourth-down conversion. Howell
scored the touchdown himself, roll-
ing left and scooting around sev-
eral defenders to put Davidson up
for good. Benoist’s extra point gave
the ‘Cats their 10-3 advantage.

Smith remained focused on
the team’s accomplishments after
the game. “We were all believing
in each other on that final drive,”
he said. “Martin (McCann) put
pressure on their quarterback, and
I was fortunate enough to be there
for the interception.”

Neither club managed overly
impressive offensive statistics, as
Davidson outgained Centre 219-
214 in yardage. Howell completed
13 of 18 passes for 99 yards;
Holzworth was two of five for 33
yards. Dan Lamar caught four
passes for 35 yards, and Bannister
gained 49 yards on 14 rushing at-
tempts.

Linebackers McCann and
John Dalton each recorded 11 tack-
les, and three of Dalton’s were for
losses. The deciding factor was in
the turnover column; Smith inter-
cepted a pair of Lyons passes, and
he and nose guard Braulio Lopez
each recovered a fumble.
Davidson, on the other hand, did
not turn the ball over.

Before the season began, the
club’s goals were to win its first
game and improve on last season’s
4-5 mark. Davidson defeated
Guilford 18-3 to open its season.
With a victory at Bridgewater
(Va.), a team the ‘Cats crushed 30-
7 at home in ‘91, it will finish the
‘92 campaign with a 5-5 record.
