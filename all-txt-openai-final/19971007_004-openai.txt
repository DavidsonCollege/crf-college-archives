**Inauguration a success**

Just as the balloons are still suspended in the air at the Commons, so does the inaugural air remain on
campus. Keeping with the spirit of the inauguration of Davidson’s 16th president, Bobby Vagt, it is appropriate to reflect on
past presidential inaugurations covered by the Davidsonian.

Cunningham, president from 1941-1958, was the first to be reported by the Davidsonian.

Cunningham was inaugurated as the 12th president of the College before over 100 representatives from other colleges and universities, much
in the same fashion as President Vagt’s inauguration.

The Davidson Band led the long procession to the tune of “Pomp and Circumstance” on Saturday morning, Oct. 18, 1941.
The entourage formed along the walk between the Eumean Literary Hall and the Philanthropic Literary Hall. This year’s inauguration also
noted the societies’ historic role with their active participation in the inaugural exercises.

Dr. Lingle, a Davidson leader, reviewed the qualifications of a Davidson President. He must be a Christian gentleman, a scholar,
and a good businessman, Lingle said. He must also possess leadership, be able to “get along with faculty,” and have
the ability to promote good relations between the College and the Church.

Cunningham accepted the vows of inauguration that were reflective of the time period. These concerned a belief in the Scriptures
as the word of God, the teaching of discipline in the Presbyterian Church, and the acknowledgment of his Christian duty
to the College. Accordingly, “The Church College and Tomorrow” was the topic of Cunningham’s Inaugural Address.

Following Cunningham and the interim president Dr. Pieterspol, Grier Martin became the 13th president of Davidson. The former treasurer and
business manager of the College, Martin advanced to the presidency in 1958. The appointment of Martin was unique in that
he was not a minister or educator.

**Inaugurations differ, stay the same**

“We are convinced that Grier Martin is the man for the job,” Dr. J. McDowell Richards said, “although he does
not fit into any of the preconceived ideals of a Davidson College president.”

In its report of the selection of Martin, the Davidsonian noted that “he is not a minister and has no
impressive string of academic degrees... but ability has a way of making itself evident.”

Although there was no formal account of the inaugural proceedings in the Davidsonian, the inauguration followed tradition, complete with speeches
from distinguished scholars and former alumni.

Dr. Samuel R. Spencer, Jr., became Davidson’s 14th president on Oct. 11, 1968. Spencer’s installation service broke with the usual
pattern for a presidential inauguration.

“It will be a simple installation service, in place of a formal inauguration,” Spencer said. But Spencer set the tone
in his own way by challenging the class of 1972 to “give a damn.” Surely, President Vagt expects the same
from today’s students.

Trustees, institutions of higher learning, and academic associations gave Vagt a series of Presidential greetings.

As self-proclaimed “poet laureate,” SGA President Buster Burke composed a poem in honor of President Vagt’s inauguration:

“In the halls of Little and the BSC, at the track and union that are to be, in classrooms and
the Chambers lobby, stands half man half cat, a thing called Bobby.”

Vagt’s acceptance address will not be soon forgotten, as he urged students to work on instituting their ideals through a
constant process of questioning.

“I liked his speech because he doesn’t want us to live in the Davidson bubble,” freshman Jessica Blackburn said. “He
doesn’t want us to be cynical, yet he wants us to be aware.”

Having already established an esteemed reputation as a leader in the college community, Vagt apparently has much to offer through
his creativity and compassion.

After hearing his address, freshman Dan Lewis said, “I want to get to know him.”

“I was impressed with his speaking ability,” said senior Katie Parker.

After the inauguration, the audience attended a luncheon on the lawn in honor of President and Mrs. Vagt.

Overall the inauguration was successful and concordant to Vagt’s style. “It was a worthy experience for all,” said freshman Tony
Murono.

**Thanks to everyone -- Trustees, Faculty, Staff, and students -- for making October 3rd, the Inauguration of our 16th President,
Robert F. Vagt, a wonderful day in every way. We were all part of history-in-the-making.**
