For Diversity: Say Goodbye to Clusters, Eating Houses ~ Control

Continued from page 8

Students would have no choice but to open their eyes to the prospective friend living with them. This measure can
go even farther. Davidson’s small size does not lend itself to variety. Minorities fill only a minuscule portion of the
total enrollment. For the same reasons mentioned before, minorities might wish to room together; they often share similar backgrounds and
interests. These cliques should be discouraged. If Davidson students need exposure to alternative elements, minorities must live as far apart
as possible. Not only will they learn from such an experience, the rest of the students’ exposure to minority culture
and lifestyle will be distributed equally throughout campus. A forced separation from friends may seem unpleasant, but in order to
make the school more appealing to minorities, everyone must sacrifice some luxuries.

We cannot end our reform with just housing. Cancers appear everywhere in the Davidson community. The most obvious offenders are
social organizations. Fraternities, the BSC, and the women’s eating houses do little to foster diversity and understanding. Disbanding them and
forcing randomly assigned seats in the Commons (to be reassigned weekly, of course) would solve that problem quickly and painlessly.
The resulting lull in social activity would not discourage prospective students, especially with the exciting 900 Room activities: the Tibetan
Monks' last visit provoked hysteria, and who could forget that speaker on the North Carolina State Legislature. Furthermore, the community
service performed by eating houses and fraternities would most likely continue despite the lack of organization and drop in incentive.

With these enormous cliques conquered, other seemingly innocent and non-threatening organizations may replace them. FLAG, New Vagabonds, and Club Tennis
might harvest lasting friendships amongst similar people, thus necessitating their destruction. If worse comes to worst, the Honor Council may
have to go. Strong friendships pervade every aspect of college life. For us to force these friendships aside in order
to create new ones, we must intensify our efforts. In the past, these efforts involved Bonus Bucks: a tempting lure
away from house food to the Commons. Though well planned, students imagined shortcomings in the deal. On the social scene,
the Outpost experienced limited success on weekends. Its video game and jukebox attract only a few as a party alternative.
The failure of these innocent plans to affect student behavior forces us to switch to more aggressive tactics.

All social groups must cease to exist. We must desegregate all types of people. If need be, court orders should
be procured to keep friends from speaking. We must set aside the interests of the students to ensure a diverse
campus. We must disregard the inevitable ensuing discontent in order to guarantee a peaceful, friendly student body. This college will
triumph over intolerance and misunderstanding, even if it comes to confiscating every student’s personal freedom for the duration of their
sentence. We cannot have sufficient harmony on campus without sufficient control.

Guitarist Dave Pirner was extremely drunk but never missed a note. If you saw the MTV Inaugural Bash, ol’ Dave
had a few too many that night as well and fell on his can at the beginning of the second
song, “Black Gold.” It was funny for so many reasons. Besides “Somebody to Shove,” (the one Johnboy & Billy play)
the new album Grave Dancers Union is a good one. It’s a little on the slow side for Soul Asylum
but every song on the disc is worth listening to. If you are going to buy one of their albums,
get And the Horse They Rode In On, the one previous to Grave Dancers Union. It is probably in my
top three albums EVER.

The big shift from Seattle has begun. Cities like Minneapolis and New York are once again seizing the reins of
underground music. It’s hard for me to honk the horn for bands like Husker Du and Soul Asylum without being
slightly proud of my current home state. And you thought nothing good ever came out of Minnesota! We’ve got 10,000
lakes and at least two bands that are worth a damn.English major. Loaded Weapon 1 (PG 13) 9:10 only Untamed
