**Musical cast finds success, hard work**

The glitter, the laughs, the fun, and the fantasy of last week's "Anything Goes" performances are over. The performances, which
had Davidson College people, the Davidson community, and others enthralled, laughing, and tapping their way out of the theater, ended
with a climactical performance for the cast Saturday evening. The set was dismantled by 2:00 a.m. Sunday.

"It's best that way (taking the set down that night)...there is no use for it anymore," Set Designer Joseph Gardner
commented, "you sort of get used to it." He had spent over a month designing the complex and movable set
with rotating rooms. Gardner also was Costume Designer.

Several of the veteran actors and actresses commented that it was important to forget the fantasy and play; remembering it
as a chapter in their lives and going on to other activities. Monday, the set was gone and only a
few remnants of the stage decor were noticed backstage. Janitors were sweeping the aisle ways in preparation for a Tuesday
musical performance.

Aside from the consummate and complex set, the casting and direction of the musical was a demanding job in itself.
Both Gardner and Director Dr. Rupert T. Barber Jr., as well as many members of the cast, expressed that physical
and emotional exhaustion prevailed at times in preparation for the five performances. The dancers, who had long, concentrated rehearsals, were
affected considerably. Most had no prior experience dancing. Many of the students involved have had some academic problems because of
the time demand of the play.

**Cast selection**
Auditioning began, unusually, prior to spring term at the end of winter term. 78 persons applied for parts in the
cast and in a three-part, three-sitting weeding process, the final cast of 32 members was selected. There were approximately 100
persons involved in the whole production. The three parts included reading on stage for Barber, singing for the play’s Musical
Director Michael Pittard, and dancing under the scrutiny of Choreographer Linda Mallonee and Musical Stager Nancy Gardner, the latter judging
a person’s ability to learn a dance step.

The schedule for the play started after spring break with reading through the play, then the cast began mastering their
movements on stage, and finally the dress rehearsals. All the while the “acting” segment is working, Pittard, Mallonee, and Gardner
were working individually with the singing and dance numbers. Ellen Schlaefer, who played Mrs. Harcourt, Steve Pharr, who played Billy
Crocker, and Alison Peeler, who played Virtue, one of the Angels, had either leg or foot problems during rehearsals. This
made the preparation challenging.All the more difficult. Backstage during the performances, what with stage crew and make-up people, the scene
was often hectic. Many costume and footwear changes on the part of the major roles, including the sailors, had to
be made with the stage crew “staying way out of the way,” according to one of the crew members. While
designing the set, Gardner had to consider constantly the limited space on the stage in light of a relatively large
cast. The cast would show up by 6:30 for an 8:15 showing in order to be made-up in the small
make-up room. This was partly due to necessity and partly due to the cast not wanting to be harried before
show time, according to Hal McCoy, who is now also known as Moonface Martin, public enemy no. 13.

Barber is known by the cast as not only an excellent and personable director but an educational one as well.
He gave the responsibility of developing the role to the given cast member, according to Reno Sweeney’s role player Patricia
Arnold, Pharr, and McCoy. Alterations, corrections, and changes were later made in collaboration with him. This gives the cast member
an opportunity to struggle with her or his part and hopefully learn a little about themselves as well as the
character. One of Barber’s commitments in drama is its educational rewards for the cast, crew, and audience. Some of the
cast members developed their characters by adding what are known as bits or business, little actions that are not necessarily
called for in the script but add to the role, as late as the opening night. “This is what we
were hoping for,” Gardner said. “We have had an ambitious year,” he asserted concerning the three major productions this year.
They all involved a large cast and a great deal of time and commitment on the part of the students.

Last musical
The last musical the department produced was “Oh What A Lovely War” written by a British acting ensemble. The Davidson
production was in 1969. Both Gardner and Barber expressed skepticism about another musical for next year. The work and demands
on all involved would be too great for a musical two years in a row.

This rendition of “Anything Goes” was a re-hash of the original production of 1934. At that time, the format, which
included a shipwreck, had to be changed due to the sinking of a real ocean liner. It was then altered
to generally the same plot as the one just performed. In 1962, a group of people wanting to make the
epitome of the Cole Porter musical added a number of his songs, pulled a few, and changed the script to
incorporate the new Porter hits.

The play has ended. Those who worked long and hard to pull off a tight and professional show now move
on to other shows and projects, and we have Cole Porter’s “Anything Goes” to hum for who knows how long.
“Shows have to end,” concluded McCoy.
