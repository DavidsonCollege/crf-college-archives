**Five Sick After FIJI Bash**

Five Davidson students had one too many shots of tequila at the “Hit Me with Your Best Shot” party at the Fiji House on Friday night, 1 October, and wound up in the infirmary. A friend of one fraternity member that went to the infirmary said, “We were worried about him; his breathing seemed shallow.” The party consisted of shots of tequila, bourbon, and Schnapps, ordered by one student and sent to another via sparsely clad waitresses who would not disclose the sender’s identity. Even though some people couldn’t hold their liquor, most people had a good time. Says one freshman: “It was the best party I’ve ever been to.”

**Colleges Increase Suspensions**

CPS—Colleges and universities are getting much tougher on misbehaving students, according to a study just released by the University of Maryland. The study shows that administrators are suspending 40 percent more students per year than they used to, are tightening disciplinary procedures, and making it easier to bring students before disciplinary boards. Based on a random survey of some 150 colleges, the study says 7.8 students per campus were suspended during the 1980-81 school year, compared to 5.5 students in 1979-80. There was also “a clear trend to increase the severity of sanctions” against students, says Dr. Scott Rickard, vice chancellor of student affairs at the University of Maryland-Baltimore and director of the survey. “Our research,” he adds, “indicates that administrators think there are too many procedural rules” protecting students against disciplinary sanctions. “During the decade of the seventies, student due-process provisions were implemented extensively.” Student Affairs officers told Rickard’s researchers that the rules had become “overly legalistic, cumbersome, and too technical.” As a result, “many campuses are examining this so it is quicker, simpler, and more accountable,” Rickard summarizes. “They clearly want to maintain the necessary due-process rules to protect student rights, but many campuses feel it’s gone beyond what’s necessary.” The increase in the number of suspensions may, in addition to the effects of easier disciplinary procedures, be due to more violence on campus. The survey found the number of physical assault cases among students increased by 75 percent between 1979-80 and 1980-81.

**WDAV’s Clark to Tour German Broadcasting Centers**

CREE—WDAV station manager John Clark is participating in a study tour of the principal broadcasting centers in West Germany, sponsored by the Goethe Institute, the cultural arm of the Federal Republic of Germany. Clark is one of 12 American specialists in the field of public radio invited to take part in the tour. The group’s itinerary includes stops in Berlin, Munich, and Cologne. In addition to visiting and learning about West Germany’s radio broadcasting system, Clark will study arts feature production techniques and view the rehearsal recording of a Berlin Philharmonic concert. “I am especially pleased to have the chance to see their approach to radio recording and production, because WDAV is actively involved in recording local and regional concerts and producing programming to promote the arts locally,” Clark said. Clark joined WDAV in March 1981, after serving as director of promotion and development for KPBS radio in San Diego. He previously served as director of field services for FOUNT (Friends of University Network Television) in Chapel Hill, and as an announcer and programmer at WUNC radio in Chapel Hill. He also has worked with commercial radio.stations in Chapel Hill, Raleigh, and Elizabethtown, N.C.

College Computer Adds Memory

The Davidson College Computer Services Center added 0.5 megabytes (500,000 units of memory) to each of its Prime computers this summer. The Prime 750 now has two megabytes, and the Information System has 1.5 megabytes of memory. The new memory is called ECC memory (Error Correction Code), and the computer uses it to handle instructions that people transmit through terminals. ECC memory contrasts with disk memory, which stores files (programs, text, data) for prolonged periods. The addition of ECC memory will help the computers manage more operations than they have in the past.

On an expansion drive, those members sent out flyers announcing an EMT course to be taught on campus by the Central Piedmont Community College. Fifteen to twenty students completed the course, which met for three hours a night, two nights a week throughout winter term, and ended with the EMT exam. Hopkins states that the service hopes to be able to sponsor the EMT course again this winter, open to all students, whether interested in joining the service or not. He also emphasizes the fact that the ERS is competent and willing to help. In his words, “We’re here to serve the campus in whatever way we can.”

Spencer Attends Fulbright Anniversary

ENT to Certify Emergency Medical Technicians

Junior Bob Hopkins, a member of the all-volunteer Davidson Emergency Rescue Service, describes his group’s work as ranging “from CPR to childbirth.” Started in 1978, the ERS is composed of eighteen students trained and certified as Emergency Medical Technicians. Their system functions as follows: both a registered nurse at the College Infirmary and one pair of EMTs are on duty at all times. The nurse mans the emergency telephone number (892-3031) and relays any message to the EMTs on duty by means of a radio communications system. Receiving the information on their beepers, the two rush directly to the scene in an automobile which contains the necessary equipment usually carried on an ambulance. This year the ERS is headed by chief Lisa Young; its current membership of eighteen students grew from four during winter term last year.

College President Dr. Samuel Spencer attended the 30th anniversary celebration of the Fulbright Scholarship program in Germany at the Rheinisch Friedrich Wilhelm University in Bonn on Monday, 4 October. Spencer was one of six program participants at an academic convocation in the morning, followed by a reception and luncheon hosted by the German Foreign Office. In connection with the event, Spencer also attended a reception for Senator Fulbright, hosted by U.S. Ambassador Arthur F. Burns, and a dinner for American Fulbright professors. Senator J. William Fulbright, for whom the scholarship program is named, also took part in the event. Fulbright served as U.S. Senator from Arkansas during the years 1945-74, achieving a reputation as the most influential legislator ever in the field of foreign relations. Spencer currently serves as chairman of the Board of Foreign Scholarships, the agency that oversees the Fulbright program and other U.S. international exchange programs. He has been a strong supporter of international studies and international exchange programs. Spencer took time during his trip to visit some 17 Davidson students who are studying this year at the Phillips-University in Marburg, West Germany.
