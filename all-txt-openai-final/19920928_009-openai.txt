**Tony Tunasit: "Could You Speak English?"**

I was hanging upside down on the Jungle Gym with my best friend Danny discussing the pros and cons of Big Bird for President, when suddenly Dana walked by and shot a loogie at me. Immediately, I knew that Dana DeRussy, the class cubbie monitor, the cutest girl with no front teeth, and the coolest freckles in kindergarten, was going to be the mother of my twelve children. So, I did what every five-year-old guy has done when he’s in love:

DANA: Mrs. Kubicki, Tony pulled my hair again!!!

Life used to be so simple. Only yesterday, the woman of your dreams was that little girl who tagged you during “Duck, duck, goose.” Or you could find out if a girl liked you by using one of these neat devices:

~ Mary Lou, do you like me? (Please check which applies)
— Yes.
— No.
— Maybe.
— Try again when you’re taller.

Now, men and women are playing subversive mind games. We emit mixed signals, no signals, telepathic signals, and morse code signals. I think men and women just don’t speak the same language. I overheard the following conversation at First Rich the other day:

SHARON: What did he say about what she told him about that incident he had?
SCARLET: Well, he said that she wanted him to tell her that he said he wanted him to tell her that he how.
SHARON: Really?!
SCARLET: Yeah and he said cof! HeB2TM Goof f™M j. |,

Perhaps women use an intrinsic code which we men must somehow try to interpret and understand. I know that the guy that wrote the book "How to Understand Women and Fix a Standard Butterfly Valve Carburetor" is bloody rich.

Women apparently have the same problem understanding men. Take, for example, the following headline I happened to see on the cover of “Teen” Magazine: “3,200 Guys Give the Inside Dirt on Dating, Relationships and DEION SANDERS, ATLANTA’S SUPERMAN?!!” Yes, the language of man includes philosophy, religion, literature, and the sciences and mathematics, which are all neatly packaged in the latest Baseball Weekly. (Check out the neat picture of Kenny Lofton sliding head first into John Olerud’s spikes!!)

Women are learning, though. I actually heard the following conversation in the Union:

SAMANTHA: Um, so you’re in Williamson, right?
PATRICK: Yeah. You’ve got Kimmel, right?
SAMANTHA: Huh? Yeah. So, uh, have you been to the Union Outpost yet?
PATRICK: Uh, no.
SAMANTHA: Did you know that the Braves won?
PATRICK: The BRAVES WON?!!! Really!! Oh shoot! Gosh, that means they’re eight... Um, Samantha, will you marry me?!!!

As you can clearly see, the women have a clear advantage over men. They have learned after many years of Monday Night Football, the World Series, The NBA Finals, and Billy Joe’s Rabid Armadillo Flickerball Tournament that the way to a man’s heart is through sports. Many men have died trying to figure out women. Always, men are left with the same question: “What do you mean you didn’t like the Standard Butterfly Valve Carburetor? I had that especially ordered.” We have yet to understand the language of women. Actually, I must confess, I know how to understand women. All you have to do is $°%t# *&AGEGE F oo*§£...

**Pithy Irreverence: What Time is it Anyway?**

Time is standing still. Can you feel it? On the clock on the wall right around the corner from Dean Terry’s office, it’s 4:25. On the nosey. Has been now for four years.

At least once a week when I’m late for class (I live in Apartment C, which is in Mooresville, so it takes a while) I overhear someone say, “Oh, good, we’ve still got five minutes.” The grandfather clock at the top of the stairs in the library reads 8:11, and probably has now for decades.

Now, before you call these timepieces useless, consider the positive: they are right twice a day. The lights have gone out behind those cool Back-to-the-Future-esque clocks on each end of Chambers. And what’s the deal with that bell on top of Perkins? Why does it always toll out 43 o’clock? How are the powers-that-be supposed to run a college when they can’t even keep the clocks on time?

I don’t think it’s negligence. Obviously, there’s a conspiracy going on here. The people who own and operate the clocks are just letting them run down, hoping we won’t notice, and soon everything and everyone will be thrown into a state of utter confusion. The Union will start being open at totally irrational and inconvenient times. Classes will be scheduled for “whenever-the-hell-you-get-there.” No one will be able to tell if their Domino’s is $3 off or not. People will get confused as to when what comes on CNN. As you see, Chaos. Total Chaos. This is not the way for the #18 liberal arts school in the nation to be run. Change must come now, before it’s too late. Before we all lose track, (there’s only so long you can use that old “one one-thousand, two one-thousand” trick) and the administration forms a special committee to determine, without bias, of course, what time it is. Then they’ll have us.

But the problem is that people already don’t really know what time it is. Either that, or they don’t care, which is worse. And with Spike Lee coming soon, too.

RIIIING! BZZZZ! BEEEP! “Wake up!”

similarity. “Guess you play a lotta ball, with a name like that, eh?” The joke, of course, being that mine is one of the only households in the country into which you can walk on any given New Year’s or Thanksgiving and not find a game on TV. That, along with the fact that I am the puniest and least coordinated of an already athletically inept family, would cause the ice to break alright, sending the antecedent of the utterance directly into the bone-chilling waters of my frosty (the inevitable modifier here) stare. Now that I am of a slightly more jovial sort, I simply reply, “Actually, I am a seven-foot basketball-toting drug addict, but I’m trying to keep it quiet.” It’s a bit more up, I think, but new acquaintances still find me rather odd.

Last year, things got a bit out of hand. While a senior at Davidson, I would gallivant about the greater Charlotte-Mecklenburg vicinity only to be confronted by signs bedecked with my name. Always on the hunt for fame, the notion of my full name (this time even the middle initial was meted out to us both) splashed across billboards and planted in the yards of the more politically active citizenry was by no means displeasing. I knew someone else must be running, but I did entertain a Perotvian fantasy of a grass-roots movement to propel me into office—and I liked the thought. If I hadn’t seen the candidate’s photograph in the Observer, I never would have minded the unsolicited employment of my appellation; but the guy was an absolute dweeb! Many’s the time when I have justly deserved the insulting and even obscene participles which have so often preceded my surname, but this guy cleaned out the larder and rummaged through the garage while taking the proverbial cake. After several costly therapy sessions for which I am still trying to have this policy wonk billed, I managed to get over my dismay; that is, until last week.

Upon a brief visit to my beloved alma mater it was brought to my attention that there is a member of the class of '96 who also carries my name. I had never felt so betrayed by an admissions office. Sure, I hadn’t exactly done enough on campus to have my name retired, but they could have at least waited a term or two. I worried immediately what this fellow’s having my name would do to my reputation at school, but several of my old friends told me to rest easy. “Don’t worry,” they said in their ever-supportive tones, “he’s cooler than you.” Having met him myself during my visit, I see that they’re right. Now I am left only with fears of what a hindrance his name will be for him at Davidson. Have my former fraternity brothers castigated the poor soul for fear of not making the same mistake twice? Have any of Davidson’s absent-minded professors advised him against taking their classes fearing that he, too, might be prone to skipping the reading and babbling nonsensically in class? Have my creditors caught up with him yet? Probably not. In fact, my thinking that my fellow students and teachers have even remembered me at all to this young man can only be called wishful at best. If anything, one or two fifth-year seniors may have seen his name in the meat book and said something to the effect of “wasn’t there some... nah.”

Learning that you’re last year’s model is a painful experience indeed, but it’s also, I think, a necessary one. As a youth freshly entering the world, one must put behind him the days of his past, and with the chisel of his character carve into the granite of the world a name for himself. Phooey. I'll just get some spray paint.

Sincerely,
David Thompson

obvious that the writer of the article has some type of animosity for the football team. As I read the article I felt as if I was reading a school newspaper from Rhodes College, based upon the way the article seemed to gloat about our defeat. Even in my state of extreme agitation, I decided to give the writer of the article the benefit of the doubt by speaking privately with him about the article. Much to my surprise when I looked for his phone number on my official residence adviser student directory I could not even find his name, or any name even close to the fictitious “Kent Brockman.” I even called the student union and they did not have any student of such name in their directory. “Kent Brockman’s” fictitious name only confirmed for me that the mean-spirited tone of the article was intentional.

My first complaint is directed toward “Kent Brockman” for writing an article that is so destructive of team morale, and school spirit, and for not having the backbone to sign his real name to the article. My second complaint is directed toward the sports editor, Bruce Balestier, and toward the Editor in Chief, Walter Price for letting such garbage not only be published, but published anonymously. As a Davidson student-athlete I try to support all of Davidson’s athletic teams. Although it may be too much to ask the student body to have more school spirit (as evidenced by the mass departure of so many students at halftime of our football game), I do not think that it is too much to ask the sports section of our school newspaper to print articles that are at least favorable to our sports teams.
