THOMPSON TWINS: Our man on the Concert Committee reports a call from the Thompson Twins’ agent, John Huie, after the band’s show in Birmingham, England. Huie said, “Any student at Davidson College who doesn’t buy a ticket to this show ought to transfer to Dumbo Junior College. Their production is the most awesome one for a theatre venue I’ve ever seen. The Fixx’s show doesn’t come close to it.”

Since he is flying down from New York to see the concert, Huie is making a “can’t miss” deal. “I'll personally reimburse the money to anyone who feels he did not get his $5 worth,” he said. “All it will take is a written statement.”

Already the Thompson Twins have sold out shows in New York and Detroit, and the L.A. show, which is two months away, has sold 6,000 tickets. The Union still has a few tickets left for the Davidson show. “Hey,” says impresario Scott Huie, “the Twins are happening.”
