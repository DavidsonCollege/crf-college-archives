UT-C ends ’Cats’ season

By MEGHAN CURTISS

The volleyball team ended its season with a loss to the Chattanooga Lady Mocs in the SoCon Tournament in Statesboro, Ga. This defeat closed out a disappointing record of 15-18 for the Wildcats.

The ’Cats started out strong, winning two of the first three games, 30-24, 23-30, 30-26. Chattanooga then took over the play, winning the last two games 30-32 and 10-15.

In the first game, All-SoCon second-team member Liz Williamson ’07 put the Wildcats in the lead with her 19th kill of the match. Chattanooga then pulled ahead 10-9, but the ’Cats made another comeback when Katie Pierucci ’08 made her 18th kill of the match. Even after this surge, the Lady Mocs made another comeback with a 5-0 sweep to take the match.

Other Wildcat standouts include Lindsey Woeste ’08, who made 27 digs in game three, just one dig off of her career high. Pierucci not only made it to double digits in her kills in game two, but also contributed four kills and five digs to the win in game one.

Game four was closely fought, but Chattanooga ended up gaining the momentum and pulling out a 32-30 win. The game opened up in an 11-11 tie, with each team gaining and losing points up to a 30-30 tie, when the Lady Mocs were able to win the last two points.

Game four highlights include Kittery Neale’s (’09) career-high attempts with 45, three digs, and her team-high four blocks.

“Kittery played awesome which was very exciting. She is working hard, and she will soon make herself a dominant middle in our conference which means great things for our team,” said Jenna Dykstra ’07.

Williamson contributed with 10 digs, while Pierucci made 17. Dykstra also contributed a match-high 63 assists. As a team, the ’Cats tied a season-high 100 attacks.

“Our last game was very disappointing. We worked hard to get ourselves in a position to win the match and advance in the tournament but we let it slip away,” said Dykstra. “We played all season to be in a match like that, but unfortunately it got away from us.”

On a personal note, the match was the last for Erin Balak ’06. She finishes her noteworthy career in Davidson’s top-10 in games played, with 466, and matches played, with 131. In addition, Williamson was named to the SoCon All-Conference Second Team, marking the ninth time a Davidson player has been given the first or second team honors.

Said Pierucci, “It was close all the way to the end. Our statistics didn’t indicate that we played poorly, and it’s difficult to find something technical to blame for the loss. Despite our disappointment, we displayed a lot of talent and potential this season and next year’s outlook is very promising.”
