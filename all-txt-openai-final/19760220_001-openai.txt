**Committee presents budget, cites four income sources**

The faculty Budget, Buildings, and Grounds Committee presented the tentative college budget for 1976-1977 at an open meeting in Perkins Auditorium last Wednesday. College President Samuel R. Spencer, Jr. opened the meeting with some remarks on the sources of increased expenses and revenues for next year. Spencer explained the changes as increased costs of necessities, increases in salaries and wages, and increases requested by the various departments of the college.

Spencer cited four general sources of augmenting the college’s income. “The income for the endowment next year is down. We actually have more than $1 million more in endowment, but because we operate on a three-year rolling average for endowment income, income will be down,” said Spencer. “There has been a small increase in gifts and trusts. We feel that we have about reached the limit on adding additional students. That only leaves increased student fees. We are checked here by a desire not to price ourselves out of the market,” he continued.

Spencer indicated that the college had enough additional income to cover the increases in the cost of necessities and wage and salary increases, but not the requested increases for the college departments. “That’s what this budget has done. We have had to cut out the requested additions in most cases,” said Spencer.

College Comptroller Robert W. Davidson then presented the budget. He explained how the committee had estimated the income the college would receive next year. Davidson emphasized that this was only a tentative budget and would remain so until the Trustees act on it later this month. “We went through the exercise of trying to estimate our income from all students. Our estimate is based on a projected increase in tuition of $200 and a rise in enrollment of 15 students. For our endowment income, we operate on the total returns principle. We take the market value of all our securities for the last three years and average them. We guarantee ourselves five percent of this as income,” said Davidson.

A question arose as to how much money had been allocated for psychological counseling. Dean of Students Will H. Terry answered, saying that the salary for one of the counselors now comes from faculty salaries. That particular counselor will be leaving after Fall term next year. “Actually, the same amount of money has been allocated for the counselors. We will not, however, have the extra money from faculty salaries after Fall term. I am going to try and manipulate the budget in order to keep the five full days of counseling which we have this year,” said Terry.

Spencer answered a question on the status of the Office for Experiential Learning. “Next year is the first year that the college will have to bear the full burden of the program. Up to now, the office has been funded from a HEW grant. Approximately $3,000 was cut from the Experiential Learning budget.”

The meeting ended with a discussion of faculty salary increases. Davidson said that any faculty salary increases would come out of the $240,580 excess of income over expenditures projected for next year. Professor of Philosophy John J. Young asked if the whole $240,580 figure would go to such salary increases. Davidson replied that it would not.

Former SGA President John Munce offered some general comments on the budget meeting. “One needed a more than average familiarity with not only the operation of the budget process but also the operation of the college to be able to get anything from the budget figures,” he said.

The Preyer Infirmary is understaffed, obsolete, and under-funded, according to Head Nurse Dorothy Sherrill and Dean of Students Will H. Terry. Few measures have been taken to remedy the situation.

The first area of need is equipmental. The insufficient heating facilities create discomfort for both patients and nurses. In order to heat the men’s ward adequately, the women’s ward upstairs and the front rooms on the ground floor become unbearably hot. Sherrill feels that each room should, ideally, contain its own electric heating system so that the temperature in each room could be controlled separately. Director of the Physical Plant Grover C. Meetze Jr. indicated concern over the situation and is taking steps to initiate short-term repairs. Meetze commented that “The main thing to consider is what’s going to be the operation of the place in the next five years.”

The College does not yet know whether or not the infirmary will be relocated, whether or not its parking situation will be improved, or whether or not the Town of Davidson will involve itself with the infirmary. “It’s easy to renovate the building as it is,” said Meetze, “but since the situation is going to be changed it would be a waste of money for short-run renovation.”

The infirmary is also in need of a part-time custodian. At the moment, any cleaning-up must be done by the nurses. Sherrill added that when the infirmary was built the college saw the need for a janitor. At that time the college enrolled five hundred students. Now, with an enrollment of 1200, there is no janitor in the infirmary.

The infirmary presently employs three full-time nurses and one part-time nurse. In order to allow them all to receive one full day off, they must put in 12-hour shifts. Terry does not see the adding of another nurse as realistic in the near future. Because there is normally only one nurse on duty, who must remain with patients, prescriptions sometimes must wait to be filled. Mail services are delayed; throat cultures taken on one day, for instance, cannot be sent out until the next.

Other equipmental deficiencies cannot be taken care of so easily due to the uncertain future of the present infirmary. The beds are ancient and uncomfortable, according to students. The bell service in the men’s ward is wearing down and there are no working televisions or other recreational facilities. Both cooks and nurses expressed the need for a dumbwaiter or elevator to transport both food and patients to the second floor. The doctors have expressed a need for a microscope as one of the primary medical supplies. “Generally, everything is obsolete,” said Sherrill. These deficiencies cannot be solved until the infirmary is out of its period of transition.

Since errands and emergencies occur only occasionally, it is unfeasible to hire a full-time errand boy. Terry feels that a volunteer service consisting of students willing to run errands should be created. Sherrill indicated that a list of those students and their telephone numbers would enable nurses to contact available help when necessary. Terry recommended that this same group form a shuttle service to solve the problem of transportation. Many students do not have access to transportation and need it in cases such as high fevers and broken legs, when it is unfeasible for them to walk to the infirmary.

The physicians themselves add to the infirmary problems. Students are not able to see the same doctor twice and occasionally complain that those they do see do not examine them. Doctor Elethorpe has been working four days a week since Christmas, however. This alleviates some of the problem.

A major barrier facing renovation is funding. According to Terry, the money will be a Capital Funds Item. “As I understand it, we will have to go outside the college for funding,” he said.
