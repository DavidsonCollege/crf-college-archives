The Davidson men’s tennis team finished up its successful conference season with a record of 22-5, the team’s best since 1978. It was Coach Jeff Frank’s third-best finish in his eight-year tenure at Davidson. The Wildcats finished up 6-1 in the Southern Conference, losing only to Furman. They had one more game to complete against Appalachian State yesterday before the tournament began, since the Davidson-ASU match at Boone was rained out with the score tied at 3-3.

“I’m really happy with our record,” Frank said. “It’s outstanding. I think the individual records are super.” Frank noted that the five top players had each won 20 matches or more. “I think that’s pretty incredible consistency.”

The Southern Conference tournament began today. Frank predicted that Furman and UT-Chattanooga would be the strongest teams; however, he added, “Our guys’ records are so good, and our confidence is such that, on any given day, we could come up winners.” Frank expects his seniors, who have led the team all season, to perform well in the tournament. “I think I would expect Jay (Gepfert) to turn it loose.” Frank also said junior Nevins Todd would be a “tough competitor,” whose conference record leads the team going into the tournament.

No matter how the Wildcats fare in the conference tournament, Frank has been pleased with the performance of his team this season. “We are really good this year, maybe even a little bit better than I thought we would be at the beginning of the season. It was just a tremendous year,” Frank said.

The women’s tennis team finished the regular season Tuesday with an outstanding team record of 16-2. Junior Emmy Knobloch, in the number one singles position, remained undefeated in 18 matches.

On April 7, the Cats defeated Guilford College 7-2. Last year Davidson and Guilford had tied for second place in the state tournament. Coach Pat Miller said that this year’s match was “the best match we played as a whole team.” Davidson won all six singles matches. The number-three doubles team, junior Adelaide Wilcox and sophomore Catherine Smith, lost for the first time at the hands of Guilford. Despite their loss, Wilcox and Smith still hold the team’s best doubles record.

On April 13, the lady netters shut out Pfeiffer College 9-0. On April 14, the Cats fell to Appalachian State University 3-6. Knobloch was the sole singles winner against Appalachian. Wins in the first and third doubles positions rounded out the score.

This week, the Cats finished the season with two strong victories, defeating UNCC Monday and Presbyterian College Tuesday. The score in both matches was 6-3.

Yesterday the team left for Greensboro to compete in the North Carolina Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (NCAIW) state tournament. Miller said that undefeated High Point College is the favored team, but Davidson and Guilford stand close behind in the ratings.

Staff WriterDavidson track team finished the regular season with an eight-team meet at Appalachian State University last weekend. Davidson tied for third place with Milligan, finishing behind ASU and Liberty Baptist College. Senior captain Dick Jones won the 400 meter intermediate hurdles with a new school record of 52.5 seconds and also placed fourth in the 110 meter high hurdles. Junior Randy McManus finished second in the 1500 meter run and fourth in the 5000 meter. Senior John Davis placed fourth in the 10,000 meter run and freshman Clark Carter tied for fourth in the pole vault.

The culmination of the season is the Southern Conference meet which will be held at Davidson this Friday and Saturday. Jones’ personal best of 52.5 seconds is the second fastest time in the conference next to that of Bob McKay of East Tennessee State University, who has clocked a 51.46. If McKay and Jones meet in the finals of the 400 meter intermediate hurdles, it should be one of the most exciting races of the meet. Jones needs to shave 0.7 seconds off of his time to secure a trip to the NCAA Track and Field Championships.

Davidson is also expecting to place many team members on the All-Southern Conference team, as the top three finishers in each event are named to the team. Senior John Davis in the 3000 meter steeplechase, junior Randy McManus in the 5000 meter run, and junior Gifford Piercy in the long jump are top contenders in the conference in their events. Davidson students will have the opportunity to watch some of the best runners in the country compete in the Southern Conference meet this weekend, and may see some Davidson athletes qualify for the National Championships and the All-Southern Conference team.
