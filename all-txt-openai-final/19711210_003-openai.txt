**Senate Denies Brown Funds**

The Student Senate voted 10-9 Tuesday night to refuse to appropriate seventeen dollars and fifty cents to the newly organized
Brown Student Coalition. Mark Meza, spokesman for the brown student group, expressed his “deepest disappointment” that the senate had failed
to meet his requests. Meza said that the money would have been used for “organizational purposes.”

The brown student group is composed of those Davidson students of Mexican, Spanish-American, and Latin American backgrounds. Meza told the
senate that the Brown Student Coalition, like its predecessor, the Black Student Coalition, would offer a sense of pride and
unity to its members, and would present to the whole campus a new cultural perspective. Also, Meza pointed out, such
an organization would help in the recruiting of future brown students.

Cecil Burney, a senior class senator, protested that to grant the brown students money would “open the floodgates to every
Tom, Dick, and Carlos that wanted us to appropriate their pet project.” Doug Brown, an active member of the black
student group and a sophomore senator, presented three compromising amendments to Meza’s proposal, all of which were defeated. One of
the amendments was voted on three times after a confusion developed when sophomore class president Bill Ralston attempted to discern
the nature of the action.

In the final voting on the proposal, several votes were again necessary as junior senator Ralph Peeples refused to vote
until after SGA vice-president Bill Alexander.

In other senate action, freshman class president Steve Canterbury moved that all members of his class be allowed to wear
beanies. “Such an expression of class unity would be beneficial and helpful,” he asserted. David Forester, a freshman dorm senator,
seconded Canterbury’s proposal with a lengthy speech that SGA president Danny Clodfelter finally ruled out of order. In the ensuing
heated discussion, it became obvious that the freshman senators had formed a powerful block. Finally, Burney, a leading opponent of
the bill, relented, saying that the senate should “let the freshmen have their beanies.”

**Independents End Nat'l. Affiliation**

In a surprise move, the independents voted to go local and end their national affiliation in a meeting Tuesday night.
The vote caused a certain amount of controversy as many independents had not been advised of the meeting and did
not vote. Senior Todd Hobbie said, “I was not advised of the meeting and did not vote.”

The decision is expected to count as a major victory for the new social system implemented in the last year
and a half under the leadership of Dean Will Terry. The economic problem of national dues was the chief factor
in the decision.

**Library Decision Reversed Again**

The proposed E. H. Little Library changed looks and location again this week when the trustee executive committee reversed their
earlier decisions. One member of the committee, who asked that his name be withheld for political reasons, said that the
committee had reconsidered their latest decision and had decided to stick to the original drawings of the facade.

“We felt, upon reflection, that we had been railroaded into the decision to redesign the facade of the building,” he
said. “Once the public browbeating was over several of the committeemen decided they really did like the original plan.” The
member dismissed charges from critics of the design, both faculty and students. In particular, he said that Larry Ligo, instructor
of art, was out of line in criticizing the aesthetics of the building. “I may not know art, but I
know what I like,” he said. “It’s preposterous to say that the library looks like a Velveeta cheese box with
pencils glued on the front.”

The controversial decision to tear down the college union to make way for the new structure was also rescinded. “The
committee decided that the union was really too valuable in this period of the new social system,” the member said.
“We’re considering several locations, including Richardson Field, the site across Concord Road, and the location behind the president’s house. We
expect that this year’s freshmen will be studying in the new library by the time they graduate.” Architects indicated that
they expected construction to begin as early as February of 1975.Fools wear the damn things if they want. I’ve only
got six months left here.” Burney’s remarks were echoed by cries of “right on” by senior dorm senator Danny Berry.
In the final significant action of the night, the senate considered the controversial question of the necessity of its re-chartering
by college president Samuel R. Spencer. Clodfelter related to the senate the urgency of the matter, and the senators responded
immediately. While Ralston questioned the nature of the issue, Meza articulated his belief that any such elitist government should not
exist, and the SGA should not try to be rechartered. Burney stated that since the senate did nothing anyway, such
a discussion was irrelevant, as was the issue.

(Editor's Note: Since there has been virtually no progress on the radio station since 1968, THE DAVIDSONIAN is partially reprinting
the following article from the January 30, 1970 issue from January 10, 1969 issue so that we may keep up
with our tradition of scooping only the latest news.)

Back in ’68 sophomore disk jockey Ed Dobbs is reputed to have said that the only thing holding up the
station “is its receiving a permit from the FCC.” Dobbs, who is now busy producing The Archies' latest hit, “Farm
Out” on the Sugar Pops label, reaffirmed his belief that the station would be momentarily back on the air. “It
is just a temporary bureaucratic tie-up that the FCC should straighten out any time now. Those of you who miss
those highly stimulating, controversial editorials, will not have to wait much longer, as WDAV will soon return to the air,
lambasting everyone in sight,” Dobbs said.

Scott Keeter, who has done all of WDAV’s recent AM broadcasting, said that he would go right on producing the
underground WDAV sound on his genuine 5 megacycle Mickey Mouse transmitter, equipped, he noted, to transmit the latest in quadraphonic
sound. A special 5-second memorial presentation will also be aired, honoring former editorialist ICE PRICE.
