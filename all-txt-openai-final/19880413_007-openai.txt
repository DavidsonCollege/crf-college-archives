The Davidsonian

Footprints in the Sand

—Dedicated to my Martha, Spring ’86

You and I will always wade hand
in hand amidst the rolling tide
and shifting sands

Seagulls will wing constantly over
oncoming waters from distant
lands

The image of a cascading rainbow
cannot be compared to my
visions of you

Our love will live forever in the
sandcastles we build beyond
the limits of the salty blue

We compliment each other much
like a fiery horizon as it creates
a crystal sea

Oh how wonderful life is—
when your light shines within
me...

-Ara Thad Ayer '91

I will kiss the dust off my fins and break glass to be
pelagic with you, o fish.
