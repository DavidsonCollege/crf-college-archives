**Everest climber speaks**

This past Monday, Andrew Harvard, lawyer and veteran mountain climber, spoke on his two attempts on the previously “impossible” east face of Mt. Everest: the 1981 attempt which got close yet ended in failure, and the successful 1983 attempt. Five points came into view for the successful ascent: right people, maximization of human potential, clearly defined success, focus on essentials, and choice of the right leader, a leader who is first among equals. Those climbers that are firstly glory seekers need not apply, Harvard said.

Andrew Harvard gave his talk at 7:30 p.m. in the Chambers Gallery on April 21. Dean T.C. Price Zimmermann, who has been involved with the American Alpine Club, was instrumental in bringing him here. Currently, Andrew Harvard is writing a book on the 1983 expedition.

**Physician speaks on AIDS**

W.T. Williams, one of the College Physicians, spoke on Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) at the open luncheon on Wednesday, April 23. Williams said AIDS is an acquired disease because initially persons were not born with it. The AIDS virus itself affects the immune system. According to Williams, “It blocks all reactions that take care of other viruses and fungi.”

Williams maintained that there have been 18,000 total cases of AIDS viruses reported. Ninety percent of these victims are between the ages of 20-50 years old. Seventy-three percent of the victims are homosexual or bisexual and seventeen percent are IV drug users. There is a fifty-one percent mortality rate. According to Williams, there is currently no cure for the AIDS virus. The other complications that come with the virus can be treated with antibiotics. The best way to prevent further spread is to practice safe sex and to screen blood to be donated. Persons diagnosed as having the virus should avoid pregnancy, take precautions with sex, and also avoid donating blood.

When asked if Davidson should screen applicants, Williams said the disease, “would have to be more prevalent, and spread by other means.” He indicated that such policy would come from the reaction of faculty, students, and parents to the AIDS scare.

**Honor Code open discussion held**

Monday night, an open discussion concerning the Honor Code and the Code of Responsibility was held. The discussion focused on the “fine line” between the Honor Code and Code of Responsibility. Former Honor Council member senior Sara Beasley, Honor Council Chairman junior Michael Holt, and Honor Council Secretary junior Eric Strother responded to questions from students and faculty. Holt explained that our Code of Responsibility does give us a degree of freedom and that, “Yes, there is a fine line where you are going to be violating the Code of Responsibility.” Professor John Kelton said that there is a “difference between students being honor-bound to report for Honor Code and students being obliged to report rules that they did not make themselves, like drinking.”and pets. That’s why you aren’t honor bound to report drinking because the students won't and the Honor Code won't work.” Some felt that the question of intent should be the deciding factor in cases. Holt said, “We are not cold. We look at what's best for the person and the community.”

Lambert wins prestigious Vereen Bell Award
By LAURIE BALLENGER

Senior Anne Lambert won the Vereen Bell creative writing award at Spring Convocation last Friday for two short stories entitled “Violations” and “I Should Not Tell You This.” Author William Styron judged and presented the award. Seniors Christi Baggett, Sayres Rudy, and Joan Horn received second through fourth places. English professor Dr. Tony Abbott stated that out of the 26 entries received, the English department chose 16 to send to Styron, most noted for his novel Sophie's Choice, for judging.

The Vereen Bell Fund is supported by friends of Bell '32, who was killed in World War II during the second battle of the Philippines. Bell was already a successful young professional writer, having published several stories in the Saturday Evening Post in addition to writing a novel, Swamp Water.

In the first story Lambert drew on her experiences in living in Washington this past summer. “One night a bat flew into our apartment and we were terrified. Although the situation was humorous I transformed the humor into horror in the short story.” “Violations” recounts a woman's feeling of being dominated and controlled by other people and her surroundings. Her rebellion against helplessness culminates in her confrontation with the invading bat. By killing the immediate threat she begins to obtain the independence she so desperately desires. Lambert expressed the belief that although the story is not overtly feminist, it has subtle feminist undertones.

“I Should Not Tell You This” concerns an illicit relationship between a high school teacher and a senior student. The dual narrative shows first the teacher's point of view and then the viewpoint of the boy. Lambert again depicts a feeling of helplessness as one is left feeling that the teacher is extremely vulnerable as the boy decides to tell someone.

Second place winner Christi Baggett's short story “Inheritance” tells of the sometimes painful and ambivalent relationship between a daughter and the father whom she dislikes but still loves. Writing because she believes that “everyone has a little something to say,” Baggett, a “huge reader” is “appreciative of the thoughts that other writers have shared.” She enjoys the challenge of words and precise expression. She often draws on her own background feeling that she “doesn’t know quite enough about anything else to write about it well.” She views writing from experience as a way to “distance oneself and see fact become fiction.”

The third place award recognized three essays by Senior Center major Sayres Rudy. “My Friends,” published recently in The Davidsonian addresses the Middle East problem and how people perceive it. A more humorous piece entitled “For the People, By the People” points out the existing American paradox that a government that grants its people the maturity to maintain a democracy simultaneously creates inane laws that imply that its people cannot protect themselves. A more serious piece, “The End of Human Instinct” expresses Rudy’s belief that man is not higher than the animals; for not only has man lost all his native instincts in the quest for “progress” but he has perpetrated cruelties that animals are incapable of. Possessing what Styron spoke of as “a nose for the absurd,” Rudy’s topics are subjects that he has investigated and feels deeply about.

Horn’s humorous “The Last Christmas at Grandma's” evolved from a personal essay for Dr. Engell’s class into a short story. This story was an attempt to order the past and contains no “big message—just personal.”

Because there was no clear-cut favorite entry for the Windley Hall freshman writing award among the nine judges, it was not given this year. The English department felt that because of the small amount of submitted entries they did not receive an accurate sample of freshman creative writing. Dr. Abbott sees this as a result of not publicizing the contest enough and says that in the future greater effort will be made in reaching freshman writers.

Abbott said that the English department only screens the applications while the judge makes the final decision. He cites maturity and experience as the reason for the large proportion of senior winners because “good writing is as much the result of personal maturity and growth as it is technical skill.”
