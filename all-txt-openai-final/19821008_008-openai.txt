“Just Like Christmas or the Fourth of July” Homecoming and the Matterhorn By Anne Lambert '86

Like flickerball season and the Jerry Lewis Telethon, it returns to haunt us year after year. Annual, perpetual, it endures
as a hallowed and misunderstood aspect of Davidson life. It is Homecoming, one of three “Big Weekends” celebrated by students,
administrators, faculty, and alumni each year at Davidson College.

As in years past, this year Homecoming is celebrated with concerts, dances, parties, and reunions throughout the entire weekend, but
as always, the really big show is the Homecoming football game. Tomorrow, October 9, the Cats go up against Guilford
College at 2:00 p.m. on Richardson Field. During halftime, the tradition of the homecoming court will continue, with representatives from
campus eating houses and fraternities vying for the honored title of Davidson College Homecoming Queen. This year the court includes:

Rebecca Bates (Pi Kappa Alpha)
Carolyn Scott (PAX)
Suzanne Hutchings (BSC)
Vickie Neale (Warner Hall)
Anne Hockett (Rusk House)
Ivy Goodman (ATO)
Melissa McKeithen (F & M)
Lauren Smith (Phi Delta Theta)
Shannon Hamilton (SPE)
Leesa McPhail (Court Council)

Following the game, receptions will be held by various Patterson Court establishments. Saturday night, the Union is sponsoring a campus-wide
dance in the Vail Commons.

While the Homecoming weekend offers activities and entertainment for the matriculating Davidson student, most agree that it primarily provides Davidson
alumni with an opportunity to return to their fondly-remembered college days. As one Davidson student wisely put it, “Homecoming is
called Homecoming because alumni come back home to Davidson.” Jamie May, Davidson’s Alumni Director, agrees with this viewpoint. “The major
event, as far as we (the Alumni Office) are concerned, is the fifth-year reunion of the class of 1977.”

The Alumni Office is organizing several class reunions and receptions and is also hosting what it considers another major activity,
the Avant Garde Reunion, reuniting Davidson College graduates who have been out for at least 50 years. The “centerpiece function”
of the Homecoming Alumni activities will be a general luncheon held in Vail Commons at noon Saturday.

To many, Homecoming is indeed a chance to return to see old friends and relive old times. They come back,
observes student Buck Bradberry, simply because “People now aren’t appreciative enough of what they have here.”

The opinions of Davidson students concerning Homecoming reflect this statement. “To be honest,” scorns one, “it’s a joke.” “The dance
is a bore,” remarked another student. “I plan to get drunk as hell.” The criticism extends to the Homecoming queen
competition as well. Remarked one blunt student, “It’s a joke.”

Many liberal arts colleges don’t believe that the homecoming court should preside over a school of higher education. Emory University,
for example, doesn’t have a homecoming queen competition of any kind. Why not? Fred Diamond, the Executive Editor of the
student newspaper, The Emory Wheel, says, “Emory’s like, different, ya’ know?” Lacking a school-supported football team, the college fraternity All-Star
team challenges Georgia Tech’s frat team to a football game for charity. Students hold volunteer fairs, parties, and various other
activities, with the proceeds going to charity.Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

ceeds going to local charities. Regardless of Davidson students’ personal convictions, Homecoming remains an admitted opportunity for socializing and entertainment.
“Sure it’s fun,” says one student. “You can go to the little parties and put on your nice, new clothes,
and listen to the funky bands — but we don’t spray paint our hair or go crazy or anything like
other colleges — it’s just a fun weekend.” President Spencer sees homecoming as “just a part of the college years
— it’s just like Christmas or the Fourth of July.” Students aren’t limited in their choices of entertainment provided as
part of Homecoming. This year the College Union is sponsoring numerous activities designed to “excite and stimulate the interested student,”
including the band Flight 108 in the 900 Room Friday and Saturday nights at 10 and 11:30. Friday afternoon the
Union Games Committee will have a Baby Station Race, and Marshall Crenshaw will appear in concert in Love Auditorium at
8:00 p.m. this evening. The concert is sponsored by the Union and advance tickets are available at the Union Box
Office for $3.00. The Pop Films committee will sponsor an all-night program of movies (Star Wars, 10, Time Bandits) from
1:00 a.m. until 5:00 a.m., or “until people get tired and leave.” Last night the Spongetones appeared in the 900
Room as part of the Union-sponsored Homecoming activities. Absent are the hoopla and fanfare and old Davidson grads who won’t
fade away, Homecoming would be just another weekend. As it is, students at least have some choice of entertainment for
the weekend. Regardless of any students' opinions or convictions, Homecoming at Davidson remains, like the Matterhorn, simply “there.”
