EDUCATION PLAN NOT APPLICABLE TO ALL INSTITUTIONS

CORVALLIS, Ore. (I.P.)—The University of Chicago’s educational plan is not applicable to many institutions of higher learning, and certainly not for state colleges and universities, according to Dr. Hoyt Trowbridge, a member of the University of Oregon English staff, who spent a year at Chicago recently.

Speaking to students on the campus of Oregon State College, Dr. Trowbridge said it is giving high quality education to a select group of students—but at an enormously high financial cost. Lower division students at the University of Chicago, he pointed out, can attend classes at will, switch sections, and get an A.B. degree at the end of their sophomore year. However, he said, such liberties didn’t mean that students there have an easy time of it. Comprehensive examinations, all of the objective type and graded by machinery, are hurdles that students have to surmount to qualify for the degree, Dr. Trowbridge explained. A student can take any of these examinations whenever he feels qualified, hence the voluntary nature of class attendance. The examinations are prepared by specialists rather than by the instructors, and are not the common true-false type.

Instructors in this lower division “college,” as it is called, also have to be able to teach the unique liberal arts and sciences courses included in the curriculum, Dr. Trowbridge continued. They are supposed to have only about 20 to 30 students per section, but students may change from one section to another at will, so some finish up with more than 100, while a less popular instructor may complete the term with a half dozen or fewer. This naturally keeps the instructors “on their toes,” the speaker said.

The “college” includes students of the last two years of high school and first two years of college. They may enter either for the two or four years. A new course for pre-law students is being given in the form of a seminar conducted jointly by the political science department staff. The main purpose of the new course is to introduce the students to research in the general field of political science and the particular fields of state government, political science, and pre-law.

The university doesn’t pretend that the bachelor of arts degree is equal to the usual one granted for four years of college work. However, it is independent enough not to care, he said. Beyond this lower division college, the university offers three additional years leading to the master's degree and beyond in various divisions, in addition to the work in the medical and other professional schools.

NEW COURSE OFFERED AT FLORIDA STATE

A new course entitled Materials and Methods in Political Science is now being offered to students at Florida State University. The course, designed for political science graduate students, seniors who are political science majors, covers parties, international relations, comparative government, and law. No textbook will be used for this four-hour course. Students will make use of the Florida State University, state, capital, and Supreme Court libraries for the material used in the course.

I have done business with Liggett & Myers for over 40 years. They buy the best crops in the house at the auctions. I am exclusively a Chesterfield smoker. I think they are the best cigarette made.
