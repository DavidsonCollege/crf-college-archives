Leper Colony Will Receive Christmas Gift Fund From ‘Y’

Korean Lepers Will Benefit From Annual Christmas Gift Fund

700 LEPERS TREATED

Dr. R. M. Wilson And Mr. J. K. Unger Direct Colony

At a meeting after chapel Monday morning it was decided by the “Y” Cabinet that the annual Christmas gift fund
should be turned over to the Biederwolf Leper Colony in Korea, which is under the direction of Dr. R. M.
Wilson and Mr. J. K. Unger, of the Presbyterian Church, U. S. The money will be used for the building
of a village within the leper colony for those who have been cured of the disease. Cured lepers are not
accepted into society, and the building of the village will enable many of them to earn their own living. It
will also enable them to enjoy family life, for the men will be allowed to take a wife and adopt
one child.

In Korea

The colony at present has seven hundred inmates, the largest mission colony of its kind in the world. It is
located on a peninsula in Southern Korea, and it is reputed to be one of the most beautiful spots in
the world. It is almost completely self-supporting as the inmates grow crops and catch fish. On one side is a
beautiful beach used for swimming. Swimming in salt water is one of the cures of leprosy.

The lepers live in stone huts built by themselves, and each year a prize is given to the house having
the most beautiful garden. The colony has its own government, money, jail, store, hospital, and workshop. Also, there is a
theatre which was given by the Empress of Japan. Almost always there are twenty or thirty lepers outside the gates
of this colony, some of whom have walked as far as two or three hundred miles, hoping against hope that
they might be admitted into what is their dream of paradise. As soon as the collection is made it will
be possible to admit many more of these outcasts from society to the colony. Several chapel talks to the Davidson
student body will explain the work in detail, and news will be posted on the bulletin board.

Try-Outs Will Be On Monday

Three Speakers Will Represent School At Winthrop

Try-outs for speakers to represent Davidson in the annual Winthrop College public speaking tournament will be held next Monday night
in the Phi Hall. Three men will be chosen from those trying out to be the local representatives at the
tournament which will be held at Winthrop in Rock Hill, S. C., on the weekend of December 4th and 5th.
Those who have signed up for the Monday night trials are: Dick Kenyon, Bob Ramsey, Drury Thompson, Paul Crane, Bill
Loftin, George Milne, Tom Fry, Chal Vinson, Sherrard Rice, and Frank Barker. Others may enter by seeing Joe Calvin, President
of the Forensic Council, who is in charge of the try-outs. Subjects for speeches and types of speaking will be
widely varied. Contestants may enter in any one of the following fields: oratory, extemporaneous speaking, impromptu speaking, harangue, debate, or
after-dinner speaking. Winners will be announced in each field.

Immediately following the Winthrop tournament the interest of the Forensic council will be centered upon the varsity debate try-outs, which
will take place about the second week in September. After varsity try-outs have been completed and the team selected, freshman
debate try-outs will be held. Both try-outs use the same question, that of the Pi Kappa Delta national debating fraternity.

Dunbar To Return

Mr. Dunbar, the annual photographer from Dunbar and Daniel, will be at Davidson for two days, Wednesday and Thursday, November
30 and December 1. He will be here in order to take all pictures of students not taken previously. Pictures
of the faculty will also be taken during this time. Appointments for the pictures will be made by the faculty
in order to avoid delay. Several of the group pictures will also be taken. Announcements will be made as to
the time and location of these various group pictures.

ROTC Men Issued Bids

Captain Wesley Coghill Leads Tapping Ceremonies During Parade

Four men were tapped by Scabbard and Blade, national military honor society, Monday afternoon at a special parade. The men
issued bids were: Louis Hipp, Eugene Liipfert, Bill Beaty, and George Jones. Captain Wesley Coghill, commanding officer of the local
company of Scabbard and Blade and Captain Samuel Hemphill, second lieutenant of Scabbard and Blade conducted the impressive tapping ceremonies
by which the men were pledged to the society.

These men were formally initiated at 6 A. M. Tuesday morning at a sunrise service.

Pittman And Mullen To Attend Fraternity Conference

Raymond Pittman, president of the Pan-Hellenic Council, and Tom Mullen, vice-president, will attend the National Interfraternity Conference to be held
November 25th and 26th in New York City.

The conference will be held Friday and Saturday in Hotel Commodore in New York City. Various valuable talks will be
heard by the attending delegates. The program consists of the following items: On Friday morning, discussions will be held on
“The Value of National Affiliation,” its costs and benefits. Also talks will be made on making Pan-Hellenic Council more efficient
in college life. On Friday afternoon, there will be a general session in which distinguished speakers will discuss, “What the
college expects from fraternities.” Friday evening group meetings will be held. On Saturday morning, undergraduates delegates may present questions and
problems, which will be answered by experienced fraternity leaders. Round table discussions will be grouped according to smaller and larger
colleges. It is expected that delegates from 800-1000 schools over the United States will be present. The conference offers a
unique opportunity to undergraduates to bring their problems to national leaders.

The Davidson delegation also expects to attempt to make the final arrangements toward securing a band for the Mid-Winters dance
set. Several booking agents will be present.

Pan-Hellenic Council Sends Conference Group

Proposal Accepted By Large Majority

Committees To Handle Discussions Between Faculty And Students

HAS EIGHT MEMBERS

Three From Faculty Five From Students

The Student-Faculty Conference Committee motion was passed by an overwhelming vote of 351 for, to 10 against, by the Student
Body at the Tuesday morning assembly.

The motion presented by President Fred Stair and Professor C. K. Brown will go into effect immediately.

Freshmen may get their grades by reporting to their respective faculty advisors, while upperclassmen’s grades are obtainable in the Registrar's
office. This report covers the work of the semester from the opening of school in September until the present time
and includes daily grades and the grades from two scheduled sets of reviews.

The Student-Faculty committee will be composed of eight members. Three of the members will be elected by the faculty and
the five other members will be from the student body. These men will be the presidents of the three upper
classes, the Freshman Advisor, and the fifth member is to be selected from Omicron Delta Kappa, the leadership fraternity.

There is every indication that the Atlanta meeting will be largely attended; the program calls for three full days, November
24-26, with three daily sessions filled with papers presented by various members.

Dr. Harding Is To Give Paper

Dr. C. R. Harding left today for Atlanta to attend the meeting of the Southern Section of the Classical Association
of the Middle West and South where he will read a paper, entitled Pictorial Settings of Scenes from the Iliad,
illustrated with about twenty slides. The parent body meets in the spring; however, when the place of meeting is too
distant from the homes of the majority of the Southern members, this Southern Section holds a fall meeting. From time
to time the entire body holds its meeting in some central point such as Nashville, Louisville or St. Louis.

Grades Come Out

Mid-semester grades came out this morning. This is the second report of the semester and will be the last one
issued this semester until after mid-year exams.

Eight Men Formally Initiated

Ga. Tech Man Feted by ODK

Prof. F. B. Wenn Of Georgia Tech Visits Here

Professor Fred B. Wenn of Georgia School of Technology was a visitor on the Davidson Campus Saturday, November the nineteenth.
Professor Wenn, who is Province Deputy of Omicron Delta Kappa, paid a visit to the local O. D. K. chapter.
A luncheon meeting was held in his honor in Chambers banquet hall. Student members of the society and several faculty
members were present. Professor Wenn delivered an interesting address on his idea for O. D. K. activities. Among the thoughts
which he brought out were some worthwhile projects which had been sponsored at Georgia Tech. In the absence of Warren
Gaw, president of the local organization, Fred Stair presided and F. L. Jackson, college treasurer, introduced the speaker. Professor Wenn
journeyed from here to Columbia to speak at the University of South Carolina. Prior to his visit at Davidson, he
had attended a Conference at Duke University on the economic changes in the south.

This phonograph is in two parts: contacted. Fall Dance Set To Be Held December 9 and 10. The record player
and a large amplifier nearly five feet high, built by the Federal Radio Company. The set is being installed in
the Chambers banquet hall. The complete library will contain 1,000 records, 150 musical scores, 100 books on music, and a
walnut cabinet for the record albums and books. The selection of records covers music from the earliest times to present-day
compositions and ranges from symphonies, operas, and miscellaneous classics to Benny Goodman’s trio.

A mock court-martial will be held in Chambers Auditorium Friday night, December 2nd, at 8 o'clock. The accused officer is
Jim Armstrong, who is charged with drawing a weapon upon an officer, assaulting, and willful insubordination. The trial will be
conducted by the D-Club, with Coach Laird introduced to the group. Coach Laird congratulated the group on its founding, and
he hoped that the thirty-six charter members of the group would do all that they could to carry on athletics
here at Davidson. The members of the Davidson teams very seldom receive recognition in the first two years of their
stay here, but students should not be discouraged by this fact. “Don't give up,” said Laird, in regard to athletics.
“The only way to get the most out of them is to keep plugging,” he concluded.

Students Entertained At Queens

Queens-Chicora College entertained the Davidson College student body at a Queens-Davidson party held last Thursday night on the Queens campus.
The Sophomore class, under the direction of Miss Elizabeth Brammer of Christiansburg, Va., and Miss Mary Payne of Charlotte, presented
a burlesque play on the “prologue” from Chaucer’s “Canterbury Tales.” Miss Sarah Thompson, who portrayed the Miller in not quite
the manner in which Chaucer draws him, caused a nearby riot with her part.

The boys began arriving around 6:30 by bus and by car. For those who had not already gotten dates, a
dating bureau was set up under the direction of Mrs. Lowrance. The Sophomore class was judged the best for its
stunt and gallery on Wednesday night and were presented with a silver cup. The judges from Davidson, composed of one
boy from each class, again picked the Sophomores as best. The Junior Class presented “Cinderella.” Miss Frances Stough and Miss
Georgia Hurt were chairmen of their stunt and gallery. A take-off on Shakespeare’s “Taming of the Shrew” was presented by
the Senior class. Miss Mildred DuRant and Miss Frances Rein were in charge of the stunt.

Following the stunts, the students moved to the dining hall and were led in singing by Miss Helen Cumnock, president
of the Chicora student body. The girls served supper on the back campus. The Davidson boys were given a chance
to vote on the candidates for “Miss Popularity” of Queens. The contest was sponsored by Alpha Kappa Gamma, national leadership
fraternity.

The faculty has notified the Pan-Hellenic Council that costumes will be allowed at the coming Fall Dances which will be
held on December 9 and 10 at the Armory Auditorium in Charlotte. A costume ball Saturday night had been considered
by the Council as a means of adding variety to the dance set. This plan has been tried here in
years past at the Balls held each Spring. The last of these was in the spring of 1937.

The group shall be considered as a single committee for purposes of consultation and exchange of views. This, it is
believed, will facilitate a free and frank interchange of ideas and viewpoints upon college matters of general interest to the
students and faculty. For the purposes of making recommendations, the student and faculty members of the group shall be considered
as constituting two separate committees, so that a majority of each shall be required to bring any matter to the
attention of the proper authority concerned.

An illustrated lecture on the Japanese-Chinese situation will feature the next meeting of the Quadranglers, faculty club, scheduled for Thursday
night, December 1. The program, originally scheduled for November 24, was postponed on account of Thanksgiving festivities until the following
Thursday. Time of the meeting will be 7:30. Major Steel, military science instructor, will be the speaker of the evening
and will illustrate his lecture on the crisis in the far east with slides, according to plans for the meeting
announced recently.

Five new members were initiated into Sigma Pi Sigma, national honorary physics fraternity, at its regular meeting Monday night: W.
C. Johnston, C. C. Clark, A. C. Warlick, R. K. Allison, and W. E. Kunz. Bids were sent out to
these five men after their election at the last meeting. A sixth man, V. A. Myers, has also accepted a
bid and will be initiated at a later time. Allison, Kunz, and Myers are Juniors, and the other initiates are
members of the Senior class.

Election to this fraternity requires an exceptionally high scholastic average in both mathematics and physics, there being only seven men
in the entire body eligible for membership. B. Benfield, president of the chapter, presided at a business meeting preceding the
initiation. A social is planned for the near future, and at the next meeting papers will be read by W.
A. Page, vice-president of the chapter, and R. N. Aycock. Ten old members and three faculty members were present for
the initiation. Sigma Pi Sigma was founded at Davidson College in 1921. The initiation was held at the home of
Dr. J. M. Douglas, who is now one of the national officers of the fraternity. There are now seventy-seven chapters
in colleges and universities throughout the country.

Sponsors for the Davidson team are: Ann Sutherland, Knoxville, Tenn., sponsor for Bill Bolin, Back; Isabel Anderson, Badin, for Bill
Davis, back; Marguerite Vance, Johnson City, Tenn., for Capt. David Warden, tackle; Mary K. McLaughlin, Cleveland, for Luke Graham, tackle;
