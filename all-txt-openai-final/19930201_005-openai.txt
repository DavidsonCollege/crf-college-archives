Professor Resigns Over Ethics Controversy

By Maggie Lehan - The University Times, UNCC

CHARLOTTE, NC - A professor of Judaic studies at the University of North Carolina-Charlotte resigned after it was discovered that
he was secretly holding two full-time teaching positions at two different universities while receiving salaries totaling $146,400.

Tzvee Zahavy, a nationally known Talmud scholar, was hired by UNCC last year as a result of a two-year national
search to fill the Isaac Swift Distinguished Professorship in Judaic Studies. UNCC was unaware that at the same time, the
professor was still holding his previous position at the University of Minnesota.

At UNCC beginning in October, Zahavy taught a class titled “Judaism in the Time of Early Christianity” for two hours
on Mondays and Wednesdays, then would fly back to Minnesota, where he taught two of the same classes on Thursdays.
The 1,000-mile commute allowed Zahavy to pick up the hefty salaries from both universities. He also received an advance of
$5,000 from UNCC for moving expenses, which he never used.

In December, just two months after Zahavy’s arrival, UNCC Chancellor Jim Woodward asked Zahavy to resign and requested that he
reimburse the university $5,000. Zahavy agreed to pay back the money. The University of Minnesota has also requested the professor’s
resignation.

Higher Enrollment Expected

(CPS) WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Education estimates that 16.1 million students will be enrolled in colleges and universities
by 2003, up 14 percent from 14.2 million students in 1991. The projections are included in the department’s Projections of
Education Statistics to 2003, which includes estimates on elementary, secondary, and postsecondary education. It is the first report on educational
statistics that reflects 1990 Census population estimates and projections.

The findings include projections that high school graduates will number 2.5 million for the next two years, which will be
the smallest graduating classes since 1964-65. By 2003, the number is expected to rise 20 percent to 3 million. Teacher
salaries are expected to rise 20 percent between now and 2003, and per student spending should rise 24 percent, the
report said.

Family Sues for $8 Million

(CPS) TALLAHASSEE, Fla. - The family of a Florida State University student who died after diving into a trapeze safety
net used by the school’s Flying High Circus has accused the school of negligence and is seeking $8 million in
damages.

Stacey Lynne Stokes, 20, of Fort Myers, died October 31 at a Tallahassee hospital. According to police reports, Stokes, who
was not a member of the circus, scaled two fences posted with no trespassing signs and climbed a platform before
jumping into the net, which collapsed. The family is asking for $5 million in damages for Stokes’ parents and $3
million for a younger sister “for emotional distress and loss of her sister.”

In addition, he has worked on commissions for Mecklenburg County and for the state under Governors Holshouser and Martin. Davidson
has given history lessons to students, professional associations, civic clubs, scout groups, committees for the county, and alumni groups. He
has published many articles on the history of North and South Carolina in various journals and has also written ten
books, most on Tar Heel subjects. Davidson, a third-generation graduate of the college whose grandfather was Col. William Lee Davidson
in the class of 1842, wrote *The Generations of Davidson College* in 1955. He continues to update it about the
family histories of Davidson College. Other awards Davidson has received include the Charles A. Cannon Cup for North Carolina History,
Raleigh News & Observer’s Tar Heel of the Week, the Preservation Award from the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Historic Properties Commission, and the
Alumni Service Award from Davidson College.

Davidson is a proud preserver of the ideals of Southern gentility. He defines Davidson College as “a way of life
based on the things of the mind, tempered by manners and morality.” According to Davidson, it is traditional that Davidson
students respect and uphold basic manners and morals that set the college apart from others. He said, “We do things
a little bit differently from those schools that are as good but do not have the stress on manners and
morals like Davidson.”

South Asia

Continued from page 1

A symbol was chosen for its flyers: The Lotus flower. This flower, a religious symbol, grows up out of muddy
river beds, its blossoms decorating the water’s surface. Jayasinghe expressed the importance of South Asia Week ’93 quite eloquently as
he spoke of the flower using a metaphor: “Because the lotus flower represents wisdom it shows us how wisdom sees
through the murkiness of ignorance.” Indeed, after February fifteenth Davidson students may no longer innocently profess ignorance about South Asia.
Thanks to the Dean Rusk Program this area of the world is coming to us.
