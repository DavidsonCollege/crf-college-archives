THE DAVIDSONIAN ARTS AL LIVING October 25, 1995 11

After several frustrating days of answering machines, eager assistants, and roaming publicity managers, I finally found myself at the business
end of a phone line staring down Rob Bonaccorsi. Some may wonder why anyone would go to such lengths to
talk to Bonaccorsi, and until I succeeded, I was among them. He is, in fact, one of three guitarists for
the Freddy Jones Band, which has just recently released their second major label album, North Ave. Wake Up Call. They
also played alongside Joan Osborne and Widespread Panic yesterday at the Blockbuster Pavilion in Charlotte.

In talking with Bonaccorsi, I learned that the band has been together for four years with their current lineup. Everything
started when Marty Lloyd (acoustic guitar, vocals) met Wayne Healy (guitar, vocals) in college and later hooked up with Jim
Bonaccorsi (bass) and Simon Horrocks (drums). Bonaccorsi completed the group by replacing a keyboardist who left the band early.

The five started out by playing the bar scene on Chicago’s north side and eventually began to venture out. They
released an independent album, and while preparing to enter the studio for a second, Capricorn Records approached them looking for
a band ready to record. FJB fit the bill, and in the fall of 1993, Waiting for the Night was
released. In an attempt to support their album, the band launched a tour that stretched from fall into winter and
along 250 days with a month break. The band opened for such groups as Big Head Todd and the Monsters
as well as Widespread Panic.

I was curious to hear how everyone got along after driving across most of the country in such close quarters.
Bonaccorsi said that for the most part, things went well. “We’ve got to get up on stage and look at
one another and try to have the time of our lives every night.” He was excited to hook up with
Widespread again for Sunday’s show. “We were out with them for two and a half months. We were like one
big family, so we’ve kept in close contact,” he said.

Bonaccorsi described the touring schedule as “sleep, get up, soundcheck, play, go back to sleep” but says he loves it
regardless: “It’s a privilege to be able to be on the road and play every single night.”

Asked about how songs were written and fleshed out, Bonaccorsi had a lot to say. “There’s no real formula. It
kind of evolves and manifests itself in different forms.” Sometimes someone will present a song sketch, music, or just lyrics
and the band makes it their own. The five spent three months rehearsing before recording the current album for which
their producer, Justin Niebank, occasionally flew up.from Nashville. In the studio, the songs were recorded from rehearsed foundations up to
the finest details. He said the work is a collaborative effort where everyone is open to suggestions. “The guys in
the band are very supportive.” What emerged from this involved process was a very tight album. The songs on North
Ave. Wake Up Call are well-structured, and the musicianship is excellent. What didn’t emerge was any form of progressive sound.
The backbone of the Freddy Jones Band is classic blues rock with a sprinkle of the college sound to tie
it together. The songs on the whole are of the same flavor and tone, varying little in their delivery and
gimmicks. For the most part, this is an album for those interested in the traditional with a few twists.
