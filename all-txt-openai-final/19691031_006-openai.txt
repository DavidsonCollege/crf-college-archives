Rep. Al Lowenstein
Congressman Allard Lowenstein, one of the most vocal new members of the U.S. House of Representatives, will be on campus
this winter for a lecture sponsored by Beta Theta Pi fraternity. Described last year by DAVIDSONIAN staffer Bill Lineaweaver as
a "mixture of Adlai Stevenson and Mort Sahl," Lowenstein will speak as this year’s Beta Lecturer.

One of the founders of the “Dump Johnson” movement, he has been a key figure in leadership and a speaker
in wide demand on college campuses. A graduate of the University of North Carolina, where he was student body president,
Lowenstein was president of the Association of New York prior to his election to the House. He has been on
the board of directors of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and was the founder of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party.
Of his political stance, Lowenstein once said, "I think of myself as a liberal. You're not told by anyone how
to stand on issues; you find your own truths, if you can." He was a supporter of Eugene McCarthy in
the 1968 Democratic race. Journalist Jack Newfield described the congressman as constantly involved, saying, "Being a friend of Lowenstein is
like being on a phone constantly."

Trustees (Continued From Page 1)
Controversial issues such as subsidized athletics, fraternity life, and full coeducation were discussed. Spencer said that he places high priority
on procuring a development and fundraising staff before next fall. He pointed out that the highlight of the Vanderbilt University
symposium was speakers such as McGeorge Bundy, Edmund Muskie, and Phil Hart. The trustees will meet again in January to
continue action on today’s proposals and receive additional requests. Spencer said that many decisions would be carried over to the
May 2 meeting in order to...

Lowenstein engaged in an exchange with Scheer regarding the use of violence in campus demonstrations and received several spontaneous standing
ovations during the course of the debate. Lowenstein follows Stephen Spender in a line of Beta lecturers. He will appear
at Davidson on a date to be announced soon, according to Beta President John Baker.

Zeffirelli’s Film Mawkish, Too Commercial, Says Hoyt
By DON HOYT
The All-American Boy is Romeo, and Juliet is The Girl Next Door. Franco Zeffirelli’s film of the tragedy shows that
the public will swallow any pap surrounded by the aura of Culture and proclaim it delicious. It is generally recognized
that the film is not good, which is the opinion held fast by...

The cost of sending two or three members of the staff to school in order to learn to operate the
system will be included in each bid. Honeywell, General Electric, IBM, National Cash Register, and Univac are bidding for the
contract.

What is not so generally recognized is that Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet" is not a good film. For example, the
mawkishness with which a throbbing chord suddenly, at a moment such as that when Juliet stabs herself, crescendos and goes
up a sixth shows that Ziffirelli depended upon the syrupy score to bring the audience to an emotional climax which
it would reach from neither the language (much of the best Shakespeare is cut) nor the acting. The movie could
serve as a paradigm for converting literature into profitable ventures. Seventeen chose the film to be Picture of the Month,
realizing that its readers would be delighted with Romeo's modish hairstyle and titillated by the views of his nude backside.
Ziffirelli has included several quick shots of Juliet’s budding breasts in the balcony scene. Romeo says, "See how she leans
her cheek upon her hand!" What the director wants the audience to see, though, is Juliet’s bosom ready to pop
out of her nightdress. The movie has a few good points, however. The nurse in particular is brilliantly realized; every
scene in which she appears is a success, and her encounter with Mercutio is especially marvelous.

Gilberts Take Students On Slide Tour Of France
By STEVE ROADY Staff Writer

Students entering the Morrison Room on Wednesday at ten stumbled out a half hour later with an extreme case of
wanderlust. In the second gathering of the Union's "Around the World in 80 Cups of Coffee" program, Montpellier’s envoy to
Davidson, Jacques Gilbert, took the crowd on a slide tour of his homeland. Assisted by his wife Josette, Jacques started
with Paris, then progressed to Versailles, the castles of the Loire Valley, scenes from Southern France, Montpellier, and ended the
tour at Monaco.

In answering certain questions about his hometown, he noted that the mayor of Montpellier likes the United States very much,
and commented that the mayor had even granted the people a day off when America landed men on the moon.
Jacques also pointed out the fact that there is no university campus proper in Montpellier. Instead, each department has a
building in the downtown area. Speaking for the students, he said, "We prefer to live in the center of the
city. I don’t want to see only students during the day or during the week. I like to speak to
other people."

The next in the "Around the World" Series will be a visit to Australia on Wednesday, November 5, at ten.
