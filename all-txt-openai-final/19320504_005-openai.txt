Col. Little Conducts R.O.T.C. Inspection
Banquet Is Given in Honor of Visiting Military Official

The annual inspection of the R.O.T.C. unit at Davidson was held Wednesday, April 20, at 2:30 on the drill field.
Colonel Little, of Winston-Salem, was in charge of the proceedings which were conducted with due form and regularity.

At 12:30 Tuesday afternoon, a luncheon was given in honor of Colonel Little in the banquet hall of Chambers Building.
Members of the military department, members of Scabbard and Blade, national military fraternity, the new pledges, Colonel Little, and President
Walter L. Lingle were present.

Colonel Little is in charge of organized reserves in the northeastern section of North Carolina. During the war, he was
in command of the 81st Regiment, one of the combat divisions in France. He is now retired from the army
service and was designated by the War Department in Washington, D.C., to make the inspection at Davidson.

Don King presided at the luncheon given in Colonel Little’s honor. Colonel Little gave a short talk, in which he
stated that he was very much in favor of a world-wide peace. Following this informal speech, Dr. Lingle spoke concerning
the R.O.T.C. department at Davidson and stated that emphasis upon military training would prove very beneficial to the students. The
visitor was very cordially received and expressed his pleasure at being in Davidson.

Janitors Have New Convenient Showers

Recently the college carpenters finished a private shower under the fire escape in the rear of Georgia dormitory, reserved for
the use of the janitors of the school. The shower is furnished very conveniently with cement floor, hot and cold
water, and other necessary accessories. The janitors have been needing this for quite a while, in fact, ever since the
building of the college, for after a day’s work in the dust and dirt of the dormitories they may here
clean and refresh themselves before leaving. Georgia dormitory seems to be the most convenient place available for such a necessary
thing, as it is mid-way between the rest of the dorms in the row and therefore easily attainable for use.
