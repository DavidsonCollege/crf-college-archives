### Chanukah

**Chanukah celebrates the covenant between man and God**

Chanukah is the Jewish celebration of lights. Although many would equate its importance to the Jewish people as equal to Christmas for Christians, it is a relatively minor holiday. It falls so close to, and sometimes coincides with Christmas depending on the lunar calendar, so it, too, has become a time of gift-giving. Originally, though, Chanukah did not have such a commercial character. It is a holiday about celebrating the enduring covenant between man and God.

Thousands of years ago, in Judea, a tyrannical Greek king, Antiochus, decided that the Jews should not be worshipping their God and should instead worship the pantheon of Greek gods. Antiochus sent soldiers into Jerusalem where they destroyed the sacred temple and forced the Jews to stop practicing Judaism. Pagan statues were erected in the desecrated temple.

The Jewish people had trouble fighting against the Greek soldiers; they were a largely agrarian society with little military strength. A group of people led by Judah Maccabee disappeared into the mountains to prepare for a revolt. After some time and a lot of careful strategizing, the Maccabees, as they came to be called, emerged to fight the Greeks and amazingly were victorious.

When they returned to re-establish the sacred temple, not only did they find most of it was destroyed, but the supply of oil for the eternal light, a light kept incessantly burning in synagogues to maintain the covenant of God and Abraham, was destroyed as well. They searched the rubble of the temple only to find a small bottle of oil lurking in a corner, but even this small supply was not enough oil to keep the light burning until they could get a new supply. Miraculously, the oil kept the eternal light lit for eight days, and thus Jews celebrate Chanukah to not only commemorate the victory of the Maccabees over the Greeks, but the miracle of the oil. These events proved to the Jews the presence and reliability of God.

The eight days the oil burned is remembered by contemporary Jews with the eight lights on the Chanukah Menorah, with a ninth candle to light the others. We also eat food like “latkes,” or potato pancakes because they are cooked in oil, as well as other fried foods. It is a time for family to be together, a time for sharing joy and peace, gifts and embraces. Chanukah is the Jewish remembrance of the power of miracles.

### A Holiday at the Movies

**Romeo and Juliet, The English Patient, and 101 Dalmatians hit the theaters; some films hit harder than others**

**Romeo and Juliet: Shakespeare meets Robocop**

Why bring Romeo and Juliet to the screen and then twist it, mutilate it, into a pseudo-arthouse film which, in the end, seems more like Robocop than Shakespeare? The answer is, simply, the film was attempting to fuse two mediums, Shakespearean...Melodramatic acting with rock-video directing. Choppy, sped-up editing during certain scenes was enough to give a viewer a migraine. A lot of Shakespeare’s lines—the ones that were not cut—were obscured and lost due to the fast, jerky editing, and the manner in which they were delivered; screaming lines over gunshots, screeching tires, and loud soundtrack music generally makes them hard to hear and, especially in Shakespeare’s case, to fully digest. The best moments in the movie were the quiet ones between Romeo (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Juliet (Claire Danes). These two actors showed themselves to be skillful at creating a relationship, which had to range from the warmly playful to the tragically intense. Grade: C — JC

Exams loom in the not-far-enough future, deadlines for papers plague the minds of diligent students, and Davidson’s usual friendly atmosphere has taken on a darker tone, shadowed by the stress of our over-achieving minds. However, on Tuesday night, the entire campus brightened up—literally. There was a phenomenal turnout at the traditional campus-wide Christmas party and tree lighting, sponsored by the Union. Students bearing backpacks took a short study break to celebrate the joy of the Christmas season.

However, everyone was disappointed that Santa and Mrs. Claus didn’t rappel down Chambers. It just wasn’t the same without that magical moment of Santa’s suspension in air. The freshmen felt disillusioned. I heard one question the authenticity of the event, wondering if she had just been naive enough to believe that Davidson legend. “I thought Santa was supposed to rappel down Chambers or something,” she said, sounding a little betrayed. “Did I miss it?” Nope, kids, you didn’t miss anything, it just didn’t happen. Rumor has it that Santa the rappeller was feeling under the weather and not up to his agile self.

Some were also a little overcome by the treats Santa threw from his bag as he drove recklessly through the crowd. Evidently, good old St. Nick does watch us when we’re sleeping, knows when we’re awake, knows if we’ve been bad or good, and is quite knowledgeable of the Union’s relentless campaign for AIDS awareness, as from his bag of goodies he produced condoms, which he threw into the crowd.

Nevertheless, the campus-wide Christmas was a huge success, offering socialization and study reprieve for worn-out, midnight oil-burning scholars. Cookies, apple cider, and hot chocolate were offered by the Union, appeasing stress-induced appetites. As the bells from DCPC rang in the Christmas season and volunteers from the concert choir led the attendees in carols, the lights illuminated the lawn just before everyone’s candles melted away. The spirit of Christmas suddenly appeared all over campus. Santa hats and elf outfits could be seen at every turn. Smiling, festive friends gathered for pictures, and for a while, everyone seemed to forget about all the responsibilities that this time of year brings and enjoy the season.
