**Rude Notes & Random Scribblings**

**Chris Frampton**

The last few editions of “Rude Notes and Random Scribblings” have been focused on specific problems about campus. It is high time we return to the bold-faced format of yesteryear. Let’s take a look at some questions being stirred about by the wind that is a Davidson student's mind. (What?)

Does anybody have a nickel? Why on Earth do drinks now cost fifty-five cents? And another thing, why don’t they lower the prices of candy in the library to forty-five cents? I used to put a dollar into the Coke machine and then use the change to buy a candy bar, but now I put the change in my pocket. It’s their loss.

Will Coach McKillop ever impress us? Davidson has historically loved its basketball. The problem is we don’t win anymore. We seem to have the players so why don’t we have the victories? (Please, don’t let the players attack me. I really do like basketball, I’m just greedy and want to win more.)

Is it going to snow? No.

Do you want to go to Midwinters with me? No.

Did you see how big his #@!% was? Yes, I actually heard two girls talking about this three days after Self-Selection night.

Are you going to watch 90210? Whoever it is out there asking this question every Thursday night needs help. This may be the worst show on television. Why? Because a pathetic character in this poorly written farce, Steve, actually tried to pay fifty dollars to buy a six-pack of beer.

Does the SGA do anything? That depends. Do you mean actual physical work? If you do, then the answer is no. All they do is make committees that talk about things. If you want to see a group on campus that works, check out the Union Board.

For whom are you going to vote? This is a good question. The absence of the SGA on campus is a problem that needs to be fixed and the only way is to vote the right people into office.

Are there racial problems on campus? Yes.

Are you going to Backstreet tonight? Yes.

I'm too sexy for this column.

“You should get involved with the Union. It’s a great and wonderful place!”—I am even more excited about the Union now than I was then.

**Davidsonian:** You were fortunate enough to be Historian for the Union while Catharina Chang was president. How would you do things in comparison to her methods?

**Willard:** I enjoyed being on the Board with Catharina, and I think she did a really wonderful job as president. I’m not sure how I would do things differently. I would just have to be a part of it, and see how things develop. I would much rather be involved and handle things as they happen.

**Davidsonian:** Have you had any specific ideas regarding the Union’s role in conjunction with, or separate from Patterson Court?

**Willard:** When I first became a part of the Union my freshman year, I had no idea what the Union was all about. I got involved because Catharina asked me to. After I became involved, I realized what...opportunities the Union provides. It provides opportunities to have a good time, and learn a lot. It's a different atmosphere than Patterson Court, and I’d like to see the Union remain a vital part of Davidson life. I’d like to see the Union work with Patterson Court, so there can be a synthesis and people can enjoy both parts of the campus.

Davidsonian: Could you tell me what you think makes a leader, and how you think you fulfill those requirements?

Willard: I always see a leader as someone who can listen to what others are saying, and see what they are doing, and guide as necessary. I don’t like to tell people what to do, unless they ask for direction. As a leader I would like to help, listen, and offer whatever help I can. I think the Union Presidency allows you to do that.

...clipped off the distance between him and us as Ted neared the bottom, where nothing even thought about flattening out until the 4-Way and the Big Red Sign. But Southerners can’t drive on snow (though Ted could fly) and some frictionless Rebel braked too late or too soon or not at all and the long and short of it is that a car appeared out of nowhere, slid sideways, and protruded into the intersection like a confused dog on linoleum. Ted didn’t wobble; he just needed to stop. A lesser force might have bailed, rolled left or right and right into a tree or mailbox or parked car and died. But Ted, in his own words describing his logic after the fact, “...thought I might could just aim at that support wire that comes down from the telephone pole and just sorta’ slide up. You know, ease myself to a stop.” Again in his own words, he “musta’ hit a little off center” because his sled flipped like a pancake you’re pissed at and Ted went ballistic, an upstart missile, and a lucky one, since he landed in some old lady’s bush which hadn’t been pruned since the Great Depression. Somehow in the process though, maybe from a runner or maybe from the support wire, the index finger on Ted’s left hand got just about severed. The doctors did it up, he got a finger-length pin shoved down it and what’s funny is I remember thinking that pin was kind of cool. I think some people were even jealous. But Ted was blessed. Some devil went balls out for glory in his brain and some angel always padded his landings. Ted moved me; and because of him, well, not completely because of him, but at least with fond recollections of him connecting with that sled, I love snow. I love it. And when rumored reports of the fluffy stuff swept campus this past week, the hair on my neck stiffened again. God, I hope it snows.

You could barely hear his Keds padding on the accumulation until he hit the sidewalk; then it just sounded like speed.
