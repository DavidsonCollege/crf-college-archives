**Francis Kofe’s visit to Davidson is enlightening for students**

By Nick Paul

About a week ago, a man named Francis Kofe came to Davidson. He offered the student body an evening’s entertainment
of Ghanaian tribal dance and music. Of the 30 or 40 students that attended, I expect that most of them,
like me, were anticipating a fairly unique cultural experience. No one who entered that room was ready for what this
man had in store.

The first thing that Kofe did was dance. In stature, he is not a large man, but his powerful, lithe
body spun its way around the stage and out into the audience, exuding its own independent rhythm which the audience
could virtually feel as his dance progressed. His dances ranged anywhere from an intricate series of contortions that he would
perform with the assistance of a stereo beat for back-up to a lively and contagious dance that he often called
members of the audience up to help him with. His friendly and disarming nature was a pleasure to experience.

During his dance, Kofe sang in his own African tribal tradition. Performing a small dramatic act, he expressed his belief
in music as an intangible gift that can be transmitted between people of any race or origin. Sometimes he sang
in English, sometimes in his own language; the message, though, did not need words.

Kofe told jokes, using no other instrument than the human body as a medium to communicate his humor to members
of the audience who bashfully joined him on stage. His performing skills were such that we needed no words to
understand when he was changing the mood of the act. He displayed periods of fear, sorrow, epiphany, and joy, each
with their own song, their own dance, and their own costume.

To finish his act, Kofe called us all to his stage, teaching the movements of his tribal dance. After this
was finished, he took a few moments to express his thanks to those who had made the performance possible. He
also imparted upon us a few words of wisdom, explaining his belief that God is manifested throughout all nations and
cultures in the form of music.

When asked if he wanted to say any-

**Honor Code Caper steals the $150 million show**

The grand finale to celebrate the Campaign for Davidson’s success in exceeding their goal of $150 million was not a
solemn affair marred by dull speeches written to make even the most sophisticated donor find playing tic-tac-toe on their programs
seem attractive. It was a festive, good-humored occasion designed to thank the beneficiaries for their generous donations and make them
feel good about their gifts. The Great Honor Code Caper was just the way to celebrate the excitement of surpassing
their goal.

Over a year and a half ago, Brad Griffin ‘93, who now works in the Office of Institutional Advancement, was
presented with the challenge of writing a musical for the Campaign finale. Jamie May, Campaign Director, and Susan Abbott, Campaign
Special Events Coordinator, entrusted him with this project in hopes that his creativity and ingenuity would successfully end the six-year
climb to their goal.

Griffin’s first draft of The Great Honor Code Caper — the story of a bitter student not accepted to Davidson
who, seeking revenge, steals the Honor Code, resulting in a crazed, dishonest campus — was written in July. With the
help of Professors Joe Gardner and Ann Marie Costa (director), by late August the working script was finished. New words
to pre-existing show tunes were provided by Griffin, who also found that he had to do some research on the
main characters of the play in order to give the script a genuine quality. Says Griffin, “President Kuykendall, for example,
has a distinct way of forming his sentences. His grammar is painstakingly correct, and he can call up vocabulary words
that would stump the editors of the GRE. I took those personality traits and blew them up to make the
John Kuykendall of the Caper a super-hero of
