**Seed with win over Ga. Southern**

LEXINGTON, Va. — Showered by taunts from hostile cadets, the men’s basketball team delivered a near-flawless performance last Monday at
Hall, dismissing the Keydets 90-66 in what coach Bob McKillop called “without a doubt” the team’s most complete effort this
season. Mark Donnelly scored 21 points on 7-for-8 shooting, including 3-of-3 marksmanship from three-point land, as the Wildcats won their
seventh straight game and ninth consecutive league bout.

Davidson worked the inside-outside game to perfection from the get-go, posting a 29-10 lead just eight-and-a-half minutes into the contest.
The Wildcats shot a blistering 62.1 percent from the floor in the first half and held VMI to a paltry
30.4 percent, staking a commanding 48-27 halftime advantage. The Keydets sliced the Davidson lead to 14 with 15:08 remaining but
never got any closer. The Wildcats’ biggest lead was 26 — 90-64 in the final minute.

“I’m thrilled with our inside game,” said McKillop, referring to another set of solid showings from Stephen Marshall, Landry Kosmalski,
and Ben Ebong, who tallied 18, 13, and 12 points, respectively, and teamed for 22 rebounds.

Davidson’s defense wasn’t half-bad, either. The Wildcats, who are holding conference opponents this season to 39 percent shooting, limited VMI
to 37.9 percent. And Keydet guard Jason Bell, who averaged 25 points in his four games prior to Monday, went
for only nine in a thoroughly unproductive outing.

“That team played as well as any team we’ve played this year,” said VMI coach Bart Bellairs, whose Keydets fell
to 7-6 in the Southern Conference and 13-11 overall. “That’s the level we want our program to be at.”

Said Donnelly: “Comparing this game to when we played VMI a month ago” — a 61-58 loss in which Davidson
blew a 14-point second-half lead — “it shows how much we’ve improved.”

**Wildcats 75, Georgia Southern 58**

Down 36-27 at halftime, the Wildcats went on a 16-0 run to start the second period to better Georgia Southern
Saturday at Belk Arena. With the win, Davidson clinched the top overall seed in this weekend’s Southern Conference tournament. Seniors
Mark Donnelly, Billy Armstrong, and Chris Stec, playing in their final home game at Davidson, were honored in an emotional
pregame ceremony.

Donnelly paced the Wildcats with 15 points, hitting 5-of-7 shots from the floor. Ben Ebong, after sitting on the bench
with foul trouble for all but three minutes of the first half, tallied 13 in the second. Stephen Marshall and
Landry Kosmalski notched 11 and 10 points, respectively, as Davidson overcame hot three-point shooting by the Eagles, who went 11-for-24
from beyond the arc, including 8-of-15 before intermission.

After a relatively poor first-half showing — perhaps caused by Senior Day jitters — the Wildcats outscored Georgia Southern by
26 in the second half to win their 11th straight conference game.

“Coach came into the locker room (at halftime) and gave us a good kick in the butt to get us
out of that emotional fog,” Donnelly said. “That showed in the second half.”

**Marshall named conference Player of the Week**

Stephen Marshall, a sophomore center from Richmond, Va., was named the Reebok/Southern Conference Men’s Basketball Player-of-the-Week for week 11 of
the basketball season. During this week, Marshall scored a combined 38 points in two games against UNC-Greensboro and VMI. In
the second of these two contests, he matched his season high of 20 points and also grabbed eight rebounds. Against
VMI, Marshall tallied 18 and was a perfect six-of-six from the line. Marshall was also 1-2 from three-point range. Without
regard to a minimum number of attempted three-pointers, Marshall is among the top three-point shooters in the conference.

**Wrestling squad easily defeats Longwood, loses to Campbell in final dual matches of season**

Squad finishes season at .500, the best finish by a Davidson team this decade

Though it is seldom given enough credit for its achievements, the wrestling team has achieved more this season than most
any other team on campus. With a defeat of the Longwood Lancers in the final match of the season on
Saturday, this season’s squad became the first to post a .500 regular season this decade. The team finished the regular
season 9-9-1. If not for an unfortunate tie early in the season with Anderson, the ‘Cats would have posted a
winning record for the year.

Davidson opened the match against Longwood by taking forfeits in the first two weight classes, and then giving up another
at 134. Of the remaining seven weight classes, the ‘Cats won another two by forfeit, three by decision, and lost
two. The final score was Davidson 40, Longwood 12.

In the second match of the day, the grapplers faced Campbell and had a chance to finish the season with
a winning record. That chance quickly vanished as Campbell won four of the first five weight classes. Dan Carman won
by forfeit in the first class. Davidson then lost one class by forfeit and three by decision. Ronald Williams posted
his second win of the day with a 13-3 decision to give the ‘Cats ten team points. The hopes for
a winning season disappeared as Campbell swept the remaining four weight classes with two decisions and two pins.

Davidson’s top two wrestlers, Ian Kaplan and Ben Wall, are preparing for the Southern Conference and NCAA tournaments.did not wrestle
in either of the matches. Last season, Wall reached the finals of his weight class, a feat not accomplished by
a Davidson wrestler in many years. Kaplan finished the season with an astounding 26-4 record and was 5-0 against Southern
Conference teams, who are the toughest opponents on Davidson’s schedule. He was the only wrestler in the conference to post
a perfect record at his weight class. Wall’s success last season and Kaplan’s impressive record this year are encouraging signs.
This season, Davidson could easily come away from Greensboro with two conference champions.

Ever see the Union in the Dark? Marshall, a junior, scored nine points in the last game against Duke. Marshall

Baseball team loses Friday, splits double-header Saturday

Baseball from page 16

After a Bowers strikeout, Coley O’Donnell doubled down the first base line past a diving Sloan, scoring O’Keefe. O’Donnell moved
to third on a wild pitch, and then scored when Paul Costello singled. The score remained tied at two as
both starting pitchers calmed down. In the bottom of the fifth, Brian Joyce reached second on an error by Providence
left fielder Jason Hairston. Using his great speed, Joyce was able to reach second. Goodwin followed Joyce with a walk.
As DeSimone stepped to the plate, no one was prepared for what occurred next. DeSimone, one of the best hitters
on the team, hit a long, high fly ball to deep left field. The crowd waited anxiously to see if
the ball would clear the fence. Confident that it was a home run, DeSimone inadvertently passed Goodwin on the base
paths. Goodwin was waiting to see if the ball was going to be caught so he could tag up. As
the ball cleared the fence, the crowd went wild. Unfortunately for the Wildcats, the umpire called DeSimone out and only
two runs crossed the plate. This mental lapse proved to be very costly as Coley O’Donnell tied the game at
four with a two-run homer to shallow right field off Bowers. Later, Goodwin preserved the tie when he made a
diving catch at the warning track. Still, had DeSimone’s run counted, Davidson would have won 5-4. Instead, the game went
to extra innings after a Wildcat rally failed in the top of the seventh. With one out, DeSimone reached first
on a throwing error by Friar third-baseman Angelo Ciminiello. Making a heads-up decision, DeSimone advanced to second. As Providence intentionally
walked Marshall Tyler, Davidson surprised the Friars by having DeSimone steal third. Providence’s pitcher, Mike Stuart, ended the threat by
getting the next two batters. Bowers had been relieved with two outs in the top of the seventh by DeSimone.
In the top of the eighth, Providence’s Keith Reed opened the inning with a single. DeSimone came back by striking
out O’Donnell. Paul Costello came to the plate next. Already with an RBI on the day, Costello homered to left-center
putting the Friars up 6-4. The Wildcats would not concede defeat. Sophomore catcher Chris Cox was clutch as he came
up with his first hit of the season. He was followed by Dom Talvacchio, pinch-hitting for Drew Williams. Talvacchio also
singled. Ben Brown loaded the bases on a perfect bunt base hit. The tension mounted as Mike DeSimone stepped to
the plate with the bases loaded and two outs. This was his chance to go from goat to hero. He
made the most of his opportunity as he ripped a single to left field. Two runs scored, and the game
was tied. The next batter, Marshall Tyler, continued his hot hitting as he won the game by driving home Brown
on a single. DeSimone and Tyler accounted for all seven RBIs in the game. Fittingly, DeSimone was the winning pitcher.

In the first game on Saturday, Providence’s ace pitcher, Marc DesRoches, managed to hold the Cats to one run on
four hits. This was their lowest offensive output of the season. DesRoches showed great control as he pitched a complete
game surrendering only one walk and earning six strikeouts. The only inning he struggled in was the bottom of the
first. He gave up a lead-off double to Ben Brown. With two outs, Marshall Tyler singled Brown home giving Davidson
a 1-0 advantage. The only other hits for Davidson were a double by Stewart Sloan in the second, and a
Dom Talvacchio single in the fifth. After getting the Friars to go one-two-three in the first, Davidson starter, Wes Self
faced trouble in the second. In his first at-bat of the season, Providence right fielder Keith Reed crushed the ball
for a home run. Providence scored two more the next inning when catcher Scott Friedholm singled home both Jason Hairston
and Bryan Tamul. The Friars added one more in the fifth when Hairston scored on an Angelo Ciminiello sacrifice fly
to left field. While Davidson struggled at the plate in game one, they played well defensively. The most notable play
came in the seventh when Drew Williams made a great over-the-shoulder catch, saving a definite run.

The rubber game of the series was easily won by Providence 13-3. Coming off his excellent debut, freshman Ryan Stroker
only lasted four and a third innings against the Friars. Providence jumped out to an early 8-1 lead as Stroker
gave up eight runs on eight hits. Stroker was not helped by his defense as there were three errors. As
a result, he only gave up three earned runs. The other Wildcat pitchers didn’t fare much better. Providence’s Scott Friedholm
homered, as did Keith Reed. For Davidson, Luke Goodwin hit his first home run of the season. On Sunday, Goodwin
went 3-5, with all three of Davidson’s RBIs. Marshall Tyler had a good day at the plate going 2-5. Also,
freshman Tom McGintee had a strong showing in his first start. He had a single and a double, and he
scored a run. Davidson will try to rebound when they play next at home on Wednesday against Winthrop at 3:00.
