LITERARY NEWS

The subject for debate last Saturday night was the eight-hour law. The affirmative said it would help the American people
socially, mentally, and physically. The negative replied by arguing that it would only benefit the railroad men and not the
country. On the whole, the debate was tiresome, lacking pep. W. W. Moore opened the “query” for the affirmative. His
speech was well prepared but was full of big words which he had great difficulty in pronouncing. He was followed
by the Alabama orator whose constant reference to his home state showed that he was at least acquainted with what
is going on in one section of the country. Craig wound up the debate with a quickly gotten up speech.
Heizer, in his oration, endeavored to enlighten his audience as to the Plumb Plan for the railroads. In the absence
of the regular reviewer, Mitchell acted in that stead. His criticisms were good but lacked brevity. A. P. Fraser, an
old Eu. man, spoke a few words to the society, after which it was adjourned.
