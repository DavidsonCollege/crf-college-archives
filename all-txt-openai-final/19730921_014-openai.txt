Positions on the student lift Union Adds Soc

By CHARLES KENNON
Staff Writer

The Davidson College Union has several projects that should add a new dimension to the Davidson social scene. These range
from a big show for Homecoming to a renovated bar in the basement of the Union.

College Union President Joe Earle stated, “We have a lot of good ideas for Homecoming, but there are still some
contracts to be settled.” He added that one of the acts would be “The Proposition,” a comedy team similar to
“The Ace Trucking Company,” but with more experience. Earle stated that the Homecoming concert would be “Muddy Waters.” He added
that Ellen Kearney is performing in the Hungry I this weekend.

“The Union has two parts to its program. These are the social and the co-curricular.” The main social event now
is the facilities offered by the new bar. Earle stated that “the bar this year is being radically altered in
the interest of providing the students a place for Rest and Relaxation.” Chairman of the Union Bar Lenny Vincent said
that the bar hadn’t cost anything for the new color TV. Of concern is that plans to move out of
the building at the start of the school year. According to Vincent this puts the Union in a bind. “We
want a pleasant, inexpensive motif. But at the same time it can’t be too cheap. Right now I am looking
for some old black and white posters, and we’ll welcome donations,” he said.

The Union hopes to provide free beer on nights such as Monday night. “The bar can be a place to
go in and raise hell or be a quiet place to relax. It will depend on the crowd, and we
won’t try to push it one way or the other,” Vincent said.

On a higher cultural level is the co-curricular aspect of the Union. Committees plan events throughout the year to appeal
to various interests of students. Hopefully, the program will interest students in new fields. The mainstay of the co-curricular program
is a series of lectures throughout the year. Earle expressed pleasure with the speakers coming to Davidson this year.
