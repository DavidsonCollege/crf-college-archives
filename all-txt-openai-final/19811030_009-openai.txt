THE DAVIDSONIAN.

POST OFFICE BOX 218, DAVIDSON, NORTH CAROLINA 28036

Circa 1860 Davidson College commissioned J.W. Orr, a New York engraver, to make a woodcut of the first Chambers building.
Although Orr’s original has been lost, a few pieces of stationery on which the woodcut adorned the letterhead have been
preserved. This facsimile of the Orr letterhead was made from a letter written by J.M. Potts on 1 August 1863.
Louis Orr, a descendent of J.W. Orr, made the contemporary series of etchings of North Carolina scenes that hang on
the main floor of the E.H. Little Library.

Subscriptions cost 10. per year within the United States and its possessions; 14. per year elsewhere in North America; 20.
