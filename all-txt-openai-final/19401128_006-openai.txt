Echoes Of The Past

Paul S. Crane, a member of the Davidson Student Body, attended the International Relations Conference held at the Woman's College of the University of North Carolina last weekend, as a Davidson delegate. All foreign students attending southern colleges and universities were invited to attend, eight foreign countries being represented. This conference is held yearly under the auspices of the YWCA at W.C.U.N.C.

The principal speaker at this conference was Luther Tucker, who is the co-chairman of the Christian Student Association of America. The topic of this conference was “International Good Will and the Building of a New Nation After the War.”

Reports concerning the soft drink cooler which was installed in the “Y” last week are very gratifying. The cooler is located in the hall within easy reach of all whose thirst needs quenching. “There has long been a need for some such arrangement to satisfy the needs of the men after a close game of pool, a fast game of ping pong, listening to a ‘hot bull session,’ or reading a good story from the numerous supply of magazines to be found in the reading room,” said Shaw Smith.

Though the cooler is still in the testing stage, plans are being made to replace the small one now in use. Proceeds from the drinks will be used to get some badly needed records for the victrola, to buy several new magazines, and to make general improvements in the playroom and reading room. “The cooler is non-commercial,” stated Smith, “and will be there until the end of the Mid-Year Session. By that time, the editors will be forced to use their own meager powers of discretion in making selections. If additional prints are desired, they can be ordered from the Federal Council of the Churches in North Carolina. Students from all colleges and universities have been invited to participate in this conference without regard to denomination or creed.”
