**The English think all Americans are rich, and other JYA stories from England, Australia, and India**

**By PHILLIP PRESCOTT**

**Larry Dagenhart in England**

I went to Britain knowing what I would be doing but not knowing what to expect. Since I went with
the University of Maryland program, I figured they had probably screened my house mother and taken care of other worries.
As I later found out, she had been boarding students for ten years. I had been abroad before in 1986.
I had spent five weeks in France and Germany, staying in Germany with a German family that were friends of
my family. I was hoping to make some British friends, but it didn’t really happen. The British people are hard
to get to know; you had to know a person for a long time before you became good friends. However,
I did learn more about British culture, and I developed friendships with the Maryland students.

Any aspiring tourist has to realize that Europe is very expensive and people there are often not used to the
services we expect in the States. Often, you don’t save money by purchasing things in quantity. Traveling is great for
a student with an International ID, which gives discounts on the railways, museums, and other tourist attractions. In London, candy
is very inexpensive if you want a bargain present to bring back home. All our traveling was done on our
own; that was one of the great things about the Maryland program. The youth hostels and bed and breakfasts were
the best places to stay. Actually, I took a plane to Paris. You can get some really good deals through
a student tourist office.

Many stereotypes concerning Americans exist among English people. They think that we are all rich. Some English people wish they
could live in America with all its amenities. They like American television, films, and cheaper food. Funny as it seems,
most British can easily spot an American, and you can become somewhat self-conscious. One of my favorite things in London
was the Cabinet War Rooms where Winston Churchill and his staff planned war strategy during World War II. The Tower
of London was also among my favorite sights. Scotland and Ireland possess incredible scenic beauty.

I thought there would be kangaroos in the parks like squirrels, but it’s not like that. You have to go
out of your way to find them. It’s like America was 100 years ago. Capitalism hasn’t sunk in there like
it has in America. I was in Melbourne. I thought it would be much warmer than it actually was, but
it rained a lot. I went with Marymount University, of New York, but nobody in our group was from Marymount.
I was the only person from the South. The others were from California, New York, and elsewhere.

In Australia, there is a big difference between the city and the country. A city person is just like here,
but in the country, there are cowboys like “Crocodile Dundee.” Australians love Americans. They are really excited that others want
to see their country and find out what it’s all about. Classes were not required and there were no exams,
but we did have papers. When I wasn’t traveling, I usually went to the pubs and nightclubs in the city.
One thing about Australia is people are always on strike. The buses and trains were almost always on strike at
least one day a week. The trains are definitely the way to travel. I traveled 5000 miles for $200 on
a ticket with unlimited stops. Australia is so spread out that you really need 24 hours to reach the next
big city.

The most impressive thing I saw was the Great Barrier Reef. It’s amazing: 2,500 miles of many colors with sharks
and turtles swimming in it. One place to stay, especially if you’re budget-minded, is a backpacker’s place. For about $6
a night, you get a bed in a communal room. However, you get no privacy. It worked out well that
my host mother was a biology teacher at the University of Melbourne. I told her I was wondering if there
was an island to scuba dive off of for a week. She knew of Harrin Island off the barrier reef
where many biology students do research. I went to the island and brought two friends with me. They didn’t have
any research, so we worked only nine hours over six days. I also visited Ayers Rock, which the aborigines used
to think was the center of the universe before the white man came. It’s the biggest rock in the world.as
big as a mountain, and you can climb it. I also went to China for 8 days and 7 nights.
It was a $750 student travel deal which included round-trip airfare from Australia and a four-star hotel, as well as
some of the best restaurants and most of the tourist attractions. When I went to China, it was the 100th
day anniversary of the student massacre. The country was under martial law, but it wasn’t how we would envision it.
No curfew was enforced. Only the army and tourists were allowed in Tiananmen Square. When we went to the square,
we were made to sign a consent form that we wouldn't tell anyone about what we saw. However, our tour
guide was at the massacre and asked what we thought about the incident. The Chinese generally like Americans, especially those
that are tall. The person I traveled with was tall and weighed 250 pounds. They got a big — See

Davidson starts its own version of “networking”
By GIRISH GVALANI

Those of us who were around last year probably remember some workmen digging over a period of a few autumn
afternoons in front of Chambers. That was the innocuous start of an operation that culminated quietly this winter just before
we all returned: the installation and debugging of Decnet, the Davidson Computer Network.

The latest achievement of the Computer Services in this regard has been to successfully put into operation a classroom in
Chambers specifically designed for those classes which stress (no pun intended) the application of computers in their curriculum. Four-letter words
are bad enough; eight-letter words like computer are worse still. But strangely enough the NCR, as it is called, will
not be such an ogre as we may imagine it to be, according to informed sources. For one thing, it
is hooked up to Decnet.

What’s so special about Decnet? For starters, it eliminates the need to develop ulcers when your computer screams “Put WordPerfect
2 Diskette back in Drive A,” speeds up your work hugely, allows you to print in any one of two
networked locations on campus from a single terminal, or as a matter of fact, print on any one of seven
networked printers across campus, including two Laser Printers from any one of 40 networked terminals around campus. Interested? There’s more.
It allows students access to the campus electronic mail system as well as to electronic mail systems at other colleges
via Bitnet.

A word about Bitnet. It allows you to connect to over two thousand locations worldwide, and best of all, at
Davidson it’s free! To those privileged (or cursed, whichever way we see it) few who actually enjoy computing, there is
software and loads of it available on the Network, anytime, anywhere. WordPerfect, Turbo Pascal, Turbo C, Assembler, Debugger, Norton’s Utilities,
MathCad, MPP, MatrixPad, ODE, IAPL, and Quattro are just a few to get your hands on. Those of us who
know what it is to suffer agonies when our diskette runs out of room for the file we must save
will surely appreciate the fact that Decnet makes it possible for the student to now store 1.4 Megabytes of WordPerfect
or Quattro files or about 140 six-page papers through the Network in their VAX accounts. More than enough for one
semester.

All this is available in the NCR. Best of all, it is all in English in Menus, which ask you
to select options before you start working on your paper. So you don’t need to be able to read Sanskrit
or know what a SIMM, DRAM, or CHIP is to get the most out of Decnet.

The NCR has much to offer for professors as well. Members of the faculty who have already started using the
NCR include Richard Neidinger and Bruce Jackson, professors of mathematics; and David Martin, professor of economics. Some who anticipate using
it later this semester are Mary Thornberry, professor of political science; Glenn C. Lindsey, professor of economics; and Zoran Kuzmanovich,
professor of English. Each of them has innovative plans as to how he or she will use the NCR to
enrich the quality of the course they teach, but they all agree that exposing the college student to the applications
and importance of computers in today’s world is their main objective.

According to Sue Varga-Ward, the Director of Academic Computing at the CSC, another often-overlooked yet extremely important advantage of the
NCR is that it offers the faculty and the student body at Davidson an opportunity to enjoy the advantages of
a Mainframe Computer, an opportunity presently available to very few even in the U.S.A.

To learn how to get the most out of the network, participate in one of the “Intro to the Network”
workshops sponsored by the Computer Services. To sign up, call 2402.
