It will be extremely inconvenient
to be ill this summer, as the infirmary is closed. However, if one finds
it necessary to become sick, he should
do so between the hours of 9:30-12:30
in the morning and 2:30-5:00 in the
afternoon, for those are Dr. Woods'
office hours. The doctor's office is
located in the second house beyond
Reid's Esso Station, toward the
Junior High School.
Of course, in case of an emergency,
Dr. Woods will be available at his
home during the night.

= ENROLLMENT REACHES 186

If the information we received
from the registrar's office is correct (and we have no reason to doubt
it), 186 fortunate college students
are presently having the privilege
of furthering their academic and
social training here at good ole
D.C.'s SUMMER SCHOOL. Among this
number are six coeds! (Yes, that's
right, I said SIX).

For those who might be interested,
the young ladies are: Miss Eleanor
Adams, Wesleyan; Miss Jane Hoke, WC;
Misses Marilyn Messerly and Lacy
Woods, Randolph-Macon; Miss Bobbi
Shelton, Stetson; Mrs. Betty Young,
Mooresville. (I don't think this is a
college).

About 45 students are taking
science courses, while the remaining
140 are enrolled in the Department
of Diversified Conversation and
Unrelated Information.

As stated by the SUMMER SCHOOL
catalog, "the summer, like the winter,
offers opportunities for leisure time
activities on the campus and in
nearby Charlotte." Also, many pleasant
hours can be whiled away at the friendly
taverns in neighboring Iredell
County.

STUDENT COUNCIL HEAD

It is my pleasure to welcome each
of you to the Davidson campus for
the summer session.

A particular welcome is extended
to those of you who are on the hill
for the first time. I hope that your
experience at Davidson will be as
pleasant as possible and that you
will profit both academically and
spiritually.

The student council acts as your
representative body. As such it is
interested in your problems and your
concerns. Your suggestions and criticisms are always welcome for a
better Davidson. It shall be our task
to have the best possible study and
living conditions for all.

I urge each person to remember
that the Honor System remains one of
the foundation stones of Davidson
life. It works here at Davidson because each student believes in its
tenets and makes it work. The principles on which it is based are those
which serve as building blocks of
character and so in making them your
own you will help to make yourself a
better person.

The emphasis of Davidson College
has traditionally been three-fold:
intellectual growth, spiritual growth,
and physical growth. It is our hope
that you will find opportunity for
participating in each of these during
the next weeks.

If I or the council can aid you
in our representative capacities,
please let us do so.

RETURN OF THE NATIVE

Miss Percy Whittle, a recent
graduate of Queens College, has
replaced Miss Lucy Copeland as
Secretary to Mr. Shaw Smith. Percy

coach, Mr. Heath Whittle. Let's
all welcome her to our midst.

Hi, Peggy!
