**Stairwell physicists astound Davidson science staff**

By BILL SCOUTEN

The research capability of Davidson’s sciences has often come into question. However, recent activity has been recognized, suggesting a new
direction taken in the research of the physics department. Despite the popular belief that Davidson College is interested only in
optical physics, specifically the use of the laser and its applications, a recent development has pointed to the renewed interest
in the gravitational force.

Gravity as we know it today has evolved from a rather primitive view to a quite advanced view. In fact,
our knowledge of gravity comes from the ancient Greeks who laid the foundation for the work of two great physicists,
Newton and Einstein, in addition to the revealing study of Galileo.

Galileo, in his alleged “God-less” experiments, showed that the earth produced a constant downward acceleration, and that this acceleration is
independent of the bulk or composition of the falling body. He was consequently excommunicated and incarcerated for such blasphemy.

Newton, working years after Galileo, experienced gravity through the apple. Unfortunately, it is rumored that the apple was mealy and
thoroughly unpleasing. Nevertheless, Newton’s stomach churned and his mind gave birth to a veritable plethora of theories and formulas which
plague physics students of today.

Einstein also found himself intrigued by the thought of gravity and, in a fit of divination, formulated what was soon
to be called the theory of relativity. From this point on in time, gravity has seen little or no attention
due to the overwhelming curiosity of physicists concerning superconductors and black holes.

Presently, however, Davidson is seeing a revival of interest in the study of gravitational phenomena, especially the fourth force.

“I am amazed,” commented one physics major, “I didn’t know that so many were interested in gravity.”

It’s not just the physics majors, though. The entire Davidson staff is utterly boggled by the spontaneous research effort.

It seems that students line up to test not only far-fetched theories of a supposed fourth force, but line up
to satisfy their own curiosity, prove to themselves that F=mg is correct. Seemingly sparked by the ingenious lectures and teaching
methods of the physics department, headed by Dr. Wolf, students use weekends to further their knowledge.

The astonishment doesn’t end with...

It was once thought that the student research teams were using Davidson’s equipment to carry out the study. However, it
has been shown that the instrumentation used is home-made.

With a whoop, a chair is let fall. A jug of water is released. Various articles of trash plummet down.
Perhaps a trash can accelerates downward. Bicycles, typewriters, bottles, cans, anything that can fall will fall.

A cry signifies the end of the flight of four stories. Landing with a “squish” or “splat,” the objects are
left for other groups to observe. This practice has led, however, to complaints from students of other research groups, innocent
bystanders, and faculty.

“As much as I respect the research fervor of these student research teams, the cleanliness of the public domain must
be respected.” The complaints are many, and with good reason.

The public domain must be kept passable, free of impediments, clutter. Waking up Saturday morning to the pile of garbage
at the bottom of Belk’s center stairwell is enough to sicken many. The stench, the slime, the layers of garbage,
bed frames, and articles of clothing are uncalled for. With respect for others’ safety, health, and general easy breathing, it
is advisable that all experiments are cleaned up. In fact, a new group has been called together: the SLOBS (Students
Lobbying fOr Belk Sanitation). This group has been formed with the intent of enforcing the suggested “clean research act.” In
this capacity, members will endeavor to investigate all violations with probable penal action.

Cleanliness of the dorm is mandatory. Dorm life is more enjoyable in a clean environment. As for the experiments, do
not be misled. Learning is imperative, and research is a great addition to knowledge gleaned in the classroom. However, as
one of those who prizes the luxury of dorm life and its general proximity to the college proper, I suggest
that respect be shown to all.

**FOR THAT SPECIAL VALENTINE**

**ARMY RESERVE OFFICERS TRAINING CORPS**

Even if you didn’t start college on a scholarship, you could finish on one. Army ROTC Scholarships make college easier.
Just easier to pay for.

Army ROTC Scholarships pay for full tuition and allowances for educational fees and textbooks. Along with up to $1,000 a
year. Get all the facts.
