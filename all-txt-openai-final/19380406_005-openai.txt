**Question of the Week**

The question put before students this week is not one of burning and immediate importance, perhaps, but it is one
of virtually universal interest. And, surprising as it may seem, for once individuals questioned seemed pretty well satisfied with things
as they are concerning the subject under discussion. In short, the query was: “What do you think of the eating
arrangements as they concern the undergraduate at Davidson?”

**Davidson’s Official Hosts**

**Howard Arbuckle Talks Before Student Group**

**Church Group Seeks Change**

**Prominent Lawyer Addresses Students Interested in His Profession**

Howard Arbuckle, Jr., prominent Charlotte attorney and son of Dr. Howard Arbuckle, former professor of chemistry at Davidson College, spoke
last night in the faculty room to students planning to enter the legal profession. Arbuckle’s address, part of a vocational
guidance series being conducted under the combined auspices of the Administration and the Y.M.C.A., elaborated on the boarding house system
as practiced here. He discussed whether Davidson College, as many larger and smaller institutions operate, should have one large “common”
or “mess hall,” or what-have-you, to feed its hungry mouths. Do you feel that any change is needed in the
system here?

Incidentally, the Davidson student, reticent as he may be on some topics, often waxes loquacious when food is mentioned. It's
evidently a subject very near his heart and one to which he gives quite a bit of thought.

At any rate, here are the opinions of those interviewed on the way Davidson should be fed:

**Mark Lillard, Junior:**

On the whole, I think the food situation is all right — what we get is good and helpful. I
think the present system is fine. The unifying effect of the boarding houses brings the boys together in a social
way that couldn't be possible at a school cafeteria. Comparing the prices with those quoted in other schools, I think
we are getting a good deal.

**Digest Will Print Work Of Readers**

**Brown Section Will Devote Entire Issue to Students’ Snapshots**

Collegiate Digest, the rotogravure section of the Davidsonian, has announced that it will devote its second issue in May to
a presentation of the best work of student and faculty photographers. It is to be called the Salon Edition, and
will be a means of showing to its readers the accomplishments of the members of the college camera clubs throughout
the nation.

For this special edition, the newspaper will select two to three prints in each of the divisions listed in the
contest rules, with cash awards of five dollars for the best prints. The following are the contest rules:

1. All material must reach us not later than Thursday, April 14, addressed to Collegiate Digest, Suite 6, Sexton Building,
Minneapolis, Minnesota.
2. Send technical data about each photo submitted, and give the college year or faculty standing of the photographer.
3. There is no entry fee. Photos will be returned if requested.

**K.A.’s Install New Officers**

The Beaver Club has been recently reorganized by Fred Smith. This club has as its purpose the entertaining of visiting
teams and other guests, and they are Davidson's official hosts. The club is made up of about twenty boys, representing
various groups on the campus. These men have been chosen in view of their capability in meeting and entertaining strangers.
Wilkerson, who presided, explained the purpose of the meeting, which was to promote a more friendly attitude among the students
and to discuss ways to make the church service more attractive to boys.

**Davidson Alumnus Discusses Problems**

In his speech last night, Arbuckle discussed the various problems in the legal profession. He advised the prospective lawyers as
to the preparatory courses they should attempt to complete, and answered several questions concerning law work asked by students.

**Betas Take Charge**

New Officers of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity were installed at the last meeting. The officers for the coming year
are: President, John Doe; Vice-President, Richard Roe; Secretary, James Smith; Treasurer, William Brown.

Davidson College Sunday School on “Men Who Hazard Their Lives For Christ.” Dr. Grubb, having been a missionary to the
Belgian Congo, used his own life as an example for his talk. The visiting Englishman, author of several books on
Christian life, traced his own spiritual journey and his full acceptance of Christ when he was nineteen years old. “When
you feel the definite assurance that your sins are completely blotted out, then you may know that you are a
full believer in Christ,” said Dr. Grubb. However, beyond even this, said the speaker, is the time when you are
able to overcome human selfishness and dedicate your will wholly to Christ. In telling of this experience in his own
life, he said that he was forced to break away from several companions and social habits, and also give up
any dependence on working as a means of living, and simply trust that God would provide for him. Dr. Grubb
concluded by urging that full acceptance of Christ be taken as a starting point for the Christian life and then
that later the good Christian should put his will entirely in the hands of God.

Jim Anderson, Sophomore: I think ours are reasonable enough. From what I’ve seen of other schools, our way is as
good as any. Still, the food could be better, of course. I’m definitely not in favor of any common eating
place here. A school cafeteria has its advantages, of course, but for one thing: the breaking up of the fraternity
boarding arrangements would be a great blow to fraternity spirit. A big improvement, however, would be to establish some co-operative
meat and grocery buying concern for the benefit of the boarding houses. A more practical suggestion might be for the
managers and heads of the different places to exchange visits and compare notes.

Warren Ludlam, Sophomore: I think the boarding house system is best of all, though not perfect, of course. It gives
a boy a chance to choose; if he doesn’t like it where he is, he can leave. Private dining rooms,
having no competition, are not apt to hold to a high standard. Costs might be cut here, though, by more
efficient buying for the boarding houses.

Chubby King, Sophomore: I think ours are calorically inadequate — except where I work. Kidding aside, I would like to
see a cafeteria on campus — would certainly mean cheaper rates, leisurely meals, and possibly better food. Maybe too, a
spot for another orchestra.

The new officers were installed last Thursday night. They are: President, Tul Scroggs; Vice President, Ed Morrow; Secretary, Sammy Walker;
Corresponding Secretary, Vale McClintock; Alumni Secretary, Bob Ramsey. Dick Vowles attended the ODK convention at Columbia, S.C. Ray Brown went
to the ODK convention at Columbia, S.C. last Thursday night. They are: President, Tul Scroggs; Vice President, Ed Morrow; Secretary,
Sammy Walker; Corresponding Secretary, Vale McClintock; Alumni Secretary, Bob Ramsey.

At the weekly meeting on last Thursday, the local Phi Gam chapter elected officers for the coming year. They are:
Fred Stair, President; Gene Liipfert, Secretary; Rut Miller, Corresponding Secretary; Henry Baker, Historian. Gene Liipfert was also chosen Pan-Hellenic representative.
Jim Anderson and Bub Coltrane went to Gainesville, Ga., to a dance at Brenau. Teeney Lafferty and Vernon Youngblood went
to their homes in Concord. Joe Shelton spent the weekend at his home in Statesville. “Ace” Parker journeyed to Lynchburg,
Va. Miss Sis Sample, of Queens-Chicora, visited her brother, Jim, here. Brother Fitzhugh Dade is reported sick in Miami, Fla.,
with influenza. Brothers Charlie Smith, Pete Marchant, and Tom Hackney spent an unusually quiet weekend. Jim Reinhardt and Lloyd Feuquay
spent the weekend in Charlotte. Bobby Gish will represent the chapter on the Pan-Hellenic Council next year, while Ken Lawson
will be Epsilon’s delegate to the national convention next August at Jacksonville, Fla. Last Saturday’s races lured “Booby” Arrowsmith, Ken
Lawson, Bill McLean, Sonny Cunningham, Paul Cooper, and Dick Towill to Camden, the last named four continuing to Charleston for
a visit.

The regular Sunday night feed was held last Sunday night. The most comfortable and sensible suits for service like the
one that’s the size of a specimen you are from it. You can get better food that way. And, too,
the visiting Englishman, author of several books on Christian life, traced his own spiritual life and his full acceptance of
Christ when he was nineteen years old. “When you feel the definite assurance that your sins are completely blotted out,
then you may know that you are a full believer in Christ,” said Dr. Grubb. However, beyond even this, said
