**Union finances show befuddling balancing**

While Director of the College Union C. Shaw Smith claims that “The Union’s financial records have always been open and
in order,” Smith has not always promptly reimbursed the College for his past travel expenses. The most recent reimbursement for
Smith’s travel expenses was received by Comptroller Robert Davidson a few weeks ago. Smith’s reimbursement check to the College totaled
$1200.

“Shaw Smith was pretty late on his payment. Reimbursements should be made within 60 days of the day on which
the staff member completes his trip,” said Davidson. “Of the $1200 which Smith owed and just recently paid, at least
one part of that amount—a bill totaling $300 in air fares—should have been paid months ago, back in October or
November,” said Davidson. The comptroller made payment on Smith’s $300 check on October 15, 1974. “Smith should have paid for
some of his air travel expenses much earlier than he did.”

“Apparently Shaw does not submit his requests for reimbursements from the American College Union-International (ACU-I) early enough,” commented Davidson. Smith
took several trips across the United States this year in order to attend meetings of the ACU-I, an organization of
which he is president.

Union Board President Richard Wassen has asked that a separate traveling expense account be set up for Smith. “I see
no problem with doing this. I’ve already suggested to Shaw that some changes be made. He ought to run his
traveling expenses for non-Davidson College Union activities through the #4300 series, which we can control here and which he can’t
exceed. He should tap the #4300 series for his travel expenses rather than the Student Social fee account (#2110), which
funds many non-travel activities” (e.g., “The River Niger,” guest speakers, bands), advised Davidson.

One administrative official admitted that if Smith wanted to exceed the travel expense limit which is made available to him
through the #4300 series, he could charge his travel expenses to various sub-committees of the Social Committee or the Co-Curricular
Council of the Union. In other words, “there can be no bureaucratic check of Smith’s traveling budget unless a system
is devised in which all checks or invoices leaving the Union are signed by at least one other person along
with Shaw,” said one administrative official.

In 1966, various Union representatives were authorized to counter-sign Union checks. “This system was discontinued when it became clear to
everyone that the students were not able to responsibly carry out these financial duties,” said Smith. “I, too, believe we
can blame students from past years for not taking a responsible approach to these matters.”

The Campus Tax Council submitted to the SGA Senate a $50,000 budget, allocating monies from the student activities fee to
ten campus organizations. The Senate confirmed this budget Tuesday. The Campus Tax Council has the job of distributing the $40
which each student pays as an activities fee to various college groups and publications, including Quips n’ Cranks, WDAV, The
Miscellany, the Senate, the Black Student Coalition, and The Davidsonian.

The Davidsonian, WDAV, and Quips n’ Cranks each received $2000 budget increases. The SGA Senate will operate on a significantly
reduced budget, down $5450 from last year. “We had $50,010 to distribute among 10 groups. These groups asked for $55,000
collectively, so we had to trim the budget,” said a member of the Student Activities Fee Committee.

3) total of $5000,” said Campus Tax Council Chairman Bo Hunter. The group retained $7000 for unexpected expenses. The money
will earn six to seven percent interest. The Davidsonian requested $3500 more than last year, due partly to increased costs
of newsprint and printing. Editor Mark Deaton told the council that he hopes to purchase an offset computer this year
to reduce printing costs and make the campus publications more financially independent.

“We approved very strongly of The Davidsonian’s attempt to buy this machine,” Hunter said. “We granted them $12,400, almost $2000
more than last year,” he added. Deaton expressed mild disappointment that The Davidsonian’s full budget request was not met. “Students
aren’t getting their dollar’s worth for campus publications now, and they won’t until we are able to purchase necessary printing
equipment. This equipment could be used by all student publications.

“Leaving us $2000 short of our request is really going to make life difficult for us. But if we can
operate on a shoe-string next year after the purchase of some costly equipment, I think all campus publications will be
able to reduce their budget requests in following years,” Deaton said.

The Quips n’ Cranks will receive $12,800 next year, $400 more than The Davidsonian budget. The council also granted WDAV
a large budget increase. Mark Wilensky, station manager, told the campus tax council members that WDAV could improve recording quality
through the purchase of a new cart player. He expected other non-recurring expenses next year.

The SGA Senate was the only organization to request a budget cut for the upcoming school year. The Senate will
no longer fund psychological counseling because the school has assumed that role. “One change that may take place next year
is the funding of the Black Student Coalition. It has been suggested that they be one-half funded by the College
Union and one-half funded through campus tax,” said Hunter. “Many of their activities are social and come more under the
Union,” he said.

One realized change in financing concerned the college Artist Series. The Artist Series brought performers such as PDQ Bach and
William Windom to Davidson. “The college has ceased funding the series, and the Campus Tax Council has attempted to fill
the gap,” said Hunter. The council will give the Artist Series $7000, a $1000 increase over last year.

The Campus Tax Council is composed of six students, one faculty member, and two administrators. Business Manager Robert A. Currie
and College Union Director C. Shaw Smith serve from the administration, and Professor of Mathematics Richard R. Bernard serves from
the faculty. Students include Hunter, Tony Snow, Brad Swalwell, Stephen Barnes, Patti Phillips, and Danny Smith.

“This was a very smooth-running council. Almost everyone was new, but there were no difficulties with personality conflicts,” Hunter said.
“I was pleased with the council this year. The members were very perceptive, and they asked good questions.”

Hunter did see one major fault in the present system. “One improvement that could be made is to have the
council meet in the fall of each year and see how much money the publications and other organizations have spent
up to that point. We also need a closer check on some of the spending,” Hunter maintained.
