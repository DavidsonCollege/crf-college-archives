Activities Tax Council Proposes $223,500 Budget for '93-'94
Allocations to be Submitted to SGA for Approval
By Chris Frampton

This week, the A.T.C. approved a 1993-94 budget with $223,500 worth of funds to be divided among student-run campus organizations.
As a branch of the SGA, the council must now send the budget to the Senate for final approval.

The Activities Tax Council, according to Chairman Jason Bertsch, is mandated by the SGA to “allocate and supervise the use
of student activity fees collected in the comprehensive tuition bill.” Funds are received by many SGA chartered organizations, including publications,
club sports, F.L.A.G., and the Environmental Action Committee.

Comprised of Chairman Bertsch, Vice-Chairman Rachel Worlds, College Controller Ed Cania, Dean of Students Will Terry, Union Director William Brown,
and five members of the student body, the committee met last week with all groups petitioning for money from the
fund. After each meeting, the council then debated the proposed budget and allocated an amount to be submitted to the
entire SGA. Budget allocations ranged from the $130,000 proposed for the Union to the $300 for the Spanish Club.

The $223,500 total budget is an approximation from the estimated 1,490 students expected to attend Davidson next year, each paying
a $150 activities tax. The fee itself has increased in past years, up $20 from last year’s $130. Effective for
the 1994-95 year, it will be set at one percent of the total tuition.

Although the entire budget must be formally approved by the entire SGA, the process usually includes little debate, since the
ATC oversees each budget very carefully. Bertsch noted, “The ATC had a difficult job in making decisions about allocations, but
I believe we fulfilled our goals and purpose in allocating funds in a prudent and fair manner.”

Honor Council Elects New Officers
Plans Already Being Made for Next Year's Committee
By Alice Felmlee

On Wednesday, April 14th the Honor Council selected a new chairman and secretary for the 1993-’94 school year. In a
silent vote, Ward Davis, a rising senior, was elected to replace Matt Bumstead as chair. Sally Stone, also a rising
senior, was elected secretary, and will assume Catherine Milligan’s duties in the fall.

The Honor Council elections, which took place in Phi Hall, began with positive discussion about each of the candidates, who
at this time left the room, and concluded with a silent vote amongst the remaining members of the council. While
all of the thirty members of the Honor Council are encouraged to run for one of these positions, both Davis
and Stone entered the elections with the most experience.

When taking her seat in the fall, Stone will bring with her many hopes and plans. She commented, “I look
forward to working with Ward for a productive and educational year.” Current Chair, Matt Bumstead, commented when assessing the year,
“We have done more this year to improve the system than in any year since I have been here, but
there are still many changes which need to be made.” Looking towards next year, he commented on the need for
better communication between the student body and the Honor Council in addition to better clarity on the rules governing confidentiality.
“Ward and Sally are the best people for the job. They will work hard to accomplish these goals and others,”
he said.

JET Selects Milliganand Orta to Teach
By Chris Hood

Two Davidson seniors, Catherine Milligan and Michael Orta, have been selected to participate in the Japan Exchange and Teaching (JET)
Program beginning this summer. As Assistant Language Teachers (ALTs), they will work for a two-year period in a Japanese city.
Duties should include helping train prospective English teachers, along with providing guidance in preparation for and methods of teaching the
language to Japanese public school students.

Milligan and Orta submitted applications before Christmas; after passing the “initial screening” process, they were interviewed for the positions in
February. Approximately 3,000 men and women from nine countries were notified of their acceptances by the end of March. Each
is looking forward to the experience largely because of the cultural advantages and differences they will encounter in Japan.

“It’s one thing to know the language, but without an understanding of the culture, you’re still at a standstill,” Orta
said. “I really want to go off and do something on my own without being overwhelmed by responsibilities,” Milligan stated.
“The JET Program really fits in, and it will be a great cultural experience.” Both also felt quite confident after
their interview sessions. Through extensive preparation and tips from friends familiar with Japanese culture, they obtained a more complete indication
of what would likely be expected of them if accepted.

Milligan and Orta will be told in which cities they will be teaching for the two-year program within the next
couple of weeks; they will begin working in the second half of July.
