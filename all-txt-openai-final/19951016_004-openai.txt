DC sponsoring, building Habitat House
By Sarayn J. DAMANTI

A committee of students and staff met last Tuesday evening to plan how people on this campus can do the same thing for another family. The new “Habitat House Committee,” chaired by Smita Donthamsetty and service coordinator Catherine Turner, accepted the ambitious task of raising $30,000-$40,000 and completing construction of a Habitat house here in Davidson by the end of the school year.

The home will be constructed on Potts Street, which is just a five-minute walk from campus across the railroad tracks from Town Hall. Habitat has built 11 other homes there since a chapter was founded here in 1988. The family who will live in the home will be selected through the Our Towns Habitat chapter, which builds homes in Mooresville, Davidson, Cornelius, and Huntersville. Families are accepted to receive Habitat homes on the basis of their poor or overcrowded living conditions, ability to handle financial matters, stable job history, and lack of a criminal record. They must also subscribe to the Habitat concept by working on their home and other Habitat homes for 300 hours.

By using volunteer labor and as much donated material as possible, Habitat can build a three-bedroom, two-bath home for about $30,000. It is even more affordable to homeowners because they buy it from Habitat through a 20-year, no-interest mortgage. Most end up paying less to own a home than they were paying in rent, since their monthly mortgage payment is about $225, including escrow fees. Habitat believes that home ownership builds community by giving families a sense of pride and a stake in the community’s welfare.

The Davidson Habitat committee plans to meet every other Monday to maintain impetus for the project. “I am very excited about the project,” said publicity co-chair Sandy Neblett. “It is potentially a very unifying project. It will be one of the first projects where the whole campus is involved.” Everyone is encouraged to become involved in the event, and many groups have already agreed to help with fundraising. On October 21, Kappa Sigma fraternity and Rusk eating house will sponsor “Homeruns for Habitat,” a softball tournament which will raise funds through pledges and sale of t-shirts. Other fundraising activities will include the student talent show.

Boyd makes a speedy recovery

After donating bone marrow on September 29, junior Brian Boyd bounced right back into action. After all, “I needed to go back to class. I had a paper due on Monday.”

The operation to retrieve bone marrow takes 45-90 minutes on average. Because Brian’s blood marrow was “exceptionally dilute,” it took his doctors about two-and-a-half hours to finish the surgery. Brian felt serious pain for about 20 minutes after waking up. As he explained, however, “that was only because I didn’t ask for the pain reliever. That was stupid!” After that period, he felt “just uncomfortable” at worst.

Brian left the hospital at 6 p.m. that evening and went back to a friend’s room to watch a movie. By Monday, his life went back to business as usual. He spent his fall break with a visiting friend, “sitting around here and vegging out.”

Cautiously optimistic, Brian will soon be able to communicate through anonymous letters with his recipient. He knows now that she is divorced with three children. In his letters, he must be careful not to reveal where or who he is. In about a month, Brian will know whether or not her transplant was successfully received.days and Mondays. FLAG fashion show and the offerings taken up during the Chapel Committee’s Christmas Vespers. The Habitat House Committee will also consider events such as concerts and parties. So far, $270 have been placed into the treasury. Treasurer William Brown, director of the College Union, is very optimistic about the project. “I think it’s exciting, and it’s definitely going to happen,” he said. Turner added, “If everyone on campus gave only $20 to the cause, we would have enough money,” she said. “That is not a lot of funds per person when it will be used to build new and better lives.”

Volunteer coordinator co-chair and Bonner Scholars program director Katherine Cooke said there will be many opportunities for student involvement in the project. “Though students have helped on other Habitat houses, this is the first time in Davidson that a house will be built solely by college students,” she said. “We will need lots of help with the building as well as volunteer support to bring food and drinks for the workers.” The foundation for the house will be poured before Christmas, and construction will proceed after winter break. Construction is tentatively scheduled for Thursdays and Saturdays. Anyone who wants to volunteer, groups who would like to work with the project, or any person who has ideas about fundraising or other aspects of the event should contact Donthamsetty at x6730 or Turner at x2460.

Habitat for Humanity has helped more than 40,000 families across the US to break out of the poverty cycle by achieving the American dream of home ownership.

In observance of National Depression Screening Day, the Student Health Center hosted a seminar Thursday night to promote education and awareness of depression. The seminar included speakers, panelists, and the movie Ordinary People. College counselor DeWitt Crosby and Dr. Coal Barton, a member of the psychology department, opened the evening with a discussion about the signs and causes of clinical depression. Dr. Barton mentioned that “depression becomes a pervasive mood that colors your perspective.” He indicated that depression is primarily a disorder associated with distortions of reality and behavior. Crosby concluded the night on an optimistic note, saying that “depression is a hopeful disease, the most treatable of mental illnesses, [since] 90 percent of those who experience depression get well.”
