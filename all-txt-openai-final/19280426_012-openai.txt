### THE DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 26, 1928

#### “Y” Column

Vesper Services, next Sunday evening, will be conducted by the Junior class, on the lawn back of the “Y” building.
Efforts are being made, however, to secure Gipsy Smith, Jr., who is now conducting an evangelistic meeting in Concord. In
the event that he can be present, the program of the Juniors will be postponed. Mr. Smith is nationally known
as a popular evangelist, and every student should make a special effort to hear him if he consents to hold
the service.

Everyone's attention is called to the booklet, “Why The ‘Y,’” which has recently appeared. Its purpose is to define and
explain the aim of our local organization; it does not attempt to define the policies of the national organization. There
are many phases of the work touched on, and the “Y” feels that it will be of benefit to every
reader. Copies will be sent to each member of the board of trustees and to many leading ministers in the
South. Anyone may secure this booklet at the “Y” room, and the “Y” will be glad to send copies to
special friends of the students if they will leave the names at the office.

Each member of the new “Y” cabinet is rapidly becoming familiar with his duties for the coming year. Every man
is making a conscientious and sincere effort to prepare himself to the best of his ability for the important work
ahead.

In the near future, the old and new cabinets are going on a “Retreat.” They will spend the night in
some seclusive and quiet spot where a consecrative council will be held.

All those who can make use of the “Y” rooms during Junior Week are requested to do so. The “Y”
will be open and will be available.

#### LITERARY SOCIETIES

Tonight at 7:15, the members of each literary society will meet in the Eumenean hall for the annual Fresh-Soph debate
which is sponsored by the two societies. The question for discussion is, “Resolved, That the United States Shall Cease to
Protect by Force of Arms American Capital in Foreign Countries Except After Formal Declaration of War.”

**Eumenean**

“Resolved, That a Five-day Week for Labor Should Be Adopted,” was the question under discussion at the last meeting, April
19th. E. E. Marsh and J. R. Graham won the decision over the negative, which was supported by S. H.
Long and W. Williams. The merits of the question were previously decided by the house in favor of the affirmative.
J. C. Mathews delivered an oration. A motion was passed to contribute seven and a half dollars towards the expense
of Davidson’s representative in the state oratorical contest on the Constitution of the United States, which is to be held
at Duke in the near future.

**Philanthropic**

Debating on the affirmative, W. A. Brown and T. H. Hall won over Crawford and Cromartie, of the negative. The
remainder of the hour was devoted to a discussion of parliamentary law, “Robert's Rules Of Orders” being considered the final
authority. The Philanthropic Society also voted seven and a half dollars towards the expenses of the Davidson representative at Duke.

#### NEW FRAT COUNCIL

The retiring council is: H. B. Arbuckle, president, Pi Kappa Alpha; J. F. McCrary, secretary and treasurer, Kappa Alpha; W.
Beta Theta Pi; W. R. Grey, Kappa Sigma; C. R. Carr, Pi Kappa Phi; M. P. Crawford, Sigma Alpha Epsilon.

#### JIM APPLEBY

Jim Appleby has been of untold help to many men on the campus, advising them, guiding them, always trying to
make life more worthwhile for them. So many watch his departure with not a little sadness, remembering him, above all,
as a friend, companion, and a devout man of God.

G. Pritchett, former University of Tennessee athletic idol and for the past six years director of athletics at Woodberry Forest
School in Virginia, has accepted a position recently offered him by Davidson College athletic officials, and will report here September
1 as professor of physical education and chairman of the Davidson Athletic Committee it was announced today.

The appointment of Mr. Pritchett to the professorship of physical education and to the chairmanship of the Davidson Athletic Committee
followed lengthy negotiations between him and local athletic officials resulting from the approval by the Davidson Board of Trustees of
an enactment providing for the addition of a department of physical education to the college curriculum. His acceptance will in
no wise alter the existing personnel of the coaching staff at Davidson. Coach W. L. Younger will be retained as
director of athletics and head coach, and S. D. Tilson will continue as assistant coach.

Mr. Pritchett will assume general supervision of physical training and education for all students, and will in all probability assist
Coaches Younger and Tilson in the direction of cinder path activities. As chairman of the athletic committee, he will supervise
the making of all athletic schedules, the financial management of all athletic teams, and the subsequent addition of new members
to the coaching staff of the college.

The Woodberry Forest coach will come to Davidson highly recommended. As a student at the University of Tennessee, he was
a four-letter athlete and a star in each of the four major branches of intercollegiate sport. He has directed the
athletic programs of a number of Tennessee, Virginia, and Kentucky prep schools. His success at Woodberry Forest during the past
six years has brought him numerous offers from leading southern colleges and universities, among them the University of Virginia and
the University of North Carolina.

The class of 1873 is planning to have its fifty-fifth reunion at commencement; and word has been received from Rev.
J. N. H. Summerell, D.D., of New Bern, and Rev. E. P. Davis, D.D., of Greenville, S. C., that they
plan to attend. Four of the 1878 men have already signified their intention to attend the fiftieth reunion of their
class.
