CAL - SNAKE

BY JOHN ENGEL

"Tell us, son, how are classes? Do you have a girlfriend? Have you pledged a fraternity?"

"Do you see him? I don't see him. They all look the same."

"Want to hear a joke? The last time I was in Hawaii I saw 10,000 palms. Three were on trees and the rest were on waiters, bellhops, and tourist guides. Ha ha ha ha."

"Son, why don't you put on a shirt with a collar? And did you know your boxer shorts are showing? Might want to hike 'em up."

"Your fraternity doesn't put up nasty posters, do they, Cal?"

"No way! We'll never pick at our kids, and nag them, or tell dumb jokes."

"Snake, do you suppose we'll act that way when we have kids in school?"

"Hey, this isn't funny! Go back to your own comic strip! Leave me alone."

"I haven't had a job since Superman left. I still can't keep the quiet life, so I decided to hide out here... I'm Auntie Matter— but I can give you Auntie M."

"With all that much toot, the..."

"Really, I'm supposed to lose some weight— Hello, boys..."

"Don't shake my hand, we might explode."
