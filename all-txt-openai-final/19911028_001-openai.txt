**Fraternities' Fliers Spark Controversy Among Students**

By Meredith Boone and Leigh McKeever

In response to several controversial party fliers, Rusk House withdrew most of their financial and social support from Sigma Alpha
Epsilon’s Electric Jello party on October 18th, with seven hours advance warning. Rusk did pay for half of the products
that had already been bought before they decided to withdraw.

The fliers and Rusk’s response to them have created controversy among Davidson students. Students have voiced their distaste for Phi
Delta Theta's 1-900-AIR-BAND flyer and one of the acts in the competition. One group of performers wore only red socks
over their genitals while they imitated sexual acts with an inflatable female doll. Some members of the audience likened the
performance to a gang rape and left the party as a result.

Depicted on the SAE flyers were several defaced Nagel reproductions with captions such as “Oral Annie,” “Carrie Collie,” and “Tanya
Tightbody.” In the case of “Oral Annie,” the sketch was of a woman on all fours, provocatively dressed. Other comments
on the Sigma Alpha Epsilon flyers included “She likes to slurp it whole.”

Mary Faith Mount and Mary Bryan, co-chairs of Rusk’s social board, decided to withdraw Rusk's support after being approached by
several women. These women were extremely angry about the implied association between Rusk and the fliers. They also expressed hope
that Rusk would sever its connection with the party. After discussing the matter with both Deans of Students Will Terry
and Leslie Marsicano, Mount and Bryan notified the SAE’s of their decision to withdraw most finances, monitors, bartenders, and all
other support from Friday’s party.

Mount felt that the drastic action was necessary. She said, “Otherwise, passively accepting the fliers would have been condoning them.”
When approached about the subject, Dean Terry said, “I think that the flyers were in poor taste. I think that
the PCC will have to set up standards because we obviously can’t depend on individual discretion alone. I do not
consider such standards to be censorship because they would be coming from the students versus the administration.”

**Gulf War Strategist Discusses Air Campaign**

By Kevin Miller

Major General Buster C. Glosson, director of all United States Air Force tactical planning and maneuvering and the man who
General Norman Schwarzkopf called the “one person most responsible for America’s successful air campaign throughout the Gulf conflict,” spoke Thursday
night in the 900 room on “When Diplomacy Fails.”

Glosson explained that when our nation went to war in January 1991, we did not go to war because of
failure in diplomacy. Instead, he said that the administration exhausted all possible avenues of resolve to find that the use
of military force was the only solution to a situation that was becoming more dangerous by the day.

Glosson said that force should be used as only a last resort, and that it should not be done out
of frustration and anger towards another nation, or because the administration was not creative enough to find an alternative solution.
He did say, however, “if a nation does not use military force at all, it will become an easy victim
to an aggressor.”

Glosson then outlined the four factors that should be met before a nation uses force. He also showed how the
United States and the United Nations used these factors before engaging in war on Iraq. First, he said a nation
should use up all possible political and economic plans of resolution before using force. Although the United Nations’ use of
the sanctions toward Iraq met this condition, Glosson said that Saddam Hussein was supplying his troops, building up his capabilities,
and continuing to trade so well that these sanctions would not resolve the conflict. He also said that if these
sanctions had continued, a move favored by many critics of the Gulf War, the support of all the other nations
and of the American people would have dwindled greatly.

Second, he said a nation...

Annie Adams, President of Rusk and the Patterson Court Council, was out of town during the pull-out decision, she supported
Mount and Bryan’s actions. Adams said, “Mary Faith and Mary definitely made the right decision. It was entirely appropriate. This
isn’t the first time that this type of thing has happened.” As President of the PCC, Adams

Bowdoin Professor Speaks On Nicaraguan Elections, United States Foreign Policy
By Russ Tisinger

Allen Wells, Professor of History at Bowdoin College in Maine, spoke last week in the Morrison Room about his personal
experience of the 1990 democratic elections in Nicaragua and United States foreign policy toward Nicaragua since. Wells attempted to explain
just how former President Daniel Ortega lost the election to now-president Chamarro. According to Wells, symbols played an important role
in the election, much as they did in the 1988 campaign for president of the United States. Wells attended Daniel
Ortega’s final campaign rally before the February election. Ortega appeared at the rally without his usual fatigues, joyful, with his
fists raised high. His campaign song, “The Fighting Cock with Spurs,” a pop ditty with a catchy melody, was blaring
over loudspeakers behind him, describing Ortega as a fierce fighter of Yankee imperialism. Wells described the whole affair as a
“half dance, half political theater.”

Giovanni Addresses Need For Desegregation
By Tom Koonce

In a moving talk last Thursday night, Nikki Giovanni spoke at Davidson. Giovanni is currently a teacher at Virginia Tech.
Giovanni spoke on education and how segregation is a disservice to everyone. She commented on how people cannot be educated
in a vacuum. She said that you need black input because people cannot live together and pretend like they don’t
know each other. Giovanni added that you don’t have to live as a black person to understand black authors, all
you have to do is be able to read. Giovanni said that there needs to be changes in America. “It’s
1991 and it’s time,” said Giovanni. She commented on how white America has the right to name everything. On poetry,
Giovanni said, “If poetry isn’t going to speak to the betterment of mankind, what’s it for?” Giovanni also talked about
how earth is just a ball and everyone in America needs to be taken into space to see that what
we are living on is just a ball. She also said that an old lady needs to be sent into
space. She spoke on how she can’t imagine how people could live with aliens from space because everyone is so
ill-prepared to live with each other on earth.

Alcohol Enforcement Council Reprimands Student, Fraternity For ID Violation
By Ross Sloop

The Alcohol Enforcement Council recently placed a sophomore on ten weeks social probation. This student was placed on probation because
of a blatant alcohol policy violation. This person showed two underage identification cards to the student checking IDs to be
admitted down into the basement of a Patterson Court house. In the commotion at the top of the stairs, the
student was stamped as being of legal drinking age and was let down into the basement. The house, Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, was also put on probation for this violation. As for the student, the probation that he received was the
first such action of individual punishment taken by the AEC. Previously only houses were responsible for violations of the Alcohol
Policy. By taking such unprecedented action, the AEC is trying to send a message to students that individuals as well
as houses will be punished for violations of the Alcohol Policy. The AEC consists of a representative from each Patterson
Court house, two other members of the Patterson Court Council, the PCC President and a secretary member. The President and
Secretary do not have the power to vote.
