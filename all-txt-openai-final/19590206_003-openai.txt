a x FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 1959 —— Davidsonian

The sport scene was bare early this week as Davidson athletes shook out two-week-old exam cramps and prepared for the
home stretch of the winter season. However, the ever affluent coaching staff offered plenty of printable material.

Coach Jim Wathall was relating some of his former high school coaching experiences. "Yes, sir,” he said in his West
Virginia accent, “that Buster Smith was quite a boy. He used to say ‘Give me the ball enough, Coach, and
I'll make the Hall of Flame.’ “We were circling a big lake one day when one of the fellows said,
‘Look at that reservoir!’ “You can’t fool me,’ said Buster. ‘I don’t see no Indians.’ He was always afraid that
the guys would go off and leave him stranded!”

Coach Tucker as usual was loquacious, expounding on the virtues of his swimmers. “If we swim our best times, we'll
win this weekend—,” he vowed. “Hudgins could be undefeated now, but I had him hold off in two 440’s so
he'd be ready for the relay. That’s why he lost the two races he did.”

Bespectacled baseball coach Tom Stevens was lamenting the loss of little Richmond Rucker who was off to spend a semester
in Geneva, Switzerland. “For a little man he surely can throw a long way. I was counting on him to
play center field this year.”

“V.P.I. Invades Wildcat Gymnasium This Evening”

The Wildcat basketball team faces an important conference foe tonight as they play host to V.P.I. The home team is
seeking its second conference win against five defeats. In overall competition, the Wildcats have won six and have lost eleven.

Swimmers Take Trip To Georgia By FRED LANE

The Davidson College swimming team, under the direction of Coach George Tucker, left Wednesday on a tour of Georgia. Thursday
the Cats visited Athens to meet the Georgia Bulldogs, who won last year's contest 56-30; today the tankmen move into
Atlanta hoping for victory. With the exception of captain Bob Wynne, all of the boys are returning next year; and
with a fine freshman team coming up to help next year, Davidson can look forward to some very good swimming
teams in the immediate future.

Throughout the season, V.P.I. has been one of the highest-scoring teams in the nation, once going as high as 104
points (against Washington & Lee). Consequently, a large factor in the determination of tonight's decision will probably be the effectiveness
of the Wildcat’s defensive play. In their first encounter of the season, V.P.I. defeated Davidson 91 to 70, but the
Wildcats should prove harder to handle on the home court.

PFEIFFER GAME

On Wednesday night the Wildcats traveled to Misenheimer to meet Pfeiffer in a return contest. Earlier in the season, Davidson
defeated Pfeiffer and one tonight would give the Wildcats a chance to break even for the season, depending upon the
results of the Indians.

The Wildcat grapplers met Emory University’s wrestlers this afternoon at Charleston, S.C. The 'Cats, fresh from a 16-14 win over
the Citadel before exams, will face Wake Forest at Winston-Salem next Friday. Coach Charlie Parker’s charges salvaged the only Davidson
win in a three-sport encounter with the Citadel two weeks ago. This is the third year in a row that
the ‘Cats matmen have decisioned the Bulldogs by only two points. Dave Irvin, Milton Gee, Harold Westervelt, and Jimmy Allen
posted wins. Pins by Irvin and Westervelt helped to provide the winning margin.

Davidson went into today’s match with a 2-2 record, having lost to A.C.C. foes U.N.C. and N.C. State. Coach Parker
stated that he knew very little about Emory’s team.

Heavy Action Next Week For Riflers

This coming week will be an active one for the Davidson Rifle Team. On Saturday, February 7th, the team travels
to Charleston, South Carolina, for competition. Monday the ’Cats fire against Richmond; Tuesday they fire a match with The Citadel.

Claude Finney and Gordon Nevin were recently named on the All-Southern Conference team. Coach Whittle started track today,” he said
glancing out of the window at a lone runner jogging around the track as the sleet and freezing rain continued.

Coach Tucker considers all of these teams better than IMAC 5 but he thinks his own men capable of bagging
two or possibly three wins. Thus far this season Davidson has a respectable record, winning 3 and losing only to
V.M.I. by a close margin in the last relay, and to a very strong Citadel team.

The Intramural Athletic Council voted on Wednesday to approve next Monday, February 9, as the starting date for the handball
tournament. Six games will be played each day, thereby completing a round of action each day. The handball courts in
the gym will be reserved after four o'clock each afternoon, Monday through Thursday, for inter-fraternity games.

Davidson gives no scholarships to swimmers and the team is small by current standards. The 11 boys making the trip
with the varsity are: George Gabel, Bill Hellier, Tom Hudgins, Gordon LeGrand, Jack Finney, Neville Rose, John Scofield, Jim Nucholls,
John Thurmond, and Jim Alexander.

Continuing in its endeavor to devise a workable rule governing eligibility, the Council is studying possibilities of special regulations for
students out for track, swimming, and wrestling. Up to date, Davidson has recorded victories over Emory & Henry, Catawba, Pfeiffer,
Washington & Lee, South Carolina, and Richmond.but that’s against Furman: and on Wednesday, the intramural meets in these, (Carrousel Tournament.
