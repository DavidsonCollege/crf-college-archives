**Service to whom?**

“The primary purpose of Davidson College is to assist students in developing humane instincts and disciplined and creative minds for lives of leadership and service.”

These words from the College’s Statement of Purpose may seem straightforward enough, but in today’s complex global world, achieving those goals is often far more difficult than they seem.

As The Davidsonian reports this week, Sanctuary, a student group on campus, has started a movement to persuade Davidson organizations to buy their t-shirts from “sweat-free” manufacturers, rather than the local distributor we have long relied upon.

The implications of their project should be given close attention by the entire Davidson community since they so clearly highlight the incredibly complex issue of foreign competition and job outsourcing that has captured the national attention and may well play a deciding role in the upcoming presidential election.

While changing our provider to a “sweat-free” company may seem to have few negative implications, doing so could put the seven employees of our current provider, Davidson Screen Printers, in serious jeopardy of losing their jobs.

In fulfilling Davidson’s mission of developing “lives of leadership and service,” who are we supposed to serve first, our local community or those in the larger world outside of our town, state, and country?

If serving one group necessitates hurting another, with what moral compass do we chart our course?

These are each important questions that get to the heart of our College’s Statement of Purpose, yet in today’s complex world lead to no easy answers.

The very complexity of this problem has caused our editorial staff many headaches in coming up with a firm stance to take on this issue.

While many feel a deep connection and strong loyalty to the members of our local community, we also feel the need to better the lot for those working far away in places and who have so little, who many of us may never see.

Because of how difficult and personal these decisions about how best to fulfill our purpose are, there should be no official policy—whether college-wide, or through a subsidiary administration like Patterson Court Council—on where to buy our shirts. The decision to support local manufacturers or fight global economic injustice must be made individually by each organization on campus, according to the consciences of its members, and not mandated by overarching policy.

Only by examining this dilemma individually can we each hope to discover what “lives of leadership and service” truly mean.

**The Outpost Debate: Round two**

Good ol’ Bobby. Our fearless president shows signs of further loosening his tie by his willingness to discuss Outpost: Round two.

It’s interesting to see who will be fighting for or against the Outpost. Can I see everyone that was in favor of scratching the Outpost from the beginning? Anybody? Oh, that’s right. It was an administration policy that was pushed through despite a vast and unified outcry from the student body.

The Outpost debate pitted the student body against the administration, and round two is unlikely to be any different.

Unless of course RLO Dean Marsicano gets her way and succeeds in pitting students against students.

She has framed the debate into whether or not Kappa Sig should be allowed back on campus by stating there isn’t enough space for both the Outpost and the fraternity; we have to choose.

Does anyone remember the days of yesteryear when both the Outpost and Kappa Sig were on the court? Has anything changed?

The Outpost debate has once again been framed by the powers that be. As the debate continues, let us not forget those of us who have missed out on the Outpost their entire Davidson career.

**Correction**

Last week’s article, “H.S. Juniors flock to campus in biggest Junior Day yet” incorrectly stated the number of students visiting Davidson on Junior Day.

During the first Junior Day in February, 150 students were registered and 400 total people attended - the 400 includes parents, siblings, etc.

During the most recent Junior Day, 201 students were registered and 566 total people attended - again the 566 includes family members.

The numbers stated in the article included all visitors, not just students.
