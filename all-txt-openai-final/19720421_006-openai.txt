These three young men just made the discovery of a lifetime. The oldest is 34.

Remember when a young man could get ahead in business simply by growing old? It was a good system for
those with a little talent and a lot of patience, but today’s technology moves too fast to wait for seniority.

At Kodak, our extensive involvement in basic research has made the need for fresh, young thinking more pressing than ever.
So we hire the best new talent we possibly can. Then we do both of us a favor by turning
them loose on real problems, and giving them the freedom and responsibility they need to solve them.

That's how three Kodak scientists in their early thirties just made a breakthrough in liquid lasers, developing an organic dye
laser with a continuous beam. Their discovery means more than just a new kind of laser. It means a whole
range of new laser applications, in fields from medicine to communications.

It was the kind of discovery most men work a lifetime for. Yet these young men still have most of
their lifetimes ahead of them.

Why do we give young men so much freedom and responsibility? Because it’s good business, and we're in business to
make a profit. But in furthering our own business interests, we also further society’s interests. And that’s good.

After all, our business depends on society. So we care what happens to it.

Kodak. More than a business.
