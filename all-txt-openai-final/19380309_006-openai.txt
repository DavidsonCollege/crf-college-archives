Page Six THE DAVIDSONIAN WEDNESDAY, MARCH 29, 1938

Your Film Report Card
By HENRY B. BAKER

Don't be alarmed; I'm just making a personal rating of this column in an ironical manner. I don't have any
dope on the shows this week, and I have the urge to give something four stars.

Scheduled for Wednesday, March 29 is “LOVE IS ON THE AIR.” I thumbed through all the magazines and found nothing,
but here is the cast which includes Ronald Reagan, June Travis, Eddie Acuff, and Ben Weldon.

The same goes for Thursday and Friday night, but this time there's one for “EVERYBODY'S DOING IT” on Friday. “DR.
RHYTHM” on Thursday is probably the better of the two shows. Bing Crosby is upgraded as a police officer and
is supported by Mary Carlisle, Beatrice Stoll, and Andy Devine.

An unusual thing will happen on Saturday! A good melodrama will be shown which really represents the thinking college. “SALLY,
IRENE, AND MARY” is a high-rating semi-musical with a swell cast. The four outstanding names are Alice Faye, Tony Martin,
Jimmy Durante, and Fred Allen.

“WOODEN WEDDING” is scheduled for a two-day run on Monday and Tuesday. All I know at the present time is
the name of the attraction.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

State Health Board Answers W.T.R....

Dear W.T.R.,

Several organizations of students who have met and discussed the problem have gone on record as favoring the control program
as outlined by the Union Public Health Service. This for the control of venereal diseases is a matter of great
importance. The incidence of syphilis, for example, occurs most frequently in young adults, with half of all reported cases between
the ages of 20 and 30. This is important information for all young people of our state, for it shows
that they should be and must become concerned with stamping out this disease if we are to hope for success
in our fight. The attitude of the public generally is undoubtedly changing and we feel that this will be of
immeasurable help in educating the people so that every individual will feel a definite responsibility in this vital fight for
the eventual eradication of venereal diseases.

Very sincerely yours,
DR. P. H. GWYNN

Society of Fellows annually admits new fellows. This year the fellowship committee chose about ten persons from over the United
States and other foreign countries. Fred W. Smith, 65, retired naval reserve officer, is the director at Washington U.

Charlie McCarthy, the 2x4 “great lover” is a favorite of Hunter College seniors, who prefer tall, dark, and handsome men.

In a poll of students at Hunter College, President Roosevelt was voted the greatest living man.

been chosen as the “Dream Girl of 1938” for the Pi Kappa Alpha social fraternity. The selection was announced by
D. R. Oertel, secretary of the 1938 Convention Committee. She is of the Alpha Delta Pi sorority of Wittenburg College
and will serve as hostess to the convention to be held during August in Los Angeles. Miss Florence George, who
sings in the Chicago Civic Opera, has made her film debut in Paramount's “College Swing.”

Defective rifles are to be replaced by new ones which will be sent in the near future. A machine gun
was among the condemned equipment. The inspectors are experts who have had training at regular ordnance training camps. It is
part of their line of work and study to make this type of trip.

The practice of medicine, he said, is just a continuation of this, and one has to find out the facts

Since that time the fraternity has grown to a national organization of 78 chapters, with a total membership of over
20,000. The second chapter was established at Davidson, exactly a year after Alpha. This group at present ranks as one
of the outstanding Greek-letter societies on the Davidson campus, and was recently chosen second in efficiency among all chapters over
the nation.
