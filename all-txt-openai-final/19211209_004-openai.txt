DO YOUR CHRISTMAS SHOPPING EARLY

Only ten more days and the grand day will be upon us. How about that suit, that overcoat, that hat,
those shoes, shirts, collars, ties, traveling bags, and gloves? It makes you dizzy to think of the many things you
need for Christmas, doesn’t it? I visited Carolina's leading men’s clothier a few days ago just to see what the
latest in togs was. I don’t think I have ever seen styles that appealed to me more than these of
the present day. They are nifty, and yet are sensible. I believe you will say the same thing after you
have seen them. The same note of saneness runs through everything. Overcoats, shoes, and suits alike are built for appearance,
comfort, and durability. Ed Mellon’s caters to the men of Davidson. He keeps us in mind when making his purchases.
He studies our needs and is always prepared to meet them. All of us wish to make a good appearance
before the folks back home during the holidays. Clothes make a difference, if you don't believe it, try going down
the main street of your hometown without any. Think of the ties and gloves we are going to need for
ourselves and for Christmas presents for our friends. Mellon’s are better prepared to meet these needs than any other clothier
in the Carolinas. Get a Davidson Hat for Christmas. (Adv.)

TURKEYS!

Here's why CAMELS are the quality cigarette
R. J. REYNOLDS TOBACCO COMPANY, Winston-Salem, N. C.

BECAUSE we put the utmost quality into this one brand. Camels are as good as it’s possible for skill, money,
and lifelong knowledge of fine tobaccos to make a cigarette. Nothing is too good for Camels. And bear this in
mind! Everything is done to make Camels the best cigarette it’s possible to buy. Nothing is done simply for show.
Take the Camel package for instance. It’s the most perfect packing science can devise to protect cigarettes and keep them
fresh. Heavy paper — secure foil wrapping — revenue stamp to seal the fold and make the package air-tight. But
there’s nothing flashy about it. You’ll find no extra wrappers. No frills or furbelows. Such things do not improve the
smoke any more than premiums or coupons. And remember — you must pay their extra cost or get lowered quality.
If you want the smoothest, mellowest, mildest cigarette you can imagine — and one entirely free from cigaretty aftertaste, It’s
Camels for you.
