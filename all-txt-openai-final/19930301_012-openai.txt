Music Review... "Everything" You Always Wanted from a Great Band

By Rachel Newcomb

If you were lucky enough to catch Everything’s incredible live show at PIKA last month, you were probably impressed with
their boundless energy and feverish vitality. In my opinion, they are one of the most talented bands I’ve heard at
Davidson in a long time. Their new release, Play, which was available for sale at their performance, proves that Everything
is definitely a band to watch.

It is difficult to label Everything’s musical style. At times, their spirited enthusiasm is reminiscent of the Spin Doctors, only
without the commercialism. Their driving bass grooves could be compared to the hedonistic funk of the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
But for the most part, they overstep comparison for a unique style all their own.

Play begins with a harmonious anthem to the Earth, “Peace Dance.” The forceful percussion groundwork is topped with horn-flecked melodies
and a bit of synthesizer for a futuristic sound. This is one of my favorite tracks. It avoids being sappy
and comes across as a positive statement for appreciating and respecting the world’s gifts.

The next cut on the album is the festive but cheesy “South of the Border.” This song is heavy on
the horns and utilizes every clichéd Mexican sound possible. Words like “calypso” and “pina colada” pop out at you on
first listen. However, a closer look at the lyrics reveals that Everything is trying to say that behind Mexico’s rampant
tourism lies an extremely poor and impoverished nation.

Not all of Play is a political statement, however. “S.L.W.B.” (which stands for “skinny little white butt”) is another hilarious
cut that attempts to make no heavy-handed statements whatsoever. The funky James Brown guitar sound is perfectly complemented by just
the right amount of horns. “Who Do You Love” is a pretty good track that reminds me of Blues Traveler’s
“Down in the Groove.”

Some of the songs I don’t like at all. “Grind,” which begins with what sounds like chanting monks, is a
song which never seems to get off the ground. “I’m Alive” is another fairly unoriginal track. Sometimes Everything seems to
go overboard on their usage of horns. Using samples from “Pink Panther” and the “James Bond Theme,” “Spies” doesn’t seem
to have much of their characteristic energy, but is not a bad tune.

But by far, the cut that has spent the most time on my turntable is the amazing “Soul Fish.” This
song best captures Everything’s distinct, playful live sound. Describing a stylish, swinging fish with “a leisure suit, some gold medallions,
you ain’t gonna stop this fishy stallion.” “Soul Fish” is filled with pounding bass and aquatic noises. The lyrics are
clever and simple, and the many different drums make this an extremely danceable song. The end is punctuated with a
rousing howl of “Soooouul” sung in the style of the television show Soul Train.

Everything is a fairly new band and the Play CD has a lot of rough edges. However, it shows that
the group has a great deal of raw talent and some of the songs are very good. When they played
at PiKA I was astounded with the incredible amount of energy they have. They seemed like a band that had
its act together and looked like they have a great time singing and jumping around. Although the lead singer did
offhandedly tell the Davidson audience, “I see a lot of J.Crew out there,” they had a good rapport with the
crowd. Unfortunately, one of their best songs, “Junkyard Jam” isn't on Play, but the album is definitely worth getting ahold
of. Write Everything, Box 5609, JMU, Harrisonburg, Va. 22807. Don't miss the next Davidson show on March 5, which will
be sponsored by Connor, KA, PIKA, Rusk and SAE.
