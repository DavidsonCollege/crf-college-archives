Somebody ain't livin’ right! That's all there is to it. For four consecutive Saturdays the ‘Cats have come out on the short end of the score, and each time the other team has been “right.” As Coach Spearman says, “We're hitting ‘em on the wrong days.”

That powerful Duke offense functioned almost perfectly here on Richardson Field. The V. M. I. Cadets, keyed to a high pitch, took advantage of the absence of five Wildcat regulars and threw up a stalwart defense to hold the Felines scoreless. South Carolina, although without the services of their ace ball carrier, Dick Little, also played a great defensive game against the Lafferty-less Cats. Then the Praying Colonels of Centre played what was probably their best game this season last week and kept Lafferty in check, a feat which even the Dukes were unable to accomplish.

All Wildcat eyes and hearts are turning to the Furman embroglio, a home game in nearly a month. It looks like one of those nerve-wrackers. The Purple Hurricane has a good ball club this year, but Wildcats will be out to avenge that point upset of last season and, barring accidents, should be in top shape. But as Felix, that omniscient member of the feline family, takes a gander at the situation, he can see nothing but victory for his boys. A nice, juicy win over Furman would give the doughty ‘Cat something to chew on that would take the bitter taste of those last four setbacks out of his mouth and put him in the right frame of mind to take some good, healthy bites out of the Tar Heels on Homecoming Day. Due mainly to injuries, the Davidson offense has failed to click since the Duke game, but if Teeny’s ankle and shoulder respond to treatment as expected, he ought to go to town against the Hurricane.

Here's a surprise for you: Red Miller, reserve tackle, has been running in the backfield in practice and has done remarkably well both as a blocker and ball carrier. He may see action back there Saturday. Don’t forget that Harvard game that comes up the week after next. It would be a huge feather in Felix’s cap if the ‘Cats pulled an upset on the Crimson. The Athletic Association is doing a great deal toward putting Davidson on the map by scheduling an inter-sectional game with a big team.

From the tone of a letter recently received from Carl Carlson, who was a campus leader and ODK man here last year and is now attending Harvard Business School, they seem to think that Davidson puts out nothing better than a high school team. Carl says: “I have bets on Davidson with 30 point odds. They all think I’m crazy up here. The only real offense Harvard has, though, is a passing attack, and, believe me, they have one of the best passers in the game. If Davidson can watch the passes, they'll have a swell chance, I believe. Luck to you.”

Like to land a few bets myself with Davidson and 30 points. With the shekels he ought to clean up, Carl ought to be able to quit school and retire right after the game. The ‘Cats could give the northern boys the surprise of their lives.

The handwriting on the wall seems to indicate that in a few more years Duke will have broken off football relations with Davidson. Wake Forest has already been dropped from the Blue Devil schedule, breaking up the Big Five. The Dukes are after bigger game and it would not be surprising if they withdrew from the Southern Conference. Contrary to a popular notion, however, the breaking of Davidson-Duke relations is not a new idea by any means. Three years ago the Sports Editor of the Duke Chronicle wrote the following article: “Everyone from dean to student agrees with us that Duke has little to gain and everything to lose when our elevens play Davidson or Wake Forest. It is true that those schools would rather defeat Duke than win every other game on their schedule. Davidson was soundly beaten by Army, 41-0, and returned to Carolina to prime for us by holding open the Saturday we played Tech, resting and devising ways to upset us. Yet when we defeated them 20-0 we got no more than a bad injury to our two outstanding linemen and a hard game with no recognition.”

He went on to say that it was only fair to the members of the Duke team for the athletic directors and Coach Wade to drop these two Big Five teams from the schedule and arrange games with more formidable opponents which would give the Blue Devils something worth working for.

We at Davidson must, perforce, admit that we very seldom turn out teams of the caliber of the Wademen, but there are several games on our schedule every year that we are just as anxious to win as the one with Duke, contrary to the rather rash statement of our colleague. If Davidson does discontinue her annual affair with Duke, we don’t believe there will be any tears shed in these parts. Since Davidson does not subsidize athletics, it is impossible for us to make a very good showing against large schools who follow this practice, and it is unjust to the members of the team to expect them to go out every week against bigger and more experienced men when there is such a scarcity of competent substitutes to take their places when they are tired and injured.

It is quite conceivable that the 'Cats might have won their last three games had it not been for that unfortunate contest with Duke in which so many men were injured. With Lafferty and the other injured regulars in those games, it probably would have been a much different story and a season which at best can now be but a very mediocre one and at worst may be a total flop might have ended with the ‘Cats in the upper echelon.

#### Golf Tournament Divided Into Three Flights

The annual fall golf tournament has got under way with approximately twenty-eight entries. These were divided into flights according to scores made in a qualifying round which all played in order to enter.

At the time of the writing of this article, there have been nine matches reported as played in the first flight. In the second flight, there has been only one played. Ed Peas defeated Bill Crooks in this match. Tom Daniel beat D. A. McClean, Neal Scott defaulted to Don Cleveland, Karl Hudson defeated Herbert Coddington, and Andy Dale defeated Jerry Harris. Don't forget that Harvard game that comes up the week after next. It would be a huge feather in Felix’s cap if the ‘Cats pulled an upset on the Crimson. The Athletic Association is doing a great deal toward putting Davidson on the map by scheduling an inter-sectional game with a big team.

The entries and flights are as follows:

**First Flight:**
- Tom Daniel
- D. A. McClean
- Neal Scott
- Don Cleveland
- Karl Hudson
- Herbert Coddington
- Andy Dale
- Jerry Harris

**Second Flight:**
- Ed Peas
- Bill Crooks

**Third Flight:**
- Don Cleveland
- Neal Scott
- Jack Abels
- Karl Hudson
- Herbert Coddington
- Andy Dale
- Bob Wyatt
- Jerry Harris
- Mark Lillard

#### Soccer Team Takes on Tough Schedule

The Davidson soccer team looks good this season and has hopes for a good year. During the practices, Tommy Harnsberger, Oscar Armstrong, Lee Ogburn, and Joe Kellam are outstanding. Charlie Bixler, who is now out because of a broken leg, is expected to be back in the lineup in the next ten days or two weeks. All of the boys are rapidly getting into shape for their first game with High Point on November 3rd.

The Athletic Association has bought new uniforms for the team and they hope to show their appreciation for them with a victory over the High Point team.

The soccer team has a most strenuous and extensive schedule this year. It is as follows:
- High Point at Davidson, Nov. 3
- Duke at Memorial Stadium, Nov. 11
- Clemson at Duke, Nov. 20
- Clemson at Winthrop Bowl, Nov. 27 (exhibition)
- Clemson at Clemson, Dec. 3

There are other tentative dates that cannot be published this early. Davidson hopes to play a nine-game schedule.This year, half of the won and lost column.

Leads Wildcats
Wildcats Downed By Captain Bailey

Williams continued his consistent good play in the Centre game on last Saturday. His brilliant kicking has constantly been keeping the Wildcats out of holes and his great pass-snagging has netted the team many long gains. He has ably upheld his All-State honors of last year.

Wildcats Battle Strong Colonels For Fourth Consecutive Setback
German Leads Centre’s Powerful Attack to Down ’Cats. Dennis and Williams Play Seema Game in Snowstorm

An inspired band of Praying Colonels from old Centre College handed Davidson her fourth consecutive licking Saturday, winning 8-0 in a homecoming game played before 2,000 shivering fans made cozy by continuous rain and snow.

Displaying a rugged, well-balanced defense and a speedy, powerful attack, the Kentuckians outclassed the Wildcats in every department of play except punting, putting together a second period safety and a touchdown in the third quarter to gain a well-earned victory. The soggy field and impregnable Centre line proved too much for the Wildcat attack and it simply didn’t get started.

Centre's safety came in the second quarter after the ’Cats had taken the ball on their own six-inch line. On the next play Lafferty attempted a wide end run but was tackled back of his goal by Dick Martin.

The Praying Colonels rang the bell again in the third period with the only touchdown of the day, the result of a perfectly executed pass from German to Glenn Davis. German set the stage for the pass by intercepting Hand’s pass and bringing it down to the Wildcat 29. Lafferty, hampered by his shoulder injury, failed to receive the adequate blocking throughout the first two quarters and never had a chance to flash his usual form, finally having to leave the fray with an injured ankle.

A blinding snowstorm held the Furman team in check after their star quarterback and back, Lafferty, finally got into the game and turned in a sparkling performance, getting some long punt returns and off-tackle slashes. However, the ’Cats came through the Centre game without any serious injuries and should be in the best condition that they have been in since the Duke game. “Twinkle-toes” Lafferty, who failed to get started against Centre, is expected to be in good shape again and it is hoped that his presence will furnish the spark that the ’Cats have lacked during the last three games. Coach Gene McEver is working his charges unusually hard this week, and especially is he drilling them on offensive plays, though he refuses to comment on the possible outcome. Captain Bailey Williams has been kicking well all week and his kicking has been an invaluable find for the Dazzlers.

Although every factor seems to favor the powerful invaders, there is a feeling around the campus that the ’Cats will again hit their stride this week.

Duke, Carolina Blaze Onward.
Duke University and the University of North Carolina continued their march toward their meeting to determine the Southern Conference championship by smashing out 13-0 victories over Colgate and Tulane respectively. Duke's hard-charging line had no mercy on the Colgate backs, and broke through to block two punts which led to touchdowns. Carolina, playing before a Homecoming crowd, played the favored Green Wave off their feet in the first half and then held to the 13-0 lead through the second.

V. M. I., with a perfect record in conference play, took on the ex-member Virginia, and impressively polished off the Cavaliers, 26-7. In another inter-Virginia game, Virginia Poly smashed Washington & Lee, 19-7.

Maryland provided a big upset when the Old Liners thrashed Syracuse, last week’s conqueror of Cornell.

North Carolina State added another victory to their list when the Wolfpack tumbled the luckless Demon Deacons from Wake Forest, 20-0. Berlinski and Rooney were, as usual, the big guns in the State attack.

Burns and Tears Rewoven
INDEPENDENCE BLDG.
CHARLOTTE, N. C.

While the Wildcats were being snowed under at Centre last week, the Purple Hurricane hit its stride for the first time this season to rout completely little Presbyterian, 52-0. Coach Dizzy McLeod has developed a powerful team from a large squad, and in June Scott he has one of the most dangerous backs in the conference. Scott was injured slightly in the Citadel game but will be in the pink of condition Saturday. Patrick is also a brilliant back and ran wild against the Blue Stockings last week. The Purple Hurricane also boasts two outstanding linesmen in Smoak and Maddox, who are perhaps the stars of a heavy and aggressive forward wall.
