MRS. POWELL DIES IN CHARLOTTE.
Ben Powell was called home suddenly last Friday to Charlotte on account of the sudden death of his mother after
a brief illness. Mrs. Powell leaves only her husband and son. The sympathy of the entire student body is extended
to them in their loss.

REV. D. H. ROLSTON THURSDAY NIGHT.
Rev. D. H. Rolston, pastor of the First Presbyterian church of Charlotte, N.C., will conduct the Y. M. C. A.
service Thursday night. Mr. Rolston is an enthusiastic minister and will come with a special message to young men.

Last Thursday night Professor Mayhew conducted the Y. M. C. A. meeting. He chose for his subject, “The Mutability of
Man and the Immutability of God,” and presented the subject in such a strikingly original way that every one of
his hearers was deeply impressed.

POWHATAN PRESENTED BY KING'S DAUGHTERS.
The Indian pageant, Powhatan, presented last Tuesday evening, April 28, by the King’s Daughters of Concord, N. C., under the
direction of Mr. Albert Baker of Chicago, was a harmonious combination of characteristic costumes, talented voices, and beautiful girls. With
a succession of choruses and solos, broken here and there by dialogue and local hits, it told the main points
of the story of Captain John Smith and Pocahontas. Among the most pleasing features of the evening were the solos
by Pocahontas and Laughing Water, respectively. Mr. Baker himself played the part of Captain John Smith, the roles of General
Rolfe and Powhatan being taken by Messrs. Norman and Kellenburger, the latter being from Greensboro. Miss Atkins was the pianist.
Of the musical numbers, “It Points The Way,” by Mr. Baker and chorus, made the hit of the evening. After
the play, a general reception was tendered the players and visitors by the fraternities of the college.
