Davidson Music Professor Shares in Victory, Farrell Sick With Envy: Someone besides the soccer team, the field hockey team, and
Frank Ivey was standing in the victory circle last week, and it wasn’t Mr. Ed. James Swisher accompanied an international
singing champion in Munich, leaving Farrell the only person on campus without a win. Big Ed, understandably, was furious. “Here’s
some guy, probably never touched a weight in his life, listens to WDAV, and he’s a world champion. My guys
probably couldn't beat North Meck!” he stormed. “I’m gonna have a talk with the Athletic Director about this!” Strangely, the
A.D. refused to fire Mr. Ed, despite the fact that the ’Cats opponents have been outscoring them at the rate
of 5 to 1.

Deal of the Week: Look, how about signing the Grateful Dead or the Clash? Bet you'd sell more tickets.

Other things Davidson Students Don’t Care About, but which get the Trustees to Read The Davidsonian: Humanities Program, New Faculty
Members, The Phi Society, Career Symposiums [sic]. Othello Fails to Entertain Local Audience: Kinda rose to the occasion, didn’t they?
This isn’t exactly Broadway, you know. Quick Quiz — how many of you were gullible enough to pay exorbitant prices
for those Artist Series tickets? Come on now, get those hands up. We know who you are. P.T. Barnum would
have loved you guys.

Sports: Jeff Mann’s pundits have been vociferously arguing all week over whether or not Steve Soud has the capability of
writing about anything but the Orioles, UNC (and its fans), and poor officiating. Look, I'll agree that Southern Conference officials
bite the royal salami, that the Heels are overrated, and that their fans are loud-mouthed, ignorant boors; however, four years
of reading about this has given me an ulcer. Just to be nice, I’ll get you started with some new
topics: 1) Charlie Slagle’s waistline: Jane Fonda’s Biggest Defeat. 2) “We'll Get ’em Next Time”: Ed Farrell’s Life Story. 3)
Namath and Martin: Are they twins? Let me know what you think, Steve.

Athlete of the Week: The Vegetables, of course. Need I say more?
