An Illusion

In the strawberry field
wild flowers grew here and there
the bees were busily doing their work
carrying their burden
from one flower to another

The silence was not broken by children playing
or cars honking
or anything unhuman
except one sound -
the sound of a body in the last stages of its death throes

Walking Hand in Hand

Walking with my brother, stones
pressed into the tender flesh
of our feet; we walked
on the soft side of
the road. His sword fell
on my brother’s throat, he
did not cry. Dusk cloaked
me in the mourning arms of night
as I knelt over my
brother’s carcass. I finished my mother’s errand.
I always walk on the
other side of the road.

America

They use roman candles for her birthday cake

JULY 4TH

Dancing fire darts between stars, drawing
awe from all eyes, then, splitting the
expectant silence, bespeaks ears with alto and
tenor thunder. White, red, blue blooms —
burst in the black, shedding petals like
flaming tears from weeping suns.
Children “Oooh” from gaping mouths, their
little hearts thump double-time and silver
light sparks in their eyes, echoing each
magic hue. Men and women stand, shout,
straight, goose bumps flooding every inch
of skin while firework lightning flashes
in their souls, brimming breasts with
patriotic pride. Skyward surging, multicolored
fervor in the grand finale suicide near
stars, with a crashing crescendo
imitating war, raining liquid light drops like
arc welders. And through every sinew, every soul,
every heart of Americana watching, whirl grandiose
feelings of God-given glory.

Band Party: 3 a.m.

Steeped in sweat
and smoky swirls
of alcoholic exhales
our eyes catch —
but, hell you’re
too drunk to know.

Colleen Bairas '88

Transcendental Ennui

Trains slipping out of station
out of town passing outward,
bound for skyscrapers and fields
sitting in this car whose lifespan
I neither care nor wonder with tea in my hand.
Trains rolling over iron tracks
that glitter with black soot
and wooden planks that burn
when cigarettes are left behind
but I have carried a pail of water with me.
City just ahead
the fields do not take long to leave
though they were green and gold
and the wind loved them
I am happy to be home.

Pauline Rhodes

Who Will Wake The Dead

The night is here again.
Was it ever gone?
Alone I sit; the world is dead,
and I, I cannot sleep
for if I do, who will wake the dead?
Who will make the world real again?
Oh God! The night is here again.
The endless task stretches out before me;
fear paralyzes me, and my stomach sickens.
Does everyone really sleep?
If only they would waken!
But alas someday they won't.
