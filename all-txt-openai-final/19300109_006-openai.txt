1930 Wildcat Football Schedule Is Completed
Sites for Carolina and Wake Forest Contests Yet Undecided

With the signing of a contract with Erskine College to be played at Davidson on October 4, the 1930 football
schedule of the Davidson College Wildcats has been completed, and the places of all contests have been definitely arranged with
the exception of the Carolina and Wake Forest frays, according to Capt. Norton G. Pritchett, director of athletics here.

The completed Davidson card gives the Wildcats ten engagements, five of which are with Southern Conference foes—the same number encountered
last fall. Four of the mixups will be played on Richardson Field at Davidson, one is definitely scheduled for Charlotte
and another is likely for that city, one in Greensboro, and the others on the home fields. The Carolina game
will go either to Chapel Hill or Davidson, this to be decided by the officials at the University of North
Carolina.

Captain Pritchett stated that the Citadel authorities had decided to play the Citadel-Davidson game in Charlotte, instead of Charleston, S.
C. It is a home game for the Bulldogs, but they wanted to return to this section for the battle.
The Wake Forest game will either be in Charlotte or will be played in Davidson.

The 1930 card follows:
September 20—Elon at Davidson.
September 27—N. C. State at Greensboro.
October 4—Erskine at Davidson.
October 11—Dukeat Durham. October 18—Citadel at Charlotte. October 25—V. P. I. at Davidson. November 1—V. M. I. at Lexington, Va.
November 8—Wofford at Davidson. November 15—Carolina at Chapel Hill or Davidson. November 27—Wake Forest at Charlotte or Davidson.

Students taking advanced French and membership is based on scholarship. The club aims to incite the more extensive study of
French among the members and to promote the general interest of French on the campus. Each year the club is
responsible for bringing several prominent speakers to Davidson. These occasions are always looked forward to with much interest by the
student body and are very well attended. These speeches are made entirely in French by well-known Frenchmen. Arrangements are being
made for several very interesting programs to be held sometime in the next few months. Members of the club are:
F. R. Brown, W. C. Ragin, E. E. Marsh, D. K. Miller, A. N. Halverstadt, D. Rusk.

All-America Picked By Literary Digest
A composite 1929 All-America Football Team has just been compiled by The Literary Digest from eleven major All-America selections and
the opinions of more than five hundred sports writers and critics of all sections of the country. This mythical “team
of teams” includes:
Ends: Donchess, Pittsburgh; Fesler, Ohio State.
Tackles: Nagurski, Minnesota; Sleight, Purdue.
Guards: Cannon, Notre Dame; Montgomery, Pittsburgh.
Center: Ticknor, Harvard.
Quarter-back: Carideo, Notre Dame.
Halfbacks: Cagle, Army; Banker, Tulane.
Fullback: Parkinson, Pittsburgh.

Chapel Speaker: I made myself a success. I started life as a barefoot boy.
Voice from the Rear: I wasn’t born with shoes on myself.

LINGLE RECOVERS POCKETBOOK
(Continued from page 1)
found that Doctor Lingle had resided in Richmond, Virginia, and forwarded it to officials at that post office. They, in
turn, sent it on to the Davidson postmaster, who handed the pocketbook to Doctor Lingle. The most careful search failed
to reveal the greenbacks, although everything else was in the pocketbook.
