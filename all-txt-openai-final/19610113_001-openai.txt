**DUGGAN PROFILES DEAN BAILEY’S DAD (See Page Two)**

**VOL. XLIX DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N.C. FRIDAY, JANUARY 13, 1961 NUMBER FOURTEEN**

Dean John C. Bailey “resigned” at a faculty meeting last Tuesday. Davidson College will have a new dean of students by September. Bailey explained, “I wouldn’t say that I resigned. I really don’t have an acting position to resign from.” He explained that he had accepted the position in 1957 as a temporary job. The “resignation” in the faculty meeting was actually to inform the newer members of the faculty that Bailey's position was not permanent. In addition, President D. Grier Martin announced that Dean Bailey had asked him to secure a permanent dean by the beginning of the first semester next fall. President Martin is away from the college and was not available for comment. As far as it can be determined, he has not yet filled the job. Dean Bailey declined to comment as to whether or not the new dean would be from the present faculty. He said that in the first place he did not know, and in the second place, he would rather such information be obtained from the president. Dean Bailey will resume a limited teaching load in September, while aiding the new dean in getting acquainted with the job. He will later assume a full teaching schedule and also plans to do some counseling on a voluntary basis. “I’ll be 60 in the fall,” he said, “and I think that I’ve held an administrative post as long as one man should. I would like to get back to teaching.” Bailey is a professor of Bible and Greek. When he became acting dean in 1957 he was no stranger to the job, having served as regular dean of students from 1941 to 1954, when he resigned to resume teaching. When President John R. Cunningham and Samuel R. Spencer, dean of students, both resigned three years later, Bailey was asked to take the job again until the new president could appoint a permanent dean. However, when D. Grier Martin became president two years ago, he was not ready to appoint a permanent dean, so Bailey has continued in his acting capacity.

**Uris, Outstanding Panelists To Debate ‘Exodus’ Issues**

By ZACH SMITH
Davidsonian Staff Writer

An outstanding panel representing both sides of the controversial Arab-Israeli question will join author Leon Uris on the YMCA’s Book of the Year program Feb. 22-23. The program features Uris’ best-selling novel Exodus, which concerns the Jewish resettlement of Palestine and the creation of the state of Israel. “The nature of the issues involved and the quality of the men we have been able to secure promise a very interesting and possibly quite heated two days,” stated Joe Robinson, chairman of this year’s program. “Final plans are now being completed and we expect active preparation for the program to get underway next week.” Copies of Exodus in the paperback edition will arrive next week and will be on sale in the union by the first of February.

**Magazine Promises To Revive Humor**

The winter issue of Scripts ‘n Pranks will contain more humor than any other issue of the past two years, Charles Cornwell, editor of the publication, stated this week. The issue should be distributed by the first week in the second semester. Cornwell attributes R. D. Jackson with providing a new slant of humor. This slant has an approach much like that of the catalog parody in last year's fall issue. Jackson has been made an associate editor. Included in the issue will be the two winners of the freshman short story contest. Cornwell stated that he was disappointed both with the response to the contest and with the quality of the stories entered. The staff plans to conduct a “scientific experiment” this spring to “ascertain what kind of magazine the student body wants.” Cornwell would not elaborate.

**New Dorm To Be Richardson Hall**

By DON SAUNDERS
Davidsonian Managing Editor

Davidson’s newest dormitory will be named Richardson Hall in recognition of the Richardson family’s contributions to Davidson, President D. Grier Martin announced this week. A $425,000 “challenge grant” to Davidson’s ten-year plan was made last week by the Richardson Foundation. Other contributions to Davidson from members of the Richardson family have included the Preyer Infirmary, major grants in 1929 toward the construction of Chambers Building, and a memorial scholarship fund which has been provided by the family of the late Lunsford Richardson, Jr.

**SCHOLARSHIPS**

The athletic field and stadium were given as a memorial to Lunsford Richardson, Sr. The Richardson Foundation has also created the Richardson Foreign Student Scholarship Program, which this year is supporting 16 students from other countries at Davidson. The foundation's latest gift is $425,000, provided Davidson raises $1,375,000 from other sources by Dec. 21, 1964, to provide a total fund of $1.8 million for six endowed professorships.

**BUILD FACULTY**

The grant will launch the second phase of Davidson's ten-year improvement program. According to the aims of the present ten-year plan as stated in 1957, “the largest allocations in our ten-year plan must be in the area of large-scale endowment for the purpose of building and holding a distinguished faculty of able, dedicated Christian scholars.” President D. Grier Martin, in reporting the Richardson grant, stated that “since 1957, $4,481,610 has been raised in plant and endowment funds toward Davidson's long-range $11.5 million goal, and this splendid Richardson challenge grant launches an effort which should carry the college well beyond the halfway point by December, 1964.”

**VICKS HEAD**

The Richardson family has long been associated with Davidson. Lunsford Richardson, Sr. graduated from Davidson in 1875. Lunsford Richardson began to manufacture the “Croup & Pneumonia Cure” which soon became famous as Vicks VapoRub. Richardson's company has expanded into a world-wide empire in remedies, chemicals, and allied products. Richardson's two sons, H. Smith and the late Lunsford, Jr., attended Davidson in the classes of '06 and ‘14. They both served terms as president of the Vick Chemical Co. H. Smith is now president of the Richardson Foundation. He served as vice-president of Davidson's Board of Trustees from 1933 to 1943, and was president of the alumni association from 1929 to 1932. He was awarded an honorary doctor of laws degree from Davidson in 1959.

**ESTABLISHED IN ‘35**

The Richardson Foundation was established in 1935. It now dispenses about half a million dollars annually to many causes. The foundation has financed a study of North Carolina’s court system and a study of public school curriculum. A project in “political internship” last summer was designed to acquaint U.S. Army reserve officers with expert, up-to-date information on the nature of the Communist threat. The Richardson Foundation hired a scholar in the field to conduct the program. President Martin has called Richardson's grant and its ensuing fund drive “a crucial step in our planned and systematic program to make Davidson the best possible church-related liberal arts college for 1000 men.”

**Dave Brubeck Quartet Signs IFC Concert Program**

By RUSS SHOWALTER
Davidsonian Managing Editor

The Dave Brubeck Quartet will make an appearance on the Davidson campus. The concert will be part of the Davidson Festival, and the Monterey Jazz Festival.

**OPENING OF BELK**

In 1953 The Dave Brubeck Quartet...won the Down Beat critic’s poll as well as winning the readers’ polls of Down Beat and Metronome magazines. For the past two years, they have been selected by the readers of Playboy Magazine as the best jazz combo in the nation.

BRUBECK OCTET
Dave Brubeck, leader of the group, broke into jazz years ago with his Dave Brubeck Octet while Dave was still a student of Darius Milhaud at the Mills Graduate School. The Octet attracted many serious musicians by its experiments in the use of counterpoint, fugue, polyrhythms, and poetry in jazz. Many of these experimental ideas were carried over into The Trio, Brubeck’s first recorded group. When Paul Desmond, who had been one of the original members of The Octet, joined forces with Dave in 1951, the Dave Brubeck Quartet was launched.

EUROPE TOUR
In addition to their many college tours, the Brubeck Quartet made a four-month goodwill tour through most of Europe and the Middle East in 1958. The appearance of the Dave Brubeck Quartet at Davidson will complete the series of three concerts presented by the IFC. The Four Freshmen performed here on Nov. 19 and The Weavers made a Davidson appearance on Dec. 9.

The Interfraternity Council announced today that The Dave Brubeck Quartet will be at Davidson Saturday, March 25, for the last of the IFC 1960-61 Concert Series. The concert will begin at 7:30 p.m. and will last for approximately two hours. The Quartet, a contemporary jazz group, has played at hundreds of colleges and universities throughout the United States. This marks their second appearance at Davidson. The Quartet presently has more than a dozen long-playing record albums to its credit (Columbia label). The group has performed on such television shows as the Ed Sullivan Show, Monitor, Omnibus, and the Steve Allen Show. They have also made appearances at Carnegie Hall, the New York Jazz Festival, and the Newport Jazz Festival.

The Brubeck four, composed of Paul Desmond (alto saxophone), Joe Morello (drums), Eugene Wright (bass), and Dave Brubeck (piano), has, since its 1951 beginning, emerged as one of the most popular jazz groups in America today.

Greek Week Activities
The IFC announced rules for fraternity activities last week. Dr. Labban Returns Dr. George Labban, associate professor of Greek, will resume his teaching duties next semester after taking a sabbatical leave of one semester tenure. During the fall semester, Labban has been editing language tapes for elementary Greek. He stated that he hopes to experiment with the use of tapes in the study of Greek and plans to write a textbook to go along with these tapes. In addition to his work in Greek tapes, Labban has also been collating a Latin manuscript in the general field of the “Alexander Romances.” Prior to his sabbatical leave, Labban traveled through the Mediterranean region in Europe and the Middle East. His particular field of interest was the Syro-Phoenician merchants, a subject which he plans to study much more extensively in future years.

Dr. Robert L. McLeod, Jr., executive secretary of Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity, will speak at the Greek Week banquet for the pledge classes, Interfraternity Council representatives, and fraternity presidents on Monday, Jan. 30. The banquet will initiate Greek Week Activities which will extend through the first week of the second semester. The most constructive pledge class program is the primary consideration for the award. The IFC has recommended to pledge classes 12 projects which include yard work and house cleaning for retired professors, a paper drive for Barium Springs, and collecting old clothes for the Salvation Army.

IMPROVE COURT
Work for the Charlotte Alumni, at The Charlotte Observer's Fresh Air Camp, renovating the Carolina Inn, and repairing the road to Erwin Lodge were also suggested. Several projects for the improvement of the fraternity court were recommended. These included clearing undergrowth back of the road around the court, cleaning up along the banks of the stream, and digging holes along the road and on the court for planting shrubbery. Pledge classes may choose projects from this list or decide upon one of their own. They should notify Bob Waugh of their decision.

Skit Night will be on Wednesday, Feb. 1. The skits will be limited to seven minutes each and will be judged in the competition for the IFC trophy.

Librarian Warns Against Defacing
Miss Elizabeth Mayhew, order librarian and supervisor of the new reserve book system, has asked faculty members to warn their students not to mark up library books. Miss Mayhew said that there has been an increasing tendency on the part of a good many students to underline and otherwise mark up books this semester. She said that this was particularly true of books in the Reserve Reading Room. “Evidently the students do not realize that this is not only defacing college property but also very inconsiderate of others who must use the same books,” Miss Mayhew wrote in a report to the faculty.

Staples Says Rites Over Frosh Camp
“At this point, it doesn’t look like anything can be done to salvage Freshman Camp,” said College Chaplain George Staples this week. Final approval by the faculty of the Committee on Academic Scheduling’s recommendation for next year’s calendar apparently has canceled plans for the pre-school camp. Staples again explained the reasons why the Sept. 5 opening date for school will force the camp out of existence. He foresaw difficulties in getting a student staff and a place to meet over the Labor Day weekend. Another problem would be in arranging a faculty staff. “The Faculty retreat, which is held every year before school, is scheduled for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday before Labor Day,” said Staples. “This would at least partly run over into a Freshman Camp program.” Staples and the YMCA are planning to drop the idea of the camp, which was revived last year.

DON STOWELL as the Spirit of Poetry, “revived” last Wednesday and Thursday nights via the Vagabonds’ production. His “Revival” featured the reading of a number of poems and monologues, in an effort to revive the lost art of poetry.
