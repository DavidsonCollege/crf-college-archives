2 Pew grants allow research in humanities

By MARGARET CARROLL

Davidson College is now accepting applications from rising junior and senior humanities majors who would like to learn more about the intricacies of scholarly research through programs sponsored by the Pew Memorial Trust.

In 1986, Davidson College was awarded a grant from the Pew Memorial Trust to begin new programs which would enhance the senior year experience for majors in the Humanities departments (English, History, Philosophy, Religion, Foreign Languages, Art, Music, and Theater). Among other new programs made possible by the Pew grant is one which allows students to work during the summer as a professor’s research assistant.

Last summer, Alison Chapman and Sally Robinson participated in the Pew program. Chapman describes the program as an opportunity for “undergraduates to be exposed to the intricacies and depth of scholarly research.” Alison, who worked with Dr. Cynthia Lewis of the English department, researched a pseudo-historical look at drama in the Elizabethan era. Chapman conducted her research at the Duke University library, typed for Dr. Lewis, and added information to the research journal. Chapman enjoyed the program as a project “done by two people who share a common love for a subject and a mutual respect for each other.”

Robinson worked with Dr. David E. Shi of the History department in researching an American woman artist, Cecelia Beaux. Robinson searched index headings for relevant articles on Beaux and photocopied the information she uncovered. Robinson said that the project was “great, although tedious at times.” She was able to observe how the process of doing scholarly research operates; originally Dr. Shi was doing a magazine article on Cecelia Beaux, and now he has decided to write a book on the artist.

In order to apply for the Pew program, students should contact a professor in their major to see if that professor is interested, and if so, each should write a one-page application. The student’s application should describe his or her interest in the program, experience and skills related to the project, and should include a tentative work schedule. (The student may work for up to ten weeks.) The student’s stipend is up to $1800 and can include free on-campus housing. Applications for this summer’s program are due by March 1. Interested students should contact Dr. Shi, director of the program (phone ext. 271).

Burglars smash windows at Akers dormitory; mysterious female robs rooms in Richardson

By TRIPP HELMS

Two incidents of break-in and burglary took place in the period during and immediately following Christmas break, Davidson College Public Safety department officials said this week.

Windows were found broken in six Akers dormitory rooms on December 27 by an officer of the Public Safety department. Nothing was officially reported stolen, but some Akers residents have said that they are missing small amounts of loose change.

An unrelated string of robberies in Richardson dormitory took place on January 4. Eight residents reported a total of over $280 in cash missing from their rooms; a 24-hour bank card and a necklace were also stolen.

The broken windows in Akers were discovered by an officer on regular patrol at 9:23 p.m. The police searched the rooms, and nothing appeared to be missing. Chief of DavidsonSecurity Jackie Hughes surmises that the perpetrators were “casing the dorm” and planning to return later with a vehicle to rob the rooms. A special patrol was set up to keep watch on the dorm, and the driveway leading to the parking lot behind it was secretly marked so that the police would know if a vehicle passed through. No one returned that night; and the windows were nailed shut so that they could not be opened even if unlocked through a broken pane. “Students leave their rooms unlocked; they’re too trusting.” — Chief Jackie Hughes

Hughes says that Akers dorm is very vulnerable to break-ins because it is set back in the woods and is close to North Main Street. It is difficult to patrol the area because police Cushman scooters cannot ride behind the dorm, Hughes said. An officer must get out and walk behind the dorm to check it.

Director of Residence Life Tom Jennings says that “the installation of security screens on all first-floor windows is part of [his] long-range plan.” Hughes suggested the construction of a driveway behind Akers, Irwin, and Knox dorms and the placement of a security light.

The Richardson robberies of last Monday were committed by an unidentified female who was seen wandering on the third and fourth floors of the dorm. She knocked on freshman Delia Johnson’s door at about 10:00 a.m. and asked for “Robbie Howell,” according to Johnson. When she checked the student directory and did not find a Robbie Howell listed, Johnson called Campus Security. Hughes explained that the suspect's mode of operation was to knock on a door asking for a fictitious student; if there was no answer, she would enter the unlocked room and search for money. All of the rooms that were hit by the robber had been left unlocked. This is a major problem on campus according to Hughes and Jennings. “Students leave their rooms unlocked; they’re too trusting,” says Hughes. Hughes also reports that many dorm entrances are left propped open, rendering their combination locks useless against trespassers.

According to Jennings, there is about one major break-in on campus each year, usually over the holidays. During the Christmas holiday in 1986, someone broke into the Julia Johnson perimeter house. Residents returned from break to find their rooms ransacked and their doors and windows broken. Hughes states that the number of incidents of crime on campus is down this year. There have been 98 reports filed, compared with twice that many incidents reported at this time last year. “We have had a very good year,” he remarks, “but I’d better knock on wood when I say that.”
