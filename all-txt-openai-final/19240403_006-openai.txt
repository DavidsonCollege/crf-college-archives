THE DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 3, 1924

DAVIDSON FIVE YEARS AGO

Unusual interest has been shown on the golf course during the past week. The weather being excellent, afforded an opportunity
for the golfers to work on the handicaps before the tournament. Several of the players are expecting to go to
Charlotte soon to see the professionals, Jim Barnes, Mike Brady, Ed Fue, and Carl Anderson, play. Carl Anderson came to
Davidson and explained a few of the strokes to the club last year. Dr. Arbuckle is going to have two
of the professionals up here to give the club a few pointers and new strokes.

That long-hoped-for improvement is about to be realized, viz: the reconstruction of the tennis courts. Those who have seen the
rolls of chicken wire may have imagined that the college was going in for poultry farming, but the fact is
that the tennis courts are going to be put in shape for stopping a few of the wild shots instead
of necessitating a hundred-yard dash after each serve. Also, posts have been erected on the courts near the post office.
So all the artists of the racquet and sphere may take heart and anticipate an opportunity to indulge in this
pastime instead of waiting two hours to play 15 minutes.

O. J. Thies, ’18, of Charlotte, was on the hill one day last week.

Diamond Dust

Spann’s single in the ninth prevented the Wildcats from having a hitless day. Better look out for Currie and Clark.
They are extremely wild at times. Never mind, that is only temporary. They are going to make a nifty pair
of college twirlers. While “Dug” McArn was at the bat a feminine voice in the grandstand was heard to say,
“Cut out the Hoola Hoola, kid, and swat the pill.” “Crabby” Cravath, judging from his flow of language when soaked
in the ribs by one of “Buck” Currie’s fast shoots, has been rightly dubbed.

From the “Peanut Parcher”

He—If I stole a kiss would it be petty larceny?
She—No, I think it would be grand.

The Glee Club trip two weeks ago was such a success that it seems a shame to let talent of
so excellent a quality go to waste. For this reason two engagements have been made for next week; one on
Monday at Mitchell College and the other at Lenoir College on Tuesday night.

Spanish Night Success From Every Standpoint

Spanish Plays Enjoyed by Critical Audience

An unusual event of the past week was the rendering by the Spanish Club of a musical program and three
one-act plays. The performance took place Tuesday night, March 25th. The program consisted of the Spanish National Hymn, sung by
the entire club; A Child’s Story, told in Spanish by Miss Alice Jane Fleagle; La Golondrina, by a trio of
stringed instruments; La Paloma, a solo sung by C. F. Monk; Borinquen, by Watt McCain; La Bandera, Cancion de la
Mañana, La Terruca, by the club.

The three one-act plays were farces. The first one, La Cita de Amor was written by W. F. Galloway. It
is a breakfast table scene dealing with the difficulty which arose over the wife’s insisting that the husband tell how
much he loved her before she would serve his breakfast. Those taking part in it were: W. F. Galloway, A.
M. Martin, Wade Allison, and A. F. Simpson. The second play, El Espejo is a seventeenth-century farce. The action centers
around a simple servant, who seeing his mistress looking at herself in the glass thinks that she is flirting with
someone out the window. Those taking part in this play were: Austin, T. T. Jones, J. B. Thompson, E. C.
Douglas, and Forrest Franklin. The third play was El Joven Medico Infortunato. Those taking part in it were A. T.
Roe, Stewart, and Miss Frances Johnston. The concluding number of the program was the singing of O Davidson in Spanish,
French, German, Latin, Greek, and English.

Playing on a soggy field, under threatening clouds, the “Wildcat” diamond artists defeated the Oak Ridge preps in the second
of a two-game series on Richardson field, Saturday afternoon, winning 4 to 3. The contest, a gruelling affair, see-sawed back
and forth for seven innings, at which time Red McPherson, pitching for Davidson, scored Boushee with a long single to
center, winning his own game.

Potts, who pitched the earlier innings for Davidson, was relieved on the mound in the fourth by McPherson, who held
the Oak Ridge team scoreless for the remaining six innings. McPherson, pitching superbly, allowed his opponents only three scattered hits
during the six innings that he hurled.

Davidson started the scoring in the first inning, when Frank Alford banged out a homer with Smith on base. Alford
placed his hit just between center and right fields, and just out of reach of the opposing fielders. Oak Ridge
came back in the second frame, and tied the count. Wells got to first when Potts threw him four bad
ones, and Grimm singled. Both runners advanced on a passed ball, and then scored on McLean’s long single. A single
by Tomko, followed with a triple by Ross, gave the Ridgers a one-run margin in the third. Davidson lagged behind
until the fifth, when two singles and a perfect squeeze-play by Simpson brought across the tally needed to tie the
score. In the seventh, McPherson sent a hard drive to left field, scoring Boushee, and winning the game.

Ross, hurling for Oak Ridge, displayed an ability seldom equalled by prep school pitchers. He held the Davidson batters to
four hits, these being fairly well scattered. Captain Boushee, in center field for the Wildcats, made a number of fancy
catches, and vied with McPherson for first honors.

BROTHER OF DECK BOYS HURT IN AUTO ACCIDENT

The Davidson student body was sorry to learn Friday of the serious injury of Verdell Deck, brother of the Deck
brothers here now. Word was received that he had been seriously injured and L. L. Deck and L. C. R.
Deck left immediately thereafter for Atlanta. The former returned to Davidson Monday and the latter will come back within a
short time.

Young Deck, who is a student in high school, was en route to his school, when a little girl suddenly
came out in front of the car and in order not to hit her he swerved to the sidewalk. After
the impact with the fence, the car turned over, and as a result young Deck suffered a fractured skull and
other hurts. It was at first thought that he would not recover, but hopes are now entertained for his return
to health.
