ELECTION OF OFFICERS.

Shortly after the battle waged on Sprunt field last Saturday, there was another one fought at the Philanthropic Society in the election of officers for the first three months of next year. The society met at 7:15 and immediately went into the election of officers. The mantle of "Woody" Clark fell on R. D. Hall. May he be as efficient and as "peppy" an executive as the outgoing president—and we are sure he will, since he was elected by acclamation.

To lead the Junior Society next year along the flowery path of debating, D. M. Chalmers was elected, succeeding C. W. Worth, the present incumbent. There were several nominations for both secretary and treasurer, but the lucky men were—for secretary, R. C. Clontz, and for treasurer, F. L. Knight. W. M. Currie was elected first critic, and A. L. Foscue, second critic. For first supervisor, A. L. Currie was elected. For second supervisor, C. N. Morrison. There were several aspirants for the position of janitor, and after a good deal of voting and counting, the secretary announced that L. L. Wilson was the winner. The Debating Council chosen consists of the following: I. G. Lilly, W. M. Currie, and C. W. Worth. After the supervisor's, secretary's, and treasurer's reports—and several extemporaneous speeches by "Pebble," the society was adjourned by a unanimous vote of the house.

NEW MEN INITIATED.

One of the most interesting meetings of the Eumenean Society this year was held Saturday. Owing to the amount of other business on hand, the regular program was dispensed with. William Love read the new constitution of the society, which has been revised, modernized, and shortened. Then the new officers for next year were installed, with O. E. Flinn as president, William Love as vice-president, J. R. Boulware as secretary, and A. S. Potts as reviewer. Four new men were initiated: J. R. McKeldin, H. H. Massey, S. R. Harwell, and W. L. Roddey. Harwell and Roddey made their first argumentative efforts by debating on the question: "Resolved, That I am a better man than you are." No points were brought out on either side. McKeldin and Massey gave orations, Massey on the subject, "My Home Town," and McKeldin on Athens, Tenn. Massey informed the members of the society that he was from the country, so was ineligible for an oration on his subject.

MARION BOGGS SPEAKS AT THE JOINT MEETING.

Marion Boggs, '15, who is now in Union Seminary, addressed a joint meeting of the Christian Endeavor, Volunteer Band, and Ministerial Band, in Shearer Hall last Sunday evening. He chose the subject "Prayer," from Jas. 5:13-20. He emphasized the importance ofprayer, especially at the present time. He showed how prayer works miracles in the cleansing of the human soul, how it removes all obstacles in one’s way, and finally, that it increases faith. Everyone enjoyed the address.
