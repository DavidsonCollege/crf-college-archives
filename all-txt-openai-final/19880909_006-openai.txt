THE DAVIDSONIAN

For Dear ADVENTURE? or
B O the CARROT?

By Kevin McKenna

Before One Can Truly Understand
“The Court”, One Must Become
Acquainted with the Fraternity Language.

Of course, Court varies
the degree of enjoyment
for all walks of life.

You's understand this?
What are you
saying, B?

Court houses are also a great
place when you're really drunk.

They can get you crackin'
back.

Note: This does not encourage
activity of any kind, unless safe
sex is practiced. Then it's OK.
Chilly Willie + Cracker Jack were stolen property, too bad.

Peace for a show of brotherhood!

Of course, The Court is not
just for the lads but
for Davidson’s finest as well.

PROBLEM AREAS?
No Problem!
No food on
weekends! Get GAA
next semester.

Of course, not all houses
are for everybody. Some
houses may have too much.

One more time, WHERE
is your private favorite?

Court allows you to be a
part of the best of all, being on the
part of the Court that’s not like
part of the
Commons, which is
the “Piedmont Empire.”

THE UNDERGROUND

BY MICHAEL D. SCHILLER
Gonzo journalist and master of
disguise, MUAF goes undercover
as ARNOLD, working in the command
center to help celebrate the secret
life of CARLETON PRITCHARD,
POWER BROKER.

ARNOLD begins a rigorous training and indoctrination in a
branch of the Pritchard financial empire.

Watching the strict
Ray Kroc-like food standards
and baking in action—
Apple Pie!

Taste testing.

One evening, however, sent in
tooling for...

Here, behind the usual
industrial equipment, he
finds what the—nooo—

This is the necessary violation of the code of safe hangar. They don't want to see it—
This is the necessary violation of the code of safe hangar. They don't want to see it—
Burundi refugees chained in the
textile machines, slaving
in this secret underground
meat sack connecting the
Morgan-Omen branch
plant.

And when I
bore barreling nonsense
out the union men
and foot lick!
Any all witness sadder as
religion,
and control,
car washes... the weekend for car crime.

What is he talking about?!
