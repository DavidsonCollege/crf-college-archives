BSC. from page 1

When asked if the school had at least “some insincerity” in its recruitment of minority students, everyone in attendance raised their hands. When asked if the school is “more insincere than sincere” in its admissions tactics, a vast majority responded affirmatively. Finally, when the group was asked if they thought that the school is genuine in its intentions to heighten diversity, only one student raised her hand in agreement.

Yet the school insists that diversity remains a central goal. Davidson’s Statement of Purpose says, “As a college that welcomes students, faculty, and staff from a variety of nationalities, ethnic groups, and traditions, Davidson values its diversity and seeks to be a community that recognizes the dignity and inherent worth of every person.”

Despite such a seemingly earnest commitment to diversity and equality, Davidson admitted a record low number of minority students into this year’s freshman class. In addition to the drop from last year’s number of 19 percent of the entering class consisting of minority students, there are only 14 African-Americans in the class of 2006.

Assistant Dean of Students Ernest Jeffries attended the meeting and offered insight on the debate. In response to this year’s low minority admission rate, he told the group, “We hit rock bottom this year, and that is pathetic.” Jeffries also joined the group’s conversation on the middling state of interracial affairs on campus. “Everyone here has a prejudice,” he said later. “The bottom line is, we’ve got to start treating people like who they are, not who we think they ought to be.”

The crowd spent a bulk of the remaining time reflecting on Jeffries’s words, coming to the conclusion that the possibility for change necessarily hinges on both group and individual effort. Stated Lee, “What makes this college? The students. Where is the change going to have to start? With the students.”

Despite two hours of constructive conversation, all participants were fully aware that the struggle to bring change would not be easy and that it would not come quickly.
