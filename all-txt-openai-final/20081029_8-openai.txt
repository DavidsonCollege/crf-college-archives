Have you listened to WALT 1610 AM lately? As November rolls around, WALT’s Fall season is in full swing. Every
weeknight, WALT plays a full line-up of great music and the WALT E-board would like to take some time to
encourage you to tune in.

In a sense, this column comes in response, albeit a little late, to a February 21, 2007 staff editorial of
The Davidsonian which asked simply, “Is anyone listening?” to WALT. It asked why the station didn’t do more to promote
itself, and to increase its presence on campus. The rebuttal from WALT printed the next week was lukewarm, explaining that
students don’t casually tune-in to WALT like they would a commercial radio station. When given an opportunity to advertise the
station’s strengths, we at the WALT E-Board offered little justification as to why anyone would want to listen to what
we have to offer.

The truth is, there are a lot of great reasons to tune into WALT, and we would like to share
some of them with you. Why exactly should you tune in to WALT? Think about how much we listen to
music here at Davidson. All over campus, you see people wearing headphones, whether they’re cranking out problem sets in the
library, slogging through a late-night paper in the Union, working out in the fitness center or just walking to Chambers.
We’re playing a lot of music that we think you’ll enjoy.

A frequent misperception about college radio in general is that it only plays music that appeals to a small part
of a larger student audience, namely music snobs. Let me assure you, in the case of WALT, nothing could be
further from the truth. We can absolutely guarantee that you’ll hear music that you have never heard before, and that’s
because we get brand new CDs in the studio every week, many before they’re even actually released. And it’s your
friends that are playing them-- we have a knowledgeable, dedicated set of DJs offering programming across a huge array of
genres. In the past four years we have broadcast shows which feature Indie-Rock, Jazz, Thrash Metal, Soul, Political Commentary, Math-Rock,
Hip-Hop, Comedy, Reader’s Theatre, Punk, Top 40 pop, Electronica, Country, Bollywood and Sports Talk. In other words, there’s something for
everyone to enjoy here.

Looking for a show that will play your favorite songs? Check out our online broadcast schedule. You’re sure to find
something you like. Want to expand your musical horizons or explore a genre you’ve never heard before? Tune in to
WALT. There’s a good chance you’ll hear something that’s cool and different. We also receive dozens of new CDs directly
from record labels every week, so WALT is the place to turn when you want to hear the best tracks
from newly released albums. We also encourage you to check out our website, listentowalt.com, to see what our DJs are
listening to this week. This semester we’re on the air for 36 hours from Sunday through Friday, so whenever you
need a little music in your life, we’ll be there. Whether you’re hanging out with friends in your room, or
studying for aMidterm, WALT can provide the soundtrack for the moment. We, the E-board and DJs of WALT 1610 AM,
Davidson College Student Radio, hope you’ll take some time and listen.

Divided Government is Not the Answer
By ZEKE WEBSTER
Guest Writer

During his closing statement at the debate this weekend between the College Republicans and Young Democrats, College Republican Jenner Gibson
argued that voters should make John McCain president in order to preserve divided government. Given that Democrats currently control both
houses of Congress and are likely to expand their majorities in both chambers, the argument is that we should have
a Republican president in order to stop liberal overreaching.

This argument is a bit bizarre in that it admits that Democrats are wildly more popular with the American people
right now—Democrats with similar policy positions to Barack Obama, running against Republicans that largely agree with John McCain. And those
Democrats are, in fact, wildly popular: the pollsters are giving the Democrats around a one in three chance of reaching
a 60-vote supermajority in the Senate, which is a level of dominance not seen since the 1970s. Republicans still touting
the party line might want to think long and hard about why their party seems headed for the biggest electoral
rout in decades, and perhaps even consider the possibility that conservative government has failed because they have been pushing policies
that don’t work.

Still, this isn’t the biggest problem with the divided government argument. The value of divided government, according to Gibson, is
that it will force both sides into compromises and prevent ideological excess in either direction. In peaceful times, when we
just need to maintain good institutions competently, Gibson would be entirely right. Unfortunately, we are not in peaceful times. We
don’t need quiet stewardship, and divided government is the enemy of major changes in policy. Thanks to the Founders’ emphasis
on checks and balances, there are a tremendous number of ways to block reform, which have again and again stymied
major legislation, even when pushed by popular and powerful presidents shortly after landslide elections. Bills can languish in committee, they
can be filibustered, they can be vetoed, they can be rewritten into oblivion in conference committees, or they can be
struck down by the Supreme Court. Even with large majorities in both houses of Congress and control of the presidency,
passing major bills over the opposition of the minority party is incredibly difficult. This is why the biggest accomplishments of
domestic policy have been passed by undivided government.

Universal healthcare, or even a major healthcare reform bill, will not pass if John McCain is president. The amendments to
the Constitution abolishing slavery and providing suffrage and equality under the law to black men were passed by huge Republican
majorities and a Republican president. FDR passed Social Security with the support of a Democratic Congress; Lyndon Johnson passed Medicare
and the Voting Rights Act with the support of huge Democratic majorities in both the House and Senate. Historically, great
liberal reforms that have improved all of our lives could only happen in rare moments of massive Democratic dominance, and
today is no different. There is little doubt that the Republican Party will take every opportunity to stop Barack Obama’s
plans from becoming reality if he is elected. With John McCain as president, enacting these major reforms becomes basically impossible.
Comprehensive legislation to prevent climate change will be far less likely to pass if John McCain is president. The US
military will not withdraw from Iraq by 2010 if John McCain is elected, and we will be much less likely
to engage in talks with Iran that might resolve our conflicts with them over their nuclear program and other issues.

And here, of course, Gibson’s argument falls apart. The American people are poised to elect huge Democratic majorities in both
houses of Congress because the Democrats are promising to do all of these things. If the country didn’t want these
policies enacted, they would support Republicans in Congress. Why should Americans vote for McCain when he’ll prevent their votes for
Congress from accomplishing anything?
