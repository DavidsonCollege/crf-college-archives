#### Tibetan Monks to Perform, Speak as Part of South Asia Week
By Dack Stackhouse

Harry Houdini used to do it - sort of. He would escape from safes by holding the necessary tools in his throat, then bring them out by contracting his neck muscles. Tibetan Buddhist monks also strive to escape by using their throats. However, they seek to escape this world of suffering by using their vocal cords to sing sacred chants. A monk trains for years, eventually developing the ability to perform polytonal chants, in which he or she harmonizes with himself or herself. Although the singing is only one aspect of their practice, it is, nevertheless, a very amazing and important part.

At 7:00 in the 900 Room on February 15, as part of both South Asia Week and Solidarity Week, a group of Tibetan monks from the Gaden Shartse Monastery will be speaking about Tibetan culture and giving a demonstration of “The Awesome Voice.” No admission will be charged, and it promises to be a culturally enlightening event. The monks will talk about Ti-

#### Naked Guy Expelled from UC-Berkeley

BERKELEY, Calif. - A University of California at Berkeley student who wore little more than a smile around campus was expelled from school for violating public nudity and indecent exposure rules, a university spokeswoman said. Louis Andrew Martinez, 19, was sent a notification that he was expelled on Jan. 21, university spokeswoman Marie Felde said. He has an opportunity to appeal the expulsion, but must show new evidence or good cause to be allowed back into the school.

Martinez, dubbed the “Naked Guy,” was arrested twice in October for being on campus with little, if any, clothes on, and was suspended for two weeks in November. He was a sophomore and attended the Berkeley campus full-time. He usually wore only a pair of shoes and donned a daypack while he attended classes and walked around campus.

“He was given many opportunities to comply with our rules. He declined,” Felde said.

In September 1992, Martinez held a “nude-in” on campus and in front of hundreds of observers, Martinez and two dozen supporters stripped off their clothes. Martinez claimed that being nude on campus was a form of free expression. While he got some support at the rally, the campus police department received complaints from students and staff, said Lt. Bill Foley of the university’s security force.

Employees and students complained that they were forced to look at him in their offices and classrooms because they couldn’t get up and leave. Martinez also frightened some people when he jogged naked through residential dorm areas.

#### Blahs Lead to Blues

DAYTON, Ohio - Winter blahs actually can lead to the winter blues, says Judith Allik, associate professor of psychology at the University of Dayton. The dark, cold days of winter can result in seasonal affective disorder (SAD). SAD creates “a general sense of malaise,” according to Allik, and seems to strike women more often than men.

“January and February can be really rough for some people,” Allik said. “The symptoms don’t vary from general depression. You're apt to be lethargic. You’re apt to sleep more than you usually might. It might affect your appetite - you might eat more carbohydrates.”

If you can’t take a vacation to a sunnier spot, Allik suggested that exposure to bright lighting for several hours a day can help relieve symptoms. “Whenever there is sun, get outside and expose yourself to as much of it as you can. Take a walk,” she advised.

#### Student Objects to Slur

ORLANDO, Fla. - A University of Central Florida student dropped a class in Judaic studies because she said the instructor made a comment using the word “nigger” after she asked him a question, the campus newspaper reported.

Lynn Carswellsaid that she used the term “Old Testament” when asking instructor Joseph Gutmann a question, and he responded by telling her he found the reference offensive because it implied that the Jewish religion is outdated. “How would you like to be called a nigger?” he allegedly asked Carswell, who is African American. He then asked another African American student, Valerie Rozier, the same question. Gutmann, who is an adjunct professor, has apologized to the student, according to the University of Central Florida Future, the campus newspaper. The incident was being reviewed by the administration, the paper said.

Program Gives Women Boost

SELINSGROVE, Pa. - Women learn the ins and outs of corporate life long before they graduate from Susquehanna University. Every female freshman majoring in business is assigned a woman mentor who is a graduate of Susquehanna and successful in business. The program offers women the opportunity to learn skills and have contacts that the male students have access to, according to officials who designed the program. “The aim is to get women involved with mentoring early enough so that it can be useful in their career planning,” said Mary Cianni, assistant professor of management in the university’s School of Business. Twenty-one women are currently participating in the program, which requires that they meet with their mentors twice a year from their freshman year to their senior year. Cianni said the program also teaches women how to use social networks.

Higher Enrollment Expected

WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Education estimates that 16.1 million students will be enrolled in colleges and universities by 2003, up 14 percent from 14.2 million students in 1991. The projections are included in the department’s Projections of Education Statistics to 2003, which includes estimates on elementary, secondary, and postsecondary education. It is the first report on educational statistics that reflects 1990 Census population estimates and projections. The findings include projections that high school graduates will number 2.5 million for the next two years, which will be the smallest graduating classes since 1964-65. By 2003, the number is expected to rise 20 percent to 3 million. Teacher salaries are expected to rise 20 percent between now and 2003, and per student spending should rise 24 percent.

Union Planning Committee Formed
McMillen to Head Group, Explore New Union Options
By Tom Koonce

Administration officials have taken a small step towards building a new Union on the Davidson campus. This past week Dean of Students Will Terry asked twenty people to serve on a Union Planning Committee. The committee will be composed of mostly faculty and staff as well as some students. According to Terry, the charge of the committee “is to design a pragmatic scheme for a college Union outlining the specific spaces and services needed for the Union to accomplish its mission.” Terry said the committee will look at the “needs of the Union in light of the needs of the campus.” History professor Sally McMillen will chair this committee. She has experience with the Union from serving on the Union Board for the past four years. The primary responsibility of this committee is to update the facilities programming for a new College Union. This is a description of spaces and services needed in a new Union. Such a listing was last drawn up in 1990 by a similar planning committee. Union Director and member of the committee William Brown said that the committee will “take what was written in 1990, update it and make it a more accurate statement of what Davidson needs or wants.” Brown said that the committee will follow “a broad-based process to hear from as many people as possible.” According to Terry, the committee will bring in an outside consultant and will do a lot of on-site visits to other campuses in order to come up with ideas for the new Davidson Union. Brown said, “The committee needs everybody’s participation in the thought process.” Terry hopes that the committee will have completed its duties by the end of May of this year. The decision of whether or not to build a new Union will be made by the Facilities Planning Committee, the Development Office, and ultimately the President.
