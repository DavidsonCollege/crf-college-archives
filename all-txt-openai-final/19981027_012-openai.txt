Steinem warns against the oppression of sexuality

By Brett Simpson
Student Health Advisor

So, Gloria tells us to be sexual. What in the world does that mean? Does it mean we should entertain
our usual campus pastimes of streaking and manhandling intoxicated flesh? Or does it mean we should race out and claim
a mate? Clearly neither, but the majority of us seem to find difficulty in posing the appropriate questions and finding
the right answers. Why do we appear unable to enact our intelligence when dealing with this oftentimes cloaked part of
ourselves? Simply for the reason that we do keep this part of ourselves hidden. This harms not only us, but
also our relations with our friends and lovers. Confusion about sexual feelings can lead to inappropriate actions, redirected aggression, and
an unfulfilling void in what can be a very pleasant part of one’s life.

Familiar with sexuality and the social issues it addresses, Gloria Steinem is well aware of the detrimental effects of oppressed
sexual expression. Ms. Steinem encouraged us to unfetter the expression of our sexuality. If we can do this, we can
realize the pleasure, spirituality, and expressiveness offered by a healthy sexual lifestyle. The great thing about this is that you
can take this to whatever level you want. If you vehemently insist upon forcing half the campus to watch your
little buns streak across a lawn, then so be it. But, we'd rather advocate healthier sexual expression through relationships involving
emotional factors in addition to physical ones. In this way, we can learn how to please both ourselves and our
future partners, be they husband, wife, or lover.

So if you don’t already have a relationship that satisfies you, think about the myriad of benefits you can gain
and how little you can lose by calling the person you’re interested in. Life is a learning process, and this
is one challenge that will render more successful results if you begin sooner rather than later. You never know what
may happen.

Pianist McDermott will present Davidson Concert Series event

COLLEGE RELATIONS
Press Release

Virtuoso pianist Anne-Marie McDermott will present the second event in the Davidson College Concert Series on Monday, November 2. McDermott,
an artist member of the Lincoln Center Chamber Music Society, was featured recently on the Public Broadcasting System’s two-evening broadcast
of that group’s gala concert. She also recently completed two weeks as Resident Artist for National Public Radio’s “Performance Today,”
giving live performances and participating in discussions.

Her performance at Davidson will begin at 8 p.m. in Hodson Hall of Cunningham Fine Arts Building. It will include
Bach’s “English Suite” No. 2 in A Minor; Beethoven’s 32 Variations on an Original Theme in C Minor, and Sonata
in E Flat Major, Op. 31, No. 3; Chopin’s Sonata No. 3 in B Minor, Op. 58; and Rachmaninov/Kreisler’s “Liebeslied”
and “Liebesfreud.” Tickets are $12 for adults, $8 for seniors and students. Please call 892-2116 any time, or 892-2135 between
2:30-5:30 p.m. weekdays for more information.

A boldly emotive pianist, McDermott is widely celebrated for her expressive performances. She began playing piano at age 5, and
at age 12 performed with the National Orchestra Association at Carnegie Hall. She was a scholarship student at the Manhattan
School of Music, and won the 1983 Young Concert Artist Auditions and the 1987 Avery Fisher Career Development Award. Since
that time she has won the 1995 Andrew Wolf Memorial Chamber Music Award, the Joseph Kalichstein Piano Prize, the Paul
A. Fish Memorial Prize, the Bruce Hungerford Memorial Prize, and the Mortimer Levitt Career Development Award for Women Artists.

McDermott has earned a reputation as one of the major talents of her generation. She made her debut with the
New York Philharmonic in March 1997, and has performed with many major orchestras in the finest concert halls of the
world. Well-known also as a chamber musician, she appears regularly at many festivals, including Spoleto, Bravo! Colorado, Ravinia, Newport, and
the Dubrovnik Festival. Following her Davidson concert, she will perform for three evenings in Lumberton, Southern Pines, and Chapel Hill
with the North Carolina Symphony. Another highlight of her coming season will be a tour of Japan with violinist Nadja
Salerno-Sonnenberg.
