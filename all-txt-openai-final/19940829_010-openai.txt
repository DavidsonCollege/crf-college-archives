#### Album Review

**Rachel loves Neil Young**
By Rachel Newcomb

It is seldom that Rolling Stone magazine bestows the honor of a five-star review on an album. Over the years,
I’ve seen only a few records receive this accolade—usually old blues compilations or previously unreleased Jimi Hendrix tracks. So you
can imagine the surprise and anticipation I felt when a cartoonish drawing of Neil Young appeared beside the featured review
in this past month’s issue, along with that rarest award—five stars.

I bought the CD the day it came out, edging my car through traffic as quickly as possible in my
eagerness to get home and find out why this album was deserving of five stars. At first, I was puzzled.
It has taken longer for *Sleeps With Angels* to grow on me than for most of his other albums. Neil
Young has many different voices, and while one can draw comparisons between some of his albums, each record is absolutely
distinct. Rather than assuming a record company’s vision as his own, Young himself produces and writes the majority of his
work. At times, this makes his records seem almost a personal chronicle of his life and a reflection of the
world as he sees it.

And the world, as Neil writes about it on *Sleeps With Angels*, is not a very hospitable place. On *Sleeps
With Angels*, Young has gone back to working with Crazy Horse, his backup band well-versed in the art of distortion
and loud, ferocious rock and roll. Nothing about this album contains remnants of the soft, folk-tinged contentment on *Harvest Moon*.
If anything, Neil draws from the same creative well of discontent from which 1989’s burning epic *Freedom* flowed.

It wasn’t what I expected, but after several listens, I found *Sleeps With Angels* to be yet another quirky, yet
richly rewarding triumph for Young. Always a fan of cutting-edge music like Nirvana, Young had met Kurt Cobain and respected
his work. A veteran of a personal battle with drug abuse himself, Young tried to call Cobain after Cobain’s drug
overdose a few weeks before his suicide this past spring. Young was unsuccessful, and in a suicide note, Cobain quoted
one of Young’s lyrics: “It’s better to burn out / Than to fade away.”

*Sleeps With Angels*, the title cut on the CD, is a highly personal response to Cobain’s life and death. Amid
distorted, angry guitars, Neil whispers the plaintive chorus: “He sleeps with angels / (Too soon) / He’s always on someone’s
mind.” The whole record paints a disturbing portrait of the world as Young sees it, an environment which was too
painful and meaningless for Cobain to find happiness in.

The album opens with “My Heart,” a short lament to missed opportunities and the dream of a better place and
time, all sung to the hollow plink of an old-fashioned honky-tonk piano. In “Driveby,” Young comments on the random violence
which is increasingly becoming part of everyday life in America, with a soft chanting chorus of “driveby, driveby” hanging ominously
in the background. I particularly like the constant sliding bass note running throughout “Safeway Cart,” another haunting vignette on the
realities of day-to-day existence. In “Trans Am,” Neil displays a remarkable yet disjointed storytelling ability with several surreal narratives centered
around an old car. My favorite cut on the album is...

### THE ODYSSEY: An Adventure of Epic Proportions
By Jenn Schuetz and Jonathan Brooks

Rain, moleskin, some sun, and Ben and Jerry’s... all a part of the unique experience of the Odyssey. Eighty freshmen
and a handful of staff members participated in this year’s pre-orientation trip with Davidson Outdoors.

What is the Odyssey? Many freshmen sign up for the Odyssey to meet fellow classmates or simply to get into
the woods for five days. Upon the conclusion of the trip, they may discover new perspectives on how to live,
communicate, and have fun. Working together hiking, paddling rivers, and preparing food for the group build a sense of trust
and camaraderie among the group members. After a few days in the mountains, the group which had previously been unacquainted
with its members is at once a cohesive pack. After learning to work together for an entire week, the tight
crew then participates in a service project at the end of the week. This offers an opportunity for the group
to work towards a common goal and introduces...The freshman to the service-oriented aspect of Davidson. Additionally, the program offers an
atmosphere in which students may be introduced to faculty and staff. William Brown, the director of the college union, both
benefited from and rewarded the group of which he was an integral part. Davidson Outdoors hopes to build its staff
participation in future years. Dr. David Grant, professor of Biology, participated in the program and finds that the staff participation
eases the incoming students’ transition into college. Marlys Daugherty, co-director of Davidson Outdoors, expressed that the Odyssey program offers a
unique experience for freshmen in which they develop interpersonal skills through their interaction with other Davidson students and staff in
a small group outdoors. This assists their relations to the larger Davidson community upon their return.

The trip leaders also benefit from the experience as they learn to delegate responsibilities, act as facilitators for the group,
and interact with incoming students. Lillian Roe, a current Davidson Outdoors leader, recounts her freshman experience, explaining, “It cushioned the
transition into college. I left for school anxious, excited, nervous... and the Odyssey allowed me to meet other people who
had the same feelings, and it helped me learn how to relate to new situations and new people. After my
freshman Odyssey, I had a great deal of confidence in myself. I survived a week living tightly with eleven other
people and made some of my best friends in college.”

We spent the first day of Odyssey at the lake campus, playing games, swimming, and celebrating the birthdays of three
participants. The groups then camped out at the lake campus and left in their respective crews in the morning. Eight
groups of twelve left early in the morning bound for the mountains and rivers. Four crews spent their time hiking,
rafting, and canoeing on the Chattooga River, while the other four crews enjoyed trips to the French Broad and Nolichucky.
Ed Daugherty, co-director of Davidson Outdoors, recognizes this year’s Odyssey as “the smoothest trip, due to the abilities and confidence
of the trip leaders." The trip was enhanced as logistics crews were stationed at different outposts to bring food, fuel,
and gear to groups on the trail. The recent tropical storm caused water levels to rise on rivers, ensuring exciting
trips for all the groups. With water levels incredibly high, the current hustled along and the white water fun never
stopped. Jonathan Brooks and Ann Dupre Rogers had an exciting experience rafting section three of the Chattooga with a guide
who had twenty years of experience on the river. With the water at dangerous levels on the famous Bull’s Sluice
run, their group ran off-line and took a dangerous backwards spill down the wrong slide. The guide, with...
