THE DAVIDSONIAN, October 30, 1919

Who, What and Where Among the Alumni

Dr. J. M. McConnell a Factor of Great Import in Up-

At a recent meeting of the Norfolk Presbytery, Rev. T. C. Bales, ‘11, was moderator, and Rev. T. H. Dimmock,
'29, was on the hill last week. It was he who stepped into the breach and taught Senior English. By
his scholarly erudition, his painstaking care, and his facile adaptability, he has won the admiration of all who have studied
under him. Always progressive, always having the welfare of the students as his first consideration, Dr. McConnell is a factor
of large import in the life of the college.

PERSONAL MENTION.

Chaplain E. L. Flanagan, ’07, has accepted the pastorate of the Presbyterian Church at Wilson, N. C.

Mr. O. G. Cellar, of Jacksonville, Fla., spent several days on the hill with his son.

GO TO IT, SCRUBS.

The Scrubs invade foreign territory Saturday when they travel up to Bingham Military School. They have been working hard all
the year and their blood is boiling for a fight. It will be remembered that in 1917 Bingham defeated Davidson
Scrubs, and revenge is in their hearts. Bingham, as usual, has one of the best preparatory school teams in the
south, and a hard battle is expected.
