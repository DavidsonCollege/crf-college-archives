THE DAVIDSONIAN

If an accident occurs while your car is traveling under 40 miles an hour, there is only one chance in
44 that someone will be killed. This statement is based on official state reports recently analyzed by The Travelers Insurance
Company.

If an accident occurs while your car is traveling over 40 miles an hour, however, there is one chance in
10 that someone will be killed. The moral: Death begins at 40!

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

ON FOOTBALL SPIRIT

We heartily agree with your editorial on Davidson spirit, "Dear Andy." This does not mean we favor overemphasis of football,
or any other athletics. But we do believe that so long as Davidson continues to meet other groups in competition,
whether on the gridiron, diamond, or court (sophisticates will laugh here) in the debate parlors, that the rest of the
students should show some interest. If our upperclass "dealers" would stoop so low as to evidence some sort of interest
in our representatives on the field, then Davidson's spirit would rise once more.

The facts must be faced squarely. Either we become interested in what goes on at Davidson (which includes athletic events),
or we sink farther into our apparently much desired self-sufficient attitude. Is that what we want to be a Davidson
characteristic and tradition? If it is, we are doing splendidly, and should worry no further about the matter. But if
the contrary is true, then we had better do something at once. And this "something" means talking up the team,
becoming interested in them.

Which way shall we go? Or will we laugh it off and forget about it?

Action Needed

This week's "Question of the Week" asks whether or not a new Alma Mater is needed for our school. Various
reasons were offered both for and against the proposed change, and we ask that the musical department and administrative branch
of the college give serious consideration to the matter.

Last year there was a good bit of talk about this subject, but nothing came of it. It was discussed
pro and con and the majority of the students seemed to think it would be a good idea, but still,
nothing was done.

Of course, there may be some serious objection to having an Alma Mater for Davidson. But if there is, we
fail to see it. Other schools have their football songs, peppy and fast, but they also have dignified Alma Maters.
"Pep songs" are necessary for the gridiron, but an Alma Mater is a different thing. When the band plays "O,
Davidson" after each touchdown, and several other times during the game, somehow it seems out of place to have it
at the half as a traditional school song, although that is what happens. During graduation or other ceremonious occasions, our
football song seems sometimes inappropriate. An Alma Mater would not. Davidson should have a dignified, appropriate Alma Mater, which would
become a tradition on the campus, such as other Alma Maters have at other schools.

To Upperclassmen

Thirty-six upperclassmen attended last Friday night's Pep Meeting at the gym! The fact that as many as thirty-six upperclassmen would
be present at such a time will probably surprise many, but it should be a matter of wonder that so
few were there. Davidson's upperclassmen number about 300, which means that less than 13 percent were present. Most students, after
their freshman year, forget that Pep Meetings exist, unless they happen to be passing and are attracted by the noise.
Certainly, there are very few who take the slight trouble to walk down to the gym from their room or
fraternity house, especially to attend a Pep Meeting, and even those few who do go rarely bother to open their
mouths. It has recently become a custom to let the freshmen bear the whole burden of giving the team a
pre-game cheer on Friday night.

We hear that our spirit is definitely on the wane because football interest is low. We hear that the freshman
class is terrible because they will not support the team better. We see our cheering on Saturday weakening, even when
the team plays over its head. And the freshmen get the blame.

But the fault is not theirs primarily. The fault lies with Davidson’s high and mighty upperclassmen, not the freshmen, and
it is high time that upperclassmen realized that it is themselves who should be censored. When the upper classes fall
down, they influence the new men the same way. And that is as far as the freshmen can be blamed.

Time was when football was a major topic of discussion at bull-sessions, at meals, and at odd times. That seems
to have passed. Football and the team have been relegated to a place of minor importance. Many go to every
game to which they can, but it is not for the same reason as before, but to attend some social
gathering afterward. Davidson’s upperclassmen, in the midst of their bored and sophisticated self-sufficiency, seem to consider it beneath their dignity
to think of our representatives on the athletic field. And that is why our spirit is decaying.

Of course, this does not apply to all upperclassmen here, but evidence seems to point to the fact that a
majority care nothing at all about what happens to the football team, or even whether they play, so long as
there is a dance or similar function afterward. Football is nice if it doesn’t interfere with other plans for the
weekend.

During our freshman year, there was a different atmosphere on the campus during football season. There was wholehearted support for
the team. Now, it seems that the players can sleep.Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and
punctuation:

MONDAY AND TUESDAY
Oct. 10, 6 Oct. 13 and 14.

"ARGENTINE NIGHTS" Ritz TRU UP THE BAND" — Brothers and the Andrew Sisters.) Mickey Rooney, Judy Garland, The Andrew sisters
add music Paul Whiteman and Orchestra.

"It seems impossible for Rooney to reach such heights but he and Garland definitely go over the top. The plot
is centered around South America where life is fast with a new musical hit that has everything. Paul Whiteman and
his great jazz band furnish the music for the song hits and Judy sings them better than ever. Really a
great musical show.

FRIDAY
Oct. 11 and 12.

"THE SEA HAWK" Errol Flynn, Brenda Marshall and Flora Robson. This is definitely one of the best shows of the
year with Flynn playing the part of the bold pirate. He endears himself to the Queen because of his bold
and carefree life. His boldness is cut short when he falls in love with Brenda Marshall and runs afoul of
the Spanish Armada. Intrigue, suspense, colorful backgrounds and a magnificent cast make this a "must."

WEDNESDAY
Oct. 15.

"CALLING ALL HUSBANDS" No dope could be secured about this show but don't forget that Wednesday is bargain day and
two shows will be shown at that time. Due to the fact that the movies were not given until very
late, we are unable to give a minute description of all the shows.

Song Of The Sirens
By JULIEN M’CALL and LOUIS WHITE.

Almost anybody capable of tossing off a vocal chorus is called a stylist these days, and almost nobody really is
one. Billie Holiday is, though. Whether it’s her Tell Me More, a throaty torch piece, or Laughing at Life, a
sprightlier item, you'll find Miss Holiday ad-libbing around the tune. An unnamed orchestra supplies accompaniments that are neither too obtrusive
nor too subdued, which helps matters along nicely.

Ray Noble and his orchestra are gradually but surely working toward the top as a virtuoso ensemble. You'll find plenty
of expression and finish in Rhythm On the River and That's For Me. Gene Krupa’s Tonight, also known as Perfidia,
is given a remarkably interesting performance in which the high spots are the use of trombones against the voice of
Howard Du Lany. Never Took a Lesson in My Life is the accompanying piece with Irene Day on the vocals.
Jimmy Dorsey's sweet, moody stuff in Dolimite and his Hep-Tee-Hootie, a torrid swing number, have become one of the must-numbers
in anybody's album. Woody Herman, musically, is right on top, but the public hasn't yet realized that this band is
the equal of any in the country. The fine work on Get Your Boots Laced, Papa, a double-sided killer-diller is
a tribute to the hard work.
