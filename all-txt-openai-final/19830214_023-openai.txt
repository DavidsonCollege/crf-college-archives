Every now and then a film comes along that is so profound, so well done, that Davidson should require its students to see it. *Citizen Kane* is an example, and Tuesday’s “Movie at Perkins,” *Dr. Strangelove*, also falls heartily into this category. Some have called *Dr. Strangelove* the funniest film ever made, and it may be just that. Stanley Kubrick’s comic adaptation of Peter George’s serious novel *Red Alert* takes the hardened subject of nuclear war and turns it into a Marx Brothers circus. What makes *Dr. Strangelove* so important, however, is that it never forgets its horrifying theme of nuclear war. It not only entertains but enlightens.

The film’s complete title suggests the parody element pretty blatantly, but that’s the only unsubtle thing in *Strangelove*. Opening with a beautiful phallic symbol of two B-52s refueling in the sky all set to some dreamy music, *Dr. Strangelove* immediately grabs our attention and makes us question; maybe that’s the point of the entire film. We question a government which is run by an insane general named Jack D. Ripper. We question when this maniac orders a complete attack on Russia headed by Slim Pickens. We question when we find out that Slim Pickens’s character is named Major Kong (nicknamed “King”), and when we hear Kong say things like, “After all this is over there’ll be awards and personal citations for every one of yuh, regardless of your race, color, or creed.” We question when George C. Scott, as Major “Buck” Turgidson, makes comments like, “I’m not saying we won’t get our hair mussed — give or take 20 or 30 million lives.” And finally, we question when we see Peter Sellers, as the good doctor, violently fighting his artificial hand from going into a “Heil Hitler” salute. Not only does one question, but one also laughs his head off.

In 1963, the wunderkind filmmaker Stanley Kubrick fished around for another film to make. Having just finished his misguided yet effective *Lolita*, Kubrick read Peter George’s book *Red Alert* and arranged with the author to write a screenplay based on his novel. However, the more Kubrick and George worked on creating a film, the harder they laughed. As Kubrick himself said, “It’s all so ridiculous — a joke.” He and George decided to make *Red Alert* into a comedy and call it *Dr. Strangelove or . . . (you know)*. Kubrick called his hilarious friend Terry Southern, and the three concocted this brilliant bit of hysteria and subsequently went into film history next to Charlie Chaplin and Groucho Marx.

*Dr. Strangelove* overflows with brilliant performances, perhaps the greatest ensemble of acting ever on a piece of celluloid. Stainless Stanley resurrected Sterling Hayden from trashy B-movie hell to give the performance of his lifetime (probably anyone’s lifetime), as the half-insane, half-sex maniac, all-paranoid Jack D. Ripper. He grins, frowns, and spouts redundancies better than even Jack Nicholson. George C. Scott displays his rarely tapped comic genius as General Buck Turgidson, a political, sexually aggressive, patriotic buffoon who hates commies. Keenan Wynn also gives a notable supporting role as “Bat” Guano (ar ar), a Coke machine assailant who is always on the guard against Russian “preverts.”

In the end, however, *Dr. Strangelove* is Peter Sellers’s film. Playing three roles — the title character, the bald-pated President, and a bumbling officer — Sellers is in almost every frame of the film. As Captain Mandrake, he reminds us of the bumbling Clouseau, listening intently to Ripper.as he rambles on about “precious bodily fluids.” As President Muffley, Sellers is virtually unrecognizable. With a pluperfect American accent and a consistent personality, he gives one of the finer performances of his career. Finally, as the Werner von Braun type, Dr. Strangelove, Sellers really steps into the limelight. He contorts, spins maniacally about in his wheelchair, and his periodically spastic, Nazi-influenced artificial hand is a convulsive laugh meter.

The Great Soul Gandhi (1983)
Produced (it took 20 years!) and directed by Richard Attenborough. Starring Ben Kingsley, Roshan Seth, Martin Sheen, Candice Bergen, John Mills, Trevor Howard, and John Gielgud. Rating: ***

Mohandas K. Gandhi was one of the greatest men of the 20th century. Accordingly, the film Gandhi has many pretensions of greatness and at times succeeds. Richard Attenborough’s $22 million epic carefully and accurately depicts the life of Gandhi, but that is all it does. Nowhere is there any style to Gandhi and what technique there is seems to be lifted from classics like Dr. Zhivago, Reds, and The Bridge on the River Kwai. The fact is, David Lean and Warren Beatty can tell a much better story than Richard Attenborough. Yet in spite of this, Gandhi remains engrossing, and for those who know little about the man, ultimately enlightening.

The film begins with the assassination of the Mahatma and then flashes back to his younger days. The first few sequences are among the best, with the viewer never actually seeing Gandhi until he is shot. But even this death sequence is not nearly as effective as it could have been. The opening of Lawrence of Arabia—from which Gandhi seems to have been lifted—was far more striking. Gandhi’s younger days are well done—often hilarious—and they alone stand out as solid filmmaking. However, the second half of Gandhi just about falls apart, with Gandhi threatening again and again to starve himself. By about his third death threat, I didn’t care anymore and almost hoped he would do it and get everything over with. Gandhi resembles more of a good Life magazine article than a good movie.

As Gandhi, Ben Kingsley is obviously devoted to his role. He bears a striking resemblance to a small-time lawyer who changes a nation. However, all the media hype has, unfortunately, overshadowed equally good portrayals by Roshan Seth as Nehru and Rohini Hattangady as Gandhi’s wife. Martin Sheen is wasted as the reporter, but Ian Charleson scores again in film as the young Catholic priest. As the Life magazine reporter, Candice Bergen is Candice Bergen, and her clothes and hairstyles hardly seem like 1948. Perhaps, however, the main problem with Gandhi is that the parts of the film that are unwieldy are just so because Gandhi’s own life at that time was unwieldy. In the end, however, Richard Attenborough appears to have made a very good documentary on a fascinating man, but not a fascinating movie.

A display chronicling major events and influences in the life of Mohandas K. Gandhi is hanging in the Davidson College Gallery. Professor of South Asian Studies Job Thomas and his wife gathered photographs and text for the exhibit, which includes pictures of the Mahatma that have never before been publicly displayed. The show includes pictures and passages from two of Gandhi’s philosophical mentors—Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau. Gandhi applied tenets of Transcendental philosophy, particularly Thoreau’s belief and practice of civil disobedience. Gandhi in turn was a spiritual mentor of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, and the display touches on the tactics of civil disobedience he encouraged for the civil rights movement. The display gives one a wide historical understanding of Gandhi, for the Mahatma lived ideals that can liberate humans regardless of the particular circumstances. Gandhi called for the assertion of our human dignity, and, as Dr. Job Thomas stresses, “Gandhi's philosophy is still valuable today.”
