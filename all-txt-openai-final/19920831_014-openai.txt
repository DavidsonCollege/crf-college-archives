As the offense is, Davidson’s defense, which will feature an eight-man front, may be stronger in both areas. The ‘Cats
have nine starters coming back for the '92 campaign.

Junior defensive end Billy Evans, last season’s Defensive MVP, made 84 tackles, recovered two fumbles, and recorded seven and a
half quarterback sacks. Junior linebacker John Dalton contributed 83 tackles, a pair of fumble recoveries, and the ‘Cats' lone safety
in ’91.

Other defensive stalwarts should be senior linebacker Martin McCann, who made 76 tackles and notched three sacks, sophomore linebacker Chris
Leak, who added 56 tackles and five sacks, and Fighting Wildcat Club Players of the Year junior cornerback Alden Smith,
who intercepted five passes, and senior Leonel Benoist, who made 43 tackles and broke up three passes.

As the club understands, the special teams must perform for the ‘Cats to achieve overall success. Junior Drew Fassett boosted
his punting average to 38.5 yards a kick last season, and he nailed 16 of 21 extra-point attempts. His field
goal against Washington and Lee proved to be the difference in the 16-14 conquest of the Generals.

Smith will continue to be the key man on the return team units. His 525 kickoff return yards and 187
punt return yards were easily team highs in ’91. Junior Chad Blackwelder’s talents, which included snapping, earned him Special Teams
MVP and Fighting Wildcat Club co-Player of the Year honors.

Fagg is particularly pleased with the newcomers’ progress in the three weeks since fall camp began. “We have twenty men
in the class of '96, and I can already tell it will be an exceptional class,” he said.

Defensive backs Tom Bannister, Will Robinson, and Charles Staples and defensive ends Bo Bartholomew and Tony Frye have proven themselves
early, as have wide receivers Jon Bridges and Tom Haynie and quarterback Happy O’Brien.

For the time being, the ‘Cats will select captains on a game-by-game basis. Fenwick and Loyd will share offensive duties,
McCann will be defensive captain, senior Matt Matheny will captain the special teams, and Benoist will be “Captain Crazy”.

Though he understands that his squad still needs more time to prepare for the Quakers, Fagg insists that “we’re on
schedule right now.”

Found a leader in Hathaway’s replacement at setter, sophomore Lorie Logan. “I think Lorie is definitely going to step into
that role,” Blake said. “She has just the right personality to be a setter.” Junior Jennifer Guise will back up
Logan at setter.

Up front, the Wildcats should be led by outside hitters Jennie Wagner, Amy Howard, and Janet Delery. Wagner and Howard
were named co-MVPs at the conference tournament last year. Wagner also contributes on the back line, where she led the
team in digs a year ago. Blake also anticipates an immediate contribution at outside hitter from 5’10" freshman Michele Augustin,
who has experience in the Junior Olympics. 6’0" junior Katherine Anderson will be the ‘Cats’ chief middle blocker; senior Rachel
Thompson will have a valuable role as defensive specialist. In the past, she often has replaced blockers in the back
row to give the team a stronger defensive presence.

The schedule will be a bit tougher this year because Davidson will meet a full slate of Southern Conference opponents
for the first time. Last year, the Wildcats went 1-2 against the Southern, with a win against Furman and losses
to Appalachian State and East Tennessee State. Blake, though, is not all that concerned about the regular season. “The important
thing for us is to be real patient early on,” she said. “Our goal is really our conference tournament.”
