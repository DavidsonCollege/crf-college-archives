THE DAVIDSONIAN ARTS MONDAY, OCTOBER 11, 1993

Mellencamp's music evolves into mature "Human Wheels"

John Mellencamp deserves credit for doing more than just sticking around. It’s been over a decade since the song “Jack
and Diane” made him a “rising star” with the likes of such forgettable flashes as Laura Branigan and Soft Cell.
Back then he was John Cougar, and his specialty was rousing pop anthems about life in the Midwest. What separated
him and a small handful of others from the newcomers of the early 80s was his talent. He had a
lot of it, unlike the one-hit wonders and half-baked acts that got in line to collect their 15 minutes of
fame.

Now he prefers to be called by his real name, John Mellencamp. After a few listens to his new album,
Human Wheels, I'll call him whatever he requests. His music, like his name, has evolved slowly—almost imperceptibly—into something new. Thirty
seconds of the opening song, “When Jesus Left Birmingham,” should be proof enough. Its drums are muted, restrained, and funky—in
other words, the exact opposite of the boom of “Small Town.” His rusty whispers of “When Jesus left Birmingham all
the disciples went crazy...” are preceded by spooky gospel moans and a mandolin riff. This is definitely not the same
man who used to just “hurt so good.”

The tight sound of Human Wheels is the most notable break from his previous work. Though he is still working
with many of the same musicians that he worked with in the 80s, Mellencamp has the sounds they make under
more control than before. The drums are crisp, the vocals are hushed, and all the other instruments are used only
when needed. The sound is funky, but somehow intimate—much like U2’s Achtung Baby, but without as much excess noise. In
“Junior,” the simple rhythm is shaker. “Sweet Evening Breeze” begins with acoustic guitar but soon kicks into a chaotic beat
accentuated by moaning electric guitars. It’s an example of Mellencamp turning away from any traces of his past.

His lyrics are a similarly radical and conscious departure from the past. For “Beige to Beige,” a commentary about the
subtlety of modern racism, he ironically pulls out such folksy instruments as a fiddle and penny whistle while declaring, “Charlie’s
gonna look out for you—you just do what’s expected of you.” The imagery used for “Case 795 (The Family),” as
a man murders his wife, is stunning: “He left her bleeding on the floor in the kitchen with cake on
her fingers and her wedding ring holding.” The intensity of his lyrics is contained perfectly in the tight, sparing arrangements
of the music.

While I will admit that Human Wheels is not necessarily the best album in the Mellencamp catalog, it does show
that the man can still make good music. And even more surprising, Human Wheels proves that, at over 40 years
of age, an individual can continue to mature.

On all their songs this group seemed to charge things up with a unique flair.

In November you can see Li’l Ed and the Blues Imperials, and in December come for Drink Small. If you
missed the Manic Moodswings last Monday and want to see them don’t worry. Creative Loafing lists the different places that
they play throughout each week.

Blues Monday usually costs about a dollar, and you can become a member of the Intimate Performances Club by seeing
three acts. Your fourth performance is then free. The Union is also selling Blues Monday T-shirts for $10.

As the Manic Moodswings write more and more of their own songs they hope to record a few demo tapes.
Bostian hopes the band might make it into the studio sometime within the next three weeks. For the most part,
however, if you want to catch more great blues groups in the 900 Room you’re in luck.
