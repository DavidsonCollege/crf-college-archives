The Davidson Wildcats opened regular season play in front of a sold-out crowd of 5,223 in Belk Arena Friday night
as they defeated the Guilford Quakers 107-83. Stephen Curry ’10 led the ’Cats to victory with a double-double consisting of
29 points and 10 assists while he fell just one steal short of tallying a triple-double which would have been
only the second triple-double in Davidson history. Andrew Lovedale ’09 matched his career high with 16 points and also brought
down five rebounds. Brendan McKillop ’11 also notched a new career high in points with 14 while Bryant Barr ’10
scored 11 of his own. Max Paulhus Gosselin ’09 played tough defense as he recorded eight steals to go along
with his nine points.

Turnovers contributed to Davidson’s considerable victory as the Wildcats recorded a school record of 25 steals and forced a total
of 39 turnovers. Davidson defeated the Quakers by a 55-12 margin in points off turnovers.

Fresh off the opening-night victory, the ’Cats traveled to Norman, Okla. where they participated in the Dick’s Sporting Goods NIT
Season Tip-Off. In the first round, Davidson defeated James Madison by a score of 99-64. Curry played another outstanding game
as he scored 33 points while he also dished out nine assists and recorded four steals. Four other Wildcats scored
in double figures. The night’s top performers included Barr with 12 points, Steve Rossiter ’10 with 10 points, Lovedale with
10 points and 11 rebounds, and McKillop with 10 points as well. Lovedale’s performance earned him his third career double-double.
Davidson shot the ball extremely well from long range, making 10 of 25 on three-point attempts. As a team, Davidson
also shot 58.5 percent from the field. Curry was 14 of 19 from the floor and four of six from
behind the arc. His excellent shooting along with the great defense and consistent play of the team helped Davidson defeat
the JMU Dukes with ease.

With these two great performances, Curry earned SoCon Player of the Week honors as he averaged 31 points, 9.5 assists,
and 6.5 steals over this span. He received this award partially because of his excellent shooting, hitting 59 percent from
the field and 46.7 percent from three-point range.

The victory over the Dukes allowed the Wildcats to advance to a primetime second-round matchup with the no. 14 Oklahoma
Sooners on their home court. The Wildcats struggled, shooting only 35 percent from the field and three-point land, and suffered
their first loss of the season by a narrow margin of 82-78. The ’Cats were led back from a deficit
of as much as 21 points to a margin of only three by the terrific play of Curry, who posted
his career high in points with 44 on 12 of 29 shooting from the field and six of 15 from
three-point range. Curry’s efforts were not enough for the Wildcats to beat the Sooners as the next leading scorer was
Lovedale who only tallied 10 points. Other top scorers included Will Archambault ’10 who scored seven points and Rossiter who
finished the night with six. The lack of point distribution hurt the ’Cats in this one as Oklahoma posted a
three-man attack which Davidson was unable to slow down. Blake Griffin scored 25 points and dominated the boards bringing down
21 rebounds including a crucial offensive rebound in the last minute of the game which thwarted Davidson’s comeback attempt. His
brother, Taylor Griffin added 16 points for the Sooners and freshman stand-out Willie Warren set the nets on fire as
he scored 20.

Cats reach**Title:** Game of Winthrop * Tourney

**By:** John Morgan, Staff Writer

Coming off the signing of three players to the class of 2013, the women’s basketball team entered last weekend with
great enthusiasm. At the Winthrop tournament, the ’Cats capitalized on the energy, reaching the title game against stellar competition.

This year’s thrilling schedule, constructed by head coach Annette Watts, first brought the team to Rock Hill, SC, to face
the Winthrop Eagles. In a game that featured both first-half sluggishness and second-half scoring bursts, the ’Cats showcased their depth,
tenacity, and ability to maintain a lead. At the end of the first half, Davidson held only a 22-19 advantage
over the Eagles as both teams failed to hit a quarter of their shots from the floor. But as the
second half opened, the ’Cats came out on an 8-0 run, and from there, refused to look back. Winthrop managed
to cut the lead to single digits on a few occasions, but each time, the visitors renewed their offense in
the hostile environment.

Led by Mercedes Robinson’s ’09 double-double in scoring and rebounds, Davidson maintained complete control of the half, stretching its lead
to a decisive 25 with six minutes left. The successive 8-0, 9-0, and 10-0 runs put the final nail in
the Eagles’ coffin. Many accolades must be directed to the Wildcat bench, which outscored Winthrop’s 20-5 in the second half.
The final score was 61-40 in favor of Davidson.

Following Friday’s victory, the ’Cats were pitted against the Ole Miss Rebels of the SEC, one of the premier conferences
in women’s basketball. Davidson got off to a quick lead in this contest, etching out an eight-point advantage halfway through
the first half. Mississippi grabbed the lead with 2:40 remaining and entered the locker room up 26-23. As the second
half opened, things started to turn ugly for the Wildcats. With 10 minutes left, the Rebels took a nine-point lead,
and as the clock struck four, opened it up to 13. But the ’Cats weren’t finished, especially Robinson, who earned
another double-double as she knocked down 10 points in the final minutes. A pair of near misses at the end
of the game was all that separated Davidson from the tournament championship. The final score was 55-50 as Ole Miss
came out on top.

While a trophy from Winthrop would’ve been ideal, the ’Cats still boasted several strong individual performances, along with encouraging signs
from the team effort. Robinson and Alex Thompson ’10 were both named to the all-tournament team. Robinson, the SoCon preseason
player of the year, totaled 32 points and 25 rebounds over the two-game spread. Thompson scored 16 points and recorded
seven assists during the weekend, playing all 40 minutes of the title game.

As head coach Annette Watts predicted last week, the team faced no shortage of leadership over the weekend. In the
face of tough competition and pressure, a total of nine Wildcat players scored in the games. Play off the bench
sealed the deal against Winthrop and kept the game tight against Ole Miss.
