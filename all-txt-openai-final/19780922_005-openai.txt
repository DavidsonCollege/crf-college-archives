Zimmermann’s proposed Code on Faculty Evaluation

Responsibility for the initiation and conduct of evaluation rests with the President. In his discharge of this responsibility, he will normally delegate to the VPAA the work of conferring with department chairmen and colleagues and gathering data. Because of the need for maintaining close and harmonious rapport within the structures of a small college community, the evaluation process must involve confidentiality. Letters of evaluation from chairmen and colleagues will be held in confidence between the President and the VPAA. Student evaluations will be shared by the President and the VPAA only with the instructor.

During the visit, it will be the responsibility of the chairman and the VPAA, as well as the President, to explore further the relationship between the candidate's religious position and personal and career aspirations and the College’s objectives as set forth in the Statement of Purpose and this code of faculty evaluation procedures. The candidate will be interviewed by members of the appropriate department or departments as well as by the department chairman, the VPAA, and the President with a view to determining his or her professional competence, strength of commitment to teaching, and prospects for making a successful contribution to the work of the College through stimulating teaching, intellectual leadership, and fruitful personal relationships with students and colleagues.

Candidates may be invited during their visit to the campus to make a public presentation in their field or to teach a class. However, too much must not rest on a single performance. In the case of candidates without prior teaching experience, general promise, and in the case of experienced teachers, long-term performance in prior positions must be the principal basis for judgment. After the chairman has solicited the opinion of members of the department and received the opinion of other interested faculty members, he will discuss the candidates with the VPAA. The VPAA will communicate his judgments, along with the supporting information, to the President, who will make the final recommendation to the Trustees. If at all possible, the chairman will seek to interview as many potential candidates as possible at an appropriate professional meeting or other occasion. He will then review with the VPAA the dozen or so most promising candidates with a view to choosing the most likely ones for campus interviews. The VPAA will invite the leading candidate or candidates to the College for a visit. Along with an invitation, candidates for a position will receive a copy of the college’s Statement of Purpose.

The chairman may be asked to meet with the President and the VPAA before the President reaches his decision. Letters of appointment will emanate from the President’s Office. The letter of appointment will set forth the terms and conditions of appointment in accordance with the College Constitution, Article IV, Section 5, of the Trustee By-Laws, and this code of faculty evaluation procedures. Copies of all these documents shall be furnished to the candidate along with the letter of appointment, a copy of which, signed by the candidate, shall constitute a contract.

### Rules for New Faculty Members

#### Members of the Faculty on One-Year Probationary Appointments

Provided by the Constitution, Article X, Section C, a faculty member on an initial probationary appointment will be informed by March 1st of the decision as to whether the College’s standards and expectations have been met. During the new faculty member’s first year at the College, the VPAA will meet with him or her to explain further the evaluation procedures and to discuss the College’s standards and expectations. At the convenience of both parties, and when the instructor feels reasonably established in his or her teaching at Davidson, the VPAA will ordinarily arrange to attend one or more of the instructor’s classes. As much as for evaluation, the purpose of these visits is to help the instructor with the process of adjustment to Davidson and to assist in the attainment of his or her maximum potential as a teacher. The department chairman may likewise visit the new appointee’s classes for the same purpose.

During the fall term of the second year, the VPAA will meet with the department chairman to discuss the performance of the instructor. Letters will be solicited by the VPAA from colleagues who have come to know the new member through such means as committee assignments, and from members of the staff of courses and programs in which the instructor has participated. The instructor will be informed of the timing of the review and given the opportunity to submit such material as he or she believes will be helpful to a consideration of his or her performance. After studying this evidence and conducting further interviews if deemed necessary, the VPAA will review the instructor’s performance with the President. By December 15 of the second year, the instructor will be informed of the decision.receive from the President a letter either renewing the contract or communicating a decision not to renew it. The criteria for evaluation shall be those described in Section II. In applying them, the President and the VPAA will normally be looking for evidence of recent and potential growth in teaching ability, particularly in the case of instructors who are just beginning their teaching careers and who lack teaching experience. In making their decision, the President and the VPAA will weigh the prospects for growth against the greater mobility which faculty members enjoy in their early years of teaching, keeping in mind the fact that where prospects for tenure are slim, an early separation may be more to an instructor's advantage than renewal of contract.

After communication of the President's decision, the VPAA will be available to the instructor to discuss, insofar as confidential, the candidate will be advised of strengths and weaknesses in the instructor’s performance to date. The salary of a faculty member on contract is reviewed in conjunction with the decision of whether or not the contract will be renewed. The review preceding such decisions will be conducted during winter term. Visiting appointments, one-year terminal appointments, or part-time appointments are not considered probationary and do not require notification of termination. In the case of such appointments, a review would be conducted only at the President’s discretion.

VI: FACULTY MEMBERS ON SUBSEQUENT TERM APPOINTMENTS

As with members of the faculty in their first contract period, review will take place in the fall of the second year of the contract, and by December 15th the instructor will either be informed of the termination of his or her contract or offered a renewal. As stipulated by the College Constitution, in the event of termination at this point, the instructor will be entitled to a terminal year. In reaching their decision, the President and the VPAA will pay particular attention to evidence of growth since the last review. Normally, with each successive review, the expectation regarding performance will be increased, as the instructor gains experience as a teacher and scholar.

VII: THE TENURE DECISION

The decision to grant continuous tenure must be made only after a searching examination and with the greatest care, since usually it will represent a lifetime commitment. Continuous tenure entails not only an increased responsibility of the institution to the faculty member, but an increased responsibility of the faculty member toward the institution and its long-term welfare. At the point of the tenure decision, the evidence gathered should demonstrate convincingly that the candidate holds promise of making a continued contribution of the highest quality to the intellectual and moral life of the institution. If at this point any serious doubts remain regarding the prospects for long-term high performance, the institution, in order to carry out its responsibility to its students, must render a negative decision.

Preliminary to the tenure decision, there will be a review of the faculty member’s whole career at the College. As stated in Article X of the College Constitution, conferral of tenure by the Trustees requires not only evidence of demonstrated professional competence but of service to the academic community and commitment to the welfare of the College. The tenure evaluation will be made during the sixth year of full-time teaching at the College. Credit of up to three years will be given for full-time teaching at the assistant professor level or higher at an accredited four-year institution.

The review preceding the tenure decision is normally conducted by the VPAA on behalf of the President. It begins with an interview between the candidate and the VPAA during which the latter further explains the process, including the schedule to be followed. Either at this point or subsequently, the candidate will submit an updated curriculum vitae and all such materials as may be deemed helpful to a favorable consideration. The VPAA will usually arrange interviews between the candidate and the Education Committee of the Board of Trustees. He will also request of the candidate’s department chairman a full written evaluation according to the criteria set forth in Section II. In preparing his report, the chairman will consider all relevant evidence, including course syllabi, tests, grades awarded, research in progress, publications, professional meetings attended, papers presented, cooperation in the development of library holdings, the records of former students, and the contributions the candidate has made to their development.

In addition to requesting a report from the chairman, the VPAA will request written evaluations from members of the candidate’s department and may also request evaluations from members of the candidate’s division or other departments and divisions. He will review student evaluations, with particular attention to long-term trends. At his discretion, the VPAA may, in addition to letters, request interviews with persons who, in his estimation, are in a position to contribute to the evaluation process. The information and judgments resulting from all of the foregoing procedures will be shared with the President, whose recommendation will be communicated to the Trustees. The candidate will be informed of the Trustees’ decision prior to September 1st. In accordance with their decision, the ensuing academic year will constitute either the first year of continuous tenure or else a terminal year.

IX: EVALUATION OF TENURED MEMBERS OF THE FACULTY

The standards for evaluation of tenured members of the faculty will be the same as those used in making the tenure decision itself, namely, evidence of continued superior teaching performance and of sustained personal impact on the life of the institution. The President's recommendations regarding salary increases
