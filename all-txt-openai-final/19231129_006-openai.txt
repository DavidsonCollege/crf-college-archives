6; THE DAVIDSONIAN, NOVEMBER 29, 1923

Davidson Loves Fair Play

Wildcats Are Never Licked

DeARMON, Fullback
Davidson

Doc is a wonderful defensive player. A bad knee has kept him out of the game part of the year,
but he plays against the Blue Devils.

COX, Center
Davidson

Warren is the lightest man in the line. He is known especially for his fighting spirit which never gives up.

The Cats That Monk Younger Made Wild

HUNT, Halfback
Davidson

Popsy’s toe brought home the bacon at P. C. and scored against the Tar Heels. He has one more year
as a Wildcat.

SHEPHERD, Halfback
Davidson

Gig’s football career closes today. He will always be remembered for his dash across Carolina’s goal line in 1920 which
places him high in the Wildcat Hall of Fame.

CAPTAIN FAISON, End
Davidson

Lias, the Wildcat leader, completes his fourth year as varsity end. No captain has ever been more popular, a harder
worker, or a better player than Faison. Today he says goodbye to the moleskins. His place will be the hardest
on the team to fill next season.

FIELDS, Center
Davidson

Mason finishes his career today. For three years he has been on the line of scrimmage and his smile will
be missed next season.

LAIRD, Tackle
Davidson

Flake Laird was out of the Carolina game on account of a sprained shoulder but he will be in the
Trinity game to help bolster up their Red line.

MALLORY, Center
Davidson

Dan broke his leg in scrimmage just before the Wake Forest game. This knocked him out for the season. Dan
performed on end last season but works just as well at center.

CAPTAIN LEE, End
Citadel

Lee did not start against the Wildcats but entered the game for a few minutes. Weighing only 140 pounds, he
makes up in grit what he lacks in weight.

O'SHAUGHNESSY, Halfback
Citadel

This line-smashing back was the Citadel’s chief ground gainer against the Younger machine. He drove through the line for Citadel’s
largest gains.
