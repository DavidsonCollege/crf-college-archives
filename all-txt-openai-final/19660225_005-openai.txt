Tourney - Troubled Cats Try Again

BILL BRIGGS
Sports Editor

A DIFFERENT STORY?

“Psychologically we're in better shape than ever before—whatever that’s worth.” Coach Lefty Driesell reflected Tuesday before the tournament began. “Being in good psychological condition may not win a tournament, but it sure helps.”

Yesterday afternoon, helped or not by their psychological condition, a cool but scrappy Wildcat basketball team completely wiped the floor of Charlotte’s domed coliseum with the nauseating robin's-egg blue uniforms of The Citadel.

THE DAVIDSONIAN

For the third straight year the Southern Conference Tournament is being held in Charlotte. For the third straight year Davidson, led by the top player in the Southern Conference, is the pre-tourney favorite. For two straight years Davidson has lost in the semi-finals... will this be the third?

There are some differences this year. Most notably Driesell has lugged his chargers into Charlotte to spend the three-day tournament in the Coliseum Motor Court, away from books, classes, and loud dormitories.

“The best we've ever done in the tournament was three years ago in Richmond,” Driesell reminisced. “The tournament was sort of a break for the boys. For the past two years we've been coming back to classes, that might have affected our play.”

For the first time in three years Driesell is unranked nationally, but he looks upon this with a near “Pollyanna-ish” philosophy, “We won't have the pressure of being in the top ten this year. We won't be overconfident.”

All this helps to add up to the third big difference between this and the past two years — what Driesell meant by better psychological shape. Besides the pleasant atmosphere of a Charlotte motel and lack of pressure that national ranking gives, Driesell lists one other factor in his pre-tournament optimism.

“These sophomores this year have heard about the other good players we’ve had who didn’t win the tournament. This should give this year’s boys incentive to try to do something that Hetzel, Davidson, Teague and those boys couldn’t do.”

MAYBE THIS YEAR

This could be the year for Driesell to lead Davidson’s cagers over the visible foes that must haunt him — Richmond, West Virginia, William and Mary. But just as vital, if the 'Cats are to take home the trophy, we must beat an invisible enemy. We must somehow conquer ourselves or again we will find our post-tournament solace by tears and curses. I have grown tired of this reward.

We must—as a team—conquer our fear to show spirit, to shake with eager anticipation as the Coliseum’s spotlight underlines the opening introductions, to jump off the bench or scream praise from the floor at a good play and to rip down victory nets. But to conquer ourselves as a team we must also conquer ourselves as students. For at least two more tournament games, I hope, we must drop our shallow facade of coolness. We must learn to drink deeply of the wine of victory if we ever hope to really taste it.

So we must shout ourselves hoarse, show spirit enough to let a small group of players know we have given ourselves to them, so they will give themselves in turn to us.

PAGE FIVE

We must return to a past day, before Davidson, where it was no crime to show emotions and no damning fingers pointed at the joy you took with winning. We must recapture what we have lost or we will again need to worry about the unfairness of our scapegoat, the tournament. We will again be REGULAR SEASON champions. We must recapture what we have lost, so late tomorrow night we can pour onto the floor to carry players to the nets—not sneak under the stands to spit at imaginary villains.

Wildcats Clobber Citadel

Davidson's Wildcats finished out the regular season with a 77-64 conference victory against The Citadel last Friday on the Charleston hardwoods. Captain Dick Snyder led the ‘Cats by scoring 26 points. The game was hard-fought, but late in the second half, trailing by several points, the Bulldogs went into a full court press. The fast-moving ‘Cats were then able to add to the lead by several consecutive fast breaks.

After the game Coach Lefty Driesell had this to say: “The boys played well tonight and we're ready for the tournament. I am very pleased with the play of the team and this year we will win the conference tourney as well as the regular season.”

Davidson finished the season with a 17-5 overall record, 11-1 in the conference.

A RARE SIGHT YESTERDAY AFTERNOON

Starters Watch Subs Finish Off Citadel’s Season

Mighty Kittens End Year

Davidson’s high-flying, quick-shooting freshman cagers squeaked by the Citadel, 73-72, last Saturday and thus finished one of the most successful freshman seasons in the school's history. In their final encounter, the ‘Kittens had to fight their way back from a 39-35 halftime deficit. Wayne Huckel led Davidson scoring with 17 points; the game high was 26 by the soldiers’ Ed Zimsky.

On the season, the Wildkittens were led in scoring by Huckel, a 6-1½ guard from Cranford, N. J. The chunky 200-pounder, though probably the poorest outside shooter on the starting unit, led his mates in field goal accuracy with 49.8 percent. Huckel made up for his outside misses with a collection of twisting, off-balance layups, uncanny driving hook shots, and tip-ins. His under-the-basket acrobatics and steals drew numerous foul shots, which he converted at a 76.2 percent rate.

Huckel’s running-mate at guard was six-foot speedster David Moser from Fort Wayne, Ind. Moser, the most naturally talented pointman to ever don a Davidson uniform, was a constant threat from as far away as 30 feet with his deadly jump shot. A fantastic dribbler and accurate passer, Moser piled up a team-high 32 assists.

TOTALS: 16 | 1250 | 556 | 44.5 | 404 | 287 | 71.0 | 722 | 1399 | 87.5On the way to a 16.2 average, the team's leading rebounder was Mike Spann, an All-Stater from Burlington, who pulled down 133 rebounds for an 8.31 average. Spann, a non-scholarship player, was omnipresent on the court—pulling down rebounds, leading fast breaks, and firing in shots from both inside and out. Mike O'Neill, from Valparaiso, Ind., played the other wing. O'Neill hit a whopping 86.4 percent from the foul line to lead the team in that category. Though he excelled under the boards, the 6-5 Hoosier’s best shot was a booming long-range, low-trajectory jump shot of the Jeff Mullins type. Starting center for the team was Rocky Crosswhite of Bethesda, Md. Though short on weight, Crosswhite had a fine outside set shot and was a good ball handler. He was ably assisted at the pivot spot by 6-7 Mike Dickens of Newport News, Va. Jumping jack Tony Orsbon provided valuable reserve strength at forward, and Chris Wood and Al Pearson added depth in the backcourt.

Freshman Status Clarified By New IMAC Proposal

The IMAC has proposed several changes in freshman intramural participation channels to eliminate the confusion caused by previous non-action. The recommended action will take place immediately upon the completion of the IMAC basketball schedule. The main point in the IMAC proposal is that freshmen be allowed to participate in the intramural program as fraternity members. The proposal further states that the freshman league is to be eliminated and that a single freshman team be organized to replace it. This team would consist entirely of non-pledges.

Further, the IMAC has dissolved the concept of inter-dorm play and has slated that a freshman is to be elected to represent the non-pledged team in the IMAC (only non-pledges would be allowed to run or vote). Tommy Hunter, president of the IMAC, and David Townsend, secretary, presented this recommendation to the Faculty Committee on Fraternities, Clubs, and Social Life. The committee adopted this motion last week as proposed to them with the restriction that it apply only to the coming season, the spring semester, 1966, and that a new proposal be made for next year.

In recent action, one of the big games of the year was the stunning upset victory by the SAE's over the invincible Kappa Sigs. One unnamed Sig remarked, "It'll never happen again in a million years." In other games, the Phi Gams dropped a close one to the Machis. In other action, the Sigma Nus were outplayed by the E's, who in turn fell to the ATO's. The Phi Delts took the Indies over the top, and the Betas and KA's both beat the Pikas, who settled for a forfeit win over the Sig Eps.

‘Cats Oust Bulldogs, 79-61, Face Hot Spiders Tonight

By CLIFF DUKE

Davidson hurdled the first obstacle to its quest for the elusive Southern Conference crown by submerging The Citadel in a flood of second-half points yesterday afternoon, 79-61. By the game’s end, everyone joined in the fun, but not before the Bulldogs’ deliberate style had the patrons squirming in their seats. The final score belies the closeness of the contest in its opening stages, when both teams were as chilly in the first half as the weather outside. Over two minutes had slipped away when Bobby Lane popped from the outside and relieved any worry about a scoreless duel. In the midst of sporadic scoring by the Bulldogs, Dick Snyder reeled off eight points to send the Wildcats out in front. However, both teams seemed to agree to give the official scorer a breather because they spent the rest of the half adjusting their sights. As the half drew to a close, the crowd wondered if the ‘Cats were going to be wrapped up in the cocoon spun by the slow-moving Bulldogs, but Davidson broke gait and sprinted to seven straight points and a 29-19 margin at intermission. The Citadel had been badly hampered by 27 percent shooting.

The second half revealed a complete reversal of form. Unable to maintain their control game, the Bulldogs joined in the fast-breaking game but came out second best. Brilliant shooting by Snyder and Lane marshaled the torrent of points to the final 18-point spread. At one stage, the margin reached the 26-point level but subsided as Coach Lefty Driesell allotted ample playing time to the reserves.

This year, for the third season in a row, Davidson entered the tournament as the number one team, but in the previous two seasons, the unfortunate ‘Cats saw their national aspirations ground into the dust of defeat. The athletes who placed Davidson on the big-time map graduated, and the current crop of youngsters were given little chance to achieve the same renown. However, led in every phase by the superb Dick Snyder, these sophomores and Phil Squier, a senior starting for the first time, fashioned a 17-5 regular season log. They had matured enough during the season for Driesell to step out of character early in the week and admit publicly that they had a fine shot at the tournament crown.

But in the Southern Conference, as in only one other conference in the nation, season records are tossed out the window and eight teams indulge in a three-day backstroke brawl. It is from this family squabble that Davidson has yet to emerge as “king of the mountain.” This is where their hearts have been broken, and this is where a new band rises to make amends. To do so, the ‘Cats must face two more foes. Tonight, Richmond pits the charm of fourth seed against Driesell's legions, hoping to earn their own way into the final night's action. For the past two years, the fourth-seeded team has copped the title after whipping the ‘Cats in the semifinals.

In yesterday's action, the Spiders nipped ECC on a shot by Tom Green with :03 left in the contest. In qualifying for the semi-finals, Richmond scorched the Coliseum cords for a tournament record 65.6 percent. A pair of guards, Spike Welsh and All-Conference Johnny Moates, will team with Green to contest tonight’s issue. Should Davidson vault into the finals, they will meet either West Virginia or William and Mary, who square off against each other in tonight's other clash. West Virginia displayed a deadly eye in prevailing over VMI's comeback effort, and William and Mary whipped Furman’s Paladins in last night’s preliminaries.
