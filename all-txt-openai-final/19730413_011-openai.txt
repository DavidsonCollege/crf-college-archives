Rain, snow, wind, and cold weather may not slow the mail, but it seemed to bog down the Davidson track
team in their triangular meet at Appalachian against VMI and Appalachian last Saturday.

The Cats placed last with 46 points in the rain and cold. The Apps won with 94 points and VMI
amassed 54. In Tuesday's dual meet at VMI, Davidson was drubbed by the Keydets 98-64, as the cold weather was
again a factor.

One of the few bright spots in these two meets was New Yorker Mark Connors. In the triangular meet, Connors
won both the 100 and 220, and also ran on the winning mile relay team. Tuesday at VMI, he won
the 220 and placed second in the 100 with a wind-aided 9.6.

Other winners in the triangular meet were David Crumpler in the discus and Dave Peaco in the high hurdles. Davidson
continued to do well in the high jump as Eppa Rixey and Tim Rogers placed second and third respectively. Paul
Caldwell and Jeff Diller both came in second in their events, the long jump and the shot put. Despite placing
fourth in the steeplechase, Steve Scroggs established a new Davidson record.

Other than Connors, Davidson runners were not as successful. Ricky Bell, however, did well in the high jump as they
swept all three places. The jumpers were led by Rixey and Rogers who tied for first. Dave Peaco finished the
sweep by placing third.

The high jump was not the only field event in which the Cats did well. Davidson also had firsts in
the long jump, shot put, triple jump, pole vault, and discus. Caldwell won the long jump while Tom Case placed
third. Case was also successful in the triple jump where he took first. Steve Shankweiler won the shot put as
Diller came in third. Diller also placed third in the hammer throw where he broke his own school record. Allen
Schaberg defeated number one discus man Crumpler as Davidson took first and second. Woody Van Meter tied for first as
he and the VMI pole vaulter decided it was too cold to go on.
