Thinclads still breaking records

By Jean DeMoss

The Davidson women thinclads opened the outdoor track season Saturday at the Seahawk Invitational at UNC-Wilmington. Competing first for the
Wildcats was Lara Burkholder in the long jump. Despite the less than perfect conditions, Burkholder finished first and set a
new school record.

In other events, Maria Whitehead finished sixth place in the triple jump with a mark of 34’1¾".

Setting the standards for the distance runners, sophomore Marie Grisez paced herself to a 4:59 1500m. Phuong Nguyen won the
next heat in a stunning 4:57, a personal best.

Davidson’s pack of 800m runners consisted of Sallie Permar, Karen Marshall, and Annie Parsons. Permar ran a personal best of
2:30. Marshall, in her first race since knee surgery, ran an impressive 2:35, while Parsons ran a 2:43.

For the field events, sophomore Erika Gromelski threw the discus 87’5" which earned her a fourth place finish. The last
event of the day was the 4X400m relay.

The team of Lara Burkholder (63), Sallie Permar (67), Marie Grisez (65), and Phuong Nguyen (66) chased the school record.

The Wildcats are far ahead of their '93 performances. With the addition of a talented freshmen class, the thinclads are
in quick pursuit of breaking many school records.

Sailing team takes 1st at home regatta

By Andrew Cole

The Davidson sailing team won the second regatta of the spring on Lake Norman last Saturday, moving it into first
place ahead of College of Charleston in the North Points division of the South Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Association.

The morning started out with a light but sailable breeze and Davidson came out quick in the first five races,
posting four firsts and a second. The wind did not hold, however, and the last three races were sailed in
a virtual vacuum with less than perfect finishes for the team. Fortunately, the earlier scores were good enough to keep
Davidson in first place throughout the entire regatta. Six other teams came to compete, including College of Charleston, The Citadel,
Clemson, University of South Carolina, NC State, and the Savannah College of Art and Design. The team is now preparing
for the final North Points regatta of the spring. If it can stay in the top four teams in the
North, it will go to University of Florida on April 10 to compete in the District Championship, from which the
top two go to the Intercollegiate National Championship in May.

Sailing for Davidson this weekend were junior Dave Saudek, sophomores Frances Bailey, Morgan Perry, and Andrew Cole, and freshmen Ian
Fitzpatrick and Heather Radden.

World Cup exhibition

Soccer continued from page 1

$16.50 ticket for the game at Davidson is a bargain. Official World Cup merchandise will be sold, and all three
practices will be open to the public.

The only other possibility for an exhibition match in the area this spring might be in Richmond, Virginia, but no
plans have been made. The closest site for actual World Cup competition will be in Orlando, Florida.

Davidson College has received an honor by being chosen to host this event. The event gives the college and community
an opportunity to display national pride by supporting the squad that will represent America this summer. Tickets will be available
to the public at 9:00 a.m., on Wednesday, March 26, and information can be reached at 704-892-3275 or 1-800-768-CATS.
