Personnel cutbacks facilitate cost-cutting efforts

In an effort to balance the budget for the 1998-99 school year and pointing to “fiscal realities,” President Bobby Vagt eliminated or halved “less than half a dozen” jobs at the College in the past two weeks.

Vagt declined to mention names, but Lt. David McLaurin and Ray Liguori of the campus police department were fired, while some administrative assistants — including Ruth Ann Swart of the Center for Interdisciplinary Studies and Ann Callahan of the Physics Department — were demoted from full-time to part-time.

There are also some positions currently open that will not be filled. According to Dean of Students Tom Shandley, occupations in academic departments, the Athletic Department, and Student Health Services were affected.

Overall, according to Shandley, over half a million dollars worth of cuts were made.

“We're going to do more with less,” Vagt said in his office last week, “so we can go forward in what I call managed growth.”

Vagt stressed that the recent personnel changes were not the beginning of a massive series of layoffs.

There are still some holes in the budgets for 1999-2000 and 2000-2001, but those will reportedly be filled “on the revenue side.”

“As far as we can see now, we have done what we think needed to be done,” said the businessman-turned-college-president. “This is not the first of two shoes.”

Of the $46-million-dollar budget set for 1998-99, $27 million will be spent directly on people — nearly 60 percent of the College’s total expenditure.

“That verifies, quantitatively, how important people are,” Vagt said. “But it also means you’re not going to modify the budget without affecting people, and we’re going to do that carefully.”

Tuition and the number of students have steadily gone up in the last 20 to 25 years. In 1975, Vagt explained, 14 percent of the average household income was used to pay college bills. In 1995, that number had skyrocketed to 20 percent.

“That growth cannot continue,” he said. “To be the kind of community we say is important, arguably we are too far already, but we can’t go beyond where we are right now.”

In recent years, Davidson’s tuition has increased by as much as 13 percent annually. Thanks to some changes in the budget for the coming school year, including the personnel cutbacks, College administrators are expecting just a four percent rise next year — the lowest such number in 21 years.

“We looked at the budget and, quite honestly, ways we could lower the tuition increase for students,” Shandley said. “It got extremely hard to do that and not look at ways we could cut back.”

The budget modifications will also allow the school to continue its commitment to technology in the dorm room and classroom; provide expensive lab equipment in the soon-to-be-completed Life Sciences Building, which will have a $300,000-dollar operating expense; and facilitate the recruitment and on-campus experience of international students.

The College will also pay particular attention to methods of greater energy conservation; it will soon install new light fixtures in Chambers which will reduce lighting costs to 60 percent of the current level.

“There are some exciting things in the budget made possible by the kind of budget recisions we've made,” said Vagt, referring also to a three percent increase in the salary pool for 1998-99.

“Davidson’s not in dire shape,” Shandley said. “But with the student body staying constant and tuition not going up like it used to, there’s not new revenue coming into the College.”

“We're in a good vantage point right now, and we want to maintain that,” Vagt added. “We don’t have to cut back to the bone. It’s better to have a little hurt now than a big hurt later.”
