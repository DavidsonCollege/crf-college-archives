THE DAVIDSONIAN

Baker & Gibson Lead Men’s Track at App. State Open

By Keith Gordon

The men’s track team had their last “practice” meet before the 1999 Southern Conference Championships this past weekend, as fourteen
of its members traveled to Boone, NC for the Appalachian State Open. Competing with athletes from seven other schools, the
men performed exceptionally well yet again, despite the cool temperature and strong wind gusts.

Leading the way with undoubtedly the best races of the day were freshman star Dan Gibson and senior co-captain Stan
Baker. Gibson solidified his standing among the best runners in the league by taking first in the 800m Saturday in
a near-school record time of 1:54.87. His performance was only .14 seconds off the existing mark, and placed him in
prime position for an All-Conference selection in two events this weekend (including the 1500m, where he is currently ranked 7th).
Baker crushed his personal record (PR) en route to a 58.39 in the 400m hurdles, good enough for 4th place.
His race was a perfect example of the breakthrough season this Wildcat club has witnessed since the first indoor practice
in January.

Baker also led the team in the 200m, sprinting his way to a 23.64. Freshman Grant Bleecher continued his late-season
surge by running 23.74, while John Moore completed the Davidson trio with a time of 24.44. Michael Albert once again
led the men in the 400m, placing 5th and running his PR in that event (51.59).

The 800m saw Jay Jahnes lay even stronger claims to a spot among the conference’s top rookies as he put
in another solid race (1:57.6, 2nd place) despite an ankle injury suffered during the week leading up to the meet.
Jonathan Fly followed in 2:10.3, Steve Johnston ran another comeback race in 2:14.9, while freshman Miles Harmon finished behind “Snake”
in 2:17.6.

Brent Ferrell recorded another impressive effort in the 1500m (4:06.7, 5th place) as he gears up for the team’s second
two-event All-Conference attempt. Ferrell is ranked 3rd in the 3000m steeplechase and 2nd in the 5000m. Thomas McElveen closely followed
Ferrell in 4:10.9, while Paul Irwin and Keith Gordon ran 4:19.1 and 4:27.1, respectively.

The 4x100m relay team of Baker, Addam Marcotte, Albert, and Moore sprinted their way to a 45.37, with Moore gunning
down the UNC-Greensboro anchor leg in the process, giving the relay team a 4th place finish.

The 1999 installment of the SoCon Championships will be held April 23-24 at East Tennessee State in Johnson City, TN.
