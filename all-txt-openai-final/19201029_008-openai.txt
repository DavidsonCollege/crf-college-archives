ADVANCE DOPE ON CITADEL
Bulldogs Present Strong Line-up for Saturday’s Fray.

Davidson Wildcats meet The Citadel Cadets on Wearn Field in Charlotte next Saturday in a game that promises to be
full of strategy and hard fighting. Like the Wildcats, the Cadets have been meeting some of their hardest opponents early
in the season. V. M. I. walked off with their scalp to the tune of 35 and 0, and Furman
by a score of 21 to 6. This does not mean that our sailing Saturday will be easy, however, as
V. M. I. is putting out one of the South's best machines this year and Furman is playing stellar ball,
which facts help to account for Citadel's losses. The Cadets came back strong last Saturday and defeated Wofford, 19 to
0 in a game in which they assumed the offensive. Their line-up for Saturday will probably be Lee, R. E.;
Grambling, R. T.; Heinsohn, L. T.; Whittaker, L. E.; Jeter, R. T.; Marshall, Center; Eude, L. G.; Post, Q. B.;
Wulbert, R. H. B.; Kollock, L. H. B.; Jarvis, F. B.

Davidson, having a good start on the upward path due to her recent victories over Wake Forest and the University
of Richmond, is out for blood and new honors. Comparative scores fail us in this game as the two schedules
have not yet crossed. However, our chances seem to be about equal, due to the fact that Citadel plays under
S. I. A. A. rulings which will throw out for Davidson, Schenck, Poe, and Moore. The men who will probably
appear in the Red are N. Shepard, W. Shepherd, Massey, McFadden, and Dick.

Morning sky you, Getz! Who crossed, Weaver! Last game N. U. Sam end. 3 Aubries all and now won't buy
one for wars like K. U. fair and the best gotta.
