CAROLINA PLANS FOUR-MILE CROSS-COUNTRY RUN

The University of North Carolina has practically completed arrangements for a four-mile cross-country run to be held near Chapel Hill. They have asked all of the colleges of the state to take part in this event. Already A. & M. and Trinity have notified Manager Hackler of their willingness to participate. According to the agreement, each college can enter as many contestants as it desires. The decision will be based on the four finishing best for each college.

W. G. Morrison, captain of Davidson’s track team, received a letter from the Carolina manager requesting Davidson to enter, but as yet it has not been decided by the executive committee of the Athletic Association whether Davidson will be represented. The student body is very desirous of sending their four men and it is hoped that the answer to Carolina will be favorable. Wake Forest is considering the matter, and it is likely they will enter. The event is scheduled for November 20.

NEW BIBLE STUDY CLASSES

As a result of the recent meetings, about seventy-five new men have signed up for Bible study classes. In order to meet this demand, the following new classes have been organized: P. B. Price, 29 Rumple, Manhood of the Master; J. H. Carson, 29 Georgia, New Studies in Acts; G. L. Cooper, 75 N. W. Chambers, Student Standards of Action; A. M. McKeithen, 9 Rumple, Manhood of the Master; R. W. Morrison, 16 Georgia, Paul in Everyday Life; F. H. Smith, 20 Rumple, Student Standards of Action.

The following change in schedule of trains passing Davidson has been announced by the Southern Railway, through Mr. Andrews:

No. 15 (going South) at 8:03 p.m. instead of 7:47 p.m. (daily).
No. 24 (going North) at 7:03 p.m. instead of 8:13 p.m. (except Sunday). No. 24 will leave Charlotte at 6:10 p.m.

MR. BUSCHALL TO ADDRESS Y. M. C. A.

Mr. T. C. Buschall, Secretary of the Y. M. C. A. at the University of North Carolina, will address the Y. M. C. A. here Thursday night. His subject will be “The Morning Watch.” Mr. Buschall is an interesting and inspiring speaker. There will be special music by the orchestra. “Send the attendance curve up.”

CLUBS ORGANIZED

MEDICAL CLUB

At a meeting held in the chapel last Tuesday night, the Davidson Medical Club was formally organized, and the following officers elected: President, W. A. Dumas (by acclamation); vice-president, Wm. Hollister; secretary-treasurer, D. V. Hudson. About forty men were present at the meeting, enthusiastically endorsing the movement. Committees were appointed on name and constitution, and it is hoped that permanent organization may be effected within a few weeks.

A good proportion of the Davidson students, usually about 15 percent annually, are in preparation for the study of medicine; and through uniting themselves into a club of this type, these men hope to gain a better knowledge of the preparation needed for that study, of the entrance requirements of the various schools, and in addition, to secure speakers on subjects allied to medicine, whenever possible. All men who are expecting to make medicine a life work are urged to join the club. It was planned to have Dr. R. H. Crawford, a 1910 Davidson graduate, who after obtaining his...M.D. degree at Johns Hopkins University, spent a year in the German field hospitals, and who has just returned, to speak to the student body this week, if possible. A committee was appointed to arrange the details.

GEORGIA CLUB.
The Georgia Club held its initial meeting of the session last Wednesday morning after chapel, and plans were discussed for the year. The Empire State sent twenty-eight of her sons to Davidson this fall, and prospects are good for an enthusiastic club. It was suggested that J. G. Patton, Jr., be re-elected as president for 1915-16, but he declared against the second term policy, and W. A. Dumas was elected to succeed him. A social meeting with its accompanying “feed” will be held early in November, and the other officers will be elected at that time.
