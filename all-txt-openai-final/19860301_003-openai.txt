Internationally —

Sources in North Africa revealed last week that General Muammar Qaddafi of Libya has signed a secret military alliance with
President Reagan. Reagan reportedly agreed to end all hostilities between Libya and the United States and to transfer nuclear technology
from the U.S. to Libya. In return, Qaddafi has agreed to train C.I.A. technicians in appropriate uses of terrorist tactics
on airplanes, in airports, and on cruise ships in Europe and the Middle East.

General Idi Amin has arranged to return to Uganda after seven years of exile in Iraq. Declaring that he is
frustrated and tired of the civil war and military takeovers of the government in Kampala, Amin said, “I will return
peace, strength, and democracy to the Ugandan people.”

Meanwhile, claiming that “we loved President Nixon, gas-guzzlers, and the American consumer,” the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has
recently promised to reduce gas prices for the United States to pre-1973 levels. Exxon announced Tuesday that if all goes
well, the price of gasoline will drop to 35.9¢ per gallon within a year. Commenting on the future of automobile
production, Ford founder Henry Ford announced, “We’ve been waiting to market the Edsel for a long time, now, and this
seems to be our chance.”

Acknowledging the high intelligence quotient of President Ronald Reagan, Soviet Premier Mikhael Gorbachev announced Sunday his new Eastern Block Strategic
Defense Initiative (EBSDI). “I'd like to think we don’t need an anti-ballistic missile treaty either,” Gorbachev said. He promised that
his EBSDI would be researched and ready for production by 1992. “Hopefully, we can eradicate the necessity of nuclear weapons
on the planet Earth, reserving explosions for all to see in space.” He noted that his EBSDI will be able
to strike anything, be it Korean jetliners, space shuttles, or spy satellites, at the press of a button.

PLO leader Yassir Arafat has signed a new terrorism treaty with Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid, it was reported
Thursday. Arafat has offered free Palestinian freedom fighters for Mexican attacks on Houston and El Paso. In return, de la
Madrid agreed to send Mexican sombrero militants to aid in the PLO’s attacks on Spain. “I’ve decided to get back
at Spain and the United States once and for all, for all those years of mistreatment we faced,” de la
Madrid said.

Domestically —

North Carolina Senator Jesse Helms was caught red-handed last week attending the 1986 NAACP convention. When asked why he was

people loved me after all!”

Meanwhile, religious fundamentalist Jerry Falwell made a trip through the Appalachian mountains last week to determine if hunger really exists
in the United States. After touring the Biltmore House in Asheville, N.C., Falwell exclaimed, “There are no poor people around
here. With a guy like Vanderbilt here, Appalachia has been one of the richest areas of the whole country for
years!”

Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts has decided once again to run for the 1988 Democratic Presidential nomination. Saying, “I couldn’t
make up my mind, but now I believe every murderer is entitled to a second chance,” Kennedy has begun soliciting
contributions for his campaign from Right to Life coalitions across the country. Kennedy has also asked the E.F. Hutton company
and former Vice-President Spiro T. Agnew to run his campaign.

Kaddafi-Reagan pact, gas drops to 35.9¢

President Reagan recently promised Congress that the budget could be easily balanced within three weeks if it would “let me
have a stab at it.” Reagan has offered to reduce the budget by increasing military expenditures so that the Pentagon
can have enough money to covertly fund the C.I.A. in operations in several small countries in Central America and Southern
Africa. Reagan’s plan calls for an overthrow of the treasuries of Nicaragua, Angola, and Mozambique, and a covert airlift of
the finances of these treasuries into the United States for safekeeping.

Finally, Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger said the Defense Department will begin marketing new $600 toilet seat covers for sale
to the general public. Commenting on the new policy, Weinberger said, “We want to demonstrate to the public how well-designed
these toilet seat covers really are.” The Defense Department will use $400...price tag labels to market the toilet seats. Thought
for the Week — “I really didn't know what was going on.” — Ronald Wilson Reagan, on the deployment of
approximately 250 marine forces in Lebanon, who were subsequently murdered by terrorists.

PTL purchases Davidson campus
By L. RON HUBBARD

The PTL club, a Charlotte-based religious resort organization, has decided to purchase the Davidson campus for use as a vacation
spot. The Rev. Jim Bakker, president of PTL, said, “We figured that we'd put a little 500-room hotel in front
of that Chambers building, run a monorail out to Main Street, and turn the DCPC into a new sound stage.”
Bakker also mentioned plans to turn Belk dorm into “a second crystal palace.”

PTL’s takeover shouldn’t hurt Davidson academic life, though, said Davidson Dean of Students Will Terry. “Student life should actually improve,”
said Terry, “because tuition will be free. Anybody who makes a small donation — say, $25,000 — will be able
to attend. That shouldn’t be any problem for, well, the Hods, for example.”

Bakker said that there will be a few changes in area course requirements for Davidson students. “We’ll require courses in
Bible, Jesus, God, The Good Book, Christ, The Prince of Peace, and all that sort of stuff,” he said. “We'll
also encourage a big emphasis on creative financing and television production. Tammy Fay will offer a makeup application course.”

Bakker said that further changes in the curriculum will include courses on interior decorating, direct mail, and the works of
Billy Graham and Oral Roberts. Bakker will also work with the college administration to reorganize the faculty and staff. “We've
got to get rid of that guy — what’s his name, Ratliff,” Bakker whispered. “I’ve heard he’s serious about foreign
aid. We can’t have that. We look at foreign missions like, well, like Burger King looks at Herb.”

He mentioned future plans for a “Patterson Amusement Court” to include a Praise God ferris wheel, a St. Paul roller
coaster, University of Swimming Pool Management, and a Jesus Christ ‘Walk on Water’ slide. “Anybody who makes a small donation
— say, $50 — will be able to ride on all the rides. There won’t be any exclusion; you'll still
be able to self-select into whichever ride you want,” Bakker said.

Tammy Fay Bakker, Jim Bakker’s wife, said that the Bakker family houseboat will be berthed on Lake Norman as a
temporary home for the Bakker family. “We've given all our savings to PTL, and we can’t afford a hotel room
when we come up here to do the show,” she said. “We donated the Lincoln, the Mercedes, the Corvette, and
Tammy Sue didn’t get the plush seats in her Jaguar — but I just had to keep my chinchilla coat.
It’s hard to stay warm when you’re on a diet.” She added, “It’s difficult to do the Lord’s work when
you don't have a place to get made up.”

The PTL takeover should provide some welcome changes in the Davidson cultural life. Tammy said, “Pat Boone, Slim Whitman, and
Jim Nabors are all going to give concerts in the re-named ‘His Love’ Auditorium next year. We'll also get Oral
and Richard Roberts to take part in the lecture series. We think everybody'll love it, especially since there was such
support for Michael W. Smith last year.” Tammy added, “We'll also start a new weight-reduction support group. And we'll get
rid of that Women’s Concern Committee. They're so icky.”

Jim Bakker outlined plans to open a number of new shops on Main Street. “We'll have a crystal shop, a
travel agency, and a tanning salon,” said Bakker. “Of course, we'll keep most of the old shops. Like Norton. Tammy's
been getting her hair done at Norton’s for years, and we both think his hairstyles really improve her on-camera personality.”
