“The Barber of Seville”

Wonderful Week for Music

As the end of the term draws near, the weeks seem to get busier than the weekends. This week is
no exception, but hopefully, there will be enough time for you to take advantage of some of the non-study activities
to ease your mind.

Two music-oriented acts will be featured this week. The first is “The Barber of Seville,” presented by the New York
City Opera Theatre, as the first Artist Series performance of the year on October 31.

The New York City Opera Theatre is a touring group, founded in 1944 to bring opera to students.

Its version of “The Barber of Seville” is in English and promises to be quite amusing. (And hopefully quite popular—William
Brown proudly announced that all but 50 seats in Love Auditorium have been sold for the series.)

Second on the musical agenda is the folk duo of Meisburg and Walters. They will perform at the Tuesday night
worship service (which, incidentally, will be held in the 900 Room this week) and possibly in the 900 Room after
the Opera.

They will also play on Wednesday and Thursday in the 900 Room at 9:30 and 11:00. They are well worth
taking a study break for!

Parents, Pumpkins, and More

Meisburg and Walters will perform on campus Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. Take a break and hear some good folk music.

I refuse to print the entire schedule for Parents’ Weekend. It’s in the announcement sheet, on posters, and in brochures.
But I will mention a few of the more interesting and pertinent events and also a few changes that have
been made.

The main item of general interest on Friday is the 9:00 performance of Windfall in the 900 Room. Windfall is
a student group and they will also perform Saturday night.

For those whose parents are coming, the President’s Picnic Lunch on Saturday has been moved to Richardson Plaza (in front
of the library) and it will feature entertainment by the Jazz Band and 1894.

Other changes: the matinee performance of “The Miser” has been moved to 2:30, and the basketball scrimmage will be in
Charlotte at 5:00.

That’s it for Parents’ Weekend—now for the week’s other noteworthy event, namely Halloween.

“Return of the Vampire” will be shown in Belk Quad at 12:30 Saturday night/Sunday morning to kick off the freaky
festivities. Nothing spooky happens on Sunday, but Monday brings several Halloween-oriented events.

At 8:00 pm on WBTV, the classic “It’s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown” will be shown, hopefully on the big
screen. Also at 8:00 that night, ETC sponsors a costume dance, with music by “The Dynamic Upsetters.” Beer too, of
course. At 10:00 there will be a Halloween poetry reading in the 900 Room.

Last and definitely least, we come to the big day itself: October 31st. In typical Davidson tradition, there are (as
of press time) no Halloween activities taking place on Halloween. Maybe next year!
