The DAVIDSONIAN. September 15, 1915

FRESH-SOPH GAME.

The annual Fresh-Soph. baseball game was played on the Sprunt Athletic Field Monday morning, September 6. The Sophs won in
a very slow game by the score of 6 to 2. In the first frame, it looked pretty dark for
the Sophs when, after a series of hits, the Fresh put two runs across the plate. This good luck, however,
did not last very long. When the Sophs saw that the Fresh really meant business, they tightened up, and the
Freshmen were unable to put another run across. The Sophs began to warm up in the second inning and proceeded
to rap on Currie during the remainder of the game for seven hits. The Fresh scored only three hits, two
of which came in the first inning. The Fresh played very good ball for men who were new to each
other, having never practiced together before the game. The line-up was as follows:

Dean, Harwood, 3b Woods, ss

NEW MEMBER OF FACULTY TAKES UP DUTIES

Prof. W. W. Woods, who is the latest addition to the Davidson faculty, comes to us highly recommended by the
authorities at the University of Virginia, where he took his Bachelor's and Civil Engineering degrees. While there, he was a
member of the Phi Beta Kappa honorary fraternity and one of the leaders of his class. For the last three
years, he has been in active engineering work with the DuPont Powder Company, but gave up his position with them
to take up special work at the University of Virginia during the past summer, preparatory to his coming to Davidson.
As a member of the Davidson faculty, he will teach Mathematics, Geology, and Astronomy. The people of Davidson welcome Professor
Woods to his new position, and he enters upon his duties with the best wishes of the entire student body.

CLASS OFFICERS ELECTED.

The meetings of the various classes, held the first of last week, resulted in the election of the following officers:

Seniors—President, F. H. Smith; Vice-President, T. R. McNeill; Secretary and Treasurer, H. McCormick; Historian, J. G. Patton; Poet, J. L.
Payne; Student Council Member, T. R. McNeill.

Juniors—President, S. T. Henderson; Vice-President, J. C. Paisley; Secretary and Treasurer, D. I. McKeithan; Historian, E. G. Hampton.

Sophomores—President, W. D. Lawson; Vice-President, J. M. Black; Secretary and Treasurer, S. R. Fowle; Historian, L. A. Chambliss.

As provided by the constitution, the Freshmen will elect officers after December 1. It is provided that meetings before that
time shall be called by the President of the Student Body.

At a meeting of the Athletic Association Friday morning, the 10th, after chapel, T. M. Hill was elected manager of
the basketball team. Hill and Edgerton were recommended by the executive committee, Hill being elected.

MATRICULATION FIGURES.

Up to date, the register shows that 342 students have matriculated. It is practically certain that the number will reach
350 within the next few days. The student body is composed of men gathered from all over the South, representing
ten states and three foreign countries. It is a significant fact that Davidson has more students from other states than
any college in North Carolina. South Carolina furnishes 62, Georgia 27, Virginia 15, Mississippi 13, Alabama 1, Arkansas 7, Tennessee
13, Texas 3, and North Carolina 185. Of these, 57 have chosen the ministry as a profession, 57 medicine, 24
law, 7 teaching, 5 agriculture, 25 some form of scientific work, and 22 business. All things point to one of
the most successful and satisfactory years.Terms in Davidson’s history.
