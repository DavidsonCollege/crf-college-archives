“If You Didn’t Read It In

The Davidson Update,
It Didn't Happen.”?!?

If we students at The Davidsonian believed that, we wouldn't be publishing weekly. But we are. These are a few of the things we do differently:

Propaganda is not our policy. We don’t try to sell you Davidson ties, blazers, or rocking chairs—(just subscriptions). Which is the point of all this. We want you to keep up with Davidson.

The Davidsonian won’t update you—we'll keep you informed—weekly. The best part is,

We follow the Wildcats. (The Update only lets you know when they win.) Unfortunately, you’re missing a lot of news.

We print investigations, analyses, and opinions of program and policy. (The Update assumes that Davidson is perfect.) We probe a little bit deeper and point out the problems (so it will be perfect by the time we’re alumni).

A subscription to The Davidsonian costs only $6.00.
