For men only?

In light of Dr. Spencer's statements on coeducation at his September 13 meeting, the ad run by the Athletic Department in the September 20 Announcement sheet is outrageous. The ad reads:

"ATTENTION FRESHMAN MEN: Davidson College Athletic Department is looking for a young man in the freshman class who is experienced in 16 mm movie photography and who would be willing to become involved in 16 mm film production (including editing and splicing) of football and basketball games. If interested, contact Philip Blue at -4831 after 6 pm."

Are freshmen women not able to run 16 mm cameras? Are they incapable of being interested in football and basketball? If Davidson is to stop being a "college for young men who graciously let women join them," mistakes like these should not be allowed.

Rethink freshman hall

Let's take time to consider the freshman hall. It’s a good institution for many students. Fresh out of high school, the freshman adjusts to college life with his peers. Members make friends, establish unity. Often the bonds made between members of a hall persist through all four years of their education. Just as often, however, unity turns inward. The security that the hall provides for the freshman in his initial days becomes a security blanket, in which students turn to avoid challenge or stimulation.

Let’s ask some fundamental questions: Do some freshmen tend to stick together rather than bridging halls and classes to find friends? Do some freshmen depend on their hall counselors too much? Are there freshmen who "do not fit" on the hall and feel ostracized? Do some freshmen need upperclassmen advice, yet do not get it because of a personality conflict with their hall counselors?

If the answers are yes, we need to explore alternatives. Mixed halls would expose freshmen to a variety of upperclassmen who could help them adjust, not to the freshman hall, but to the entire college community. Freshmen would be challenged more than now simply because of the contact with maturer viewpoints. But it’s been said challenge leads to growth. So we're left with two alternatives: freshman halls and mixed halls. One is good for some; one is good for others. A third alternative would be to offer a choice. Provide both freshman halls and mixed halls and let the freshmen decide which they would like to join.

The freshman hall has gone too long without open challenge. The freshman hall is a good institution but it produces too many negative results and has too great an impact on a student's educational career to be accepted without question. Let's at least conduct a thorough evaluation to make sure we establish a system of greatest value to the entire college community.

Ralphy and me are feelin’ kinda low and unpatriotic these days. See, we weren't around last weekend, so we didn't get to learn the words to the fight song like everybody else did during the football game with Gil’s old school. You only sing the damn thing when you get a touchdown, so even though we’ve been here too long already, we still don't know it. Maybe we'll have a chance to be repentant at the game against Goucher.

After all the low things we said ‘bout conventions ‘n such last week, we hate to admit it, but we went to one last weekend. It was kinda a mistake, but a fortuitous one. You see, Ralphy got this thing in the mail and he made...the mistake of readin’ it Friday night in the 900 Room between beer ‘n cruisin’. Well, he thought it read, ‘Singing and Cymbal with Chowder’ so naturally he pulled out the checkbook and reserved us a spot. Turns out we got signed up for a colloquium called ‘Sign and Symbol in Chaucer’, but we'd already mailed the forty bucks and that included a cocktail hour, so what the hell, off we went. It was sponsored by the MLA. Now everyone thinks that means Misanthropic League of America, but as all literateurs know, it means the Myso-Ginistic Linguist Association. Either way, we'd a-fit in. The MLA is kinda pinched for money right now; Joyce hasn't written anything new lately so lotsa folk are writin’ poetry or out of work, or both, or even teaching, so they hadda have it at Lees McCrae College out in the N.C. mountains so they could get off peak rates. They don’t even have a Hardee’s in town.

Well, there were some pretty interestin’ folk there, and we enjoyed what we heard while we were awake a whole lot. Good ol’ Les Fiedler, the fellow that wrote that book "Novel Forms of Love and Death in America" gave the introductory spiel. It was called “The Hidden Heterosexuality of Natty Bumpo”, which of course grabbed our attention. But the big gunhead honcho critic came the last day, as they always do. Yep, Norton Fry, head mythopoeic man, addressed the group on “Symbol and Myth in Magazine Journalism”. Naturally, the response was overwhelming.

This whole affair got us ta thinkin’ as we were windin’ our way back ‘bout the mythical figures of ol’ DC. We could remember a bunch of ‘em, but not a one was still at school. They'd all disappeared: absorbed is probably more correct. Just like a story without loads of mythical overlay and a large dose of artistic ambiguity. The campus wasn't all it could be; why have one layer when you can easily squeeze in three or four, Ralphy asked rhetorically. Well, I couldn't agree more. It reminded me of gettin’ a plain ol’ cheese pizza when a So’s Your Mother could be had instead. ‘Member ol’ Hawk Hoon, pre-med cum editor of The Davidsonian, bon-vivant, motorcyclist and generally cool-type?’ queried Ralphy. I shot back, ‘And what of the other Gozinyas of old, specially crazy Steve? I think he’s even married.’ ‘You're kiddin’. CA and YB are gone, too. Those guys were cool before they even let hoop players run. No more creative craziness, that’s for sure. Wags, Big E, Hooter...gone. And the dog population’s boomin’ since Crosswhite slipped off.’ ‘No more thighs to prove their prowess in the gym or the sheets either. What have we come to?’ ‘Sure is a tamer place. Fireman’s pullin’ beers, Quinby’s quaffing soda, and Kennon is in law school and no one’s heard a Lex. Veazey.’ ‘Faded or co-opted. Sure does make ya think. No more myth. No more heroes. Orthodoxy is closin’ in on the place.’ ‘Us, too.’ ‘Let's get jobs drivin’ a Peterbilt. I hear life on the road is kinda laid back.’ ‘Swell by me.’
