IMAC Reorganization Improves Play
By CAPTAIN AMERICA And NO BUCKY

After a week and a half of the second season of flickerball, C. A. is pleased to note that the
competition is very even. This can be noted in the close scores. Last Wednesday, the SPE’s started their rejuvenation program
as they ripped rival GD 26-20 in what must have been a good game. On the following day, they came
through with a convincing 25-13 victory over the erratic Tennis Sums. The SPE’s are 2-0 and at the top of
League 3.

In other Wednesday action, SAE showed that there can be considerable difference between two 4-0 teams as they smashed the
awe-struck KA’s 54-6 without much effort. Peyton Prospere, Jud Cuttino, and Eldon Basham lead what is perhaps the best flickerball
team this year along with Emanon 1. Meanwhile, over in League 4, the Wimpettes Plus continue to be barely respectable
as they chopped off Turkey C 3's head.

Sidelines

People do not seem to truly understand the plight of intercollegiate athletics. They pretend to, but they really do not.
Since this article will be read following the meeting of the Davidson College Trustees and their anticipated decision on the
fate of football at Davidson, these words are probably fruitless. Nevertheless, I am going to try to say something constructive
about athletics from a hopefully impartial standpoint, which may be more than many who have spoken on the issue recently.

It is universally understood that major college athletics require money for success because they are essentially businesses. At the present
time, this institution does not give athletics enough money to compete on the major college level. So any decision based
on the monetary and won-lost success of a team rests on highly unstable foundations. Furthermore, there is no reason to
assume that, if the football program was allocated a sum sufficient to generate a top-flight gridiron team, they would not
be able to accomplish this goal.

It is my feeling that the government of this college is not willing to take the consequences of maintaining a
top major college athletic program. Granted, there are arguments for both sides. On one hand, the academic standards suffer. On
the other hand, athletics suffer. Very few will deny that Duke University, for example, is not one of the highest-rated
schools in the nation academically. Yet they are able to bend their standards for the sake of athletics. This one
example seems to refute the argument that high academic standards are incompatible with a high grade of athletics.

Unquestionably, it would take time for Davidson to reach a peak similar to our sister “Ivy League College of the
South.” The budget might end up in the red for a few years before the athletic program would be able
to start making money. But college athletics can make money for a school, even if it is just to the
extent of paying for itself. This is the other end of the business status. This is significantly more advantageous than
the present system since there would be no costs to the college. So, if the necessary money was invested, we
could indeed develop a successful major college athletic program, which would eventually cost the college very little, if any, financial
assistance.

And with the athletic program working on a virtually independent basis, it will be able to scholarship a good player
who has no financial need but can play a particular sport with great skill. But this move would take guts
on the part of the leaders of this college. There would probably be a few years of “red” budgets. Sometimes
it would not look good for the record books. As the old saying goes, however, the ends would more than...Justify
the means. 18-12. C.A. had to pick a couple of scapegoats this year and C3 and C4 have filled the
bill admirably. Rounding out Wednesday's action, the North Main Gozinvas continued their alcohol-based rampages as they pounded on PAX by
a 46-6 score. Alcoholism is indeed a deadly disease, just ask PAX. Besides the SPE’s win, some other interesting things
happened on Thursday. R1 forfeited their fourth game of the year to upstairs R3. C.A. was under the impression that
two forfeits meant your team would be transported to the Negative Zone. What is R1's secret? The Cleveland Indians, using
the notorious mercenary Ford “New New” Newman, crushed R2 34-6. Rumor has it that New New has been seen playing
with three different teams this year. That's more contracts broken in one year than Rick Barry has broken in his
life. Cannon No. 1 showed why they are so good as they leveled, rather routinely, the lowly MG's 46-15. Pete
Celentano had the understatement of the year when he said that the MG's just couldn't get it together. Really Pete?

Monday saw the SIF's retain their unbeaten status as they dealt previously undefeated C1 a 50-28 shellacking. Ron Gibson garnered
two key touchdowns for the Fairies in his first flickerball game. The Pikas ran by PAX 31-21 despite the fact
that ace player Bruce Reichelderfer was canned for profanity by referees Barry Blakely and Bob Strand. C.A. has never heard
anyone swear at a flickerball game before. I hope you feel bad about the whole thing, Derfer?! PGD recovered from
an earlier loss as they jumped on the Altoona Aarvarks 38-26 behind Bruce Simpson and Chris Young. S4 players were
playing basketball so the basketball coaches from the Tennis Bums picked up an easy win via forfeit. Sounds like a
minor scandal.

Tuesday also saw the Tribe, mostly composed of ex-Delts, take out some animosity on the Delts as they jumped up
and down several hundred times on their divorced brothers 46-19. Folks, it coulda been a lot worse, too. R1 picked
up its fifth forfeit as they did not show against C4. Bad move R1, cause here is a team that
you definitely had to show up for and win. Congratulations are in order C4, now 2-0. SAE No. 2 crushed
the gobblers from sister hall C3 45-0. Doubtless to say, C3 is sure to say that it was SAE No.
1, not No. 2 that they ran into. And rounding out the week's action, the always tough KA’s rebounded from
an earlier defeat by humiliating the MG's 40-6, as mercenaries Chris Holly and Frank Smith paved the way. C.A. predicts
that Emanon No. 1 and SAE No. 1 will battle it out for the tourney finals as Peyton Prospere and
Calvin Allen face each other in a long-awaited duel.
