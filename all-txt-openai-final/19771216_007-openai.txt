Katherine
No longer gliding from star to star
behind me as I walk alone

~ (for one night the moon stood still
when I walked home) ~

But spinning out science on magnetic threads
to govern wind and tide and storm

(or maybe following still-little girls
who ride their fatherâ€™s shoulders home)

is the moon.
