Pearce Comes to Close of Flaming Athletic Career

By GEORGE GULLETTE

Paul Brown

Paul Brown, of Atlanta, Ga., is an excellent example of “sana mens in sano corpore.” Not only has he been
president of the Davidson Y. M. C. A., but he has also been in front in other fields. He was
born in Atlanta on July 2, 1911, and has resided there ever since. He had both his grammar school and
high school training in Atlanta. In high school, he received many high honors, several of which have been paralleled in
college. He was president of the High “Y” in the Boys’ School. While there he was consistently on the honor
roll. In his senior year, he and Edward McNair were two of the nine boys awarded gold “B’s” for excellence
in scholarship. He was business manager of both his school annual and school paper, but he did not continue his
publications work at Davidson. In high school he earned his letter in track, in the high jump, and has also
been a regular on the Davidson track team. In high school he was a lieutenant-colonel in R. O. T. C.,
and in the Davidson R. O. T. C. he has advanced to the rank of captain. The fact that he
won the cup awarded annually by the Atlanta Journal to the best all-around senior would sum up all his honors
received in high school.

He has spent most of his summers in traveling. Two summers he was in Connecticut, and one summer he got
his taste of Canada. During his freshman year he was on the baseball squad and gained his numeral in track.
He won the alumni medal offered annually to the freshman having the highest scholastic average. His physical ability was best
shown when in his junior year he won the gymnastic trophy, offered each year by the college to the one
excelling in several specific lines of gymnastic stunts. At present Paul is leading the Senior class in scholarship, and is,
of course, a member of the national scholarship honorary fraternity, Phi Beta Kappa. He was president of Delta Phi Alpha,
honorary German fraternity, and has membership in Gamma Sigma Epsilon and Pi Delta Alpha. For the past year Paul has
been president of the Davidson Y. M. C. A., a very important factor in Davidson life.

Charlie Pearce

From the time when as a baby his father taught him to be a southpaw, until the present day, Charlie
Pearce has been an athlete of the first caliber. Judging both from his past life and his excellent services as
president of the Athletic Association for the past year, Davidson has never had a more suitable man for this position.
He was born in Plant City, Florida, in February of 1912, and his home has been there ever since. He
received his first publicity there, when at the age of 12 he was the hero of a 7-6 victory against
the Hopewell Football Midgets. In spite of the fact that he is only of average size (ht. 5’ 8”; wt.
168 lbs.), for many years he has been a stellar athlete. In high school Charlie did not bother much about
studying and never took school seriously, but managed to always get by. He seems to have taken his athletics seriously,
though, for in his junior year he was the first man in the history of the school to make four
letters.

Charlie spent most of his summers in a cottage overlooking the Gulf of Mexico. His chief hobbies were swimming and
Boy Scout work, in which he achieved the high rank of Eagle. He had never heard of Davidson until our
football team licked Florida University several years ago, 12-0. Having been in Florida all his life, he wanted to go
a good distance away to college, and finally decided on Davidson. Since his entrance he has liked Davidson better each
year. As a 145-pound freshman, Charlie showed up well in football, basketball, and baseball. In his sophomore year, however, he
broke an ankle early in the football season. This put him out of athletics for the school year, until the
last three baseball games, which enabled him to make his first letter. In his junior year he played in 39
of 40 quarters in football and last fall he was in 38 of 40. Besides being a flashy runner, he
has been rated by sports writers as one of the best punters in the state. He also passes, making him
a triple-threat man. Not only was he picked on the All-State team, but was selected on the All-South Atlantic eleven
by sports writers, and one of the five fall. His memorable run against Wake Forest last fall will be Davidson
history.

Charlie has also been a stellar baseball pitcher. He handed the Wake Forest state champions a licking in our only
Big Five victory last year, allowing the Deacons only two hits. By the time this paper is published, Charlie will
have played his last college game in an endeavor to help win the state championship for the Wildcats. After leading
an athletic life, most men go ahead with it after leaving college, but although Charlie has...had coaching offers, he does
not expect to continue his athletic career. This summer he will study typing and commercial law in preparation for entering
the insurance business.
