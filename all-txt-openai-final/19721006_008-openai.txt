**Balanced Air Force Attack Stuns Wildcat Gridders 68-6**

The Davidson Wildcat football team suffered a devastating defeat to the Air Force Academy 68-6 at Falcon Stadium Saturday. The 17th ranked, undefeated Falcons were quite impressive, breaking three school offensive records while handing the Wildcats their worst defeat in 51 years. The Falcons rolled up 35 first downs (26 rushing) and accumulated 625 total offensive yards. An 87-yard scoring pass from backup quarterback Bob Thompson to end Bob Farr also made the record books.

“They are a fine, fine team. One of the strongest in the country,” Davidson coach Dave Fagg said of the Air Force. “They had tremendous balance. They can both run and throw extremely well.” This was quite evident as Falcon fullback Bill Berry amassed a total of 149 yards in 20 carries, which was 58 more yards than the Davidson total yardage figure. Tailback Joel Carlsen added 83 yards in 17 carries. The Air Force passing attack was led by junior quarterback Rich Haynie who completed 18 passes for 107 yards before yielding to Thompson.

“They had the quickest defense we'll see all year,” Fagg remarked. “They played pretty much like they wanted to in their opening wins over Iowa and Pitt. I feel positive that they will be ranked among the top ten teams in the country before the end of the year.”

But Fagg felt that the game was better than the score indicated. “On our best day we would have had a fine game,” Coach Fagg said. “We let them get off the hook on third and long situations on several occasions. Silly mistakes like fumbles and penalties hurt, too.” Coach Fagg also noted the inconsistency of the offense multiplied the problems for the defense which found itself with its back against the wall all afternoon. “Lesser people would have given up and been embarrassed,” Fagg said. “It took a lot of pride and courage to go ahead and play and try to score.”

The Wildcats did finally score in the fourth quarter with freshman running back Jeff Heinicka carrying the ball over for the score, capping an 80-yard touchdown drive. According to Fagg, this scoring march was engineered while Air Force still had some of their best players still in the game. Fagg felt the Wildcats fought till the very end. Because Davidson was playing catch-up ball, several wild passes in the fourth quarter resulted in interceptions which led to Air Force touchdowns. Fagg also said that he was very pleased with the Cats’ physical condition and that the altitude was not a factor in the game.

A bright spot noted by Fagg was the defensive play of Woody Montgomery, Eddie Womack, and freshman Jim Deville. Fagg said that Scotty Shipp and Dave Harper both looked good at quarterback. Shipp, who has been injured all season and out of action (See AIR FORCE, p. 11).

**Cats Bet Standing, Style In Game With Appalachian**

Head coach Dave Fagg sees this Saturday's game with Appalachian as having more at stake than conference standings. Fagg believes that the game will be a battle of old against new, large against the small. Davidson must prove that they can still win against the larger teams in the conference. Appalachian, in their second year as a conference member, must prove that they can beat the older, more established teams in the conference.

Both teams will go into Saturday's game coming off disappointing and discouraging performances in the past several weeks. Saturday looms as the test of the Wildcat’s ability to come back. Appalachian suffered a last-minute 20-17 defeat at the hands of Furman last week. Previously, Appalachian beat Western Kentucky 7-6, lost...

Charlotte - there there here herea close game to The Citadel 21-28, and was defeated 35-7 by East Carolina. Appalachian’s strength lies in their running backs. Fagg respects the talents of halfback Charlie Haugabrook and fullback Tommy Harris, who picked up 101 yards in 19 carries against Furman. Fagg stressed that Appalachian has a lot of depth at these positions, with several other backs who, “can really carry the ball,” according to Fagg. Fagg expects Appalachian to run a little more than pass against the Wildcats. “They’ll want to come out and want to win this one real bad after last week's game,” was Fagg’s summary of Appalachian’s attitude.

Fagg has cause for optimism this Saturday. Injuries have plagued the Wildcats for the past several games. Saturday, quarterback Scotty Shipp and running back John Webel will return to action. “This is as healthy as we've been in four or five weeks,” Fagg said. The defense has consistently improved over the last two games, and Fagg believes that this encouraging trend will carry over to Saturday. Fagg also noted that the game, which will be played in Charlotte, will be the first home game. Fagg feels that playing in front of a home crowd will mean a lot to the team. Fagg summed up his feelings regarding the game: “The team has not put together a real good game yet, but I believe that they'll put everything together on Saturday. Sometimes you just get the feeling that this is the Saturday, and that’s the feeling I've got for this Saturday.”

“Before the season started, I told the boys that if we stayed healthy and they played the way they're capable of, then some exciting things would happen on the field.”

Heinicka Likes Varsity Play
By DAVID MELTON

Freshmen are now eligible to play varsity major college athletics, and the Davidson Wildcat football team has taken advantage of this new rule. A prime example of a freshman playing varsity athletics is Jeff Heinicka. The 5-10, 175-pound freshman is now a major contender for an offensive backfield position and has displayed fine efforts in the last two Wildcat games. Against Lenoir Rhyne three weeks ago, Heinicka sparked a Wildcat scoring drive with a 50-yard romp after catching a screen pass. Then in the Air Force game, Heinicka gained 50 yards on the ground for the Wildcats and scored their only touchdown in the game on a one-yard plunge.

Heinicka likes Davidson College football. He feels that “It gives one a chance to play against major colleges.” He also added that “It's not like a job so much here, as it would be at another, larger place.” When asked what prompted him to come to Davidson, he replied that it is “the chance that I could play football and get a good education at the same time.” At Davidson, Heinicka feels that “It's hard to play football and study too,” however. When the Seminole, Florida native first came to Davidson, he didn’t think he had a chance to play varsity football. “I was real discouraged at first,” he said.

Heinicka does think freshmen get just as much of a chance to play varsity football as anyone else. “The upperclassmen help us out quite a bit, and the coaches give us a pretty good chance,” he said. Heinicka, who plays behind John Webel and Dave Ingold, thinks “Everybody has to have confidence to play ball.” Heinicka enjoyed the Wildcats’ trip to Colorado Springs last weekend. “It was fantastic. That was the first time I'd ever been out there,” he said. He also feels that trips like that are good for the school. “It makes football real fun and it also helps recruiting,” he stated.

Heinicka also expressed the fact that Coach Ernie Tall, as well as the other coaches and upperclassmen, have helped him since he came to Davidson. Heinicka feels that the Wildcats can have a good season. “I think we've got the capabilities of winning the Southern Conference championship,” he said. He also admits that right now, the offense is having some problems, but he added, “We know we can win.”
