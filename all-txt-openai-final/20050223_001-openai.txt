SGA recommends
end to sub-free halls

First-years can opt for
sub-free roommates
beginning 2006-07

By EMILY KOTA
Staff Writer

The SGA voted 21-4 in favor of
a recommendation that would
remove the substance-free housing
option for upperclassmen and give
first-year students the option of
sub-free halls for the next year
only. From the 2006-07 academic
year forward, the SGA recom-
mended a sub-free roommate
option, to be reevaluated by the
SGA in the spring semester of that
year.

SGA’s recommendation will be
presented tomorrow to the
Committee on Campus and
Religious Life (CCRL), an adviso-
ry committee to President Vagt
composed of faculty, staff and
elected students.

After weighing the recommen-
dations of the CCRL, SGA and the
task force committee on sub-free
housing, which surveyed the stu-
dent body and held focus groups
on the issue earlier this semester,
Vagt will make the final decision
in time for next year’s housing lot-
tery.

A variety of suggestions con-
cerning the future of sub-free
housing options were presented at
last Thursday’s SGA meeting, both
by senators and interested stu-
dents.

After an hour of open debate, the

For Arnold, hourly
system on the table

By BEN WHIGHAM
Senior Staff Writer

During his campaign for SGA
presidency, incoming president
Ryan Arnold ’06 said that he
endorses a change in Davidson’s
course credit system.

In what he called a “preliminary
opinion,” the SGA-newcomer said
that crediting courses by hours
would be fairer to the college’s sci-
ence majors.

“I feel the hourly system would
be a fairer solution for dealing with
classes at Davidson,” said
Arnold. “I am a Spanish major and
feel it is unfair that science majors
have to spend so much more time
in class than myself.”

He added, “I think the hourly
system, however, should only help
students, and not hurt them. This
means that ‘non-lab’ majors
should not be required to attend
more classes; however, it means
that science majors can take fewer
classes after they’ve completed
their core requirements.”

InFocus
The practical limits of
religious sensitivity

By LIZ BARRY
News Editor

Administrators were careful to
schedule campus-wide events in
light of religious high holy days
this spring. Two major events,
Alumni Weekend and Spring
Frolics, will take place on April
28, a week after the first night of
Passover.

For Eastern Orthodox Christian
students, however, Spring Frolics
falls on the same weekend as the
Eastern Orthodox Easter. The
Saturday afternoon festivities do
not conflict with Eastern Orthodox
services, but the holiday conflicts
with student-sponsored events that
take place on Patterson Court
Friday and Saturday night.

“Friday and Saturday are proba-
bly the two most important days
on the entire Orthodox calendar as
far as church activities and atten-
tiveness goes,” Zach Williams ’05
said. “Orthodox Easter actually
begins on Saturday night. The
service starts around 10 p.m. and
then stretches on into the wee
hours of the morning.”

Although Williams is disap-

Alumni split on Bylaw change

Amended Statement and new religion prof position assuage concerns

By DAVID CROW
Editor-in-Chief Emeritus

The recent change to the Trustee
Bylaws allowing non-Christians to
join the Board has resulted in var-
ied responses from Davidson’s
alumni.

“I would characterize the reac-
tion [from alumni] as mixed,” said
Matt Merrell ’84, Director of
Alumni Relations. “There are
alums speaking strongly in opposi-
tion as well as a smaller number of
alums who are speaking out in sup-
port.”

Alumni were first informed that
the Trustees were considering
changing the College’s Statement
of Purpose and the Trustee Bylaws
late last year, when a letter was
sent out to all 17,000 Davidson
alumni informing them of the
Trustee’s recent discussion.

After the trustees voted in sup-
port of the recommended changes
two weeks ago, a press release was
placed on the Davidson College
website.

Last Friday, The Charlotte
Observer also published a front-
page story about the Board’s deci-
sion and the College plans to pub-
lish a story about the changes in an
upcoming issue of the Davidson
Journal.

However, President Bobby Vagt
said the College would not send
out another letter to the entire
alumni body, calling the move
unnecessary.

Merrell said he believes this
issue has generated more responses
from alumni than any other issue in
recent years.

“I’ve been here four and a half
years, and this has been the biggest
issue I’ve seen. I would say the
reaction has been akin to the
‘goose incident,’” Merrell said,
referring to an incident two years
ago when several pledges of Kappa
Sigma fraternity were arrested for
killing a goose.

The vote to amend the Trustee
Bylaws and modify the Statement
of Purpose among the trustees
themselves was notable for the
overwhelming support from
trustees of all ages and back-
grounds.

However, Merrell did note that
there has been a clear divide
among the alumni who have con-
tacted his office.

“The opposition tends to be
more vocal from older alums,”
Merrell said.

He explained this split in the
alumni reaction by saying that
older alumni are more likely to be
