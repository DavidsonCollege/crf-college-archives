The Harlem Globetrotters

In the midst of March Madness, a reminder that basketball can be enjoyed as entertainment without cutthroat competition pleases and
even surprises us. Last Sunday, March 19, the Harlem Globetrotters performed in the LJVM Coliseum in Winston-Salem. None of us
had seen them before, save for that episode of Scooby-Doo, but we knew the music and, before the evening was
over, we knew “Sweet Lou.”

“Sweet Lou” Dunbar is the reigning “Clown Prince of Basketball,” and this season kicks off his farewell tour with the
Globetrotters. Following in the footsteps of Reese “Goose” Tatum, the original “Clown Prince,” Dunbar was pursued by many professional teams
including the Houston Rockets (he played for their summer pro league), but being a natural comedian and a supporter of
the family, he chose to pursue a career with the Globetrotters.

“I was young and ready to play,” Dunbar says, “and the Harlem Globetrotters provided an excellent opportunity. Friends who really
know me say it was my calling because I’ve always been the practical joker in the group.” Dunbar donates his
spare time to helping youths and athletes with drug and alcohol problems. He also loves spending time with his wife,
playing golf, and collecting cars. He says, “I know that I play for a special team and I recognize what
the audience wants to see. Seeing all those smiling faces makes me want to go out and have fun every
night.” And that is just what “Sweet Lou” does.

The Globetrotters tour the world and have entertained more than ten million people on six continents. They possibly could be
the most winning basketball team in history, having come out victorious in more than 3,400 consecutive games.

What did the audience think of the performance? One young girl said, “I wish they had taken me out [on
the court]. I would have been too embarrassed, though. They did embarrass some of the kids, but it was all
fun.” Her mother added, “The kids love it, and that’s what it’s all about.” We agree. Maybe it was just
the beer and the nachos, but after the Globetrotters left the court, none of us could keep from smiling. We
had been reminded of our youth — of a time when a game was a game and basketball nets were
unreachable. The Globetrotters are for the children, still the practical joker in the group.

Golf team finding stroke mid-season
By JOHN ROE
Sports writer

The men’s golf team is halfway through the season and seems to be finding its stroke. Despite a makeshift lineup,
the squad has played fairly well in three competitions this spring. The golfers placed 14th in the Charleston Southern Invitational,
eighth in The Citadel Invitational and, led by Chris Dana’s third place finish, the Wildcats took third in a match
last Thursday.

“The team is working hard to improve,” said coach Joseph Mark. Their next match, the Lonnie D. Small Invitational, comes
April 2-4 at Campbell in Buies Creek, N.C. “In this weekend’s tournament, there will be a very strong field,” Mark
said. “This tournament will be an excellent warm-up for the (Southern) Conference tournament.”

The team’s top four golfers are Jason Carlock, Andy McDaniel, Jason Lina, and Danny Tedrick. The fifth spot is a
toss-up between captain Kevin Miller and Aubrey Proud. The team’s goal is to shoot a 300, which means that the
top four scorers would have to average a 75. Davidson’s best score so far this season is a 309, but
if the golfers could knock nine shots off that mark, it could make for a successful conference tournament. That tournament
will be hosted by Georgia Southern at Forest Heights Country Club in Statesboro, Ga., on April 10th and 11th.

more, and the kids I coach now are a lot more acceptable."

Born in Pittsburgh and having grown up in St. Petersburg, Fla., Frank started coaching in his senior year in high
school when he coached the freshmen, who had a separate team because they weren't allowed to play on the varsity
team. He graduated from Davidson in 1966 and went on to get a law degree from the University of Florida,
where he did some coaching for the varsity team there for 3 1/2 years. After that, he coached tennis at
a prep school in Atlanta for three years. When he was asked to come back to Davidson and coach the
Wildcats, he jumped at the chance.

When asked whether or not he would keep coaching for a while, Frank said he intends to stay on as
the coach for at least another nine years. Afterwards, he would like to do some traveling and some writing as
well. His advice for anyone considering being a tennis coach? "Find another profession! The NCAA puts a tremendous amount of
paperwork on us, and it's very difficult if you have a family. I advise anyone to think carefully first."

Globetrotters? I doubt it, baby.
"Sweet Lou” Dunbar

What is the one thing you have enjoyed most about the kids? When the kids come, you never know if
it’s their first time. You put a smile on their faces, and I think that’s very important today.

What are you going to be doing after this season? I will still be involved for another year, playing on
the West Coast. I might come back as a coach; I don’t know yet.

Are you going to come back like Michael Jordan?
