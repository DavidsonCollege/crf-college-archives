**Fall Before HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETES**

Last Saturday Davidson played host to a number of near-by North Carolina and South Carolina football squads. As is the
custom at other schools, boys were shown around the campus and were taken to the football game with Erskine. Some
of these boys are ones who rightfully should come to Davidson because of some family tie-up or some other such
circumstance. Others will not even consider the school. However, in the past, we have lost some athletes who should by
rights have enrolled at Davidson and who were befriended by another school and induced to go there. Davidson continues her
policy of non-subsidization, but it is not contrary to the rule, or the spirit of the rule, to be friendly
to these prospective students. Some of the towns represented by the visiting teams are already represented by one or more
students on the campus, and it is probable that most of them are. These men know the local boys and
know which ones are leaning this way. If they will take the trouble to look into the matter more closely,
to make a point to speak to these high school seniors about Davidson, it would help the college tremendously. No
boy who has been an athlete in high school wants to attend a college where no one has ever taken
the slightest interest in him, or where he feels that he has no personal contacts. The coaches try to make
a boy see that he would like Davidson, and it helps him, but it is our belief that a student
could come nearer persuading a man his own age than an older person could. We may be wrong, but it
is our belief that if Davidson students, especially in the Carolinas and other neighboring states, would take the trouble to
look into the local high school athletes, it might repay their efforts. Davidson needs these athletes who should come here
but who go other places instead. Christmas vacation is an excellent time to do such a thing. Won't you see
if there is not some boy in your town who is considering Davidson? Tell him something of the college, its
traditions, its student body, and all the other things that are a part of this place.

**WAKE FOREST LOOMS NEAR**

With the Erskine game, the Cats made their appearance for the last time on Richardson Field this season. A week
from today they take on Wake Forest’s Demon Deacons in the season-closer for both teams. Each team has an off-date
this Saturday in preparation for the Turkey Day game in Charlotte, which will be the last of the Wake Forest-Davidson
traditional battles, at least for a while. The Deacons have shown a powerful team all season, although they have lacked
an adequate passing attack, which has been the best point in Davidson's offensive maneuvers. Thanksgiving will pit the Cats against
this favored team, who will be out for blood in their last game with Davidson, a game which will end
the “Big Five.” With rest for both teams, they should be in top form for the game, with Wake decidedly
favored in all quarters. The Wildcats will be out for the last time and again will be scheduled to lose,
but no one can say that they have let down anywhere along the line in the face of a tough
and heavy schedule. And keeping up in the face of big odds is hard, especially when every man is out
there because he wants to be, and not because someone is paying him to play football. A big-league team would
be fine here—or at any school, but we would rather have amateurs than a bunch of pros who sell to
the highest bidder. A student body is built around many things, one of which is athletics, and as long as
each of these things is kept on a high basis, the general spirit and background of the college remain high.
So let’s stay amateur.

**Watts and West Battle For Interdormitory Lead**

**Outlook Good In Basketball**

Only four games were played this week, but a full schedule is planned for the remainder of the season. The
1939 Wildcat quintet, with the first formal workouts begun last Monday, appear to be headed for another successful season. Finishing
behind only five conference teams last year, squad members are hoping for an even more profitable year. The first regularly
scheduled college encounter for the Wildcats is with V. M. I.’s Flying Squadron on December 15, followed on the 16th
by Richmond. West defeated East 8-10 this week, thereby strengthening their hold on first place. West was led by Keffer
and Barker, who scored 10 and 6 points respectively. East was led by Brooks, who scored 4 points and played
a nice defensive game.

Last Monday, Georgia defeated Duke 21-13. Scott of Georgia racked up 6 points to lead his team in scoring. Vosburgh
was able to score seven points for the losing Duke cause, while Hudson played a bang-up defense game.

**Barracks Win**

Last Friday, the Barracks nosed out Duke 15-14. Monger scored 6 points for Duke while Erwin scored 5 for the
Barracks. In Thursday's game, East stopped the high-riding Watts team 25-23. Williamson grabbed the scoring honors as he collected 9
points. Terrell was able to rack up six points for the losers. In the other game which was played last
week, West won a close game over Rumple, 19-14. Flynn led the scoring for West with 10 points.

**Hilltoppers Schumick Leads Hilltoppers To Three Touchdowns In Second Half**

Blue Ridge Academy's Hilltoppers, showing a world of power in the second half, defeated the Davidson freshmen 20-13 last Thursday
in a thrilling opener of Davidson’s football weekend. Davidson appeared to be a winner in the first half, with a
fine passing attack to push across a touchdown in the first and second periods. The Hilltoppers came back strong in
the second half to register three touchdowns and snatch victory from the fighting Kittens. Soon after the opening of the
first quarter, Fredric passed to Maloney, which carried to Blue Ridge 15, where Fredric carried the ball. In the second
half, with Spencer, J. Bolin, and Shannon carrying the ball, combined with a powerful ground game, the Hilltoppers started immediately
after the opening kickoff. The McEvermen took immediate advantage of the Seceeder’s first miscue, when Hank Bahnson recovered Walters’ fumble
on the 28-yard stripe.

**Leading the Wake Forest attack Thanksgiving Day will be John Polanski (left) and “Red” Mayberry (right). Polanski, a Buffalo, N.
Y., boy, is a powerful fullback and a leading scorer in the Southern Conference. His performance outshone that of mighty
Banks McFadden. Mayberry, hailing from Mt. Airy, is a speedster whose strong point is off-tackle slants. Polanski is a sophomore,
while Mayberry is playing his last game as a Deacon against the Wildcats. Davidson will see plenty of these lads
Thanksgiving Day when they oppose the Demon Deacons in Charlotte in their last game of the season.**

**With Varied Attack In Final Home Game**

**Two Complete Teams Are Used as Cats Score Impressive Victory in Second of Year; Seniors Play Last Game on Richardson
Field**

Last Saturday afternoon on Richardson Field, two Wildcat teams alternated in marking up their second victory of the season, unleashing
a powerful offense to crush a hapless and out-manned Erskine team by a 32-6 count. There was little doubt as
to the outcome of the game, as the Cats struck quickly and often.

**Tigers, Devils Tied For Lead**

Duke’s defending champions and Clemson’s Tigers remained the only undefeated and untied Southern Conference foes today as the 1939 football
season headed into its final lap. The Blue Devils stayed in the running by defeating North Carolina’s previously unbeaten Tar
Heels, 13-8. Clemson was idle Saturday. Duke will engage North Carolina State on November 25 in their final conference tilt.fs

answer for Furman’s Purple Hurricane was unable to get by State's oft-beaten Wolfpack without any difficulty, but lost 12-7. The
most stunning cipher, however, was registered by William and Mary in beating Davidson. As soon as Spearman's boys received the
ball, they quickly reeled off two first downs to the Lees McRae 35, where “Blackdog” Hunter dropped back and tossed
a pass over the middle to King, who caught it on the twenty and ran the remaining distance for the
score. After Hendrix had kicked out on the Beester 11 yard line, the B-Team put on a sustained drive which
ended with Pharr going over from the three. The Beesters’ third tally came in the middle of the third quarter
after Vanlandingham had intercepted a pass from Hendrix on the Bobcat 40 yard line. There Blackdog dropped back and fired
a pass to Meyers over the goal. Davidson started a drive from their 34 at the end of the third
period and Jonas went over from the 26 on a double reverse. Winters kicked the only extra point made by
the Beesters. Following a series of passes with Hendrix doing the pitching and Doulin the receiving, the Bobcats made their
lone score on a reverse with Baer carrying the ball over from the eight. They passed for the point after
touchdown. As the game neared its end, Simonds caught one of Hendrix's punts on the Lees’ 40 and reversing his
field went over for the final marker. The Buccaneers presented a powerful team that has conquered most of its Southern
opponents on this trip. Sam Spencer scored the Wildcats' lone tally after a struggle near the Buccaneer’s goal. Dick Gammon,
Pearce, and McFadyen starred in the Davidson forward line, frequently advancing the ball deep into the northern team’s territory. Joe
Gammon suffered a painful knee injury and had to be removed from the game during the third quarter. The schedule
remaining games include the powerful Clemson team at Clemson on Wednesday, the Duke Blue Devils in Greensboro, and the Clemson
Tigers at Winthrop College, Rock Hill, S.C. Each game should be a stiff one for the Wildcats.
