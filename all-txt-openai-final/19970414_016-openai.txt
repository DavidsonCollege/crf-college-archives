Week in review: Men’s tennis team shines in league tourney tune-ups

The men’s tennis team wrapped up the regular season Southern Conference crown with a 7-0 shutout over VMI Saturday in
Lexington, Va., and a 6-1 win against Appalachian St. Sunday in Boone. Davidson will enter this weekend’s league tournament here
at Covington Courts as the favorite along with second-seeded Furman.

Men’s Track

The Wildcat runners did not score a point at this weekend’s star-studded Duke Invitational, but coach Gary Andrew hopes the
fierce level of competition in Durham will lead to solid results at the upcoming Southern Conference Championships Friday and Saturday
in Boone. “Based on the way this meet went, they seem to be ready to go and do well,” he
said yesterday, citing a slew of seasonal and personal bests. Stan Baker (60.5) ran a personal best in the 400-meter
hurdles, Addam Marcotte (53.76) in the 400, and Jonathan Fly (4:25.5) and Steve Johnston (4:29.3) in the 1500. Freshmen William
Isenhour (15:44), Thomas McElveen (15:55), and Brent Ferrell (15:55.6) all posted personal bests in the 5000, while Dave Foss recorded
a seasonal best. Karim Lawrence registered his fastest time of the spring in the 400, Ken Howard in the 800,
and Keith Gordon in the 1500. “Overall, it was a really good meet,” Andrew added. “The guys are really upbeat
and feeling pretty confident going into the conference meet.”

Women’s Tennis

Preparing for the Southern Conference Championships this weekend in Greenville, S.C., Davidson hit the road for three straight matches, losing
to Marshall Tuesday in Huntington, W.Va., and Georgia Tech Friday in Atlanta, before topping rival East Tenn. St. Saturday in
Johnson City. The defeat at Marshall, a 4-3 heartbreaker, left the Thundering Herd as the only remaining unbeaten team in
the league. Only Lynne Shore, playing at No. 6 singles, won versus the 48th-ranked Yellow Jackets, as the Wildcats fell
6-1. Dana Casner, Ashley Maner, Clara Marks, Claire Cheatwood, and Lynne Shore all chalked up singles victories in Davidson’s 5-2
win over the Bucs in the Mini-dome. Coach Caroline Price believes five teams - Marshall, Furman, Georgia Southern, Tennessee-Chattanooga, and
Davidson - have a legitimate shot of winning the conference tournament championship this weekend in Greenville, S.C. “I feel like
we’ll take care of business against Western (today),” the veteran coach said yesterday. “It’s now a second season for us.
We want to put three days back-to-back-to-back at the championships. It’s going to be all about who does it for
three straight days.” The Wildcats wrap up the regular season with matches against Western Carolina and North Carolina - ranked
32nd in the nation - today and tomorrow.

The women’s basketball coaching staff, which has secured nationally recognized recruiting classes the last two years, is at it again.
The Wildcats will welcome two high-profile post players next season, Jessica Heath and Kim Taylor, both of whom committed to
Davidson during the early signing period this winter.

“They can both play the four (power forward) and the five (center) and are both relatively mobile,” coach John Filar
said Thursday. “They are great young ladies and very, very talented. They should be great assets to the team and
give us so much more depth inside.”

Heath, from Monument, Colo., and Taylor, from Portsmouth, R.I., are 6-foot-2 and 6-3, respectively. Filar has also received verbal commitments
from two more recruits who will likely be non-scholarship players, but still have an automatic spot on the roster. In
addition, a potential transfer will be making a campus visit this week. Filar could not disclose any further details.

Learning from the past
Davidson’s Southern Conference quarterfinal loss to Georgia Southern Feb. 26 in Statesboro was a harsh way to end a disappointing
season of near misses and below-expectation results. But Filar believes this will only make his squad stronger in the long
run.

“There has been a renewed dedication on their (the players’) part as to what happened this past season,” he explained.
“It hurt really bad, and because of that, I think we’ll be better, more determined, and more committed. They’ll come
back with one goal: to get to the NCAAs.”

Demanding docket
After getting off to a fast start early last season, the Wildcats struggled throughout league play. Filar points to a
relatively easy pre-conference schedule as one of the reasons for the drop-off. The solution? Davidson will play UNC Charlotte at
Halton Arena and Georgia Tech in Atlanta next season, and travel to a tournament in Michigan. Ga. Tech, UNCC, and
Clemson are all scheduled for visits to Belk Arena in 1998-99, and Wake Forest is on a list of possible
Davidson tournament participants.

Homer from page 14
Ken Griffey Jr., who had six homers in nine games going into Saturday’s action, and fellow Mariner Jay Buhner (44
round trippers in ‘96) aren’t half-bad either. Andres Galarraga, Ellis Burks, and Vinny Castilla hit 47, 40, and 40 homers,
respectively, last season for the Colorado Rockies. And Larry Walker, another Rockie benefiting from the notoriously thin, mile-high air at
Coors Field in Denver, had six in the first eight games this year.

It will be done. If not this year, then the next year. If not the next year, then the year
after that. The only question is who.

IN YOUR FACE
Head baseball coach Dick Cooke discusses a call with the home plate umpire while catcher Dom Talvacchio surveys the field
during a recent game. Cooke’s team has been on a virtual tear lately, winning seven of nine contests, including a
victory over nationally-ranked UNCG this past week (see story on page 16). Bill Giduz
