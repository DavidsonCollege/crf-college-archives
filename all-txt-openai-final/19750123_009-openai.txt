**‘Slumping Defense’ Plagues Wildcats**

By CHARLIE SLAGLE

Davidson basketball coach Bo Brickels feels that his players need to “concentrate defensively” if they are going to get out
of this slump which has resulted in losses 11 out of the last 12 appearances.

This non-concentration was evident in Davidson’s last two losses. The first came to the tall and talented Gamecocks of South
Carolina 85-68, while the other was to the small but quick East Carolina Pirates 110-78.

The East Carolina loss was the worst in Johnston Gym since 1955 when Duke beat the Cats 107-75.

The loss was also only the third defeat in the last 75 games on Davidson’s home court.

Davidson has thus far this year not controlled the pace of many games. Brickels commented that “we are doing whatever
people want us to do, we have to do our own thing.”

The coach pointed out that the Cats have let Virginia control the tempo and score 58 points and then let
E.C.U. control the tempo and score 110. Brickels says that there has to be someplace in between where Davidson can
control the game.

Davidson did a good job in the first half of the South Carolina game in controlling the tempo of that
game. Davidson played a 2-1-2 zone and despite poor shooting, were only behind five points at halftime to the nationally
ranked Gamecocks.

In the second half, South Carolina started quickly and pulled Davidson out of their zone and from then on it
was all South Carolina as they built up leads as big as 20 points.

The margin of victory for the Gamecocks was 17. Leading South Carolina’s second half charge were center Tom Boswell and
guard Mike Dunleavy. Boswell and Dunleavy finished the game with 22 and 18 points respectively.

Davidson was led by its two Youngstown players, Greg Dunn and Jay Powell. Powell shot well from very long range
and ended his 18 points on drives and short jumpers.

Part of Brickels’ overall defensive plan which the Cats have not done well this year is “to take away from
a player what he does best.” This was definitely missing in the East Carolina game.

**They Call Me ‘The Rock’**

Wildcat freshman Rock Powers makes a move among several South Carolina opponents. The Cats lost 85-68.

**Davidson allowed East Carolina to run up and down the floor at will. The Pirates got hot and did not
miss.**

The big men for East Carolina were Dennie Owens, Greg Ashorn, and Bucky Baum.

These three players coming into the game were averaging less than 23 points a game but in this one they
scored 79.

Owens had 30 on 15 for 16 from the floor, Ashorn had 26 and Baum who was a substitute had
23. All coach Brickels could say is that “we let them get started.”

East Carolina shot 62 percent from the floor in the game and at one stretch only missed three shots out
of 27.

Dunn, Powell, and Kevin Doherty were the only Wildcats in double figures in the game.

Davidson now finds itself 0-3 in the Southern Conference with only seven games left. It is very important for Davidson
to be in the top four in the conference this year.

The first four teams will host the first round games in the Southern Conference Tournament on March 1st.

Brickels feels that the Cats will have to win 6 of their last seven to get in the top four.
He did add that if they were at .500 they might be able to do it but it would be
a long shot.

Winning all these games will certainly not be easy, as Davidson has to play Furman twice and East Carolina away
in those seven games.

Davidson’s next two games will be against conference opponents. The first will be tomorrow at 2 p.m. against Citadel at
Johnston Gym. The Citadel will be led by guard Rodney McKeever who Brickels calls a “great talent.”

McKeever is averaging 24 points a game this year. Then, Monday night the Cats will travel to Greenville to play
last year’s conference champion Furman. Furman is a rugged team and is led by Moose Leonard and Clyde Mayes who
are both demons on the boards.

Brickels will be looking for defensive efforts similar to the St. John’s game against those two teams.

Brickels felt that the St. John’s game was the closest thing that he has seen this year to the type
of defense Davidson should be playing.
