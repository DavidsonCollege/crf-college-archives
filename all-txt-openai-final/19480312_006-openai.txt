If we were to take this plot to an institution in a well-known nearby city and toss it into the
witch's pot after tedious boiling, we would find remaining, Shirley Temple, sister of Judge Myrna Loy. After many harrowing experiences,
the artist falls for big sister and they fly away together.

"RIDE THE PINK HORSE"
Pink horses have about as much relation to this picture as pink elephants do to a convocation of bishops. The
story is actually concerned with a second-rate criminal who goes to a small New Mexican town to try to put
the pinch on a fellow gangster. Since he makes his way through the small town by way of the back
alleys and bar doors, he probably does see some pink things of elephantiacal dimensions. He left the pink horse in
a carnival somewhere. There is also a woman involved who, with her native intuition, senses that this man is about
to die and she wants to help him. Probably without her aid this dead duck would have tried to...die ‘in
vain,

H. “Flybait” Pierce predicted the advent of spring when, with the help of “Hood Norton and Son,” he rid himself
of his winter fleece. We might add that he is now laboring to keep his feet on the ground.

COMMENTS ON FEPC...
(Continued From Page Three)

Society will accept the Chinese, Indian, Italian, German, Russian, etc.; any race except the Negro, and allow them to frequent
our theaters and restaurants without being subject to racial discrimination? Is this logical? If that signed is not FEPC, supposed
other laws to discrimination upon color, will rectify the present wrong with the mere action of the Congress or the
stroke of a pen. Looking back we can see the great progress made by our people toward tolerance and understanding
of the Negro. FEPC itself is a shining symbol of the progress which has been made toward combating this intolerance.
It is gratifying that this issue is of major importance in the political battles to be staged this election year.
At the best, we can hope that the discussions will help those of us afflicted with intolerance and prejudice to
recognize the ill for what it is and not continue to keep our right hand from knowing what our left
hand is doing. Even if passed to become a law by Congress, FEPC would be a poor attempt toward the
elimination of racial discrimination. Rather than propose that law be our mechanism for achieving such a goal, it would seem
that it is our duty to take account of ourselves, to reason out and examine the prejudice that fouls our
reasoning. This duty lies with the individual to think through and form his own unmolested conclusion rather than acquiesce because
it is the course of least resistance. After analysis and test of our stand, will our southern view still hold
water? Ignorance is the greatest ally of our prejudiced minds. Education will combat ignorance and in turn clear our minds
to think properly upon this question. If the students of colleges like Davidson do not see this challenge and accept
it, then how can our nation ever expect to cast off the shackles of out-moded traditions?

HOLLISTER REPORTS
(Continued From Page One)

Not at least ten men among the student body of approximately 900 interested in this contest to enter, that no
prize should be awarded. THE DAVIDSONIAN is in full accord with this sentiment.

PHI LITERARY...
(Continued From Page One)

By reviewing the heritage of the society, the function of the society, and the history of the chandelier in the
hall. In his address, Sam Maloney boosted THE DAVIDSONIAN Feature Contest by urging all the members to enter. At this
meeting, Leighton McKeithen and Tom West were elected as first and second supervisors, and Haywood Brinegar and Herb Meza were
elected as first and second critics. The program, social, judiciary, and steering committees were appointed for the coming term. The
society voted to assume the duties of the monitors who usher the seniors at commencement. No definite plans concerning this
have yet been made, the vote being one of willingness to assume this duty. The election of new members was
announced to take place next week. The Phi Society was founded early in the life of the school and has
grown up with the college, Sam Maloney pointed out. This organization has been a center of campus life, and many
institutions of the school have had their origin in the hands of the Phi. The commencement exercises and the library
have been taken over by the school, along with the governmental activities which were also formerly in the hands of
the Phi and Eumanean societies. Formerly these two were the only organizations on the campus, and they built their respective
halls under similar specifications, much as the social fraternities now on the campus did. The Phi Society now is a
progressive organized group of college men who are interested in creative writing, public speaking, and parliamentary procedure.

DEPUTATIONS GROUP...

Across on a small island that caused him to feel that this would be his life's work, serving man as
a minister of the Gospel. Then Hank Crane related a story about his experience in a German hospital during the
war where he became friendly with a German sergeant through Christianity. This showed him that his previous calling to the
ministry is definitely his life’s work. The calling to the ministry, as to any field of endeavor, varies with the
individual.

I've smoked Chesterfields for years. I know THEY SATISFY.
(FROM A SERIES OF STATEMENTS BY PROMINENT TOBACCO FARMERS)

I smoke Chesterfield. I think it’s a good cigarette. They’ve got the top tobacco flavor.
