Dear Sarah,

We are so proud of your accomplishments over the past four years. You tackled challenging classes, the rigors of dorm
life, assorted injuries, numerous trips to the emergency room for yourself and your friends, and even a close encounter with
a fire extinguisher head-on. You managed to fit the contents of an apartment into a small dorm room with amazing
results. Along the way, you had some great times and developed wonderful friendships. All of these accomplishments will be invaluable
as you move ahead. Happy Graduation!

Love,
Mom, Dad, Matthew, Seth, Sam, Ebony, Ariel, Maddie, Max, and Bella

Congratulations Ilegan Perez!

When you were born, we were the proudest parents in the world. From the first time we put you in
the car seat, the way you looked at us, to the first time we put you in the pool, your
first day of school to your acceptance to college and now graduating from Davidson.

Each and every day we think you could not make us any prouder of you and you continue to amaze
us. Words cannot truly express how we feel about you on this day.

We love you always,
Mom, Dad, and Kylee
