8 THE DAVIDSONIAN

Nationally recognized poet
Hongo speaks at Davidson

By Setu Davis
Arts & Living Editor

Garret Hongo is a poet of voice. To say that
he is a poet of voice is to say that his verse is meant
to be spoken, for in its rhythms there is a beauty not
expressed simply by reading. I don’t want to limit
the reader’s conception of Garret Hongo. His
poetry is not simply an auditory experience, nor
does its quality lie only in the pleasure one gains
from hearing it spoken. There are meanings in his
verse.

Davidson was privileged to have Hongo speak
in the 900 Room on Tuesday, October 26. Hongo
was born in Volcano, Hawaii in 1951. Volcano
and its surroundings exist in Hongo’s poetry, both
as a physical place and a central symbol in the
questions of identity in his verse.

Hongo’s two books of poetry are Yellow
Light (1982) and The River of Heaven (1988).
This latter work, The River of Heaven, was the
Lamont Poetry Selection of The Academy of
American Poets and was a finalist for the Pulitzer
Prize. Hongo’s most recent published work is a
memoir entitled Volcano: A Memoir of Hawai’i
(1995).

It is far beyond the limits of this article to
provide a cogent analysis of Hongo’s poetry, but
what I would like to do is to encourage everyone
to take a look at his work. One of his poems,
entitled “The Legend,” can be found online at
http://www.poets.org/index.html. In this poem
one can see several facets of Hongo’s poetry
which are of particular note. One is his mastery of
sound. Read “The Legend” out loud. The way he
plays with identity, in this case, ethnic identity, is
also interesting. In a description of a man in the
poem, Hongo says, “He is Asian, Thai or Vietnam-
ese.” The man’s identity is unresolved. As evi-
denced by his presentation on Tuesday night,
Hongo is a learned man, and some of his body of
knowledge comes across in “The Legend.”

Davidson was honored to have Garret Hongo
speak here. He is a talented voice in the world of
poetry today. There are a number of wonderful
literary events scheduled on campus this semester.
Please get out and go see a few.
