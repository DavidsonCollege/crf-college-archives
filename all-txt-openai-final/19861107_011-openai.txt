**Davidson sports should consider Division III**

Debbie Podolin

“A tree must not merely stay alive, it must also bear fruit.” Most Davidson athletes are familiar with this quote as describing the philosophy of Davidson’s athletic program. But as I examine our fall season team records, I can’t help but wonder where the fruit is. The soccer, football, field hockey, and volleyball teams are all having tough seasons. The cross-country teams have been slightly more successful, but as to a winning season, that depends on how one interprets their final results. But it’s not just this season, this is reflective of all Davidson’s attempts to compete in Division I.

The argument most often thrown at me when I suggest we re-evaluate our commitment to Division I is similar to Charles A. Neisler’s in the latest Davidson Update: a shift to Division III would lower the quality of students coming to Davidson. Isn’t it ironic that we spend so much time comparing ourselves to schools like Williams (Division III) but believe an athletic program like theirs would obstruct our efforts to attract “Williams-quality” students? “The only thing that makes us the exception is that we are letting Davidson sacrifice our athletic program — a program designed for the students — for the sake of everyone but the students.”

Two of the best experiences I shall leave Davidson with are from the women’s tennis National Championships my freshman and sophomore years. I grew incredibly close with my teammates, experienced intense yet realistic competition, and learned something about my own limitations and abilities. You don’t know how sorry I am that the women’s tennis teams of ’86, ’87 and from here on in, will never get the opportunity to experience the thrill, the pressure, and the excitement of a National Championship. And what makes me sadder is that they are being deprived not because they have lacked the talent (far be it from that!), but they have had the door shut in their face.

Isn’t it ironic that we spend so much time comparing ourselves to schools like Williams (Division III) but believe an athletic program like theirs would obstruct our efforts to attract “Williams-quality” students? Why does Davidson view Division III as so beneath them? Three or four years in Division III would produce several All-Americans and National Championship teams. We really shouldn’t kid ourselves into thinking we're above the schools we compare ourselves to. And why are we always asking to be the exception? The only thing that makes us the exception is that we are letting Davidson sacrifice our athletic program — a program designed for the students — for the sake of everyone but students.

I realize I am setting myself up for much rebuttal in the upcoming issues, but I am tired of sitting on my hands hoping Davidson will make a decision in the best interest of all Davidson students. They haven’t and I’m not holding my breath. I can’t stand to see our “minor” sports made a mockery of for the sake of one “showcase” sport (need I remind everyone that last year was the first winning basketball season in 11 years?). If Davidson wants a showcase sport so badly, I strongly urge the trustees to invest in a Charlotte professional team and allow Davidson to compete at an appropriate level.

Davidson, in Division I, makes me think of this analogy: There is a room filled with water. Eight people, all 10-feet tall, stand in the room with the water at throat level. There is one person, all of five-feet tall, who frantically tries to pile books and other unstable materials on top of one another in order to keep his head above water and breathe. The books fall repeatedly, but our five-foot friend keeps struggling to stay alive. The pile isn’t going to do it, he can’t pretend to be that tall. He is going to drown. Our friend is Davidson — he is in way above his head.

Davidson claims to be committed to a liberal arts education, a balanced and well-rounded exposure to many disciplines. Davidson’s athletic decisions, on the other hand, seem hypocritical of this philosophy. Were we truly concerned about the general welfare of all our teams when we threw together the golf team last spring, joined the Colonial League in football, dropped the women’s basketball program, or pushed the women’s tennis team in mid-season to Division I? For a school that places such emphasis on being balanced and well-rounded, we sure convey a different message in our athletic decisions.

Are we bearing fruit? I see the tremendous numbers of injuries each team is inflicted with, and I can’t help but wonder if we are driving ourselves into the ground. I’ve heard that a referee once said about a Davidson-Furman football game, that if it were a prize fight, he would have stopped it. I’m asking Davidson, no I’m imploring Davidson, reconsider Division III and stop this prize fight.

**Ted Williams: Actions speak louder than words**

Tim Brown

During his 22-year playing career with the Red Sox, Ted Williams compiled some statistics and honors that today’s optimistic players dream of attaining and today’s realistic players only revere: He hit 521 home runs, had a .344 lifetime batting average, won two Most Valuable Player Awards, was crowned American League batting champion six times and is the last man to hit over .400 in a major league season. In 1960, at age 42, Williams crushed a home run in his last at bat. With pride,With possibly too much pride, he walked away from Fenway Park and his mesmerized fans, without waving. He traded in his cap, cleats, his starched flannel Red Sox jersey, and bat for a crumpled fishing hat, boat shoes, a faded t-shirt, and a fishing rod. Some things never change: So it is with Ted Williams. “He still is,” says Williams’ companion Louise Kaufman, “the world’s most impatient man.” In his younger days, after striking out, he would take his anger out on an innocent water cooler. Now, as a well-constructed senior citizen, he kicks and slams the door of his truck after forgetting to bring his billfold with him to the grocery store. He still declares Douglas MacArthur the greatest man who ever walked the earth, labels all politicians gutless, and adamantly stands opposed to any form of communism anywhere. When someone mentions Fidel Castro or Daniel Ortega around him, two things inevitably result. Williams’ weathered and ruddy face becomes shades redder, and he billows profanity in such a way as to draw into question the maxim “cursing shows a lack of imagination and creativity.” However, when he is not worked up over communism or the loss of a large fish, Williams continues to curse and his cursing grows unbecoming: My stat sheet shows that in a recent interview he used the four-letter f-word five times, the Lord’s name in vain nine times. But a linguist will have no luck with Ted and his grammar because, as always, Ted has trouble owning up to forgivable and unforgivable mistakes. His friends admit that a day spent fishing with Ted Williams aboard his 18-foot skiff in the Florida Gulf is not without its rewards. His fish stories grab and hold one’s attention: “I remember one day we were fishin’ for tarpon. And there’s a couple of photographers [nearby] in another boat. And here comes a big old tarpon right down between the boats, a big sonuvabitch. And I laid the bait down there in front of him... and Bang! And sure enough, here comes the tarpon right here into the cockpit. And it was slimy, and there was blood everywhere, ohmigod — the best f----- picture ever. And one of those bastards says his camera jammed.” What is even more amusing is watching a bashful Ted Williams slip on a pair of sunglasses to stare stupidly at the bronze beauties who fill the local beaches, without them noticing. Also, it is gratifying to share in Ted’s love for fishing, which has figured significantly in his falling out of love with three previous wives. Ted Williams never was one to brood over the past. Memorabilia from his Red Sox years cover the walls of his spacious two-story bungalow. One picture shows him shaking hands with Babe. Another picture shows him and DiMaggio and Mantle sporting their bats. But Ted, says Kaufman, will walk right past these pictures as he excitedly hurries to show his favorite wall ornaments to his guests: the first bonefish he ever caught and a 129-pound tarpon that got him first prize in a fishing tournament. Ted’s credentials as a fisherman and his credentials as a slugger compete for praises from his guests. Realizing that modesty can be taken too far, Ted does not discourage his guests from calling him “the world’s best” hitter or fisherman. “Do you miss baseball?” and “Do you ever plan to return to the major leagues as a coach or manager?” are two questions Ted has come to expect, and to sidestep by complaining about the quality of the salaries received by today’s players. The two major problems with “the damn young hitters today” are “they think they know every damn thing” and they think their services are more valuable than they actually are. Currently, there are, Williams guesses, 24 to 26 major league teams. When he played, there were 16. Sparing no words, Williams argues that the majority of modern players have no business standing in a major league ballpark. They would have never been able to find a job in professional baseball from 1946 to 1950 — “they were the great years” — unless they worked concessions. In criticizing the salaries players now receive, Ted Williams lets his actions speak louder than his words. In the 1950s, Williams was the highest-paid player in baseball, with a yearly salary of $125,000. In 1959, against the advice of his vociferous agent, Williams demanded that his salary be cut to $90,000 because he had been plagued by injuries all season long and batted only .254. But to answer the two questions, Ted’s friends say, yes, Ted does miss baseball occasionally. He was lured out of retirement in the late ’60s to manage the Washington Senators and again in the early ’70s to manage the Texas Rangers. He is, to this day, a loyal hitting instructor at the Red Sox winter camps. And his textbook, “The Science of Hitting,” is still a must for little sluggers whose fathers dream of having someday a son or daughter in the major leagues. Meanwhile, Ted Williams lives comfortably off investments, various sporting involvements, and book proceeds. Ted’s eyes, which supposedly can read the label of a spinning record and can see the seams of a pitched baseball, view with pride his fishing trophies and baseball memorabilia. He delights in the feel of a good bamboo rod and the feel of a 33-ounce, 35-inch Louisville Slugger in his sunburned hands. Fenway Park and the problems in professional baseball and the influx of tourists in the Florida Gulf frequently occupy his thoughts. Brown is Opinions editor of The Davidsonian.
