**Humanities Steering Committee Chairman Anthony Abbott**

**Humanities Evaluation Continues Steering Committee Formed**

By DAVID RESNIK

The first- and second-year Humanities staffs have formed a steering committee which will allow Humanities “to facilitate its own evaluation and revision,” said Committee Director and Professor of English Anthony Abbott. The Committee is sending documents to the Humanities staff itself, the faculty, and Humanities students, asking for a program evaluation in terms of its strengths, weaknesses, and areas of possible improvement.

The committee consists of Abbott; First Year Director of Humanities and Professor of Religion Max Polley; Professor of History Peter Krentz; Professor of Classics Dirk French; Coordinator of International Education and Professor of German Hansford Epes; and Mellon Professor of Science and Humanities Brian Shaw.

The committee will collect its information this spring in order to start a major revision of the program during the summer. According to Abbott, the committee will “study and collate” its findings “with the material from the visiting committee” and decide “what direction” the Program will take.

**Humanities Under Fire**

The Visiting Committee of Harold Martin, Marvin Levich, and Jed Rabb released their evaluation of Davidson’s Humanities program at the beginning of February. Partly in response to their report, and also in response to a general consensus gained from discussions with Humanities professors, the Administration decided that “a major revision” was in order, according to Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean of the Faculty T. C. Price Zimmermann.

Zimmermann announced the plans for revision and the appointment of Professor of Philosophy and Acting Chairman Earl MacCormac as the single director of the Humanities Program in a letter to the Humanities staff. The faculty endorsed a Humanities program request that Zimmermann rescind his letter by a vote of 79-8 in a special called meeting. The twelve members of the Humanities staff who submitted the letter called “the manner of the decisions and their method of presentation both a violation of the faculty’s constitutional prerogatives and a discourtesy to those individuals involved in the Humanities Program.”

**SGA, Administration Examine Patterson Ct.**

By JEFF HOLLAND

Freshmen self-selection took place before Spring Break amid questions concerning both the process itself and the future of Patterson Court eating houses. Two houses, ATO and ETC, face problems with declining membership, and the SGA is conducting a survey to evaluate student opinions on the self-selection system.

**SGA Questionnaire**

The SGA passed out the questionnaire last week to all on-campus students. Warren Gould, chairman of the Patterson Court Study Committee conducting the survey, said they are still collecting the last of the surveys and hope to have the results tallied by the end of the week. He also said that student interviews are being conducted all this week.

Gould said that if the committee decides to propose any changes in the system, they will first consult with the PCC, and then submit their proposal to the College President and the Trustees, after approval by the Council on Campus and Religious Life.

**Stability of Patterson Court**

ATOand ETC both face memberships of less than 65 in the fall, which is below the level recommended by Business Manager Bob Currie to maintain a house in good financial condition. A rule included in house contracts signed at the beginning of the year sets a minimum membership for a house at 60 members this year, 65 members next year, and 70 members the year after that.

8 Percent Hike

ATO President Richard Barber said that they have been operating with less than 60 members all year and have managed to come out in the black after a deficit last year. Although only seven freshmen signed up to eat at ATO, Barber said they are working hard to pick up new members. ETC has lost 10 to 12 people this term, according to House President Laura McDonald. She said they have 45 members this term and will add 17 freshmen in the fall. In addition, she said they expect to acquire a few new members with SPE spring rush. She said that they plan to wait it out and try to operate next year with what they have.

Dean of Students Will Terry said that the 60-member rule is only a general one, and houses will not be forced to close if they fail to meet this minimum. “This is only a thing that Bob [Currie] worked out based on the fixed costs of running a house,” Terry said. He said there is a general feeling on the Court that if a house can operate effectively and in the black with less than 60 members it should be allowed to do this. However, he added there should be some mechanism for change. “If a group of 85 people get together and want to start a house, and there is a house with only 50 members in it, it is not fair to block out those extra 35 people,” he said.

Terry emphasized that the rule is not intended to close down Patterson Court. “On the contrary,” he said, “we want to (continued on page 4)

Inflation Forces Tuition Increase

By DAN VOORHIS

Davidson’s comprehensive fee will rise eight percent to $8,105 for the 1983-84 school year, a fee which includes $1,325 for board, tuition, and room costs. Average faculty and staff compensation will also jump by the same percentage. Davidson has raised its tuition 66 percent over the past four years from $5,360 (’79-80) to $8,105 (’83-84). This increase reflects the rise in expenses for the College to educate students. “The cost of tuition and other fees are very responsive to inflation,” said College Comptroller Robert W. Davidson.

President Samuel R. Spencer stated in a letter to parents that tuition now rises faster than inflation to compensate for the decline in real salaries over the last 15 years. “We have three sources of income, generally,” said Davidson. “The endowments, our own and the Duke endowment; gifts from alumni and others; and tuition. It’s awfully tough to increase just the other two in double-digit inflation.”

The Duke endowment is a fund designed to help Duke, Furman, Johnson C. Smith College, and Davidson. The fund supplies the College with almost $1 million per year toward educational expenses. Davidson's $30 million endowment contributes over $500,000 annually. Tuition covers 58 percent of the edu- (continued on page 4)
