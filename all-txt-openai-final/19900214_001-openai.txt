**Dean Rusk Program hosts German officials**

**“After the Wall” conference will focus on German reunification**

By JOE MARIS

The Johns Hopkins Institute for Contemporary German Studies and the Dean Rusk Program in International Studies have collaborated to present
“The Two Germanies: After the Wall.” The program will begin on Wednesday, February 14 at 4 p.m. with a panel
discussion chaired by political science professor Louis Ortmayer. An address by the acting East German Ambassador Norbert Reemer will end
the seminar on February 15.

Other sessions include an opportunity to discuss the German condition with Wolfgang Nicolai, a German professor working at the University
of Georgia, and German Consul General Alexander von Schmelling.

This week’s conference was conceived last summer in an attempt to inform Davidson students of the situation in Germany.

According to Jack Perry, director of the Dean Rusk Program, a year or two ago the possibility of German unification
was “unheard of.” Yet due to the change of events and the upcoming general elections in both East and West
Germany, the possibility of unification is genuine if not optimistic. This week’s conference offers an excellent opportunity to talk to
the experts about the future of Germany.

The Johns Hopkins Institute for Contemporary German Studies was created five years ago. The study’s main purpose is to examine
today’s Germany and is funded primarily by the German Marshall Fund. The fund, according to Perry, is “Germany's thank you
for the Marshall Plan.”

All sessions will be held in the Chambers Gallery and are open to the general public. No registration is required.

**First floor Akers gets flooded**

**Smells of “a wet gym bag” pervaded the dorm**

By JENNIFER HOFFMAN

Residents of 1st Akers got a somewhat soggy wake-up call very early last Friday when their rooms were flooded with
over an inch of water. This incident marks the second time this year that Akers has flooded, the first being
a less serious leak last November.

Richard Terry, Director of Residence Life, said the problem occurred around 2 a.m. when a seal on a gasket attached
to the hot water pump blew. Since the leak was near the bottom of the tank, the pump kept putting
out more water in an effort to replace the water leaking out.

Terry stressed that the problem was in no way related to a faulty repair or a bad design. “It’s similar
to when a belt on your car blows," he said. Maintenance crews were called in at five that morning to
address the issue.

Servicemaster, a professional cleaning service, was called to Akers to help salvage the wet carpets.
