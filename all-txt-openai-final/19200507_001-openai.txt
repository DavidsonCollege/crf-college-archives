Fresh-Soph Debate Won by Eu’s
R. Bitzer and L. J. Bray Win Medals in Interesting Contest

All of those that heard the Fresh-Soph debate last Thursday night admit that it was one of the best ever
staged at Davidson. The query for the debate was, Resolved, that the United States should adopt some policy of compulsory
universal military training. The Phis, holding the affirmative, were represented by Bray, McGeachy, and Burney. The Eus, having the negative,
were represented by Cooper, Bitzer, and Houghton.

Bray, first up, was very fluent in his speech and gave some good thoughts. His debate centered on the following
points: First, the United States is in need of some kind of national defense. Second, universal military training is economically
a sound policy. Third, it is democratic. America owes it to the soldier to have this policy.

Cooper, first up for the negative, had plenty of “pep” and enthusiasm. His argument was based on two main points:
First, from an economic standpoint. Second, from a psychological standpoint. Cooper endeavored to show that the navy was the first
line of defense and that America needed it more than compulsory military training. He showed that there would be no
danger of invasion through Canada, Mexico, or the Pacific. Cooper emphasized the fact that we needed real trained and skillful
men.

McGeachy, second speaker on the affirmative, practically confirmed Bray’s argument. First, it is economically a sound policy, and second, it
is democratic. He showed that our standing army’s expenses would be dropped and that we would secure more labor on
the farm.

Bitzer, second speaker for the negative, gave as his three arguments: First, the great cost of universal training. Second, the
immoral atmosphere around our camps, and third, food production would be decreased.

Burney, the last speaker for the affirmative, added to McGeachy’s argument, the benefits derived from universal military training, which were:
First, physical; second, mental; third, social, and fourth, civil. Love for country comes through rendered service.

Houghton, last speaker for the (Continued on page 8)

Wildcats Lose Three and Win One---P. C. Trounced Severely
P. C. vs. Davidson.

The Wildcat nine, playing in its true form, won from Presbyterian College of South Carolina by a score of 11
to 2. The Davidson lads played errorless ball all through the game and put up one of the best exhibitions
of baseball that was ever seen at Clinton, where they played. As to clouting the apple these boys were there
with the goods, amassing 12 hits during the game, said hits being good for 11 runs. The pitcher who started
out for the Bluestockings fared badly and was jerked in favor of Hope, who allowed Davidson three hits. Currie, for
Davidson, was erratic but in the pinches he showed his quality and let his opponents down easy. He also hit
well, getting two bingles out of four times up. The Red and Black machinetal- lied in the third, fifth, seventh,
and ninth innings. Until the seventh inning, only two runs had crossed the platter for Davidson and two for P.
C., but in the lucky seventh, six more came across, and those runs put the game on ice. In the
ninth, three more runs were added to our total. Box score:

Georgia Tech vs. Davidson

Georgia Tech triumphed over Davidson in the first of the games played in Atlanta, 6 to 2. Until the eighth
inning, Davidson was in the lead, but after a circuit clout by Turner, Tech’s third-sacker, and several singles, the long
end of the score was the other way. Both teams played a good class of ball and except for the
eighth, there was nothing spectacular. Shepard pitched a good game for the Wildcats and except for one bad inning in
which his support was weak, had the Engineers under his control. Murphy, on the mound for Tech, pitched a good
game, allowing five hits and two runs.

Class of 1915 to Hold First Reunion

Class President Urges all Members to be Present — Big Times Planned

For The Davidsonian

Dear Fellows of 1915:

We are five-year-old alumni! So this year’s commencement will be the time and the old campus the place for our
first class reunion. Many have already been writing to each other about this epochal event in our alumni history and
are planning without fail to pack up their kitbags and go smiling to Davidson that last week in May. And
every member of old ’15 will want to be there. We want to grip hands again, renew the friendships and
joys of our years together, find out how much older and wiser and richer and finer the other fellow has
grown in five years’ time; show the Davidson of today what the spirit of 1915 was and still is, and
pledge anew our loyalty to The Greater Davidson.

Are you in business? Are you studying? Are you teaching? Are you preaching? Are you married? Never mind. If Davidson
fires ever burned in your soul, you will want to mark May 23-26 on your calendar and plan to be
on the Hill for all or part of this time. Plans are already being made for the reunion. Write your
ideas and suggestions and whether you can attend, to J. C. Harper, who is serving as chairman of the Reunion
Committee. His address is 159 W. 73rd Street, New York City. Look for a letter in The Davidsonian each week
as to further plans and the list of the men who are coming.

1915 made her mark in Davidson history when in college. In five years, men of 1915 have been making records
of service everywhere. Let us make our first reunion the biggest, most interesting, most enjoyable, most inspiring class reunion ever
held at D. C. Plan to come. Bring your wife, your kiddies, your girl, or just yourself. But come. Write
a card to Harper today.

Yours for D.C. ’15,
FRANK W. PRICE,
Alumni President.
Hartford Theological Seminary, Hartford, Conn.
