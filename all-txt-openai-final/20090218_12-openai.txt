Stephen Curry ’10 was off crutches Tuesday, after an awkward landing in Saturday’s victory over Furman left him with a sprained left ankle. His status is day-to-day, according to Head Coach Bob McKillop in a press release. “I’m feeling better,” Curry told the Charlotte Observer.

While driving to the basket, Curry stepped on the foot of Furman’s Noah States and rolled his ankle. Curry sat out the final nine minutes of the game with ice wrapped around his ankle. X-rays on Sunday showed that the injury was merely an ankle sprain, not something more serious like a fracture or torn ligament. Curry did not practice on Monday or Tuesday, though he did take part in a workout on Tuesday, the press release said. It remains unclear whether the nation’s leading scorer will play in tonight’s game against The Citadel at 7 p.m. The Bulldogs have won nine straight games including a road victory over College of Charleston, who recently beat Davidson. The ’Cats are also gearing up for Saturday’s BracketBuster showdown with No. 21 Butler. According to McKillop, whether Curry plays will be a “game-time decision.”

If this season has been about overcoming mental obstacles, the ’Cats jumped their tallest hurdle last Saturday when they beat UT-Chattanooga for the first time in as long as anyone could remember. After twenty minutes against UTC, the home team led by 12, and eventually pulled out an 89-80 win in overtime. With the Pink Zone fundraiser for breast cancer research, a pumped student section poured into the stands. It would be the next to last game for Mandy Halbersleben ’09 and Mercedes Robinson ’09. Not to mention, the ’Cats were hungry to avenge an earlier loss to the Mocs.

Whatever the expectations, Davidson came out on fire. Coming into the game with a SoCon-leading 14-1 record, the Mocs clearly were the favorites. But 16 minutes into the game, the ’Cats still hung in there 26-26. Led by Monica Laune’s ’10 career-high 20 points, Davidson exploded both inside and outside.

The Davidson basketball team collected a pair of conference victories last week, but may have paid a severe price for their success as star guard Stephen Curry ’10 sprained his left ankle in the second half of Saturday’s 75-60 victory over Furman. Last Thursday, the Wildcats knocked off Wofford 78-61.

Curry had 25 points in Saturday’s game before leaving midway through the second half. The Wildcats held a 60-55 lead when Curry left the game. Despite a ragged offensive performance in which Davidson made only three field goals and only eight of sixteen foul shots over the game’s final eight minutes, the Wildcat defense held Furman to five points over the same period to secure the victory.

Stephen Rossiter ’10 recorded a double-double with 10 points and 11 rebounds, while front court mate Andrew Lovedale ’09 narrowly missed equaling the accomplishment with 13 points and nine rebounds. Brendan McKillop ’11 recorded 10 points, including seven foul shots over the game’s final minutes to salt away the victory.

The senior wrestler won all three of his matches over the weekend, including a 13-4 decision in the 184 division while competing for the final time in Belk Arena as the Wildcats fell to SoCon rival Citadel in their final home match of the season Sunday. With his performance, O’Hair earned SoCon Wrestler of the Week honors.

Jordan Miller led Furman with 20 points, while Bryson Barnes added 17. Last Thursday’s win over Wofford proved to be a tough challenge, in spite of the final score, as Davidson sought to rebound from its first conference defeat in nearly two years. With just under eight minutes to play, a Tim Johnson lay-up pulled Wofford within one at 60-59. With a hostile crowd roaring for their downfall, the Wildcats answered the bell. Bryant Barr ‘10 drilled a triple on the next trip down, Curry followed with a three on the next possession, and the ’Cats continued the momentum for the remainder of the game, finishing on an 18-2 run. Curry led the charge for the Wildcats, recording 39 points. Lovedale tallied 10 points to go with his nine rebounds, and Paulhus Gosselin added nine points.

The Terriers started the game on fire, jumping out to an 11-2 lead. After weathering a half-court three by Jason Dawson, the Wildcats managed to inch their way closer, drawing within 41-36 at halftime. Triples by Barr, Paulhus Gosselin, and Curry to begin the second half sparked a 19-4 run. Despite being down 55-45, the Terriers refused to fold and responded with a 14-5 run of their own that culminated with Johnson’s lay-up. At this point, the Wildcats put the throttle down and pulled away for the hard-earned victory.

The twin victories improve Davidson’s record to 22-4 and 15-1 in the Southern Conference. Wednesday’s game against The Citadel will begin at 7 p.m., while Saturday’s contest against Butler will tip at noon and be broadcast nationally on ESPN. Both contests will take place in Belk Arena.

On the back of her 50-percent shooting from behind the arc, the Wildcat offense could drive the ball at will. Lob after lob inside to Robinson and Julia Paquette ‘10 stifled the Mocs’ aggressive defense. Where the ’Cats outplayed UTC in the first half, they simply outlasted them in the second. The Mocs earned bonus free-throw shooting with 12 minutes left in the game. Alex Thompson ‘10 had to sit nearly the rest of the half with four fouls. Slowed tremendously, the game became a knock-down drag-out grudge match. UTC hit 44 percent of its shots, adding to 14 of 17 shooting from the free-throw line. Yet every time the Mocs narrowed the lead, even pulling ahead at times, Davidson responded with utmost composure. After a miracle three with five seconds left, UTC’s star shooter sent the game to overtime. The ’Cats shot a perfect six for six in the final period. Including stellar outside shooting from Ashley Lax ‘10, Davidson landed a stamina-fueled stomp against an athletic Chattanooga squad. As the Wildcat defense refused to make it close, the home team pulled it out 89-80.

Though UTC held the upper edge in athleticism and depth, Davidson made up for it with pure endurance. “We never really have speed,” Halbersleben said. “But we are in shape better than other teams, so we can run with them. Then on our offense, in transition, we can wear them out.” In the end, those extra sprints in practice gave the ’Cats the edge needed to secure the victory.

**Crawford’s goals push ‘Cats to victory in lacrosse season-opener**

With the ’Cats leading just 10-9 midway through the second half, Jen Crawford scored consecutive goals to break open a close game as Davidson opened its season with a 16-11 win over C.W. Post. Coming off an impressive 2008 season in which she scored a team-high 36 goals, the junior captain set a new career-high with six goals Sunday.
