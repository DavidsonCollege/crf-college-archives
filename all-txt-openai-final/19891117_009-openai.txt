The Davidsonian
Friday, November 17, 1989.

'~Peter Tavernise, ‘90

Delivered

Clad in yellow and black he glides in through the open window shattering our boredom and unleashing a barrage:

black shoe deodorant Bible 20 pages of yesterday’s news laughter spit yelps

He dodges them all.

The breeze cools his engines he thanks us with a grin- and lands on the hardened grease in the Domino’s
box— delivered in less than 30 minutes —now and forever his tomb.

—Robbie McKay, ‘90
