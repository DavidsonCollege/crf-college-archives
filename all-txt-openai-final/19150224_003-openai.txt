MOTT MEETINGS AT CAROLINA

From February 12 to 14, a series of meetings was held at the University of North Carolina conducted by the
great missionary leader, John R. Mott. Several of the traveling secretaries of the Y.M.C.A. and one of the secretaries of
the Student Volunteer Movement were present and assisted in the campaign. The meetings had been well advertised, and splendid preparation
made by the students through prayer groups held in the dormitories and fraternity houses. It was this preparation on the
part of the students and the earnest desire of a large number of the men to get help for themselves
out of the meetings and to help others which made possible the success which attended the campaign. Dr. Mott spoke
five times and held numerous interviews with students. Four of his addresses were on vital problems of student life. About
seven hundred men heard him each time and they were very much moved by the power of his addresses. The
fifth speech was an account of his recent trip to Europe, in which he vividly impressed his hearers, giving them
a new conception of the motives and attitude of the people at war. Besides Dr. Mott's addresses and interviews, a
number of short talks were made and interviews held by the men who were assisting him. Prayer groups met each
night of the three days in the different dormitories and fraternity halls and were the means of bringing many men
to Christ. There were a number and over three hundred men who had been professing Christians took a new stand
for Christ. It was a wonderful meeting and one that will mean much in the lives of the men at
Chapel Hill.
