**Workmen Rush To Complete Renovations**

That Davidson is a quiet and tranquil place in the summer is certainly a grave misconception this year as workmen rush from one building to another to complete well over $250,000 in building renovations before this fall.

Director of Buildings and Grounds Grover C. Meetze sifts through folders and blueprints constantly in an effort to keep abreast of the six individual improvement projects. When students return in September, they will find that the administration has expanded, taking over the entire first floor of Chambers.

C. David Cornell and the business offices have moved into the wing where the study rooms previously were, and the counseling office has been moved to the basement where the news bureau office used to be. The news bureau, in turn, has moved into the admissions and faculty offices, while the admissions office has moved into the office vacated by the business office.

Two classrooms on the second floor of Chambers have been divided to provide offices for the faculty members who were previously located on the first floor. The Alumni Offices were moved into the classroom opposite where the admissions office used to be. The vacated alumni offices will become a reception office and conference room.

“The purpose in making these office changes is to make our administrative layout more effective,” said C. David Cornell, vice president for finance and development. “With the new arrangement, we will have the finance, development, and publicity areas at one end of the building under my control, and the academic, admissions, dean of students, and registrar at the other end of the building under Dr. Bevan's control,” Cornell said.

The Chambers renovations will cost $20,000, which will come out of plant reserves, Cornell said.

Grey House, the white brick building located on the corner of N. Main St. and Griffith Street directly across from the president's house, is nearer to completion than most of the projects. A pre-civil war structure, Grey House is being remodeled to serve as a dormitory for coed exchanges next year with a maximum capacity of 14 girls. The house was structurally sound. The only major improvements needed were a roof and waterproofing the outside masonry.

Downstairs, there will be a lounge area, equipped with kitchen facilities, and three bedrooms. Upstairs there is space for four bedrooms and additional bath facilities were installed. Meetze said that bedrooms will be furnished similarly to the rooms in the regular dormitories. Although it was originally hoped that the historic house could be restored to look as it did when it was built, the college did not have enough money to complete the project. Renovation of Grey House will cost approximately $40,000 according to Vice President for Finance and Development C. David Cornell.

The $40,000 will be paid over the years through room rent of girls staying in the house, Cornell said.

Also near completion is Erwin Lodge, located in a wooded area east of the campus. College officials have been concerned for some time about recurrent damage done by vandalism. To protect against any further destruction, an apartment has been built in the downstairs area of the old structure where a young couple will live and be responsible for reporting maintenance needs and other problems to college officials. Upstairs in Erwin Lodge, there will be a large recreation hall which will accommodate approximately 50-75 people. According to Cornell, all funds for the restoration of Erwin Lodge have been provided by Mrs. Robert Dyer of Chicago, daughter of the late Professor Erwin.

As for the dormitories, major work has begun in the renovation of Cannon and improvements in Duke. Cannon will receive a face-lifting on the same scale that East Sentelle received last year: new doors and hardware, better lighting in the corridor, floor covering in the corridor, new wardrobes installed, and...New desks and bureaus. The new furniture will be the same style as that in Sentelle. The renovation of Cannon will cost the college $100,000, which will come out of the Dormitory Replacement and Renewal Fund. Although there presently is not enough money in the fund to cover the cost of renovating, the college plans to borrow money and pay it back with yearly funds derived from a portion of student room rent. “We were lucky last year to have received a special grant from the Duke Endowment to cover the cost of renovating Sentelle. But this year the college will have to bear the entire cost of the Cannon renovations,” Comneli said.

Duke Dormitory will have modifications including wall-to-wall carpeting in each room, improvement of bath facilities, fluorescent lighting in the corridors, and the addition of a lounge area in the central portion of the building. Renovation of Duke will cost approximately $35,000 and will also come out of the Dormitory Replacement and Renewal Fund. Meetze said that routine maintenance will be done to the other dorms; however, he mentioned that students had destroyed more property in the dorms during this past academic year than he could ever remember. Glass was broken out of many windows, holes were punched through two or three doors, while other doors were damaged by darts and in some cases knives. “In one incident a student deliberately knocked a clock off the wall,” Meetze said. “We had hoped the improvements in Sentelle last year would cause students to be more careful of the dormitory, but apparently not,” Meetze said. Water fights caused much of the tile in the corridors to need replacing, and we found a number of holes punched through the suspended ceilings. “The great amount of damage done to the dorms this year was one reason why dorm counselors were provided for in the governance report,” he said.

Student Body To Receive New Identification Cards

All Davidson students, faculty, administration, and staff will receive identification cards beginning in September, according to Will H. Terry, dean of students. During the first week of school, all students must have their picture taken and receive their ID card in Chambers Dining Hall. “The procedure will only take about 2-3 minutes,” said Terry. “The college has a machine which will take the student’s picture, mount it on the information card, and laminate it all in a few minutes.” Terry said that this would benefit the students in that they would have an up-to-date picture on their card. The college president's signature will also appear on the card to verify that the student is truly a member of Davidson College. “Another reason we're doing this is because we want to have one checkpoint through which all students must pass in order for them to take courses here,” Terry said. “Previously the administration wandered around for three or four weeks before they eventually knew who was enrolled and who was not,” Terry said. “This way we have a sure count.”

million in annuity and life income contracts. The total deferred giving program has added $14.8 million to Pomona's endowment since 1960. Spencer also announced that Peter Sterling, former director of financial aid, will serve as Director of Student Activities in the College Union. “Peter will pull together a lot of activities and programs that in the past have been loosely defined,” Spencer said. “The creation of this position underscores the belief of the union as a program rather than just a building,” Spencer said. “Peter will also attempt to integrate some of the Union activities with part of the educational program.” The president has also announced that Randall R. Kincaid, assistant professor of economics, will serve part-time in the administration as director of career service. “Randy will be responsible for defining the career service program and will also aid in extended studies projects,” Spencer said.
