You've heard of the face that launched a thousand ships, but did you know that the name of Davidson College has actually launched two warships? During World War II, both the liberty ship William L. Davidson and the victory ship Davidson Victory were christened and sailed to support the Allied effort. The naming of these ships was included as a part of the war mobilization program.

The S.S. William L. Davidson, named after the same Revolutionary War general as this college, set sail from the port of Wilmington, N.C. in March 1943. Mrs. Chalmers G. Davidson, wife of the Director of the Davidson College Library, took part in the launching ceremonies, smashing a bottle of champagne against the hull for good luck. Like all liberty ships, the S.S. William L. Davidson was manned by the Merchant Marines, with a few U.S. Navy men aboard. The Skipper was Captain John A. Seagren. The ship made her first run as a supply vessel to Russia via the Panama Canal. Unloading at the Persian Gulf, she returned home to New Orleans after rounding the Cape of Good Hope. The ship sailed alone, and Lieutenant R.W. Drexmit reported that there was no action except firing on a whale. The Captain, however, logged an incident in which a submarine attacked and was repelled by firing. Drexmit commented on the general state of the crew during the voyage: “Despite the fact that a church college bore the same name as the ship, there was little praying aboard except by the natives in the Persian Gulf who would get down on all fours and cry to Allah on the slightest provocation.”

The S.S. William L. Davidson was laid up at the end of the war, and as of 1967, she had not been moved. Since that date, she may have been withdrawn for scrapping.

The S.S. Davidson Victory was only one of a large group of high-powered victories named for colleges and universities. She was launched from Portland, Oregon in February 1945. In return for the name, Davidson College collected a library from its alumni and the community and donated it to the ship. After the completion of her war duties, the victory ship was attached to the Pacific-Atlantic S.S. Company in 1948 and renamed Montana. In 1961, she was returned to the U.S. Department of Commerce for lay-up. She still remains in that state unless reactivated for duty since 1967.

I ran across an article in the library the other day by Hollins College President John A. Logan, entitled “Women's Colleges: an Appraisal” (Hollins College Bulletin). I had heard that President Logan was strongly opposed to coeducation, and I was anxious to see how he had managed to avoid the pressure felt by many of his colleagues in this regard. He began with his view as to why many men's colleges had gone coed. These schools had begun experiencing a drop in “topflight applicants,” attributing this loss to the lure of coed schools. So, he reasoned, the all-male schools used the addition of female students as bait to lure their prized prodigies back to the fold. “It is an inescapable conclusion that the women are there for the convenience of the men, and as an inducement to attract...”them.” It’s hard to logically argue with the slippery generalizations above except to recognize them as such, and ask to be shown these “many men's colleges.” And if these colleges are many, it seems unfair to attribute to the convenience of their male students the sole motivation for coeducation.

Turning to the question of a women's college going coed, he cited finances as the first obstacle. “Capital outlays required to provide athletic facilities” and “larger scholarships needed to attract first-rate men” were among the four additional expenditures listed in the articles as accompanying coeducation. As to the former, contrary to popular belief at D.C., it is possible for a small college to survive without an elaborate program of athletics. As to the latter, Davidson has attracted “first-rate men” (a subjective judgment on my part, I know) for many years with a financial-aid-to-financial-need policy.

Logan answered the claim that it is more natural to study in a coed setting by conveniently declaring: “We should remember anyway that higher education is pretty ‘unnatural’ at best. What could be more unnatural than keeping healthy young adults cooped up in dusty libraries when they are at the peak of their physical prime?” This line of reasoning is insulting to me for three reasons: 1) It is an evasion of the issue; 2) It is painful to think that any college president would equate the experience of higher education with “being cooped up in dusty libraries;” 3) If higher education is unnatural, then the epitome of unnaturalness is separating the sexes, constricting the expression of one’s physical prime to weekend marathons.

The clincher for me was: “Like it or not, the prevailing ethic in this country accepts the dominance of the male, and it is the rare woman who will risk regular demonstration of her superiority in the classroom.” If I were a woman, and the president of my college said that about my sex, I'd be insulted. Hopefully the age of women smiling sweet, empty-headed smiles is drawing to a close.

Perhaps the Hollins alumni can buy Logan's arguments—hoping to keep their alma mater from taking another step toward reality—but I can't. It makes me wonder if the exchange program is not a token appeasement to those who want coeducation. I hope not.

Women’s League Offers Program

To the Editor:

The League of Women Voters extends a special invitation to students to join the “Great Decisions” program, a nonpartisan study and discussion program which focuses on key U.S. foreign policy issues. The discussions are conducted informally in small groups and are based on material included in the “Great Decisions” booklet prepared by the Foreign Policy Association. This year, the booklet (100 pp., $3.00) contains eight sections, one for each of the topics to be considered, according to the following weekly schedule:

1. Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia: Which way to peace and when? Feb. 7
2. The Middle East conflict: Is a peaceful settlement possible? Feb. 14
3. Latin America and the U.S.: How can we improve hemispheric relations? Feb. 21
4. Man and his environment: What price survival? Feb. 28
5. Communist China and the U.S.: Can we live in peace? Mar. 7
6. Dissent, public opinion and foreign policy: How responsive is our system? Mar. 14
7. West Germany: What role in Europe? Mar. 21
8. National priorities and world peace: What directions for the U.S. in the 1970s? Mar. 28

The League of Women Voters is coordinating this program in Davidson and hopes there will be enough interest to form several groups, with 10 to 12 members in each group. Each group will select a moderator or rotate the responsibility among its members. The time and place of meeting will also be determined by the group.
