THE DAVIDSONIAN

(thick thoughts of you from "The Raven")

With each sip I know it even more;
the cup in my hand as thick as
the gums in my mouth as thick as
your hair in my fingers as thick as
your fingers stroking my back
and I know to leave you alone
to put the snakes back in their tank
to go home and lock the door behind me.

Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered,
weak and weary, over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
suddenly there came a tapping,
as of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
"'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door—
Only this and nothing more."

Edgar Allan Poe

Edgar Allan Poe once attended The United States Military Academy at West Point. He was kicked out when he showed up to a morning formation wearing nothing but a sash across his chest and an ammunition pouch on his hip.

Welcome back to The Student Body. This week we were very upset to see that our designated mailbox was empty. We encourage you all to send letters to: The Student Body, c/o Mitch Shores; PO Box 4180. We really hope to address some interesting health concerns ranging from masturbation to relaxation techniques. We are open to a variety of concerns from the students here at Davidson. Please remember that the letters will be confidential, and anonymity will be preserved.

Send your health questions to:

Since we did not receive any questions, we decided to talk about something we witnessed this past week. There was a mixer that we had the pleasure to attend. It was a very interesting mixer which progressed to anti-mixing between the guys and girls involved. The evening started with an ice breaker entitled “A Safer Sex Mixer”. The group then proceeded to describe the ideal date. They were each given an index card, and they did not have to sign their name to the card. We were surprised at the responses. While some took it in a more serious manner, there were a few who made this an opportunity to be a little crass. The mood was such that many of the participants felt uncomfortable discussing their thoughts, opinions, desires, etc.

While we enjoy seeing a light-hearted hall program, it is important that we share ideas in an honest, open fashion. There were some great ideas about dating. We really wanted to demonstrate that there are some great things that Davidson students can do to date.

With comments like, “I hope she sucks like a vacuum!” and “Grab my grundle,” it is going to be a tough year for some of these boys.
