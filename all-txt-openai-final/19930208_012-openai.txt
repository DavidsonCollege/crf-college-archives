Men's Hoops Comes Up Short Against Ga. Southern

By Chris Hood

As has been the case on the road throughout the season, Davidson’s men’s basketball team battled its opponent before a second-half dry spell halted forward progress. On Saturday, it was Georgia Southern which finished strongly, besting the ‘Cats, 83-71, in Statesboro. With the defeat, Davidson slipped to 6-5 in the Southern Conference, a half-game behind fifth-place Appalachian State, heading into Sunday’s contest at The Citadel.

Davidson closed the first half with a flurry, returning from a 33-20 deficit with 4:35 remaining to make a 14-4 run. Jeff Anderson was the catalyst, scoring seven straight points on a pair of jumpers and a three-pointer. At the half, the ‘Cats trailed 37-34.

The clubs remained close during the first 10 minutes of the second half; when George Spain scored off of a rebound with 10:29 left, the score was tied at 54. Davidson would never be as close again, as the Eagles took off on a streak of their own.

With just over four minutes remaining, Jason Zimmerman missed a three-point shot; the ball went out of bounds to the home club. Thinking he had been fouled, he and Chris Alpert argued with

Women's Hoops Forges Ahead

By Robert Lloyd-Still

The Davidson women’s basketball team continues to make great strides as the schedule becomes more difficult. After traveling to Lexington, Va., last weekend, the Cats returned home for games with Liberty and Wofford. The ‘Cats began the week with an 86-40 trouncing of Washington and Lee. Though it is only a club team, W&L is preparing for entrance into Division III.

On Wednesday, Davidson played hard and showed some marked improvements. Although the Cats lost to Liberty, 71-54, Davidson was in the game until late. Earlier this season, the ‘Cats had lost to the Flames by twice that margin, 74-40. Head coach John Filar stated in the Charlotte Observer, “Liberty is one of the strongest teams we have faced all season. They rebound extremely well and play a very physical game.”

The Cats played an excellent first half and led at halftime, 27-24. After the intermission, Theresa Bream, sister of Atlanta Brave Sid Bream, stepped up, and the Flames pulled away. Freshman sensation Erin Butcher played another fine game with 16 points and 14 rebounds. Coach Filar summed up the team’s performance in the Observer: “Most important for us in this game is to put together two solid halves of play. They have a very experienced squad, starting four seniors, but if we play like we played in the first half of the game, there’s no reason we can’t come away with a victory.”

On Saturday night, things did not get any easier for the ‘Cats. Wofford’s offense was too much, and Davidson lost 70-61. Wofford came into Davidson with a 17-3 record and an amazing average of 77.3 points per game. The game looked much like the Liberty one, as the Cats started with a flourish and only trailed by two at halftime, 30-28. However, the Cats faltered early in the second half, and the Terriers took control. At the end of the game, the Cats made a valiant comeback with two three-pointers by Maggie Young, but Davidson fell short. Butcher had another huge game for the Cats with 20 points and 18 rebounds.

The ‘Cats’ next game is at Western Carolina Wednesday evening.

Swimming and Diving Show Improvement Versus Ga. Southern Prepare for Upcoming Southern States Championships

By Will Cobb

The Davidson swimming and diving team traveled to face the Georgia Southern University squad on January 29th. Both the women’s and men’s squads showed obvious improvement from earlier in the year with very good times. After last weekend’s match with Duke, the team is left with only one remaining meet, being the Southern States Championships at Davidson on the weekend of February 19-21. The team shows all signs of a much better showing from last year’s first-time competition in the meet.

In the Georgia Southern men’s competition, Churchill Hoof continued his outstanding performance this year by winning both the 200 and 500 yard freestyles, while Kevin Boler captured 2nd in the 50 yard freestyle, and Corey Bean seized 2nd in the 200 yard individual medley along with 1st in the 100 yard butterfly. The diving team turned out an excellent performance by sweeping both the 1-Meter and 3-Meter diving competitions. The men ended up losing to Georgia Southern by a score of 126-97.

The women came very close to defeating Georgia Southern, losing 111-103. Jennifer Scheutz took first in the 100 yard backstroke and third in the 200 yard individual medley, while Rebecca Falkenburg finished 3rd in the 50 yard freestyle and Kate Evans lost a close race in the 200 yard freestyle, finishing second by only 0.02 seconds. The women’s diving team also swept Georgia Southern in both the 1-meter and 3-meter diving as Paige Hull won both events. Tara Cox produced two personal bests in the 100 yard butterfly and 500 yard freestyle.

Both squads anxiously await the Southern States Championships in just two weeks, hoping to build on the team’s growing success throughout the season.
