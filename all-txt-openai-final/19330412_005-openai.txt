’CAT NINE PLANS SIX-GAME CAMPAIGN DURING HOLIDAYS

THE SPORTS PARADE

DAVIDSON CINDERMEN ENCOUNTER ’GATORS AT GAINESVILLE SATURDAY

FIRING AT RANDOM
CASKIE NORVELL, Jr.

Coach Laird’s boys continued the good work during the past week, with three more victories added to the string. This gives them four wins in as many starts. The 20-8 massacre of the Lenoir-Rhyne team showed that the local apple knockers could bat. Shaky fielding put George Baily in a bad hole at the start of the game with Union but the slugging coterie backed him up, and the ’Cats overcame a four-run handicap to turn back the Preachers, 9 to 4. Southpaw Baily pitched brilliant ball thereafter, allowing the Virginians but two bingles in the latter seven innings. “Whimpy” Ravenel, utility “man de-luxe,” crashed the spotlight when he started the Seminary rally by driving in three runs with a flaming single. He and Ken Weeks filled in for the Seminary as some of their players were a bit tardy in arriving for the game. Of a certainty, if “Whimpy” continues doing his teammates that way, the coach will be forced to do something about it.

The Wildkitten nine took a trio of nice lacings last week, dropping scraps to Mount Pleasant Collegiate Institute, Charlotte High School, and Louisburg College. In the former, Jenkins, pitching for Davidson, fanned fourteen Cadets, but poor support in the pinches served to defeat him, 5 to 2. The affair with the high school was a free slugging game, ending 17 to 9.

The tennis team swung into action during the past week and won two out of three matches played on a southern tour. South Carolina bowed to the Wildcats, while the locals dropped matches to Georgia Tech and Emory. Billy Reese, Cotton States singles champion, turned back Jimmy Halverstadt, top-ranking Davidson player, in the Davidson-Tech encounter. The yearling racqueteers opened their season auspiciously by turning back the Darlington netters in a close match. Potts, number one for the prep school boys, turned in the best tennis of the day, by tripping Lewis in the feature singles match of the afternoon.

The track team remained idle during the past seven days. However, the cindermen are planning an invasion of Gainesville to take on the highly-touted Florida ’Gators, who will be minus the services of the famous Joe Hall, decathlon champion. The freshman track team was barely a winner in a triangular meet with Charlotte High and Winston-Salem High as the other participants. Frazier and Ras Evans again took the spotlight by grabbing off two first places apiece. Johnnie Pearse also came in for due recognition, taking first place in the javelin throw, thus deciding the meet in favor of the ’Kittens.

A sure sign of spring is the beginning of inter-class baseball. The old pastime has gotten into full swing on the diamond between Chambers and Dormitory Row, and the league is functioning, with the champions yet to be crowned, and a hot race is in progress.

A Davidson team, often neglected, has shown up exceptionally well this year. I refer to the rifle team. Very few people seem to be interested in what the Davidson rifle team is doing. These boys have had an excellent season, and deserve your praise. Nice going, fellows.

Congratulations are in order for Fred Dickerson, star Davidson athlete. Fred has just been appointed director of athletics and head football and basketball coach at Lees-McRae Junior College next year. Don King, also a Davidson man, held this position during the past year.

In their only match during the past week, the Davidson golfers met defeat at the hands of the University of Georgia. The Bulldogs are noted for their fine representation on the links, and they had a hard time sending back the ’Cats 10½ to 7½. Jack Wagner, at number one for the locals, shot a sub-par round of 71, and won over his opponent 7 and 5. He was also highly instrumental in winning three more points, pairing with Captain Caldwell to turn in a best ball score of 67.

Mills’ Homer in First Scores Mock and Peabody

HARRIS AND WEST PITCH
Little and Hughes Are Leading Hitters for Lenoir-Rhyne

The Davidson varsity batted hard last Thursday to pound out a 20 to 8 victory over the Lenoir-Rhyne Bears. In the course of the game, the Wildcats touched three opposing pitchers for a total of 18 base hits. The ’Cats were in the lead from the first inning when Buck Mills’ home run scored Mock and Peabody ahead of him. Mackorell, Mills, and Morris led the hitting for the afternoon. Mackorell got four for six, Mills three for five, and Morris got three for four, including a homer. For Lenoir-Rhyne, Little with three for three, and Hughes with three for five led the stick wielders. Harris, pitching for Davidson, had a good afternoon, giving up but 11 scattered hits during the seven innings he pitched. West, who relieved him, allowed only two hits. The Wildcats had no big inning, but scored consistently throughout the game. Lenoir-Rhyne scored five of their eight runs in the seventh.

Wildkittens Lose to Mount Pleasant, 5-2

The Davidson Wildkittens met their first defeat when they tackled the Mount Pleasant Falcons. The Falcons came out on top with a score of 5 to 2. This makes three out of four victories for the Mount Pleasant diamond men. The Davidson freshmen let down their pitcher by making six errors, while Jenkins, pitcher, struck out fourteen men, and let only eight hits get by him. Mount Pleasant has begun a trip, playing all the freshman teams in the state. These will include the North Carolina freshmen and other colleges in the state.

Wildcat Nine Rallies to Defeat Union Seminary

Preachers Score Four Runs in Second Inning and Grab an Early Lead

Coach “Red” Laird’s Wildcat nine defeated Union Seminary Saturday, after tallies in the fourth, sixth, and eighth innings enabled them to overcome a four-run lead and chalk up nine runs to the visitors’ four. Singles by Price, Roberts, Kidd, and Lawrence in the second inning set the Preachers off to their four-run lead, but this was halted and George Baily, ’Cat left-hander, conquered.His wildness to pitch superb ball for the remaining seven cantos. Soon the Wildcats scored one run in the second stanza, but not until the fourth were they able to hit the spheroid to any avail. In this period, Morgan, Morrison, Whitley, and Baily hit for one base each, accounting for three scores. Two innings later, Morrison slapped out a double, which was followed by singles on the part of Morris and Whitley, sending in two more runs. Later in the contest, Bumgarner hit the Whitley, Seminaty, Baily, and hurler for three singles to score a trio of counters. Baily allowed the Parsons only six hits, four of which were garnered in that disastrous second inning. Atkins, visiting pitcher, was tapped for 15 blows by the “Lairdmen.” Morrison and Whitley got three knocks apiece, while Mackorell and Baily came through for two each to lead the day’s batting.

My Greatest Thrill
AS TOLD BY BUCK MILLS

My greatest thrill, I think, came in the Davidson-The Citadel game during the football season of 1931. I was a sophomore then, and as I had suffered a shoulder injury in the first game of the season, it was the first game I had started in since that time. “Monk” had me playing at the safety position, and the opening kickoff landed squarely in my arms, so I checked out, and the next thing that I was conscious of was The Citadel’s 15-yard line. Later on in the game, I got loose again, but I believe that this was my greatest thrill.

Allen L. “Buck” Mills hails from Statesville, where he was a prominent athlete before entering Davidson. Since he has been at Davidson, he has established himself as a splendid athlete. He won numerals in football and baseball in his freshman year. For three years he has had a place on the varsity football and baseball teams, playing halfback on the former and shortstop on the latter. He is president of the “D” Club and has served as vice-president of the Athletic Association.

Tennis Team Returns From Southern Tour

In its southern tour, the Davidson tennis team met Emory University, Georgia Tech, and the University of South Carolina on April 6, 7, and 8, respectively. The Wildcat netmen were defeated by the first two but managed to edge out a victory over the South Carolinians. Detailed report of the individual matches follows:

At Emory University, Frank Morrison of Emory defeated Tom Phifer, 6-1, 4-2. Rain halted both this match and that of S. R. Bridges and D. B. Elvery, which resulted in favor of Bridges of Emory with a score of 6-4, 6-1. Charlie Myers of Davidson defeated McDaniels of Emory, 6-2, 5-2. The remainder of the matches were rained out.

Georgia Tech scored a victory over the Wildcats to the tune of 4 to 2. Billy Reese, Cotton States singles champion, defeated Jimmy Halverstadt, 8-6, 4-6, 6-4. This match proved especially thrilling, as Halverstadt threatened to overturn the scoring with set points three or four times. Charlie Myers defeated Crawford of Tech, 6-3, 3-6, 6-1. Thompson beat West of Tech, 6-3, 6-3. Jackson of Tech beat Elvery, 6-4, 3-6, 6-3. Rivers of Tech beat Phifer, 6-0, 7-5. Keiser of Tech defeated Morrow, 1-6, 7-5, 6-3. Then for the doubles, Halverstadt and Myers played Reese and Crawford of Tech, ending in a tie of one set each at nightfall. Thompson and Elvery were playing West and Jackson of Tech, and each had one set when the match was called off at darkness. For the third doubles team, Phifer and Morrow played Keiser and Rivers of Tech, the Georgians winning one set, and the last set standing nine-all in games when the match was called off at darkness, also.

At South Carolina, Halverstadt defeated Killingsworth of South Carolina, 6-3, 3-6, 8-6. Moore of Carolina defeated Myers, 7-5, 7-3. Thompson defeated Ellison of Carolina, 7-9, 6-1, 6-4.

In the doubles matches, Halverstadt and Myers defeated Killingsworth and Moore of Carolina, 6-8, 6-2, 6-3. Ellison and Powell of Carolina defeated Thompson and Elvery, 6-2, 6-3. Gooding and Mann of Carolina defeated Morrow and Phifer, 6-4, 6-4.

The netmen will enter the State Meet held at Duke, April 17, 18, and 19. After that, they will begin their northern trip and return to the campus.
