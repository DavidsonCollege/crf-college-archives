Still full of rage, bitterness & discontent, Pearl Jam delivers Vs.
By Rachel Newcomb

At the MTV music awards earlier this year, Pearl Jam performed the song “Animal” from their new album, Vs. It was a frenzied, agonized performance that left the audience crying for more. They followed by playing an excellent rendition of Neil Young’s “Keep on Rockin’ in the Free World” with the man himself, Neil Young. After the song was over, Pearl Jam smashed their instruments and the microphone stands, while Neil Young placed his guitar calmly in its holder and walked off stage. Smashing instruments is by no means an uncommon gesture for a rock musician, but in this case, it simply made a generational statement.

It has been a while since Pearl Jam’s first album, Ten, which sold over six million copies. Unfortunately, the fact that Pearl Jam comes from Seattle has caused many to label their music as “grunge” and dismiss it as part of a fad. Since the widely successful release of Ten in early 1992, critics and fans have waited eagerly to see what move Pearl Jam will make next. The product, Vs., has been well worth the wait. It shows a band that refuses to change with success, a band that hasn’t lost touch with its audience and still firmly knows how to make good music. If anything, Pearl Jam has distanced itself from the “grunge” scene by creating an album that defies categorization: Success hasn’t affected their music in a negative way at all.

A lot of the songs on Vs. have an undertone of violence to them, and a few are decidedly political, but never pretentious. When Pearl Jam writes about subjects like gun control and police brutality, they don’t come across as sounding preachy, just disturbed about things they see around them. There is no happy idealism on this album, and songs like “Drop” reflect the alienation of a young generation confronted with a confusing, complicated world. “Troubled souls unite,” lead singer Eddie Vedder fairly shouts, “I am lost.”

The album opens with “Go,” a tune with a driving drum beat and bass line. In “Animal,” the next song, Vedder’s howl of rage is perfectly complemented by the powerful guitar work of guitarists Stone Gossard and Mike McCready. The third cut, “Daughter,” is one of the best cuts on the album. With its slightly acoustic guitar sound cutting down on the excess noise, it allows Vedder's forceful, highly emotive voice to be heard clearly. With the song’s themes of generational conflict, Vedder’s voice conveys a strong sense of anger and dislocation.

"...Pearl Jam has distanced itself from the 'grunge' scene by creating an album that defies categorization."

“Glorified G” begins with upbeat drum rhythms and guitar melody, as Vedder casually tosses off the opening line, “Got a gun/ Fact I got two, that’s okay man, cause I love God.” His flippant tone satirizes gun freaks and their toys as the chorus continues, “Glorified version of a pellet gun.” “Dissident” is a tune reminiscent of some of the songs on Ten, Pearl Jam’s last album, and is good but not especially interesting. I like the wah-wah guitar in the song, “Blood,” but the vocals and music

are somewhat noisy and on the tuneless side. “Rats” is another dark cut, Vedder’s voice chanting low against the drums, then finally singing passionately. My two favorite cuts on the album, “Daughter” and “Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town,” both showcase Vedder’s hauntingly anguished voice. “Elderly Woman” is especially poignant, with Vedder’s reflections on an anonymous woman he sees behind a lunch counter. Seeing the woman triggers introspection into his own life, and there is something profoundly sad about the lyrics: “I changed by not changing at all / Small town predicts my fate.” His voice is full of emotion as he cries, “My god, it’s been so long... never dreamed you’d return.” The song ends with the soft refrain, “Hearts and thoughts they fade... fade away.”

Eddie Vedder’s voice is distinct and passionate, stirring with stark emotion, and Vs. showcases this better than Ten. It is unclear where Pearl Jam will find themselves in the future, and it remains to be seen whether Vedder will occupy a similar historical place as other dark, doomed lead singers (Jim Morrison). He’s got the charisma, the looks, the powerful sexuality on stage, and the enigmatic, unsettling lyrics. His voice contributes to the music’s distinctiveness on Vs. Drummer Dave Abbruzzese’s percussion is very strong throughout this album, which is laced with a funk-influenced sound. Unlike a lot of other progressive bands, especially bands from Seattle, Pearl Jam is capable of creating tuneful melodies that still express a great deal of rage and discontent. Their music has an edge to it, and the band doesn’t stick to formulas when creating a song. Vs. is about as different from Ten as it could be, and is in fact, better.
