**Staff Editorial**

**The clarity of hindsight**

In light of another bumpy housing selection process, it’s time for some common sense changes to be made.

RLO should add phases to the lottery system to address student complaints. Just as the mini-lottery for Martin Court F
worked beautifully, RLO should devise a mini-lottery for both vacant four-person apartments and substance-free housing.

When students selected rooms this year, some who had petitioned RLO for substance-free housing chose larger or otherwise better rooms
in other dorms, leaving Little open for rising sophomores who did not desire to be sub-free.

As Little filled up with non-sub-free kids, some who had signed the petition were left without housing, and will likely
not get sub-free housing.

As a result, both groups are unhappy. If a substance-free lottery were to be held first, this problem would largely
disappear.

**Happy (activities) tax day!**

SGA is guaranteed five percent of Activity Tax Council allocations upon request, a sum of roughly $20,000. Last year, SGA
had a hard time spending its $12,500 budget and made honorable but questionable donations to charity out of its special
projects budget.

The special projects fund itself is a sort of slush fund. By not defining what the funds are used for,
the money escapes oversight and can be directed into uses such as the donations, which bring no direct benefit to
student life. This money could be better spent if it were allocated to other campus organizations.

The ATC frequently criticizes chartered organizations for end-of-year spending sprees to exhaust funds that would otherwise return to ATC control.
In making these donations, SGA has done just that.

The donations themselves lead down a slippery slope, as no guidelines have been established to determine what makes a charitable
cause worthy of receiving an SGA donation.

The five percent clause should be abolished. No organization should have a guaranteed cut of ATC dollars. As the flagship
student organization, SGA should be the leader in submitting to ATC guidelines, and it should quit dragging its heels.

**Be aware of rise in Internet plagiarism**

As newly elected Chair and Vice-Chair of the Honor Council, we’d like to take this opportunity to introduce ourselves and
express a growing concern.

The Honor Council has noticed a disturbing trend over the past year. There have been an increasing number of honor
infractions involving plagiarism. In many of these recent cases, students have taken large portions of Web-based documents in a “cut
and paste” fashion without using proper citation.

The Honor Council considers such cases of plagiarism serious violations of the Honor Code. Using another person’s ideas without proper
citation, regardless of where they are found, is dishonest. It’s also not very smart because professors can use Yahoo and
Google. In most of the recent cases relating to plagiarism, professors discovered the academic dishonesty in that very manner.

The Honor Council and professors here do not want to see any more instances of plagiarism stemming from improper use
of academic sources on the Web. Take responsibility for your work. Don’t allow a stressful academic period to become an
excuse to sacrifice your honor. In the long run, your personal integrity is far more important than any letter grade.

If you have any questions about the proper way to cite an electronic source, please make sure and consult with
your professor to clarify any of your concerns.

**College can never replace McKelvey**

Last week Sam McKelvey, Director of Public Safety, was forced by the administration to resign. It is important for the
student body to know about his resignation because of his close relationship with many students and his dedication to the
Davidson community. Sam’s resignation is a disappointment to us all.

Sam has a distinguished record in public and college law enforcement. His forced resignation came as a shock to him,
his office and his many friends in the community.

Sam’s dedication to the College ranged from riding with students for hours looking for their bikes to attending student performances
and sporting events. In addition, he has strengthened campus police and student relations.

On behalf of the senior class, I want to thank Sam for five years of service to the College. Although
the administration will soon begin a search for a new director, there is no replacement for Sam McKelvey.

Good luck Sam, and I hope you find an employer that appreciates your hard work.
