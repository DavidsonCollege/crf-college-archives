THE DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 24, 1924

Southern Lassies Ornament Campus With Their Beauty

The girls that encompassed the historic campus of Davidson the past week far eclipsed any such gathering that has ever
before graced her green lawns. The number is said to be larger than ever before and it is known for
a certainty that in looks and manners they have never been surpassed. From the far corners of the Southland they

New Officers Installed At “Y” Service
Special Program of Music by Speaking Visitors Was a Feature—Charge to New Officers

The “Y” vesper service last Sunday evening was given over to the installation of the officers for the coming year.
Ted Jones, the retiring president, took charge of the service and led the singing. There was a program of special
Easter music in which he was assisted by Miss Gibbon, Miss Gillis and Miss Hampton, of Queens College, and also
by the Davidson quartet. Mr. F. L. Jackson delivered a charge to the new officers. He said, “I am not
going to give you a charge, but I am going to hold before you some of the wonderful pictures as
found in the scripture. You may think of these and study them for yourselves.” First, he mentioned Abraham, whom he
described as a man of faith.Miss Edna Coble, Guilford College. Miss Grey Sellers, Henderson, N. C. Miss Virginia Sumner, Danville,
Va. Miss Mary Sims, Harrisburg, N. C. Miss Margaret Douglas, Mount Ulla, N. C. Miss Zella Martin, Maxton, N. C.
Miss Catherine Matthews, Washington, D. C. Miss Pauline White, Statesville, N. C. Miss Marguerite Richert, Highlands, N. C.

Miss the charge to the new “Y" Cabinet, said, “I do not wish to try to give a specific charge
to Mr. Jackson and Harry Price Make Talks cited as walking after God, before God, and with God. Then he
gave the example of Nehemiah as he labored and sacrificed in order to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem. Lastly, he
mentioned Peter and John going to the temple where they healed a man and did some personal evangelism. “God can
entrust great powers to those who can use it in little matters,” said Mr. Jackson. “These pictures from the scripture
will afford you serious reflection. The success of your work the coming year depends entirely on you.”

Mr. Jackson then read the charge both to the new cabinet and to the student body, to which each pledged
to be faithful. Harry Price, president for the coming year, said in beginning his address: “In behalf of the incoming
cabinet, I want to thank those who have gone before for the splendid work they have done. Let us think
tonight about a Davidson that can be if Jesus Christ is given a chance. Can He be with Christ here?
Certainly, it can be a place where nothing needs to be hidden. It can be a place where men will
order their lives as in an army, being loyal above all to their leader. And if Christ is here it
can be a place where each will have a definite purpose in life.”

Harry continued by quoting from Dr. Bruce Currie, who said, “God is looking for a campus where the men will
give themselves entirely to Christ. That campus has not yet been found.” In closing, Harry said that just as on
this day we celebrate the triumph of Christ over death, we should count it also as the beginning of a
new year in which Christ will triumph in the hearts of the men of Davidson.

PLAY FEATURES THIRD NIGHT
New Officers Selected By Actors and Gleemen
Martin Leads Dramatists, Patton Leads Gleemen, Selser to Manage Glee Club

A. M. (Piggy) Martin, of Savannah, Ga., was recently elected to the presidency of the Dramatic Club for the ensuing
year to fill the place now occupied by W. T. Jones. Piggy has been actively connected with the Dramatic Club
for the past three years, shining particularly as end-man and headline attractions on many occasions.

(Continued from page 1)

Following the performance of the Symphony Orchestra, the Dramatic Club presented a one-act play entitled The Ghost. It was a
drama depicting the utter lack of control of the young man’s faculties when the time comes that he must leave
his sweetheart, especially if he is desirous of carrying away with himself a promise of her someday being his for
all time. The role of the embarrassed young man was excellently played by Warren Cox. It would hardly seem that
Booth Tarkington, the author of the play, could have found a better character to represent the role of George than
did Cox. The part of Anna, the expectant sweetheart, was rendered exceptionally well by Miss Sara Lingle. Miss Lingle has
appeared in leading roles several times before the Davidson student body, and the choice of such a leading lady could
only have met with unanimous approval in her.

The nemesis of George seemed to lay in the continual presence of three couples who were always interfering with him
at a crucial moment. The personnel of these couples were played by Misses Mildred Cave, Charlotte Milstead, Mary Milly Ham,
all of Charlotte; and Dick McMillan, Dick Littlejohn, and Don Chipman, of Davidson. The plot of the story lay in
the visit of George to Anna on the night of his return to college. After some ten or fifteen minutes
of quarreling about the constant interruption of “the others,” George seemed about to arrive at the issue of the evening.
But at this moment, the three couples, the very “others” that George had been arraigning through the evening, arrived on
the scene. In an effort to arouse their fright, and thus get them home, George relates a ghost tale. But
instead of the three couples becoming frightened, it is Anna who goes almost into hysterics. Everyone leaves, even George, hoping
that she would recover, but in a few moments George returns to take up again the pursuance of his question.
As he is about to come to his point again, the second interruption occurs from the same source. But this
time, after the interruption is quelled, Anna does not wait for George to hesitate as to his proposal, but with
a smile and outstretched arms accepts him.

The Club presented the program which they had given once before at the college, as well as on their trip
of last fall. The playing of the jazz orchestra, the Dixieland Novelty Seven, was the hit of the evening. They
presented the new hits in their fullest glory, assisted by the voice of Watt McCain, who not only presided over
his traps but over the whole stage in his demonstration of Roaming Wild and Why, oh why did I kiss
those lips. The program consisted of chorus numbers, solos, quartet songs, and orchestra music. The evening was closed with the
singing of O Davidson by the entire Glee Club.

The Lowest Priced Two-Passenger Car

The Ford Runabout is the most economical car for personal transportation known. Priced lower than any other motor car, its
maintenance and running expenses are in keeping with its present low cost. To salesmen and others who average a high
daily mileage in business, the Runabout has a special appeal both for its operating economy and its convenience in making
city and urban calls.
