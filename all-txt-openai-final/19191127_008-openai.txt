8 THE DAVIDSONIAN, November 27, 1919

WILLIAM S. HART IS STAR AT STRAND NEXT FRIDAY

Featuring only carefully selected photoplays, the stars of which possess ability and very great popularity, and the largest and best orchestra in Charlotte, directed by Davie Lajoie. The Strand Theatre, under the management of Harry Somerville, continues to grow in popular favor at a highly pleasing rate. This theatre has become the Charlotte home of wholesome entertainment, where pictures that are really good but still have the thrills and heart appeal to ensure satisfied patrons.

Universal comedy, Universal “Screen Magazine,” “the reel of knowledge,” and the Hearst News, are parts of different programs. Another feature of The Strand is its $10,000 pipe-organ.

The picture to be presented next week, which probably will have the greatest appeal to the students of Davidson College, will be “Staking His Life,” with William S. Hart as the star. This play tells the story of a youth, brought up in the hard, stern west, who soon learned to play the game alone against a world of men. “I hate church folks, especially parsons,” was a threat of his that governed and darkened his whole life—yet finally it was a parson that staked his own life for his salvation. It is a gripping drama of love and hate, square dealing and straight shooting in the primitive western country. This picture will be shown Friday and Saturday, December 5 and 6.

Mr. P. LaDuke, Farmer, Says, “You Bet Rats Can Bite Through Metal.”

“I had feed bins lined with zinc last year, rats got through pretty soon. Was about to give up when a friend told me about RAT-SNAP. It surely kills rats, though house pets won’t touch it.” Rats dry up and leave no smell. Prices: 25¢, 50¢, $1.00. Sold and guaranteed by Moore Hardware Co. and White Drug Co.
