Military Unit Junior O. D. K. Members Newly Elected Officers Questioned

Awards of the Week at Last Drill

Lafferty Is Most Outstanding Senior; Stair Wins Junior Award

Various awards were presented to cadets at the Davidson R.O.T.C. unit’s final drill on Monday afternoon on Richardson Field. The Davidsonian asked the following questions: “Can you find any faults with the point system now under consideration by the Student Council? Is it too strict or too liberal? Can you suggest any changes in the arrangement of officers?”

Ted Parker, Sophomore:
I sincerely believe that the point system will be a necessary change at Davidson. Just as the publications, the athletic teams should be recognized. It seems the twenty-point classification should be inserted and managed.

Dick Spencer, Junior:
I think the point system in itself is all right, but the restrictions are too severe. The proposed point system in the thirty-point division should be lowered so as to allow them to hold several more offices. A person who is a real campus leader should be able to hold more offices than under the present point system. In my opinion, the other point divisions are all right.

Charlie Moore, Senior:
I'm all in favor of the point system. I think it's neither too strict nor too liberal, but a happy medium. In the five-point clause, a change should be made from Publication Board Manager to Publication Board Member. It's a fine system and in view of the fact that it would keep one man from getting too many offices and allow more men to take office, I'm in favor of it.

Dennis Vaughan, Sophomore:
The results and awards of the Rifle Competition were announced. Robert H. Hirst won the Gold Medal for high score, Walt S. won the Silver Medal, and Freshman William won the Bronze Medal.

Fielding Clark, Senior:
I think the point system is a good idea, but it needs some adjustments. There are many secondary offices that carry few responsibilities, and these should be considered differently than the major offices.

The cadets designated to receive these awards were Senior Cadet Lieut. Colonel Martin L. Lafferty and Junior Cadet First Serg. Fred Stair. Under authority of the Professor of Military Science and Tactics, they were designated Honor Students: Cadet Lieut. Colonel Martin L. Lafferty and Cadet Maj. Wm. M. Wicker. Rifle Medals of the Rifle Competition were awarded to Robert H. Hirst (Gold Medal), Walt S. (Silver Medal), and Freshman William (Bronze Medal).D hk (a; f; A 1 Colleg Rifle Team A ior Seer | Best Drilled Freshman 2 n 14 z 1} 1 Cenaty | ‘it \ | t (th; t atfair x Stu =} Fane: t OBSERVER PRINTING HOUSE ENG O;R'PORA TED School and College Printers Booklets - Catalogues - Engraving CHARLOTTE, N.
