Women’s b-ball suffers wrath of Marshall
By Bryan ALLISON
Staff writer

With a tough loss at Marshall last Monday night, the women’s basketball team finished the first half of its Southern Conference schedule winless. But as the team moves into the remainder of its schedule, it sees many positive signs that should point to better results in the future.

“What has been encouraging is that we’ve played everyone in the conference well,” coach John Filar says. “What’s frustrating is that we haven’t been able to get a win.”

The Marshall game was particularly disheartening for the Wildcats, as the Thundering Herd was missing several players to injuries. The Wildcats were led by Kristen Ferrucci, who had the best game of her Davidson career with 23 points and 11 rebounds. Monica Winter contributed 4 assists and 4 rebounds while shooting 3 for 4 from the field.

At the half, Davidson was down by 11 points. After falling down 14 with 16 minutes to go in the game, the Wildcats fought back to cut the lead to just four with eight minutes left before eventually losing 88-77. “It was an opportunity that we let slip away,” Filar says.

Wrestlers come home after weekend
By JOHN ROE

Last weekend, the Davidson wrestling team traveled to Atlanta for two days of intense wrestling against some of the best teams in the country. Saturday, the team went up against Duke and Georgia Tech and hoped to get in some matches against national powerhouse Ohio State, which is currently one of the top 20 teams in the nation. Sunday, the squad faced James Madison and Georgia State.

“This is the toughest wrestling we will see all year,” coach Tom Oddo says. “Georgia State will break the top twenty this season, but if not, they will certainly be in the polls by next year.”

Going up against teams of the caliber of Ohio State and Georgia State can only make the Wildcats better. Tough matches like these prepare the team for the most important part of the season: the Southern Conference tournament.

Davidson, however, is not healthy right now. “Half of the team is sick, and we have some borderline injuries,” Oddo says. Standout Jesse Kenner has an injured foot, the extent of which is still being determined. “There is a possibility of a fracture, but we will see how it feels this weekend and make a decision next week,” Oddo says.

The team will hopefully nurse itself back into shape for the tough competition.Ahead. A full and healthy lineup is essential for success in the conference tournament. This weekend, the Wildcats finally return home to wrestle Longwood and conference rival The Citadel. These conference matches are especially important because head-to-head competition records determine the seedings for the tournament. The wrestlers are looking for some strong support this season so they will be well on their way to a successful season’s end.

"We didn’t quite have the spark we had against ETSU and Georgia Southern, which was disappointing,” Filar says. “We are looking forward to the second half of the conference season.” The future looks brighter for Filar and the team with a strong recruiting class that Blue State Report ranked 20th in the nation. The schedule in the second half is much kinder to the Wildcats. Five of the seven remaining conference games are at home, including the next three. Davidson takes on Furman Wednesday night at 7:30 p.m. and Appalachian State Saturday at 7:30 p.m.
