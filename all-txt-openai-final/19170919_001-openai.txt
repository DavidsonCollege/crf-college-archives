All mail so addressed will reach him, being forwarded to his final destination. to Act as Instructor. All Freshmen and Sophomores will be required to drill three afternoons in the week, in uniform. Upperclassmen may elect Military Science, which has been combined with the course in Applied Mathematics 1. This is, inSubstance, the program for military training to be in force at Davidson for the coming year. Davidson has been fortunate in securing Captain Lea, who last year was the captain of cadets at the Citadel in Charleston, to act as Military Instructor. Captain Lea has arrived and will commence the drill as soon as practicable. The uniform, which must be worn by all Freshmen and Sophomores, will consist of shoes, trousers, leggings, shirt, and hat. The blouse may be bought, but the purchase of it is optional. The cord on the hat will probably be red and black. The uniform will be as near to that of the official United States uniform as the regulations will allow. The uniform will cost somewhere in the neighborhood of fourteen or fifteen dollars. The wearing of the uniform is compulsory only at the time of drilling, but it may be worn regularly, thus proving a saving in clothes. The drill during the fall will probably take place sometime in the morning hours. The schedule will be arranged this week. The course will begin with the school of the soldier, thence to squad, platoon, and company formations. For the upperclassmen, there has been arranged a course in Military Science which will be correlated with Applied Mathematics 1. Captain Lea and Prof. Wood will divide time with the class. Fieldwork in this course will include the regular fieldwork, and an addition of not more than three hours a week of fieldwork under the direction of Captain Lea.

THE BOOK LOVERS’ CLUB HAS ARRANGED PROGRAM

The Book Lovers’ Club of Davidson has issued a very attractively arranged program for the coming season, a copy of which The Davidsonian gratefully acknowledges. As usual, their work outlined is interesting and instructive. The particular subjects to be discussed this year are “The Ottoman Empire” and “Significant Effects of the World War.” The first meeting on the program was held on the 19th and was under the direction of Mrs. C. R. Richards and Mrs. I. M. Douglas. At this meeting, Miss Shaw gave a very interesting “Historical Sketch of the Ottoman Empire,” and Miss Julia Johnston very entertainingly discussed “England’s Protectorate.” The meeting to be held next Friday will be under the care of Mrs. C. I. Grey. At this meeting, Mrs. W. R. Grey will discuss “Mesopotamia,” and a large attendance of the membership is greatly desired.

No. 2 Fresh Reception Held Monday Night

Dr. Martin Makes Annual Address to the Students.

Every year the Y.M.C.A. holds a rally meeting of the students to reawaken the college spirit of the old men and arouse a feeling of loyalty on the part of the new men. This year the rally meeting was exceptionally full of “pep” and enthusiasm, not only on the part of the students, but the visitors joined heartily in the spirit of the occasion. The college orchestra was on hand and opened the meeting with several appropriate selections. Dr. Martin gave the address of welcome. He dwelt on the importance of keeping our minds and bodies clean in this training camp for future intellectual leaders of the world. We are traitors to ourselves, to our country, and to our God if we abuse our bodies. After Dr. Martin's address, Mr. Miller, president of the Alumni Association, made a few remarks. He was very optimistic about the outcome of the war. Immediately following Mr. Miller's talk, J. L. Fowle led the crowd in singing college songs. The rally spirit seemed to be contagious and everyone present joined enthusiastically in the singing. The songs were interspersed with college yells led by J. J. Love. The words of the songs and yells were thrown on the screen by a moving picture machine. After things became quiet, J. L. Fowle spoke on the college Y.M.C.A. work. He said the Y.M.C.A. is one of the few worldwide organizations that has remained intact. Mr. Fowle gave a general idea of the work to be carried on by the local Y.M.C.A. He spoke of the regular Y.M.C.A. meetings, the publication, the Mission Sunday Schools, and the revival meeting to be conducted by Rev. P. O. Wright. At the close of Mr. Fowle's speech, the orchestra gave several good selections. Coach W. M. Fetzer was given generous applause when he rose to speak. His subject was “College Athletics.” He said the first requisite of a good athlete is a clean life. Coach encouraged the new men to come out for football and also take part in other forms of athletics. The term “athletics” refers to any manly sport that benefits one. I. A. Thames followed Coach with a speech on the “Literary Societies.” Thames extended greetings and a cordial invitation to the new men to join the societies. The last speaker of the evening was G. C. Bellingrath, whose subject was “College Publications.” The speaker explained the purpose of the Handbook—a real handy book, of the Magazine, of The Davidsonian, and of the “Annual.” The exercises in Shearer Hall were closed by music rendered by the orchestra. The crowd then adjourned to the first floor of the new gymnasium for the Fresh Reception. The gymnasium room was very tastefully decorated with flowers, evergreens, pennants, and banners. The balcony posts were covered with ivy, while cedar and flowers were distributed in well-
