The editors of The Davidsonian have received considerable criticism from some of the students during the past week, not for
the stand it took with reference to the misconduct in church, but for taking a stand at all. They say
that the paper will be read by friends and alumni, who will lower their opinion of the college, and consequently
what was said will hurt Davidson more than it will help the cause.

The purpose of The Davidsonian is not to set forth only the glories and virtues of the college, and hide
that which is unlovely. The ideal of The Davidsonian is to be an expression of the best and truest spirit
that pervades the campus. If any action is shown that arouses the condemnation of this real spirit of Davidson, then
The Davidsonian must denounce that action. However, friends and alumni who read what was said last week will at least
see that the true spirit of the campus is opposed to such action.

Alumni and students will recall that the Davidson Song contest closes on the 15th of November. As yet not a
single contribution has been received. Davidson needs a "war-song." If not for the sake of a tennis racquet, then for
the sake of your Alma Mater, stir up your ingenuity, rejuvenate your creative and poetical powers, throw procrastination and modesty
to the winds, and compose a song. And, sir, you will receive more than a tennis racquet, you will have
the gratitude of students and alumni, and the knowledge that your efforts will carry Davidson on to victory. Try it.

**A Vote of Thanks**
The Davidsonian Staff, on behalf of the Student Body, wishes to take this method of thanking Mr. Stiles M. Brunson,
of Roanoke, Va., for his kindness in forwarding telegraphic accounts of the Davidson-Roanoke game, October 28th. Mr. Brunson is an
old Davidson man, and will soon go to New York to accept a position on the staff of a well-known
financial magazine.

**Y. M. C. A. Meeting**
The Y. M. C. A. meeting of last week was in the nature of a song service. Several members of
the orchestra gave instrumental selections which were greatly appreciated. The meeting was then given over to several speakers, who discussed
the problem of attendance at the Thursday night meetings from various viewpoints.

T. Henderson, '17, spoke first, stating as his opinion that as the students paid their Y. M. C. A. fee
in the Blanket Fee and not out of their own pockets, they did not have as much interest in the
organization.

W. C. Cumming, '18, gave as another reason for the poor attendance the fact that students made the speeches and
not men from other places. However, he upheld the student speakers and said that they had done faithful work.

J. K. Hobson, '17, and H. B. Fraser, '18, also gave short discussions.on the same subject. At the request of
the leader, Dr. Arbuckle made a short talk, stating that the college student becomes so taken up with other things
that he does not realize his need of religious things such as the Y. M. C. A. He said that
the Y. M. C. A. was the most helpful religious organization for the students in college. The meeting closed with
a selection by the orchestra and invocation.

LYCEUM ATTRACTION GIVEN SATURDAY NIGHT

On last Saturday night, in Shearer Hall, the second number in the Lyceum course being presented here this year was
given, this attraction being the Westminster Concert Entertainers. The entertainment was much above the usual standard, and was enjoyed by
all present. The personnel of the company was Miss Dorothy Cole, reader and pianist; Miss Iras Wilson, soprano, and Mr.
Larry Ball, Scotch songs and stories, but they displayed versatility and added variety to their program by being able to
do more than one thing well. Miss Cole’s recitations showed talent, and both her humorous and dramatic selections were well
received, while Miss Wilson delighted all with her solo work, especially her Japanese songs. Mr. Ball, dressed in the Scotch
costume, added an interesting feature with his humorous Scotch songs.

ANNUAL PHOTOGRAPHER ON HILL THIS WEEK

The photographer arrived Monday morning for the purpose of taking the pictures for this year's Annual. Most of the groups
and individual pictures have been taken. The individual pictures are being made in the Social Center, and all who have
not done so should have theirs made at once. The manager is doing his utmost to have all the pictures
made this fall so that the publishers will not be so rushed as has been the case in previous years.
There are a number of new clubs which have been organized since last year’s annual went to press, and these
will add to the appearance of the Year Book of 1919.
