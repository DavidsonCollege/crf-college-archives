**Anti-Americanism Abroad**

A JYA-Marburg student discusses how Germans feel about us

Thirty years ago, “going overseas” meant most likely heading off to Europe as a soldier in an occupying army that
was meant to deter the Soviets from attempting an invasion during those touchy “cold war” years. The American dollar was
worth four marks and the Americanization of Europe was in full swing. The days of late big band/early rock-and-roll and
the fashions and mentality to go along swept across Germany. The Americans were the saviors of Europe—preserving peace and freedom
by staving off the Soviets with grandiose military airlifts and by pumping large sums of money into the European, especially
the German economy.

However, in the past thirty years, things have changed. “Going overseas” is now analogous with traveling in Europe (Eurailing) or
doing some kind of Junior Year Abroad (JYA) program. American products are being marketed in larger numbers every year, American
fashions and fads become popular about a year or two after they are introduced here, and the European music industry
is dominated by the American and English recording concerns. Moreover, the label “American” has been transformed from something very good
into something very bad, representing a rise in anti-Americanism comparable to that in Germany after the entrance of the U.S.
into World War II.

The cause of this anti-U.S. sentiment is an overall insensitivity to European customs and mentality in our foreign policy and
our very possessive attitude toward Western Europe. The German students, who love to have a cause and are never unified
on any topic, have found a universal cause and are unifying behind anti-Americanism. America is seen by the Germans as
a power exerting influence on Western Europe much like the Soviets do in their Eastern Bloc countries. The U.S. has
Army-Air Force exercises at will and moves troops and armaments for both offensive and defensive types of war. The U.S.
can also force deployment of weapons like the controversial medium-range nuclear warhead rockets and the neutron bomb in Europe, thus
restricting the brunt of a tactical war in Europe, as the Soviets would like to use Eastern Europe. Most importantly,
it is hard for Europeans to distinguish between the role of the U.S. in NATO and the role of the
U.S.S.R. in the Warsaw Pact.

The scars of war are evident everywhere in Germany. As a student in Marburg, I found bomb craters in the
woods by the jogging path, bombed-out churches left as memorials in large cities, scars of machine-gun bullets and shrapnel in
old church walls, bombed-out bridge abutments along major rivers such as those at Remagen-on-the-Rhine, and most importantly, candid descriptions of
air raids, military engagements, and fleeing from the East leaving home, family, and friends beloved, from the victims of WWII,
the people who lived through it. War is not easy to forget, and German students, none of whom have experienced
it, are not willing to see their land destroyed again by a war for which they are not responsible.

Another disturbing reality is the increased U.S. involvement in the support of right-wing regimes in Southeast Asia, Africa, the Middle
East, and South and Central America against any kind of leftist movement. While our papers and newscasts talk about guerilla
warfare in Afghanistan, so does the German media. However, they also talk about Chile, Argentina, El Salvador, and the rest
of the U.S. sphere of influence, revealing how unjustified direct U.S. movement often is in these countries.

I then found myself trying to defend the U.S. position in each of these instances and justify the intense U.S.
involvement in Europe, all of which I knew very little about last year at this time. Many times I took
these attacks of anti-Americanism personally, which was very difficult when they came from friends. Often the sentiment was spontaneous, resulting
from a radio, TV, or newspaper report, or other times the students seemed to have thought out their arguments quite
thoroughly, as was the case with a Socialist couple who lived two doors down from me. I was, however, almost
universally able to take solace in the fact that whatever the U.S. had done, the Soviets had done something worse,
a weak but often convincing argument. After each confrontation passed, and discussion turned to social matters or stopped completely, I
thoroughly considered the implications of the opposing argument and have pieced together my own ideas about U.S. involvement in world
affairs, as I could look out my window and imagine what Marburg was like during WWII and what it would
be like if WWIII ever came.

It is not necessary to travel in Europe...to experience anti-Americanism, nor is it necessary to go to Europe to become
more sensitive about these issues. One can at least become more informed about U.S. involvement in other countries and form
an opinion, which can lead to a better understanding of our foreign policy, and some much-needed criticism of that foreign
policy from within this country. John Hoots is a senior chemistry major from Winston-Salem. John spent last year in Marburg,
West Germany with the JYA program.

When I walked across that plywood stage last May to accept my diploma I was a very happy man. All
those years of educational irrelevance were over. No more ridiculous Humanities reviews, no more academic parochialism (“We don’t hire Marxist
economists here”) and no more slide shows of Mark Twain’s linen suit collection. I was finally out from under Davidson’s
shelter and was ready to face The Real World.

The Real World, for the uninitiated, is a place which has been discussed in certain op-ed articles in this newspaper
in recent years, ones that have lamented Davidson’s otherworldliness. It is in The Real World where hard decisions are made.
It is in The Real World where things matter. It is a place where Adam Smith the political economist is
revered but where Adam Smith the moral philosopher is unheard of. It is where men are men and women are
not. Queer, where there are no extensions on overdue work, and where you can’t just punt and go skiing for
a few days. And, so the theory goes, it is a place for which one must be prepared, a job
that, well, Davidson doesn’t do.

So I set out, Strunk and White in hand, for my first Real World battleground, a summer internship with the
Atlanta Constitution. There I knew I would find people who were doing practical work, meaningful work. People who affected events
and never cared what Mark Twain wore. I was not to be disappointed. I covered municipal strikes and city hall
news conferences. Fires, drought, and one double murder. I spent a day staking out the house of Wayne Williams, who
has since been accused of the murders of two of Atlanta’s missing children. I interviewed a woman the day after
her husband, a Canadian hydrofoil racer, had fallen overboard and had been decapitated by his engine propeller (“So tell me,
Mrs. Rabinowitz, how did you feel yesterday when you saw your husband...”). All this in the first two weeks of
June.

This was all very exciting. I found an immediacy and a tension in reporting that I had not found in
Leibnitz, Pope, and Emerson. I was sure that while man in the 20th century could get along quite well without
knowing about the latest Parisian intellectual spat, he would have a harder time living without daily political and economic information.
Of this I was certain until I began receiving assignments that required a greater degree of analysis and a respect
for subtlety. After interviewing several state officials about proposals for penal reform in Georgia, I realized that their positions often
developed not out of any serious reflection but out of their visceral conception of human nature. One group argued for
an end to parole, for mandatory sentences, and for a corresponding restriction of judicial discretion in sentencing. The other group
called for a greater emphasis on rehabilitation and an expansion of parole. The first group felt that even if human
behavior could be modified, it was not the state’s business to do so. The second argued that not only could
criminal behavior be modified, but that it was socially imperative to begin immediately.

The disagreement, I finally recognized, focused not on restructuring a bureaucracy but on the nature of man. One side saw
a virtuous humanity protecting itself from outlaws while the other saw a decadent society turning its back on the flawed
individuals it had created. John Locke, B.F. Skinner, William Shakespeare, and all those other unworldly types suddenly seemed very relevant.
While academic parochialism and trivia masquerading as scholarship remain as problems to be dealt with, the strength of Davidson’s educational
program continues to lie in its emphasis on analyzing problems in depth, in pushing to see through the clutter of
politics and prejudice into the nature of timeless questions. In this sense Davidson is The Real World, as the social
and moral issues we face are brought into greater focus in isolation. This, perhaps, is an argument that appeals only
to the already convinced, but in the past four years my eyes have been opened a little wider and for
this I am grateful.

Donald Caldwell graduated from Davidson in May 1981.
