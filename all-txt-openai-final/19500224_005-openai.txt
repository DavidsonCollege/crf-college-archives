This Saturday, Chapel Hill will be the scene for the largest track affair in these parts — the Southern Conference Indoor Games. More entries (over five hundred) have been made in this, the fifteenth annual meeting, than ever before. As usual, there will be four divisions of competition — conference, non-conference, freshman, and high school. Host University of North Carolina will be favored to retain the conference title which they won last year. Although they have had no suitable place inside to work out, three boys will be wearing the Red and Black of Davidson. They are Roger Cornell, Bill Pritchett, and Bill White. Cornell, a high jumper, aims to go above the six feet he has cleared in practice. Hurdlers Pritchett and White have been working hard, but they will see about the fastest competition in their field. Olympic star Bill Albans of UNC will try to equal his last year’s feats of breaking records in the low and high hurdles. Albans will also be a man Cornell must beat in the high jump. Only last week, Bob Morrow, another UNC star, broke a couple of hurdles records up at Maryland. Coach Pete Whittle isn't too optimistic for his boys because of the very keenness of the competition, but he feels that this will be very good experience for them. We wish the best for these three who are really competing in the big time.

Cats Fail To Take

By WOODY McKAY

Roaring back after halftime to score 51 points, Richmond showed that they could really play basketball when they put their mind to it. They downed the Wildcats, 81-60, in a fast-scoring game. Using a tight zone defense, the Spiders of Richmond forced Davidson to take long shots instead of permitting them to filter in under the basket. However, the Wildcats didn’t make it easy for them. The first half was a good battle, and the Spiders had a meager five-point lead, 35-30, when the first half was over. The first eight minutes of the second half was the deciding part of the game when Richmond stripped the nets for 26 points and kept a lead of seven points or more for the remainder of the ball game. Davidson's work in getting rebounds was not up to par, and Richmond took advantage of the backboards and had control of the game.

Lanky Chris Whiteman of the Phi Gams took scoring honors for the night.

Pi Kaps 44; SPE 41

In a hard-fought tilt, the Pi Kaps edged the SPE five to the tune of 44-41. The lead changed hands several times, but the Pi Kaps sewed up the game with two quick field goals in the last few minutes. The SPE’s diminutive guard, Jim Miller, and Rawson of the Pi Kaps, each managed 13 points.

Maryland Quintet Tops Davidson 64-61
By BILL FARRIAR

The University of Maryland eked out a three-point margin to edge the Wildcats in a nip and tuck Southern Conference contest, 64-61. After leading most of the game, but never by more than eight points, the Terps finally managed to go ahead to stay with nine minutes left in the game. At this point, they began to freeze the ball and took only a few cautious shots as they put the game on ice. Bill Brooks was the big gun for the Wildcats, with 15 points while Lee Brawley and Lee Smith of the Terps managed to get 17 each.

The highlights of the weekend turned out disastrous for the Davidson wrestlers, as VPI turned back the fast-learning Davidson team by 15-9. There were no pins during the entire affair; VPI decisioned five and Davidson decisioned three. Little Johnny Kelton won his match, and with Hanes and Alexander, earned the Davidson points. Cromelon, Grissom, Covelle, and McNeely all lost by decisions. One of the brighter points of the battle was the match between McNeely and Wachter of VPI. Wachter got a guillotine hold on McNeely, but McNeely kept Wachter from pinning him. The VPI coach commented that it was the first time that Wachter had failed to pin a man when he got a guillotine hold. The final decision was 2-0 in favor of Wachter. A large gallery of fans watched the bruising struggles.

DAVIDSON POINTING... (Continued From Page 4)

At present, the Wildcats own a 9-10 won-loss record and a 10-16 mark would be nothing to be ashamed of in the year of building. Baird will, in all probability, start his regular outfit of Bill Brooks and Tommy Haller at forwards, Don Lazenby at center, and Cobb and Dutch Hengeveld at guards.

Wes Brown was the outstanding player all night. Stephenson, collecting 1, and “Dutch” Hengeveld again proved his set shot skills by sinking six shots for twelve points. Haller and Brooks with ten apiece. Although no shot chart account has been published for this game, spectators estimated that the Spiders hit for an amazingly high average, possibly near 50 percent. It was one of the best exhibitions of shooting seen there in many moons.
