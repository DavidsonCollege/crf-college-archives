**Clowns Cut Up on Campus**

They call themselves Bounce the Clown, Flip, and Cyrus P. Koski III.

Together they comprise the Loco-Motion Circus—a knockout blend of acrobatics and comedy.

They would rather be known as Bounce, Flip, and Cyrus than whatever their real names are, but in any case,
they have been touring the country in two vans, bringing their act to colleges, to the Mardi Gras, and to
the summer Olympics in Montreal two years ago, where they appeared on ABC’s “Wide World of Sports.”

Armed with a few standard circus props: unicycles, juggling pins, hats, fake moustaches, cigar boxes, and an oversized hammer, the
three entertainers never fail to captivate audiences with their mime sketches, magic, acrobatics, and the “Accordion Accompaniment to the Juggling
of Flaming Torches, Balls, and Boxes.”

Bounce and Cyrus have been together for three years, ever since they met at the University of Massachusetts, where they
studied acrobatics and gymnastics. Bounce says, “We just started juggling and the whole thing sort of evolved.” (Come on, all
you Davidson jugglers, we're waiting!)

Flip, the newest member of the group, is a stuntman and former Ringling Bros. and Barnum and Bailey’s Circus Clown.
His style is reminiscent of Chaplin’s visual slapstick combined with acrobatic stunts.

Together the three present a varied demonstration of strength, agility, and visual and verbal humor. They also can present educational
programs and workshops in the circus arts and acrobatics.

The Loco-Motion Circus will be on campus Friday, October 13, in front of Chambers in the afternoon and in the
900 Room at 10:30 pm. (50 cents).

**Llords Will Bring His “Stringed Creatures” to Campus Next Thursday**

**Llord of the Strings Featured**

A one-man show with a cast of nine hundred will be featured in Love Auditorium next Thursday. Yes, that’s right,
a cast of nine hundred. Daniel Llords, solo marionettist, will bring LLORDS’ “INTERNATIONAL” (Music and Marionettes for Adults) to campus
as part of his fifth world-wide concert.

Llords is a native-born American musician and actor who, according to a press release, “discarding a juvenile career, has created
an art, full of ingenious sound and scenic fury for adults.”

Llords made his professional debut at age seven playing a Mozart piano concerto as guest soloist with a symphony. After
careers in acting, singing on radio, and working as a theatrical designer, he concentrated on his first love, the nine
hundred marionettes that he has single-handedly made and which constitute the “full strength of the company” of LLORDS’ “INTERNATIONAL.”

Now, as solo marionettist, he frequently appears as guest artist with leading symphony orchestras, having traded the piano keyboard for
the equally demanding but highly unusual controls of the marionette to interpret visually great masterworks such as Stravinsky's “Firebird” and
the “Capriccio Espagnol” of Rimsky-Korsakov. In the hands of a virtuoso, the marionette takes its place on the concert stage
as a new stringed instrument in company with the more traditional cello, violin, or harp.

Daniel Llords will appear in Love Auditorium on November 19 at 8:15 pm. Tickets will go on sale Monday at
the Union Desk; $1 for students, $3 for non-students.
