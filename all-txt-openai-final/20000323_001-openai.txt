**College hauled to court**

By Michael J. Kruse
Editor Emeritus

Davidson is fighting for its way of life in a court of law.

Junior John Powell and his parents filed a lawsuit against the college last November after a pair of late-night scuffles
on Oct. 14 led to Code of Responsibility sanctions.

The Powells are charging Davidson with improper application of its own Code, bias due to a previous incident, and overly
severe sanctions — in the words of the Powells’ attorneys, the failure “to provide a fair and impartial judicial and
review mechanism.”

A Judicial Committee chaired by Associate Dean of Students Leslie Marsicano levied four sanctions following a hearing on Oct. 21
— suspension for the remainder of the fall semester, social probation this spring, required alcohol and anger management counseling, and
restitution for any medical costs resulting from the incidents.

Powell has or is currently in the process of satisfying all sanctions — all of them, that is, except the
suspension.

The Powells’ attorneys, Lynwood P. Evans and John M. Martin based in the family’s hometown of Greenville, N.C., fought for
a temporary restraining order — and got one from Superior Court Judge Clifton W. Everett of Pitt County — allowing
Powell to remain on campus and in class through the end of last semester.

“I don’t want to see other people get stepped on by a system that’s not fair.”

Davidson’s administrators and attorneys are trying to uphold that system.

“We fight this because this is the Honor Code and Code of Responsibility,” Dean of Students Tom Shandley said in
his office last week. “It’s absolutely essential to what this institution is about.”

At stake at this point are Powell’s grades from the fall. He wants them. Davidson has them and will not
release them.

For both sides, though, there’s also the matter of principle.

“I’m sure there are people out there that think what I’m doing isn’t the right thing, that I’m attacking the
institution,” Powell said in a recent interview. “But this isn’t just for me.

“To have a court come into what is typically a college-run procedure and somehow instruct us how we should run
our disciplinary procedures would be a huge change in precedent.”

The current legal battle stems from two separate physical altercations in and outside the Kappa Alpha fraternity house on Patterson
Court in the wee hours of Oct. 14.

According to police reports, witness statements, and court documents obtained by The Davidsonian, Powell broke senior Robert Lindenberg’s ankle by
pushing him to the floor at approximately 2:00 a.m. Some 90 minutes later Powell joined sophomore Nick Grainger in a
fight against sophomore Schuyler Hoffman.

Neither Lindenberg nor Hoffman pressed charges, although Hoffman filed a police report shortly after 4:30 that morning.

Powell contacted both Lindenberg and Hoffman the next day and offered to pay for Lindenberg’s medical expenses.

“Don’t worry about compensating me more,” Lindenberg wrote in an Oct. 25 e-mail to Powell. “This will help enough. Anyways,
I hope you work out your sanctions with the school and I will see you around soon.”

“He’s friendly,” Lindenberg said of Powell when contacted last week. “I don’t enjoy talking to him. But it’s not a
big deal.”
