**Our friends, our war**

It seems like we’ve been at war since that September morning. In many ways, we have. Now, though, with over 100,000 American troops either stationed in or heading towards the Middle East—not to mention Colin Powell taking twice-weekly field trips to U.N. headquarters—we really are on the brink of Something Big.

Having lived through this war already, our reaction to current and coming events is a good measuring stick for the Millennials’ growth. A decade ago, we colored paper American flags with Crayola nubs. News footage of neon green smart bombs flashing on an otherwise black screen smacked more of early Nintendo than national interest. Today, our friends are our countrymen. A decade ago, we stood at attention in school assemblies while Lee Greenwood’s anthem of unity blasted through the gym. Tonight, we’ll divide the Union Atrium along insurmountable ideological and political lines. This debate, though, is just a piece of the discourse that is taking place at dinner tables and in dorm rooms. We’ll take informed discussion over third-grade warbling any day, but our political improvement is bittersweet. We’ve grown up, and our world has changed.

This time, our friends are going to fight. Our siblings are being shipped out. Other friends, other siblings are protesting. Protesting is important. Fighting is important. Debating is important. But this war is well past the public opinion polling phase. A substantial military commitment has been made and, barring a show of diplomatic dexterity thus far not exhibited by the current administration, some serious muscle flexing is going to happen. Bottom line: people are going to die. Now it’s a matter of how many, who and how.

Our perception of “what is possible” was shattered by one plane—then two—then three—then four. Our imaginations ran away then, but it was too much too late. On the eve of Gulf War II, think about what four planes in four American aircraft carriers would look like. Now imagine there are eight.

Granted, over-imagination leads to unhealthy if not wholly unwarranted fear. But fear is not to be embraced. If you want to fight, fight bravely and with your country’s support. If you want to protest, protest eloquently and effectively. Just do something.

“War is my last choice,” said President Bush on Tuesday. “But the risk of doing nothing is even a worse option.” Of course, if war is hell, it’s hard to say what a worse option looks like.

**Strong words should not be used lightly**

Unfortunately, the choice of vocabulary used to describe the golf swing heard ’round the world in last week’s Davidsonian was more noteworthy than the subject matter discussed. President Vagt called the act “repugnant” and “senseless.” Dean Shandley added “despicable” to the mix. However, the winners in the over-dramatization sweepstakes were the editors at the Davidsonian, pulling out “reprehensible,” “incomprehensible,” and my favorite phrase, “when the unimaginable happens...”

Administrators, the editorial staff, and other students are free to denounce last week’s incident in as strong terms as they like. Perhaps a few fraternity pledges killing a goose is repugnant, despicable, and unimaginable to some. I would call it stupid, immature, and even shameful. The difference between the first set of descriptions and the latter is significant, though. College students often do dumb, shameful things; it is part of the physical and emotional growth we all go through. Killing a bird would fit into this category. But repugnant? Incomprehensible? These types of words are best reserved for truly serious crimes and violence. Murder and rape are “reprehensible” acts. The killings at Columbine High School in 1999 were “senseless.” The attacks of September 11 qualify as “the unimaginable.” Using these same words to describe a fraternity stunt gone awry blurs the line between truly repugnant, immoral behavior and simple immaturity. As such, it does a disservice not only to the...Students implicated in this case, but also to those who have actually witnessed and persevered through genuinely horrible circumstances. In my four years here, one lesson I have learned is that words mean things. Perhaps in the future, administrators and the Davidsonian’s editors should heed this advice, lest they run out of adjectives to choose from should the truly unimaginable happen.

“Monologues” take wrong angle on abuse

The purpose of “The Vagina Monologues” is wonderful: to condemn and respond to violence against women and to foster positive views and feelings about female sexuality. But audiences and participants have ignored some serious problems in the past with the means by which the production tries to reach this end.

One main problem in the 2001 production I saw involved the skit “The Little Cootchi Snorcher That Could.” In this scene, a young girl has had only very bad experiences with her vagina, culminating in her being raped at age 10 by one of her father’s friends. When she is 13 years old, a 24-year-old woman seduces her. After describing the encounter and subsequent sexual relationship in detail, the female speaker says that this woman “transformed my sorry-ass Coochi Snorcher and raised it into a kind of heaven.” But the girl’s “politically-incorrect salvation” was not just politically incorrect. The scene glorified and romanticized sexual abuse. It also revealed the horrible double standards of sexual abuse, relevant to the one that leads to the neglect of millions of cases of sexual violations of males. Since this was sexual abuse in a female, homosexual context, it was seen as a kind of coming-of-age experience. Had a 24-year-old man molested a 13-year-old girl in this scene, people would react with outrage.

The somewhat radical Wendy McElroy pointed out in an online editorial I read that by legal and feminist standards, this “seduction” was rape. (According to McElroy, a couple of years ago, the scene also included the phrase “If it was rape, it was good rape.” The 2001 script omitted this line). Although I didn’t go to this year’s production, mainly because of the 2001 production, in the 2003 script the girl is now 16 when the 24-year-old woman seduces her. McElroy says that in 2001 Ensler explained away the changes by saying that the monologues are “an ever-evolving process.” She says this was the only scene changed, although now other elements have also been added on.

Inherent in this story and others in the “Monologues” is the assumption that physical pleasure can heal one of the effects of sexual molestation and violence. Often, victims of sexual abuse engage in unhealthy and harmful sexual behavior as a result of what has happened to them. An example is promiscuity. Such behavior, not truly a part of who they are, usually does not help them find what they have lost but instead wreaks more pain. In this case, a woman’s sexuality is formed by the harms done to her rather than as a choice or outgrowth of her identity. Sexual abuse and assault victims instead need to receive help and healing for the violence that has tampered with their bodies, hearts, and sexuality in order to fully enjoy the pleasures of consensual sex. The idea that mere physical pleasure will erase pain and violence is a confusing myth. The real story was positive from the point of view of the real victim, but that doesn’t make it positive: it was still abuse. Even with the age changes and line omissions, the story’s ingredients are similar to cases of molestation, and thus the skit still somewhat glorifies assault and denies the pain of less traditionally recognized victims of abuse.

I don’t think this was publicly brought up at Davidson in reaction to previous productions. Regardless of the changes, the public needs to take a more thorough and critical look at problematic elements in “The Vagina Monologues.”
