Last weekend at the Southern Conference Championship track and field meet, a Davidson runner stood atop the podium as conference
champion for the first time in ten years. In blistering heat that caused significantly slower times than usual, senior Dan
Gibson became the first Wildcat since 1992 to capture a conference title as he ran away from the competition last
Saturday in the 1500-meter run. Gibson’s time of 3:54.44 carried him across the finish line in first place, more than
a second in front of the next runner, despite being five seconds slower than his own fastest time of the
season.

An hour later, Gibson scored once again as he earned second place in the 800-meter run behind Western Carolina’s Caleb
Bailey, who had finished second to Gibson in the 1500-meter. It was the first time that Gibson had competed in
the open 800-meter this year and his time of 1:54.58 was only half a second behind the winner. By placing
in the top three, Gibson was named a member of the All Conference team.

Senior runner Jay Jahnes turned in another outstanding performance last weekend. Jahnes’ times have improved consistently throughout the season and
he was rewarded on Saturday with a fourth place finish in the 800-meter run and a sixth place finish in
the 1500-meter run. Jahnes finished the 800-meter in a time of 1:56.21, over two seconds faster than what his previous
season’s best had been. He also shaved four seconds from his 1500-meter time to earn sixth place in 3:59.52.

Head coach Gary Andrews praised both Gibson’s and Jahnes’ contributions to the team. “We scored the second highest total amount
of points ever for Davidson,” he said. “A lot of that had to do with our senior leadership coming through
in a big way and scoring the majority of our points.”

Gibson leads the track pack with 1st, 2nd place

Other point scorers for the Wildcats were senior co-captain Greg Schernecke and freshman John Leverett. Schernecke finished the 400-meter hurdles
in a time of 57.31 seconds, fast enough to earn him sixth place. In the long jump, Leverett leaped a
season’s best distance of 6.76 meters, adding over half a meter to what had previously been his farthest jump. The
leap carried the freshman into the finals and into an eighth place finish for Davidson.

Elsewhere on the track, the Wildcats struggled against the oppressive heat. Nowhere was this more obvious than in the 5000-meter
run, in which the competitors were hosed down with water as they rounded the first curve of the track. Junior
Jimmy Swansbrough was Davidson’s first finisher in the event as he crossed the line in 16:20.10. Junior Ben Gaspar followed
him in 16:29.36. The 400-meter runners earned season’s bests as both Chris Rouisse and Randall Hardy improved their previous times.
Rouisse had the fastest time of the day with 52.59, with Hardy finishing in 53.84.

Overall, Davidson placed seventh out of ten teams, totaling 31 points in the competition. Appalachian State swept both the men’s
and women’s titles, winning the men’s championship with a tally of 224 points. The championship was a great ending for
what has been an outstanding year for men’s track and field. “We had good performances from a lot of guys
this weekend and a lot of personal records,” said Andrews.

The season isn’t over yet for the Wildcats. The 4x800-meter relay team of Dan Gibson, Jay Jahnes, Greg Scott, and
Jimmy Swansbrough will travel next weekend to Philadelphia to compete in the prestigious Penn Relays, one of the largest meets
in the country. Gibson will also be competing individually in the upcoming IC4A Regional Championships in Princeton, NJ.

Women’s track falters in Tenn., finishes with four points

JOHNSON CITY, TN—The sun blazed in the Tennessee sky and made for tough running weather this past weekend on East
Tennessee State’s Liberty Bell track. The Wildcat women’s track and field team could not capitalize in this humid weather and
ended its season with a tenth place finish at the Southern Conference Championships. The Appalachian State Mountaineers won the championship
meet with an astounding 216 points, while Western Carolina and Georgia Southern rounded out the top three in team competition.

The Davidson women garnered four points throughout the course of the weekend. These four points came from seventh-place finishes in
both the 4x100- and 4x400-meter relay events, both of which were season-best performances. The 4x100 relay team consisted of Jana
Yee ’03, Amanda Yeck ’04, Kate Wilson ’04, and Jenny DiCosmo ’03 while the 4x400 team was composed of Yeck,
Yee, Wilson, and Clarissa Carr ’05. The mid-distance corps performed well.

McKillop no longer a candidate for Richmond job, despite reports

The University of Richmond was expected to name Jerry Wainwright as its new headBasketball coach on Wednesday, ending speculation that
Davidson’s Bob McKillop might interview for the job. ESPN.com’s Andy Katz reported on Tuesday night that Wainwright, head coach at
UNC Wilmington for the past seven seasons, will be introduced as head coach six days after John Beilein left the
school to take over the West Virginia program. An article in Tuesday’s Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that Spiders athletic director Jim
Miller had narrowed his top two choices to Wainwright and McKillop, with UNC Greensboro’s Fran McCaffery also receiving consideration. Reached
late Tuesday night in New York, where he has been recruiting since Friday, McKillop said he hadn’t spoken with anyone
at Richmond. “I’ve heard all kinds of rumors that I’m supposedly on their list,” he said. “I did not speak
to anybody at Richmond. Interesting how rumors start.” After leading the Wildcats to the NCAA Tournament this season for the
second time in his career, McKillop said his focus remains on improving the Davidson program. Seeded No. 13 in the
West Region, the Wildcats nearly shocked No. 4 Ohio State in the first round but lost 69-64. “I think I’m
in this mentality that I want to take Davidson to the next step. That’s my goal right now. The way
we played (in the NCAA Tournament) let us know how close we are.” Athletic directors normally ask for permission before
speaking to another school’s coach, but Davidson A.D. Jim Murphy said on Tuesday afternoon that he had not been contacted
by anyone at Richmond. Murphy said he had also read reports naming McKillop as a possible candidate. “It just reiterates
what we already know: that we have great coaches in our program,” said Murphy. “I’d be surprised if they didn’t
(contact us).” If McKillop were interested, Murphy said he would have granted permission for an interview. “My position is that
it’s Davidson’s job to prepare coaches to meet their career goals,” he said. “If it were a better job, I’d
tell them they ought to take it. If it’s not a better job, and most wouldn’t be, I’d tell them
that too.” Asked if the Richmond position qualified as a better job, Murphy said, “At first glance, I would say
no. (But) only the individual can judge.” McKillop, 51, has coached Davidson for 13 seasons since 1989, compiling a 205-171
record over that span. He has drawn interest from bigger schools in recent years and was a finalist at St.
John’s before Mike Jarvis received the job in 1998. But on Tuesday night, the coach said he doesn’t spend time
worrying about other schools. “I’ve been working the recruiting trails aggressively,” he said. “If I start spinning my wheels about
stuff like that, I’d never get the job done at Davidson.”

Despite the temperatures, in the 1500-meter run, freshmen Anna Brew and Lindley Swartz led the ’Cats with two of their
best times this season, 5:01.97 and 5:02.03, respectively. Close behind the freshmen were Liz Gross ’03 in 5:05.26 and Jenna
Kruppa ’04 in 5:08.99. The meet was Kruppa’s first race back after an injury. Notably, Amanda Yeck completed her first
heptathlon for the Wildcats. This female-only event challenged athletes with the shot put, long jump, high jump, and javelin field
events in addition to the 100-meter hurdles, 200-meter dash, and 800-meter run. Davidson’s versatile sophomore accumulated 3,346 points over the
course of two days. Co-captain Gross felt pleased about the weekend’s performance. She said, “It was a good end to
the season because many of our people had season bests even though it was a difficult meet and very hot.”
Gross spoke highly of coaches Jenn Straub and Adam Johnson. “Jenn’s been a great coach and is starting to push
us more than the years before,” she said, “And the team loves it and responds well. Adam’s already talking about
next year.”
