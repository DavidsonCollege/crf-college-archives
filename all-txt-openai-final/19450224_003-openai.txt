Every year about this time, the eight best teams in the Southern Conference play in a tournament at Raleigh. This year the South Carolina Gamecocks were rated in first place, for they have won nine consecutive games. This is one of the best records a team has had in many years. The Blue Devils of Duke, defending champions, were selected second; North Carolina third; and Citadel fourth. The other teams selected in this championship tourney, based on their loop records, were Clemson, N.C. State, William and Mary, and Maryland. It was thought that Davidson might go, but something beyond our control prevented that.

By FRITZ KEESLER

Tournament officials said that the University of Richmond, which came out in second place, let it be known that they would be unable to accept an invitation to the tournament because of an epidemic of mumps. This is too bad (for South Carolina) for the Spiders have a good team. Many fans think that South Carolina will win the tourney. However, North Carolina has a fine team on the floor. Last year Duke beat North Carolina in the finals, but this year we hope that they will beat Duke in any game.

Wildcats

This past week the Wildcats won two conference games. They beat both Furman and Clemson, and in these games the team looked better than it has for weeks. Coach Shepard’s boys used a zone defense, which seemed to have taken the other teams by surprise and worked very smoothly. However, the offense also looked very excellent. The Cats have about four or five more games to play this season, and let’s hope they can win them all, for we all will be out fighting too.

Intramurals

Fraternity basketball is now moving at full speed. At the present time the Betas seem to be on top, for they have lost but one game. There have been some good games while others have been rough, with poor ball being played. There is a great interest in these games, and the boys try their hearts out for their dear ole Fraternity. Some of the games have gotten pretty rough, and I have expected several to end in a fight, but so far none have. Dumbo seems to be one of the roughest ones, for he likes football better. Little Lingeberger is one of the best Fraternity players around. He is a good shot and is as fast as greased lightning. The Betas are out on top, but both the S.P.E.’s and the Independents are looking good. The Pika-Pi Kapps are gradually gaining momentum as the season rolls by. They played a very interesting and rough game with Kappa Sigs and show excellent promise for the future.

Spring Sports

Spring is not too far off and with spring comes baseball. Last year the Davidson baseball team did not have much luck. They won only one game, and it is not known for sure whether they will have a team this year or not. If there is a team it probably won’t be very good, but it will be fun for those who try to play.

Also with spring comes tennis and golf. There is some talk of a tennis team. I have heard a lot of boys talking about playing tennis, but you can’t tell how good they are until you see them play. Maybe there are some good players around here, and if there are, let the coach know. If there is enough interest maybe there will be a team. Let’s hope so, for it’s a fine game.

There will probably be no golf team this year. However, Phil Whitter says that he is going to play in the 10,000 Charlotte Open in March. Let's wish him luck against some of the big boys.
