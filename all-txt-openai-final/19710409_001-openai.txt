**Freshman Financial Aid Not To Meet Total Need**

By RICH WILSON
Managing Editor

Director of Admissions and Financial Aid H. Edmunds White revealed this week that Davidson College will no longer be able to meet the financial needs of all the incoming freshmen. “We will continue to offer aid equal to the need of the great majority of our students; however, in the case of some accepted applicants, the college does not have the financial resources to meet their total need,” said White. “In such cases, we shall offer some loan and work-study aid,” he said. “But in order for the student to enroll, he and his family will have to rely on other resources to supplement the college’s award.” White noted that the college has run out of scholarship money; consequently, scholarships, loans, and jobs will be distributed competitively on the basis of overall qualifications of the applicants. White also said that much of the financial...

**Housing Lottery Delayed By Administration Order**

By ROBERT TOUCHTON
Asst. Managing Editor

Director of Student Housing Scottie Nicholls says she is falling further behind in her yearly tasks every day because the administration is delaying authorizing the selection of students to live off-campus next year. Over the years, Nicholls developed what she thinks is the most efficient way of doing her work, and every day the room drawing is not held, that plan is delayed longer and her problems are compounded. As a result of an order from Vice President for Academic Affairs, Dr. John M. Bevan, the drawing was postponed from the original plan for this week. To avoid trouble and mix-ups after the drawings, Nicholls delayed the lottery until permissions for off-campus living have been granted. “Otherwise, we might have people switching roommates and changing their plans,” Nicholls said, and that would further complicate the process. Nicholls and Dean of Students Will H. Terry are responsible for reviewing and granting requests for permission to live off-campus during the senior year. When asked why she felt there was a delay this year, Nicholls said that undoubtedly the main problem was money. The administration wants to allow for maximum possible occupancy of dormitory space to obtain maximum revenue. She said the administration was probably also waiting until they had some idea of how many freshmen would be coming next year. The drawings for order in choosing rooms for next year are presently planned for the second week of May. At least two weeks are usually needed to complete the operation. Nicholls said that if the drawing were not held then, the room selection process might be forced into the summer months.

**Group Backs April 24 Offensive**

By GRAY WILSON
Managing Editor

The Davidson Peace Coalition has decided to throw its weight behind April 24 as the important date in the spring offensive to end the Vietnam War. “There are many reasons,” said junior Mark Meza, spokesman for the group, “but one of the strengths of April 24 over May 1 lies in its legitimacy. This split over dates is nationwide, and we are trying to iron this out...Aid for incoming freshmen will be in the form of loans and work-study. Assistant Director of Financial Aid Peter V. Sterling estimated that approximately 199-200 incoming freshmen will require some financial assistance, whereas only 40 percent of the class of '74 required aid. "Despite the fact that the college is increasing the money it is putting into scholarships, costs have increased, more people are applying for scholarships, and the average need of each applicant has increased," said Sterling. "The applicants with strong qualifications will have all their needs met," he said. "But the small group of incoming freshmen who didn't rate as high as the others will have to turn to state government loans or go to a cheaper college." Sterling noted that there will be no change in the financial policy for upperclassmen.

Vice President for Academic Affairs John M. Bevan said that the financial aid decision was made by the administration. "Frankly, I’m surprised that the previous financial policy lasted this long," he said. "There are very few colleges that are able to meet all the financial needs of their students."

Meza explained that the possibility of civil disobedience was much less on the earlier date, and that a number of repeat mass marches are planned for the day. He added that it will be more convenient for students taking comprehensives and medicals to go on April 24. In its meeting Tuesday night, the coalition voted to provide transportation for people going up to Washington on either weekend.

The first of the activities planned by the group on campus included two 45-minute films which were shown in the College Union Thursday night and will be run again tonight. The May Day Tribe produced the first movie, "Time Is Running Out," and the second is a Schoenbruner film, "Vietnam and Beyond," based on his actual trip to South Vietnam. Junior Cecil Burney is trying to arrange for Agnes Hofstettler to speak on campus sometime in the next few weeks.

Meza said that one of the most important ecumenical church events will be a service to be held before April 24, one to end the war immediately, but one for peace. "We hope that people will take advantage of what we are offering here so that they will have some kind of moral commitment before they go to Washington."

This week, several members have been circulating the People's Peace Treaty, dispensing copies in the dorms and contacting professors. The group stated that a part of the group wanted to bring the treaty before the student Senate for sponsorship since the National Student Associations (NSA), of which the Senate is a member, originally backed the document. Beginning Thursday night, the group also began taking the treaty into the town of Davidson, waging a door-to-door campaign to gather signatures.

A peace vigil on campus is planned about three days before the April 24 trip, and the coalition has contacted Queens College to see if such an event might be able to include both schools. The split over the April 24-May 1 offensive began last March after the Cambodia protests. The National Peace Action Coalition (NPAC) was concentrating solely on ending the war, which led to a break with the People’s Coalition for Peace and Justice (PCPJ), a group which wanted to include larger domestic problems into the thrust of the protest.
