THE DAVIDSONIAN

WILDCAT NINE LEAVES ON VIRGINIA TRIP

THE LATEST From Diamond and Cinder Path
P. R. ALDERMAN

With the advent of April, King Baseball assumes full sway in the world of sports. The 'Cats have already gotten
well under way, however, although with losses as well as wins. But it must be admitted that the Red and
Black nine has some mighty bright prospects, as was shown in the Cornell game. The latter having given Carolina a
sound thrashing indicates that it was an off day for our diamond men and also that we'll prove this before
the season advances much further.

There oughtn’t to be much kick about that Wake Forest track meet! It’s nothing to overlook—amassing over a hundred points
against a college the size of Wake Forest. And it sounds still better when we remember that football contest last
fall, doesn’t it? V. P. I. won a hard-fought contest from the trackmen, but this victory makes things look much
better.

Well, the Kitten Nine won their first game of the season, which is more than the Varsity can boast, even
though it was from Cornelius. Curtis in the box showed form for the first game. Let's back the Fresh—there’s no
reason why they shouldn't have a big season.

It has been stated that Davidson has four of the best dashmen anywhere around. This was undoubtedly fulfilled by Whittle,
Currie, Kell, and Brohard in the Wake Forest and V. P. I. meets. Capt. Currie is as speedy as ever
if not more so, and Whittle bids fair to shatter a few more records before the season is over. This
is the weekend for the Tech relays, and furthermore, judging from the twenty or more entries, there’s going to be
some speed shown when the best dashmen in the South compete for honors. Everybody’s expecting big things from Whittle and
Currie and, seeing that they got twelve points each in the Wake Forest meet, we believe they'll have a lot
to do with showing that speed.

In spite of the fact that Wake Forest got only two first places you’ve got to hand it to Dupree,
who copped one of them, for hurling the javelin 165 feet and 5 inches, beating the Davidson record by seven
inches. Kinsey, winner of the other first place, also deserves credit. His distance in the broad jump was 22 feet.

Rain didn’t seem to impair “Sleepy” Goodson’s hitting power in the Oak Ridge game. He connected for a single and
a triple out of three times up. Goodson, who was first-sackman on the Fresh nine last year, was one of
the most consistent hitters on the squad, and he bids fair to be a mainstay in the ’Cats offensive this
season.

That was a great game “Buck” Marrow twirled against the nine from Cornell University! It’s no easy thing to hold
a big northern team to no runs and only six scattered hits. With Marrow, Proctor, and Goodson, Sophs, showing up
so well prospects are mighty bright for the Wildcat nine during the next few years.

CURRENT COMMENT
(Continued from page 2)

Such smaller radiators have proved several percent more efficient than the water-cooled type. A good many Americans who flew in
the World War are now in Mexico looking for excitement. They hire themselves out to whichever side offers the best
price and enter the service with high salaries. It remains to be seen what will happen when Americans of opposite
sides meet in aerial conflict.

If the new thirteen-month calendar is adopted with four weeks for each month, the old rhyme might be changed to
read:
“Twenty-eight days has September,
April, June, and November
All the rest have 28 days,
Except February, which has 28 days.”

“And, now, sir,” thundered the lawyer, “tell the court what you were doing in the interim.”
“I didn’t go there,” was the angry reply. “I stayed in the living-room the whole evening.”

Wildcat Trackmen Take Meet From Wake Forest By Overwhelming Score
Davidson Takes All But Two First Places
DUPREE IS DEACON STAR
Currie and Whittle Win Two Firsts and One Second Place Each

The Davidson Wildcat trackmen took their dual from Wake Forest last Saturday by the top-heavy score of 101 to 25.
Davidson won every first place except two, and won all three places in four of the events.

Currie, showing the best form he has displayed this year, won both the 100-yard dash and the 220 and placed
second in the 440-yard run. His time for the century was ten flat; just about the best time that that
event has been won in by any of the Wildcat sprinters this year.

Heath Whittle also turned in two first places and a second. He came through first in both the hurdle events
and came in second in the hundred-yard dash. He and Currie tied for high point honors of the meet; each
getting twelve points.

Dupree, of Wake Forest, won one of the two first places which went to his team. He gave the javelin
a ride for 168 feet, 5 inches, to easily top his competitors in the spear throwing event. His heave beat
the Davidson record by seven inches. Kinsey won the other first for the visitors by winning the broad jump. His
leap was 22 feet flat.

The Wildcats all looked good in Saturday's meet, especially in the dashes and hurdles.

Professor Brearly—I know the best thing on earth for a bald head.
“Monkey” Sherrill—What’s that?
Professor Brearly—Lots of hair.

He (in a quandary)—Field goal.
She (in a raccoon)—No; very comfy, thanks!

According to statistics, spinsters live longer than married women. While there’s hope there’s life!

the leading hitters and fielders for the Presbyterians this season.

Davidson Wins From Cornell University
Marrow Strikes Out Eight, Allowing Only Six Hits

The Davidson Wildcats played a fine game at Greensboro, April 2, and defeated the Cornell University nine by the score
of 5 to 0. Marrow held Cornell to six hits and struck out eight men. Stief and Crosby both got
two hits off Marrow. Rollo replaced Madden for Cornell in the second inning.

Ratchford, Davidson captain and first man up, hit a double and the team tallied two runs on another hit and
a sacrifice in the opening inning. In the third, following Proctor’s double, two more runs were scored. The box score:
