THE DAVIDSONIAN

Scott Lafranchi

When will we ever learn? A couple of years ago, Rob Knight, a highly involved and very motivated member of
the Intervarsity Christian Fellowship, submitted his application for an IVCF leadership position. He was epitomizing the Davidson tradition; he was
going beyond the academic requirements. But shortly after Rob submitted his application, he was informed by a member of the
organization that he was ineligible for leadership. No, Rob did not practice patterns of gossip and slander; drunkenness; pre-marital sex;
selfish ambition; lewdness, and by no means hatred. Why then was he denied? Why then was he turned away even
before a free democratic vote? Rob had his desire to be a leader in his religion revoked because he is
different in the eyes of the ignorant. Rob is gay.

According to the Davidson powers that be, we are gathered together in these serene surroundings and this highly intellectual community
“to liberate the minds of young men and women for useful lives of leadership and service.” Hence, Davidson students reacted
with courage and reason when Rob’s story was revealed to us. In due time, our Student Government debated this issue
with great passion and diction, and rendered their decision which essentially stated that since “The Senate of Davidson College does
hereby condemn discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, sex, and sexual orientation,” we will not charter
the IVCF because they prevent homosexuals from obtaining leadership positions in their organization.

When a group is chartered by Davidson College, they are entitled to official status which entails use of school letterhead
and absolute affiliation with Davidson. In addition, they are free to request funds and office space for their business. As
a result of what a charter status means, the SGA refused to renew the IVCF charter because it would in
effect be condoning discrimination. However, IVCF appealed the decision.

Somewhere in the vast expanse of Baker parking lot stands a car. That car belongs to me. If one were
to see it one would notice something is missing. That something is a 1996-97 Davidson College parking permit. Along with
other returning students this year, I was shocked at the twenty dollar increase in parking costs. Vice President of Business
and Finance Robert Norfleet in Issue #2 of The Davidsonian gave reasons for the price hike. He mentioned an effort
to “keep [tuition] costs down” and our low parking costs in comparison to other regional schools. The rate of other
schools is unimportant. Other schools of our size in this region do not charge over $100,000 for an education. Other
schools are not Davidson! I do think it’s cute, however, that they are keeping tuition down by raising permit prices
up. Who are they kidding?

With the rise in prices and statements like these I expected outrage! I expected protest! I expected too much. Gasps
of shock quickly transformed into the clink of student coins in the college coffers. Why was there no action? Perhaps
because the Freshmen had never known any differently. Others maybe had no qualms about handing out twenty more dollars of
mommy and daddy’s money. Tell me I’m wrong. The SGA did launch an investigation of the whole affair in their
very first meeting and proposed to study it over the next seven weeks. I praise their action and it may
help next year, but the time to act is now! Actually, the time to act was then. The moment has
passed. The accountants have won. Davidson has its money, but not mine.

It may seem silly to you for me to get worked up over twenty dollars, but it is more the
principle than the money. Not every Davidson student is affluent. With the increase in tuition every year, more students with
wealth of mind, but not of pocket, are shut out from our community and we are the poorer for it.
At a school that praises diversity yet no longer gives full financial aid to qualified but needy students, any price
increase is a major one. This is true for some and should be a concern for all. The permit price
increase is harmful, unnecessary, and unjustified and until Mr. Norfleet or another...administrator gives us a good reason for it, we
have no reason to believe otherwise. ©1996 B84 Marr

I'M CONFUSED ABOUT THE ELECTION. YOU'RE VOTING FOR: SLEAZY OR SLIMY. IT'S HARD TO VOTE FOR SLIMY, SO I GUESS
YOU SHOULD VOTE FOR SLEAZY. YOU JUST GOTTA DECIDE WHO EVEN THOUGH WE BOTH KNOW SLEAZY'S TOO SLIPPERY. AT LEAST
SLEAZY HAS SAVVY. SLIMY'S SO SAGEY. SLEAZY'S PRETTY SNEAKY, LET'S FACE IT: SLIMY'S TOO STINGY AND SLEAZY'S TOO SPENDY.

GrindoUd vw AG PEI AvraWES 3300093 IV Ib! EI sust BeSaucrions, Even THOUGH SLIMY'S PRETENDING HE'S SLEAZY, AND SHIFTY'S SLIMY'S
RUNNING MATE, AND SLEEPY'S SLEAZY. IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS, YOU HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION. ONE MIGHT SAY, WHAT NEW
EVIDENCE DID THEY HAVE TO PROMPT THEIR APPEAL? NO, THEY DID NOT HAVE ANY UNDISCLOSED MORAL ISSUES, BUT THEY DID
HAVE A REQUEST FROM THE PRESIDENT AND THE DEAN OF STUDENTS FOR THE SGA TO RECONSIDER ITS DECISION. REMEMBER THAT
IT WAS NOT AN ORDER, BUT RATHER A MERE SUGGESTION. IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT THE SGA SHOULD HAVE
THOUGHT BACK TO THE ORIGIN OF EDUCATION. THEY SHOULD HAVE REMEMBERED THE PURPOSE OF DAVIDSON, AND RECALLED THAT THIS INSTITUTION
IS FOR THE STUDENTS AND NOT FOR ANY OTHER. ULTIMATELY, THE SGA BUCKLED UNDER THE PRESSURES OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND
THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH, AND VOTED TO CHARTER THE IVCF. FURTHERMORE, THEY CHANGED THE VERY FOUNDATION OF THE SGA. IT NOW
READS, “THAT THE SENATE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE DOES HEREBY CONDEMN DISCRIMINATION BASED ON RACE, COLOR, RELIGION, NATIONAL ORIGIN, AGE, DISABILITY,
SEX, AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION EXCEPT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND ALLOWED BY LAW.”

MY FELLOW DAVIDSONIANS, DISCRIMINATION IS NEVER APPROPRIATE, EVEN WHEN IT IS ALLOWED BY LAW, AND AS A PRESBYTERIAN, AND A
DAVIDSON COLLEGE STUDENT, I BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD NEVER REST UNTIL EVERY MEMBER OF THIS COMMUNITY IS TRULY FREE TO
LIBERATE THEIR MINDS FOR USEFUL LIVES OF LEADERSHIP AND SERVICE.

Crimson Pride

Okay—I’ve now been at Davidson for two years and I am finally fed up. After enduring literally hundreds of inbred
cracks, armpit-of-the-nation comments and Forrest Gump jokes, I am at last going to try to set the record straight about
my home state. Yes, that’s right—my name is Rachel...and I’m from Alabama. I’m tired of hanging my head in shame—It’s
time to get everything out in the open about Alabama, both good and bad, so I can go on with
my life. Maybe there are a few hard-core redneck facets to life in Alabama; I can admit that. So maybe
Talladega is the home of the International Motor Sports Hall of Fame; and the Hank Williams Jr. International Fan Club
headquarters might just happen to be in Cullman near the Key Underwood Coon Dog Memorial Graveyard—fine, BIG DEAL. And so
what if our governor decided to switch our highways to the metric system, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on
new kilometer markers that no one in the state really understands. Who cares if our public schools are ranked among
the worst in the nation...why dwell on the negative? I can just laugh that much harder at the Andover and
Exeter graduates because I still got into Davidson with my free Alabama education.

There are so many amazing things about Alabama that people often overlook that I could never provide a complete account,
but allow me to educate you as succinctly as possible... Did you know that the world’s largest space museum is
in Huntsville, Alabama? Did you know that Jimmy Buffett, Willie Mays, Courtney Cox, Charles Barkley, Truman Capote, Joe Lewis and
Helen Keller are all Alabamians? Did you know that the world’s only statue dedicated to the boll weevil can be
found in Enterprise, Alabama? I'll bet you didn’t. We are not a bunch of inbred, toothless, pick-up drivin’, racist crackers—this
is an unfair, uninformed generalization. Just because I like grits, Crimson Tide football, country music and say y’all, does that
make me less of a person? I reckon some people think so, but I don’t care. I’m tired of people
snickering when I tell them where I’m from (and no, for the last time, there is no such place as
Greenbow). I’m from Alabama, and by-God, I’m proud of it. I think Lynyrd Skynyrd perhaps said it best...sweet home, Alabama.
