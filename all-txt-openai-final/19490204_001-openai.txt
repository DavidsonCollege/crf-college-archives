Charlotte Sets $750,000 Goal: February 10, Named Davidson Day

The theme of the Charlotte-Davidson Drive, "Davidson is Charlotte’s own college," was announced recently by Mr. Averson, head of the
Davidson College Development Program. On February 10, the Mayor of Charlotte, Herbert I. Baxter, will proclaim that Davidson College is
officially in the city limits and that February 10 is to be known as Davidson Day.

New Novels Offer Interesting Reading

Mr. Carly McCraw, a prominent Baptist, is in charge of the plans which include Davidson decorations and sales in the
leading Charlotte concerns. Students will be placed in prominent civic posts in the city government and positions in the commercial
world. The Kick-Off Dinner for a fund to raise $750,000 will be held on February 11. This drive will last
for 10 days. Incidentally, Charlotte has never raised over $300,000 in any one drive before. This drive has been divided
into three parts, with J. Caldwell McDonald in charge of the section to solicit special gifts; Olen Nisbet and David
McConnell are in charge of the gifts from corporations; 250 men constitute the third section which is divided into the
Red division and the Black division. George Gouch and Howard Arbuckle are in charge of this section to solicit funds
from the general public.

Mr. Averson expressed strong optimism that the goal will be reached, and he appreciated the wholehearted cooperation shown by the
citizens of Charlotte.

Davidson students heard a very interesting talk by Mr. Wilson, a former chaplain in the British Army. Born in the
small town of Oban, Scotland, Mr. Wilson, for the first time, came over to America this past September to be
with his family who are living in Lynchburg, Virginia. After being in the army for seven years, from 1939 to
1946, Mr. Wilson was the secretary representing the World Council of Churches, meeting in Geneva, Switzerland. During his service in
the Northwest European campaign, which included fighting in Scotland, Belgium, and Germany, he was among the evacuees from Dunkirk and
was also in the first wave of troops to land on French soil on the memorable D-Day. Before entering the
service of his country, Mr. Wilson did graduate and undergraduate work at the University of Edinburgh and at Marburg University,
the latter noted as the objective of the recent Davidson Christmas Gift Fund.

Mr. Wilson opened his talk by commenting on the influence of hate and its effect on the peoples of Europe
who were under Nazi oppression. He illustrated his point by relating two experiences he had encountered while in Holland. In
a small town that his attachment had invaded, he was helping bury...

Horace Heidt Show

The Horace Heidt talent show, broadcast from the Charlotte Armory on Sunday, January 3, was attended by throngs despite freezing
weather and white harbingers of an impending snowfall. The two-and-a-half-hour show, which preceded the broadcast, was composed of performances by
a galaxy of stars who were former victors in various contests in Heidt's coast-to-coast, border-to-border tours. The show included dancers,
vocalists, and musicians of a wide variety. Particularly outstanding in this pre-broadcast show was Richard Melari, 18 years old, from
Cleveland, Ohio, with his vocal impressions of Perry Como, Frank Sinatra, Al Jolson, and Eddie Cantor.

Mention of others of the talented group should include 18-year-old dancer Devy Davenport, formerly of Fort Bragg, N.C., whose first
name, given her by her Cherokee Indian father, means "dance." Little Ernie Camarato, youngest of the group with 4 years,
stood on a chair to render his vocals, which were invariably followed by a flurry of kisses thrown by him
to the audience. Scruggs and Upchurch and Willig Coggin, Davidson’s contribution to the melting pot of talent, who were eliminated
in the final try-outs for the broadcast, competed in a contest just before the broadcast, Scruggs and Upchurch emerging victorious
to receive cash prizes as did Coggin, who tied for second place. Some of those from this section who won
a place on the half-hour broadcast were a Negro quartet from Raleigh; Miss Patty Osborne, the talented Miss North Carolina
of 1938, and a young factory clerk-singer from Charlotte. The contest was won for the fifth consecutive week by a
nine-year-old drummer from New York. An added attraction of the broadcast was the music of Nox, a former champion of
Heidt's contests. Nox remained after the broadcast to entertain the audience with his music.

As for Heidt himself, his career in radio was a recourse followed after his dreams of becoming a professional athlete
were shattered by a fractured back sustained in a football game. He has organized...

British Chaplain Speaks on “Our Debt To Germany”

Davidson, North Carolina, Friday, February 4, 1949

Take Vows; Cicero Extends Blessing

John Hobart Derrick William Barton, Esquire of Hord, Essex, England, plighted his troth to Miss Martha Ivon Beaty of the
community in a 5:30 p.m. wedding at the Presbyterian Church yesterday. The ceremony was performed by a Bible professor dressed
in a solid cream-colored zoot suit, which was characterized by drape pants pegged to ten inches, welt seams, a three-foot
pocket chain, over-padded shoulders, and a Windsor tie as large as a billiard ball. His name was Bunny Floyd. A
Charlotte maid, Betty Johnson, rendered melodious noises by tying her vocal cords in a series of slip knots. Buford Y.
Goodman, a noted music student of the college, assisted her in the feat by performing a number of major operations
on the organ.

The father of the bride has disclosed that his new son-in-law asked him days before the wedding if he could
serve as mayor of Cornelius, but Davidson's own Cicero, who characteristically observes legal...Principles, allowed as how it was outside of
his jurisdiction to grant such a favor. The newlywed couple were last seen knitting their way from Glacier-North Carolina. Some
German soldiers, along with the aid of Dutch peasants, were involved. One of the peasants thereupon, in the midst of
the burial, spat on the face of the dead German. On another occasion, he saw Dutch men dragging through the
streets of a village a woman about 35 years of age. They placed her upon a platform and proceeded to
cut her hair off until she was completely bald. This punishment was for collaborating with the Nazis.

The speaker pointed out that the spiritual and psychological situation in Europe today is “due to three thoughts among these
hapless people, namely mistreatment, cynicism, and pessimism.” The conditions in Germany presented somewhat a gloomy picture, but they must be
regarded with supreme importance. Twice in the century, they have practically destroyed the world. National Socialism in the country still
has a strong grip, even after the war. The point is that we conquered them and now we must help
them get back on their feet. Mr. Wilson said that the minds of the German youth had been warped the
wrong way, due to three main causes—first, ignorance, having been shut off from everybody else for 12 years, they do
not know what is happening outside of Germany. They have lost contact with the past. Second, the young people are
conditioned to certain beliefs and because of defeat, they have not forgotten these shams. The so-called “Hitler Youth” have been
drilled with hate toward Christianity and democracy. They plainly do not know what democracy is or any (Continued On Page

Flushed Homecomers Strive To Make Adventures Of Don Juan Seem Like A Date With Whistler's Mother

Long and tedious process. Long because first they have to find collar buttons, studs, bow ties, and cuff links, and
tedious because then they have to install them. Having completed this and having waited forty-five minutes for their dates, who
had promised to be on time, they set off for the big event. The banquet is the first official part
of “Mid-winters.” Dainty dates say they're not very hungry and then gulp down everything in sight, including half of their
escort's dinner. After a speech four cigarettes long, a few shady jokes, and some songs, they leave with high expectations
of a thrilling weekend.

The couples now fight their way into a smoke-filled dance hall from which the music of Johnny Satterfield can be
heard. Our would-be crowd likes it because it makes them feel close to their dates. Declaring themselves hungry at intermission,
the students leave with their dates only to return later still hungry. After the dances, the couples go to say
goodnight. They leave in time for classes where understanding professors allow them to sleep unmolested until dinnertime. The informal dance
on Saturday night tops off the weekend and is followed by a day of many sad farewells as our coeds-for-a-weekend,
worn out but happy, leave us for their homes or schools. What are you doing for Spring Frolics?

IFT REVIVES HOPE AT MARBURG

(Church World Service Announces Shipment Of Food Supplies To German University; Dr. Frick Expresses Thanks To Davidson College And The
Students)

Although our Christmas Gift Fund Drive was completed only a month ago, letters of thanks and appreciation from the students
and faculty of Marburg College are already coming in to the YMCA. The gift of over six thousand dollars was
placed in the hands of Church World Services, and they have provided for the most pressing needs of the college.
The condition confronting the students in Germany today was made known to our student body during the drive and the
Gift Fund has been to alleviate as much as possible any of these hardships and to let them know that
we are interested in them. From these letters, we receive appreciation and gratitude.

(From a written letter to Vowels by a former student now with the radio branch of Military Liaison and Security
Office at Frankfurt):

"This is a very commendable gesture. I can assure them that the money will be put to a very worthy
use. The position of the students at the universities is deplorable, and any effort to help them is deeply appreciated.
It is only too clear that we, the German people, are to learn democracy. The general thought is that the
younger generation now at the schools and universities..."

The following radio transcript was broadcast from Frankfurt:

"A proposal to give the school a two-day holiday next year between December 28 and the end of exams and
the beginning of the next term is under consideration. Note that Church World Service portioned a part of the fund
for the treatment of the blind students now at the university. (Translation by Prof. E.A. Heaney): The student body of
Davidson College in North Carolina will then have their annual Christmas Gift Fund for the year granted to the students
of Marburg with special attention to the blind students. The drive has been to alleviate as much as possible any
of these hardships and to let them know that we are interested in them. From these letters, we receive appreciation

PAN HEL RELEASES HISTORY OF SATTERFIELD'S ORCHESTRA

It seems that there is some doubt in most people's minds as to what Johnny Satterfield has in store for
us come the “Lost Weekend!” For the sake of the cats about the school, allow me to make a few
statements concerning the band and Satterfield himself. The band is composed of sixteen pieces, all being Carolina students. Four trumpets,
three trombones, five saxophones with three rhythm men head the preferred instrumentation. The talent list is headed by Sam Andrews,
tenor saxophonist; Jim Crawford, alto saxophonist; Nelson Benton, drummer; Chuck Simpson and Jerry McDuffie, trumpeters; Norman Delaney, trombonist; and of
course, Ruth Justice, vocalist, who was recently seen around the World’s finest night club circuit. Also, John Usninend, one of
the foremost authorities on music, has predicted the band to be a great success in the years to come. The
performance of the well-rehearsed Satterfield band is expected to be a big success and the boys are looking forward to
swinging you into a great dance.
