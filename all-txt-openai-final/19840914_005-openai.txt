"I'm also excited about living in Germany. Iâ€™m looking forward to traveling and doing some skiing. And I really want
to learn the language and get to know the people.

"I got into ROTC really just to see what it was all about. For me, it all couldn't have worked
out better."

Army ROTC got Anda Strauss off to a good start. Maybe it can do the same for you. To find
out, stop by your Army ROTC office on campus. While you're there, ask about our scholarships and $1,000 a year
spending money you can earn in your last two years.

And begin your future as an officer.
