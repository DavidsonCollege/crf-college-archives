### Mike Sorrentino: He Went from Being a Basketball Star to a Modern-day Thoreau, and Nowhere Along the Way Did
He Keep Pace with His Companions

**By STEVE SOUD ’84**

In thirty years of life, Mike Sorrentino has never really fallen into a particular route or beaten path. From his
years as number 13 on the Davidson basketball teams of the early 1970s to his months in a treehouse as
a sort of modern-day Thoreau, Mike Sorrentino has never followed evenly the pace of his companions. He is one of
few Davidson graduates—or human beings, for that matter—who has had the courage to live out his convictions. Peering into this
man’s life is like gently separating and softly prying apart the petals of an enigmatic rosebud.

He came to Davidson from a New York City background that everyone knew about but few understood. As a record-setting
basketball player, he rose to the pinnacle of achievement and then questioned its foundation. After four years of aimless, post-graduation
meandering across Europe, he returned to Davidson and lived in a lonely, secluded treehouse. For now, at least, he has
come to an unexpected resting place working in a Durham bakery.

Perhaps, after his years of wandering and homelessness, Sorrentino, like Thoreau, has learned at the very least that “if one
advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will
meet with a success unexpected in common hours.”

Basketball and its dreams of glory saturated his childhood. Like thousands of New York City schoolchildren, he whiled away the
lazy summer days of his boyhood playing the city game. But for years he sought to live out his dreams.
He played basketball at New York powerhouse Archbishop Molloy High School. He was never a star; he didn’t even start
until his senior year. That year Molloy went 22-1 and won the Catholic league championship.

“My coach in high school took nothing less from us but perfection,” Sorrentino once told a reporter for the *Charlotte
Observer*. “If I played bad, I went home and locked myself in my room, threw temper tantrums, and kicked chairs.
I’d yell at my parents and things like that. But that didn’t settle anything. It didn’t make me play any
better the next time. But that’s the way I felt about basketball. It meant everything to me.”

Much to Sorrentino’s frustration, he was an afterthought to college recruiters. Rather, classmate Brian Winters drew their attention. Frank McGuire,
who had lured Molloy stars Kevin Joyce and Bob Carver to South Carolina the previous year, returned to New York
in the spring of 1970 and signed Winters. In June, Sorrentino followed the paths of Molloy alumni Brian Adrian and
Mike Maloy as he signed with Davidson. “I thought maybe I could be a star at a small school,” he
mused later.

NCAA regulations of the time required that freshmen sit out their first year. Playing for Davidson’s freshman team, Sorrentino averaged
15.4 ppg and 11 assists per game at his point guard position. After Sorrentino’s freshman performance had established him as
a future Wildcat star, he returned home for the summer and did some self-evaluation.

“When I went back home, I played at the playgrounds and never got a chance to touch the ball. In
Davidson, I was a big man; in New York, I was nothing,” he explained. “That’s when I realized that I’d
never be really great in basketball. Then it struck me that maybe all the work had been for nothing.”

Sorrentino’s soul-searching held over into his sophomore year.year, and it greatly affected his play in the early going. In a
January 1972 interview published in the Observer, he admitted, “I haven’t been trying in practice and I know it. Coach
Holland knows it, and I guess the players know it. But the players are great, they’re letting me work out
this problem by myself. Right now, I’m hurting the rest of the team, and that isn’t fair to them.”

The problem ran deep. He was questioning his own rationale for playing the game which had dominated a large portion
of his life. “There’s so many things I could be doing with my life right now,” he said. “I really
think I could contribute more to society than playing basketball.” He went on, “Maybe I’m just tired of all the
things that go along with playing basketball. You know, all the discipline and things like that. I think basketball should
be fun, and right now it isn’t to me. This is something I’ve thought out all by myself. And it’s
bothered me a lot. It’s kept me awake at night, followed me into the classroom, and hurt me in practice.”

His own questions were not the only matter at stake in his self-inquiry. Along with his questions coincided team unrest
that was symptomatic of the turbulent times. There was a major team squabble over hair length. “If a player has
a disagreement,” Sorrentino once said, “I think he should be able to speak his mind. And the length of someone’s
hair doesn’t dictate how he’ll play basketball. Take those VMI players, for instance. They all have real short hair and
can’t play that well. I don’t think that any of us want to cause trouble. We’re just trying to be
ourselves and have fun.”

Unfortunately, at that time in Sorrentino’s life, fun came less often and in smaller doses than he might have liked.
Fun was lacking from his court life in such great quantities that he seriously considered quitting basketball altogether. It meant
quitting his dreams. “I’ve thought about it several times,” he admitted. “But I don’t know if I could just walk
off the court and turn my back on all I’ve worked for. But again, if I ever really decide that
it isn’t really worth the effort anymore, then I'll give it up for good. If I keep playing, it will
have to be 100 percent. That’s the way it has to be.”

If basketball wasn’t going well for Sorrentino at that time, the rest of his college life was. As a freshman,
he had received the nickname “Bruno” Sorrentino after a professional wrestler named Bruno San Martino. Later he declared himself an
English major and became very active in the desegregation and coeducation movements at Davidson. He was one of a “group
of students here at the time who were very interested in social questions and very interested in making an outreach,”
English Professor Tony Abbott remembers.

Mike Sorrentino was an individual. He loved the outdoors and often slept out. “Mike was more of an ‘Outward Bound’
type. It was a very colorful crowd here then,” Abbott says now. But it was the very fact that Sorrentino
was so “inward bound” that enabled him to work out his troubles with basketball. When he did, he bettered his
own vow of either quitting or giving 100 percent by giving 110 percent. He earned a reputation as an intense
player and fierce competitor. At the same time, he was able to laugh off the nights he played poorly. In
his first two years as a starter, the team went 37-18.
