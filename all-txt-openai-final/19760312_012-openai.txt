Bazbo Exploits Clouds

By JACK GOLDEN
Staff Writer

The violet haze of the summer evening made the clouds dance before his eyes. They moved, it seemed to him, as if guided by some superior intellect. What message did they mean to impart to him? The panorama was so engrossing he completely tuned out the lecture on social patterns of post-war Janians. With an unfaltering step, he strode towards the transparent wall of the teaching module.

Yes, the clouds were calling to him. Enthralled by their siren song, he pressed against the wall. Then he saw it, the message of the gods: Flash Bazbo, Space Cadet. He knew then what he had to do.

“Bazbo, what the hell are you doing with those clouds?” barked kindly old spinster lady teacher, Miss ——.

But our young hero was oblivious to her remarks. His mind was filled with only one thought: he, Ray A. Bazbo, the most intelligent Beta-2 in his form, would enter the Federation Space Academy.

We return to the world of animation for this week’s questions:

1. Name Popeye’s nephews.

2. Sherman and Mr. Peabody were transported in time by the —— machine.

3. What was the name of George of the Jungle’s simian friend?

4. “Sufferin’ Succotash” was repeated many times by ——.

5. What is the name of the Rubbles’ pet?

6. What transformed Super Chicken?

7. Name the three villains from Underdog.

Bandwagon
