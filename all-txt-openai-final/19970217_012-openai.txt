Healthy Living

Don’t let winter leave you cold and unhappy
By Joanna Davis
Staff Personal Trainer

I believe all of us here at Davidson would agree that through our college years we have learned all about
hectic living. But how much have we learned about Healthy Living? How often in your busy schedule, filled with studies
and job interviews, do you think about your nutritional needs, your exercise habits, or your excessive intake of caffeine or
nicotine? Beginning this week, I will try to provide tips on adopting a healthy lifestyle. I hope that with your
input and questions, I can appeal to your interests. I am always open to any questions and topic suggestions, so
please feel free to contact me.

To begin, I thought we could use a few tips on how to avoid or pull out of those February
Blues. I’m sure you all know what I mean — that feeling you get this time of the semester when
all you want to do each morning is throw your alarm clock across the room and crawl back under the
covers for a long winter’s nap. This week, try to find time in your hectic schedule to pamper yourself, and
most importantly to reward yourself for all the hard work you have done and are doing here at Davidson. Here
are my top ten tips to help you say goodbye to those February Blues.1) Get outside. If you have to,
bundle up, but get out there and let the fresh air revive you. Grab a bike and go for a
ride. Grab a friend and go for a walk. Check out the Baseball, Tennis, and Lacrosse teams. You can get
some fresh air, soak up some rays, and show some school spirit while you’re at it.

2) Find time to be with friends. Sure, you are with them in class, and you meet for study groups
in the library, but grab some friends and do something fun. You have time, I promise. You’ll study better later
when you are de-stressed and fulfilled. Play cards, go to a movie, play a game of pick-up basketball. Anything to
do a little bonding.

3) Splurge a little. We, as Davidson students, all live fairly regimented lives. But sometimes it’s good to break your
own rules. It will relax you. Spend the extra cash and get your nails done or treat yourself to a
massage. Walk to Ben and Jerry’s for some ice cream—a little bit never hurt anyone. Put down your books and
grab your favorite magazine. You deserve it.

4) Have a heart-healthy meal. You seniors who are blessed with a kitchen, pull out a cookbook and prepare a
healthy meal with your roommates. It will not only be good for your heart but it will be fun. Experiment
a little. For those of you who do not have cooking utensils on hand, head for the Commons, the Union,
or your favorite local restaurant and try something new, something healthy. You never know, you might like it!

5) Lather up. Even though we don’t have the luxury of bathtubs, grab a washcloth, a bottle of sweet-smelling suds,
and head for the shower. Enjoy a long, hot soak, and don’t let your hallmates or roommates kick you out.
If you’re brave, sing some tunes while you are in there. It might be fun!

6) Eat breakfast. It will really wake you up. I promise! You will be surprised how much more energy you
have to get you through your day if you start the day by giving your body some fuel.

7) Jump on the Internet. There is no better way to rid oneself of the February Blues than by going
somewhere tropical. You can go anywhere in the world without even leaving your dorm room, the library, or the computer
center. If traveling is not your thing, look up anything interesting. Learn something new. Let your mind do the traveling.

8) Start a journal. Not only will this allow you to express some of those low-down February Blues on paper
and thus get them out of your system, but it will give you something to look back on. Write down
some fun things you’ve been doing, or funny jokes you’ve heard. Then, next winter when you are tempted to hide
away, bring out your journal, look back on the past, and smile.

9) Smile. Give a smile or a kind word to each person you come in contact with today. You will
be surprised how much you get back in return and how good it will make you feel to bring some
light into someone else’s life.

10) Reach for the stars. Sit down and make a list of goals that you want to work toward accomplishing
this year. Now get started. You have it in you. Now go for it and don’t let those February Blues
hold you back!
