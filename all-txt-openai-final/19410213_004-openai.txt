ports = lants ree - Wildcat — HODGIN OF WINSTON PINS TURNAGE

Looking over the sketch, we find it, with only two weeks of contest left, that the chances of Davidson’s cagers in the tournament are somewhat slim. Slowed down, the 'Cats have only begun a whirlwind finish, winning the ice in the tournament. Many changes will assert themselves in the game, and we may find ourselves among Raleigh.

On Cat Squad Many Shifts Tried As Gridders Work Hard

An example of the Wildcat spirit showed itself in the game with N. C. State and Carolina last week. The heavily-favored Phantoms ran up against a tight Davidson defense and barely managed to eke out a 38-30 victory over the 'Cats. The mighty George Glamack, who has been averaging 20 points per game, was held to 11 points by John Belk and Don Bell. Davidson’s Jimmy Hogg wore out three Phantom guards to capture top scoring honors with 15 points. Credit should also be extended to the rest of the 'Cat cagers for their all-around fine floor game that kept the Phantoms in check.

In the State game, Jimmy Hogg has amassed a total of 122 points in Conference games for the season, averaging 15 points a game. Carrying on as one of the last regulars left of the fine team of two years ago, Jimmy has made the Davidson basketeers a winning threat in every game this year. His graduation this year will rob the team of their outstanding performer. Lanky John Belk, sophomore center from Charlotte, has seen considerable service with the Wildcat five this season. Frequent grabbing of rebounds has been his specialty. Murphy Williams, Greensboro guard, has looked good in patches and scrimmages.

Gridiron Glimpses

After a week’s intensive spring football drills, the report is that the coaches are tickled with what looks to be a well-balanced grid squad for next year. Led by 15 good backs and a good line, the fifty candidates for next year’s grid honors have looked in the early scrimmages to be the best eleven in several years on the Davidson field. The call is for putting out my neck to pick the team that will trot on the field next year as the best in several years. The team will be: Ends: Shaw and Rainey; Tackle: Rolin; Backs: Hackney.

Carolina Wins Over Kittens

Carolina crushed Duke 27-3 in bad weather to capture the title. Joe DiMaggio came through to man the center.
