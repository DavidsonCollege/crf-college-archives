**Gay-Straight Alliance Makes Debut**

After several attempts to form a solid campus organization for gay support, Alison Shea ’03 has taken the initiative to
organize the Gay-Straight Alliance (GSA). The group held its first meeting on Sept. 26, and over 30 students and at
least 10 faculty and administrators attended.

“It was great to see that kind of support,” said Shea, who especially appreciated appearances from College President Bobby Vagt
and Chaplain Rob Spach.

According to its constitution, the GSA hopes to provide a “safe space for those of diverse gender identity, and all
lesbians, bisexuals, gay people, heterosexual allies and those questioning their sexuality or gender.” The constitution also holds that the GSA
will provide a way for the GSA community to develop a positive self-concept, develop positive relationships, provide advocacy, increase awareness
and acceptance, and facilitate discussion of current issues concerning the community.

To attain these goals, the GSA plans to provide relevant activities and programs on campus and also plans to co-op
with gay and lesbian support groups and churches in Charlotte.

“It’s really important that we provide this space for both gay and straight people to come together,” said Shea. “It’s
a scary thing sometimes, when you live in a place where people do go out and hurt people due to
their sexuality.”

Shea said that Davidson is making huge strides in support of gays on campus. Specifically, RLO and campus security have
stepped up support, and many advertise as supporters of the Human Rights Campaign, an organization that promotes equal rights for
gays, lesbians and bisexuals.

According to Shea, at Davidson, there are fewer than ten students who are officially out. “At Davidson, it’s more reasonable
to estimate that one out of 25 will question their sexuality at some point in their lives,” said Shea. “People
who are questioning usually attend larger schools, like Chapel Hill, where gay support groups are more prominent.”

Shea decided on Davidson because she saw an opportunity to deflate stereotypes. “I knew it would be a challenge,” said
Shea, “but I figured I could take it. And there are a lot of stereotypes to dispel.”

To help her cause, the GSA will sponsor speakers on “Homosexuality and the Legal System” and “Homosexuality and the Church.”
Planned for Oct. 8 and 9, the presentations will include current professionals and an opportunity for audience members to interact
through discussion.

“There’s a large divide of how people reconcile religion or law and homosexuality,” said Shea. “There probably won’t be immediate
solutions, but it’s really important that the differing groups understand each other in a respectful way.”

GSA membership is open to anyone in the college community, and meetings are held at least once per month.

**Saxonhouse Delivers Phi Beta Kappa Lecture**

While reading Platonic dialogues, one must keep in mind the democratic nature of Plato and his underlying implications to the
reader. Such was the main message presented by Dr. Arlene Saxonhouse, professor of political science at the University of Michigan,
who delivered the Phi Beta Kappa Lecture, entitled “The Politics of Reading Plato” on Sept. 27.

Saxonhouse spoke to approximately 40 people, including many professors in the History, Political Science, and Classics departments. A professor at
the University of Michigan since the 1970s, Saxonhouse received her Ph.D. in political science at Yale University and has written
several books on ancient political theory, including *The Birth of Political Science in Ancient Greek Thought*, and *Women in the
History of Political Thought: Ancient Greece to Machiavelli*. A leading dignitary in her field, her current area of study includes
investigations into how ancient political theory contributes to democratic theory and how gender in Plato’s dialogues forms questions on traditional
readings of his political thought.

For an hour in the C. Shaw Smith 900 Room, she discussed Platonic dialogues, drawing examples from numerous classical texts
and citing opinions from other noted professors on the subject. Platonic dialogues, she noted, require a “democratic reading of the
texts.”

Much of the lecture focused on the significance of dialogues and the often hidden intent of Plato and his work
*The Republic*. According to Saxonhouse, every aspect of a dialogue from Plato demands keen attention to detail, form, and meaning.
Early on she cited two styles of dialogue characteristic to Plato’s writings. One, the “dramatic form,” reads like a play,
while in the other form, the narrative, the character begins the dialogue and narrates the entire conversation. Both of these
styles were illustrated with examples from Platonic texts. She continued...Her discussion of dialogue describes how Socrates, one of the main
characters in Plato’s Republic, “makes himself look good in dramatically structured dialogue, whereby the tension comes from the dialogue itself.
He also recites everything, which requires much stamina.” “The audience of the Republic is largely unknown to us, and this
also affects our reading of the dialogue,” according to Saxonhouse. Unfortunately, much of the reading of Plato prior to the
1970s did not pay much attention to dialogue, so the reader lacked a keen “distinction between Socrates and Plato’s words.”
Saxonhouse went on to discuss the views of several leading contemporaries of Plato, then critiqued their opinions. The scenes surrounding
the dialogue also demand attention, she claimed, as they are often overlooked as well. For instance, in the Republic, “given
the wealth of the hosts where the debate took place, the guests did not sit in the dark,” but rather
had candles to shed light on their discussion. From them, shadows were cast throughout the room, similar in fact to
the shadows of Socrates’ famous cave analogy. In many classical texts, “the dialogue creates ambiguity which changes the politics of
the dialogue to egalitarian and democratic.”

Another main theme of the lecture was that of imitation, and the fact that “Socrates, the narrator of the entire
Republic, often speaks through other characters and thus mixes narration with imitation.” With this point, as with all others, Saxonhouse
cited specific examples from the text, even reading selected passages to emphasize her point. “Socrates imitates all characters of the
Republic and becomes all characters he portrays. Because of the mixed narrative, he becomes multifaceted.” In the end, she claimed,
“Because of the narrative style of the Republic and the fact that Socrates is a democratic character, he takes on
multiple roles.” Socrates is comparable to the democratic regime as both deal with issues of multiplicity and struggle to make
choices. Hence, “Plato is not an advocate of a closed society but an author who pushes his readers to democratic
principles of ambiguity.”

**Vandalism Threatens the Return of Red Bikes**

Red Bikes, from page 2

Some bikes will not return to circulation. “Usually, [an irreparable bike] means a bent crank,” Goode lamented. Needless to say,
that kind of damage is not normal “wear and tear.” Alternatively, Hwang and Legerton suggested that use of the red
bikes be restricted to students who register at the beginning of the year. DO would exchange padlocks for the combination
locks and would require interested students to purchase their own keys. Goode speculated that under a “membership” system, “people will
really lock [the community bikes] up.”

Even if the bikes were available on a more limited basis, everyone closely involved with the program agrees that the
real issue is students’ attitudes towards communal property. Goode expressed his belief that “Generally, we treat [the bikes] well, and
they work well for everybody. Every once in a while, someone throws it at something.” SGA Vice President Beth Gardner
’03 was more direct in her critique. “The problem is that when it’s the weekend, [students] think that the Code
of Responsibility doesn’t apply,” she said. Legerton lent support to that notion: “From people who were involved in the vandalism,
[it appears that] the place where most of the damage occurred was on the Court at night.”

Gardner encouraged all senators to emphasize to their constituents the necessity of abiding by the Code of Responsibility and by
the Honor Code. This includes reporting any infractions to the appropriate authorities. Hwang asserted, “It’s not just the people throwing
the bikes off balconies; it’s the people watching the people throwing the bikes off balconies.”

The future of the community bike program remains uncertain. While Harris vowed to have “more discussion” in the SGA until
a solution is found, Goode recognizes another dimension to the problem. Even when the red bikes are repaired, users have
complained about a few “design flaws.” In particular, the handlebars have a tendency to slip forward when the rider puts
pressure on them. The springs under the seat have been known to “pop out” as well. Goode indicated that DO
is working with Evan Kruppenbach from The Wheel to correct those problems. If the red bikes are to ride again,
said Goode, the staff of Davidson Outdoors will have to bring the bikes up to speed, and students will have
to decide “how we as a community treat community property.” Not only will riders have to care for the bikes,
but students will also have to make the extra effort to lock them up and report any abuse.
