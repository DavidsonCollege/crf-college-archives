With Southern Conference Freshman of the Year Suzy Burr returning and a faster, more experienced supporting cast, the women’s cross
country team looks to vault into the upper half of the conference this fall.

“We'd like to finish fourth or fifth in conference. I think fifth’s pretty realistic. We’ve got to work together. Suzy’s
going to be great, but the rest of us have got to stay close to each other and try to
move up closer to her (Burr),” captain Beth Brewster said. “We have solid times far behind hers, and we have
a lot more depth.”

The team opens at Appalachian State next weekend, and coach Beth Puckett says their goals will get more specific after
that. “Right now we want to finish at least sixth, which is up one spot from last year,” she added.

Puckett says there will be a battle for the second spot on the team between Brewster, co-captain Kelly Kiefer, Janet
Aardema, and Allison Curran. Having so many people jockeying for a spot evinces their increased depth. “It’s almost the same
team from last year, but we’re a year stronger. We’ll be better than last year,” Puckett claimed.

The influx of five freshmen, highlighted by Curran, will also help the team. “We have so many more runners than
last year,” Brewster said. “Just the numbers are going to help everybody giving each other support.”

Brewster hopes the team will beat Marshall and ETSU, and doesn’t think knocking off WCU is an unreachable goal. She
also said they can win their sole home meet of the season, Oct. 5 against Campbell, UNCA, Wofford, and Winthrop.
“We ran strong against those teams last year, and we’ll be used to the course and the hills,” she said.
“We hope we can win that meet.”

“If you see us running, try to cheer,” Curran requested.

“We have a lot more speed in the freshman class. The team will definitely have more depth.” - MICHAEL KRUSE

* Roland Williams, Football
Williams, a 5-10, 160-lb. wide receiver and defensive back with extraordinary 4.5 40 speed, comes to Davidson from high school
gridiron hotbed Texas, where he attended Flour Bluff High School in Corpus Christi. Landis labels Williams “a raw talent with
tremendous potential.”

* Kelly Rennick, Women’s Soccer
A midfielder from Herndon, Va., Rennick boasts three-time All-State honors and ODP experience. She started playing at four, but says,
“We should have a good squad this year,” said the Columbia, MD, native. “And if anyone gets a chance to
come out to watch women’s soccer, they should. We're going to be exciting to watch this year.” And Dye’s words
proved prophetic late Sunday afternoon as she pushed the game winner past the Gamecocks goalie, Amanda Sandling (see article on
p. 14). - W.B.

* Gina Lawrence, Volleyball
Lawrence hails from Silverlake, OH where she claimed All-Metro and All-District honors in her senior season. The 6’1” Allison Curran,
Women’s Cross Country; an all-league performer in Ho-ho-kus, NJ, Curran is looking to “have a lot of fun and improve
a lot” this season. Coach Beth Puckett says, “to watch her run you wouldn’t think she was good, but she
really gets out and goes.” - W.B.
