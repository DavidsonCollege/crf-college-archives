Dear Sir, —Please accept my thanks for the Stieff Grand Piano which you furnished for my Recital at the Academy of Music last night. Truly, it is an instrument of wonderful sweetness of tone, which is so satisfying and essential to accompanists.
Sincerely,
(Signed) BIANCA RANDALL

IMPROVEMENTS AND POLITICS.

The Davidson townspeople are beginning to put the town in a condition to ensure good health during the summer. Wednesday, April 14, was clean-up day. Everybody cleaned the backyards of tin cans and other refuse, the material being placed outside the street and hauled out at the expense of the town. Saturday is the regular day for cleaning the streets. On that day all refuse is removed from the streets. Another feature of Davidson’s civic improvement is the fight that is being waged against the fly this spring. The stores have all agreed to screen their doors. Indeed, everybody is interested in town improvements so that Davidson is in a fair way to become a flyless and feverless town.

The people of Davidson are also at present turning their attention toward town politics. Mayor Sloan has called a mass meeting of the citizens to outline the program for the election to be held the first Monday in May. There will probably be three candidates for the office.Mrs. T. W. Lingle, Mrs. J. R. Withers, Mrs. Frank Knox, and Mrs. Brady. Mrs. A. Currie attended the inauguration of President Graham at Chapel Hill last Wednesday.

Dr. Lingle will give his address, "Germany, at War and at Peace," before the Normal and Industrial Institute at Albemarle, on May 1. The following day he will preach the Commencement Sermon of the Norwood High School.

Dr. Edward Currie visited his mother here last week. Mrs. Martin, who has been visiting her sisters in Fayetteville and Red Springs, returned last week.

The Charlotte churches have invited the Faculty and Student Body of Davidson to attend the Chapman-Alexander meetings next Wednesday, when a special train will be run, leaving Davidson at 1 p.m. The returning train will leave at 10 p.m. All students who wish to do so may attend.

Mr. F. Johnson is the only one who has declared himself as a candidate for the office of mayor. It is probable that the old aldermen will be re-elected.
