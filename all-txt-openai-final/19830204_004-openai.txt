#### POC and SGA Begin Self-Selection Study

#### SGA Surveys Other Schools

By DAVID RESNIK '85

The SGA’s Patterson Court Study Committee is examining Davidson’s self-selection system.

“There is a feeling on campus and within the SGA,” said Committee Chairman Warren Gould ’85, “that there is something wrong with the [self-selection] system.”

The Committee has sent out surveys to the SGA presidents of thirty schools that are similar to Davidson in size but who have different social arrangements. The surveys ask students to evaluate their own social systems.

Some of the schools the SGA has contacted include Bucknell, Duke, Princeton, University of the South, Stanford, and Williams.

After self-selection, the committee will interview hall counselors and the presidents and rush chairmen of the Patterson Court houses and off-campus fraternities.

The Committee will compare our system with the others they have studied and “will come to some conclusion,” according to Gould.

If the committee decides to propose another system, says Gould, they will present the proposal to the campus at large by means of an SGA referendum.

The SGA formed the Patterson Court Study Committee at the beginning of the school year. The P.C.S.C. meets every Tuesday.

The committee consists of Burt Taylor '84, Minor Hinson '84, Pete Skillern ’85, Pat Woodward ’84, Beadsie Woo ’86, and Keith Revell ’85, but its meetings are open to all students.

Until now, the committee has not consulted the Patterson Court Council. Next week, however, a member of the P.C.C. will join the P.C.S.C. (see related story).

Gould would like to “start cooperating more with the P.C.C.” because a joint decision would “carry more weight.”

#### Faculty Changes in Math and Sciences

By PAULETTE KURANI ’86

Several changes will occur among Science Department faculty next year: one professor is retiring, and four others are going on sabbatical.

Mathematics Professor Richard R. Bernard will retire at the end of this academic year after approximately 40 years in education. Dr. Bernard, who has been at Davidson College since 1955, will continue living in Davidson although he plans to spend half of his time at his other home in Brevard, N.C.

“I will certainly miss teaching,” he said, “but the time has come for me to stop.”

He plans to use his free hours fishing and “learning about the field of computing and art.”

Dr. Bernard will be replaced by a temporary professor next year while the Math Department searches for a suitable permanent applicant to fill the position in 1984. Chairman of the Math Department R. Bruce Jackson said that it will require a whole year to find a qualified candidate.

“Versatility in mathematics is a very important criteria for applicants,” commented Dr. Jackson.

Associate Dean of the Faculty and Chairman of the Chemistry Department J.N. Burnett left this week for his spring sabbatical. He plans to research the study of historical development of science technology at Princeton University and then at Indiana University in April. Dr. Burnett will be back at Davidson College for fall term next year.

Associate Professor of Chemistry Rodger Nutt also plans a sabbatical. He will be absent all next year but his destination and project are still undecided. Dr. Nutt is presently the acting Chairman of the Chemistry Department while Dr. Burnett is away.

Associate Professor of Chemistry Merlyn Schuh is currently on sabbatical and will be returning next fall. He is involved in photochemical research at Syracuse University.

Associate Professor of Physics and Professor of Humanities Robert J. Manning leaves on his sabbatical this spring term. His interest in art history will lead him and his family to the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., the National Gallery, and London, England. Dr. Manning will conduct research for a historical paper describing the influences of Nicolaus Copernicus on sixteenth-century art. His essay, “Durer’s Melancholia I: A Copernican Interpretation,” will be published this spring in Soundings, the Journal for the Society for Values in Higher Education.

There will be no changes in the Biology Department next year.

The Patterson Court Council’s Committee on House Selection began studying self-selection two weeks ago.

The committee will try to “come up with a proposal that is acceptable to most of the houses on Patterson Court,” according to chairman Ken Krieg ’83.

Krieg says the committee is “not shooting to get the Trustees to review it [self-selection] this spring”; he thinks the main problem is that “the whole system needs to be defined.”

“No one can tell you exactly what goes on,” said Krieg. “The problem with oral discouragement” is that “no one really knows what oral discouragement is.”

“The system as it is written is not necessarily the one that operates,” he said.

The committee has “aired some broad ideas” says Krieg, “but it’s still too early to tell” what the committee will do.

Besides defining the system, the committee’s major purpose will be to “get something down on paper,” according to Krieg.

“Every year since I’ve been here the issue of self-selection has come up,” he said, “but the people change every year and we have to start over from scratch.”

Krieg wants his committee to work with the SGA’s Patterson Court Study Committee (see related story); he realizes that “any major changes will take a unified effort.”

Self-selection proposals must be submitted to the Council on Campus and Religious Life. Any organization representing the entire student body may submit a proposal.

The CCRL presents student proposals to the College President who must approve proposals before submitting them to the Trustees at their next meeting. The Trustees have final authority on all College decisions.

A representative member of each eating house is on the House Selection Committee.
