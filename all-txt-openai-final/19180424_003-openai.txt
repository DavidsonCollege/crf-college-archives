SATURDAY NIGHT MEETING.

In the regular meeting of the Phi Society the query for the debate was, “Resolved, That Congress be given a
freer hand in the conduct of the war.”

The affirmative was represented by Messrs. T. N. Morton and T. Spence. This was the fourth successive appearance of Spence
before the society, and his speech was another proof of the axiom that practice makes perfect. Keep on practicing.

For the negative, G. McDonald stated that there were fifteen reasons why Congress should not be given more power, but
that he would only elaborate on one point. The elaboration took exactly three minutes, but, by the way, Mac, what
was the point? L. I. Wilson was the other defender of the present regime.

H. V. Lilly gave a very interesting oration on “The Manufacture of Shoes.” C. G. Long gave an excellent declamation
entitled, “Under the Southern Flag.”

The subject for the extemporaneous debate was, “Resolved, That drill should be continued through exams.” The subject being one of
such vital interest to so many students caused excellent attention. The debaters both waxed eloquent over the subject, giving the
society a treat in oratory. T. R. Alexander spoke on the affirmative and S. M. Davis was frequently applauded for
his views on the negative side of the question.

Subject for debate Saturday, April 20, was, “Resolved, That Congress should be given a freer hand in the conduct of
the war.” The affirmative, composed of Love, McCaskill and McCloy, Jr., argued: First, not to give Congress a freer hand
means to centralize the power and to make the government more autocratic rather than democratic. Secondly, to give Congress a
freer hand is a more efficient way than to entrust it all to one man.

The negative, represented by Matthews, McPheeters and Dendy, argued: First, giving Congress more power would impair unity. Secondly, giving Congress
more power would weaken our national power.

Mitchell gave a declamation entitled, “The March of the Flag.” Craig gave a part of “The President's Flag Day Address.”
Liston rendered, “Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address.”

HART WINS ESSAY MEDAL.

O. P. Hart has been declared winner in the Essayists’ Contest in the Philanthropic Society. His subject was “Wanted: A
Man.” While the thing wanted is not of the sex most to be desired, still Hart expressed himself well enough
to obtain the honor of the medal. Dr. Wauchope, of the University of South Carolina, acted as judge. R. H.
Stone won second place and D. M. Chalmers, third.

George King spent the latter part of last week in the Infirmary with tonsillitis. He is out again, however, and
will be able to get back into the line-up this week.
