PI KAPPA PHI

The “O” Club held its weekly banquet last Saturday night with Bob as master of ceremonies and Carlos Gragg furnishing the entertainment. The brothers present were Dean and Mrs. Bailey, Mr. and Mrs. Payne, Mr. and Mrs. Lacy McLean, Dr. Cumming, Wylie Smith, Furman McGavock, and Dr. C. M. Richards, professor emeritus and father of the honor guest. Brother Saxon was in charge of the affair.

The Fijis sincerely hope that all readers have missed the Phi Gam column in THE DAVIDSONIAN since our journalist was on a rush. The “J. D.” Club was present and near the end of the banquet petitioned him to furnish a report, but due to prevailing circumstances, this petition could not be granted.

Another man who has been trying to get the fellows to stop “feeding and smoking” is Coach Bob Flowers, who is trying to get the squad in shape for the inter-frat track meet coming up. Brother Preyer is sweating it out at spring practice, and “Kolby” is despairingly trying to throw off six pounds for the wrestling match with VMI Saturday.

Thoughts have been turned to the coming spring function—just when nobody is quite sure, but it's as definite as a young man's fancy. It was also quite inspiring to know that tennis season is here and that “Rackets” Robinson, in all probability, will be making a trip or two.

Claude Higginbotham, F. B. Hunter, Bill Moore, Jack Barringer, Clayton Carpenter, Marion Murray, George Barksdale, John Coble, Bill Cassels, and one or two others kept the homefires burning. Thad Barringer went to the great city of Florence; Dot of the Peroxide Pals (Dietrick and Whitamore) to Rockingham, and Brother Coak, accompanied by one of the “J. D.” Club, represented the club at the national convention held in Spartanburg Saturday afternoon.

A new precedent has been set at Queens College by none other than Hub Edwards. Bud Lander and Billy Ann Houck went down to Converse College for the big Converse dance. Billy Ann, more infamously known as the Roanoke Road Runner, and Bud created a mild sensation among the fairer sex at Peace College, while the activities of “Hormones” at W. C. were even less successful.

The Pikas can be divided into two groups in regard to the past week-end—those who did and those who didn’t. The former are Big Jim Siske, P. K. Gordon Scott, Randy Ensign, Bill Cumming, Chester Nelly, Jack Fanjoy, and Charlie Dockery. Yours truly played, eclipsing the head leads. The latter group or this article most assuredly would not have been written. The aforementioned Siske, having been duped by a certain young lady, will not be available for several days as she accumulated a number of majors for this minor offense. The question now is, will this precedent stand or be broken?

SIGMA CHI

Following our motto of “equal opportunity,” we leave you with this comforting thought: when you have a cold, do as thousands of others do—SNEEZE!

Pledges Tultan and Tatum journeyed to Winthrop this week-end—result: mighty cool. Better luck next time. Brother “Don Juan Tenafio” West and his devoted protege, C. Mitchell, turned our sister college into a public relations center. The question of the week is devoted to Carl Pahl, who for reasons beyond our understanding journeyed to Charlotte and dated Mary Street. What happened to the answer?
