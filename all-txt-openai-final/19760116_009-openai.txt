The Davidson Wildcats won their first conference match Tuesday in a 77-68 victory over the Paladins of Furman. This contest was a crucial one for both teams, as both are in the middle of a rebuilding year and are seeking to make a turnaround. Going into this game, each team only had three victories; Davidson had nine losses to Furman’s seven.

The Wildcats came out ready to play and to display their improvement. Davidson forged to an early 27-19 lead on a Jay Powell jump shot with 7:43 left in the first half. The Wildcats hit on 51.7% of their shots in the first twenty minutes, but the shooting and rebounding of Furman’s Ray Miller, who had 17 points and 10 rebounds at halftime, pulled the Paladins to a 35-33 lead at the halfway mark.

Davidson finally put both shooting and rebounding together in the final period, and the Wildcats actually surged.

An interview with COACH BO BRICKELS  
By BRUCE HOLLIDAY  
Assistant Sports Editor

In a recent interview, I asked Coach Bo Brickels a number of pertinent questions about his coaching methods and about the team in general. Here are my questions and his replies:

**Question:** Coach Brickels, it has been a disappointing season for the fans so far and many of them are beginning to question why things have gotten off to such a slow start.

**Brickels:** You've got to realize that if you’re 9-3 they aren’t asking too many questions--that’s the way it works.

**Q:** To begin with, many people feel that you have played the freshmen too much and that the team’s lack of experience is reflected in our record.

**B:** We play the freshmen because we think they are the best players. We go with the people we feel we have the best opportunity to win with. Also, we are in a situation where we have to play the freshmen. Maybe we rushed a couple of them but we’ve backed off a little now.

**Q:** But why aren’t Kevin Doherty and Tom Verlin playing more?

**B:** Both, of course, missed some early work and consequently got themselves behind. Kevin is probably the most talented athlete we have now but the one quality that Kevin suffers from, I think, is gamesmanship--knowledge of the game. I realize that the only way you can get that sort of thing is through playing experience if indeed you can ever learn that sort of thing. He’s not real sure offensively...what to do, when to take it to the basket, when to pass it off. The very reasons Tom Jorganson played so much earlier are the reasons K.D. doesn’t always play a lot. Defensively, Kevin is fine and there are times when I think he can play. But in situations like against the zone...that takes care of Kevin. Tom Verlin suffered from a weight problem and got it down before Christmas and he played 11 minutes against Ohio State and ten.against Georgia Tech. But when he came back from Christmas break, he was overweight again. He weighs 211 pounds, and he’s supposed to weigh 193 pounds. You say we need his talent, and you’re damn right we need his talent—and his experience—but you’ve got to draw the line somewhere. It’s not a matter of ability or putting out or attitude in either case.

Q: It’s often been said that a person with more experience will beat a talented player.

B: I think that that’s a good point. As everyone knows, experience is invaluable. We badly need the experience that Verlin can give us, but because of pure talent, you must find a way to develop that experience in the more talented individuals.

Q: Because you play the freshmen so much, many people have begun to accuse you of forgetting this season in order to prepare for the future.

B: I don’t think that is true—we play to win. I’d like to have done a little better, sure, but for all intents and purposes, our season is in the next three games. We’re not sure that right now we aren't the second-best team in the conference.

Q: Watching practices, it seems that instead of constructive criticism, you offer only pure criticism. Wouldn’t enough of this criticism tend to discourage the players?

to a 13-point lead, 65-52, after guard Tom Jorgenson glided in on consecutive layups with 6:37 left in the contest. Not to be undone, the Paladins slowly crawled back to within three points with only 1:29 left until Jim Rice sank a crucial free throw and Powell added five insurance points in the last 33 seconds. His layup at the buzzer settled the Davidson victory margin at nine points. The Wildcats connected on 34 of 62 shots, a steady 54.6% pace, while the Paladins hit only 38.6% of their attempts. Jay Powell led the Davidson scoring with 15 points, while Eppa Rixey had 14, and John Gerdy and Tom Dore both had 10. Dore was also the Wildcats’ top rebounder with 6. Furman was led by Ray Miller, who netted a game-high 30 points while pulling down 15 rebounds. Freshman center Jim Strickland scored 18 points, and he had 11 rebounds. Steve Whittington added 10 points for the losers. The Wildcats are now 1-2 in conference and 4-9 overall. They travel to Richmond Saturday to play the University of Richmond at 2 p.m.
