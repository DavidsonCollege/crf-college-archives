UNC-Greensboro

Even with four players in double figures, the Davidson Wildcats could not pull out a victory against UNCG Thursday night
in Belk Arena, falling 84-73 to the number one-ranked team in the Southern Conference. The ’Cats sprang to an early
lead with a three-point basket by senior forward Bethany Schott, but slowed their scoring to a near halt until the
10:50 mark with a basket by sophomore center Meghan Bryant to bring them to within five. Davidson had little problem
with Greensboro’s press, but could not manage to stay out of foul trouble, allowing UNCG 12 free looks at the
basket in the first half compared to Davidson’s 5, and could not connect on easy lay-ups. The Spartans also utilized
their inside-outside offensive threats effectively, allowing them to widen the scoring gap around the seven-minute mark. However, the well-known and
deeply respected heart of the Wildcats kept beating (and if you’re reading this, clap your hands), and a three-point basket
by senior guard Janna Magette at the 1:18 mark brought the ’Cats to within five. Freshman forward Emily Callahan tied
the game with an impressive three-point play the old-fashioned way with 6 seconds left, and allowed Davidson to carry the
momentum into the locker room, even at 30.

The ’Cats stayed tough in the opening two minutes of the second half, up 35-32 with 18:12 to go, but
the Spartans dished out seven straight points as Davidson’s baskets began to rim in and out. Once again though, the
’Cats would not give up, and Magette and Schott answered with five points of their own. Play went back and
forth between the two teams, but UNCG’s 61.3 floor percentage and 50% from behind the arc allowed them an insurmountable
lead. A three-point basket from Schott brought the ’Cats to within 6 with 3:17 to go, still keeping hope alive.
Davidson began to foul the Spartans, but UNCG’s impressive 6-7 free throw shooting down the stretch proved too much for
the ’Cats. Schott led all scorers with 27 points.

Despite only a two-point deficit at halftime, the Wildcats dropped their sixth straight loss to conference rival UTC 83-61 on
Saturday in Belk Arena. A little shaky after an emotional senior day presentation for Kelly Copland, D’Erica Taylor, and Janna
Magette, the ’Cats missed two early lay-ups and scored only four points in the first four minutes of play. The
Lady Mocs’ intense man defense frustrated Davidson and forced them out of their rhythm and into taking low-percentage shots. But
the ’Cats settled down and began to attack the basket, as sophomore center Meghan Bryant snagged the offensive board and
put-back at the 9:15 mark to bring the ’Cats to within four, 23-19. A steal and basket by freshman guard
Joy Newsome inched Davidson to within one with 7:11 to go. Point guard Ashley Hallsted stole the show in the
remaining minutes of the first half as she blew past Lady Moc defenders, creating shots for herself and for her
teammates. As devoted supporter Joey Bass ’05 remarked, “UTC just did not have an answer for Ashley in the first
half.” The combination of Hallsted’s drives and the team’s hustle brought the ’Cats to within two.

717-337-659836-34, at halftime. Unfortunately, the second half was not as promising for Davidson. According to sophomore forward Courtney Laird, Davidson
just “came out so cold in the first part of the second half, and dug a hole that we could
not get out of.” The ’Cats brought the lead back down to nine with 12:45 to go, but calls in
favor of UTC and an impressive 26 attempts from the charity stripe stopped short any chance of a Davidson comeback.
Looking tired and sloppy in the last seven minutes, the ’Cats fell further and further into the “hole,” down by
as much as 27 at one point. Bryant led Davidson scorers with 12 points and recorded a game-high 16 rebounds.

In their last home game of the season, the ’Cats upset third-ranked conference rival Georgia Southern (12-13) on Monday night,
69-57. Clawing back from a 9-0 deficit and a scoreless opening four minutes, all ten healthy Davidson players saw action
against the Lady Eagles and left them stunned when the final buzzer sounded. As sophomore guard Robyn Flewelling noted, “Coach
Watts was just really excited that we ended our losing streak and played such a solid game.” The ’Cats recovered
from the shaky start and caught the Lady Eagles at the 14:06 mark with a three-point play by senior guard
Janna Magette. A three by Magette a minute later merited a Southern timeout and put the ’Cats up by three,
13-10. Sloppy play ensued for the next couple of minutes, with the Lady Eagles forcing Davidson to use all of
the shot clock before even taking the first shot. A basket by freshman guard Joy Newsome with 8:08 to go
put Davidson back up by one, 21-20. The ’Cats never lost the lead again and entered halftime up by three,
31-28.

While both teams played relatively equally in the first half, Davidson emerged from the locker room looking stronger, tougher, and
more in control for the second half of play. “We came into the locker room at halftime and just decided
that this time we were going to finish what we had started,” remarked sophomore forward Courtney Laird. The two teams
exchanged baskets for the first two minutes of the half, but a 5-0 run by the ’Cats forced a Southern
timeout with 16:40 to go and put Davidson up by ten, 42-32. Unlike the uneven first half foul situation, with
the Lady Eagles reaching the charity stripe 12 times in comparison to Davidson’s 3, the second half saw a complete
turn of events. The ’Cats began to attack the basket more, and, in one possession, forced three Southern fouls, all
allowing Davidson to reach the foul line 18 times in the half. The Lady Eagles made a slight run in
the closing minutes of the game, bringing a 13-point lead back down to 9 around the four-minute mark, but they
couldn’t make key free throws, shooting a miserable 46.2% from the line in the second half. Ashley Hallsted led all
scorers with 19 points and was helped by 14 points and 7 assists from Magette, and another 14 points and
10 rebounds from Bryant.
