In the last decade, the number of courses has stayed about the same. "We have increased, but we have not increased the number of courses we're offering," said Terry. Terry was quick to point out that the fall term add-drop period, which ended Tuesday with an estimated 2500 course transactions having been made, actually went much smoother than last spring’s. He explained that many professors take their sabbaticals in the spring and others take small groups of Davidson students abroad as part of the College's programs. This reduces the number of available courses even further, of course, and visits chaos upon the Registrar’s office during add-drop, according to Terry.

Zimmermann said he wants to avert a possible bottleneck this spring but is not yet sure what actions he will take. "We're still studying the problems," he said. Some of the things which he has already done include moving classes to 1 p.m., when most upperclassmen are eating, so that the rest of the class day will be less crowded by courses. A computer print-out in Burts’ office clearly shows that many students do not get the courses they want, not because the courses are filled up, but because there are time conflicts with another class the student has already received. To Burts, this is both one of the major problems in the system and potentially the easiest to correct.

To prove his point, Burts cited a recent building utilization study done among North Carolina colleges which showed Davidson getting the least good from its facilities. In recent years, he said, most classes have met at 9 and 11 a.m. and their rooms have often been left empty the rest of the day. To remedy the situation, Burts said he has asked, in writing, all department chairmen to hold some of their classes in the afternoon. Burts said traditionally there has been an unwritten rule against scheduling classes in the afternoon, due to possible conflicts with science labs, and that for this and other reasons, many department chairmen failed to comply. But he argued that now two-thirds of the students do not even have labs during a given term. "There’s an attitude that says you have to keep the afternoon free for labs. For one-third of the students that’s true; for two-thirds of the students it’s not true," said Burts.

More courses are scheduled in the afternoon this term, according to the registration print-out, but Burts said only one is scheduled in such a way that it is still possible for its students to take a lab course. Economics Professor Charles Ratliff is teaching an introductory course (Eco 101) three times a week.

SALISBURY, Rhodesia: As a reaction to the guerilla slaying of 10 plane crash victims, Rhodesian President Adam Smith declared martial rule and delayed progress towards black majority rule. Sources report many whites are fleeing as guerillas control one-third of the country.

MANAGUA, Nicaragua: In Nicaragua, General Somoza’s regime is threatened by civil war as leftist rebels continue fighting. If Somoza is defeated, the vacuum could be filled by Marxists, providing an example for other South American nations.

CAMP DAVID, Maryland: The Camp David summit has moved into the operative stage as three-way meetings begin between Egyptian, Israeli, and U.S. foreign ministers. Despite its publicity, the meetings thus far have yielded little progress towards a settlement.

NEW YORK, N.Y.: The dollar continues to climb against foreign currency as the Federal Reserve tightens the money supply by raising the prime lending rate to 8 and three-eighth percent from eight and one-quarter on federal funds.

WASHINGTON, D.C.: It is predicted that Nancy Teeters, a nominee for the Federal Reserve Board and a pragmatic liberal, will be confirmed by the Senate this week.

WASHINGTON, D.C.: The House last week sustained Carter's veto of the defense bill, marking a legislative victory for the administration and the first defense cut in 100 years.D.C.: The administration has developed a set of wage-price guidelines to strengthen its anti-inflation efforts.

Terry calls for more courses to ease crowding days a week in the afternoon, an hour-and-a-half at a stretch each session. Conceivably, his students can take a science course with a Monday lab. Although he originally described the course to the paper as “an experiment,” Ratliff has begun to see real advantages in it. In the first place, he said it allows students to have more time for his material to sink in and, secondly, they have longer to take his tests. Burts said he hoped other professors would adopt similar schedules. But even if they do, there will still be a big registration problem left unsolved. It is a matter of flippant student attitudes, he observed. Burts said some students get through the initial registration period, then tire of different things and entirely drop-add. Burts said when he talked to some of them it became obvious they were not serious about their courses. This clogs up the whole process, he said, and sometimes keeps those students who are serious from getting their courses. But whatever combination of factors contribute to registration difficulties, it is quite clear that nobody gets everything they want all the time. The computer rejected 109 people who wanted to take Clark’s New Testament Faith during this term; 107 who wanted Cornell’s Drama 31; 98 who wanted Shi’s United States History 1865 to 1921; 90 who reported to their state headquarters on the needs of North Carolina most of their courses during the term.

At a glance

A plea for aid

The first issue of Davidson’s nascent literary magazine, which has yet to be named, will hit the dorm room doorsteps in late October or early November if its three editors have their way. Lyman Collins, Amanda Hall, and Greg Hankins said they encourage everyone who is interested in writing poetry or short stories, taking pictures or drawing, designing magazine layout, or even writing book reviews and editorials to come to their meeting this Thursday at 4 p.m. in the Morrison Room. And you don’t have to be Shakespeare or even J.D. Salinger to contribute. “Our magazine seeks to give exposure to the Davidson writer who might not otherwise get published,” said Collins.

PIRG issues study

During the summer Davidson PIRG members submitted a report on status offenders. Status offenders, according to Davidson PIRG Chairman Chuck Gaddy, are children guilty of violating laws inapplicable to adults. Running away, truancy, and disobedience are examples of status offenses. The report was written in response to North Carolina House Bill 456 which provided funds for “the development of community-based alternatives to training school commitment.” The law became effective July 1, 1978. PIRG’s analysis, published in June and available nationwide, forwarded several suggestions outlining methods of treatment proven to aid in the rehabilitation of status offenders. The suggestions included: One to One Programs, Group Homes, Emergency Shelter Care, Camping and Recreation Activities, and School-Based Programs. Each modality is explained in detail and already existing programs are cited. The report, according to Gaddy, also includes statistics about status offenders in North Carolina gathered from juvenile courts, and evaluations of 3500 status offenders. The Mecklenburg County Juvenile Services Division has jurisdiction in the Davidson area. Gaddy commented that results will not be expected for some time due to the bill’s recent date of enactment.

SGA seeks two

The SGA is seeking two students interested in serving on the Media Board, an organization composed of students and members of the administration which is responsible for setting guidelines of general policy for the conduct of all the media of the College (WDAV, The Davidsonian, Quips and Cranks, Miscellany, etc.). According to the SGA, the Media Board acts in an advisory capacity in the event of questions or disputes within its jurisdiction. In addition, the SGA will be appointing one student to the International Studies Committee, which aids the College in the implementation of its international studies program. Register in the Dean of Students’ Office or contact Bruce Brown (-6112) before 5 p.m. Monday.
