**Sacrifices Recalled On Veteran’s Day**

Davidsonian Staff Writer By BILL HELLIER

“Let Learning Be Cherished Where Liberty Has Arisen.” Though most Davidson students are quick to recognize the preceding words as
their school’s motto, few realize that many Davidson Alumni personally have paid dearly for this liberty. On Tuesday, November 11th,
Americans will observe Veteran’s Day in memory of those who have fought for our country’s freedom. Davidson in particular is
able to look with pride at the record of her men who have served in this country’s Armed Forces during
wartime. Of the 2640 alumni who entered the Second World War, 1503 were commissioned as officers in one of the
branches of service. In more than a few cases the officers and enlisted personnel from this school showed outstanding bravery,
with 256 Davidson men receiving a total of 776 decorations, including a Congressional Medal of Honor Award. During World War
II, 159 men lost their lives, including Lieutenant H. M. “Jimmy” Fulcher, Jr., son of Professor Fulcher of the present
Physics department. Two brothers, Lieutenant Edward T. Erwin and Captain Phifer Erwin, in whose honor Erwin Lodge was presented by
their parents, Dr. E. T. Erwin, former Davidson English professor, and his wife, also lost their lives during this conflict.
Captain Erwin was killed in the crash of a B-49 bomber in January 1945, and Lieutenant Erwin died a few
weeks later from injuries received in action on the island of Luzon. Among the 234 wounded during this war is
Lieutenant Edward B. Hibbs, whose action is typical of the courage exhibited by these men. Under fire from enemy rifles
and machine guns, Lieutenant Hibbs accomplished the removal of forty live enemy mines, carrying them out of the path of
a tank and infantry advancement. He was wounded later that same day and was awarded the Silver Star for his
outstanding actions.

The rank of General Officer has been attained by ten Davidson Alumni. Nine of these men were Brigadier Generals, four
of whom are retired, and Brooke E. Allen is presently a Major General in the Air Force. After consideration of
the sacrifices made by those who have been here before him, the Davidson student would do well to pause this
November 11th and realize that his opportunity for learning at Davidson College has cost a great deal more than the
money he pays every year. Our predecessors have made a priceless “down-payment” on our freedom, and we cannot afford to
use this freedom unwisely.

“The inheritance of a fine thing automatically imposes an obligation on the beneficiary. You are obligated as a Davidson student
to govern yourself in accordance with the Davidson tradition. You are obligated to the future also; for the sake of
the men who come after you, keep the tradition of student government strong, improve upon it, leave it in even
finer shape for the next college generation.” These are the words of Samuel R. Spencer, Jr., as he spoke in
Chapel on the morning of March 22, 1946. His words stand as a challenge for the upholding of a Davidson
tradition that has evolved since its birth at the turn of the century.

**ARCHIBALD CURRIE**

Student Government at Davidson, from the opening of the college up to the election of Archibald Currie as the first
student body president, was by the class system. Class spirit and unity ran high. Such oneness was necessary in the
face of possible hazing or even annihilation by the respective classes. If disciplinary action became necessary, the class president called
a meeting of the class, and as an entire group, the action to be taken was decided. During this period,
two students brought a five-gallon jug of whisky up to the third floor of Old Chambers and offered drinks to
all who passed at a nominal price. History has it recorded that they departed shortly afterwards. In 1896, Archibald Currie
was elected the first President of the Student Body. The generations of students from 1896 until 1910 still stayed close
to the old class system. The dangers of hazing kept this system alive and is credited by Miss Cornelia Shaw
in her history of Davidson as the beginning of our real student government. Hazing became so bad that the students
finally agreed on September 6, 1909, to settle the problem once and for all.

**NEW ERA**

Miss Shaw says: “The action of September 6th marked the beginning of a new era at Davidson College — though
not to be of long life. The releasing of scores of immature students from the restraint formerly exercised by their
fear seemed to lead to more noise and disturbance. After a full conference with the president of the college, the
students decided in the spring of that year (1910) to adopt a system of self-government that would protect domestic comfort,
secure quiet and good order for the campus and dormitories, and regulate any conduct of students, individually or through student
organizations, that affected the health or reputation of the student body. To carry the new system into effect, the student
council was organized.”

In the spring of 1910, a rising senior, the future father of Davidson student government as we know it, was
elected president of the student body. C. R. Wilcox set up the student council and made it work as an
important part of student life. The student government constitution that we have today is the product of much revision since
its origin during the term of Wilcox. In 1915, Justice Frasier, a Davidson alumnus and an associate justice of the
South Carolina Supreme Court, aided in the revision of the then adopted constitution. Since that time, numerous changes have been
made, as deemed necessary to cope with the government of our growing community.

**‘Davidsonian’ Wins National Award**

The fourth consecutive All-American rating has been awarded to the DAVIDSONIAN by the critical service of the University of Minnesota.
Of 45 college weekly newspapers in the 750-1400 enrollment bracket, seven received this highest rating. The critique from the University
of Minnesota mentioned particular strengths. The coverage of President Martin's election by the Trustees last spring was cited as “outstanding.”
On creativeness, the service commented that the “staff deserves recognition.” Comments were also made about the various sections. Features were
hailed as “a pleasure to read.” The critic considered the editorial “a strong point.” The sports section is said to
not “miss a trick” in its presentation. The entire staff was said to “excel in writing.” Editorial make-up was rated
the “best of the best.” The awards are presented for a semester period of publication. This fourth consecutive All-American rating
covered the second semester of last year, giving the DAVIDSONIAN an All-American rank for the past two years.

**Board Of Visitors Holds Third Annual Meeting**

Members of the 1958 College Board of Visitors assembled on campus today for the third annual meeting of the group,
which was organized in 1956 to aid Davidson in adding to its stature as an outstanding Christian liberal arts college.
The visitors, approximately forty in number, were to concentrate their attention on Davidson's curriculum, student activities, and program of long-term
development. The board serves the college in an advisory capacity as contrasted to the trustees’ purpose of formulating the legislative
policy of the institution. Included on today’s agenda were reports and discussions of Davidson's present and future plans by President
D. Grier Martin, Dr. Johnston, Acting Dean of Faculty, and other college officials. The student government constitution that we have
today is the product of much revision since its origin during the term of Wilcox. In 1915, Justice Frasier, a
Davidson alumnus and an associate justice of the South Carolina Supreme Court, aided in the revision of the then adopted
constitution. Since that time, numerous changes have been made, as deemed necessary to cope with the government of our growing
community.

**ANDERSON BRUBAKER**

They were chosen, as were the other visitors, on the basis of outstanding leadership and achievement in the fields of
business, civic, educational, professional, and church life. The newly elected members are: Dr. James Phinney Baxter, president of Williams College,
Williamstown, Mass.; Thomas M. Belk, executive vice president, Belk Stores Service, Inc., Charlotte; Dr. Lauchlin M. Currie, president, Union Carbide
Nuclear Company, New York City; Harry L. Dalton, vice chairman of the board, American Viscose Company, Philadelphia, Pa.; and Dr.
W. C. Davison, dean of the Duke University Medical School, Durham. Others include: Dr. William Friday, president, University of North
Carolina, Chapel Hill; Huger S. King, business executive and former, Greensboro; Dr. Thor Johnson, former conductor of the Cincinnati Symphony.

The PMLA contains an article by Dr. George B. Watts of the French Department. The title of Dr. Watts’ article
is the Encyclopédie Méthodique. This is a study on the history of the publication of the 202-volume work, which has
been called by the French book-trade "the most extensive collection ever produced," followed by an analysis of the individual numbers
and a list of its constituent elements. Work on this study was completed at Harvard University during the summer of
1957, when Dr. Watts was a recipient of a Davidson College grant for research and writing.

On November 13 and 14, the Red and Black Masquers will open the season with a production of Henrik Ibsen's
famous social drama, “Ghosts.” The story concerns a Norwegian family, the Albings. To the casual observer, the family is wealthy
and respectable; but this illusion soon fades, and it is portrayed as worm-eaten, rotten to the very core. When Oswald
Albing (George Kemmerer), a young artist, returns from Paris, a grand holiday appears imminent. However, a series of tragedies befall
the family, during which Mrs. Albing (Miss Miriam Seawell) is forced to reveal her family's secrets, and the holiday becomes
a nightmare. The scandalous facts disclosed involve not only the Albings but also their self-righteous priest (Warren Womble), the gay,
spirited housemaid (Mrs. Sandra Goodwin), and the gruff gardener (George Johnson). From this start, the plot builds up to an
almost unbearable climax, which has left many an audience speechless.

The topic of the play is delicate, so much so that it was banned from the stages of Europe for
years. Even today, seventy-five years later, the topic is still touchy and no less important. Ray Atkinson, director of the
production, has this to say about the play: “This play, Ibsen's most widely read and most controversial, represents an attempt
by Davidson’s drama group to present to Davidson and the public a profound, mature drama instead of the usual contemporary
play. The electrifying last sixty seconds of the final act cannot be equaled in theater history for sheer dramatic force.
The Red and Black Masquers this year have the best organization, most interest, and best financial support of any year
so far. In this light, and with the play we are working with, there is no reason why we shouldn't
have our best season this year.”

Thanksgiving Trip

New York is the destination of a bus chartered by Davidson and Queens for the Thanksgiving holidays. The bus is
tentatively scheduled to leave after supper on Wednesday, November 26, and return late Sunday night. The approximate cost for the
bus and the room will be thirty dollars. The party will be housed in the Hotel Plymouth by Radio City.
Vacancies for Davidson students are still open. Anyone interested in going on this trip may contact Ralph Bright at the
Union desk any afternoon.

ODK Leadership Society Makes Chapel Appeal

Donald Russell: “No Man Is An Island”

On Tuesday, November 4, Dr. Donald Russell, President of the University of South Carolina from 1951 to 1957 and gubernatorial
candidate in 1958, addressed the student body in chapel. Dr. Russell, presently practicing law in Spartanburg, S.C., was a guest
of the Omicron Delta Kappa Honorary Fraternity for its fall tapping ceremony, and he aptly chose leadership as his theme.

Dr. Russell pointed out that our position in life today is essentially no different from that one hundred years ago.
Our forefathers encountered as many hardships upholding democracy then as we do today and experienced the same fear towards gunpowder
then as we feel towards the atomic bomb in 1958. Human ideas and the mind represent a great challenge today,
and we can meet this challenge and thereby extend our views only through education. It is necessary that we accumulate
all knowledge possible and have a broad-minded outlook on life. Dr. Russell referred to Winston Churchill as one who was
constantly accumulating knowledge and fitting it into a personal philosophy. Knowledge in itself is useless; its value can be measured
by its effect on the overall philosophy and principles of one’s life. A person is not judged by the number
of facts he has at his command but by his philosophy and principles which encompass these facts. We must strengthen
ourselves in order to make our opinion felt in the world.

Dr. Russell is an advocate of the continuance of nuclear tests, for if we ban them, we are disarming America.
Only if we have a strong military can we be assured of a commanding position in the world and thereby
quell the communist movement. We as individuals have a part in these affairs. Foreign affairs should be bipartisan; each individual
should feel their weight. As John Donne so notably said: “No man is an island, entire of itself; Every man
is a piece of the continent, a part of the main; If a clod be washed away by the sea,
Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory...” (Continued On Page Four)
