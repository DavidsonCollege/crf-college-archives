Thursday, March 2, 1989 THE DAVIDSONIAN

Are you a

We hate to tell people, but Freddie and his lamp won't be appearing here this week. Neither have been seen for almost two weeks. It's almost as if they vanished from the face of the Earth!

An official Seale poll. Your chance to talk behind Freddie's back!

And on added bonus! As it turns out, he's been captured by Libyan terrorists and a readers' vote will determine his future.

They've sent us a video tape to prove he is still alive!

Your vote will decide the future of Freddie. So be sure you don't forget to help out the ballet staff—and remember, ballet stuffing is against the honor code!
