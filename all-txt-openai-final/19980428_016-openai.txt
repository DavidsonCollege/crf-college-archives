THE DAVIDSONIAN

By Brian MAYERHOFER

Most Valuable Player

Linda Rothemund

While the Wildcats had an average season this year, Rothemund, a junior, was always exceptional. Rothemund, a candidate for All-American
honors, was among the nation’s leaders in several categories.

Linda is currently third in the nation in averaging assists per game with 2.07. Her teammate and fellow standout, Amanda
Fleck, is seventeenth in the same category with 1.5 APG. Rothemund also averaged 4.07 points per game. This has also
given her national recognition as she is seventeenth in this category.

Her seven assists against Limestone was not only a school record but leads the nation in assists in a single
game. Her eleven points against Limestone places her in a tie for second for most points in a single game.
Linda finished with twenty-eight goals and twenty-nine assists to finish with fifty-seven points.

In just three years, Rothemund already holds the record for assists in a career with forty-nine. Rothemund has also provided
strong leadership for the young team. By the end of the season, both Rothemund and Fleck were the clear leaders
of the squad.

Rookie of the Year

Lauren Kenchington

On a team stocked with talented freshmen, it was tough deciding who was the best. Lauren Hancock and Stephanie Hunter
both had excellent first seasons as they led the defense. At attack, Rachel Bowen came on very strong at the
end to finish with twenty-six points.

Still, Kenchington was a model of consistency over the season and started from day one. Lauren started all twelve games
she played in and finished with thirty-one points on nineteen goals and twelve assists.

In her first game against the University of Denver, she had a hat trick. She also had excellent performances against
Notre Dame, Limestone, and Duquesne. After Katie Williams went down with an injury, both Kenchington and Bowen filled the void
left by her absence. When Kenchington missed the last two games of the season, her presence was severely missed.

Most Improved Award

Katie Nelson

While senior Katie Nelson was expected to provide leadership as one of two seniors on the team, her offensive output
was surprising on a team with such prolific scorers as Rothemund, Fleck, and Williams.

Nelson started all but one game this year. She finished the season with a career-high sixteen goals. She also exceeded
her high for points in a season by ten. Nelson had twenty-two points on sixteen goals and six assists. Last
season, she had twelve points on nine goals and three assists.

She was a crucial part of the attack, especially on faceoffs. She had several games in which she scored multiple
goals, including Denver, Duquesne, and Limestone. Nelson, while providing leadership, definitely raised the level of her play this year.

Mike Hood

@ Amanda Fleck’s high offensive output this season brought her national recognition in several offensive categories.

TUESDAY, MARCH 24, 1998

@ Senior attacker Katie Nelson’s final season as a Wildcat was her best. Her season total of 22 points, which
tied her for fifth on the team in scoring, was ten points higher than her total last season.

1998 Overall Record: 5-9
