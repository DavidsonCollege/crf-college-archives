**Freshman Blake Sends Rocket Up 5,000 Feet**

By BOB LATHAN
Davidsonian Managing Editor

All U.S. hope for catching up with Russia in the missile race is not lost. Davidson College, it seems, has
at least one “scientist” whose reading of Sputnik has jarred him into action. Eighteen-year-old Bob Blake, a freshman from Abbeville,
S.C., leaned back in his chair in 207 Cannon and unhesitatingly told of his feat. He and Richard Dyar, a
senior at Abbeville High School, had made two successful launchings of home-grown rockets during the Christmas holidays. Blake was quick
not to take all the credit for himself.

“Richard Dyar and I both did it. He’s interested in physics and plans to major in that next year at
Georgia Tech.”

**TWO SENT UP**

The first rocket, 8-9 inches in length, soared to an altitude of 4,000 feet on New Year's Day. The following
day “Sputnik II” reached 5,000 feet. Both were a little longer at 10 inches and three-fourth inches in diameter. Blake,
a pre-med student, continued: “We had been working on it about three weeks before it happened. That was about a
week before the holidays began. We drew up our plans and tooled it at a machine shop.

“We fired it in a big open field so it wouldn't hurt anyone. It was powered with solid fuel composed
of potassium nitrate, sulphur, and charcoal (carbon).”

How did they calculate the height reached by the rockets? “We set it off at a certain angle and by
using physics and you know like that, we could get at the altitude.” Blake admits that hearing all about the
Russian satellites “sorta started” them off on their idea. “We were just fooling around. We were interested in things like
that. I guess the school thinks I’m somebody half-cracked, but we weren't trying for any glory. We were just fooling
around.”

Blake confesses that he doesn’t have any immediate plans for setting off additional rockets, but it is predicted by unofficial
sources that he will be breaking the stratosphere by 1960.

“We are running a race. We must understand this in our thinking about Russia.” This is the way Daniel Schorr,
Moscow correspondent for the Columbia Broadcasting System, summed up the attitude that he believes the American people must have during
the years to come. Mr. Schorr comes to Davidson tonight at 8:15 p.m. as a lecturer, presented by the “Artist
Series.” A question and answer period in the Ballroom of the College Union will be held immediately after the lecture.

**Career Reviewed**

Schorr comes to the Davidson campus well qualified. He began his career as a newspaper man in 1934 at the
age of eighteen. Since that time, he has worked for the New York Times, the London Daily Mail, and since
1953 has been a member of the CBS News Staff. June 2, 1957 saw Mr. Schorr participating in...

**‘Chances Slim’ On New**

College authorities have stated that the burned Pi Kappa Phi house shown above will not be rebuilt. The College will
receive approximately $7,000 from insurance for the burned house, which was constructed in 1928 at a cost of $5,000; however,
to rebuild the house today would cost $31,000. At the completion of the new fraternity houses, the college plans to
rent the old ones as offices and as housing for faculty and students. The fee which the college would have
to ask for the rent of a newly-built house would be too high to justify the reconstruction of the Pi
Kappa Phi house. The building and ground crew of the college will tear down the remains of the house in
the near future and will landscape the area.

...tempted to keep an ‘open mind.” These were the comments of Lloyd Chapin, President of the Davidson College Y.M.C.A. This
answer came in response to a question about the rumored proposal to break the connection between the College Y and
the National Y. The result would be the setting up of a campus “Student Christian Association.”

**CHAPIN AND STAPLES**

Both Chapin and Dr. George Staples, Minister to Students, were interviewed at the DAVIDSONIAN’S weekly press conference. Chapin said that
this perennial question of our association with the National Y was brought to focus last year by Dean Spencer. He
headed a committee to study the problem. The Y Cabinet this year is studying and will continue to study the

**VOLUNTARY**

Both the Minister and the President expressed a strong preference for the voluntary membership aspect of the Y here on
campus as it has existed for the last three years. Has this voluntary membership among the students strengthened or weakened
the Y? Chapin: “I can't make a...

Jason McManus, a 1956 graduate of Davidson, was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship in Atlanta, Georgia, on January 4. McManus led
his class last year at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and Foreign Affairs at Princeton. He was awarded the
Woodlands Foundation Fellowship and is doing research on politics in New Jersey, with Mr. W. H. Whyte, associate editor of
“Fortune” and author of “The Organization Man.” Conarroe attended Davidson on a Union Carbide Scholarship and made a very outstanding
record in English Honors. He won a Fullbright Fellowship to Cornell, where he has received his M.A. and is working
towards his Doctor of Philosophy degree. Professor Lilly considered Mr. Conarroe one of his ablest students and was personally pleased
he had consented to teach at Davidson. Dr. Lilly commented on Conarroe, “The English Department feels that it is quite
fortunate in having Mr. Conarroe a member of its department during the spring semester of 1958. “It is felt that
he has a scholarly approach to his subject matter and that he has the interest and energy to be a
fine teacher.” Wolfe Captures Writing Award Willard Wolfe won the annual Woodrow Wilson Award for Creative Writing in a chapel
presentation today. The prize, a set of books, was presented by D. Grier Martin, college treasurer. Wolfe’s paper was entitled
“New Myths for Old, A Study in Comparative Literature.” The award was established by Dr. Daub Kerr, an alumnus of
the Class of 1915.
