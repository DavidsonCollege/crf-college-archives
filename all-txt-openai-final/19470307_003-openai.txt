**Wildcat Sports**
By SAM ERVIN

The 1946-47 basketball season is officially over on the Davidson campus. The much-hoped-for Tournament bid was not forthcoming. The majority
of the circuit's coaches expressed their desire to invite the eight top teams on the basis of percentage alone. By
their action, they have implied that no serious schedule deficiencies exist; that all of the sixteen contenders have faced opponents
of equal calibre.

Prior to the Raleigh meeting, no references were made by your scribe to the rather obvious fact that several North
Carolina and Virginia Southern Conference teams failed to play representative schedules. Judging from past performances, it was anticipated that those
irregularities would be ironed out. This, however, did not prove to be the case. Therefore, this complaint is being voiced
not because any specific team was not invited to participate, but because this display of laxness on the part of
some of the individuals responsible for the welfare of the loop is a threat to its future. Unless competitors abandon
selfish ideas and petty jealousies, and base their selections upon bare facts, the general public is going to lose faith
in the annual event.

The tournament was originally founded to provide a method for determining the Conference Champion. In the past, it has served
its purpose reasonably well. Now, however, a great number of people feel that the powers that be have failed to
extend invites to the top eight quintets. In the places of some of them are other teams whose schedules should
not have been considered adequate.

The University of South Carolina has been already the chief target of the criticism, and rightly so. The Gamecocks met
only one of the leading eight (North Carolina) and were defeated on both occasions. On the other hand, both Wake
Forest and Davidson faced all of the three top-seeded clubs and the former had the distinction of upsetting State’s Hoosier
Hotshots. Also, Davidson defeated the South Carolinians by scores of 74-43, and 52-50, while the Deacons split with the boys
from Columbia. Yet, for some unknown reason, South Carolina received a Tournament bid and its conquerors did not. Unless the
league officials want to lose the confidence of the sporting public, some corrective action must be taken. If some of
the coaches persist in refusing to use the double “veto” against teams that do not play a satisfactory number of
the pace-setters, the present scheme should be abandoned. Perhaps by forcing each team to tangle with each other school at
least once during the regular season, the desired results might be obtained.

Appears in print, the State's gowning Furman, Whit Cobb proved, Washington University, and paced by a pair of backs, edged
all with a season and 3 losses, having taken two primes the week before. The Red Terrors will be well
on their way to their first Southern Conference Basketball championship in many a moon. Davidsonians present the University of South
Carolina practices scrimmage. After rolling over the Richmond Spiders by a score of 69-46, Coach Ernie Case’s men earned the
right to face North Carolina in the finals by spanking a gallant Duke five, led by the peerless Ed Koffenberger.
The White Phantoms, paced by Jim Hamilton and Jim White, shaded South Carolina in the opener, 60-53, and then side-stepped
George Washington's Colonials by a nine-point margin.

The University of Kentucky's basketeers, after running roughshod over all opposition in the annual Southeastern Conference Tournament, added insult to
injury by completely monopolizing the loop’s All-Star quintet. Another Wildcat was placed on the second team—Roney Cates, ace center, racked
up 15 points per game in three appearances as the Guilford County five captured the North Carolina League Crown. Cates'
season total is the second highest ever amassed on the North Carolina collegiate front. Only the White Phantom’s great George
Glamack was able to do better. Three of the five leading point-getters for the Tar Heel State’s Southern Conference representatives
were not on hand when the curtain went up on the yearly playoffs for the title. Davidson's Ed White and
Buddy Cheek, third and fourth in the scoring column respectively, as well as Jim Gentry of Wake Forest, were absent.
Appointment of Coach Shepherd to the United States’ Olympic Basketball Committee is but another example of the high regard in
which the Cat cage mentor is held throughout the nation.

Mike Williams Stars
The Cats finished their campaign Saturday by downing a scrappy Furman five, 67-55. The Paladins made a spirited bid in
the second half and drew within five points, but Cobb and his backcourt mates held their composure. Captains George Seere
and Cobb, with some flashy cage work, led the Cats to victory. The Middies from the Naval Academy, pre-meet favorites,
were able to cope only 12 1-2 points, finishing fifth. Running into stiff competition, the Wildcats were unable to place
one man in the string of events, but the trip gave much-needed experience to all of the participants.

Port Runs Well
Dick Port, hurdler in his pre-war days, ran well in the semifinals of the 70-yard hurdle event. He was less
than three feet behind the Red Dragon flyer who won the event. Bill also took part in the 440-yard dash.
Co-captain of last year’s team, Bob, Mike Williams, and Gene Rob McGehee, all participated in the events. The Wildcats finished
their campaign Saturday by downing a scrappy Furman five, 67-55. The Paladins made a spirited bid in the second half
and drew within five points, but Cobb and his backcourt mates held their composure.

Roddy marks up two more points as the Davidson Wildcats defeated C.C.U.N.C. 53-46, in their last game of the year.
Also shown, poised to catch the rebound, are Bill Iverson and Bob Elvers of the Red and Black, and Captain
Burkley (17), Mosely (10), and Brice (13) of the Owls. The win was Davidson's second over the C.C.U.N.C. quintet, the
Jay-Vees having downed them, 44-41, in an earlier meeting in the Charlotte Armory.
