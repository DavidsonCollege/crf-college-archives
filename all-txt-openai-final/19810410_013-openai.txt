Stars & Bars

“Machu Picchu” by Jim Crowe

Upon hearing that Walter C. Camp Football Foundation’s annual ‘Distinguished American’ medallion was awarded to General Alexander Haig

Freud and music: A tripartite discussion

I. Drums
I am the pulse, the mating thrust
There is life in my heads, my shells,
My shining cymbals
I am the anvil of my art

II. Guitar
I am the clown prince
The flamboyant front man
The fame, the groupies—they are mine!

III. Organ
Nooooooo, baby—
To deny violence is to deny life

“Nigger.” Our stomachs still turn.
Musty sandals and uncalloused feet fall into step.
Not knowing how to dress, we march
Brandishing our “HAIG IS A WAR CRIMINAL” signs,
Our pale skins reddening.
But Consumer Rights, Alan Bakke and Afro Sheen
Commercials divert the camera's eyes.

When Bach fed me, it was
“to the glory of God alone”
I have found God useful
for my purposes

In our world the poor earn seven thousand dollars
And can afford potato chips and Cadillacs,
Everyone’s best friends are black,
And Marxist equality’s a Christian fad.
Mortgage rates and inflation afflict both black and white,
Only clouding the issue.

And we
Catch ourselves humming “You Light Up My Life.”
So we soak our feet, tired of Bob McNamara’s wasted tears and
Eldridge Cleaver’s black power.
Tired of a movement shortfused by too many leaders left unkilled.
Paralyzed, we now understand charity only hides
repression,
“Consciousness-raising” manipulates,
And the Peace Corps exports our great white hopes.
So we sip our imported beer
And turn to the sun and the atom to seek the first cause.
Rehearsing our song of solidarity.
