**Wildcat Quint Wins Ten Out of Eighteen Games**

**Red and Black Five Wins Eight Out of First Eleven Contests But Slumps Toward End**

**STALEY LEADS SCORING**

**After Losing Five Straight Games Wildcats Take Two Final Engagements of Year**

Davidson closed her 1924 basketball schedule of 18 games in the local gymnasium last Thursday with a 44 to 13
victory over the Statesville Athletic Club, making a total of ten victories and eight losses for the season. Like all
Davidson teams, this year's quintet was invincible at home, losing two of the nine games played on the local court.
The only college team to secure a decision at the Davidson gym was the Wake Forest five. Charlotte “Y,” with
its 37 to 23 victory, rendered to Davidson her other home defeat.

In the first 11 games of the season, Coach Younger's cohorts emerged victorious in eight, losing to Charlotte “Y,” Carolina,
and Trinity in Charlotte. The next five games were defeats at the hands of Wake Forest, twice, Charlotte “Y,” State,
and Guilford. The last two games of the season, against Belmont at Belmont, and Statesville A.C. were victories.

Davidson's total score for the season was 552 points as against the 480 counters of her opponents. Of the 552
points, 356 were chalked up in the first 11 games against 179 by her opponents, for an average of 32
points to the game. After her victory over the fast and furious South Carolina quint, the Wildcats suffered a slump
in which her opponents outscored her 221 to 196. Five of Davidson's eight defeats came in these games, during the
slump.

In games played with college teams, Davidson won five and lost six, failing by 12 points to equal their opponents,
who scored 328 points to the Wildcats’ total of 316. Charlotte “Y” was the only non-college team to take the
Cats in and Davidson outscored non-college teams, composed of old college stars, 236 to 152. Of these games, Davidson won
five and lost two.

Of the first string men, only four played in every game. Staley, the reliable right forward, counted for 176 points
and led the team in scoring. Laird, the sorrel-topped lad from Decatur, was next in scoring honors with a total
of 147 points. Of 29 attempts at goals after foul, he sunk 21 shots. Captain Davis played a heady game
and led (Continued on page 2)

**Tom Baker Will Be Toastmaster At Soph Banquet**

At a recent meeting of the class, it was decided to have the annual Soph banquet in Charlotte at the
Chamber of Commerce. This banquet is to be held at 7:00 p.m. on Thursday, March 13th. Tom Baker was elected
toastmaster. A committee consisting of E. M. Regen, chairman; Frank Hudson, Shaw, Minter, and Bouvier, has been hard at work
on the plans for this banquet for some time. Tickets are to be sold to the members of the Sophomore
class at a nominal price. These tickets cover the expenses of the plate, decorations, programs, and favors, but each individual
has to pay for and arrange his own transportation.

Besides the Soph class, several members of the faculty and prominent men in the other classes will be present and
give speeches. After the banquet, the class will probably attend the Imperial in a body. The manager has promised to
rope off a section for them. The Soph class has been doing everything in its power to make its banquet
the best one that has ever been held by Davidson. An abundance of good things to eat and a fine
time is promised to all who attend.

**Jones Represents Local Chapter at Convention**

**National Convention of Omicron Delta Kappa Meets at Kentucky Institution**

The National Convention of the Omicron Delta Kappa, Honorary Leaders Fraternity, met at Centre College, Danville, Ky., at 8:00 p.m.,
February 22nd. R. R. Jones represented the local chapter. There were present at the convention delegates from all nine circles
of the society, as well as President W. M. Brown, Vice-president A. G. Williams, Publicity Secretary H. D. Cotton, and
Treasurer J. H. Hewlett.

On the evening of Friday, February 22nd, the reports of the officers were given, and several committees were appointed to
facilitate the work of the convention. On Saturday morning, the convention was formally opened with an address by President Montgomery,
of Centre College. The reports from the different circles were rendered by the representatives, and suggestions in these (Continued on

**New Plan Passed By Trustees Will Allow Fraternities to Build Chapter Houses**

The fraternity situation at Davidson is perhaps brighter now than it has ever been, due to the recent action of
the Board of Trustees of Davidson College. The Board met Wednesday, February 27th, and passed action to allow the fraternities
to build chapter houses either on or off college property, the details to be left to the Faculty Committee on
Fraternities, and finally approved by the Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees.

Within the past year or two, the acuteness of the situation of fraternities has been brought into the limelight more
than ever before, augmented by the establishment of several new fraternities. An agitation has been going on for some time
for better accommodation for the fraternities, and this agitation has culminated in the recent action of the Board of Trustees.

Many details will be connected with the building of the houses. The Faculty Committee on Fraternities will approve the plans
and costs of the houses, approve the location, limit the number of students that will room in the houses, determine
whether the students will be permitted to have their meals in them, and many other details necessary for approval. One
of the features of the action of the Board was to allow the houses to be built either on or
off college property. If they should be built on the campus, they would be placed at points which could not
be utilized for any college purposes. Locations which have already been suggested as feasible places are those which could not
be used by the college. Whatever plans and details are approved by the Faculty Committee will also be referred to
the Executive Committee of the Board for final sanction.

How many students will be allowed to room in the houses has not been stated and will be later decided
by the authorities, but the number will hardly exceed six. The Faculty Committee will also determine whether fraternity members will
be allowed to have their meals in the houses, and will formulate other restrictions.

This action by the Board will afford an opportunity for the development of fraternities heretofore lacking. When new nationals are
petitioned by locals, the locals will be (Continued on page 6)

**Trinity Contests Chosen From Fifteen Speakers**

**Cox, Walthall, Story, Little, Wharton, Elkins and Patterson Selected**

**RUHR QUESTION DEBATED**

**Trinity to be Met at Durham—Emory Debate to be Held at Queens**

The preliminary contest for the choosing of intercollegiate debaters was held in Shearer Hall on the night of Friday, 29th,
in which W. M. Cox, D. B. Walthall, P. B. Story, L. C. Little, D. B. Wharton, L. D. Elkins,
and P. M. Patterson were chosen to represent the college in the approaching debates against Emory and Trinity College. It
was for the purpose of choosing seven speakers, three for each of the two teams and one alternate, from a
list of 12 contestants that this preliminary contest was held. The subject for discussion was, Resolved, the Ruhr. While it
was left to the discretion of the speakers which side to uphold, the fact that Davidson had been given the
affirmative side in the main debates caused the greater number to choose the affirmative side. Those upholding this were D.
B. Walthall, A. C. Ray, K. T. Pullen, W. M. Cox, J. L. Holthouser, R. B. Parker, P. M. Patterson,
W. Z. Bradford, and H. B. Price; the negative by P. J. Story, D. B. Wharton, and L. C. Little.
The arguments of the evening hinged upon Articles 12, 17, and 18 of the Treaty of Versailles and the decision
handed down by the Reparations Committee in which it sanctioned the action of Service in Regular Army.

Following the schedule of rotation for officers who have been detailed on R.O.T.C. duty for four years, Capt. T. G.
Hearn, who has been Professor of Military Science and Tactics during his term here, and Capt. M. H. Ellis, will
leave, when the school term expires, for duty with troops in the regular army and cavalry school respectively. Warrant Officer
J. B.Ryan also leaves at the same time for Camp Benning, and service in the Twenty-ninth Infantry. Captain Geo. H.
Weems, already popular because of his interest in college affairs and his ability, will succeed Captain Hearn as P. M.
S. and T. for 1924-'25. Lt. J. H. George, who completes his term here at the close of the 1924-'25
session, will remain as assistant P. M. S. and T. Captain Hearn’s work has given Davidson a high rating among
the schools of the Corps Area, and he secured an honor rating. Through his work and that of Captain Weems,
commutation will be allowed for uniforms. The good material used in their making will add greatly to the appearance of
the unit. Juniors will be allowed $3.00 and Seniors $7.00. The efficiency attained here is due to a continuation of
Captain Hearn’s hard work. Another commissioned officer will join him and Lieutenant George, and two non-commissioned officers, in addition to
Sergeant Pritchert, will complete the personnel of the unit.

Barrage of Snow Greets Freshman
Davidson Mat Men Win Two Out of Five Meets
Leaving Chapel
Selser and Cromartie Remain Undefeated Through Entire Season
The snow that fell Wednesday morning brought delight to the hearts of all upper-classmen and terror and consternation to the
wearers of the green “F's” who realized that the day of reckoning had drawn nigh. With the first advent of
the luckless freshmen on the campus, and until the last vestige of the feathery plumes of Mother Nature had faded
from the terra firma, the new boys were the recipients, willing and otherwise, of snowballs and ice from every quarter.
Beginning at Chapel, and continuing throughout the day, the Sophs with their cohorts paid back with lavishness all the indignities
suffered since the mighty Fresh no longer have to bow and scrape to them on account of the no hazing
proposition. The Royal Knights of the Aqua Club were out in full force with membership cards in their hands in
the shape of brick-lined snowballs. This distinguished order succeeded in initiating most of the Freshmen, and those that they missed
were taken care of by the herd of yelling fanatics that attacked the diminishing lines with a zeal that would
have done justice to a regiment of Moros or Eskimos.

I. R. C. Convention Meets At Furman and G. W. C.
Answering the invitation of Furman University and Greenville Woman's College, delegates from 23 Southern colleges and universities met in Greenville
on February 29th, for the first student conference on international relations ever held in the South. Representatives from five Southern
States entered into conference on the vital interest of the day, and many notable speakers were enjoyed. In the first
act of the conference, Prof. C. B. Gosnell, of Furman University, expressed the purpose of the conference by sounding the
call to Southern students to study and think internationally, pointing out the peculiar fitness of the conference at such a
time just a few weeks after the passing of Woodrow Wilson, who had done so much to bring about goodwill
among the nations.

The first step in the actual rebuilding of Chambers Memorial Building was taken on Tuesday, February 26th, when the contract
for the building of the southern unit was awarded to Blythe & Isenhour, contractors, of Charlotte. There were 10 or
12 firms making offers for the work when the bids were opened in the office of the architect, H. C.
Hibbs, of Nashville, but Blythe & Isenhour made the best bid with $140,700. This firm is the same that built
East, West, and Watts dormitories and the Library, and their work has always been highly satisfactory to the college in
every way. Actual work of clearing away the debris of the old building has been started, and as soon as
that is finished the construction work will start. The contract calls for the completion of the building in 160 workdays
after the letting of the contract, so it is hoped to have the building ready for use by the opening
of next session, or not later than October 1st at the latest. However, there is no disposition on the part
of either the college or the architect to unduly hasten the work; they prefer to see the work done well.

Work Starts On South Wing Chambers; Building Will Be Completed by October
The building will be three stories in height, and will be the complete southern unit, and not just the southern
end or cross of the T as was at first contemplated. On the ground floor, there will be nine executive
offices, a faculty room, a storeroom, two classrooms, and instructors’ offices. On the second and third floors, there will be
19 classrooms and seven instructors’ offices. Most of the exterior of the building will be of granite and limestone, and
the roof will be of copper, the most durable roofing obtainable. The building will be fireproof, the halls will be
roomy with composition floors, and the walls will be soundproof.

The plans would have been ready for the bidders a month earlier, but at the last examination, the architect found
that he could give a much more beautiful building at a very small additional cost with a few changes. These
changes were made and, according to Mr. Hibbs, the building, which when it is completed in all ways will have
a frontage of 312 feet, will be one of the best and most beautiful college buildings anywhere.
