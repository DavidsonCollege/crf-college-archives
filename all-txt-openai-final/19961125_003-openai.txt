**Humanities program will be reviewed in spring**

Professors Boye, Kaylor, Kazee, Krentz, and Ortmayer sparked much debate with their proposal to replace the Humanities Program with seminars
for first-year students.

However, the Educational Policy Council (EPC) will not consider anything seriously until at least late spring. With two external reviewers
coming in March, the Humanities Program will be under intense review this year.

“We are going to need time to digest the information from the reviewers. If any changes are going to be
contemplated they will not happen until we have a full review of the program as part of the strategic planning
process,” says Robert Williams, Dean of Faculty.

Beyond humanities, Davidson’s writing program in general is being evaluated. Class of ‘99 member of EPC Chris Martin says, “The
proposal was meant to encourage debate and discussion about the composition requirement, rather than effect an immediate implementation of its
suggestion about the Humanities Program.”

This may not be the last of the proposals. “People should not have a sense that it is either this
proposal or not. The whole college community will be talking about this,” says committee member Professor Lynn Poland.

No action regarding the Humanities Program is going to be taken for quite a while.

“The proposal is a simple-minded solution to a complex problem,” says Williams. “It’s the answer to a question that hasn’t
been asked yet.”

**Some students barter butts for bagels**

The Davidson Health Center held its first Great American Smoke Out last Thursday in an effort to spread awareness of
the dangers of smoking and to encourage smokers to quit.

The two major events that took place were the Butts for Bagels exchange and the lung capacity test.

The Butts for Bagels exchange was simple. As Georgia Ringle, coordinator of the event and Health Service Educator, explains, “Students
and faculty are given the opportunity to trade cigarettes or chewing tobacco for bagels... I have had many people give
me whole packs.”

This trade is a way to get smokers to make some small commitment to stop smoking. Many students also received
survival kits to help them quit for good.

Ringle says the event was “more successful than expected... We gave away over 100 survival kits to smokers who want
to quit and [to] friends of smokers... I’m very hopeful about getting casual smokers to quit.”

The lung capacity test was administered by Bob Noble, Manager for Respiratory Care Service at Iredell Memorial Hospital, and Valerie
Velte, Director of Community Health and Wellness at Iredell Memorial Hospital. The test detects the effects of smoking by measuring
a person’s lung capacity against the expected capacity.

Both Noble and Velte agree that the event was a success.

Velte says there was “a great response, both students and faculty participated... And a few people have decided to quit...”

Velte also says, “The major purpose of the event is to remind people of the effects of smoking, and provide
support for those who decide to quit.”

Although the Smoke Out was successful, there were difficulties in getting people to participate. Ringle found that she had to
“really bother people to get them to stop by our table... Many people just can’t give up smoking.”

Noble adds that “Many people just don’t think all the health problems related to smoking will happen to them, and
nicotine can also prevent quitting due to its addictive nature.” Velte says many people are “afraid to participate in the
lung capacity test because they are afraid they will fail.”
