A

Five for Myrtle

Fortuitous query:

Why did the king

In his last dying deed

Give fourteen ripe red rubies
‘To the only idiot child

Of the village smith?’

Amorous assertion:

Bill J. had never
Not once

In his life seen
Such a navel.

Cynical overtones:

A red-faced monkey
On my mother’s head
Wonders why

But no one can say.

Amends run amok:

Margaret would have
Kissed him to make up
But she couldn’t finish
Tying her shoe-laces
In time.

Motivated response:
The clock doesn’t stop

But it’s all the same now
Anyway.

Caisson Disease

While I was away

the car was dinged so

that the driver’s door was
jammed shut you know climbing
across the entire seat to get out.

Uncle and mother watched New
Years on television,

and when they heard me

they paraded down to the
backdoor to tell me

It was the dumbest thing ever
He never saw us sitting there

I was so tired I tried to retreat
into the dark pantry, but

Uncle armed me into the garage
to tell me

See here, fingering his voice all

over the damaged side, it will need

a new front piece and here a new

thing for the fender

Sally Stow

My interest in the damage bored
Uncle so we made it into
the house to watch t.v.

He drank a beer, I dozed and listened
to him tell me

I really can’t get over it
He never looked around, never

Listening one eye out the window
watching the chiaroscuro night press
minutes into hours

waiting for the maybe snow to arrive
hoping for the neighborhood to yell
We'll fix the damn car

New Years came by and Uncle
paused long enough to sit up, clap
and tell me

Happy New Year

Augustus E. Succop, III
