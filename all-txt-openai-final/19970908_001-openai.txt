French professor Lauren Yoder and his wife, Suzy, would wake up in the middle of the night, startled and shaken, to the sound of grenades detonating nearby.

It’s been four months since the Yoders returned from their two-year peace odyssey in Burundi in central Africa, but they still jump when they hear a car backfire. As volunteers with the Mennonite Central Committee, the Yoders lived in Bujumbura, the country’s capital. Their apartment overlooked Lake Tanganyika and was a mile from the University of Burundi, the country’s only college. From there, the Yoders observed the educational ob-

**Williams stepping down as dean of faculty**

One week after losing its Director of Career Services, Davidson will experience another change in one of its top administrative posts. Dean of Faculty Robert Williams announced that he will retire from that position and return to teaching. Williams says he departs with mixed emotions: “My feelings at the prospect of leaving the administration lie somewhere between Richard Nixon’s ‘You won’t have me to kick around anymore’ and Martin Luther King’s ‘Free at last, free at last, Great God Almighty, I’m free at last.’ Enough is enough.” He said the best part of his decision is that he will only be saying goodbye to a job, and not to his friends in the college community. Following a sabbatical year in 1998-99, Williams will return to Davidson. He will teach courses in Russian history, the humanities, and modern European intellectual history.

During his term, Williams has professionalized the faculty by arranging funding for and eventually appointing a dozen named professorships, establishing a faculty tenure committee, revising the faculty hearings process, instituting a review process for tenured professors and for promotion to full professor, adding a substantial number of women to the faculty, reducing the teaching load from six to five courses annually, and offering fifth-year leaves of absence for assistant professors. He also takes pride in having nominated six faculty members who have been honored as “Professors of the Year” by the Council of the Advancement and Support of Education. Williams also directed many curricular revisions. He directed the change of the academic year

**Campus drug policy changes**

One of the most talked about changes on campus this year regards the new drug policy. The College has changed its methods of making students aware of its guidelines. Also, it has strengthened the penalties for using or selling illegal drugs. Resident Advisors are being told to emphasize Davidson’s drug policy during hall meetings. The Redbook, which lists allThe rules and regulations students must live under have added some 20 more pages addressing drugs. And, finally, the overall penalties for drug use have gotten more punitive. The pages added to the guidelines do not add extra College regulations. They are simply a reprinting of North Carolina state drug laws, which every student must obey. The pages “were added because many students did not know they would be subject to criminal penalties and could be prosecuted (by the state) despite the College’s attentions,” RLO director Kurt Holmes said.

Many students are wondering what caused the shift in policy. Primarily, the Campus Committee on Religious Life was responsible for the stronger penalties. The committee, which is composed of students and administrators, reviews the policy each year. They then send their recommendations and changes to the college president for final approval. Last year, the committee felt that the previous policy’s lack of mandatory suspension after the second offense was too lenient. “The council did vote in a stricter policy,” council member and SGA vice president Ann Harriot Fisher said. “Any student caught with drugs for a second time will now be suspended for at least one semester.” First-time offenders have to go through drug education or treatment programs and are put on probation.

In some past cases, “there was willful ignorance about the health consequences and legal repercussions regarding illegal drugs,” Dean of Students Tom Shandley said. Being a member of the college community does not shield a person from state laws, fines, and penalties regarding illegal drug use.

Regarding what might appear as a stricter RLO anti-drug policy, dealing with the banning of candles and incense from all rooms, the rule change does not have to do with drugs. Instead, it stems from a past incident where a candle fell over and burned a coffee table in a senior apartment. RLO has instituted the ban to avoid such fire hazards.

Finally, the College has seen an increase in drug policy violations in the last couple of years. Both Shandley and Holmes hope that the added emphasis about the negative legal and physical consequences of drug use will stem the rise.

To return to the classroom from trimesters to semesters. Minors, double majors, minus grades, the writing center, new study abroad programs, and the College’s first courses in Chinese and Japanese language instruction also began during his term. He says his successor will face the challenge of finding adequate space for the College’s teaching needs, and maintaining the quality of existing facilities. Other issues include sorting out the implications of information technology on campus, increasing faculty compensation, maintaining a proper constitutional role of the faculty in an increasingly complex and professional working environment, and coping with the overwhelming costs of teaching science at a liberal arts college.
