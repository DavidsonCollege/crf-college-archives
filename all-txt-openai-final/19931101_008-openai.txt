### Three Unions? What a ridiculous proposal.

Last week, the consultants from MPC returned to Davidson to announce their findings and suggest solutions to the problems caused by an anemic social system that breaks the campus into distinct social circles. What they propose is astounding—three new centers designed to bring people together and provide facilities adequate for the social lives of 1,500 people.

Location seemed to be the defining factor. One center at a “student crossroads” would meet social needs; one at a “community crossroads” would offer an outlet for town, faculty, and student people to mingle; and one “satellite” facility designed for larger activities.

Such a proposal illuminates three very important conclusions. First, the MPC consultants apparently do not seem to understand what is going on here. Granted, their proposal did not intend to take finances into consideration, but the thought of building three new centers seems, at the least, to have been created by people unaware of fiscal limitations which restrict the abilities of every college and university in America. We do not need abstract theories; we need practical solutions.

Second and more important, though, is that Davidson students need help. The fact that MPC recommended not one, but three facilities might indicate that we are in three times the trouble than we thought. But instead of building three facilities, why don’t we build one with three times the facilities. Three in one—(it’s a theory that has worked before).

Finally, we have “experts” telling administrators what the student body has been crying out for so long—we need social opportunities, not rules. When students spend too much time on the court, as opposed to studying—they restrict the number of weekday parties. When students miss classes or arrive tired and hungover—they make the parties close earlier in the evening. When alcohol is abused—they restrict the number and size of containers brought up the stairs. These policies have not only proved controversial, but ineffective. It seems the whole time, students have only been screaming—”GIVE US SOMETHING ELSE TO DO.”

We need a new union that brings the community together and provides social activities that do the same. It is as simple as that. If nothing else, the MPC consultants made that point clear. Let’s hope those who can make this happen finally listen.

But where? Here is a chance for the Administration to figure out where to build the new Union. Remodel Johnston. Leave the basketball court for intramural use and build a second level that surrounds the court but allows visitors to look down on the court. Paint the place. Build an outside deck. Make use of all those little offices. Don’t continue to waste all of that space.

### And finally...

Johnetta Cole’s speech at Convocation was well thought out and important to Davidson’s process of diversifying. Although not all members of the editorial staff agreed with every idea she embraced, all were impressed with her abilities, intelligence, and passion. Still, we were left wondering how someone who teaches at an almost exclusively female, black institution could preach so much diversity. We were also wondering whose idea it was to invite her, and, more to the point, if that person was looking to push an agenda. All we know is that SGA President Alden Smith sure had a big smile on his face throughout Dr. Cole’s presentation.

### LETTERS

#### Defending the directory's cover

To the editors,

Despite my longtime respect for the opinions and conscience of my colleague Professor Kaylor, I believe that this one time I do not wish for him to speak for me. If he hasn’t missed the point of the witty Pop Art cover of the 1993-1994 Davidson Telephone Directory (“Directories are a ‘travesty’,” The Davidsonian, October 25, 1993, p. 7), he has at least missed the joke.

Errol C. Gibson’s crayon-colored design and waggish caption have nothing to do with suggesting that “at Davidson we want ‘girls’ to entertain our ‘boys’” (a bizarre notion both beyond my own powers of suggestion or of imagination). The “Sam” to which the “you’ve-come-a-long-way-baby” comic-book heroine murmurs so familiarly on her phone is surely Sam Spencer—Dr. Samuel Reid Spencer, Jr., President Emeritus of Davidson College, whose unfailing support and leadership helped bring coeducation to Davidson in 1973.

I, too, find it difficult to believe that it’s only been twenty years that there have been women students at Davidson, so much a part of life at Davidson.College are they now. It is, in fact, because women are so integral to the learning and teaching and leading here in 1993 that

To the editors,

Everything that you are about to read rests on the assumption that Dr. Kaylor was actually serious when he said, "... the directories should be recalled, apologies made to women and men..." etc. etc. blah blah blah. If he was not serious, please ignore everything below this line.

In my three plus years at Davidson, I have learned a few things, but one bit of knowledge surpasses the rest; never argue with a Davidson professor, especially one of philosophy, religion, or something really theoretical. At this point in our lives, PhDs are just smarter and better arguers than we are. Call it the postulate of higher learning. With this in mind, I’ve chosen to avoid my usual confrontational approach, and show Dr. Kaylor the way I feel in what I find a sneaky, faceless, weaker way; I am writing to him in the "South’s Foremost College Weekly." So here it goes.

Dr. Kaylor wants all 5,000, or however many, directories to be printed again, at the cost of the

Prozac quells suicidal thoughts

To the editors,

This is yet another response to Stephen Faller’s article about depression and Prozac. I agree with him on some points and disagree on others, but to me, the most important issue is: why take antidepressants? This is where he and I part company. This is my personal story.

Throughout high school, but particularly during my junior year, I was alienated from my parents and friends. As the year went on, I got continually more depressed to the point of being suicidal. Unfortunately, nobody knew, so nobody could help me. I concealed it very well to everyone around me because I was ashamed. I was ashamed of not being perfect, and I was terrified of opening up to other people no matter what the issue. Now I look back and see it as a miracle that I survived. My grades were better than ever, and I was raking in the “achievements,” but at the

To the editors,

This letter is in response to Chris Frampton’s article “Why so much country music?” Let me try to explain, that is, if Chris is intelligent enough to comprehend this answer.

Although I enjoy a variety of musical styles, country music has been a central part of my life, and it has only grown dearer over the years. Country music is spreading like wildfire for a variety of reasons, but mainly because people not only enjoy it, but they also relate to it. No matter how much you want to deny it, country music, as well as gospel and R&B, are the roots of America’s people. I bet that I could even find a country song that Chris Frampton resembles. And, if Chris hasn’t noticed, country music is not all beer-drinking cowboys leaving their cheatin’ wives in the pickup while simultaneously yodeling a tune. This musical style, traditionally associated with the South and Midwest, has evolved into quite a large range of rhythms and themes.

Now, for the most important aspect of this letter. Although a lot of us are intelligent, country music fans and artists would rather be seen as real people. We love Papaw, Mamaw, and sitting in the porch swing. Most people, especially those here at Davidson, probably never have and never will appreciate the finer things in life such as wading in the creek in cut-offs, the art of eating muscadines, or giving a loud rebel yell. Whether you want to wallow in self-pity or kick up your heels, country music is where to be.

Chris, this letter just isn’t long enough to give you the help you need, but here are a few hints. Give them a try.

1. Garth Brooks
2. Dale Earnhardt
3. Write about something you actually know about.

Yee-haw!!

Sincerely,
Carey A. McAlister ’97
