Court Calls Up Wayward Frosh

“Many Freshmen do not have the proper attitude of respect toward upperclassmen,” said Court of Control Judge Phil Lewis when questioned about the Court session in chapel today. Lewis commended the Freshman Class for having spirit but expressed concern that they have not learned to control it in the proper way toward becoming an integral part of the student body. He explained that the majority of complaints he has received concern the cocky attitude of the Freshmen.

“Among those called before the Court this morning were Jim Fleagle, Hugh Barger, Watts Auman, Tommy Simpson, Lewis Steele, Jack Rose, Charlie Patterson, Peter Powell, Sid Sowers, Marley Carroll, and Bob James. Although the hat check in chapel Tuesday showed that most Freshmen were wearing their hats, Lewis stated that hat checks will continue to be held in the future.

Lewis Spots Chosen For Houses

Positions of the individual fraternities on the new court were selected at a drawing on Tuesday night, October 1, Bob Jones, president of the Interfraternity Council, presided at the historic occasion which was attended by approximately two hundred students and faculty members. Dr. W. G. McGavock, chairman of the faculty committee on fraternities, made several general statements about the construction which is now progressing in an area embracing 15 acres behind the present dormitory row. He explained something of the variations of the exterior of these houses.

PATTERSON MEMORIAL

The court would be named after the Reverend W. S. Patterson, a retired Presbyterian minister. He made a substantial gift to initiate the planning and construction of the court in memory of his wife and in his honor. Mr. Martin related further that each fraternity would be given a voice in determining the interior decoration of its own house. The drawing was conducted by representatives from each of the fraternities. The positions of the houses were designated in sealed envelopes.

YMCA Drive Began Yesterday

The YMCA membership drive swung into action yesterday. Bob MacRae, social chairman of the “Y”, states that the drive is to run through Monday, October 7. Thirty-six trained solicitors are working in groups under group leaders. These leaders have assigned their men to specific dormitories and floors. The canvassers are also distributing a printed sheet containing information about the “Y”. Chapin emphasizes that many upperclassmen did not understand the methods of the drive. “We've tightened up the whole process—careful training of solicitors—more thorough organization of the drive—and it should pay off,” he commented.

Episcopal Rector To Speak Sunday

The Vesper speaker this Sunday is Reverend David W. Yates, the rector of the Chapel of the Cross in Chapel Hill, N. C. and minister to the Episcopal students at Chapel Hill. Mr. D. Grier Martin, college treasurer, announced that the number deadline was extended until November 1. Reverend Yates did his undergraduate work at the University of the South. He was also interested and active in basketball. At present, he is on the board of trustees of his university. While he was at the school, he was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa honorary fraternity. Upon graduation from the University of the South, Reverend Yates entered the Virginia Theological Seminary. He came to North Carolina at the completion of his seminary years.

DESPITE THE RAIN

Pledge Social Fraternities

This is a typical scene during last Saturday's fraternity pledging which took place between 2:00 o’clock and 3:30 p.m. A freshman indicated his choice of bids by walking down to the fraternity house.

Foreign Students Broaden Atmosphere

By JIM WILLIAMS

As classes resumed in the fall, students found in their midst two returning foreign students—Carl Sparrman of Sweden and Koogie Kwon of Korea. Carl Sparrman, a special student, is from Burträsk, Sweden, and expects to return there next year to continue his education and to teach English on the college level. Carl received the Rich Boy's Choir Scholarship and also aid from the Mary Lynn Richardson Scholarship fund. As were most students, Carl was chosen by recommendation from the Institute of International Relations. Recommendation is based upon use of the English language, their leadership record, and their interest in studies.

KWON—KOREA

Koogie Kwon, a junior who transferred from Warren-Wilson in Asheville, is a pre-med from Taegu, Korea. Koogie is also a...Richardson Scholar and will graduate from Davidson next year. He is on the soccer team and in the Male Chorus. The five students who will return this year to continue their studies are Sung Kyu Kim, Nam Young Park, Edgardo Pantigoso, Alfred Wang, and Hugo Misle Leal.

Students Add Freshmen Review Unethical Rushing Practices

Illegal and unethical practices by fraternity men concerning Confirmation and Rush Week are feared by the Interfraternity Council. Charlie Stowe, a senior member of the council, presented to the freshman class in a closed meeting last Friday a request asking for “what you saw and heard.” Stowe said these practices must stop if we are to carry on an intelligent rush program. He pointed out that this year it has affected the freshmen directly, although next year it will affect them indirectly as brothers in a fraternity.

Most of the practices do not fall under any specific rules concerning rush week. However, the council hopes to find out where the mistakes have occurred this year to improve subsequent rush weeks. The present system has been open for much criticism. Stowe and the members of his committee hope to arrive at some useful suggestions about possible changes in the system from some twenty oral reports given by various freshmen. There were no written reports turned into the IFC. Also to be used are the critiques written by the rush chairman and Vice President of the council during the period of rush.
