**The taming of the Cats. By the Lafayette gap.**

By Steve Soud '84

Football returned to Davidson on a sour note Saturday as Lafayette soundly defeated the Wildcats 14-7. True to form, the
many stadium-seat students and quarterbacks (myself included) turned out in force after the game to criticize and speculate over the
Wildcat game plan. Let’s get down to the nitty-gritty of why Davidson lost, and perhaps how Davidson could have won.

The first Leopard touchdown came just before the first quarter buzzer, off an interception. Bob Sharoff picked off a Keith
Martin pass at the 33-yard line. In the second half, the Leopards appeared to be wearing down offensively and defensively
as the Cats halted Lafayette scoring and did a little scoring of their own. The opening of the second half
left little doubt that the close of the game was to be little different from the first half. Davidson couldn’t
move the ball, and when it had to punt, the kick was blocked.

The Leopards worked their way to the Davidson 25, but then went for the first down on fourth and six.
They blew the play, and people were left wondering if Lafayette had a placekicker on the roster. A couple of
possessions later, the Wildcats finally flexed their muscles. Key completions and clutch running moved the Cats to first and goal
at the 6, and a few plays later Mickey Dillon bolted the remaining five yards for the TD.

Interceptions are going to be thrown, and a good pass pattern is designed to beat even good coverage. The Wildcat
secondary is no slouch, either. In fact, on Lafayette’s possession, Keith Ellis picked off a Leopard pass. Turnover count: 1-1.
As Davidson took over the ball, the team displayed what is becoming part of their offense. On second-and-eight, Keith Martin
fumbled and Lafayette recovered the ball. One play down the drain.

The Wildcats have fumbled twelve times, losing only four, equal to what their opponents have lost. But what about those
eight lost plays? The defense has got to lose a little something when, as in this play, they pick off
a pass and then turn around only to watch the offense go nowhere, partially because of the fumble. And what
happened when Davidson had to punt? A 38-yard return of a 39-yard punt. The offense may as well have fumbled
the ball away—it would have saved the special team’s energy! Thanks in part to three fourth-and-inches conversions to first downs,
the Leopards marched downfield and into the endzone for a 14-0 lead.

Clearly, the story of the first half had been Lafayette’s domination of the trenches. Their offensive line was beating our
defensive line. The Leopards ran and passed with relative ease. Head Coach Ed Farrell was not so quick to agree
with that analysis. “They didn’t control the offensive line as much as it appeared. We didn’t run to the right
places. Still, we’re dealing with missed blocking assignments. In the last two drives, we handled their defensive front rather well
and had a fair amount of success both running and passing.”Wayne Paymer nailed the PAT, and Davidson was in the
game 14–7. When the Cats had the ball back midway through the 4th quarter, they capitalized on a tired Lafayette
front line. Ray Sinclair rushed for two first downs, and Bob Miller a third as the Cats moved into scoring
range. On the next play, Sinclair managed only two yards, but finally, a break came Davidson’s way as the ref
called unsportsmanlike conduct on a Leopard late hit. That moved the ball to the 14-yard line, which is a good
position to be in. If you can’t get the ball in the end zone, you can get the ball inside
the four and have four more downs to work with. At that point, a touchdown and a two-point conversion win
the game. But Coach Farrell, in a conservative move, opted to run the ball four times. True, more passes are
intercepted inside the twenty than on any other place on the field, but four carries seem to be going overboard.
On fourth and three, the ball went to Sinclair, but this time the defensive surge got him. The Leopards took
over the helm with 4:47 on the clock. Here’s what Farrell said about the series: “We had gone the whole
way on the run. We made four yards running the ball, and on second down we ran for two. My
only decision I think was on the 4th down play.”

Coach Farrell enumerated his choices as follows: “1) A counter (fake to Ray, give elsewhere), 2) Play action pass (fake
to Ray, put the ball up), or 3) Give it to Ray, the ‘bread and butter player.’ I made the
decision. We came up a foot short,” Farrell said.

With possession of the ball, Lafayette looked to grind out the clock on the ground. The Wildcats did their best
to help their guests, with two penalties assessed for 20 yards against them. But Mike Jones came up with a
key 3rd down sack, and Davidson called time out to stop the clock at 0:58. That gave the Cats time
enough to stage another miracle comeback, but a roughing the kicker foul ended those hopes.

“In reviewing what I did,” Coach Farrell concluded, “it’s obvious without question I made the wrong call—we didn’t make the
first down. In looking at the films, had we executed properly, the counter play would have gotten the first down.
However, so would the play we called if we had executed properly. I don’t second-guess myself much.”

Fine, but the team is 1–2, and why? Davidson is winning the first down war 67–45, losing only in penalty
first downs (4 to 8). The Cats are outrushing opponents by over 150 yards. Outpassing by 45. So why are
the points for 36 and the points against 67? First, special teams aren’t helping. Davidson has not returned the ball
one full yard. Opponents have rolled up 104 yards on return. Opponents have picked off four Wildcat passes and gained
45 yards in the process. And in the penalty category, the Cats are on their way to doubling what they
give as opposed to what they get. All this has got to stop. The coaching staff and players have to
take advantage of their two-week furlough and work on these points if they wish to beat Bucknell.

Lafayette defensive backs try to strip Davidson’s Yermetz of the ball but had to settle for a tackle.
