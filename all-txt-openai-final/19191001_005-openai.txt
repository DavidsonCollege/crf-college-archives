“These Rats Wouldn't Eat My Best Grain,” Says Fred Lamb.

It's hard to keep rats out of a feed store. Tried for years. A neighboring store sold me some RAT-SNAP.

best grain when I threw RAT-SNAP around.” Three sizes, 25¢, 50¢, $1.00. Sold and guaranteed by Mooney Hardware Co. and
White Drug Co.

was sent back to get his gun.

Farewell, my own, in silence I groan. Our parting I bear with resigned air, but still I'm glad, the furniture
looks like a bat and I did it.all myself with SAY IT WITH FLOWERS
