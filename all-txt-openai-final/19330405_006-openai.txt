THE DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 5, 1933

Wildkittens Defeat Cornelius High 13-6

Doc Unger’s Wildkitten baseball club opened their season auspiciously when they batted hard to down the Cornelius High School nine,
13 to 6, in a free-hitting game on the latter’s grounds March 28. Hank Loftin, Davidson shortstop, led the attack
with the willow that shelled two Cornelius pitchers for ten hits and thirteen runs. The Cornelius team could get but
five bingles off the combined offerings of Richardson, Sanders, and Jenkins, but two of these went for circuit clouts, and
coupled with three Davidson miscues led to the six runs scored by them. For the opening game, both teams fielded
very well, and the ’Kitten moundsmen looked especially good. Numerous substitutions were used throughout the game, Coach Unger giving his
entire squad a chance to show what they could do.

Score by innings:
Cornelius Hi ----- 000 003 030—6 5 3
Davidson Fr. ----- 002 065 030—13 10 3

Batteries: Sherrill, Parker, and Howard; Richardson, Sanders, Jenkins, and Parker.

Gastonia Rifle Club Beaten by Davidson

Shooting with deadly precision, the Davidson rifle team defeated the Gastonia Rifle Club, 892 to 863, last Tuesday night at
the Davidson Armory. Dickson McLean of Davidson and Frieze of Gastonia tied for high scoring honors with 184 out of
a possible 200. Frieze is an accomplished shot, having placed second in the national matches held at Camp Perry last
year. Last week the rifle team engaged in competition with leading rifle teams of the country for the highly prized
Hearst trophy. This prize is given annually to the team turning in the highest score. Individual rewards are also given
for the 10 highest scores turned in. G. L. Green, J. D. McLean, F. H. Scott, E. T. McConnell, and
B. O. Simpson are the men that shot in the match last week for Davidson. Gastonia’s team consisted of the
following men: Frieze, McConnell, Parker, McLean, and Reid.

BEARD TALKS ON MODERN THOUGHTS ABOUT HISTORY

(Continued from page 1)

development of history as thought, and to deal with history from the viewpoint of contemporary thought. Three hundred years ago,
he began, there was a constant struggle between theologians on one side and scientists on the other. The theologians, representing
all branches of learning, drew their conclusions from inherited teachings, while the scientists, not content to accept the teachings and
findings of others, instituted research, study, and experiment as a positive base for their teachings. The scientists advanced much more
than did the theologians. They inquired into the history of the earth and all things related thereto. Then came the
application and development of science.

Upon observing the progress of the scientists, the historians decided to follow their example in the study of the thoughts
and acts of man. They would put away philosophy and prejudice, and observe facts. From these facts they would draw
their conclusions. This action was a revolution in thought. The medieval historian had referred events, such as the rise and
fall of a nation, to a divine plan. History to him was a divine plan, and every event fitted into
the plan.

When science was applied to history, history became secular. Historians studied earthlyaffairs. They connected every earthly event to another such
event. They formulated a theory of earthly causes. Thus all history became positive and secular. It sought its explanations in
earthly and sur-

As time went on, historians became more scientific. They overlooked moral requirements or evaluation, and sought to describe the past
as it was. In the middle of the nineteenth century, especially after Darwin, the boldest thinkers in history concluded that
their great philosophical task was to erect a science of history. They sought to bring all actuality of the past
under a formula or law. Every good historian has dreamed of making a science of history. Many thought that they
had done so. They sought some clue to human conduct, but it has never been realized that a science of
history would cover all human affairs. However, they are trying to write in causal chains. Mr. Beard asserted that causal
chains, once established, will not explain anything. If they would, why can historians not predict future action? The historian is
able to arrange the past very satisfactorily, but future thoughts about history are deterministic and can do nothing.

Contemporary historians are entering upon a new era of thought. They are trying to find a way to do so.
Assume that the laws of physics are the important element in human affairs. Suppose we cannot make a science of
history—are we then hopelessly lost? We are not lost simply because we cannot make a science of history. We cannot
see why an event happened; we can only describe the conditions which made the event possible. We cannot even explain
these conditions.

The modern historian has surrendered the idea of finding any formula which would bring together the present, past, and future.
Such a discovery is not probable, to say the least. The modern historian says to humanity: “You stand always on
the unknown precipice of the future. It is full of choices, contingencies, and virtues.” Suppose, said Mr. Beard, that there
was a science of history. Then we could predict the future. We should see ourselves imprisoned in future events, and
find ourselves unable to do as we chose. The science of history is impossible to us. We cannot know facts
as they actually were, because the past is closed. We cannot recover feelings and ideas, and we cannot, therefore, write
history that is actual and scientific. We can, however, pick from the past that which we can use for building
the future. History is great not because it was good but because it inspired the present. History is a science
which brings all the celestial phenomena under a few formulae. Scientists of this new era are: (1) are we required
to assume that the laws of physics are the important element in human affairs? (2) suppose we cannot make a
science of history—are we then hopelessly lost? (3) we are not lost simply because we cannot make a science of
history. We cannot see why an event happened; we can only describe the conditions which made the event possible. We
cannot even explain these conditions.
