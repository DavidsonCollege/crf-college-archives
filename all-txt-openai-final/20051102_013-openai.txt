Women’s XC: SoCon Champions
By WILL BRYAN
Staff Writer

They knew it would be close. In fact, the Chattanooga women’s cross country team was favored to win the Championship going into the Conference meet this past weekend. In the end, it came down to one point that lifted the Davidson women to first place overall and the title of Conference champions. The championship was the second in three years because the Wildcats also took home the trophy in 2003.

As they have been all season, the team was led by four-time Southern Conference Runner of the Week and co-captain Brenna Burns ’08. She finished second overall with a time of 17:48.93, a time that set a Davidson school record. This season, as only a sophomore, Burns has received numerous SoCon Runner of the Week awards as well as SoCon Runner of the Month for September. Burns was followed by fellow co-captain Allie Martin ’06 and Megan Atias ’08, who both also finished within the top five finishers at the meet. Martin completed the 5K course in third place with a time of 18:01.55, and Atias recorded a 18:19.78 to secure fifth place overall.

“We had the goal in mind, and everyone did what was necessary to get the job done.” --Brenna Burns ’08

Harden leads cross country to fourth place

In men’s cross country, Davidson raced to a fourth place finish overall in the conference with their top runner being Lance Harden ’09, who turned in a time of 25:56.07, strong enough for 16th place overall. It was Harden’s second best finish of the 2005 season, the best coming at the Paul Short Run on Oct. 1. Combined with his stellar performances throughout the season, his performance in this year’s Conference meet earned him the award of Southern Conference Freshman of the Year. Jonathan Baker ’06 and Austin Mercadante ’06 rounded out the top three Wildcat runners in the 8K run at Southern Links Golf Club in Statesboro. Baker completed the 8K course in 25:58.09; Mercadante, in 26:05.50.

Appalachian State took first place in the meet, with 46 points. Jonathan Baker ’06 (right) and Austin Mercadante ’06 (left) ran good races of 25:58.09 and 26:05.59, respectively, to help the ’Cats to fourth place. Harden remains a phenomenal story on a team with such strong leadership, as his goals for the season were merely to be eligible to go to the Conference meet in which he ended being the top Davidson runner. “In large part,” said Harden, “I think my individual success and the success of the team can be attributed to the leadership of our two seniors, Austin and Jonathan. They both set the bar high in terms of commitment, and the whole team has fed off of their pace-setting during workouts and races.”

Runners Sam Morris ’08 and Alex Hoyt ’09 had their best finishes of the season, coming in 26th and 32nd overall. Morris ran a 26:17.71, while Hoyt completed the course with a time of 26:40.20.Like the women, the men’s cross country squad will be able to compete one more time at the regional meet on Nov. 12, when they will look to continue their success and have one more shot at eclipsing their personal bests and leading the Wildcats.

Emily King ’09 and Caroline Sanker ’09 finished in 17th and 19th, respectively, with times of 19:02.71 and 19:04.56, securing the winning points for the Wildcats. Davidson won the meet with 46 points. Chattanooga ran a close second with 47, and further behind the top two schools, Appalachian State rounded out the top three with 75 points. Burns, Martin, and Atias secured All-SoCon honors for their performances at the meet.

“We knew we all had to bring it together and formulate the perfect race to finish ahead of such an impressive team [in Chattanooga],” said Burns. “We had the goal in mind, and everyone did what was necessary to get the job done.”

More accolades were added to the Wildcat resume as coach Jen Straub was tabbed as the Southern Conference Coach of the Year for the third time in four years. During her six years at Davidson, Straub has now had six All-SoCon runners on her team. The Southern Conference championship does not mark the ultimate goal for the 'Cats as they now look to compete in the NCAA Regional Championships in Greenville on Nov. 12. After the outstanding performances throughout this fall season, it stands to reason that the Wildcats will make a strong showing in those regionals as they will try to earn a top spot in the National Championships.

“The Conference race made our team so excited for Regionals,” Burns said. “We should expect to go out there and mix it up with nationally ranked teams and make our best Regional showing in Davidson history.”
