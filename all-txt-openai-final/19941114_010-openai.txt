**Flyin’ Mice takes purist approach to Live Monday performance**

By Dave Williard

There comes a time in every student’s education when a low point has been achieved. Well, for me, Monday night took the prize. For those of you who attended Flyin’ Mice on the third installment of the Union’s Live Mondays series, you know how marginal the sound was. And guess which sound guy blew all those amps? Yours truly, thank you.

I felt so awful as I was walking home Monday night, thinking that I had agreed to write a review of the performance. Oh, what a humbling experience in every way...

Flyin’ Mice is a group of experienced, talented musicians. In the face of mounting sound difficulties, the band excels at three-part harmonies and has a lock on the rhythm section. The drummer for this band is simply amazing—his polished musicianship propelled Flyin’ Mice into some intense jamming. It’s exciting to see such good musicians responding to one another, really listening to the music.

The intricacies of Flyin’ Mice’s style come in their judicious use of banjo and mandolin. Coupled with strong acoustic guitar playing, the nuances of their songs are both crisp and fluid. Many other bands would be satisfied to wash this music away with distortion pedals, but Flyin’ Mice takes a purist stance toward rock that elevates their material to a higher, more artistic level. If you are interested in seeing this band again, they play regularly down at Jack Straw’s.

We’ve all read those articles that yell at students for not being peppy enough at sporting events, and I don’t want to sound whiny. But I have a bone to pick with students about the attendance at Live Mondays. Unfortunately, only about 80 to 100 regulars come to Live Mondays. Consider this: the bands at Union concerts are usually much better than those that play on the court, and the 900 Room offers a superior listening atmosphere. We as students get sucked into the homogenous social life here, and Live Mondays offers an outlet to watch personalities that don’t normally hang around Davidson. Make a point to expand your minds and attend the next Monday performance in a few weeks.

When I was asked to write an article on the AIDS Awareness Benefit Talent Show, I rolled my eyes and thought, “Oh no, not another talent show.” I expected a calamity of silly tricks and stunts that I had experienced in high school. It’s not that I do not enjoy watching four guys dressed in drag singing Madonna’s “Like a Prayer” or someone attempting to guzzle a bucket of liquid Jello. It’s just that seeing something like that once is enough. I was pleasantly surprised to see that my assumptions were wrong. This time I saw a show with some true talent.

As I walked into the 900 Room, I saw some impressive artworks on display. The works, in general, were very rich.in color and craft. Although I know little about the intricacies of visual art, I could tell that these pieces were representative of some very gifted and creative artists. Ashley Atkins and Joanna Boyd opened up singing their original work, “A Few Bar Chairs and a Dance Floor.” They entranced the audience with their melodic voices and catchy guitar work. Tiese Manigo did a modern dance routine to the song, “Will You Be There?” She started crouched to the floor, and as the pace of the song quickened, she moved up and out with large, bold arm and leg motions. She was a visual artist of a different variety, painting a story with her body. Geoff Graham used his guitar to entertain with a selection of some of his country songs. “Ten Miles Out of Jackson” was one of his most emotional and lyrically interesting songs. He took to the comical side of country music with his last song, “Rebound Man,” which was short and strikingly funny. Angela Letizia, solo cellist, played J.S. Bach’s Adagio, bringing out the somber moodiness of the piece beautifully. Adagio complimented Amber Sharick’s dark, sensual poetry. In many of her poems, she examines the powerful weight and need of poetry in life. She is truly a rising talent in the Davidson Community. Rachel Newcomb, a well-known poetic talent on campus, once again read her well-crafted and wonderfully creative poetry, bringing it to life for her audience. One of her poems, “The Writer’s Club,” gracefully

On Thursday, November 17, at 8 p.m. in Love Auditorium, the Davidson College Symphony Orchestra will present their first-ever concert. With Assistant Professor of Music Richard Prior conducting, the first Davidson College Symphony Orchestra features 40 musicians who will be performing Copland’s Fanfare for the Common Man, Bach’s Brandenburg Concerto #5, and Mozart’s Symphony #29 in A Major. The Bach Concerto will feature soloists Cynthia Lawing on harpsichord and Charlotte Symphony Orchestra violinist Jane Hart and flutist Jennifer Dior. Lawing will be performing on the music department’s new harpsichord, a double manual instrument built by Boston.

Members of the new orchestra come from a wide spectrum of the college population. Most are non-music majors who never had the opportunity at Davidson for this forum for performance. “With the choir, wind ensemble, and chamber groups, the addition of the orchestra provides Davidson with a comprehensive performance forum. The formation and debut of the orchestra is an exciting and significant event in the life of the college,” Prior says. “Our own faculty provides professional soloists such as Cynthia Lawing and James Swisher; to work with people of that caliber is a very rewarding experience for the students. We also look forward to featuring student soloists in future programs.”

In his native England, Prior was the principal conductor of the Nottingham University Symphony Orchestra, the Nottingham Philharmonia Orchestra, and the Nottingham University Chamber Choir and Orchestra. At Davidson, he is an Assistant Professor of Music as well as the Composer-in-Residence. Next spring’s concert will feature James Swisher, Pianist-in-Residence, as the soloist for Grieg’s Piano Concerto.
