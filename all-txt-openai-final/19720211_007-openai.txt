MONDAY NIGHT

Four IMAC Powers Remain

By HOWARD BOYD
Asst. Sports Editor

The Betas, Watts II, Delt 2, and Porter's reached the semifinals of the IMAC basketball tourney Wednesday.

In quarterfinal action, the Betas edged SPE 62-60, Porter's turned back the SAEs 74-62, Delt 2 whipped Emanon 1 60-52,
and Watts II nipped Delt I 73-71 in overtime.

Thursday, the Betas met WII and Porter's tangled with Delt 2 in semifinal play, with the two winners advancing to
Monday's championship game.

Jeff Lynn swished in a 25-foot shot as the Betas tied the score at 60-all before Lynn's shot. The E's
came from behind to tie all with a minute left, but Frank Clark popped in six quick points to send
the top-seeded team winging into the semifinals.

Howard Arbuckle’s jumper early in the second quarter gave Porter's a lead at 21-20 which they never relinquished, after spotting
the E's an 8-3 lead.

Clark tallied 22 points to spark Porter's balanced attack. He was followed by Tim Winter with 18, John Porter with
17, and Arbuckle with 14. Eldon Basham led the losers with 19, while Peyton Prospere tossed in 17.

Delt 2 roared off to a 19-4 first-quarter lead and never allowed Emanon to get within six points again as
they won with surprising ease. The Delts led 35-22 at halftime and stretched out to a 47-35 edge at the
third-quarter mark. Emanon staged a mild rally to cut the lead to six, 58-52, but could not get any closer.

Dennis Cholak topped the winners’ scoring with 17 points, followed by Randy Ely's 12, Scott Nicholson's 11, and Edgar Weir
with 10. John Simms led the losers as he poured in 30 points. Eddie Johnston added 12 for the SPEs.

Andy Davis netted 22 points, including seven straight down the stretch, before suffering a hip injury late in the game.
His status is doubtful for the rest of the tournament, which could cripple the Delts’ chances.

In Wednesday's nightcap, Mark Rodgman’s shot with 40 seconds left in overtime provided the winning margin for Watts II, as
Greg Sikes’ last-second shot rimmed off.

The Delts surged from behind an 18-point fourth-period deficit to tie the game 69-all on Ted Ellett’s tap-in with seconds
left in regulation, then blew a chance to win it outright as their last-gasp attempt missed.

Juan Sanchez’s jumper early in overtime made it 71-69, then Rodgman connected to cinch the victory. Ellett's follow shot with
26 seconds left cut the final margin to two.

Rodgman once again led the freshmen in scoring as he pumped in 26 points, while Sanchez bombed in 21 from
outside. Greg Sikes sparked the losers with 22, and brother Mike added 14. Drew White chipped in 12.

Monday's first-round games featured the SPEs' win over Fanny & Mabel and Delt 2 knocking off Keeter’s 59-52.

Simms poured in 30 points to lead the SPEs to a 61-52 win over F & M. Tony Martin and
Rollie Sumwalt led the losers with 15 and 23, respectively.

Delt 2 blitzed Keeter’s 26-7 in the fourth stanza as they rallied from a 37-31 deficit to win going away
56-44. Andy Davis’ four consecutive buckets keyed a 16-0 burst as the Delts broke it open.

In other first-round action, the E's routed Pax II 92-43 behind Peyton Prospere's 23-point performance, and Greg Sikes broke loose
for 37 points as Delt I slipped past the Taus 72-67. Mitchell Johnson netted 24 for the Taus.
