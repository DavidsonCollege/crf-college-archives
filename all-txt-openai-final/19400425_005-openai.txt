SPRING FROLIC SPONSORS

These men and their dates will all be in the figure that is always part of the Friday night formal
dance. Leading the figure will be Paul Marion, the president of the council. (Photo Courtesy, Charlotte Observer).

Alternates Chosen

Alternates, chosen by each of Davidson's nine social fraternities, and their dates will take part in the figure at the
formal dance of “Spring Frolics” Friday night. Those couples will be:

Beta Theta Pi: Miss Irma Dell Blackstone with Tom McKnight; Kappa Alpha: Miss Helen Foster with Ross Glidden; Kappa Sigma:
Miss Marjorie Crisp with Stuart Oglesby.

Also, Phi Delta Theta: Miss Nancy Cleveland with Tommy Glenn; Pi Kappa Alpha: Miss Frances Halbum with Jim McDonald.

Also, Pi Kappa Phi: Miss Dot Branan with Julian Lokey; and Sigma Phi Epsilon: Miss Midge Salley with Bob Doty;
Sigma Alpha Epsilon: Miss Margery Wilson with Tom Crichton.

These couples will join with members of the Pan-Hellenic Council in presenting the figure, which is expected to be the
highlight of Friday night's dance. The selection of an alternate to accompany the Pan-Hellenic representative of each fraternity has for
years been a social custom at Davidson.

The formal dance at which the figure will be featured will be one of four dances in the “Spring Frolics”
set. Music for the set will be supplied by Johnny Long, Charlotte-born leader and swing stylist of note. Three featured
singers are included in Long’s organization.

The figure will be danced amid a setting bearing out the Spring theme. Novel lighting effects will be used, and
Long has been asked to prepare special selections for the event.

Father: “Mary, who was that man I saw kissing you last night?”
Mary: “What time was it?”

Then there was the freshman co-ed who wanted to know if a neckerchief was the head of a sorority house.

Customer: Waitress, what is wrong with these eggs?
Waitress: I don’t know. I only laid the table.

“I called the operator on the phone today, for fun and just said, ‘Hello, give me Heaven’.”
“And what happened?”
“Well, that isn’t exactly what she gave me.”

Girls are like snowballs — the harder you squeeze them the faster they melt.

Once there was a fellow who smoked so many Camels that his nerves got so steady that he couldn’t move.

“My parrot is a hundred and ten years old!”
“He’s awfully green for his age.”

At least you could smile when you read these jokes; your grandfather did.
