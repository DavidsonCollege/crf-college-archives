(Continued from page 3)
wrote last week that Professor
Drake, the head of the sociology
department when he was hired
and the department chairman
for most of his time at Davidson,
was never consulted during his
evaluation process.

But the Administration is not
solely at fault. The faculty has
shirked its responsibility. Also,
if professors wish to criticize the
Administration, they must be
willing to actively participate in
the evaluation process.

Yet the faculty constantly
refuses to approve a faculty
evaluation committee which,

(Continued from page 1)
required action by those not
wishing to participate. The
system for this summer’s bill is
“the only alternative,” Mary-
nowski said.
Comptroller Robert Davidson
said the problem is that PIRG
is an “organization apart from
the school, and it’s hard to
justify including the PIRG dues
on the bill’s total.” However,
“we’re happy to collect the
money” and include informa-
tion in the bill.

“As long as it is parents
rather than students who are
confronted with the decision as

PIRG

would review appointments and
conduct evaluation independent
of the Academic Vice President.

Professors are afraid to judge
their peers or to be judged
themselves. But only by allow-
ing themselves to be publicly
scrutinized can they improve
and learn.

Students also are neither
critical nor skeptical, in part
because of Davidson's atmos-
phere. Professors often do not
demonstrate any attempt for
meaningful input. Yet students’

to whether PIRG merits their
support, the number of stu-
dents who take an active in-
terest is likely to be rather
small,” he said.

Currently, the Davidson
PIRG chapter is investigating
Representative Jim Martin’s
campaign funding, Marynowski
said. PIRG has not made any
other definite plans for next
year.

Approximately 10-15 stu-
dents are now involved in
PIRG, Marynowski said, add-
ing, “this is a fairly good size
number considering the type of
investigative work we do.”

matter in perspective last

Many people did not like
Charles. He was blunt, or a
soft-spoken, and a purist.
Charles and I differed in our
newspaper philosophy and in
our approach to life. But I
respected him.

Charles was not malicious.
He respected the faculty. He
resigned when he realized the
faculty and students were up-
set. Charles Lloyd put the
matter in perspective when he
said, “All of us ought to be more
loving and considerate. It’s one
joke that backfires. I think most of
us are too touchy. Anybody
who wants to poke fun at me is
welcome.”

forgiveness that the College
