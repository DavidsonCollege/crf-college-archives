Leaders Emerge From 45 IMAC Teams

With IMAC basketball two weeks underway, there are now definite leaders in each division of League A and League B. There are 45 teams competing this year with games being played from 7 p.m. to midnight Sunday through Thursday nights. In last week's action on Monday, powerful PGD #1 disbanded the Soul Patrol 67-46. Then last Sunday, they destroyed a good PDT #2 team 70-39. Monday of this week, the Gamms ripped powerful F&M #1 56-55. Marty Williamson and Chris Young are the leading guns on this unbeaten team as PGD #1 leads League A's division 1 with a 3-0 slate.

Washington and Lee's wrestling team took three out of the last four weight classes and won a close match Friday night against the Davidson wrestling team, 22-18. After forfeiting the 118-pound class, the Cats moved onto the scoreboard with Rob Jacobs and Rob Benton winning 8-5 and 6-2, respectively. John Scandling gave Davidson the team lead at 9-6 with a convincing 8-2 win in the 142-pound weight class. After Rusty Winchester lost in the 150-pound class, Randy Webster turned his opponent over on his back for a two-point predicament and then held on for the 2-0 decision. Davidson's 12-9 lead was short-lived as John Kennelly was pinned. Kennelly had the lead and was in control before he was pinned. Charlie Hollaway hoped to repeat last week's winning performance against Catawba, but he ran into a much stronger opponent from Washington and Lee and was defeated 15-4. In the critical match of the night, Charlie Dorsey came from behind and almost pinned his opponent, but he was taken down in the last period and lost 9-7. With an insurmountable 22-12 lead, Washington and Lee refused to wrestle their heavyweight and forfeited to Bill Garrett, who thus became Davidson's only victor in the last four matches. Each team won five bouts, but Washington and Lee won the match because they were able to get one six-point pin and one four-point major decision. Davidson could only get three-point decisions other than the forfeit. Rob Benton said that "Washington and Lee wrestled very defensively, which makes it difficult to turn a man onto his back." The wrestling team is in Raleigh tonight to wrestle N.C. State, who beat Washington and Lee Monday 24-14. The next home match is January 30 at 7:30 p.m. against another ACC team, the University of North Carolina.

The Cleveland Indians, one of the best conglomerates of freaks ever seen on the courts, are definitely a power to be reckoned with as they are also 3-0 in League A's division 1. The remnants of defending champion Watts I plus Dennis Cholak and Jack Willits make a deep, strong team that looks to be the best of a balanced two leagues. So far they have beaten W1-A 98-51, the KAs 63-33, and crushed the Crankateers 79-39. The dark horse in this division of League A is definitely Emanon. With Gordon Glasgow, "Foul ball" Frank Folger, and Calvin Allen, the nonames are a real strength to contend with. They come in at 3-0 also. Last Monday they shot down the already turned-off Crankateers 55-38 without BUCKY AND CAPTAIN AMERICA (Staff photo by Goodman) ROLLING AND TUMBLING Cat grapplers prepare for their upcoming NC State match.

Glasgow. Then on Sunday at full strength they sent the WI1-A wimps back to the dorms at 41-37. On Tuesday they got their third win as they rebelled against the KAs to walk away in a 61-43 victory.

In Division 2 of League A, the Delts, who are sporting five teams (jock fraternity?), have a real fine one in PDT 1. Delt #1 is 3-0 and they have taken an average victory margin of 20 points in their three wins. Last Tuesday their balanced attack shut "US" up 47-34. Then on Sunday they crushed Loo Kat Mee 60-36 and finished up Wednesday by slugging it out with PAX #1 before running away at 61-46. The Delts don't give many second shots as their tough 2-1-2 zone D has only given up 38.7 pts./game.

The SPEs, with one of the most organized and determined teams in the league, are also 3-0 as they look to one of the top players in IMAC ball, John "Duke" Sims. Sims is the leading scorer in both leagues with a 22.5 average as he has led the SPEs to wins over Loo Kat Mee, PAX A, and US, all victories coming by about 20 point margins.

Ah yes, there is also the loosest team in the world in this division, the PKAs #1. Coach Jim "Low-low" Lowry and his defensive coordinator Tommy "the beached whale" Verlin have piloted this team of fraternity cast-offs to a perfect 3-0 slate. The PKAs wheezed past the Old Men, cruised by Cosbis Cosmos, and then ripped Deals. Coach Lowry, when asked why he has turned so many big leads into squeaker victories, said that, "everybody gets a chance to play on my team." This is evidenced by the fact that nine men have scored in each of the PKA #1's 3 wins.

Due to space and the number of scores that need to be reported, League B will be covered in detail next week. However, now, for the first time in DAVIDSONIAN history, here are the top 10 scorers in League A, compiled by the C.A. and Buck's Sports Bureau. John "Duke" Sims of the world-renowned SPEs leads the rest of the bodies with a 22.5 average. Marty Williamson is in no. 2 with the Gamms at 21.0/game. Next, holding at 3, is Sam Upchurch from US at 20.7. Mark Rodgeman is 4th at 20 pts. for the tribe from Cleveland. After four games it looks like this: 5. C. Young, PGD #1, 18.7. 6. R. Ely, F & M #1, 16.3. 7. E. Willingham, Crankateers, 16.0. 8. D. Harper, PDT #2, 15.5. 9. G. Wiecker, PDT #3, 14.7. 10. J. Sanches, Clev. Indians, 14.3.
