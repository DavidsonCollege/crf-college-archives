Bison stop Davidson; Wildcats challenge record against Tigers
By STEWART RAWSON

The Cats failed to win their third matchup of the year, the second for Davidson as a member of the
Colonial League. The Wildcats took their 0-2 record onto Richardson Field for the home opener against the Bison from Bucknell,
but a timid first half spelled disaster for the struggling Cats. The offense was able to move the ball on
occasion led by quarterback Peter Hughes and strong running from freshman Bryn Robinson, but the big plays just were not
there. The Bison moved the ball well and amassed four touchdowns in the first two periods to raise the tally
to 28-0 at intermission. The defense showed glimmers of hope with strong leadership from sophomore linebacker Kenny Nazemetz, but could
not subdue the methodical running game Bucknell threw at them.

Though the Davidson offense controlled the ball for the majority of the game, each drive seemingly ended with a turnover
or a loss of possession on downs in Bison territory. Short passes from Hughes to his receivers provided most of
the impetus behind Davidson’s offensive success. However, the sole score of the game for the Cats was a second-half field
goal. The final score was Bucknell 34, Davidson 3. Davidson has managed only 10 points in three outings, but the
offense seems to have solved some of its earlier problems.

Comments: A major highlight of the game was the marching splendor of the West Iredell County high school “fighting Comanche”
band at halftime. The young warriors rallied and danced to a strong drum corps, but were outclassed by the antics
of the Davidson Wildcat in the flag line. The Wildcat (A.K.A. Wally of Wally and the Juicemasters) provided a much-needed
dose of comic relief. It was good to see the freshman guys exhibit such boisterous fan support, let’s keep it
up. Everyone needs to head on down to Charlotte’s Memorial Stadium on Saturday for the much-publicized “brain bowl” as the
Cats take on the Princeton Tigers. The kickoff is at 2:00, so put on your tailgatin’ bests, pack up the
fried chicken, and cheer Davidson to victory!

Soccer maintains pressure
By WHIT WILKS

The Cats entered a tough stretch of their 1987 schedule this week, and although both matches resulted in losses, the
team still has high hopes for the remainder of the season. The team played Florida International last Friday on a
sun-drenched field in a matchup of the 7th (F.I.U.) and 9th (D.C.) ranked teams in the South. The squads matched
up evenly, and the game remained scoreless until late in the first half when F.I.U. struck for two quick goals
to take a 2-0 lead into the break. The second half saw a return to balanced play, as the teams
each had their share of opportunities. Davidson came closest to scoring on a tremendous blast off the foot of Tracy
Hankins that hit the crossbar before being cleared by the defense. The Cats could not put one behind the goalie,
however, and fell 2-0.

Wednesday the team headed south to Columbia to face the nationally ranked Gamecocks at the ‘Graveyard.’ The Cats paid no
heed to the polls and played U.S.C. evenly for the first forty minutes before giving up an own-goal just before
the half. The team was not discouraged, and again played well in the first portion of the second half. Neither
unit could muster a serious threat until Carolina did get a second goal with thirty minutes remaining in the contest.
Trailing 2-0, the Cats did not fold; rather they maintained the high level of pressure on the ball which they
displayed all game. However, U.S.C. was not to be held down on this day and registered two additional scores before
the conclusion of the match. The score was somewhat deceiving, as the Cats clearly were on the same level as
their highly regarded opponents. The Cats play the alumni this afternoon before hitting the road to take on the Demon
Deacons in Winston-Salem on Wednesday.

Volleyball team claws
By KATHRYN MITCHEM

The Volleyball team, although they lost to Marshall Tuesday night, fought hard and played well. They are no longer a
team to be ignored, as Marshall found out early. According to coach Hawkins, the lady Wildcats “took them by surprise,
grabbing the lead for a while in the first game.” Marshall was not allowed to claim their victory without a
good fight. In the first game, there were several long rallies and many series of side-outs without points scored. In
the next two games, “we dug a hole for ourselves, letting Marshall get a big lead,” said Hawkins, “but instead
of completely folding, we came back, scoring a few points yet many side-outs.” Ellen Ott hada great match hitting and
passing, and Peggy Tietgen did an equally super job of blocking. In addition, coach Hawkins commended the play of Molly
Graver, saying, “Molly... contributed greatly coming off the bench in all three games.”

A review of the 1987 NFL season - By ANTHONY MCCARRON

Now that the NFL walkout is official, what are we pro football fans going to do except rant and rave
about the strike and be angry at everyone including our favorite team? I’m not sure, so forgive me if I
indulge myself in a little ranting. I know, I know, the players have to make their money while they can;
they are involved in a stead of silly seeded “playoff games.”

With most hard-core fans already experiencing withdrawal, the New York Giants are in rough shape. Perhaps they wrote too many
books in the off-season. Simms to McConkey, LT, and a performance by Redskins backup quarterback, Doug Williams. The Falcons pulled
quite a switch from week one, when they were crushed by Tampa Bay, 48-10. '87 football has already given us
a few among many. It seems the New boys in blue were too busy pumping typewriter keys to pump any
iron. “The off-season distractions won't bother us,” they said. Sure, but after looking like a troop of girl scouts in
