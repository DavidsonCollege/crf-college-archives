Students encouraged to participate

The new Davidson College Constitution calls for the formation of a Media Board to govern student publications. This board consists of three student members chosen by the SGA Senate, three members chosen by the administration and faculty, and three members chosen by these six.

The SGA has approved a selection process for the choosing of the three student members. One member will be chosen by the Media and two by an open process.

Students interested in the Media at Davidson College are encouraged to apply for the Media Board positions. Pick up an application in the Dean of Students Office, and return it there by Friday, January 14.
