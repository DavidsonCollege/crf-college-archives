Professors present list of books for many fields

Editor’s note: In May 1978, the Center for Special Studies solicited reading lists from the Davidson faculty to introduce students
to the various fields of study offered at Davidson College. The contributors were asked to recommend three to five books
to readers who know little or nothing about the different academic disciplines or specialties. Dean of the Center Robert Avinger
wrote The Davidsonian, “The list is an excellent vehicle for introducing anyone to a variety of academic fields. Students, in
particular, may find in these readings an opportunity to clarify and broaden their own intellectual interests and career plans." The
book list which follows is the result of Avinger’s survey.
