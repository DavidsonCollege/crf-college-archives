THE DAVIDSONIAN, FEBRUARY 12, 1931

Book Review

Mata Hari. By Major Thomas Coulson. Harper & Brothers, publishers, New York. 1930. 312 pp.

“In your soul and in your conscience are you convinced that this woman is guilty of having communicated information and documents to the enemy, and having caused the death of many of our soldiers?” Very calmly and without hesitation each officer replied, “Yes.”

As the sentence of death was read to her that pleasant June evening, did Mata Hari, notorious German war spy, hear from the shades of desolation and terror the trampling of ghostly feet, as a phantom army paraded; that group of fifty thousand men who had been sent to their death as the direct result of her treachery. From early in 1914 the Red Dancer and her partner, Death, strode together from stage to stage. From early in the morning of the 10th day of June, 1917, Death alone, smiling grimly, continued the way.

Many legends have been woven around the almost magic name of Mata Hari. A pupil of Marie Anne Lesser, this girl of Dutch descent became one of the most dangerous of enemy spies. England and France were not unaware of her actions. Yet they were powerless, for among the lovers of Mata Hari were to be found ambassadors, ranking officers, and some of the highest officials of France, Spain, and other countries. In anguish, the intelligence department sought definite and conclusive evidence by which they might convict. It remained for the woman to betray herself through her vanity.

In a clear-cut authoritative fashion, Major Coulson reveals the true facts about Mata Hari. Romance, glamour, legend—all are laid aside and a cold directness used. Apparently, the author is in a position to speak with a certainty rising from sure knowledge, else much he says would have to be omitted. The book is only fairly well written, but because of the nature of the subject, the reader is held spellbound from cover to cover.

Three Sons, Titans. Emil Ludwig. Putnam’s New York, 1930. 356 pp. $3.50.

Michelangelo, Rembrandt, and Beethoven—Three Titans. Look at the three heads and you have the daemonic affinity. Michelangelo receives by far the most satisfying treatment. One is at once fascinated and charmed when this first chapter is finished, and it is with genuine eagerness that one looks to the second and third. The life of the famed sculptor is slowly traced from earliest childhood. Many seemingly insignificant details are brought in to lend strength to the portrait. It is noticeable throughout that Ludwig has a way of bringing out the greatness of his subjects by a subtle underrating or disparaging of contemporaries. This method is successful here, for certainly his Titans seem supreme.

In the study of Rembrandt, Ludwig seems to picture a man who became a master in spite of himself. Rembrandt strove for luxury, but found it only part of the time. Though much of his life was filled with misery, he seems supremely happy. His overindulgence in the baser things of life perhaps accounts to some extent for the unusual amount of the grotesque found in his works.

One does not feel a full satisfaction from the treatment of Beethoven. Truly a Titan, the great composer rises above his environment. He cannot be held down. The slightest interference may send him into fits of rage. The criticism of this man is too mechanical; it seems to lack true musicianship. One feels as if the story was being forced in order to obtain a certain effect. Graphically, the passing of this famous composer is described. Lying unconscious, Beethoven is roused for a moment by a terrific clap of thunder. Struggling to a sitting position, he turns to his friends and says, “Plaudite, amici, comoedia finita est,” then shaking his fist at the elements he cries out in anguish and slowly sinks back—dead.

On closing the book one might perhaps ask if these characters are not demi-gods. The answer will be—no, not gods, but rather three Titans who accepted battle with the gods.

A Scandinavian Summer. By Harry A. Franck. The Century Company, publishers. New York. 1931.

Harry Franck has spent twenty-five years of his life traveling in tropic and semi-tropic countries. This “Prince of the Vagabonds” decided to cool off for a season in Europe’s far north. He decided to go to Scandinavia. He came back with this book which is fresh with buoyancy. It is as eye-opening as any of the books in the long and honored list of this popular travel-writer.

We shall take for granted the fact that Americans are generally in ignorance of the true life in the Scandinavian countries. We have come to think of these countries as merely possessing beautiful scenery, and are almost in complete ignorance of the peoples themselves. Harry Franck does much in this book to correct this impression. With his genius for making friends among strange people, he goes among the Scandinavians and comes back with a story which is filled with understanding. He has gone to the quaint little hamlets of these people and has emerged with powerful impressions of the true Dane, the true Swede, and the true Norwegian. His adventure has been called an adventure of the spirit rather than an adventure of the flesh. Those who merely seek information will receive much enjoyment from the book as well as those who wish to spend time in this most interesting part of the world.

SEIBERT RECITAL (Continued from page 1)

appearing in concerts and recitals in all of the large musical centers. Probably the most famous church that he appeared in was St. Peters in the Vatican in Rome. At this church, he played several recitals and they were greatly enjoyed by his audiences. The organist of this great church wrote of Mr. Seibert’s playing that, “Greater sentiment could not have been expressed. The technique of which you have manifested mastery is worthy of praise.”

Last season Mr. Seibert appeared before the Buffalo Chapter, American Guild of Organists, in St. Paul’s Cathedral. The dean of the Guild, DeWitt C. Garretson, wrote to Mr. Seibert, “Your recent recital was such a success that your return to Buffalo is simply a matter of the return of another musical season. The members of the chapter who heard you are all enthusiastically singing your praises.”

The last time that Prof. E. J. Cullum, head of the musical department of Davidson, heard him was in the Town Hall in New York. Prof. Cullum was so impressed with his playing that he promised Mr. Seibert an engagement at Davidson.

The following are some of the impressions that he gave where he played: “Recital stupendous in appeal.”—New York Sun. “Organ played in such a way has been a revelation.”—La Perseveranza, Milan, Italy. “It was the best.”—“Never heard more finished work.”—“Seibert is the best.”

Three More Games For Freshman Quint
Will Meet Carolina, N. C. State, and Charlotte Hi, This Month

Three more games remain on the Davidson Freshman basketball schedule. The Wildkittens have yet to meet the yearlings of both Carolina University and State College, and the Charlotte Hi five. Last Tuesday they met a strong Presbyterian Junior College quintet, but the outcome was not known at press time.

The contest with the Carolina Freshmen will be played on Thursday, the 12th, at Chapel Hill, as a preliminary to the Varsity-Carolina game. This foe, since they have subdued everyone they have met, promises to be the toughest the Wildkittens will encounter. On the following night, the 13th, the Kittens journey to Raleigh, where they meet the State yearlings in another preliminary to the Varsity game. The State Freshmen also have a strong team, having been defeated only once during the season, that loss being administered by the Duke Fresh.

On the 20th the Wildkittens close their season by meeting the strong Charlotte Hi quintet on the Davidson court. This game will be the second meeting between the two teams, the high school winning the first on the Charlotte court by a 27-18 score.

Duke 27—Davidson 18
The Davidson Wildcats dropped their first Big Five game on Tuesday night, February 3, to the fast-stepping Duke University quint by the score of 27-18. The Blue Devils, playing before a big crowd of home fans, were met on even terms by the Wildcats in the first half, but pulled out in front in the last half.

George Rogers, Duke forward, opened the scoring in the first minute by sinking a long shot from the right side of the court. The game then went scoreless for nine minutes before Goodson found the basket and tied the score, 2-2. Duke held the lead throughout the game except for a few minutes of the first half after Martin had looped in a field goal to give his team a 7-6 lead. Duke guard, countered with a field goal and thereafter Duke was in the lead, leaving the floor at the half with the slight lead of 12-11. In the second half the work of Shaw and Rogers enabled the Blue Devils to forge into a comfortable lead which was not threatened during the rest of the game.

Shaw of Duke was high point man of the night with a total of 13 points, marking up four field goals and five fouls. He was followed by Martin, Davidson center, who scored four field goals for a total of eight points.
