Little Library Installs Computer Catalog System

By David Smyth

Students returning to Davidson this week, should they see fit to visit the E.H. Little Library, will be greeted by
a new computerized cataloging system, known to its more intimate friends as CHAL.

CHAL is an acronym for “computerized help at Little,” which serves doubly as an honor to Archivist Dr. Chalmers Davidson
’28.

The automation librarian, Sharron Byrd, says that users will be able to find editions in the collection more easily because
of the amount of indexing that can be done on magnetic disks as opposed to monolithic wooden cabinets.

Currently, thirteen terminals are strewn throughout the library, while six more are to be added there and one in the
Cunningham Fine Arts Building to incorporate the music library holdings.

Government documents will be brought into the CHAL family next spring, so some card catalogs still remain for those volumes
and as a monument to our decadent past. Eight of the Wilson Indexes, including the Art Index and the Reader’s
Guide to Periodical Literature, will soon be added to the system. These collections have rather large databases and programmers have
not yet had time to add them to the computers, Byrd noted.

Two IBM and two Macintosh PCs will also be installed to allow for quick transferal of bibliographical information from the
indexes to personal disks.

The checkout procedure will remain the same, as bar codes must be stuck to every volume before a more efficient
system can be installed.

Condoms

Continued from page 1

Terry received a letter from a group of “concerned students” which suggested that the school’s preferred prophylactic was not dependable.

“This is not a case of a single condom having broken,” says the letter, “they break so often they’ve become
a joke on campus. We know this isn’t your fault, but we thought you might like to know.”

The students sent six condoms from the batch sent to Davidson back to the manufacturer, Barnetts, Inc. of Charlotte, for
testing. Along with the condoms, the students enclosed a letter requesting that the sales manager for Barnetts, Robert Buza, contact
the school as soon as the testing had been completed.

In a letter to Terry dated May 24, 1991, Buza noted that the condoms were subjected to tests “in accordance
with ASTM D-3492, Section 7, test procedure.” The test detects “any leakage or weakness in the tensile strength of the
product.”

Buza suggested that the reported problems with the condoms were of an isolated nature, and may have resulted from consumer
misuse of the condoms.

Assistant Dean of Students Leslie Marsicano, who orders the condoms for the college, added in a letter to The Davidsonian
that Davidson distributes the same type of condom circulated by both Planned Parenthood and the Mecklenburg Health Department.

“Brought too much stuff,” Amanda Lesesne of Atlanta, Ga. summed up her biggest fear about coming to Davidson in a
word: “Classes,” she said. Not everyone has these odd anxieties about college. When asked what her biggest fear about Davidson
was, Rebecca Billingsly of Colorado Springs, CO said “I don’t have any more. I’ve been here for about a week.
I want to have a good time. I want to party a lot.”
