**The music of La Maurache transcends time**

By BILL BUGG

In the apparel of medieval minstrels, with the mystery of ancient instruments and intrepid tunes, La Maurache, an early music
ensemble from France, performed a variety of songs, dances, and instrumental works from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance in
Davidson College’s Chamber Music Series Tuesday night. Lingle Chapel in Davidson College Presbyterian Church provided good acoustics and a small
concert hall for the performance, but it was left to the audience to imagine four minstrels seated by a fire
in a medieval chateau, or four composers at the Court of Burgundy putting poetry to the music.

The four musicians, however, transcended the modern environment, creating an atmosphere of the intimacy and informality of a chateau and
the mystery and majesty of a court. La Maurache’s four minstrels, clad in purple and white robes and embracing instruments
ranging from crumhorn to rebec, from lute to crwth, processed down the aisle to begin the performance. They played several
groups of short works ranging from court songs of the Trouveres of Northern France to medieval poetry of Guillaume de
Machaut, from royal anthems of Spain to suites and dances of the French Renaissance.

La Maurache’s interpretation of the often ambiguous scores of ancient pieces was conservative, but innovative. While they attempted to remain
free from tainting the works with 20th-century cliches, their results emitted a radiance of lively rhythms and endless variety. They
made up for their only weakness — some trouble blending the instruments and voices — by their effectiveness in conveying
an ancient art form to a modern audience.

The name La Maurache alludes to the mysterious Moors (Les Maures in French) who brought the lute into Spain. Julien
Skowron, the founder of the ensemble said, “La Maurache is primarily symbolic. We wanted a name for our ensemble which
would express song, instrumental art, dance, and poetry; a living name for a living music which seeks to be something
more than a mere return to the past, a name which belongs both in the past and the present to
denote a nearly one-thousand-year-old music in which every 20th-century man may rediscover... his roots.” The ensemble successfully impelled its audience
to seek through its music not nostalgia but the vividness and freshness of ancient sounds new to the modern ear.

Julien Skowron is an expert in early instruments (including the crwth, rebec, medieval fiddle, and viol) and holds a doctorate
from Sorbonne. Francisco Orozco, from Colombia, specializes in plucked instruments (the oud, maurache, guitar, and lute). Herve Barreau, who plays
wind instruments (the recorder, shawm, crumhorn, and cornamuse), won first prize in the Paris Interconservatory Competition. Jean-Pascal Bertin plays bowed
instruments and the crumhorn. The ensemble has performed in France, Yugoslavia, Denmark, Italy, and the United States.

**Ada Jenkins Day commemorates community worker**

By VICKI ROGERS

YSSC Vice-President junior Lynn Michie had little success enticing children to join her for some “small child stew” this Saturday
in the Haunted House at Ada Jenkins Day. Her two-inch-long green eyelashes or the slimy contents of the “soupe du
jour” may have caused their fear. Those who came to Ada Jenkins Day this past Saturday saw that ‘spooky witch”
(in the words of Damon Barringer, age seven).

Ada Jenkins Day, termed a “Fall Town Day” by Pat Johnson, had a dual purpose, meant to commemorate the accomplishments
of Ada Jenkins. The day’s festivities also demonstrated the Davidson community’s support of the community center and its many programs.
Ada Jenkins taught from the late 1920s until1945 in a two-room schoolhouse situated at the present-day community center location. Jenkins
thought there was a need for a larger school. The school board granted permission for the construction of a new
schoolhouse if Jenkins would raise the money from within the community. Eventually, Jenkins had the funds necessary to build the
schoolhouse, which is now the Community Center. For this achievement, Saturday, October 26, was set aside in remembrance of Jenkins.
The Y Student Service Corps (YSSC) worked with Pat Johnson on the planning of Ada Jenkins Day and provided student
volunteers to organize kids’ games and to help out as clowns. Jobs ranged from supervising the “moon bounce” to helping
three- and four-year-olds try to strike the bell on the “High Riser” with a hammer twice their size. With the
help of Eunice Hiott, one little boy made it past “macho” on the scale. FIJI and Emanon created a two-room
“Haunted House” complete with a vampire (Lee Elchelberger), a chained monster (Andy Myers), and a mad doctor (Mike Stephens). Many
kids left the haunted house screaming. Pat Johnson, organizer of Ada Jenkins Day, said, “I just could not have produced
Ada Jenkins Day without the YSSC, Emanon, and FIJI.” in reference to the small student representation at Ada Jenkins Day.
Steve Hughes expressed his disappointment “that more students didn't turn out because they passed the people on the other side
of the tracks — the real Davidson community, the part that isn’t just an outgrowth of the college.”

Mike Stephens, Ian Dunn, Bill Barnette, and David Sink ponder the next question in a College Bowl match.

Adam’s Rib provides comedy, suspense

By DOUG ROBELEN and CHRIS SULLIVAN

Doug: Hello, I’m Doug Robelen, film critic for The Davidsonian.

Otter: Hi, I’m Otter, ditto.

D: Today we're going out to preview the film “Adam’s Rib.”

O: It’s a comedy starring Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy. The pair star as husband and wife lawyers. He is
in the DA's office and she is a defense attorney.

D: The movie starts out with a suspenseful pursuit scene. For those of you who don't recognize Tracy and Hepburn,
this movie gets pretty confusing pretty quickly.

O: Mrs. Attinger (Jennifer Holiday) is following her husband (Tom Ewell) in an attempt to catch him with (dadadadaaa) another
woman. She discovers the smitten couple on the couch. Enraged, she fires away with her handy dandy .32.

D: We quickly discover that she needs some marksmanship lessons. Well, surprisingly enough, Adam Bonner (Tracy) is assigned to prosecute
Mrs. Attinger. And Amanda Bonner (Hepburn) decides to take the case in the name of women’s equality. This all makes
for an intriguing plot and a humorous one at that.

O: The loving Bonner couple gradually degenerate into an... unloving couple. Under the direction of Mrs. Bonner, the trial becomes
a circus with the issue of equal rights for women in the center ring.

D: After some heavy-handed feminism, the film recovers its early humor. Tracy makes his point to his wife and storms
out. If you're waiting to hear the ending, see the movie.

O: I thought the movie was quite good even though it makes a travesty of the American judicial system. Tracy
and Hepburn put in marvelous performances, and the supporting cast is nearly as good, especially the dude across the hall
(you'll know who I mean).

D: Otter, I must agree with you: Overall, it is a very entertaining movie, definitely worth seeing. Tom Ewell is
great on the stand.
