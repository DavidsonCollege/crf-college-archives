Faculty Members Claim Low Salaries

“In the selection of teachers, (Davidson) must seek individuals of genuine spirituality who are outstanding intellectually, who have the best training available in their fields of study, and whose interest in the students and in teaching is unfeigned and profound. It must also provide these teachers with the time and opportunity for creative scholarship which is fundamental to the best teaching.”
—from Statement of Purpose

Last year Davidson finished “in the black,” and total giving reached almost $3 million by the end of the fiscal year. However, serious financial troubles are predicted for the years ahead by several sources. Faculty salaries and compensation are becoming a tender area at Davidson now. In average compensation, the college paid its professors $23,100; its associate professors $18,100; its assistants $14,600; and its instructors $12,600 over the previous year.

These figures are misleading, however, because faculty compensation includes more than the straight salary that makes up the bulk of week-to-week income. The previous figures were taken from a June 1974 report by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP). Professor of Religion David Kaylor commented that the AAUP figures are about $3000 off the mark when straight salaries are being considered. Faculty compensation includes Social Security, tuition for faculty children, life insurance, and retirement pay.

In addition to inflation, or perhaps partly because of it, the college enrollment boom of the 1960s is slowing to a halt. “In the Sixties enrollments were rising at 9 percent a year; in the early Seventies the increase dropped to below 5 percent. This fall it will probably not exceed 3 percent,” the September 15th issue of Forbes Magazine emphasized. Inflation and decreased college enrollments are two problems that are giving colleges serious financial trouble, and part of the pinch seems to be in the area of faculty compensation. The June 1974 “AAUP Bulletin” writes, “In 1973-1974, for the first time in the history of the survey of faculty compensation, the nation’s faculties actually lost ground economically.”

Davidson may not be having enrollment problems at the moment, but Kaylor and Professor of Philosophy Earl MacCormac are concerned about Davidson’s financial future. MacCormac commented, “Davidson needs a concerted effort to raise at least $50 million in ten years. The only answer to present and future financial problems is effective fund raising, primarily by the president and his fund-raising staff,” he added. MacCormac said that, as far as he knows, no plans for such a fund-raising project exist. He added that $35 million should go to faculty endowment and $15 million should be used for buildings.

Kaylor echoed MacCormac’s sentiments. “If you project our present fund-raising over the next ten years, we need to double our endowment. We’re not even close to that in terms of current fund-raising.” MacCormac warned that if fund-raising is not intensified, the faculty may be forced to unionize. “The faculty here is generally conservative and will not take such measures soon,” he added.

College President Samuel R. Spencer Jr. criticized MacCormac’s ideas about fund-raising but admitted that the coming years will be financially difficult ones for Davidson. “I think some development people talk in rather grandiose terms. Certainly, we will have to have a strong fund program over the next ten years. It’s going to be very difficult for any private college to keep pace, but faculty salary increases will be a first priority item. This is something of definite concern to the trustees and me, too,” he said.

When asked if any plans are underway for an intensified fund-raising program, he mentioned the $3 million that was raised last year and said that finances will be discussed at the meeting of the Board of Trustees late this month. Spencer added, “The basic thing to fund raising is making the college worth raising funds for. In a way, everything I do is fund-raising.”

MacCormac sees an intensified fund-raising program as one of the few directions the college can go to ease its financial problems and to increase faculty and staff salaries. Spencer said that the trustees are likely to...approve an increase in student tuition for next year, but MacCormac believes that if Davidson continues to raise tuition, it will price itself out of the market. According to “Forbes,” small colleges across the nation have a similar problem. “What everybody worries about is pricing yourself out of a particular market. We’re not terribly worried about the bottom of the market, and we’re certainly not priced out at the top. The real problem is the people in between,” said Bowdoin’s Howell.

The college stock portfolio will not provide the financial help Davidson is going to need, according to MacCormac. “We’ve dropped a tremendous amount in the stock market over the past year,” he commented. The problem of faculty compensation is a complex one by itself even if some balance is found for straight faculty salaries. One of the major ways the trustees analyze faculty compensation is by comparing Davidson compensation with that of other private colleges. Davidson is generally compared scholastically to schools like Amherst, Haverford, Swarthmore, etc. MacCormac asserts that Davidson faculty compensations are inferior to many of these schools. Spencer disagreed with MacCormac, indicating that Davidson is about equal or better in this area when compared to these schools. Figures comparing schools are inconclusive because each survey tends to rate colleges by different criteria and draws conflicting conclusions. Also, the finances required for a professor to live in one part of the country may vary a great deal from the amount of money that person needs to live in another region.

The accompanying chart shows several private colleges that are usually considered Davidson’s scholastic peers. The average faculty compensation figures are taken from the recent study done by the AAUP. It should be noted that Wesleyan, Bowdoin, Oberlin, Occidental, and Reed offer a restricted range of graduate programs whereas all others listed offer only a bachelor’s degree. The important questions remain: Are faculty salaries sufficient to endure rising costs and competition with higher wages in other areas of the population? Can Davidson afford to hire high-quality professors, thereby helping maintain its past academic standing?

**Non-Credit Courses**

By ANDREW LAMAS

The Co-Curricular Program provides interested students, faculty, and community members with the opportunity of pursuing non-curriculum courses outside of the regular college on a non-graded, non-credit basis. Complementing Davidson’s regular curriculum, the Co-Curriculum Program adds flexibility and diversity to the college’s educational environment. Also, such a program allows its participants to pursue their interests in both practical and academic areas without the usual academic pressure and competition.

Instructors have been secured, thus far, for three courses. Earl W. Lawrimore has volunteered to instruct students in photography. Rory Crawford will teach guitar lessons. Ginny Newell has offered to assist in the instruction of pottery-making.

The procedure for starting or participating in a course is uncomplicated. A student or faculty member simply expresses to the Co-Curriculum Board his or her interests. Board members may be contacted between regular class periods in the Chambers Building lobby. The Board will publicize campus-wide all suggested courses, in order to attract other persons with similar interests.

Courses such as auto mechanics, typing, guitar lessons, instruction in cooking, and yoga have attracted the most interest among students. Other courses which have been suggested are: American Civil Liberties, American post-war science fiction, Bob Dylan 101, Pre-calculus preparatory course, refresher chemistry, the Christian charismatic renewal movement in America, current political awareness, study of dreams and sleep learning, harmonica lessons, horseback riding, numismatics, photography, pottery, reading improvement, sports administration, and stocks and bonds.

Courses which involve the learning of skills (e.g., carpentry) would require the presence of a trained instructor. Other courses, those in the academic category, will probably function as discussion groups with students, faculty, and community members rotating as discussion leaders.
