**Baseball and Banana Splits** raises more than $350 for African banana farmers

**Service event’s proceeds will provide small loans to Kenya’s banana farmers**

Turner House combined ice cream, Davidson sports, and service with its “Baseball and Banana Splits” fundraiser on Saturday, March 16. The project took place on Turner’s back porch, where the women of Turner House traded banana splits for donations during the baseball team’s doubleheader against Georgia Southern.

Proceeds totaled $359.04 and will go to benefit an innovative, award-winning agricultural development project that is helping African farmers grow more bananas. Dr. David Alvarez, visiting assistant professor of English, came to Turner with this need last semester, and Turner decided to sponsor “Baseball and Banana Splits.”

Alvarez explained that the project is meant to aid rural banana farmers in eastern Africa. “Diseases and pests have devastated their crops, partly because farmers lack clean, disease-free planting materials.

“But thanks to a consortium of public agricultural research centers and private industry, tissue-culture bananas are now available to African farmers. With yields improved by at least 30% and a faster growth rate, these tissue-culture bananas are making a real difference to farmers’ lives, especially for women, who are primarily responsible for growing bananas in African culture.

“To access these improved materials, however, farmers need access to credit. A tissue-culture banana plant costs just $1.40, but this is beyond the reach of the region’s subsistence farmers. Accordingly, the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA), a non-profit organization that seeks to reduce poverty by providing farmers in developing countries with access to new agricultural technologies, has set up a micro-credit program based on the Grameen Group Approach, which has been a huge success in other parts of the world.

“The program establishes a revolving fund for small loans to farmers—rather like a credit union—and as farmers repay these loans the money is then lent out again,” he said.

The proceeds from this fundraiser will be contributed to the credit program’s revolving fund.

Sutton explained that it is important for Davidson students to get a better understanding of international conflicts.

Sutton added that students should realize that although we at Davidson may not suffer directly from conflict, it is important to search for ways to defuse these conflicts around the world. He expressed the hope that this film series would aid in the accomplishment of these goals.

The films, most of which are being shown in Perkins Auditorium in Chambers, are followed up by discussions led by various faculty members. Sutton noted that Professor Zoran Kuzmanovich led a particularly engaging discussion after the film *Prelude to Kosovo* by drawing on some of his own experiences in the former Yugoslavia.

Sutton explained that attendance was low at the first film, *Forbidden Marriages in the Holy Land*, which was unfortunate because Aviva Raz-Shechter, a counselor from the Israeli Embassy, was present for the discussion. Later that evening, Raz-Shechter delivered an address entitled “Israel and the Arab World” in the Smith 900 Room of the Union.

Attendance increased for *Prelude to Kosovo*, but fell sharply to one audience member on March 14 due to Davidson’s NCAA tournament game, which took place at the same time.

The film that was supposed to be shown at that time, *Just a Little Red Dot*, was instead screened on Saturday, March 16 after Multicultural Kids’ Day in the Union.

Sutton encouraged all faculty, staff, and students to take advantage of these films while they are on campus. Other films being shown in the series include *Rain 1949*, *Long Night’s Journey into Day*, and *Regret to Inform: A Journey in Search of Time*. The last film, *Peace of Mind: Coexistence through the Eyes of Palestinian and Israeli Teens*, will be shown on Thursday, March 21 in Perkins Auditorium at 4 p.m.

The film centers on the efforts of Palestinian and Israeli teenagers who met at a “Seeds of Peace” camp in Maine. It chronicles their return home and their efforts to visit each other in their homes, amidst bombings and volatile peace talks that threaten their security. Professor Shaw Smith will lead the discussion afterwards.
