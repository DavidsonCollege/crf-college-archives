THE BACK PAGE INTERVIEW

Author Margaret Atwood Answers All

By Mark Damon Puckett

Sharp-featured and sharp-witted Margaret Atwood patiently entertained nearly two hours of queries from students Monday afternoon (2/18) in the 900
Room. The following questions and answers are excerpted from that period. The same evening she spoke and read and answered
questions that ranged from her Canadian background to “How does it feel to be so damn famous?” Atwood has written
Surfacing, The Handmaid’s Tale, and Cat’s Eye to name but a few of her works.

Audience: I think of is that I read The Handmaid’s Tale in a Women Writer’s class, and I was one
of three guys in a class of thirty females. Also, the audience here today is, say, 70% female. You have
to have that in mind when you write--

Atwood: No, actually, I don’t have it in mind when I write. I read books by men. I think it’s
a little bit harder for men to read books by women just as it’s harder for men to wear skirts.
Men don’t want to be seen in public wearing skirts, but that doesn’t stop them from doing it in secret.
I know I have quite a wide male readership because I get letters from these guys, and also they incorporate
things that actually happened to them in their own lives, but they can also incorporate stories about their relatives. For
example, your parents saying, “You’re like your Uncle Tom,” or “You’re the spitting image of your grandmother.” All of these
mythologies are given to us and we are always rearranging those and choosing. We are choosing what relatives we want
to be like. I think everybody does this, not just writers.

Audience (female): Is there anything about you expressed in your characters?

Audience (female): How.

Atwood: In a way it could you allow your book, The Handmaid’s Tale, to be made into a movie after
having a bad experience earlier with movies?

Atwood: I live in hope. I like movies. I like watching movies. I’ll watch anything really. I’m probably the only
person you have ever met who has seen a film called The Creeping Eye, a B-movie of the Fifties. I
write for the reader, and the reader can be an old person, the reader can be a very young person,
the reader can be male or female, the reader can be homosexual or heterosexual, the reader can be any color,
the reader can be from any country. That is the reader. It doesn’t matter. It’s very nice of you to
be interested in me, but I don’t think it’s the most important thing about a book. The book is the
most important thing about the book.

I have thought about making movies, which I know I will never actually do because it takes too much time
and I would rather write. Also, the man who was interested in it--the producer--was passionately interested in making it. He
devoted a lot of time to it, then he found it a very hard film to actually make because of
the subject matter. You have to admire thecourage of somebody like that. *The Handmaid's Tale* was not an easy book
to get off the ground. Hollywood was scared to death of it because of the subject matter. So I have
a secret yen to turn up at book signings where they used to always say, “Sign this for my wife.”
Now, a lot has changed and these same men are starting to say, “Sign this for me. My name is
Bob.”

**Audience (female):** Do you consider yourself a realist?

**Atwood:** No. Realism is a word that describes a certain kind of writing. If you’re asking me whether I think
I’m a realist in my life—obviously we all think we’re realists. But realism in writing was a certain kind of
writing that tended to exclude other things. I would not place myself in that tradition since I include lots of
things in my writing that would not come under the heading of realism, including dreams, premonitions, altered states of time.

**Audience (female):** Do you write for a particular audience?

**Atwood:** No, I write for the reader, and the reader can be anybody. The reader can be an old person,
the reader can be a very young person, the reader can be male or female, the reader can be homosexual
or heterosexual, the reader can be any color, the reader can be from any country. That is the reader.

**Audience (male):** When you say you don’t write for a particular audience, all I can think of is...

**Audience (female):** How much of your own experience do you include in your works?

**Atwood:** Experience, yes. If your family tells you a story about something that happened before you were born, you incorporate
that into your own history. I think almost everybody does that. Everybody is constantly constructing a novelistic history of their
lives, and into that history of granted, the book is never separate from the author, but, of course, when an
experience has gone through my head in some shape or other (since I wrote it down in the first place)
I had to have thought of it in some form, but it doesn’t mean it happened to me personally.

**Audience (male):** What projects are you working on now?

**Atwood:** I just finished editing a book of stories that will come out in the fall called *Wilderness Tips*—if you
want to read the title story it’s in the current *New Yorker*, the one with two cats on it. I
finished the screenplay to *Cat’s Eye*. I have four lectures to write for Oxford University in England—that will happen at
the end of April. And I have started a novel. Do you think that will keep me busy?

**Audience (male):** How do you keep yourself from jumping ahead when you're working on a novel?

**Atwood:** If I need to write a scene that needs to be written today, then I will write it and
figure out later how it fits in. It may not fit in at all. If something really presents itself to
me with a lot of clamor, I will not make the mistake of not writing it right then.
