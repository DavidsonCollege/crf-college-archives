MONDAY, OCTOBER 3, 1994

Students looking with a keen eye in the library the first couple of weeks during the semester may have noticed
that a new type of directory was on display. The directory included every student's social security number, which alarmed some
students.

The information was on display for anyone who walked into the library. RLO Director Richard Terry says, “The directories were
given to administrative staff people who might need the social security numbers.”

Terry expressed his regret that the directory was out in the open and quickly had the directory removed from the
library. Assistant Dean of Students Leslie Marsicano said she thought that it had “been clear about how to use these
directories when they have been given out.”

Why the change?

Davidson College switched the student ID numbers from random numbers to social security numbers this past summer to accommodate the
new computer program, Banner. Controller Ed Kania says the switch “puts us in alignment with the rest of the world
in terms of transmitting information back and forth.”

The new ID number gives Davidson easier access to admissions records, allows the school to be more effective in distributing
financial aid packages, and facilitates access to information on payment plans. Kania explains that getting this information before the change
occurred was “a cumbersome and manual process.”

Concerns about the switch

Senior Thad Reece praises the positive aspects of the system; however, he complains that “the social security numbers are written
like social security numbers on the card.”

Marsicano says “the change had to be made quickly to not delay registration for the students, which meant the college
did not have time to redesign the ID cards.”

Concerns about privacy rights have risen through this issue. The Family Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 states that social
security numbers cannot be released with normal information about people, such as names and addresses. Some students are uncomfortable knowing
that their social security number is on their ID card. Others, like senior Sean Callahan, say, “It does not bother
me. It is easier to remember.”

Marsicano says the college will soon be able to change the face of the ID cards so that the numbers
are not displayed in the normal social security format. Once able, the college will replace current cards with the new
cards upon request.

SGA Honor Code review committee meets

By Meg Wolff
Amidst recent student and faculty enthusiasm, the SGA ad hoc committee to review the honor system met Thursday. With representatives
from the SGA, the Honor Council, and from the student body, the committee discussed strategies for generating school-wide discussion about
the Honor Code.

Committee chair Warren Buford, along with Honor Council Chair Arthur Gaston, emphasized the purpose of the committee: “We are not
out to create a problem with the Honor Code; our purpose is instead to generate discussion on its effectiveness, its
merits as well as its shortcomings as perceived by the college community.”

With an initial goal of “information gathering,” the committee hopes to hold informal discussions on the honor code within social
organizations, possibly organizing a school-wide panel discussion. Students are encouraged to speak to members of the committee.

SGA Honor Code Review Committee members:
Warren Buford, Damien Dillinger, Ann Hatfield, Arthur Gaston, Meg Wolff, Lindsay O’Nell, Anna Gray Anderson, Saad Gul, John Philpott, Jo
Burrows, Kevin O’Nell, Phil Ewing, Lillian Montgomery

By Beth Lindsey

Three new seniors were elected to the Honor Council last week. The elections began Monday with nineteen candidates running for
the positions. On Tuesday there was a run-off in which those running were narrowed down to eight.

Arthur Gaston, Chair of the Honor Council, congratulates the three people elected as new members: Elizabeth Fleming, Betsy Jones, and
Mark Reilly.

Gaston says, “The elections went very smoothly and I’m very happy about the results.”
