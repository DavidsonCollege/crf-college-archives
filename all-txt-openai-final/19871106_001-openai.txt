There was considerable excitement Monday night when a boiler system safety valve released billowing columns of steam from a Belk
Dorm mechanical room.

Volunteer fire departments from Davidson, Cornelius, and Huntersville responded to the alarm turned in by students who heard an explosion
and found steam engulfing the northeast corner of the building.

As hundreds of students watched, firemen found a cutoff valve for the steam line in an outdoor manhole and shut
off the steam at around 11:30. Cashion said the only damage was a little sogginess in rooms above the leak
where occupants had left their windows open.

**Students win ’88-’89 calendar changes**

**Davidson to have seven exam days**

By FRANK FOLGER and WALT REYNOLDS

The Student Government Association won a significant victory last week when the Executive Committee of the Faculty approved the addition
of an extra exam day for each exam period in the 1988-89 school calendar.

The 1988-89 curriculum calendar now includes seven exam days for each period instead of the previously determined six days. The
changes for the fall and spring examinations are the following:

- The final day of the fall examination period will be on Thursday, December 22nd, rather than Wednesday, December 21st;
- The spring semester will begin on Tuesday, January 10th, one day earlier than previously scheduled;
- The spring examination period dates will be from Wednesday, May 3rd to Wednesday, May 10th, with Tuesday, May 2nd
switching from a class day to a reading day.

On October 28th, a committee made up of SGA President Conrad Doenges and SGA representatives Doug Hicks, Harrison Murray, and
Caroline Buxton presented to the Executive Committee a proposal for the addition of extra reading days to next year’s exam
schedules.

Before the presentation, SGA Patterson Court representatives were asked to speak to their respective houses regarding the scheduled reading day
situation. From October 22 to October 27, the SGA surveyed the student body.

**New dorms’ site chosen; Belk parking lot safe**

By TOBY TRUOG

Three new student dormitories will be constructed on a site just to the southwest of the Covington golf facility, the
Davidson College administration decided this week. The three-story buildings will house a total of 144 students and will cost an
estimated $2.75 million to construct.

The site near the golf course was chosen over two other proposed sites, one on the northwestern corner of Patterson
Court and the other in the area currently occupied by the Belk dormitory parking lot. Students had expressed some concern
over the parking lot site proposal, which was rejected because a consultant to the college recommended that the site would
be better suited to other future use.

Other factors in the choice of the site included proximity to the student activity areas, distance from the academic buildings,
and student opinion.

“The student opinion, as it was expressed to me, was that the dorms should be a little far away, but
not completely out of the picture,” said Dean of Students Will Terry.

Director of Facilities Planning Grover Meetze said that construction plans are unclear at this time. “We had planned to have
them ready for occupation next September,” he said, “but the changes we’ve made in the design and delay in picking
a site will make that more difficult.”

Currently, the only obstacles standing in the way of construction are changes in design. The original plan that called for
four two-story dormitories has been modified to call for three three-story dorms. Meetze said that the changes will make better
use of the available land and will facilitate construction.

“We hope that the design changes can be made quickly enough so that they [the dorms] can be completed by
September 1989,” said Meetze.

Floor plans for the residence halls have not changed. Tom Jennings, Director of Residence Life, said that each floor will
be divided into four suites, each of which will house four students. Each suite will have single bedrooms and a
common living room, kitchen, and bathroom. “The plan compliments our efforts to facilitate more student interaction in small communities,” he
said.

The dirt road that currently runs from Patterson Court to Ridge Road will be rerouted closer to the tennis courts.
Meetze said that the culvert for the creek running through Patterson Court will probably be extended toward the east so
that parking spaces for the residence halls can be built.

Taking into consideration these additional costs, as well as others related to the distance of the new dorms from utilities
and the topography of the area, Meetze estimated that the project will cost roughly $2.75 million.

The new site does not lend itself to another addition in the immediate area because of its variable topography. However,
Meetze does not rule out the possibility of construction in the Belk parking lot or other areas.

What lies in the future for Davidson College housing and for the size of Davidson College? Looking beyond meeting the
immediate need to have on-campus housing for all students, is the college preparing for an increase in enrollment?

According to Dean Terry, a plan for gradual growth has been discussed. “We are considering an addition of about ten
more students per year. This is flexibility that we want to maintain.”
