Sidelines With
JIM

The trustees are to be commended for their decision
last Friday. In desubsidizing football at Davidson, the
trustees finally put an end to the slow strangulation of
a program which was doomed to failure.

The trustees’ decision was prompted by a look at
financial reality, and the subsequent admission that it
was asking too much of Dave Fagg, his staff, and the
players to win a Southern Conference championship
while operating on a shoestring budget.

Most of the student body reacted favorably to the
decision, but I have mixed feelings towards the
move for several reasons.

On the positive side, I was pleased with the realign-
ment of the Wildcat Club’s policy. Under the new
policy set up by the trustees, the Wildcat Club will
distribute its funds among all teams unless the con-
tributor specifically earmarks his funds for a par-
ticular sport.

This move will greatly benefit the so-called
“minor” sports at Davidson. The players and coaches
of these teams, (specifically soccer, baseball, and
tennis) have been deserving of these funds for several
years. Hopefully, the long overdue recognition of
these sports and of their contribution to Davidson
athletics will continue.

One of the reasons for my discontent is the manner
in which the trustees went about announcing their
decision. It seems unfair that the issue was voted on
and the news announced while the team was in
Colorado. This move, whether deliberate or not, gives
the trustees and the administration a bad image in the
eyes of those outside the college.

The greatest source of my discontentment with the
trustees’ decision, however, is the fact that they did
not go far enough with their action.

It has already been proven that the football team
cannot be considered a legitimate contender in the
Southern Conference because the school cannot afford
to give the team anywhere near the amount of money
that its opponents receive.

Why, then, did the trustees set up a program
which has Davidson competing against these schools
when the team receives no money at all?

In deciding to desubsidize football and drop the
three “powers” in the conference, the trustees did
not go far enough. They should have dropped out of
the Southern Conference altogether.

In dropping E. C. U., William and Mary, and Rich-
mond the trustees made a step in the right direction.

Club Gridders Beaten By Tough VCU Squad
By BILL LLOYD
Staff Writer

The Davidson College club
football team traveled to
Virginia Commonwealth
University at Richmond Satur-
day. As has been the case many
times in the past the Cats suf-
fered a substantial defeat, 29-0.

Immediately following the
game, one VCU player was
heard to comment, “That was
the most physical game that I have
ever played in either high
school or college.” This sentiment was, for
the most part, shared by both
teams.

VCU scored their touchdowns
on two long runs from scrim-
mage, an interception return,
and a long pass off a flea-
flicker.

The Wildcat defense,
however, performed valiantly
with such standouts as Bob Wet-
zel, Tony Boon, Eric Scharling,
and George “Tiny” King.

The Wildcat offense was vir-
tually nonexistent with the ex-
ception of the typically brilliant
play of junior quarterback Jim-
my Boyd.

Boyd’s bootleg runs and deep
over-the-middle passes to
junior split end Lester Ab-
berger were the only effective
offensive threats.

“Many of the guys on the of-
fensive line had never played
there before,” Boyd com-
mented. “Because of this we
couldn’t get a decent running or
passing game going.”

The Cats depended on the
punting of senior Bill Dupont,
who averaged better than 35
yards per kick under an
unusually aggressive rush by
the VCU front four, to con-
tinually get the team out of
trouble.

Davidson has played seven
games so far this season. Every
team that they have played has
at least one coach and at least
two organized practices per
week. This is in direct contrast to
Davidson club football
philosophy.

“Club football is totally for
fun and there shouldn’t be any
work or obligation involved,”
explained co-organizer Rollie
White. “We never know who is
going to show up, but somehow
we always wind up with at least
eleven guys.”

With the changes in football
on a varsity level, club football
at Davidson might possibly
become a more substantial
program than it is at the
present time.

The club gridders take on
UNC-Chapel Hill at Chapel Hill
this Sunday. They finish up the
season against UNC-Charlotte
the following week.
