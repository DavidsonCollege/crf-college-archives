The Producers
Next Friday in the 900 Room, Tickets available 2-5 at the Union box office.

MOST SQUIRRELS think they are the intellectual equals of humans. They are wrong. But because of their large brains, their
interesting political views, and their refusal to believe it, they continue to feed on the bland, unpalatable acorn. Most would
never touch a steak dinner.

MOST SQUIRRELS are CARNIVORES! But because of their large brains, they are too stupid to realize it. A recent poll
of Davidson squirrels showed 51% Republican, 49% Democrat, and 1% Indifferent Libertarian.

So now you think you know our friend, the squirrel... but because of their large brains, they are too stupid
to realize it. So, for engaging one in a conversation, if he still fails to respond and runs away, it
means he doesn’t like you.
