4 The DAVIDSONIAN, March 1, 1916

FOUR MORE LECTURES IN SERIES GIVEN BY FACULTY

On March 11, Dr. George De Roulac Hamilton, of the University of North Carolina, will give to the students the
next lecture in the series begun by Dr. Sledd. He is making a trip among the colleges of North Carolina
and neighboring states in the interest of the International Conciliation Movement, and will speak on some subject connected with this
movement.

About the middle of March, Prof. W. M. Thorn, formerly of Davidson, now of the University of Virginia, will lecture.
This will probably be a stereopticon lecture on the Panama Canal, which he visited a few years ago.

In the latter part of March or the first of April there will be a lecture given by a Washington
man connected with the Department of Forest Reserve. The lecture will probably be on Forestry and especially on the Appalachian
Forest Reserve in this state.

During April, Mr. O. O. Atto, official in charge of the Weather Bureau at Charlotte, will give a lecture on
the various work in that line. He will use a very interesting collection of lantern slides. This lecture will close
the series for the year.

DR. McCONNELL SPEAKS AT Y. M.C. A. MEETING

The Y. M. C. A. proposes to have several lectures on interesting subjects at their regular Thursday night meetings during
the spring term. Last Thursday night Dr. J. W. McConnell held the audience with an interesting discourse on hygiene and
its application to the college man of today. Practically the entire student body was present and derived much benefit from
the lecture. Dr. McConnell put the proposition up to the students as a matter of duty. Nature brings one into
the world in a normal, healthy condition and he should do everything possible to aid nature and keep his body
in as good condition as possible, as it is in truth the temple of the Holy Spirit.

GOLF TOURNAMENT THIS SPRING

The annual golf tournament will begin this year on March 20. Following the plan of last year the elimination will
be by means of the handicap. Beginning with the last week of February, each contestant will be required to play
at least ten nine-hole rounds. The score in these preliminaries must be handed to the secretary of the club, J.
H. Carson, and will be used in determining the winner in the handicap. After the handicap a foursome will be
played. McNamara, the well-known golf professional, will probably play a round or two on the local course before the close
of the season. This will be an exhibition game and will no doubt be witnessed by many golf enthusiasts.

of them all, but mention can be made of the solos given by J. L. Fowle and F. H. Baker
