Davidson Charity Group Presents Financial Report to the new Davidson Club

One of the main subjects was that of the North Carolina Association of Jewish Women, which donated twenty-seven current volumes to the Davidson Club. These books, with influence in the world, include:

Francis Hackett’s "What Mein Kampf Means to America" promises to be one of the most attractive of those books. The author, who has written a number of international best-sellers, discusses Hitler's "Mein Kampf."

Davidson possibly boasts of having the prettiest coed group of any student body with these four girls being the only four of the lovely minority represented on the campus. They are Isabelle Linker, Carolyn Lassiter, Lucy Morrison, and Betty Kerr. All are sophomores except Miss Morrison who entered Davidson as a freshman this fall. (Photo by Billy Barker)
