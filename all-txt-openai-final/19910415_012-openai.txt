Service, and my unlocked door

And you're telling me, "Don't come 'round here no more"?

I had a doubt about it, but I'm gonna get it straight
Climbing my backpack where I left it once,
To put in a good word, see it through,
My thanks go out to all Buckhead Dead crew.

The Real World, just wait for me

So this is all you'll be seeing of the real M.C.
Please most of you will never be finding out who I really am.

With Spring so definitely sprung, more and more Davidson students are enjoying the outdoors.

Here are a few of those students, thanks to the Davidsonian's Candid Exposure Photo Staff.

of Spades at last week's Lazy Saturday party outside of KA.
