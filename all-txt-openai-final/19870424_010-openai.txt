### The Davidsonian
**Friday, April 24, 1987**

The Davidson baseball team rebounded from two tough losses to Western Carolina to soundly defeat Pfeiffer this week during their final stages of preparation for the Southern Conference tournament this weekend.

The miserable weather late last week must have been an omen that the Catamounts of Western Carolina were going to rain on the Wildcats’ parade last weekend. Davidson was riding a five-game winning streak and had their sights set on being the Southern Division’s number one seed at the upcoming tournament. The Wildcats needed to beat Western Carolina two out of two or three out of three games (depending on the weather) to unseat the Catamounts from their first-place position.

Western Carolina got out of the blocks early by scoring eight runs in the top of the second inning. They also added four in the third, and one each in the fifth and sixth frames. Davidson found themselves in a hole, but soon their bats were heard from. Senior catcher Dan Simonds put the Cats on the scoreboard in the fourth inning by clubbing a three-run homer. Mark Thompson added a solo shot later in the inning. In the fifth inning, Brian Moure and Simonds hit back-to-back home runs: Moure’s was a two-run wallop to right field; Simonds’ was a solo drive to left field. After six complete innings, Western Carolina led 14-7. Davidson mounted a comeback in the bottom of the seventh inning when Dave DePaul hit his eleventh round-tripper of the year which came with two men on base. But the Catamount lead was insurmountable, and Western Carolina won the first game of the doubleheader 14-10.

Western Carolina jumped out to the early lead in game two later that afternoon on a two-run homer in the top of the first inning. But Davidson’s Alan Lewis belted his eleventh dinger of the year to cut the Catamount lead to 2-1. The Catamounts added another single run in the third inning, but the big blow came in the fifth inning on a grand slam which put Western Carolina up by the score of 7-1. Davidson could only muster one more run when Thompson walked with the bases loaded scoring Lewis. Western Carolina added one more run in the seventh and won 8-2.

Earlier this week the weather took a turn for the better, and so did Davidson’s good fortune. The Cats took out their frustrations on the visiting Pfeiffer Falcons as they pounded thirteen hits, resulting in a 10-5 win. Davidson’s big inning came in the third when they sent fourteen batters to the plate and scored eight runs. Simonds rapped a triple up the left-center alley plating three runners to blow the game wide open. Besides Simonds, Dave Turgeon, Dave DePaul, George Halter, and Bill Masse all had RBIs in the inning. Moure took the Pfeiffer pitcher downtown in the sixth frame, and Simonds’ double in the eighth inning scoring Turgeon for Davidson’s other scores. Pitchers Jeff Loser, Greg Wilcox, and Charlie Winborne combined for Davidson win with Wilcox getting credit for the victory.

Hopefully, Wednesday’s drubbing of Pfeiffer got the Cats back on track as they head into the Southern Conference Tourney this weekend. At 3 pm today they play Appalachian State (22-6 overall, 10-2 in SC), the number one seed from the northern division. The double-elimination tournament, which also includes Western Carolina and VMI, is scheduled to end on Sunday. The winner gets an automatic berth in the NCAA tournament to be held later this spring. There is also a chance that a second Southern Conference team might receive an at-large bid to participate as well. Last year, conference champion Western Carolina as well as Appalachian State made it to post-season play.

**For the Record Book:**
Bill Masse is leading the Southern Conference in hitting at a .419 clip... Davidson boasts the top four home run hitters in the conference: Turgeon and Masse have 12 each, while Lewis and DePaul have 11 apiece... The 1987 team has set an all-time record for home runs in a season. They currently have 69 round-trippers on the year.

**Sports here at Davidson and around the world**
By ANDY BARRON

With so much going on in the world of sports, both at and away from Davidson, confining myself to one topic seemed an unnecessary torture. As I despise even mental cruelty, I have granted myself a reprieve and will wander seemingly without purpose across the wide world of sports.

If you’re a hockey fan I hope you saw The Game over the Easter weekend. Last Saturday night the New York Islanders outlasted the Washington Capitals 4-3 in game seven of their best-of-seven playoff series in a game that took more than three periods of...Sudden death play to determine a winner. The game offered a clinic in superior goal-tending and showed some great athletes giving everything they had for the team. And that’s what sports is all about, isn’t it? As the two teams lined up to shake hands, I’m not sure who was happier, the Islanders for winning, or the Capitals for having all the time they needed to recover.

While major league baseball stood in collective awe at the 13-game winning streak strung together by the Milwaukee Brewers, the Davidson baseball team finished second in their division to qualify for this weekend’s conference championships. Unfortunately for Davidson, this year will be the last for Coach George Greer, who announced this week he will coach at Wake Forest starting next season. Greer has taken a program that had nothing five years ago and made it into a perennial conference contender that currently sports half a dozen potential major league draft picks come end of the season. I wish Coach Greer the best of luck in the future.

Speaking of coaches leaving, I guess someone needs to address the strange topic of basketball coach Bobby Hussey’s possible departure. When Matt “The Voice of Davidson Baseball” Newsom announced at a baseball game that Hussey had withdrawn his name from consideration for the Toledo coaching job, the proclamation met with claps from two alumni, but curiosity from the student fans: none of the students seemed to be able to decide if this was good or bad news. If you’re reading, Coach Hussey, I think a bit of public relations are in order. Get out there and high-five those crazy students who consistently succeed in imitating a Nuremberg rally for every Johnston Gym extravaganza.

I guess since we are in “Metrolina” I should mention the NBA granting Charlotte a franchise. I know a lot of people in Charlotte are happy and I don’t want to rain on their parade, but the NBA is boring until the playoffs and Charlotte won’t be in the playoffs for a long, long time. Just ask the Pacers, Clippers, or Warriors how tough it is to make the playoffs.

For all you golfers inspired by Larry Mize’s incredible chip to win the Masters, I have an important announcement. In honor of his fiftieth class reunion this weekend, golf-course czar Howard Covington will award $100 to anyone who hits a hole-in-one at Covington National this weekend. Of course, you have to be a member of his graduating class to qualify, but money or not, you can bet I'll be out there hacking away all weekend. No Auburn students allowed.

On the IMAC front, the story of the spring so far has to be the confrontation between junior pitcher Andrea Dietrich and junior basketball star Dean Keener. Dietrich struck out Keener not once, but twice. Keener came back strong, however, by popping up to the centerfielder his next time up to bat. When the fielder dropped the easy out, Keener burned around the basepaths at such a blinding pace he lapped a teammate forced to tag up at the potential fly out. Keener goes down as one of the few people to ever fly out into a double play.

Finally, for those of you who don’t know, I’m pleased to announce the First Annual Malcolm Partin Tanning Contest. Dr. Partin, in an attempt to get students “beyond the pale” for future beach trips, has decided to sponsor this contest as inspiration to lose that winter white. For more details, contact Dr. Partin in his office.

Men’s Tennis. The Cats had a relatively quiet week as they concentrated on practicing for this weekend’s conference tournament at V.M.I. The only action they saw was a singles-only tilt against U.S.C. on Tuesday, in which the strong Gamecocks swept all six matches. The difficult competition should help the Cats in their quest for the conference championship.

Basketball. Seniors Ace Tanner and Chris Heineman have been participating all this month in an Atlantic Coast Conference barnstorming tour. The players have been holding their own with some of the top performers in the country, including such notables as Kenny Smith and Horace Grant.

Wildcat Athlete of the Week. This week's Bryant-Wilks athlete of the week is junior tennis player Amy McNelis. This past weekend, Amy made it all the way to the Southern Conference Championship before bowing out. Congratulations Amy on an impressive performance and good luck for continued success this summer.

In search of... If anyone could tell me why there is that sign on the third hole of Covington National which reads “Home of the Wildcats,” I would truly appreciate it. It seems to me that the sign would be better used if it was turned around to face the baseball field.
