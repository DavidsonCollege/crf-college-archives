**Honors College Members Evaluate Program Some Express Desire For Changes**

By JOE SMITH
Associate Editor

A random sampling of the students presently enrolled in the Honors College indicates that they are, for the most part, satisfied with that program. It also reveals, however, a desire for further change in the program among a number of the students.

Tom Opie, a senior whose areas of concentration are organic chemistry and environmental problems, said that his experience in the Honors College had done more to give direction to his studies than anything else in his career at Davidson. Gene Early, whose principal interest is in educational psychology, said that the program is rewarding in that it removes the fragmentation of time and interest created by the course set-up of the regular college.

Early pointed out that these fragmentations undermined the educational value of regular courses. All of the Honors College students agreed that the removal of graduation requirements enabled them to pursue interests which would have been inaccessible under the regular system.

Greg Scott, who is specializing in labor relations and local government, said that this arrangement was very rewarding from the point of view of a senior. He noted that, at this point in his career, he was ready for practical experience and independent work, rather than further classes.

The students’ enthusiasm is tempered by a concern that the Honors College move further away from the traditional educational format. John McLean, a junior who will leave the Honors College at the end of this term, stated that the program involved an evaluation process which is more rigorous than that of the regular college. He said that freedom from traditional evaluation had been a major reason for his application to the program in the first place.

The position was also taken by a number of the students that the Honors College was not fostering the kind of work that the regular curriculum blocks. Danny Clodfelter, a junior specializing in philosophy, pointed out that the selection process almost precluded the development of outstanding skills, since the people chosen to participate had already, in one way or another, shown that the skills in question were already developed.

Students Rich Cowart and Steve Salyer maintained that the Honors College was not fulfilling its promise to the full in that much of the work being done at present could be done under the regular curriculum. Salyer pointed out that the independent study tracts of the regular curriculum give all students the opportunity to do the same kind of work that Honors College students do.

**Hears Report For Freshman Assignment**

By RICHARD WILSON
Asst. Managing Editor

Preliminary recommendations for Davidson's new social system have been submitted to the Committee of Eighteen by the financial and the procedure subcommittees. Although the committee expressed a general agreement with these proposals, they are not necessarily the final proposals of the committee.

The procedure subcommittee recommended: “That beginning the second term (or possibly over the Christmas holidays) each freshman be assigned to one of the 12 houses, to take benefit of the social life of the house and eat a

**Clodfelter On Nader Show**

Junior Danny Clodfelter spent last summer working for Ralph Nader's famous or infamous (depending on your viewpoint) Raiders on a controversial documentary of the North Carolina textile industry.

The documentary, the first of eight such studies researched by Nader-affiliated groups to be shown on television, was seen Wednesday night at 9:30. It focused on the town of Kannapolis, North Carolina, and on the Cannon Mills, a textile company which for all intents and purposes owns the town: the homes,Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

Strand) A NADER: RAIDER

Danny Clodfelter discusses his Kannapolis project, the stores, and the property. The main emphasis of the show was in determining the relationship between those people connected with Kannapolis and Mr. Charles Cannon, owner of the mills and hence the town. There were discrepancies on what individuals thought of Mr. Cannon personally, but the overall import of their dialogues seemed to be that these people's lives were being dictated to them by Mr. Cannon.

Working with Clodfelter on this project were John Foster, Davidson, class of ’70, Miss Lilona Smith, a Chapel Hill law school student, Miss Kate Blackwell, a freelance writer, and Harrison Wilford, a 1962 Davidson graduate and the group's leader. Using Nader's idea that “corporations have a certain responsibility to the public,” the group set out to find specifically how the Cannon Mills company and the J. P. Stevens Corporation mill at Roanoke Rapids used their immense powers as the sole large-scale employers of their respective towns.

In discussing the companies’ failings, Clodfelter pointed to “their failure to recognize that the problems of noise in the machinery and of the occurrence of byssinosis” (See Story on Page 2).

Lunch and an evening meal once a week at that house. “That at the beginning of the spring term each freshman be reassigned to a different house by means of random selection, and that he be allowed to take part in the social life offered and eat two meals a week at his new house. That at the end of this year, each freshman who desires to do so, lists his four top preferences of houses with which he wishes to associate at the beginning of his sophomore year. Memberships to the houses will then be made with regard to space available; each house having approximately equal membership. He may remain at this house as long as he chooses to do so or may move at the end of any term on the basis of space available by re-submitting himself to the self-selecting process.”

The procedure subcommittee also recommended that the board for all upperclassmen be on the basis of individual arrangement with the social organization. The subcommittee said the social system would not be compulsory after the freshman year. The subcommittee also proposed that “any house expressing its desire to remain in operation under these new guidelines will be guaranteed a house through the academic year 1971-72. In 1971-72 every upperclassman self-selected into any group should have equal access to all privileges in the house, including membership in the national organization, if one should exist.”

The subcommittee on finances split their report into two parts, depending on whether fraternities accept or reject the trustee action. If they accept the action, the houses should continue to manage their social activities and food services according to the stipulations herein defined. Furthermore, the house would continue election of its financial agents. “The college will require that monthly financial reports be submitted to the business office in an attempt to stay clear of financial difficulties. Should there be a compulsory system of freshman assignment, houses should be reimbursed for meal and out-of-pocket expenses; freshmen should not have to duplicate meal payment; freshmen should not have to pay a housing fee. After debts have been paid, the fraternity may dispose of its furniture as it wishes. Because of the time element, we have no assurance that replacement furniture could be obtained prior to September 1971.”

If the fraternities choose to reject the trustee action, “the fraternity must cease occupancy of the present house at the end of the current academic year. The college would not assume any financial obligations.”

The “Boys in the Band” will be in Davidson next week in the Morrison Room, see Scott Davidson's impressions on Page 2. Wildcat Mike Mikolayunas is tops in the nation in receiving as A. W. Turner relates on Page 8.
