They came from miles around.
Fans of bluegrass and country and western

Bluegrass fans came to the annual World’s Championship Fiddlers’ Convention last Saturday in Union Grove, about 15 miles north of Statesville.
It was a day-long affair, with a little friendly competition that night.
Altogether, several thousand folks joined in.

Some came to pick and strum.
Some to munch on cotton candy.
Some to relax in the sun.
And some just to watch it all.
