**Artists Series review ~ “Do Lord” dramatizes lives of American slaves**

By JOHN EARLES

“Do Lord, Remember Me” was brought to Davidson by the Artists Series on February 13. The play centers upon the
recollections of four elderly Americans, each eager to share his or her story with the audience. In many ways, the
characters are like any elderly people. Their memories include hopes and fears in both good times and bad. In one
important way, however, the characters are quite unusual: they were all raised under the institution of slavery.

The action takes place in 1936 at the Old Folks Home for the Colored in Virginia. Written by Jim DeJongh,
the play is based on over 2,000 actual interviews of ex-slaves that took place in the 1930s. Because verbatim text
from these interviews is used, the play possesses a horrific realism in its depictions of lives enslaved. Slaves were treated
like animals: sold to the highest bidder, transported in cages, fed in troughs, and whipped into submission. Moreover, slaves were
often tortured far worse than any animal could be: women raped on the whim of the master, a little girl
killed on the spot after dropping her master’s grandbaby, and men, women, and children threatened with being sold away from
everyone they loved.

“Do Lord, Remember Me” is also a play that reveals peoples’ ability to make the best of any situation. With
snickers and guffaws, the characters and the audience share the lighter moments that come just from being alive. In addition,
the audience was amused with myths on the creation of the different races. In one story, God gathers all the
people of the world together. He colors some yellow, some white, and some red before noticing that some of his
followers are missing. After several hours, the people arrive and explain their tardiness on having been asleep. God’s anger is
magnified when the people rush his throne in an effort to be given a color. The story ends as God's
screams of “Get Back!” are heard as “Get Black!” and the black race is formed in an accident of creation.
Ironically, the humor of the story is joined by the sadness of a race taught to be ashamed of the
color of their skin.

“Do Lord, Remember Me” was an enjoyable and informative performance. We have all been taught the importance of learning from
our elders, and in this case, there was something to be learned by everyone.

**Central American Week ~ Student journal recalls soldiers, ghosts, and despair**

By MEREDITH GOODING

Meredith Gooding, ‘91, spent time in Nicaragua during the summer of 1989. The following is a journal entry.

As I walked across the border between Costa Rica and Nicaragua I listened with concentration to hear the songs of
the country. The first sound I heard was...the rustle of the plastic red and black FSLN flags hung from the
roof of the wooden shelter just inside the gate guarded by several listless soldiers standing in the dust. Through the
bus windows, there is the unbroken pattern of land and people on a single palette. The twin volcanoes of Lake
Nicaragua rise majestically in the distance, framed by verdant pastureland and small settlements that we pass through as we travel
deeper into the country. Children with no clothing and protruding bellies stand in the doorways of their homes constructed from
wood and metal scraps, their faces expressive yet impenetrably silent—the face of Nicaragua.

On to Managua, a city of bones. Bones and rotting carcasses of history unable to completely disintegrate in their parched
climate. Skeletons of buildings sustain life within their cracked foundations. The only colors are the walls, canvas of the people,
slashes of red, black, and blue graffiti that echo the elaborate brickwork of Somoza’s highways. Empty blocks, devoid of structures,
give the eye something to extract that can be labeled beautiful. For there is no beauty in Managua nor is
there ugliness. Only a desperate waiting and emptiness that cause the visitor to ask what ghosts of the past still
walk here.

I would characterize the people of this country as strong from the weights they carry. Physical, mental, or emotional, the
citizens walk heavily as if exhausted from a long journey. One of the great tests of the visitor is how
to react to those who know suffering, how to react to begging children, the old men who hold up signs,
“I have two children to feed,” “Can you help me buy a shoeshine box?”, “Some money for some milk.” How
do you reconcile these individuals with the world you know?

In my panorama, I have not captured the current political situation, economic facts, and social statistics in my mind for
these are malleable intangibles; therefore, they carry no life. Instead, there are the images that will move like shadows across
my mind when Nicaragua is a nebulous memory: Con Daniel Todo Será Mejor, children selling cigarettes at intersections, military drab,
potholes filled with gravel, Cuidamos estos buses, Viva María, no water on Monday and Thursday, Victoria beer, murals, No pasarán,
Milca, gaseosas, the crumbling old cathedral, oxcarts, eyes—yes, in Nicaragua Libre there is life, a panorama of change. What is
a country anyway? What is a people anyway?
