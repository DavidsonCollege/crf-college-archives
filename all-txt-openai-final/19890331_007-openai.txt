Important News About the Library for All Davidson Students

Many changes in the Library have happened or will happen during the remaining weeks of school. Highlights are listed below. You are responsible for knowing about the changes. Our goal is to make more of the materials available for you more of the time in an environment which is appropriate for study and research.

**Change #1: Amnesty Week - April 3-7â€”Monday 8 a.m.-Friday 12 p.m.**  
For this week only, any book which is overdue, regardless of how long it is overdue, may be returned without any fine being charged. This is the first time in 150 years this has been offered... and probably the last. Take advantage of it now.

**Change #2:** Books from the general collection will be charged out for 4 weeks rather than 2 weeks. (Starting March 27th)

**Change #3:** Overdue fines for regular books (as of April 8th) will be 25 cents per day, no maximum.

**Change #4:** Overdue fines for reserve books (as of April 8th) will be 25 cents per hour, no maximum.

**Change #5:** Service charge increased to $10.00 for any I.O.U. sent to the Comptroller for collection.

**Change #6:** Soft drink and snack machines have been installed in the Smoking Room, 2nd Floor, on a trial basis. Drinks and food must be purchased/consumed in that room, not brought into the Library. If they are taken out of the room, the machines will be, too! Violators will be reported. Smoking is still allowed in the Smoking Room, 24 Hour Room, and Group Study Rooms. No smoking is allowed in the Library anywhere, anytime.

**Change #7:** Students making noise in the Library may be asked to leave the building and may be reported. I will be meeting with the SGA and other groups on campus in the weeks ahead to work on this problem. And make no mistake, it is a problem. I hope that you will want to be part of the solution, not the problem. We do not want to have to resort to hiring security guards to monitor the building. A solution must be found. And we welcome and encourage your participation in finding it.

**LOST BOOKS:** Please keep an eye out for them on campus and bring them back to the Library. This includes books not checked out, reference books, and bound periodicals.

My office is on the main floor (NE corner near the elevator), there is a suggestion box on the reference desk, my phone extension is 1837, and the Library post office box is 123. Let me hear from you about these matters or any others which affect the Library and its usefulness to you.
