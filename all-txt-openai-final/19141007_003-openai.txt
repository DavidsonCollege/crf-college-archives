MR. JACKSON CALLED HOME BY DEATH OF SISTER.
Following a severe illness of three weeks from typhoid fever, Miss Helen Jackson, the youngest sister of Mr. I. L.
Jackson, died early Tuesday morning of last week, at her home near Gastonia, N.C. Miss Jackson was a member of
the Junior class of the Gastonia High School last year, and when death came she was looking forward with pleasure
to the occasion of her graduation next Spring and then to a pleasant and successful college career. Being only seventeen
years old, just on the verge of young womanhood, an apt student and one whom not only her classmates, but
all with whom she came in contact esteemed and admired, are facts which make her death a peculiarly sad one.
Mr. Jackson's many friends both in the student body and in the town sympathize deeply with him in his bereavement.

SENIOR COMPOSITION CLASS WELL PLEASED WITH WORK.
Everyone in the special class in advanced composition isDelighted with the course, and there are many not in the class
who are wishing that they were. The work of the class consists in a study of the style of the
best English and American authors, together with exercises in literary interpretation and criticism. In addition to this, each member of
the class is permitted to choose some special line of composition along which he wishes to develop, and independent work
outside the class is done on this in consultation with Professor Fulton. The class is limited to nine members, every
one of whom is interested in the course, and Professor Fulton is expecting some good work from them.

Three cases of scarlet fever have been reported to the health officer, and the families quarantined. The Davidson Graded School
has been thoroughly disinfected and every precaution taken by the health officers. There was no school Friday and Saturday on
account of the fumigation, but everything is all right now and school work is going on as usual.

SOPH BANQUET OFFICERS ELECTED

At a meeting of the Soph class last Wednesday evening, Mr. R. W. McKay was elected as toastmaster for the
annual Soph banquet. The success of any banquet always depends upon the efficiency of the toastmaster, and as '17 has
been successful in everything he has ever gone into, the banquet is sure to be a success under his direction.
At the same meeting, Mr. Fe was elected manager and will begin at once to make arrangements for the banquet.
The class feels sure that under the leadership of these two capable men, the annual Soph banquet held in February
will be one of the very best ever held by any Soph class.
