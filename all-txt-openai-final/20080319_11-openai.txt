In their most recent matches, men’s and women’s tennis both captured key victories to improve their records to 8-3 and 10-3, respectively.

On March 5, the men faced off against JMU in Hilton Head, S.C. The No. 1 tandem of Flaviu Simihaian ’08 and Ethan Jaffee ’09 aided in capturing the doubles point when they won their match by a score of 8-6. At No. 3 doubles, Walker Lyons ’11 and Sam Burns ’10 sealed the deal to win the initial doubles point by a score of 8-3.

All four doubles participants earned wins in the singles category, while Lyons and Burns accomplished their victories in straight sets at the No. 5 and No. 4 spots. Lyons captured his seventh singles victory, holding the second-best singles record on the team. The team-best record for singles goes to Scott Myers ’09, who improved his record to 9-2 after his 6-2, 6-0 win in No. 6 singles. Davidson won by a score of 6-1 in their last match until March 20th when Wofford comes to Davidson for SoCon play.

On Sunday, Davidson women’s tennis secured a shutout when they beat Western Carolina 7-0, improving their Southern Conference record to 3-0. Davidson is now a perfect 20-0 all-time against Western Carolina.

To begin the afternoon, Davidson’s Kelsey Linville ’08 and Virginia Berry ’10 started off with an impressive 8-1 win in No. 1 doubles. Overall, Davidson is now 30-9 in doubles matches on the season.

Both Linville and Berry also won their second consecutive singles matches in straight sets at the No. 1 and No. 2 spots respectively. Michele Fanney ’09 also had her second consecutive win in straight sets by a score of 6-1 and 6-2.

On the most impressive run on the team, Meredith Skeeters ’08 won her ninth consecutive singles match at No. 6 singles. For her impressive streak, Skeeters won SoCon Player of the Week honors.

The women’s basketball season came to an abrupt end in last weekend’s Southern Conference Tournament, as the third-seeded Wildcats (19-11, 13-5) dropped a 68-49 decision to sixth-seeded Elon.

The Wildcat effort was hamstrung by 31.7% shooting from the floor and giving up 32 points in the paint. The Phoenix placed four players in double figures, led by Kitara McMoore’s 19 points. Elon shot 55.6% in the second half to put the Wildcats away.

Honna Housley ’08 and Mercedes Robinson ’09 scored 13 and 12 points, respectively, to lead the Wildcats.

Davidson trailed by only one point, 36-35, with 11:50 to play before giving up a 15-4 run that essentially put the game away. Elon led 25-22 at halftime.

Housley, Katie Hamilton ’08 and Danielle Hemerka ’08 completed their Wildcat basketball careers against Elon. Housley owns a share of the school record for three-pointers in a game with six, while Hemerka and Hamilton each scored over 1,000 career points, the 10th and 11th Wildcats to do so.

“We had some good moments,” Alex Thompson ’10 said regarding the season, “but we’re disappointed with how it ended.”

The Wildcats did have some good news in the week leading up to the tournament, as Robinson was named to the all-conference first team by both the league media and coaches. She was also named Player of the Week for the final week of the regular season, the second time she was given that distinction.

Robinson led the league in double-doubles this season with 14, including 11 in conference play.

She also led the team in scoring (12.7), rebounding (8.5), steals (53) and field goal percentage (.531). She was third in the conference in scoring and rebounding and second in field goal percentage.

The Wildcats will bring back seven of their top 10 scorers next season, including three of their top five. They will also return four of their top five rebounders as they try to build on the success of the past season.

The men’s golf team traveled to Buies Creek, N.C. on March 3rd to face off in the Lonnie D. Small tournament. Campbell University hosted the 36-hole tournament over Monday and Tuesday on the fine fairways of the par-72 Keith Hills Country Club No. 1.

The ’Cats were led to a ninth-place finish by the smooth strokes of up-and-coming Ryan Crum ’11 and Robert Mayo ’11. In his own Tiger Woods moment, Crum shot a second round one-under 71. He paired this with an opening round 74 (+2) for a two-day total of 145 (+1) that placed him tied for 9th on the individual leaderboard. Like his peer, Mayo came out blazing on day one with an impressive one-under 71.

Mayo followed narrowly behind Crum with a 36-hole score of 146 (71-75) that placed him just outside a top 10 finish. Rounding out the solid play by the Wildcat golfers were David Fowler (57 / 156), Michael Saari (T-62nd / 158) and Bobby Urso (T-62nd / 158).

The Campbell Fighting Camels won the Lonnie D. Small Classic with a two-day total of 583 (294-289). Elon squandered a five-stroke lead after day one to finish second to Campbell with a total of 583 (289-295).

The Wildcat golfers will compete next Monday, March 24th at the USA Spring Golf Classic hosted by the University of South Alabama in Mobile, Alabama.
