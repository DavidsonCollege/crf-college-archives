Have you ever heard of cloisonné? This art form is as alien to an average Davidson student as Davidson is to an average Northerner. “Cloisonné,” explained John Highsmith, “is French for ‘partitioned.’” Cloisonné is an intricate type of enameling characterized by wire partitions that separate colors. The wire is bent into shape and placed on a piece of copper. Various colors of powdered glass are then fused onto the design by baking the form in a kiln.

John, a freshman pre-med major, began enameling in an exploratory art class in high school and for the past four years he has specialized in cloisonné. By reading books, talking to professional enamelists, and constantly working, John has become an expert. His only summer job is selling the necklaces, trays, and candy dishes which he enamels.

When asked where he gets his designs John answered, “I seek my inspiration from fellow artists.” (In other words, he steals them.) They are mostly geometrical, though there are some scenic views and a rendition of the Rose Window in Westminster Abbey. Each design must first be formed out of wire. “This is the most time-consuming part,” says Highsmith. “It takes ten to fifteen hours to finish an average piece. It relaxes me.”

For any interested enamelists, John is working out a probable cloisonné course. “When I came for my Davidson interview, I brought some of my work and Admissions said they'd find a way for me to continue it.” Now, under the sponsorship of Dr. Ostwalt, John is planning a spring term class. The course, officially under Extended Studies, will be offered to five students. The Union may provide the necessary space, specifically the Arts and Crafts Room. The Union will also foot the bill for the two hundred-dollar kiln. Nothing about the course is certain yet, but hopefully by spring term the arrangements will be complete and Davidson will have one frustrated artist.

...Eva falls short of Superstar fame with the second song on Side Three, starts with Che questioning Eva as to her rise to power. Eva evades his questions, and instead begins preparations for her tour of Europe, which is forthcoming. “Rainbow High,” which begins this part of the story, is perhaps the best song on the album. The music, while not very good, is probably the best on the album. But what makes the song really stand out is the combination of Rice’s lyrics and the vocals of Julie Covington, who portrays Eva on the album. Covington expresses the haughtiness of the new Argentinian first lady, and Rice’s lyrics give vent to Eva’s acquisition of power. An example is, “I came from the people, they need to adore me, so Christian Dior me...” turns out not to be the success she thought it would be. In fact, it turned out to be a failure. The last song on Side Three and the whole of Side Four portrays the founding of the Eva Peron Foundation. While very few...People in Argentina benefitted from it, those who did spread her praise, and soon she was treated as a saint in the country. This feeling of power and public acceptance went to her head, and she tried to talk her husband into letting her run for the office of Vice-president. At the same time, opposition to her grows to an all-time high in the military. She also finds out that she has cancer, and gradually begins to lose her strength. As her life draws to a close, she laments whether or not her life would have been longer and happier if she had led a simpler life.

Where Webber and Rice succeeded with "Jesus Christ Superstar," they have failed with "Evita." The concept of a rock opera based on the life of Eva Peron had some potential. But one gets the feeling from listening to the album that they decided halfway through the album that the concept wouldn’t work, yet decided to finish it anyway. The album is marked by repetitious music, and a copying of the style of music which made "Jesus Christ Superstar" so successful. The music on this album lacks the driving force of their previous work. The only saving graces are the lyrics of Rice, and the vocals of Covington. Next thing you know, they’ll be writing a rock opera based on the life of Sam Spencer. I don’t know what they would entitle it, but "Give My Regards to Williams" would be appropriate.

The remainder of the third side depicts her tour of Europe which CLOISONNE BOWL and her life would have been longer and happier if she had led a simpler life.
