To Davidson Students, Faculty, and Administration,

It is my conviction that this campus is no fun. Students here seem afraid of fun. Everyone takes college too seriously. Granted, if all I wanted to do for my college years was party, I wouldn’t have come to Davidson. I know that the majority of Davidson students enjoy learning and school, and that is one of the best things about this school in my opinion. But it seems to end here. The supposedly elevated reputation of the school, and the somewhat prehistoric notion that Davidson “boys” come out as “gentlemen” who need no introduction, have precipitated a holier-than-thou attitude that is almost unbearable, and an obsession (especially on the part of the administration) to protect Davidson’s “image.”

Two cases in point. Hattie’s Night, Davidson’s infamous (and only) blowout party was scheduled for Thursday the 25th, but was cancelled because it was felt that the party would give the prospectives visiting for SGA weekend a bad image of what Davidson is like. That is a good point. We wouldn’t want the prospectives to think that we at Davidson ever, even occasionally (once a year!), overindulge. I’m sure the prospectives would enjoy being treated to a huge party when they come up. They might even come specifically for Hattie’s. Unfortunately, that is not possible now because no one knows when it is going to be. It is an incredibly paternalistic attitude, and it extends to the students too. The point is, the administration and the SGA seem to feel that we have an image to protect. I'd like to think we have an image to destroy.

Another example of this image dictating is the cancellation of the assassins game. Granted, the game is about “killing,” but we are mature enough to realize that it is only a game. My God, it’s only for fun! Who does it hurt? These are two very specific examples, but the problem is evident everywhere. And it is not just a lack of scheduled parties. People around here don’t know how to have fun unless it is planned by a frat or the Union Games Committee. I have lots of fun, but no thanks to the College as a whole. Fun has to be created here. If I say to someone, “Let’s do something tonight,” they always say, “What?” Why do you have to have a reason to have fun? Fun is fun. If you ain’t got fun, you ain’t got squat.

A friend of mine commented on how wonderful it was here the night of the Carolina game, because everyone was happy for once. That’s sad. I don’t know what it was like because I wasn’t expecting any fun, so I went to Chapel Hill. That was fun.

I’m not proposing a way to change this.Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

To continue doing the right things, I don’t think they will just be- cause I wish they would. What I want to say is, it doesn’t have to be this way. There is nothing wrong with being serious, but don’t take yourself or your job or your studies too seriously. It leads to a stiffening of the upper lip and a deflating of the personality. Remember, when you’re representing Davidson College you’re also representing yourself. Are you really being yourself? Are you having fun? Really? Think about it. Jeff Holland ’84

3. We require that letters be signed and include the author’s phone number and address. If you have a compelling reason for us to withhold your name, explain your situation to the editor, Stewart Cauley.
4. We reserve the right not to print letters that (a) function as advertisements; (b) contain innuendo, off-color slurs, or inside jokes; (c) represent a viewpoint very similar to that already expressed.

Most work for cancer is being done by people like Madeline Itza and Theresa Barbieri. They met when Madeline was in treatment for breast cancer and Theresa was the volunteer who drove her to her therapy appointments. Now, like Theresa, Madeline is bringing help and hope to others as a Reach to Recovery volunteer. The work in the lab must continue. So must the work outside.
