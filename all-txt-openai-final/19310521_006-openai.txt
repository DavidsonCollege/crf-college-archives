FAST TRACK

A track man will tell you that records are broken when the track is fast. Think of this setting—a cool evening, the stands overflowing, the whole spectacle brilliantly lighted with G-E floodlights, and a fast track—a record simply couldn’t stand the “gaff.”

Nighttime, when people naturally turn to diversion, is the logical time for a track meet. Lack of support will be a thing of the past. And just watch the athletic fund grow.

G-E floodlighting projectors, largely the development of college-trained men, are easily adapted to any occasion whether football, track, tennis, commencement, receptions, or plays. Efficient G-E illumination promotes athletics and builds school spirit.

For further information address Publicity Department (E). Ask for GEA-1206 — “The Light That Started Sports at Night.”
