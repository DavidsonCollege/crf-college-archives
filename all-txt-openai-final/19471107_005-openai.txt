Early Feasts at Christian University

One professor at Christian University decided to put an article on a difficult question before religion students. Cecil F. Chesterton
asked Mr. Cain for an answer. When he repeated the name, he was greeted by silence. Finally, he stepped to
his desk, flipped through his cards, and grinned sheepishly at his discovery. "Sorry, folks," he apologized, "there is no Mr.
Cain. I'm thinking of Mr. Ables."

A MODERN PARABLE

There was a friend of ours who lived in a particularly densely populated section of Brooklyn. Now this man was
intelligent and well-informed—so well-informed that he came down with a disease common to our times: bombphobia. He would lie awake
nights in his hot Brooklyn apartment and while he was not bordering on hysteria, his thoughts would go something like
this: “Well, if they come over and drop it, where are they going to drop it? Where it will do
the most damage, that’s where, and that’s here, right here.” And he would sweat away the remainder of the miserable
night.

Finally, he could stand it no longer. He packed his bags and moved to the far reaches of Alaska. One
day his nearest neighbor said, “We’re going to have to move any day now.” “Why?” asked our friend, who was
just beginning to get used to the place. “Great heavens, man, do you want to get caught? When they invade,
where do you think they'll come from? Right across the Strait, right through here, that’s where they'll come.” So our
friend packed his bags and moved.

At last, he came to the Great American Desert in the southwest part of the United States. “At last I
have escaped,” he said, “but has anyone else?” And just at that moment came a monstrous explosion. Our friend never
heard the accompanying explosion. And when the scientists came to study the crater made by this rocket testing, there was
a young scientist among them who kept insisting that the inhabitants had seen the rocket fall. The scientists, living in
Dartmouth, Hanover, overheard at an overcrowded university: Coed, “On a clear day, I can see Davis Cleaners.”

With the return of flashy Carl Sheppard, the Davidson offense will see action here. Salisbury’s own Buck Williams, prior to

Dodds connected with the great Youth for Christ movement, which has been sweeping across the country and now the world
in recent years. Several doubtless will recall Davidson's Professor Al Winn’s stirring message at Charlotte Youth for Christ last year.

The men's college dances are at a lull for November as far as I am able to observe, but I'll
give you the word as soon as something breaks. Mary Baldwin-Saint Mary's: None other than our own Dr. Chingman is
to be the speaker for the inauguration ceremonies of Mary Baldwin's new president, Dr. Lewis. The news story rated the
headlines of The Campus Comments. I was not surprised to find that the enumeration of his many accomplishments took a
great deal of the front page.

The Belles of Saint Mary’s has recorded that the Carolina, Duke, State, and Wake Forest men have gone on to
act by painting their campus with “huge, crude letters.” Did they not like the style, or do they prefer these
women that are always ready to be a match for a male of ambition?

At most schools, fraternity and sorority rushing is the event of the day about this time of year. Of course,
we at Davidson know that this practice arises from gross ignorance on the part of the administration of other colleges.
The greatest majority of colleges have not learned the trick of thrusting fraternities at a freshman before he finds out
that he is not in bedlam or Penn Station at rush hour. We evidently fail to show a crest to
the degree that the powers-that-be feel that we are unable to regulate our personal schedules to allow for a rush
program like every other school has. It is worth bringing up that the percentage of fraternity men at Davidson runs
considerably higher than at other colleges. Could this not be explained by the fact that the freshman pledges a fraternity
before he has time to study everything demanded of a fraternity man? But it must be considered that it is
believed that before a man comes here, he has no reasoning ability with which to study the situation. In my
humble way, I believe that fewer men would pledge if they were aware of all that is involved. I wonder
if these powers are working to fatten the pocketbooks of the national fraternity organizations.

Wide-ranging research of the foremost college publications of the nation has made a conclusion. The student bodies of the nation’s
colleges are much more conscious of world affairs than they were before the war. As a result, it is reflected
in their publications in the form of editorials and articles dealing with the more serious business of world affairs. THE
DAVIDSONIAN has also tried to follow this trend with articles by Dr. Brown and Professor Vinkney. We appreciate very much
their contributions. But is the faculty the only people around here that are interested in the outside world? I know
that there are men in this student body that saw the full fury of war, and yet it seems that
all many of them can think about is wine, women, and song. Are there none that can see beyond their
own egocentric sphere? Would not THE DAVIDSONIAN be a more fully rounded publication with some sound observations contributed by men
that are seeking an education at college? How about some of you aiming to be citizens of tomorrow's world giving
our schoolmates some dope on world affairs, but do not neglect the problems of our society, from the personal right
on out. Have the numerous literary organizations got nothing to contribute?

On the lighter side of content, the issue of the “new age look” continues at full tempo. The Topics of
U. Va has a report that the length is still at the knee and that they are just playing in
Paris, making Americans the suckers that they are. At Stratford, the poll seems to indicate the girls are pretty much
in favor, while at Queens the opinion is slightly against it. Some women even dare to point out their reason
why the longer skirts are better, but whoever heard of cold reasoning behind much of the stuff women don and
a swabby's summer uniform? The girls at Notre Dame voted 79 to 21 percent that “men’s trousers should go up;”
16.6 percent vote little above the ankles, 72.2 percent below the knees with cuffs of contrasting colors, 5.5 percent, six-inch
cuffs, and 5.5 percent, overalls.

The Daily Tar Heel of Carolina reports that Paris is cooking up a new look for men. It seems to
be something of a time saver.

With prices and the war situation what it is, I hope the American girl feels proud of herself when she
buys a new wardrobe, since the world in general is in great need of all the available clothing material. People
in other lands will go almost naked for the lack of fabrics, while some women wear excess wool for fashion’s
sake. (The Coe College Cosmos, Cedar Rapids, Ia.)

The Betas held a margin in first downs, 3-2. In a close and hard-fought game, the S.A.E.s managed to eke
out a victory over the Phi Delts; the score was two first downs. The charging game was featured by brilliant
defensive ball. Slippery ground lines kept the scoring down, and neither team was able to break their backs into the
clear or to complete any long passes. Neither team was able to stop short by frequent pass interceptions and hard-charging
linemen.
