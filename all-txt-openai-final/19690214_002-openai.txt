**Davidsonian Goals: Professionalism And Rebellion**

This, gentle reader, is our last editorial. A new editorial “we”—perhaps more competent, certainly more eager—is already crowding us off the scene. They begin reforming the world and Davidson College next week.

Once we were eager, too. Eager and a bit brash, and not a little naive about the place of a student-run newspaper on this campus. But that was a year ago. We are eager no more.

Over the last year, we’ve been called a multitude of things—meddlesome, reckless, untrustworthy, inhumane, dull, irrelevant, and irreverent—to name just a few. We are, we’ve been told, fuzzy-thinking intellectuals. Or a wise-ass. A dumb-dumb. We've been painted every color in the spectrum, but most often yellow and red. Sometimes only pink. We've been threatened with lawsuits and other, more base attacks on various parts of our anatomy. And a prominent trustee once ordered us not to “go off half-cocked and stir up controversy.” We ought to be watching educational television instead, he said.

All of these were expected, though: they come with the job. Their absence would undoubtedly mean that THE DAVIDSONIAN is not functioning as it should. We realize, you see, that we have often been extreme. That invites reaction. We confess also to being occasionally misleading and, at times, inconsistent. A couple of times we have been flat-out wrong. Those invite reaction, too.

But what we haven't gotten used to in a year’s time is the incredible ignorance—the distressing naivete—of the college community about the role of a student-run newspaper at Davidson. Somehow; somewhere—certainly not from us—many people here have gotten the notion that THE DAVIDSONIAN exists for reasons other than printing the news and raising hell. This newspaper, they think, should reflect the college only in the best possible light. If something nice or praiseworthy happens, their perverted theory goes, THE DAVIDSONIAN should shout it for all the world to hear. But if something not-so-nice were to happen... why, to wave the college’s dirty linen in plain view is pure blasphemy!

Those people are only sadly mistaking us for the college news bureau, that 9-to-5, coat-and-tie outfit paid to grind out administration-approved white-washes on pretty yellow paper. We don’t have any yellow paper, and we think such notions are ridiculous. You can’t be a “good guy” and a good newspaper, too.

The naivete about THE DAVIDSONIAN doesn’t stop there either. It runs, unfortunately, much deeper. Most students love to hear us trying to lecture the administration or scold the faculty or make fun of ODK. That's o.k. But when we strike closer to home, then it’s not o.k. anymore. Maybe the truth hurts.

There is this idea in a lot of student body leaders that THE DAVIDSONIAN should be everybody’s pal, skipping along, arm-in-arm, with the student “government,” the football team, the IFC or what-have-you toward some kind of nebulous nirvana. We should, this theory says, be a constant cohort in the fight for the student Cause. What these students haven't bothered to do, however, is to figure out precisely what the Cause is. Abolition of the curfew and compulsory chapel, liberalization of drinking rules and open dorms policy, the need for a new snack bar—maybe those fit under the category of the Cause. If they do, then in the last year we have, in some respects, been fighting for it.

This professionalism is at the heart of the matter. Simply stated, it’s why we act the way we do. A professional newspaper gathers the news and reports it—straight and hard, regardless of whether it happens to be “convenient” for the community leaders and without wondering “how the trustees will react to it.” THE DAVIDSONIAN, over the last few years, has tried very hard to be professional. In many respects, we have succeeded; we have the awards to prove it. But in others—because we are immature and inexperienced and because there are not enough hours in the week to be creative and because we cannot seem to arouse a lethargic student body—we have failed.

With those who object to our way of doing things, we agree that it is unfortunate that the “outside world” often has only THE DAVIDSONIAN for its source of campus news. Perhaps we should have two student-run newspapers. To those who complain that we “manufacture” news, we offer this: any newspaper manufactures news, in one sense or another. For good or ill, the “news” is, after all, usually what the news media make it.

With those who complain that we are too serious, we are in partial agreement. But as long as we strive to operate on professional guidelines, we will lend a certain dignity, perhaps undeserved, to campus events and organizations. To those who think we are unrepresentative, we call attention to the other five columns on page two. We solicit—nay, covet—letters, particularly those with other points of view, and never in recent years have we refused to print one that was signed.

And finally, to those who find us too liberal—extreme, some would say—we would offer the reaction of a distinguished Davidson alumnus when he returned to campus last year for a visit: “... I felt a bit unhappy with what I saw. The question is: how do you preserve Davidson's strength and, at the same time, bring the faculty and students into realistic relations with our messy and trying times? I've no answer.”

We don’t have the whole answer either—but we're looking. What we've tried to do for the last year is suggest likely solutions. That is why we want Davidson to chunk its traditional view on admissions policy and seek out more diversity. Why we want the college to arrange for the admission of female students. Why we want our campus social set-up to be revamped. Why we want our ROTC program, without a doubt one of the best and most flexible in the country, to be bent a little more and become voluntary. Why, in short, our editorial policy is often one of constructive rebellion.

For our critics, there is no let-up in sight. For the new editorial “we” is likely to be just as extreme and meddlesome and confounded ornery as the old. If they aren't, then they are not worth their journalistic salt. But if you still persist in your objections, there is something you can do: join the staff and impress your opinion on the editors. The staff is completely open and completely voluntary—and we always need people. Just come up to the office on the second floor of the Union almost any night. We'll be there until at least 3.

**An Editor's Obituary**

Personal friendship and much respect for Robbie Hooker have prompted this tribute. This is the obituary and eulogy for Rob, who is stepping down as Editor-in-Chief of THE DAVIDSONIAN. For eight months this newspaper has been his obsession. Whatever competence and interest this paper has demonstrated during his editorship can be traced, to a very large degree, to Rob’s own competence as a journalist and to his enthusiasm for his job.

That THE DAVIDSONIAN appeared every Friday was in large measure due to Rob’s spending 30 hours a week editing copy, writing editorials, reading proof, attending meetings—and a couple of times, actually delivering the papers in the dorms himself, whenever the circulation people loused up. This newspaper was his life.

Rob is one of those very rare people who are complete perfectionists. And if putting out the best newspaper possible meant staying up to 3, 4, 5 a.m., then Rob would do it. He frequently did. He would also get up and go to an 8 o'clock class the next morning. He has spent countless weekends studying when everybody else was out partying, simply because he had no other time to study. This newspaper was Rob's sacrifice.

For no pay, and for very little glory, Rob did all of this. When you put your whole life into a job, criticism is hard to take. Rob is thin-skinned; he took criticisms of THE DAVIDSONIAN'S shortcomings to heart. Criticism hurt Rob in a very personal way, especially when the criticism was petty or unfounded, as it often was. As editor, many times Rob was pressured not to print a story that he, as a journalist, thought should be printed. Rob printed the news that he thought was honest news—stories about events that were actually newsworthy. Sometimes the publicity made people sweat; sometimes it made people mad.

With this last issue of Rob’s paper, I feel a sense of loss. The paper loses a completely dedicated editor. In another way, I feel another loss. This is my last column, the last of my own personal tirades. I will miss the writing, just as in June I will miss Davidson—the people and the institution. My God, what can I bitch about then?

**Rogers Laments Walkout**

To The Editor:

It is evident to almost everyone that something must be done to improve the quality of assembly programs. Unfortunately, the answer is not an easy...one to find. I cast my vote in favor of voluntary chapel, but this decision must come about in an orderly way and not by unnecessary radical means. For a long time now, I have watched student resentment against compulsory chapel grow. It has taken the form of sleeping, reading books and newspapers, and even laughing at the speaker. But never have I seen conduct more juvenile and ridiculous than the walkout staged last Thursday. Fortunately, only about 75 persons were involved, so in terms of what the leaders expected, it was a complete fiasco. Nonetheless, it disgusts me that some Davidson students don’t have any more respect for speakers than their actions showed. It is inconceivable to me that after Dr. Spencer's opening remarks anyone could think of walking out. Dr. Spencer, along with the other members of the administration and faculty, realize there is a problem and is taking steps to do something about it. The Code of Responsibility has been used as an excuse to justify the walkout. Some fail to realize that responsibility is a two-way street. Half the students involved allowed their emotions to guide their actions, and I doubt whether they would make the same decision again. In any case, the student body should take another look at its future goals, and then work with, not against, the administration and faculty for desired changes.

A Tale Of Wonderland

The cat was beginning with the end of the and ending with the fan... vanished quite slowly, too. “Well! I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,” thought Alice, “but a grin without a cat! It’s the most curious thing I ever saw in all my life!” —Lewis Carroll

Tucker Says Relevance Not Found At Davidson

To The Editor:

Last Wednesday night a feeble effort to engage students in a discussion concerning the problems of Davidson College was attempted. “Feeble” implies not my disagreement with those involved in the Open End, but rather the two or three-hour time period granted to the students not wholly caught up in the Davidson dream.

Passionate Proposition Pressed
By SANDRA EARLEY
In The Profile (Agnes Scott)

Don't look now, girls, but Davidson College is propositioning people. Yes, collectively. They're looking for coeds or at least their campus newspaper, THE DAVIDSONIAN, would have you think so. It all started way back last fall with a series of editorials. It has progressed now to the point of informal polls to measure campus opinion on the subject and interviews with the college president concerning a merger with suitable girls’ schools.

In an editorial entitled, “Where the Girls Aren't,” the reasons favoring such a merger were stated: “Davidson needs girls. Academically, they would contribute new viewpoints and new competition. And socially... well, we need to learn to judge a girl on criteria other than the color of her dress, the length of her hair and how much she puts out.”

An interview with the college president in the Nov. 1, 1968, edition of THE DAVIDSONIAN quoted him as saying, “My position at this point is that I am sympathetic to the idea of coeducation.” On this happy note, another editorial, “It Takes Two, Baby,” in the same issue propositioned the first school. It noted that Sweet Briar is making rumblings about coeducation, then suggested the two schools get together. The next two editorials called attention to what other schools are doing, citing studies at Lehigh University and Princeton which showed coeducation preferable.

Like that identification bracelet every girl in the seventh grade wore at some time during the year, the most recent Davidson proposition has gone out to Mary Baldwin. This editorial said, “There are good deals at Mary Baldwin... Baldwin is a merger ‘mate that any haughty bachelor would be proud to get. It has satisfactory academic standards and a student body of 750 women.”

Well, ladies, it's happened again — somewhere along the line when they were passing out propositions, we got left out. And we can't even drink in our dorms. Maybe merry ole Davidson should look south rather than north. Atlanta is a very nice city and there are 750 of us with better than “satisfactory academic standards.” Besides, we might even put on our pretty please for them. Not only that, we already have self-scheduling of exams, which Davidson students are currently striving for.

For me to enumerate the things I consider wrong with Davidson would require more time than Kimbrough has taught here. How about a college? We have Burts running around trying to write down the names of the heinous sinners who cut chapel and the average salary of Davidson's janitors is less than $70 per man per week. Shaw Smith tells us that it’s a College Union rather than a Student Union and a Union Board member remarks that it is “brash and discourteous” to have a “peace” table next to the Marines. Clean sheets on a mattress enforced by Sgt. Penley and polished shoes and brass at ROTC drill may mean “good deals” and a commission while thousands of yellow people are dead and thousands of domestic blacks sleep with rats. Student responsibility well-meaning papa and profs means attention during awful assemblies and we get two nigras a year to dent the waspish image and counter-service only to non-student blacks in “public” accommodation. A foreign student to play tennis and Homer promises a Duke game soon. If Davidson were burned and replaced by a marijuana farm, better would the humanitarian instinct prosper.

Whipping Past

Davidson's Fuzzy Destination

Vespers. Monday chapels. Suspension for drinking. These former hallmarks of Davidsoniana are as foreign to most students as national fraternities and Saturday classes will be to undergraduates of the future. Few students can remember the stir created years ago when an Honor Court member turned in a fraternity brother for possession of a beer can in his car. The student involved was suspended. Or better yet, remember those arguments against abolishing Vespers? If you don’t, then change the wording in some of the arguments for compulsory chapels and voila. And for all the criticisms of student government and its devotees, Joe Murphy and Peter Hobbie bear little resemblance to the smiling but inert people who have represented the student body at alumni luncheons for years.

Over the years, the changes have been generally accepted. As a result, there is such an air of change around here that everyone has accepted fluctuation as a normal state of affairs. Nearly every candidate who put up a poster made some reference to “the time of change” here at Davidson. I suspect many of them have little idea what this state of change involves or what it may ultimately bring. Through all this change, I suspect Davidson really doesn’t know what it wants to be or should be. In short, this school is experiencing an identity crisis.

Davidson has had this crisis on a low level for years. “The Princeton of the South.” That's what supporters of the school have called it for years. I guess they figure that since both Davidson and Princeton were founded by Presbyterians, this in some way bound the glory of one to the other. It’s like tracing your ancestry back to William the Conqueror. But seriously, must Davidson always pattern itself after other schools? Must it try to make itself into something it is not? Such a course ought to be labeled “The Duke Syndrome.” Sometime soon, someone here must decide whether there is a place for a small, church-related basically middle-class college, or whether social demands have made all institutions except the mass-related ones irrelevant. Should Davidson drop church affiliation just because it is a secular age? Should Davidson lower admission standards, or should it remain a college where academic prowess and intellectual ability stand higher than color of skin? Up to now, it seems that more eyes are fixed on the road than on the destination.

Kaylor, Newman: Appeals Court Is Not That Powerful

To The Editor:

The article in last week's DAVIDSONIAN concerning the judicial opinions rendered by the Court of Appeals may well have been misleading for many people. Aside from the question of the merits or demerits of the opinions themselves, the Regulations Court does not recognize the authority of the Court of Appeals either to hear appeals from the Regulations Court or to interpret the Code of Responsibility. The Code of Responsibility has been accepted by both students and faculty and approved by the trustees, and therefore the judicial system which it contains is considered competent to adjudicate cases and to interpret the code. The Court of Appeals has no recognized competence at all, since the SGA Constitution which provides for it has not been accepted as yet by the faculty or trustees. Therefore, members of the college community would be well advised to regard any pronouncements of the Court of Appeals as merely the opinions of those students who make it up and not as having any binding force. One might note also that if the Court of Appeals should be given the powers outlined in the proposed SGA Constitution, we might as well dispense with the student Senate, the faculty, the administration and the trustees, since the Court of Appeals would be assumed competent to govern the institution — which, of course, is one of the ‘minor’ problems holding up the approval of the SGA Constitution.
