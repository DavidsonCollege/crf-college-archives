**EDITORIAL**

**YOUR PART**

The Davidsonian wants your opinions. If you are an alumnus, a student, or just one interested in the college, and have an opinion, whether it be a criticism or commendation, and think it worth putting before twelve hundred subscribers, each with their circle of friends, and all interested in the college, then send your article in to us and we will see that it has a place.

To the alumni and students especially do we make this appeal. It is not because we do not have enough to fill the paper. Each week, with barely touching the surface, we have more than enough material for the paper. But we realize that at best, the Staff and Reporters represent only a very small portion of the college.

Let us have your ‘pet’ theories, especially if they be ones which you had when you were in college, and which have been strengthened by your life since leaving college. Or it may be that as a student, with the more intimate knowledge of student affairs, you have worked out something worthwhile, and if so, we do not believe that it will be given better attention than through these columns.

We believe that it is in your power to strengthen The Davidsonian two-fold by your active interest. Without reward, outside of the experience gained, we are endeavoring to put out the best possible paper. Will you do your part?Missionary Circle will meet Thursday afternoon at 4 o’clock with Miss Nora Thompson.

CLASS BASKETBALL

It is planned to run a short schedule of class games, and also to have different leagues in the sport, comprised of dormitory teams, sectional teams, etc.

SUCCESS OF COLLEGE MEN

“Since the United States was founded, only one man out of every seven hundred and fifty has gone through college, yet from this group have come 17 of the presidents, 19 of the vice-presidents, and 17 of the persons in the Hall of Fame. Only 1 percent of our present population are college people, yet this small percentage furnishes 29 of the 51 governors of states and territories, 61 of the 93 United States senators, 272 of the congressmen, and 9 of the 9 Supreme Court judges.”—Exchange.

The first call for the last year’s Varsity baseball squad was sounded Monday afternoon, and the uniforms were distributed. The first appearance of the squad at batting practice drew an interested speculative audience from the student body.
