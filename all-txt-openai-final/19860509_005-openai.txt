### Shakespeare Class Performs Twelfth Night for School

Throughout this weekend, the English 212 “Performing Shakespeare Comedy” class will give their production of William Shakespeare’s *Twelfth Night* in
Lingle Chapel. The production is part of the overall grade in the class. The students, under the guidance of Professor
Cynthia Lewis, have each taken a role in the play in addition to dividing responsibilities such as costuming, publicity, and
props. Using research and scholarly interpretation, and directing the play as an ensemble, the class hopes to present a production
as close as possible to the style and manner of the Elizabethan theater of Shakespeare’s time.

Lewis explained that the students use performance as a means of critical analysis. “One doesn’t really understand any play until
one looks at it from the inside,” she said. “I had written two articles on the play before starting it
with this class, and already I’ve learned much more than I had known before.”

Never was identity more mistaken than in this Shakespearean romantic comedy. First published in the 1623 Folio, *Twelfth Night* tells
the story of a young woman, Viola, shipwrecked off the coast of Illyria, who disguises herself as a man in
order to serve the Duke Orsino. Orsino is suffering from unrequited love for the Countess Olivia and sends Viola to
woo her, but Olivia, believing Viola to be a man, falls in love with her instead. A subplot involves Olivia’s
rowdy uncle, Sir Toby Belch, and his cohorts, Maria, Sir Andrew Aguecheek, and Fabian, who contrive to trick Olivia’s puritanical
steward, Malvolio, into believing she harbors a secret love for him. *Twelfth Night* contains the infamous “letter scene” in which
Malvolio is duped by the revelers into foolishly dressing in yellow cross-gartered stockings to impress his bewildered mistress.

The cast has been entirely responsible for making and decorating the sets, choreographing the action on stage, and providing costumes,
as well as all other elements of the production. The cast includes senior Forrest Williams as Orsino, sophomore Max Currie
as Viola/Cesario, junior Catherine Norton as Olivia, sophomore Elizabeth Dick as Feste the jester, sophomore Lance Luckey as Sebastian, senior
Alison McGill as Antonio, sophomore Lee Eichelberger as Sir Toby Belch, junior Steve Mank as Sir Andrew Aguecheek, junior Wayne
Magruder as Malvolio, senior Anne Lambert as Maria, and senior Katie.

### Vivian Lester Remains Faithful to Her Calling

By Nelle McCorkle

After working all day as a Charlotte Human Services secretary, Reverend Vivian Lester often sleeps until 11 p.m. before waking
to study the Bible. She reads until three or four a.m., then goes back to sleep until she rises at
six a.m. to begin another workday. Assistant pastor at Reeves Temple African Methodist Episcopal Zion (AME ZION) Church, Lester maintains
this schedule because she considers Bible study essential.

“I really stress this to people: read and know the Word. The Word is the only thing that’s going to
defeat the Devil, so if you don’t know the Word, you’re going to live a defeated life. Get that Word
hid down in your heart, so when you need it, it'll be there.”

A minister since 1982, Lester joined Reeves Temple when she was 12 years old. “I’ve always been active in the
church, even as a child,” she said. “I continued to be active before I received my salvation — I sang
in the choirs, I worked as youth director.”

Of her decision to become a minister, Lester said, “It was something I didn’t want to do — I tried
to get out of going into the ministry by teaching a Bible class for children, but I didn’t have peace
within myself. It was as if there was a void, and this was because I was not in the complete
will of God. I wasn’t where He wanted me to be; He wanted me to be a minister. A lot
of things happened. God was showing me His will through His word and through His dealing. When I said, ‘okay,
I'll do it,’ it was as if a burden had just lifted.”

Lester’s duties as assistant pastor include preaching once a month, assisting Pastor Thomas Lee with communication and congregational visitation, and
substituting during services he...is unable to attend. She also serves as Sunday school superintendent, frequent adult teacher, substitute in all
departments, and choir gospel member. Asked whether being a Davidson native helps her in her ministry, Lester said, “I don’t
know whether it does... Sometimes when people know you in the community, it’s hard for them to separate you from
the individual they know in the community into a sacred position, as they would call it.”

In addition to her Reeves Temple responsibilities, Lester works on the town’s Community Relations Committee, speaks at area churches, and
participates in an interdenominational intercessory prayer group which meets on Saturdays in members’ homes and served on a recent college
community relations committee. Mooresville radio station WHIP broadcasts “Good News,” her program of “little nuggets or sermonettes,” each Sunday from
8:15-8:30 a.m.

“My main objective,” Lester said, “is first of all being faithful and true to my calling as a minister and
to do what God would have me to do as part of the body of Christ.” Lester’s future plans include
the establishment of a Davidson shelter: “One thing I want to go into is starting a Love Center — you
know, if somebody’s walking down the street and feels as if nobody cares, it’d be a place where they could
go and talk to somebody or read the Word of God... It would just be a place of refuge... in
love in the Greek, agape love... with no conditions. It would be a place with no conditions, and I'll be
trying to reach mostly the lowest because Jesus’ main purpose for coming here was to save the lowest, and as
disciples, that should be our main objective.”

“Being a minister is really a joy to me, because... you can help somebody in the darkness see the light
and see how God can change their lives and set them free from the bondages of sin... I enjoy preaching
the Word of God and sharing Jesus with others,” Lester said. “I felt within my spirit that this was what
God was calling me to do,” she said of her ministry. “It's sort of hard to put into words, but
you just know what the Holy Spirit is impressing within your spirit.”

Before becoming a minister and a Human Services secretary, Lester worked for Social Services’ Dalton Village Day Care Center in
Charlotte as a toddler teacher and aide from 1975-1981. Prior to that time, Mecklenburg County school system's Child Development Center
employed her as a teacher’s aide during 1970-1975. Lester attended Ada Jenkins Elementary School and graduated from Huntersville’s Torrence Lytle
High School. She has participated in Hood Seminary’s continuing education program and plans to pursue a religion degree there in
September.

Lester and her husband William Lester, a Goodyear front-end mechanic, live with her mother, Katie White. The Lesters’ son, Chris,
is a tenth-grader at North Mecklenburg High School, and their daughter, Sharyl, works at Suzy Curtains. Vivian Lester said, “Everybody
pitches in, and my mother is a big great help. When we come home we don't have to cook, because
she cooks for us every night.”

“I have come through some times where I had to stand by myself for beliefs, but the battle is the
Lord's,” Lester said. “We don't have to fight our battles: all you do is read the Word and speak the
Word, and the Lord will do the rest.”
