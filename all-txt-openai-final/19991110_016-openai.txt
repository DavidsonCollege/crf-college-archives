**The Wildcat Report**

Even though they took him out of New York, they just couldn’t take the New York out of Coach Bob McKillop. Invoking two quintessential Empire State traditions, McKillop articulated his hopes for the 1999-2000 season not only in terms of posts, zones, and lane match-ups, but also in the language of his home state’s two largest icons—Broadway and Yankee baseball.

“If there was ever a better team for us to look at in terms of what we need, it’s the New York Yankees,” McKillop mused. “When they step up to the plate, they have confidence in their players to take a pitch and not jump on the first one. That’s the perfect example of a basketball player—he has to be confident enough to pass up that first shot, realizing he may get a better one.”

That confidence will be the foundation to support the Wildcats’ 1999-2000 campaign to claw their way back atop the Southern Conference. As McKillop made no excuses at the end of last season for the way the Wildcats struggled to maintain point leads and to finish games, the players, too, realized the need for a more consistent level of play, and they responded, eager for the respect that comes with consistency.

“I think we’re an improved team,” said McKillop at the Southern Conference Media Day on Oct. 13 in Greenville, S.C. “Once we get experience, we have the opportunity to be significantly improved.”

Michael Bree, following a year-long apprenticeship under Ali Ton, is prepared to take over at the point. Gina Lawrence, the outside hitter who captured Southern Conference Player of the Week honors for Week 8, has played a significant role in Wildcat Volleyball’s 16 consecutive wins.

**The Frontcourt**

When Wildcat seniors donned black gowns and mortarboards last May instead of their traditional mesh shorts and Nikes, a void appeared in the roster, and nowhere was it more noticeable than in the frontcourt, which retained only two of its four experienced players—Landry Kosmalski and center Stephen Marshall.

Kosmalski returns to lead the frontcourt in his final season as the Wildcats’ marquee 6-foot-7 senior forward and two-time All-Southern Conference player. After a ’98-’99 season of averaging 8.6 rebounds per game, scoring a career-high 25 points against Elon, and leading the team in scoring with 13.9 points per game, Kosmalski enters the 1999-2000 campaign rated by Lindy’s College Basketball as one of the top twenty small forwards in NCAA Division I.

Kosmalski’s leadership will be critical this year, but McKillop is confident in his three-year starter whose command on the court is reminiscent of Mark Donnelley, a 1998 graduate and one of a select few to score over 1,000 points in his Davidson career. “I’m really excited about being a leader, and I think I can do a good job,” commented Kosmalski, coolly expressing the kind of confidence McKillop likes to see in all of his players. “I’ve worked hard to stay in shape for the season, and I’ve improved the mental aspects of my game. I’m a lot more relaxed this year.”

His role in the offense will vary slightly this year as Kosmalski shifts from his traditional post and perimeter positions to the small forward spot that he will be expected to fill much of the season. Having adjusted well to the change, McKillop insists Kosmalski is potentially one of the best players in the Southern Conference. “He’s gotten quicker and stronger,” said McKillop at the Southern Conference Media Day. “He’s positioned himself for his best season yet.”

Marshall, a 6-8 senior, has been preparing for the 1999-2000 campaign to be his breakout season and the Wildcats’ coaching staff is looking forward to nothing less. “Stephen is shooting well, he’s quicker, and he’s more confident in his ball handling,” said McKillop who claims Marshall has had the best off-season of his career.

Marshall’s command of his low-post game should make him one of the Southern Conference’s best, but also look for McKillop to capitalize on Marshall’s outside shot, often swinging him to the perimeter to keep defenses honest. A triple threat, Marshall is the best free throw shooter on the team with a 76.4 career percentage.

A second-year Marshall protégé, sophomore Martin Ides will see some time in the center this season as Wildcat coaches are anxious to increase the 7-foot-2 middleman’s game experience. Complementing the frontcourt will be 6-foot-9 sophomore forward Chris Pearson, a redshirt freshman whose highly anticipated talents will be seen for the first time by someone other than McKillop & Co. Having only begun playing basketball at the age of 12, and only then in casual pickup games, playing experience and knowledge of the Wildcats’ system have been goals for Pearson, and McKillop has been impressed with his development. “He is far more advanced than a typical first-year player,” lauded McKillop. “Having an extra year to embrace the system has been a plus for Chris.”

True freshmen forwards Michel Lusakueno and Jason Dickens already promise great things to the future of Davidson basketball. Lusakueno, a 6-foot-10 native of The Congo, brings to the program the ability to “do things we haven’t had many players do in recent years,” according to McKillop. His size and athleticism are tailored for the power forward role where he can be an imposing defender and aggressive rebounder. McKillop’s favorite term to describe the 6-8 Dickens is “hard-nosed.” He brings size, strength, and talent to the roster and will add further depth to the Wildcats’ lineup.

At the Point

In the backcourt, it’s déjà vu for McKillop. Two years ago, when McKillop graduated point man Chris Alpert with the Class of ’96, concerns immediately arose about the future of the program without Alpert, the Wildcat’s career assist leader. Ali Ton, an unproven talent, took over at the point in ’97 after a year under Alpert’s tutelage and went on to lead his team to the NCAA tournament a year later for the first time in over 10 years. By the close of his senior season, Ton ranked third nationally and first in the Southern Conference in assists. The scenario replayed itself, only with a different cast, following the graduation of Ton last May. Michael Bree, the 6-foot Irish guard, apprenticed under Ton for a season, preparing him to succeed Ton at the point. But could Bree really compensate for the loss of Ton, people wondered. “Yes,” McKillop answers emphatically and without hesitation. “I am very confident with Michael.”

“Coach McKillop recruited me to do a job and has confidence in me, and I have confidence in myself,” said Bree, responding to the speculation surrounding him heading into the season. “I don’t worry about what other people say.”

Enter a new character: Fernando Tonella, a 5-foot-11 sophomore transfer from New Mexico State, who will challenge Bree for playing time and will supply needed depth at the point position. After sitting out his first season at NMS, Fern

Six-foot-7 senior forward Landry Kosmalski came to Davidson with a chance to prove himself, and has done so thus far by quickly picking up the nuances of the Wildcat offense. The shooting guard spot boasts the flexibility that McKillop loves as seniors Davor Halbauer and Jeff Bergman can pull duty at the small forward spot as well as fulfilling their traditional guard assignments. “They have confidence in our system,” said McKillop of his two most versatile guards. “And I’m very impressed by the way they are embracing and coaching the younger players.”

Halbauer, a 6-3 native of Croatia, got his first start in the third game of his sophomore season and has developed into the Wildcats’ premier three-point threat, having connected on 59 triples last season, which was more than double any other player on the roster. Even when Halbauer isn’t scorching the net, he creates shots with slashing drives and an excellent view of the field. Jeff Bergman is a 6-4 senior who earned a place in the Wildcats’ regular rotation as a junior, averaging 4.3 points in 21 games. Quick off the dribble and a shooting threat from the outside, the only questionable aspect of Bergman’s game is his health. Over the last three seasons, Bergman has
