**Conway Discusses Importance of Multiculturalism**
By Russ Tisinger

Ishmail Conway, Director of Student Activities at Cornell University and lecturer, spoke last Thursday in the 900 Room about the
importance of embracing multiculturalism. Conway emphasized the value of simply understanding and experiencing other cultures and peoples and highlighted the
need to understand other cultures in a world that is becoming more economically and culturally interdependent.

Conway began by noting that although people generally think of multiculturalism as a new word, it is by no means
a new concept. It is a fact that Americans live and have always lived in a culturally diverse society. As
college students, we experience this multiculturalism every day. Students bring their own set of cultural norms to universities. Given that
situation, the important issue is to take advantage of that multiculturalism—to “make it work” as Conway says. By that, he
means we should expose ourselves to people with different ideas and customs because we come away from it a little
wiser. By learning about the differences between certain cultures or people, you also discover the commonalities between them. People can
only stand to benefit from such experiences. So, Conway urges, if multiculturalism is to “work” correctly, we should not stand
in isolation from our multicultural situation we live in, but instead immerse ourselves in it.

At the same time, Conway stressed to keep a clear idea of who you are. He made the distinction between
the multiculturalist, who seeks to understand other people and cultures and tolerates them, and the assimilist, who tries to adopt
a new style of living that is not truly consistent with who that person really is. One should recognize the
differences in people, respect their beliefs, and look at interacting with them as an opportunity to learn.

Conway identified four phases that people generally move through in developing a multicultural attitude. The first, and probably the most
comfortable for people, is isolation. It is easy for people to go to a university and isolate themselves in groups,
whether they do so by color, language, or sexuality. In isolation, people reject situations of change. The second phase is
inquiry. By simply talking to people and asking them questions out of curiosity, you learn useful things about them. Too
many people are too timid to approach those who are different from them.

**Student Conduct Council Makes Changes In Honor Council Policy**
By Tom Koonce

In the 1990-91 Annual Report of the Student Conduct Council, some changes to the Code of Responsibility and the Code
of Disciplinary Procedure were noted. Chairman Will H. Terry stated in the report, “The most notable change is that only
students may assist the accused in an Honor Code hearing.” Students may still seek help from lawyers, faculty, etc. in
preparing their defense, but only students may take part in the actual hearing. A student may even have a lawyer
present at the hearing, as long as the lawyer does not actually take part. This change was made because a
staff member with law training took part in a past hearing.

When word of this new portion of the code reached some faculty, there was an initial concern about whether faculty
could advise students involved in an honor council hearing. Dean Terry clarified this concern, however, saying that the mandate was
meant merely to exclude faculty from directly participating in the trial itself. Terry said that the policy was in no
way intended to hinder faculty advising of students who request help.

The change in the Code of Responsibility consists of a new section.Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original

which separates actions which affect persons from that of property." The new section will aid the Honor Council in the
handling of acquaintance rape cases.

Cornelius Traffic Problems May Eventually Be Solved By Town

By: Tom Koonce

As a result of continued growth around the Lake Norman area, traffic problems have increased in Cornelius along Highway 73.
At various times during the day, traffic is often backed up considerably at the stoplight in front of the Food
Lion shopping center. Since Highway 73 has only two lanes and a short turning lane, it has become overrun by
this increased traffic amount.

Highway 73 is a state-owned road and was identified a number of years ago for widening. Cornelius Town Planner Richard
Jennings said that definite plans were made to widen this road two years ago. He said, “The problem is that
there is limited (state) money available for this project.”

Jennings said that the state has only a little less than half a million dollars set aside to acquire the
right-of-way for widening Highway 73. The plans call for the road to be widened from the overpass to at least
Nantz Road. Jennings said that it would cost a lot more than half a million dollars to acquire the right-of-way
for this distance.

Jennings is the first Town Planner that Cornelius has ever had. He said that he is having to go back
and fix a lot of problems that resulted from Cornelius not having a separate Town Planner before him. The plans
are therefore in the works for solving the growing Cornelius traffic problem in the congested area around the stoplight in
front of Bacon and Eggs. Jennings believed that the widening would come soon but he said, “Ultimately, the decisions are
left up to the state.”

There is not a whole lot more development planned for this area of Cornelius in the next few years. Jennings
said, “The town went through a stagnant phase because of the recession.” Developments that are in the works include a
residential community beside Knox Road and Highway 73 and an apartment—

Freshmen Experience Patterson Court

By Ross Sloop

Friday evening marked the first night that the Class of '95 participated in social activities at Patterson Court. For some
it was an unforgettable night, for others it is a night to forget. Sigma Alpha Epsilon got things rolling with
their 3:01 club. Freshmen and upperclassmen alike enjoyed the reggae band. They were in fine form as they—

With music from the reggae party filling the court, a handful of people enjoyed Davidson’s first autumn-like afternoon by tossing
frisbees and footballs on the field inside the court. A mysterious slip-n-slide was set up on the far side of
the court, but no one seemed interested in getting wet due to the crisp temperatures of the afternoon. Just as
KS and SAE began to wind down for the day, and people thought they might get a chance to—
