**Presidential Hopefuls Give Views On Campus Issues**

Jim Bootle, Henry Shue, and Verner Stanley, candidates for student body president, expressed their feelings on important campus issues today,
in response to questions asked by The DAVIDSONIAN.

1. Evaluate the work of the 1959-60 Student Council. What were the chief assets and strong points? What were drawbacks?

**BOOTLE:** While this year’s Council made few significant changes or advances in the field of student government, much of its
time was spent feeling out its own strength. This, in my opinion, is not degrading; its progress will be a
definite asset to the Council next year. Sparsely attended meetings as well as an unmistakable lack of interest on the
part of some few of its members were clearly drawbacks to efficient functioning of the Student Council, and left it
open to criticism.

**SHUE:** The chief contribution was, among others, raising the issue of the fate of students shipped for honor violations—whether one
favors or opposes a change in past practice, the question of the responsibility of a Christian college to a man
who needs re-direction is a basic one. The Council's chief drawback was that it couldn’t move because it was standing
on its own coat-tail in the sense that the Council couldn't find anything to do because it interpreted its scope
too narrowly.

**STANLEY:** The Council year, 1959-1960, was spent in searching vainly for areas into which student government could project itself. I
feel, however, that a more concise definition of the group’s function is now realized by the student leaders. Specifically, the
Council must act more as a “rabble rouser” in issues of controversy. The purpose and function of the new Council
must be redefined, however, for the benefit of the student body. Drawbacks to a more efficient Council were lack of
power to handle matters that pertained directly to the student. The Council also failed to assume the role of arbitrator
between student organizations; because of this failure, the Council repelled several opportunities to assume the role intended for it.

2. What do you consider the most important problems facing student leaders for the coming year?

**BOOTLE:** Perhaps the most important problem for student leaders will be winning the help and support of those students who
elect them. One person, opposed from all sides, can accomplish little, and will soon lose his own self-confidence.

**SHUE:** The one most important issue is the role of the Student Council. Other significant issues include: acting as gadflies
for the purpose of inspiring fellow students, faculty members, and trustees to develop a conscious and consistent philosophy of education
which faces questions like the tension between academic freedom and religious commitment.

**STANLEY:** To me, the most important problem facing campus leaders is in making sure that their positions do not become
mere figureheads. They must strive to initiate original ideas and to channel them into action. Also, existing is the problem
of interpreting student opinion by means of a poll or forum. It is their duty to relate these results, or
conclusions, to (Continued On Page Four)

Rising — Jerry Bussell and George Trask were elected first and second vice-presidents of the student body on Tuesday. Rising
— Ken Kelley was elected student body secretary-treasurer in a run-off with David Dillard in close voting. Voting will begin
Monday, March 21, for president of the student body. Presidential candidates Jim Bootle, Henry Shue, and Verner Stanley presented their
campaign platforms yesterday in chapel.

**Mimeographed Statements**

Elections board chairman Pete Kellogg stated, “If the candidates wish to make one-page statements in addition to their chapel speeches,
the elections board will mimeograph the statements and distribute them to the student body. This will be a means of
stimulating discussion of the issues.” Balloting will begin on Wednesday, March 23, to elect members of the Honor Court. A
student-faculty committee will nominate two students for each vacancy on the Honor Court, and additional candidates may be nominated Tuesday
during chapel by the respective classes.

**Proposed Amendment**

Today in chapel student body president Dee Green presented the following amendment to the Student Body Constitution: The order of
elections shall be: (1) Student body officers (2) Honor Court (3)

**Dole Sees No Championships; Wants Team In Conference By B. MILLNER Davidsonian Sports Editor**

(Editor's Note: This article is the last in a series of four investigating the relationship between subsidized athletics and the
academic program.)

In a DAVIDSONIAN staff interview last Tuesday, head football coach Bill Dole maintained that Davidson could continue to compete successfully
in the Southern Conference and defended the purposes of a subsidized athletic program.

**Q:** Do you think that Davidson can continue to compete in the Southern Conference?

**A:** “Yes. We've won fairly recent championships in tennis and golf and we came close in swimming this year. As
for football and basketball, this is the situation: There is a wide range of scholarship aid in the Southern Conference,
going from West Virginia on the top level to Davidson at the bottom. I certainly don’t think that we can
compete with West Virginia, and we don’t.

“I do not visualize Davidson College winning a football or basketball championship in the Southern Conference. But I believe that
it is worthwhile for us to stay in. If we got out, there would be many schools that we would
no longer be able to compete with, and the minor sports program would be seriously affected.”

Dole continued to point out that last fall's losing football season was an unusual case because of the advent of
the freshman rule. “We had five winning teams up to this year,” he said, “and I'm not ready to throw
in the white towel now. When it appears that we can't win in the conference, I'll be the first to
admit it.”

**Q:** But won't the freshman rule present the same handicap this year as last year?

**A:** “No, it'll still be a handicap, but not as serious. We have more sophomores than we've ever had, and
with the scholarship money I have this year, I hope to get 15 or 16 new boys and some without
aid.”

**Q:** What about the boy who

Davidson's second Alumni College will be held April 7-9. During the 44-hour “term,” 100 alumni will “Major” in one of
five areas. Dr. Hugh Holman of Chapel Hill, will be the keynote speaker on the night of the seventh, and
willspeak to the alumni, faculty, and students. Dr. Holman will lecture on “The Significance of Liberal Arts for Students.” He
will speak in chapel the next day. The Alumni College students will “major” in any of the following five areas:
America’s Historical Heritage; Science, Mathematics, and You; Literature Today and Yesterday; Philosophy and Religion; and Your Community and Your Business.
Alumni will participate in a total of six hours of study. On April 9, a “graduation banquet” will bring the
college to a close.

Seventy-five rising sophomores, juniors, and seniors above 1.5 will be awarded Dana scholarships having stipends of up to $800. Students
are encouraged to apply immediately. Selection will be based on a student's academic record, extracurricular activities, and financial need.

Q: What if a boy with an academic average doesn’t measure up—who just doesn’t have the ability to play college
football—do you let him keep his scholarship anyway?
A: We've never cut a boy’s scholarship. There is an NCAA rule against taking a boy's scholarship away from him.
Some of the Southern Conference schools are trying to get it changed.
Q: Would you like to see the rule changed?
A: I think that when a boy accepts a scholarship, the institution giving it is morally obligated. I don't believe,
in fairness to the boy, he should be cut adrift.
Q: What if he shows no desire to play and can afford to come to school without aid?
A: We've never had that problem here because of the integrity of the boys who come here. I've had boys
come in here and tell me they'd like to give up their scholarship because they've realized they can’t play football
for us.
Q: What do you consider the purpose of the Davidson College athletic program?
A: I think that athletics is an integral part of the total educational program. I think a boy who competes
in athletics, regardless of the sport, is learning some lessons which are hard to get anywhere but on the athletic
field.
Q: Would you like to see the rule changed which provides that funds for athletic grants are to be a
certain percentage of the general fund?
A: No, I think this is a very healthy arrangement. Because now, everything comes through the college and there is
less confusion.
Q: Do you feel that you get enough to compete in the conference?
A: We need a little more and I think eventually, we'll get it. Sometimes scholarship programs are a waste—but you
have to have enough boys to get the job done. Our problem last fall was that we only had 32
boys. That wasn't enough. Ideally, we need from 40 to 44 boys.
Q: Is it correct that football scholarships are based on ability rather than need?
A: I try to consider need. But if I find a boy who is a good football player and I
have to give him a scholarship to get him to come to Davidson, I'll give him one.
Q: But can you justify giving aid to a boy who could otherwise afford to attend Davidson, while other students
have to struggle to get through?
A: Yes, because of the society we operate in. The Southern Conference subsidizes and we have to subsidize also to
compete. Also, I think a boy has to be unusual to keep up his grades and play football too. I
think he needs some incentive.

Russell, Trask, Kelley Win Posts
YMCA, Publications, Freshman Advisor (4) Class presidents and Student Council elections were held outside chapel, but with the polls easily
accessible to all students in the lobby of Chambers, I see no reason why everyone should not be able to
vote.
If the proposed amendment is passed by the student body, balloting for YMCA, Publications, and Freshman Advisor will begin on
April 4th. YMCA presidential candidates will speak in chapel on March 31st.

Kellogg On Voting
Regarding the number of students who are voting, Pete Kellogg said: “Voting is running a little better than usual outside
chapel, but with the polls easily accessible to all students in the lobby of Chambers, I see no reason why
everyone should not be able to vote. I feel one of the main reasons that students have not been voting
is that they feel that they don’t know anything about the candidates running. I hope everyone will make an effort
to inform themselves of the qualifications of the presidential candidates so they can vote intelligently.”

Queens-Davidson Day Scheduled April 1st
A Queens-Davidson field day, sponsored by Alpha Tau Omega fraternity, will be held Friday, April 1, at 4:30 p.m. in
the football stadium. From 7 to 10 p.m. Loomis McGlohon’s Combo will play for a Sock Hop in the Gym.
Proceeds from the Field Day and Sock Hop will go to charity.
Charles Roberts, director of the Queens-Davidson Olympics, stated, “The Queens sororities are going to send teams over to compete in
a chicken-catching contest, a tricycle race, a sack race, an egg-throwing contest, and other events. We're also having a scooter
race with Davidson and Queens faculty members competing. At the intermission of the Sock Hop a trophy will be awarded
to the sorority that wins the Olympics.
For the competition to select the Ugliest Man On Campus, each fraternity will be asked to enter one man. “We
hope they'll come dressed as obnoxiously as possible,” Roberts added. A trophy and a ten-dollar gift certificate will be awarded
to the winner.
Friday night the seventy Queens contestants will be guests of the ATO’s for dinner. The rest of the girls here
will eat at the fraternity houses and in the Student Union. “The Queens girls are so enthusiastic about the idea
of a Field Day that they claim about three-fourths of the student body will be over here,” Roberts remarked. “The
ATO chapter at Emory originated the idea, and IFC will sponsor it next year.”
