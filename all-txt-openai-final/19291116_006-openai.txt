THE DAVIDSONIAN, NOVEMBER 16, 1929

MEN WHO MAKE WILDCATS WILD

“MONK” YOUNGER
“TEX” TILSON

Younger and Tilson Perform Feat of Keeping Everybody Pleased

“Give fifteen rahs for Monk and Tex,” oftentimes yells the Davidson College cheerleader, and, when the leader and his assistants
start their contortions in front of the stands, the Davidson student body yells vociferously. Were members of the football team
in the stands, it is believed that their voices in unison would be greater than the entire student body, because
of the respect and admiration they have for these two popular mentors. Furthermore, should the alumni of the college take
an active part in the cheering, they, too, would be just as anxious to give expression to their feeling of
loyalty and backing for the two men who direct the destinies of Davidson's athletic teams.

Ever since W. L. (Monk) Younger and S. D. (Tex) Tilson came to Davidson in the fall of 1923 to
take over their coaching staff duties, their popularity has increased. No matter how lean the final results of contests of
the season may be, it in no way affects the attitude of the students, players, and alumni toward these two
men. No rumblings of dissatisfaction, and no rumors of displacement ever go the rounds of the alumni, because they have
learned that the Davidson coaches are excellent instructors and are handicapped only by the lack of material.

During the past three years, the scores of football games show that Davidson has lost more contests on the gridiron
than it has won. But not one voice has been raised in protest, which is considered a joint tribute both
to the alumni and Coaches Younger and Tilson. The latter have shown their worth when they have promising football players
to drill, and Davidson alumni know that when there is not a dearth of athletes they can expect glowing returns
from the tutelage of Younger and Tilson.

Work as Partners

Monk Younger is head coach, but one would hardly realize it to see him and Coach Tilson working together. They
work in close harmony in perfecting Davidson’s athletic teams, and each consults the other. It is never necessary for an
emphatic order to be given, for each values the judgment of the other, and frequently go into a consultation, only
to emerge with a joint opinion, with no dissension from either of them.

Coach Younger, who devotes the major portion of his time to the backfield, played at Davidson College during the intercollegiate
year 1915-1916. It was in the days when freshmen could play on varsity teams, and he forged to the forefront
by making four letters his first year at Davidson. From here he went to V. P.

NOTE—NC following a player's name indicates that player is a letterman.I. and was a great end on that eleven before
the United States declared war and he aligned with Uncle Sam’s forces.

Camp Praised Monk

When V. P. I. played Yale in 1916, the late Walter Camp witnessed the contest, and afterward he went to
V. P. I’s dressing room personally to congratulate Younger upon the game he played at end that day. Before coming
to Davidson, Monk coached at V. P. I. and was an assistant coach at the institution when Tex Tilson was
playing his last season for the Gobblers. Tilson develops Davidson’s forward walls, and the word “develops” is used in its
truest meaning. For three years Davidson has lost by graduation practically a complete line, and it has been necessary for
Coach Tilson each fall to take inexperienced material and whip it into shape. Davidson’s line defense is so well known
that an elaboration of this phase of the coaches’ activity seems superfluous.

During his undergraduate days at V. P. I, Tilson was a tackle of enormous power, and was a member of
the V. P. I. eleven that met the famed Centre College team. He was in the line that held Centre
to a 14 to 0 score after the Praying Colonels had tamed Harvard the week before. In 1922 he was
captain of the V. P. I. team that held the still-going Centre eleven to a 10 to 7 count. It
might be added, parenthetically, that Davidson tied the V. P. I. boys the next week, 7 to 7. It was
perhaps this demonstration that influenced Younger as a coach and Tilson as a player that led to their advent to
Davidson the following year.

The amiable feeling of Davidson students and alumni toward the Davidson coaches is reciprocal. Coaches Younger and Tilson are reticent
most of the time, but one day they talked at length of the pleasure that was theirs in working with
Davidson students. They admire the splendid fighting spirit of the players as much as do the spectators, and it may
justly be added that if the truth came to the surface, the Davidson boys fight because of them, for they
do not play for the grandstand and as individualists, but as a team, and as a team they play for
their coaches.

DAVIDSON FIVE AND TEN YEARS AGO

FIVE YEARS BACK

On Tuesday, November 11, Armistice Day was celebrated with an R. O. T. C. Battalion drill in the morning, followed
by appropriate exercises in Shearer Hall, at which Mr. Lockhart of Charlotte was the principal speaker. “America and the Battle
of Verdun” was the subject of a very stirring address delivered to the Davidson student body, faculty, and townspeople by
Lieut.-Col. Thomas J. Dickson last Thursday.

More than a score of charming young ladies from the Greensboro College for Women will be in Davidson on the
night of Thursday, November 20, and will entertain the students with a varied and entertaining program of vocal and instrumental
numbers.

The Wildcat jinx that has lingered for years on Wearn Field lifted Saturday when Monk Younger’s well-oiled Davidson machine drove
full steam through the pack of Clemson Tigers which had gathered together at Charlotte, Davidson winning 7-0. For the first
time since the bright days of 1917, a snarling pack of Wildcats drove the historic Tiger foes back into their
jungle lairs and brought home to their “Alma Mammy” another belt of victory.

Homecoming day, November 15. In those few words is more meaning than appears on the surface. It means the bringing
back to the Davidson campus of many alumni. It means further that perhaps the greatest game in the history of
Davidson will be played against the University of North Carolina Tar Heels.

The Davidson Wildkittens defeated Oak Ridge 35-3, last Thursday with the greatest ease, seldom going less than eight yards a
plunge. Mid-air harmony from aviator whose chute failed to open, “I’ve Got a Feeling I’m Falling.”

TEN YEARS BACK

Fighting like the fierce quadrupeds from whom they are named, the Wildcats went down into defeat before the steamroller of
North Carolina State College by a score of 36 to 6. Although handicapped by nearly 30 pounds difference in weight,
the Presbyterians were in the game with all they had and gave their opponents a hard battle from start to
finish.

After several months of training and several minutes of entraining and several seconds of detraining, the Wildcat R. O. T.
C. battalion arrived in Charlotte on the last day of last week, and marched to Wearn Field, to watch the
Davidson-State game. After snaking the gridiron, the supporters of the darker hues returned to their seats in the bleachers, in
close proximity to the delegation from Queens which was supporting the Davidson warriors with a zeal that made the best
ever given a Davidson team, bow to the support of the sister institution.

The climax of Davidson’s football schedule will occur Saturday when the Red and Black warriors meet the University of North
Carolina at Winston-Salem. The Wildcats will be out to prove that last year’s victory was no fluke, while on the
other hand, the Blue and White will put its straight line-up into the play to wrest victory from Coach Crayton’s
lads.

The reception given at the Manufacturers Club of Charlotte Saturday night in honor of the Davidson and State College boys
was a very enjoyable affair.

At the suggestion of Tim Pharr, who assists Coach Crayton with the football team, a fund is being raised for
the purpose of giving every member of the team a gold football. Mr. F. L. Jackson, registrar, will be glad
to receive your contribution.

The seniors sent a petition to the faculty requesting that the seniors making 85 or over on any ticket be
exempt from the final examination on that ticket. The faculty, at its last meeting, granted the request.
