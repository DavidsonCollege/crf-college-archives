All-State Team Will

Sophomore End

Be Chosen This Week

Davidsonian Sports Editor to Publish His Choice in Next Issue

Appearing in the next issue of “The Davidsonian” will be an all-State football eleven and the names of those men receiving honorable mention to this team.

It will be picked by the sports editor of “The Davidsonian,” four members of the Reporters’ Club who have had past experience in sports writing on “The Davidsonian” staff, the editor-in-chief of this paper, and the alumni secretary, who has seen all the games in which Davidson has participated this year.

The players will be picked largely on their showing against Davidson.

Each of the seven men will pick three teams and choose a captain for each. Players being chosen for the first team will be given five votes, those chosen for the second team, three votes, and those chosen for the third team, one vote. The man chosen captain will receive one extra vote.

Any other player receiving one or more votes will be awarded honorable mention.

PREDICTS CRIME WAVE

Col. Calvin Goddard, director of research in Northwestern University’s crime detection laboratory, predicts another major crime wave within the next few months.

Coley Windham, playing his first year of varsity football, has been outstanding on the flank position. Windham has had the job of holding down “Shrimp” Morris’ old position, and has showed up well throughout the season.

ing with injuries of a severe nature. Percy McElrath, center, who sustained a sprained arm in the William and Mary game, and Fullback “Schnozz” Willson, handicapped by an injured knee, should both see action.

After a short lay-off following the contest with W. and M., the ’Cats renewed training last Wednesday, and have been drilled extensively for the past five or six days.

The last game played by Wake Forest this season was the one with Carolina, on November 11. Since that date, the Baptists have been making thorough preparations for the coming imbroglio. The varsity has scrimmaged frequently with the freshmen, and the first-string men have received stiff opposition from the yearlings, who are reputed to have the strongest freshman team in the state.

Following are the games played by Wake Forest and Davidson this season:

Wake Forest 0—Duke 22.
Wake Forest 0—State 0 (tie).
Wake Forest 0—Catholic U. 12.
Wake Forest 0—Clemson 13.
Wake Forest 0—Carolina 26.

Davidson 6—Elon 0.
Davidson 0—Carolina 6.
Davidson 28—Wofford 13.
Davidson 6—V. M. I. 0.
Davidson 7—Duke 19.
Davidson 6—State 6 (tie).
Davidson 24—Citadel 6.
Davidson 12—William and Mary 7.

Since 1908, Wake Forest and Davidson have played twenty games. Of this number, ten have been won by the Wildcats, six by the Baptists, and the remaining four have resulted in ties. During the last ten years, the ’Cats have captured only one of the nine games played, that victory coming last year when Halfback Charlie Pearce intercepted a Deacon pass and ran 60 yards for the touchdown. The contests in which the two teams have engaged during the past twenty-five years follow:
