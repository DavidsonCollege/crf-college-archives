...for more focus in their later years. The present system is too rigid. Because of the decreased course load and the possibility of blocked classes, the exhaustion factor is moot. Again, this 3-2-3 course load possibility allows for easy transfer of semester system credit for students on leave from Davidson. Furthermore, with the “two course term” there is a greater adaptability for terms studied abroad. The benefits of independent study and the restructured core curriculum are retained in this modified term system. Finally, motivated students could take the ninth course for either broadening his or her horizons, or to make up for lost credit.

After examining the facts, not to mention all of the hypothetical and situational by-products, one finds no substantial reason for acceptance of the Educational Policy Committee’s proposed semester package. Ultimately, the benefits of semesters are in the interests of the faculty and administration, with professors teaching one less course and fewer registration and exam periods. The other supposed benefits of semesters are negligible in light of a modified term system. The issue of semesters versus terms should not be clouded with curricular and/or calendar concerns. These issues are distinct and separate from each other. What needs to be decided is whether we as students will allow the proponents of the semester package to skirt student opinion and welfare, and ignore the reasoning of faculty who disagree. The decision process has been taking place over the last year and, though all are not in agreement with this statement, the process has not been on the table of the college community as a whole. Though a curricular change and the benefits to be reaped thereof are welcome, there is no logical connection to the term/semester issue. Do not allow this “package” to slide into acceptance because of curricular advantages, and in doing so do away with the advantages of the term system.
