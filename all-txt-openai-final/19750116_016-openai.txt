Sixteen: The Davidsonian

Ever Wonder What Davidson College Has Up Its Sleeve?

So do we. And every Thursday during the academic year we publish The Davidsonian to let you know what we’ve found out. But we need your support. We can’t follow the Wildcats, watch administrative policy, cover extracurricular Davidson, and bring you the editorial opinions of students, faculty, and others associated with the college if we can’t afford the paper to print it on.

A subscription to The Davidsonian for the rest of this academic year is only $3.00. If you’re not subscribing now, or know someone who isn’t, consider supporting us with a subscription.

And if you’re not contributing to our Letters to the Editor column, consider dropping us a line from time to time to let the college community know where you stand.

We cannot afford to publish the kind of newspaper we want to produce with our present limited budget. In other words, our financial situation may be dictating our news coverage.

Make checks payable to:

We’ve pledged ourselves to put out the best newspaper we can. But we can’t respond to the news at Davidson if you’re not responding to us.
