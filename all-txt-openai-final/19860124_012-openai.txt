AH-HEM. THE ROCKS’ CONCERNS COMMITTEE MEETING WILL NOW COME TO ORDER.

NOW, HOWEVER, ROCKS OF ALL SIZES ARE BEING MOVED ABOUT AGAINST THEIR WILLS. A PRIME EXAMPLE IS THE NEW EVIL OF “ROCK EMPLOYMENT” — MAY I CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO...

NOW, THE FIRST ITEM ON OUR AGENDA IS THE INCREASING PROBLEM WITH NON-INDIFFERENCE.

SURELY, ANYTHING AS MOTIVATED AS THIS “ROCK EMPLOYER” IS CERTAIN TO DOLE OUT EXCESSIVE NON-INDIFFERENCE. THIS WILL GET THE BEST OF HIM.

THESE ARE BUT A FEW OF THE WAYS WE ROCKS ARE BEING EMPLOYED.

HERE HERE! IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ANYTHING AS MOTIVATED AS THIS “ROCK EMPLOYER” IS CERTAIN TO DOLE OUT EXCESSIVE NON-INDIFFERENCE. THIS WILL GET THE BEST OF HIM.
