Beaux Jones ’08 led the Wildcat men by finishing second in the javelin throw with a toss of 186 feet 5 inches. The throw was good enough to set a school record, beating the previous mark by nearly two feet.

Will Funderburg ’09 turned in another strong performance in the shot put, placing fourth with an effort of 50 feet 6.75 inches. Kwame Som-Pimpong ’09 finished fourth in the triple jump after jumping 46 feet.

Alex Hoyt ’09 led the Wildcat distance athletes by finishing seventh in the 1500 meters in a time of 4:00.59. “We’re looking to improve on our solid results from UNC at our first home meet in three years,” Hoyt said. “We hope a lot of fans come out to support us.”

The Wildcat women were led by Megal Atias ’08, who won the steeplechase in a time of 11:22.31. The time also set a new school record, beating the previous mark by nine seconds. Kennesia Martin ’09 scored a fourth-place finish in the triple jump with a mark of 36 feet 11.75 inches. Emily King ’09 and Heather Conarroe ’11 led the distance athletes, finishing fourth and sixth in the 3000 meters, respectively (10:56.22 and 10:57.60).

The baseball team dropped all three games of its weekend series against The Citadel but bounced back on Tuesday with a win over Wake Forest. This win breaks a nine-game losing streak for the 'Cats and improves their record to 9-22 overall.

Friday night, Brett Shore ’09, Zach Kayne ’09, and Chris

inning against The Citadel on Sunday. Kayne drew a one-out walk which Matt Webb ’09 followed with an RBI double. Weiss drove home, and Tommy Piacenza ’10 drove in two runs with a double later in the frame. The Citadel responded to this early scoring and drew even with Davidson by the fifth inning.

With the score tied 7-7, The Citadel again pulled away from the Wildcats, this time when Chris McGuiness stroked a two-run homer with no outs to spark a five-run inning for the Bulldogs. Using this offensive cushion, Bulldog relievers Raymond Copenhaver and Matt Reifsnider combined to allow one hit and three base runners during the last four innings to preserve the victory.Losing streak finally broke on Tuesday as the Wildcats beat the Demon Deacons 9-3. Webb led the charge offensively, going 3-6 while blasting a homerun and a double to drive in five RBIs. Chase Fitzpatrick ’09, Chris’ twin brother, also had a stellar night at the plate by going 2-4 with a homerun. 

After Wake Forest opened the game with a run in the first inning, Webb tied the affair with a solo homer with one out in the third. In the fourth inning, Matt Ray and Shore drew one-out walks, and Zach Kayne was hit by a pitch to load the bases with two outs. With the table set, Webb followed by driving in all three runs with a double down the left field line. The ’Cats added insurance runs in the seventh inning when Weiss drew a bases-loaded walk. Chris Fitzpatrick scored on an error in the eighth to solidify the lead at 9-2. Webb closed the game by pitching an inning of relief to shut the door on Wake Forest. Relief pitcher Andy Bass ’11 picked up the victory for the ’Cats, taking the reins from DeMuro, who started for the first time this season and pitched well, only giving up one run in his two innings pitched.

The Wildcats return to action when they host Georgia Southern in a three-game SoCon series this weekend. The first contest is set for 7 p.m. Friday at Wilson Field.

The Wildcats jumped out to an early 4-0 lead in the first inning by loading the bases and capitalizing on one hit batter and an error by the Cats. The Wildcats did narrow the deficit to two when Hugh Eden ’08 drove in Fitzpatrick and Kayne pushed across Shane Hammond ’11 during the third inning. Unfortunately, three Wildcat errors and the Meade homer allowed the Bulldogs to score four runs in the fourth to go up by the score of 8-2. Each team would push one more across, and the Wildcats lost the game 9-3.

On Saturday, Davidson was shut down by Bulldog pitcher Wes Wrenn who gave up only one run and one hit through seven innings of stellar pitching. Eden, Shore, and Danny Weiss ’11 all managed one hit during the game, but the Wildcats fell 9-1. There was one positive for the ’Cats: Bobby DeMuro ’08, the active career appearances leader, returned to the mound after an injury, giving up one hit in one inning of work. Matt Webb ’09 went 3-5 with a double and homerun in Davidson's victory over Wake Forest on Tuesday.
