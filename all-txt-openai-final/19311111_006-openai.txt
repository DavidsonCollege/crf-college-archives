DAVIDSON ALUMNUS LEADS Y. M. C. A. VESPER SERVICE.
(Continued from page 1)

He numbered Gideon's objections to leading the people as God commanded. Gideon first asked where were miracles to prove to
him that it was God. Dr. McSween believes that God works His miracles today through the surrender of human lives.
In his opinion, the greatest miracle on the march of the children of Israel from Egypt was Moses and the
way he led the people. He asserted that God created in Edison’s brain the idea of electricity and raised Wilson
up to teach human brotherhood.

Gideon then asked for a sign from the Lord. Dr. McSween pointed out that people now are hard to convince
just like Gideon. The third time Gideon said that God couldn't be calling him for such a great mission because
he was poor and of the smallest tribe. He continued that people ought to do what they can and let
God use them the way He will. That it is necessary to stand alone, for “heroism chooses loneliness rather than
compromise.” To emphasize his point, Dr. McSween gave an example and urged the students to be true to the standards
learned at home and fostered at Davidson. He said that leaders are needed that rise above politics and selfishness.

Finally, by way of illustration, Dr. McSween showed that a man who didn’t heed the call was a failure in
anything he undertakes. In concluding, his closing words were: “Go in the Strength...”of the Lord and you will make your
way prosperous and have good success,” Jack Mackorell led the service, Bruce Peabody, John E. F. Lake, and Charles E.
assisted by.

“I hiked Chesterfield right from the start. I don’t know a blessed thing about how cigarettes are made. But, of
course, I would want the tobacco to be PURE. And then I’ve heard that the blending is very important. I’d
want that to be done just right.

“Then the paper. I don’t like paper that you can taste—or smell when it’s burning. I’d want that pure too.

“Another thing. I want to smoke whenever I feel like it—without worrying about smoking too many. So I want my
cigarettes MILD.

“But the main thing, of course, is TASTE. I don’t care for over-sweetened cigarettes. I much prefer those that are
just sweet enough.

“Chesterfield seems to satisfy in every one of these ways. That is why I’d rather have a Chesterfield.”

SMOKERS tire of too much sweetness in a cigarette, and they don’t like rawness. For a steady diet, they want
a cigarette like CHESTERFIELD—a mild and mellow smoke, free from any over-sweetness or any harshness or bitterness. That's why more
and more smokers every day are changing to CHESTERFIELD. Good ... they’ve got to be good.

Moore prayed, Mrs. G. R. Vowles sang a selection, accompanied by Miss Hattie Thompson at the piano. Dr. H. M.
Moffett gave the dismissal prayer at the close of the program.

BETAS DEFEAT PHI GAMMS (Continued from page 4)

The Phi Gamm backs worked well as a unit and as a result it will be rather difficult to select
any particular outstanding player. It might be said, however, that “Rip” Montgomery tossed several beautiful passes and Joe Tyack frequently
broke loose on lengthy gallops. Chuck Wright also executed some fine blocking. In the Phi Gamm line, Billy Northern and
Bill Brown played stellar games.
