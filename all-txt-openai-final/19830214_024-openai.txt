QUEST'S END

AFTER ADAM ROSS' FATHER WAS MURDERED BY A CULT OF SATAN WORSHIPERS, HE'D COME TO GRIPS WITH HIS GRIEF. SO
HE CAME TO ENGLAND WITH HIS BEST FRIEND, CHRISTOPHER NETHERFIELD. BUT, AFTER A WEEK IN LONDON, THE NIGHTMARES BEGAN. AND
THEY ONLY GOT WORSE---

by SCOT MYERS

ADAM. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? I HEARD YOU CLEAR ACROSS THE HALL. ANOTHER NIGHTMARE?

YEAH. MY FATHER AND THAT WOMAN, ALEYTIS FOSTER. WELL, TOMORROW WE'LL GO AND LOOK HER UP.

MEANWHILE, GIMME A HUG. I THINK I NEED ONE, NOW.

OH MY GOD! A-ADAM?

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU WOULD BE SO STUPID AS TO PUT BOTH OF OUR LIVES ON THE LINE!

"THIRD DECAPITATION MURDER DISCOVERED." THIS LOOKS LIKE THE SAME GROUP THAT MURDERED MY FATHER.

I KNOW.
