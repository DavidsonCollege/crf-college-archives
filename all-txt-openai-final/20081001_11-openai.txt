Wildcat hitting errors gave the Mocs a 26-24 win. The teams were tied as late as 18-18, but the Mocs were able to pull ahead when Davidson made two critical mistakes. The Mocs claimed the set, 25-22. In the fifth, decisive set, the challengers were neck and neck, tied at seven-all. Chamblee’s serving streak brought the score to 11-7 and the 'Cats won 15-9 over the Mocs.

Monmouth scored two goals in the first half and the Wildcats were unable to claw their way back into the game. Both of these goals were on deflections in front of the net that snuck past goaltender Christa Goeke '10, who recorded three saves in 61 minutes. Rollek also made an appearance in the net for Davidson. The Wildcats never stopped competing after falling behind 3-0 in the middle of the second half. Davidson outshot Monmouth 7-6 and had six penalty corners to the Hawks’ four. The Wildcats made a very valiant effort but were unable to find the back of the net. Davidson shots came from Perry, van der Ven, Luckey, Lisa Landoe '10, and Sarah Addison '09. With the loss, the Wildcats became 3-3 at home and 3-7 overall. Even though it was a tough game for the home team, it provided experience for improvement. Midfielder Krista Jackson '12 had an optimistic view on this weekend’s performance. “This weekend was a turning point in our season because now we know what to expect and what to improve,” she said.
