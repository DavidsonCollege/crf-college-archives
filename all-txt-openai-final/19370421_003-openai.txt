TO HAVE FOUR DANCES

Heywood Hill, president of the Davidson Y.M.C.A. for the 1937-38 session, announced Monday that the new Cabinet for next year had been chosen. The fourteen men named are: Warren Gaw, chapel devotionals; Sam Newell, vespers; Hector McGeachy, publicity; Sherrard Rice, student life; Monroe Wicker, Sunday school; Rodman Williams, world evangelism. 

Tomorrow, in chapel, Joe Hunter, chairman of the committee appointed by the president to draw up final plans for the event to be held next year, will announce final plans for the Hall. 

Captain Aaron, P.M.S.&T. at Oak Ridge Military Academy, will act as chief judge and select his own assistants. A large silver loving cup will be awarded to the outstanding individual captain who has the best drilled company. In recognition of the honor, the colors of the winning company will be decorated. The best drilled platoon will receive a small cup for its prize.

Company Bounder Captain A. L. Bulwinkle was selected as the best drilled company last year in a similar contest. The winning platoon was the Second Platoon of Company D under the command of Lieutenant Joe L. Dees.

The annual proficiency inspection will take place May 14. The final parade will be held May 17, at which time commissions, rewards, and other honors will be given to the various men. Harlee Branch, AN, will deliver the awards.

The Davidson College Symphonic Band concludes its concert season this coming week when it will make two final tours. It leaves Thursday for a tour of the Carolinas and Monday again for the deeper South.

The thirty who will make the trip will be the guests of the Davidson campus. The invitation was read and accepted this morning at Queens-Chicora College. The girls will arrive in Davidson at approximately 1:00 PM according to tentative plans. They will attend the baseball game on Richardson field at three-thirty. Dinner will be served together in the dining hall at six-thirty. Then, at eight o'clock, the Red and Black Masquers will present “A Midsummer Night's Dream” in the auditorium of Chambers. After the play, there will be a gathering in the banquet hall for refreshments and entertainment by Chubby King and his orchestra. The Queens girls will leave Davidson at about ten-thirty. Fraternity houses will not be open.

The visit originated as an ODK plan to provide more social activities on the Davidson campus. After the plans passed the preliminary stages, they were turned over to the student body for completion. Wilbur Edwards, president of the student body, appointed a committee composed of Joe Hunter, chairman, Carl Carlson, and Jim Morton, to handle the arrangements.

Dr. Egbert W. Smith, a nearly world-famous evangelist, will set the tempo for Bowery Ball.meeting SPEAKS FOR VESPERS le vie; HL thy. f | a ny ies “for duty to the 65th Infantry at trp will leave in the afternoon) Morton which has worked out final Dr. Arbuckle attended a banquet isc Hdl Overts Gi ae eer: San Juan, Puerto Rico about the | for Burlington where they will play | detail: wiven | UK VEE ALLY et Mai = Nortlee i it i te \ Ral ii LEA alt \L first of September la concert that evening.
