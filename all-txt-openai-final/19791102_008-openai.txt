Men of Andorra reassure each other that “No Andorran has anything to fear.” The play makes its final weekend run
this Thursday, Friday, and Saturday at 7:30, 8:00, and 8:00 in Hodson Hall.

Art Gallery Auction

The annual Davidson College Art Gallery auction will be held at 3 p.m. Thursday, Nov. 8, in the gallery in
Chambers Building.

About 60 works by Davidson professors and students, as well as 19th and 20th-century prints by well-known artists, will be
on sale.

Proceeds from the auction will benefit the art gallery’s purchase fund. All items for sale will be on view before
the auction.

Take part in Davidson tradition. Join the crowd that enjoys the delicious pizza at Mooresville’s King of Pizza. The food
maintains an excellent reputation for being fresh, warm, and of excellent quality. Davidson students enjoy the relaxed atmosphere or the
take-out order service.

Munch on a pizza from King of Pizza and see how much you enjoy it.
