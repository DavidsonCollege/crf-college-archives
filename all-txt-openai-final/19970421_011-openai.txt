Making it happen

Campus rallies to support the earth

By Seth Clippard

On April 22, 1997, people across the country will be taking part in an event known as Earth Day. This
will be the 27th time this event has been celebrated. In some areas, people will petition members of Congress to
support legislation that helps preserve and protect the environment, while others will stage powerful demonstrations against corporations whose practices pose
an immense threat to the future sustainability of our environment.

The point of all this is to get people to wake up to the situation humanity has brought about. That
is, to realize that the earth and all it contains cannot suffer the abuse we have given it—just as each
individual cannot and should not be subject to life-threatening devastation.

Senator Gaylord Nelson was concerned about the direction we were headed regarding our use (or, rather, abuse) of natural resources
in 1963. (Yes, even then there was alarm.) So, over the years, he worked to raise the country’s awareness about
the necessity of conservation as an integral part of progress.

By creating a day in 1970 where environmental concerns took top billing on the national agenda, he hoped to reverse
the currents of environmental destruction that had already grown into rapids. In his words, “Earth Day achieved what I had
hoped for. The objective was to get a nationwide demonstration of concern for the environment so large that it should
shake the political establishment out of its lethargy and, finally, force this issue permanently onto the national political agenda. It
was a gamble, but it worked.”

Indeed, it did work. An estimated 20 million Americans took part in the first Earth Day.

Davidson will continue to give life to this event on Tuesday, April 22. Earth Day will be held on the
Union patio from 11 a.m.-2 p.m. There will be food provided and live music performed by various students.

More importantly, there will be representatives of both on-campus and off-campus groups that share a concern for the environment or
are working for its preservation. Among these groups are the Sierra Club, Carolina Raptor Center, the County Waste Reduction Dept.,
the Economics Department, Recycling Committee, Environmental Action Committee, and Catawba Lands Conservancy. Students, staff, and faculty will have the opportunity
to learn more about various environmental issues, get involved in these groups, and learn what can be done to keep
the earth in shape.

Remember, Earth Day IS every day. The earth is our home, so let’s keep our feet off the coffee table.
