SPIRIT. Davidson College has always been considered unique. In tradition and truth its ideals and ideas have been different from
the vast majority of other colleges of its kind. Among the colleges of North Carolina, Davidson is singular in having
but one department; the academic, and in many of its principles it stands alone. But as long as the name
of Davidson is associated with those things that make for student strength and alumni loyalty and a wide sphere of
influence, it is an honor to be unique. Two words that quickly suggest one another are “Davidson” and “spirit.” The
Freshman before he enters college and the Senior long after he leaves, both hear the phrase as a symbol of
the power behind the throne in all of Davidson's athletic and literary successes. It is spoken of as a sort
of magic power, at a distance. Alumni of every class proudly point back to “the old-time Davidson spirit” when they
were in college, a thing that made Davidson unique. But what does it really stand for? It is not a
vague intangible force that rests upon the campus like the atmosphere and captures regularly the heart of every new man
that comes. It is variable, not constant. It is what the students are and think and feel. Every class adds
to or weakens it. Every man helps to increase or diminish it. How long will the Davidson spirit be unique?
It will be unique as long as the Davidson student body throws itself, heart and soul, into every activity of
the college. It will be unique as long as every student stands behind every team to the last inch. It
will be unique as long as a victory is counted glory, but a hard game and fair fight, no less
glory. It will be unique as long as we depend upon the enthusiasm of the square jaw as much as
the enthusiasm of the throat. It will be unique as long as every Davidson man is working for Davidson and
for everything that will make her better. The Davidson spirit depends on the spirit of every individual student. “COME IN!”
The office of “The Davidsonian,” in 19 South Chambers, is open for a half hour after dinner and supper for
the sake of everyone who is interested in the newspaper, and can bring suggestions and news. The box at the
door is open to any kind of contribution on vital and timely topics, any letters of comment or criticism. These
letters must be signed to be printed, though the name of the writer will be withheld from the newspaper if
desired. The office is yours, too. Come in! Any social news of the town will be greatly appreciated. Miss Maud
Vinson has kindly consented to accept the items to be published. The DAVIDSONIAN. April 8, 1914 WANT ADS. TRAINING CAMPS.
The criticism is often made of our American athletics and various college contests that such a select few of the
men in college actually engage in them. In Great Britain a much larger percentage of university students take active part
in university sports. This has led to a severe arraignment on the part of some critics of the methods and
purposes of American athletics. No college man will say that every team should represent the best that the college can
put forth, yet it is a discouraging feature that a large amount of its athletic and literary activities are carried
on by a small part of the men, and that a great number are content to have their share done
by proxy. The feeling that there is such a small chance for the average man through lack of experience and
advantage is largely responsible for this attitude. It is less noticeable at Davidson than at any of the larger institutions,
but an increased interest in “trying for the team” might be the means of bringing to the front some latent
and undeveloped talent. Every man has an opening to the big teams through the training camps this spring. If a
man wants to have a better chance for the baseball team next year (or a chance to learn to play)
let him go out for the class games this spring. It is better to muff a fly and strike out
trying than to sit in your room and bemoan the fact that your class has no team, or that there
will be no chance for you next year. The same is true of debating. Because only two men make the
debating team each year, and will represent us next week against Wake Forest, does not exclude the ordinary society worker
from the honor. At the close of the Fresh-Soph and Junior-Senior Debates this spring, there should be a dozen more
men eligible for the team next year. Fill the training camps! TO OTHER COLLEGES. The purpose of establishing The Davidsonian
has been not only to depict college life as we see it on our own campus, but as we see
it in other colleges. We feel that we are but one unit in the great army of American Colleges, and
it is our earnest hope that by the aid of our newspaper even closer bondsmay be knit between us and
these other colleges with whom we have so much in common. Your criticism and co-operation will be appreciated by us.
If you do not like our paper, tell us so, and tell us why. We will try to remedy the
defect. If you do like our paper, be sure to tell us, for the life of the amateur journalist is
one of trials and tribulations, and we are in need of whatever encouragement we may receive.
