Tye, Cause For Doubt

There was an all-round good-for-nothing man who died, and at his funeral the minister delivered a most beautiful address, eulogizing
the departed in the most glowing manner, praising his splendid qualities as a fine type of man, a good husband,
and a kind parent. About this time the widow, who was seated well up in front, spoke to her little
daughter by her side, and said, “My dear, go look in the coffin and see if it is your father.”

ATHLETICS
NICHES IN THE WILDCAT HALL OF FAME
No. 16 Louis Harrison Anderson, ’15
Football, Track

Davidson has always taken great pride in the men that have gone forth from her walls and especially those who
have shown a versatility in their college life that has enabled them to rise in the estimation and esteem of
their fellows. Louis Anderson was no exception to this rule, as can be attested by the enviable record that he
gained for himself while he was a wearer of the Red and Black. He was prominent in student activities as
well as on the gridiron and on the cinder path and was one of the most popular members of his
class.

Anderson played on the scrubs his Freshman year and then was one of the consistent and hardy players on the
Varsity his last three years. Six feet two inches tall and built up to suit, he held the right and
left tackle positions to suit the taste of Bill Fetzer, under whom he was trained as a fighting Wildcat. Good
steady-playing tackles were always the articles that Davidson stood in need. This tall and rangy lad, while not so heavy
as many that he bucked up against in the line, more than held his own in every game that he
played. The annual for 1915, the year of his graduation said that he had plenty of fight and that the
longer he played the stronger he got. He could be depended to do his share of the line attack and
defense every time. An unfortunate accident in the shape of a broken ankle kept him out of the two last
games of the ’13 season but he came back stronger than ever the next two years. At a game played
in Charlotte, The Observer said of him, “The big tackle Anderson was a tower of strength in the line.”

Anderson developed into a track star during his sojourn at Davidson and in one of the meets during his last
year was the high point man of the team. In the meet with the University of South Carolina, he won
the discus throw, hammer throw, shot put, tied the high jump and was second in several other places. He was
elected President of the Sophomore class and held several other trustworthy positions among them being a member of the Executive
Committee of the Athletic Association, Class Historian, Vice-President “D” club, and a member of the Gryphon Club. He belonged to
the Beta Theta Phi fraternity. He made many friends on the campus and in the classrooms, while his genial personality
made him popular wherever he appeared. He was also elected manager of the Varsity track team.

Louis was one of the first volunteers for service overseas and served with distinction throughout the time that the United
States held the Boche line back from the fields of France. At the present time he is an automobile salesman
in Anderson, S. C., “the old home town.”

Two infallible signs of Spring are horseshoes and baseball. The first of these, begun many days ago, is now on
the wane and the second is rapidly superseding it. Varsity, class, and bush-league are equally prominent. But the Varsity is
leaving this week for a foreign invasion, and naturally the field is left open for the class teams.

Red and Black Aggregation Avenges Defeat on Cinders

holding the long end of an 8 to 2 score. Clemson was unable to overcome a lead gained by the
Red and Black nine in the first four innings. In the eighth period, the Tigers rallied and shoved across one
run, but were never able to make the tying counter. Captain Pat Crawford started the ball rolling for the Wildcats
in the first inning, when he slammed a long fly over the centerfielder’s head and made a complete circle of
the bases. His home run was the only hit for that inning. Covington’s single in the second frame was ineffective,
his teammates allowing

THE PASSING OF BILL MAUZE.

With the exodus of the class of '23, there will pass from Davidson a man whose shadow has been as
far-reaching in its extent as that of any man in his class. What other member of the class of '23
has attained the altitude of Bill Mauze? Yet not only in inches does Bill tower head and shoulders above the
mere men of his class, but as a man of the campus, as a student, and as a sport writer,
he has become prominent. From the moment Bill hit the campus, a web-footed freshman, and was subjected to the indignity
of having to balance a fresh cap on his stately head, he has been wholeheartedly in support of the Davidsonian.
During the year of his freshmanship, he was general utility man, doing anything, and doing it well. From the start,
however, he showed a predilection toward athletic reporting, and manifested the greatest zeal and skill when instructed to report for
the sporting columns. In acknowledgment of his ability as a reporter, he was elected to membership in the Reporter’s Club.
During his sophomore year, he busied himself chiefly with writing up ball games ofthe foot, basket, and base. Scarce a
varsity game could be played without Bill’s presence as a reporter. The grass along the sidelines was kept in continual
subjection, by reason of the ever presence of Bill’s number elevens. Embarking upon his Junior year, he became the athletic
editor’s right-hand man, and became recognized as one to be relied upon, on every athletic occasion. During this year he
was awarded the Golden Quill in recognition of his work, from the standpoint of quality, as well as of quantity.
Later in the year he was initiated into the Delta Pi Kappa journalistic fraternity. Not content with these achievements of
the pen, he slew yet another giant, for after the Davidsonian staff appointments for the following year, Bill found himself
Athletic Editor. Under his enterprising hegemony this year, the athletic department of the Davidsonian has been unusually interesting and full
of sporting information and dope. The athletic write-ups have been exceptionally vigorous and up to date, and though all games
have not come out precisely as doped to come out, Bill has certainly done as much toward winning our victories
as the average wearer of the D. One of the livest strands of the “livest wire on the Hill” this
year, has been the column headed “Bill’s Bull.” Whether this bull was on football, basketball, baseball, or track, it was
ever entertaining and enlightening and Bill’s own. Bill’s line was unique. (Editor’s Note—Bill, we are sorry to see you preparing
to leave us. We thank you for what you have contributed to the Davidsonian and to the history and tradition
of Davidson College, and we know that your name has a sure place in one of those niches in the
hall of journalistic fame, in the archives of our college. Wherever you go, and whatever you do, here’s good luck
to you, Bill! We wish you success and we feel confident that you will get it for “the pen is
mightier than the sword.”)

Davidson filled the bases when Richards walked and McKay and Crawford each netted a single. The Tiger southpaw tightened up,
however, and closed out the allotted three men without permitting a score. Coach Currie’s cohorts registered one hit in each
of the two innings following, but “Alabam” Davis seemed to have the situation pretty well in hand, and Davidson had
no further opportunity to score. In the final three periods of the game, Wildcat batters were set down in regular
order by the Palmetto State southpaw. The Tigers rallied in the eighth and threatened to tie the score. Three costly
errors by the visitors helped Clemson to fill the bases and score one run. Bascomb Sorrels fanned one man and
his field took care of the other two, however, and the Tigers’ last chance was gone. It was easy to
set down three in quick succession in the last inning. On the mound, two southpaws opposed each other. The score
card gives Sorrels the better record, for the Wildcat hurler allowed only 4 hits, and kept them scattered, while nine
South Carolinians whiffed the air in a vain attempt to find Bascomb’s curves. “Lefty” Davis, another left-hander, in spite of
permitting eight hits, pitched stellar ball in the pinches. Only in the fourth inning did he weaken and allow the
decisive tallies. Captain Pat Crawford stepped up into his old hitting form by swatting the pill for two good hits,
one of them the clean homer which got the jump on Clemson. A change in Davidson’s line-up was necessary in
this game on account of the ruling against Freshmen. The Alford brothers were thus jerked from their regular posts at
left field and short. Mickey McKay filled Sion’s place well at infield position, while Boushee was used in the outfield.

WOFFORD GAME
The Wildcat diamond squad invaded the Palmetto state last week, opening with the Wofford Terriers at Spartanburg on Wednesday in
an exhibition which proved to be a slugfest in favor of the charges of Rip Major, by a tally of
10 to 4. Both clubs hit the old-apple rather hard and often, with Wofford touching McLaughlin, Wildcat fresh hurler, for
fourteen safeties while the Red and Black warriors faced a lucky moundsman in the person of Harold Murph, the Neally
Hunter of Wofforddom. The little moundsman yielded eight hits to the sticks of Richards, Crawford, Brice, Covington, and Frank Alford.
Other Wildcats were unable to solve his hooks and curves. The following tells the tale:
