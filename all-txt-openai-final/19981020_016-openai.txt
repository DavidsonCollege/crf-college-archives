**Defense dominates as Cats improve to 4-2**

With so many important starters returning this season, the Davidson defense was expected to be solid. Awesome, not solid, is
the only word to describe their performance so far. After Saturday’s action, the Cats defense ranked 3rd nationally in team
total defense as they have yielded an average of only 240.5 yards a game. They currently rank 2nd in team
scoring defense as opponents are averaging only 11.5 points a contest. Only Western Illinois, allowing 9.7 points a game, are
better than the Cats in Division I-AA.

Senior safety Cliff Henry and junior cornerback Donnie Johnson head up an outstanding secondary which leads the nation with 15
interceptions. Johnson, with five interceptions, is tied for the national lead. In turn, the defense’s strong performance has allowed the
offense to often start with excellent field position.

Before this season, the offense switched to a new formation. At first, there was some concern on how successful it
would be. After a shaky start, the offense has also proved to be very potent. Senior quarterback Tommy Dugan is
also among Division I-AA leaders as he ranks 21st in points per game. The result of such a balance resulted
in two dominating performances over the past two weeks.

In the first contest, Davidson beat up on archrival Washington & Lee, 29-7. The Cats piled up 247 net rushing
yards against the Generals. Davidson was led by Tommy Dugan who rushed for 68 yards on 16 carries. Senior Brian
Kern added 50 more yards on just six carries. Freshman Ryan Pagan continued to impress as he averaged 9.7 yards
per attempt. On the passing end, Dugan completed 8 of 19 passes for 111 yards and one touchdown.

After being forced to punt on their first two series in the first quarter, Cliff Henry made the first big
play of the game. Henry made a diving interception on third down deep in the Generals' own territory. Three plays
and fifty seconds later, the Cats were up 7-0. The big play came on first and ten from the W&L
27. Dugan handed the ball off to Kern who took it all the way to the 9. Eric Ferguson then
carried twice, scoring from the 2 on second and goal.

Against Washington & Lee, Davidson’s special teams continued to excel. After Dugan put the Cats up by 13 with an
impressive 12-yard run, the Cats lined up for what looked like a typical extra point. Instead, the ball was snapped
to Dugan, who ran it in for a two-point conversion. In the third quarter, the special teams were at it
again as senior Wes Jones broke through the line to block a punt by the Generals. The ball was deflected
to senior defensive end Ben Spivey who ran the ball all the way to the W&L 23. Up 15-0, and
having such good field position, the Cats were set for the kill. After the Generals held the Cats to one
yard, Dugan, unable to find an open receiver, was able to run sixteen yards for another Davidson first down. Two
plays later, Dugan scored his second touchdown of the game. In the fourth quarter, Dugan threw a great pass to
Roland Williams, who split the defenders, and scored. The play went 27 yards, and the Cats were up 29-7. Williams
had a good game as he had three catches for 48 yards.

On the defensive end, both Bo Henderson and Freeman Belser continued their excellent sophomore campaigns. Both had twelve tackles. Henderson
was especially impressive as he had two sacks. Linebackers Wes Thornton and Sam Fraundorf also played well as they had
seven tackles apiece. One last note, during the game, senior kicker Brian Langley set a new Davidson record as he
connected on his 36th consecutive extra point.

Davidson used a very balanced offensive attack to defeat Methodist 26-0. Once again, all cylinders were clicking as offense, defense,
and special teams all clicked. Dugan had one of his best days passing going 14-of-25 for 142 yards. Dugan added
43 rushing yards. Brian Kern had his second strong game in a row as he carried the ball six times
for 56 yards. Eric Ferguson added 64 yards as he continues to climb up Davidson’s all-time rushing chart.

The Davidson Men’s and Women’s Swimming and Diving Team traveled to William and Mary College this past weekend to take
on the host team as well as Virginia Tech in the Wildcats’ first meet of the season. In a meet
that centered mainly around the in-state rivalry between William & Mary and VT, Davidson was unfortunately relegated to the role
of “third wheel.” However, despite the fact the ‘Cats lost the meet overall, several Davidson swimmers and divers enjoyed solid
performances. Against Virginia Tech, the women’s team lost by a score of 175 points to 77 points; however, individual standouts
included Freshman Starr Daniell of Lithonia, Ga. who took first place in the 200-meter butterfly. Also, junior Beth Wilson earned
2nd place in the 200-meter breaststroke with a time of 2:32.86, while senior Captain Kathleen Paffenroth took second place in
the 200-meter butterfly. Despite these solid performances, Virginia Tech was

The Lady Wildcats’ 3-0 win over Southern Conference Chattanooga on Sunday was a key confidence booster as Davidson looks ahead
to the Southern Conference Tournament which begins on November 3rd. Prior to the game, Davidson (6-10, 4-3) was in the
midst of a five-game losing streak dating back to their 2-0 loss to the University of Richmond on October 3rd.

For the first 70 minutes of play, Chattanooga play was not reflective of their 1 and 15 overall record and
their 0 and 7 conference standing. The Lady Mocs held Davidson scoreless until the 71st minute when junior Ginny Dye
scored on a give and go assisted by fellow junior Leila Wormuth. The goal was Dye’s fourth of the season
and 19th of her career. 28 seconds later it was deja vu.Still able to pull out a victory due largely
to their dominating performances in both the 200 and 500 meter freestyle events where they swept 1st through 3rd places.
Also included in the point totals are the diving events. Wildcat divers, sophomore Christa Conner and freshman Elizabeth Nugent, finished
3rd and 6th respectively in the one-meter events. The men’s team fell to Virginia Tech by nearly an identical score
as the women, 169.5 to 71.5. And, like the women’s team, had several solid individual showings but were unable to
triumph as a team. The ‘Cats 400 meter medley relay, swum by junior Terry Dolch, sophomore Kurt Hirsekorn, junior Scott
Harper, and senior Bill Paterson, took first place. Also, Hirsekorn, sophomore Matt West, and freshman Tom Murphy led the Wildcats
in a 1, 2, 3 sweep of the 200 meter breaststroke.

The women’s team enjoyed a much closer contest against William and Mary. Against the Georgia Bulldogs on October 9th, the
Wildcats fought hard but were clearly outmatched. Georgia dominated from the start, scoring three goals in the first half and
three in the second. Davidson’s lone score came off an own-goal by the Bulldogs at the 85-minute mark. Ultimately, the
‘Cats were outshot 29 to 2. After the Georgia game, Davidson’s schedule did not get any easier. Against powerhouse Clemson
University (10-3), the Wildcats were once again sent packing with a lopsided loss. Although the ‘Cats were able to contain
the Tigers for over 20 minutes, Clemson eventually broke the game open with goals in the 21st, 23rd, and 42nd
minutes. The second half was much of the same as Clemson added three more scores and, in the process, set
a school record for single-season assists (59). The Wildcats also fell to Elon 1 to 0 on October 16th.

Looking ahead, the Wildcats (6-10, 4-3) will face Wake at home this Wednesday evening at 7 pm. On Oct. 24th,
they will travel to conference rival East Tennessee State for a 3 pm game. They are the last two regular
season games, as the Wildcats gear up for the Southern Conference Tournament scheduled to begin on November 3rd. The exact
time and location of the first tournament game will be announced soon.

The men’s team didn’t fare as well against William and Mary, losing by over 70 points. Yet despite the team
loss, junior Scott Harper won the 200 meter individual medley with a time of 1:57:18, while junior Terry Dolch won
the 200 meter backstroke. The Wildcats have an inner-squad meet this Saturday at 11 AM.

Virginia Tech 175 points

Davidson’s defense continued to excel. For the second straight game, Cliff Henry picked off two passes. Donnie Johnson also had
two, tying him for the Division I-AA lead. Senior Rich Hale also had a pick as the Cats took the
national lead in interceptions. Henry’s first pick was especially crucial as he gave the Cats great field position on the
Methodist 39. Four plays later, Nate Hagerman scored his first touchdown of the year. After taking a 20-0 lead by
the end of the first quarter, the Cats cruised to a 26-0 victory. They outgained the Monarchs 347 yards to
227. The Cats' next game is Homecoming at Richardson Field. Game time is 2:00.

Andrew Holbrook, a junior, scored 4 goals in Davidson’s last 3 victories. Two of the goals came in the 2-1
