the piano ever since he was four years old. His father is Robert Casadesus, world-renowned pianist. After entering Paris Conservatory,
Jean Casadesus won many medals; the “premier medaille,” won at the early age of 10; “first medal in Solfege” at
11 years old; “Premier Prix de Piano” at 14, and later the Prix Diemer. Mr. Casadesus came to the United
States for the first time in 1940, not knowing a word of English, but within two weeks he could speak
it fluently. In 1946, he returned to Paris to study for a year, and then returned to this country. After
attending Lawrenceville Prep School in New Jersey, Mr. Casadesus entered Princeton University, only to remain there one term, due to
his time-taking musical studies. The concert star has kept on winning prizes and awards. He won first prize in serious
competition at Geneva, Switzerland, and also the Philadelphia Orchestra youth contest, playing under the direction of Eugene Ormandy. At 20,
Casadesus sees destined for greater merits.

“Senior Speaking” arose and became synonymous with it, traditions were celebrated together up until 1923, when the seniors got tired
of speaking and incorporated it into Homecoming, which has been observed annually to this date. “Senior Speaking” had been the
big event on the campus for many years. By February 22, 1893, the juniors had decided it was time for
them to be heard and declared that day “Junior Speaking.” All those applying for diplomas were required to deliver two
public orations—one in the junior year and at least one in the senior year. The last celebration of this event
of which a record has been found was in 1926.

The faculty at years ago was a generous group. Here is a quotation from the June, 1894, edition of the
Davidson Monthly: “The faculty have kindly given us one day of the year to be devoted to athletics...” However, the
students took that one day and made it the greatest event of the college up to that time. They named
it “Athletic Day” and set aside May 7, 1894, as the date for the first celebration. The Athletic Association, which
was organized at the beginning of that term, planned the program and saw to it that everything was executed without
a hitch. A large crowd gathered enthusiastically for this day. Both grandstands were jammed with spectators. Some of the events
and their records were: throwing the baseball 309 feet and four inches; 100-yard dash, 10 3-4 seconds; one-half-mile walk, 3
minutes and 14 seconds; throwing the hammer 87 feet; pole vault, 9 feet, 5 inches. The seniors won the relay
in four minutes and five seconds. The course was one mile around the campus tour relays. The juniors won the
tug of war.

bringing back distinguished alumni so they might see the plight in which the college found itself was a big success.
October 24, 1906, was the first observance of this day (a forerunner of Homecoming). The college at that time was
suffering from a lack of dormitory space and needed endowment. Traditions have always played a great part in making Davidson
the college it is today. It has been one of the main factors in building up and maintaining the "Davidson
Spirit," which is lauded over the country. It is our duty and responsibility to nourish and preserve our present traditions
for those who are destined to inherit the Davidson which we enjoy.

of a police force adequate to maintain international law. This education should be of particular interest to the students. Such
famous name bands as Willis Coggins and his woodwind sextet and Mouse Morgan and his band will make the recent
Tommy Dorsey concert seem like mere child's play. Accompanying these musical gems will be none other than those famous singers
Listerina Chandler and Bellowma Hodgins. It should not be overlooked that Hal Hanes and his Hill-Hillies will provide local color.
It has further been rumored that Mac Upchurch will be starred in a rough and tough wild west scene. Also,
that famous comedian of stage, screen, and radio, Randy Ensign, has assured this reporter that he will do his utmost
to enliven all parts of the production through personal appearances. Your reporter understood this to mean that he might therefore
be present in the quiz show which is to be presented by Macneil Upchurch as master of ceremonies. This quiz
show is positively guaranteed to make the members of the “It Pays To Be Ignorant” program all look like members
of Phi Beta Kappa. These are but merely a few of the items which will appear in the next production
Tuesday evening. From all indications, the production is one which all would profit from attending. Although still only relatively little
information upon which to base an opinion, the coming Carnegie and Ashmore, Incorporated production should prove to be one of
the most enjoyable and entertaining ones yet presented at Davidson College.

asked by members of the audience. Always a point was made of keeping the discussion within the understanding of non-musicians.
Phi Mu Alpha is proud to be able to offer programs of this type and wishes to present such instructional
and enjoyable programs to a much larger segment of the student body. For that reason, its programs are open to
the public, and it is hoped that more will take advantage of the opportunity of attending.

New Brothers Give Programs
Newly initiated brothers of Phi Mu Alpha have recently presented the fraternity with two very enjoyable programs in Chambers Auditorium.
The last of these was presented on Monday evening, March 7. Henry Bridges opened the first program with Alain’s “Suspended
Gardens” for organ and was followed by Sen Drymon who played the beautiful 1st movement of Beethoven's “Moonlight” sonata. Bill
Whitesides presented two Italian songs: “Vergin, Tutta Amor” by Durante, and “O Cessate di Piagarmi” by Scarlatti. Ken Johnson closed
this program with a religious number entitled “Hallelujah.” It was announced at the meeting of March 7 that henceforth programs
presented by Phi Mu Alpha will be open to the general public, and attendance at these by the student body
at large will be encouraged.
