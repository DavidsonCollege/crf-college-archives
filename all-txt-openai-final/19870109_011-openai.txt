**Davidson Wild ‘brats’ spoil UNCC game**

*Paula C. Brannon*

Editors’ note: This article appeared in the January 4 edition of Mecklenburg Neighbors and is reprinted with permission.

I am writing concerning the UNCC-Davidson game on Saturday night, Dec. 13. My fiancé got tickets for us to go to the game because we thought it was going to be a good game. It was a good game, all right, if you call the Davidson fans acting like a bunch of rude pigs a “good game.”

Now, I am not talking about all the fans in the Coliseum. Just a bunch sitting in the bleachers directly behind the Davidson end of the court. I will admit — there will always be insults traded at a game between two big rivals. I can take that in stride. Insults are not important. But what I cannot abide is when the fans start throwing trash onto the playing floor.

The Davidson fans did this several times and then only did it when the players were down at their end of the court. What if one of those players (including one of Davidson's) had stepped on a piece of that trash? They could have been badly hurt. Yet the Davidson fans were too ignorant to realize this. There is no call for that sort of behavior in any sport.

And that was not the end of it. They went one step further — they actually threw it at someone! It was half-time and a young lady had stepped out on the floor to do a baton-twirling act. She was very good and everyone seemed to be enjoying her. She was not doing anyone any harm, just minding her business. She was not even part of the game. And you know what? Some Davidson punk threw a plastic ball at her! Can you imagine that?

She was very lucky. Just as the ball would have hit her, she had to step out to catch her baton and the ball whizzed harmlessly by. But what if it had hit her? It was aimed at her legs but what if she had been hit in the face? She could have been seriously injured.

I have seen this trash throwing happen at many basketball games and even have seen a few players get hurt because of it. Yet the officials make no move to stop it. I know they can’t be everywhere at once; perhaps they could hire an extra official just for that purpose or give the responsibility to one of the kids who usually wipes the floor. I think that the officials should make it a technical foul the first time a piece of trash is thrown on the floor and the second time, stop the game completely, make everyone go home, and declare that there is no winner of the game.

Perhaps when fans get tired of being blamed for a forfeited game and some of the students get blackballed at school for throwing trash on the floor then we will see an end to this childish and ignorant behavior. As guests, I don’t think Davidson behaved very well and, if I were UNCC, I would refuse to play them until their fans could act like the grown-ups they are supposed to be. But then again, what do you expect from a bunch of spoiled, rich brats who cannot take losing gracefully?

**Boesky scandal inspires improvement of ethics**

*Tim Brown*

Ivan Boesky is a greedy green snake who smiles sinister smiles, slithers around Wall Street, and buys new layers of snazzy skin at Brooks Brothers. Boesky smiles continuously — during the good times and during the not-so-good times. During the good times, Boesky thrived as a double-dealing financier and sneakily stuck his tongue out at the Securities Exchange Commission, which regularly checks up on financiers’ business ethics.

Recently, the SEC has focused its investigative microscope on Boesky’s crooked business dealings. Now, during the not-so-good times, Boesky swallows his tongue and pleads to the SEC: Please don’t tread on me and my $400 suit.

Boesky’s official business title is hard to pronounce and is fun to slide into cocktail-party conversations: arbitrageur. An arbitrageur exploits price discrepancies between different markets. Let me explain with an example. When a corporate raider offers to buy a company at a certain price, the target company’s stocks normally rise to a value near the price offered by the corpo-rate raider. (The price offered by the corporate raider is usually 30 to 40 percent over the current market price of the company.) Before the deal goes through, the arbitrageur quickly buys up the stocks of the target company. The price the arbitrageur pays for the target company’s stocks is above the stocks’ current market price, but is below the price the corporate raider offered to pay for the company. If the deal does go through — if the corporate raider does purchase the company — the arbitrageur makes substantial profits, buys a super-fancy sports car, and eats at the finer restaurants. But if for some reason the corporate raider does not purchase the company, the arbitrageur loses big bucks, drives his soiled station wagon with soiled pride, and eats at Hardee’s.

An arbitrageur can obtain legally information about up-and-coming corporate raids from public sources, whose collective job it is to disclose such information to the public; or an arbitrageur can obtain illegally nonpublic information from privileged sources, who are not supposed to disclose such information to the public. Boesky procured nonpublic information from the privileged source Dennis Levine, an investment banker for the investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert. Dennis Levine identified for Boesky what companies were going to be targeted by corporate raiders, enabling Boesky to make over $50 million in illegal profits on riskless takeover deals.

So far, the Boesky scandal has brought about a surprise and has sparked optimism. Surprisingly, Boesky’s dealings have called into question the dealings of corporate raiders but not those of arbitrageurs. Many argue passionately that corporate raiders don’t care about the target company’s employees who lose their jobs during takeover attempts, that corporate raiders care only about their own profits. Corporate raiders respond to these impassioned arguments with calculated coolness, and rationalize that corporate takeovers inspire target companies to make their management and production systems more efficient. A corporate raider at Harry’s Bar on Wall Street sipped martinis and allowed them to speak the truth: The Boesky scandal is not going to frighten unethical corporate raiders up to higher levels of ethics. “It’s like knowing someone with cancer. You feel it for a while. But you say to yourself, ‘Hey, it’s not me,’ and you go on.”

Many others, such as Richard Coles, a psychiatrist at the Harvard Business School, and Stan Schultz, a social historian at the University of Wisconsin, predict optimistically that the Boesky scandal will give an added boost to business ethics courses in schools of supposed “higher” learning. This is a definite possibility as long as Boesky does not go on a college-lecture series. Last year Boesky was the commencement speaker at the School of Business Administration of the University of California. At the end of his speech, he deposited evil seeds in the students’ fertile minds: “Greed is all right, by the way. I want you to know that. I think greed is healthy. You can be greedy and still feel good about yourself.” H’mmmm.

After being caught red-handed by the SEC, Boesky has proven himself as crafty a bargainer as he is an arbitrageur. Boesky has made a deal with the SEC. He will pay $100 million in penalties (the largest penalty ever - but only half of his net worth), will quit Wall Street by April 1, 1988 (until that time he will be free to make money on Wall Street to pay for his penalty, and perhaps will deliver speeches and write a book about his double-dealings), and will plead guilty to only one count of criminal activity. The SEC reports that Boesky’s guilty plea “could subject him to a possible prison sentence.” Grammarians will be sure to make note of the weasel words “could” and “possible.” If the gods do deliver justice and Boesky is found guilty, how should he be incarcerated? Finally — ha, ha, ha — we get to the really fun part that calls for delightful fiendishness and vigorous imagining. Let’s lock him in a glass cage, feed him Hardee's greaseburgers and water, and allow angry investors and snake-haters to frighten him up into a bedspring by tapping on the glass cage incessantly and irregularly.
