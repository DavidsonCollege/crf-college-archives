**Food service director talks about year ahead**

Mr. Carleton Pritchard is the head of the new College Dining Service. He comes to Davidson from the University of
Virginia, where he also headed the dining service. The following quotations are excerpted from an interview with the Davidsonian on
8 September.

**DAVIDSONIAN:** How long were you at the University of Virginia?

**PRITCHARD:** About seven years, and before that about eight years at the University of Tennessee—Knoxville.

**DAVIDSONIAN:** Do you think this is a fair analogy: that the head of a college dining service is something like
a restaurant owner in that he sets the menu, and he sets the style and atmosphere where he serves the
food?

**PRITCHARD:** You could say that. A director of a college food service is a little different from a regular restaurant
owner. Basically, the reason I’m here is to assure the College and the students that the students get nutritious meals.
And meals that contribute to their welfare at the College. I like to think that the food service is part
of the whole growing experience at college. Therefore, I think that the food should be interesting to complement your experience
at college so that it’s not just there, so that it’s part of the whole living, growing experience.

**DAVIDSONIAN:** How do you keep the food interesting?

**PRITCHARD:** I’d say with special events, such as international dinners.

**DAVIDSONIAN:** What other kinds of special events do you have planned?

**PRITCHARD:** Well, are you asking me to give away all my secrets now? I think it’s necessary for me to
take a look at the students. I think the students need to react to what we can do, too.

**DAVIDSONIAN:** What social activities will there be for the first term?

**PRITCHARD:** Well, what we’re interested in doing is getting the thing started right. We don’t want to start a whole
bunch of things right off the bat. We’re not going to get a whole lot of pizzazz the first term.
I think we need to react to one another, and if I think that you need something, I’ll say, ‘Well,
what would you like?’

**DAVIDSONIAN:** Will you be on the floor at mealtimes?

**PRITCHARD:** I have been every meal so far! I guess I’ll have to continue. Yes.

**DAVIDSONIAN:** What makes yours a top-notch service?

**PRITCHARD:** The thing that makes any food service successful is a certain amount of dedication to the idea behind the
food service and the college. My strongest desire is to make us the best food service in the country.

**DAVIDSONIAN:** Do you plan to increase the number of students eating at the Commons? Or do you plan on staying
the same size?

**PRITCHARD:** I think that depends on Patterson Court. I think that if Patterson Court stays as a vibrant force, then
the present proportion is about right.

**DAVIDSONIAN:** Do you think Patterson Court will remain strong?

**PRITCHARD:** I think it is a good idea.

**The new Commons**

Davidson’s $3.6 million entry into food service continued from page 1

Jack Caldwell, who came here from the Radisson Hotel, helps generate student interest. Caldwell’s bakery produces such delicacies as chocolate
éclairs, cream puffs, and the cakes for this year’s cake race. Mr. Pritchard also plans several special events at the
Commons, depending on student reactions and suggestions. The Commons will have a make-your-own-sundae night every other week. The Dining Service
is preparing special international meals once a month, featuring Chinese and Italian foods the first few months. Mr. Pritchard said
he would break in his ideas for special events slowly because “it’s necessary for me to take a look at
the students and what they want to do.” He also expects that “it will take about a month to get
things squared away.” Mr. Pritchard comes to Davidson from the...University of Virginia where he ran many special events, such as
monthly zodiac birthday parties; Oktoberfests, Spring Flings, and Food Service Olympics. He said, “everything we did was a success.” The
Dining Service has an almost completely new staff of 40 professional employees working to get the program going. Pritchard said
he retained only the “three very best” workers from the old ARA service. Senior Eric Sorensen manages the 30 work-study
and 20 high school students who also work for the Dining Service. The Commons’ full 19-meal dining plan costs $1090
per year, slightly more than most Patterson Court (PC) houses (see table on p. 5). The College has not yet
finished paying for the Commons, so the final bill is undetermined, but the original cost estimate was $3.6 million, according
to Comptroller Robert Davidson. The Dining Service’s operational budget comes only from student board bills, income from catering, and walk-in
sales. Walk-in customers pay $3.10 for dinner, $2.75 for lunch, and $2.25 for breakfast. Saturday dinner is $4.50 and Sunday
dinner’s price is undetermined. All 360 freshmen (and 200 upperclassmen) are presently eating at the Commons regularly. Mr. Pritchard said
he was not sure if the number of students eating at the Commons would grow. “I think that depends on
Patterson Court. I think if Patterson Court stays as a vibrant force on campus the proportion is about right.” He
added, “I think Patterson Court is a good idea.” Dean of Students Will Terry thinks it’s too early to tell
what permanent effect the Commons will have on the rest of Patterson Court. He speculated that there are three possible
effects, all of which would help court houses. First, “fewer people will be joining houses to escape poor eating.” The
people joining court houses “will be looking for something additional socially.” Dean Terry expects that because “people have used Patterson
Court houses as troughs without any commitment to the people or the house” in the past, having only dedicated members
will be a benefit. Second, Dean Terry thinks the fraternities will benefit because the contrast of the popular Commons will
accent the importance of their fraternal atmosphere. Finally, Dean Terry said “The Commons is going to force all the houses
on the court to run a better operation in terms of management and finance.” He added, “I think the College
has an obligation to help the houses operate better in cost accounting, purchasing jointly, and strengthening the Patterson Court Council
(PCC).” He predicts the houses “will have to surrender some autonomy to survive.” Secretary Keith Hearle said the Commons “will
lead to the houses improving food quality or they are going to lose students.” PCC President Joni Seehorn said that
in addition, PC house members need to work on the appearance of their houses, and to maintain an attitude of
caring about their houses. She said one of the main advantages of the Patterson Court is “a real shy sophomore
can go in and meet everyone in the house.” Joni said the PCC hopes to arrange to buy food in
cooperation with the Commons. She said the PCC will meet informally with Mr. Pritchard early in the term to introduce
themselves and to discuss cooperative buying.
