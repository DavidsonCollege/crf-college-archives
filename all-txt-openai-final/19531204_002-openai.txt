**Present Intercollegiate Competition Spelling Disaster For Davidson**

Last Wednesday night’s debacle at Johnston Gymnasium was the thirty-first consecutive major sport defeat suffered by Davidson’s basketball, baseball, and
football teams. The last time any of these teams won a contest was when the basketball team defeated The Citadel
early this year—during the 1952-53 season. We don’t desire the role of prophet of doom, but we honestly fear that
the end of this string of losses may not be in sight.

No one would be so foolish or unjust as to take to task the players or coaches for this unimpressive
showing. We are not just paying lip-service to them, but honestly believe that they have done and are doing their
best in intercollegiate competition. Rather than condemnation, they deserve the highest praise for continuing to hustle and to put out
when the cards are usually stacked against them.

We could go on and on berating fortune, the alumni, or the college faculty and administration for failing to supply
Davidson with sufficient athletic material to make even a passable showing in the won-lost column, where we haven’t even scratched
for nearly a year. In a way, a towering rage seems quite appropriate for the occasion. It would be tempting
to try to picture our athletes as a breed of long-suffering but mute heroes who steadily go down to defeat
in a losing cause that grows steadily worse through the years with no surcease in sight. It might be appropriate
to point out that we are well on the road to being the laughing stock of collegiate athletics, gaining notoriety
by consistently losing, where we have not recently been able to gain any through winning.

Word of the Davidson disaster is spreading, not just in the South, but all across the country, from Cincinnati, and
even from California we have heard the word filtering back. We might point out to certain of the faculty, administration,
and student body that the outbursts in chapel might have some relation to the fact that we never have much
to cheer about anywhere else. Certainly, we would not forget the coaching staff. Perhaps theirs is the least enviable lot
of all. They are doomed to failure in a profession that doesn’t take into consideration how you played the game,
but only if you won or lost. And on and on we could go.

So the question is asked, as many outsiders and alumni ask it, “What’s wrong with Davidson?” The answer may not
be as simple as we think, but it is certainly not as obscure as some who ponder the problem would
have us believe. The whole problem centers on the fact that our objectives in athletics are at the furthermost extremes
of incompatibility. We persist in spending about half the money that our lowliest competitors spend to bring athletes to Davidson
because we still like to think we're simon pure; we insist that the athletes we bring here meet the same
standards that all other students have to meet in order to stay in school, and considerably higher standards in order
to be eligible for varsity competition; we then schedule teams from schools with larger student bodies, generally lower academic standards,
not to mention much greater subsidization programs, because we are afraid of “lowering ourselves” by doing otherwise—there being the opinion
that it is more honorable to lose to superior numbers than gain an even break at one’s own level; finally,
we hope, and a vain hope it is, that though handicapped by overwhelming odds our boys will show that venerable
old Davidson spirit, and bring home the bacon as often as not.

This is far-fetched optimism at the extreme. We simply cannot do all these things in this day and time in
the field of intercollegiate athletics. We are trying to do them, and have been for a number of years. The
intercollegiate record of these years, which shows our stock steadily falling, is ample proof of our utter failure and desolation.
We have long since struck the depths and are now in the process of exploring them.

There are several ways out of our present quandary. Two years ago Bill White, in a very prophetic and thought-provoking
editorial, said in substance that we were in a dilemma, and that what we needed was strong leadership to put
us on one of the possible roads leading out. None of the obvious solutions were or are without drawbacks, but
what could be more intolerable than our present position? There are about three basic courses possible: We could logically follow
up the program of subsidization we have only half begun, spend more money, which could be gotten, and continue the
present scheduling of schools with some hope of reasonable success; or we could drop the sports that have become commercialized
elsewhere altogether; or we could continue or reduce our present athletic budget and drop into a league where we would
have at least a prayer.

It is plain and simple cruelty, psychological if not physical, to continually send young men out to certain defeat on
the field of play. It kills something in them and in their followers.

**"WHAT'S THIS"**

Hello... How’ve you been? Sorry we missed you. Hi, I’d like to briefly say a few words about what seems
to be...

**McCarthy Hits New Depths In Speech Blasting Truman**

Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin has made an important and perhaps momentous move this week. And we as students might
do well to turn away from our books and other provincial concerns long enough to look at this situation in
which America’s most notorious demagogue has finally called for a showdown. It seems that we are about to find out
who represents the Republican party to the American people today. Will it be Eisenhower, the President of the U.S. and
titular leader of the Republican party, or the man who has caused people all over the free world to lose
respect for America, the Senator from Wisconsin?

When Senator McCarthy called yesterday for a mass approval by the American people of his methods and efforts in fighting
communism—and also of dictating foreign policy to the Administration—he finally brought on a situation which, it seems, must result in
some sort of showdown. Although McCarthy's request for letters and wires to President Eisenhower approving the Senator's methods may not
end in a decisive victory or defeat for either one, it seems now that the President must—to preserve any of
his present prestige—take a firm stand on McCarthy’s tactics and efforts to make his aims and methods the standard of
the Republican party.

**What Concern to Student?**

At this point, the reader may wonder what concern this situation is to him. What difference does another political squabble
make to him when he’s got more important things to worry about, such as History 13 or this weekend's plans?
The fact of the matter is that this isn’t just another political squabble. The issues at stake are much more
important than they would be in just another political dispute, and if the man discussed here ever becomes a real
power in America we may all have to pay the consequences for our folly in letting him gain such a
position.

Why is this man McCarthy so important, and so dangerous to America today? It is my contention that he represents
a threat to certain principles which are vital and dear to this country—to the right of free thought and expression,
to the right of fair trial, to honesty and integrity in political affairs, and even common human decency.

**Fallacy in Reasoning**

But, it is said, isn't McCarthy against communism, and isn’t communism bad? Both of these statements are true—and that line
of reasoning is exactly the one Senator McCarthy would like to have everyone follow. But did it ever occur to
any of McCarthy’s fans that this is the same thing as saying, for instance, that Mr. Blank is against sin,
and isn’t sin bad? The obvious inference from these two arguments is that anybody who opposes Senator McCarthy—or Mr. Blank—must
be for communism—or for sin. It seems hardly ever to occur to the members of the McCarthy fan club that
it is not the Senator's avowed aims that his opponents are attacking, but rather his methods, which we have seen
him use time and time again—the big smear, the headlines, and then the fadeaway, when finally it appears that the
Senator had accused a man without concrete evidence.

The charges which can be made against McCarthy merely from his last speech are many, but a few illustrations will
serve to show some of his other mean methods. One of the most flagrant distortions of the truth and the
record ever made by any demagogue can be seen in the concluding paragraph of his speech last week: “Let me
remind you in conclusion that when the smoke-screen of false political righteousness is raised against McCarthyism by Harry Truman or
anyone else singing in his choir of deceit, that he, Truman, stands on his record as an individual and as
a President. He promoted Harry Dexter White, Russian spy. He fired Douglas MacArthur, one of the greatest living Americans.”

The implication is clearly that Truman’s record is summed up in that he promoted a Russian spy and fired one
of the greatest living Americans. From this, it is difficult to infer anything else except that Truman worked in the
interests of the communists. In this sordid attack on Truman's loyalty, no mention whatsoever is made of the very effective
and important Truman Doctrine for the containment of communism, the Marshall Plan for European recovery, or the Point Four program
for technical assistance to underdeveloped countries—all of which dealt a body blow to Russian imperialistic interests.

**Guilt by Association**

Guilt by association is another of McCarthy's favorite methods. In his attempt to tie up American casualties in America to
the doings of the communists in America, he mentions the known communists, Alger Hiss and Harry Dexter White, in the
same breath as former Secretary of State Dean Acheson, who, although he may have made mistakes and had shortcomings, can
on the basis of the overall record hardly be considered a communist or even a communist sympathizer. Yet McCarthy would
quite obviously have us believe that Acheson, who held what is probably the second highest governmental position in the land,
aided and abetted the communists.

The unbelievably low depths to which this man will stoop can be seen in the opening passage of the speech
being discussed. McCarthy states that Truman's definition of McCarthyism “was identical, word for word, comma for comma, with the definitions
adopted by the Communist Daily Worker which originated the term. Yesterday, the National Committee of the Communist party issued a
statement condemning Attorney General Brownell and lauding Truman for his attack on ‘McCarthyism.’”

**Truman Not Communist**

Now, I do not have much use either for some of our former President’s ways but I do not believe
that the overall record shows that Harry Truman was or is now a communist or a fellow traveler, and I
do not think many Americans believe that. But what other inference can you make from McCarthy’s statement? There is much
more from the record that could be cited to show the low plane on which McCarthy operates, but I think
these examples suffice.

**Kindergarten Ku Klux Klan**

The following is an excerpt from The Cavalier at the University of Virginia where a fight is now being made
to establish a Students for America organization:

The following editorial originally appeared in the Minnesota Daily; it is reprinted here because we feel that it is indicative
of the current trend in this country towards mass conformity, McCarthyism, and away from many of the American concepts of
individual liberty. It is even more significant because there is a group of students here—largely first-year men—who desire to establish
a chapter of Students for America at this University. The avowed purpose of three self-appointed vigilantes is to search out
and expose any leftists, Marxists, Communists, fellow-travelers, etc., among the students and faculty of the University. These first-year men are
to take it upon themselves to determine who is and who is not “un-American” through their own junior-grade imitation of
McCarthyism. We feel that this sort of kindergarten Ku Klux Klan is out of...Place at this University. Somewhere in our
high schools, this year’s freshmen and high school students in the classes are informed, or not informed at all, about
the basic concepts of our way of life. Proof of this comes in a poll Purdue University recently took of
the high school age group. The results are startling. For instance:

- Fifty-eight per cent of the high school students polled think police are justified in giving a man the third
degree to make him talk.
- Only 45% said newspapers should be permitted to print the news freely except for military secrets.
- Thirty-three per cent said that persons who refuse to testify against themselves should either be made to talk or
be severely punished.
- Twenty-six per cent believe that police should be allowed to search a person or his home without a warrant.

It’s not a healthy situation to have young people rejecting constitutional guarantees of freedom at a time when these liberties
are threatened by demagogues and dictators. Freshmen who hold these beliefs should examine them carefully during their next four years.
We hope that during your intellectual and social development here you will come to be an ardent defender of the
civil liberties some of you now disapprove.

OFF-MOORINGS: FRIDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1953

The Davidson Atmosphere Not Ruin of An Outdated Morality

We knew by Tuesday that Jim Moore, married man, would be unable to write for this week’s paper; with this
depressing prospect in mind, we began to scout about the campus looking for a topic for the week. Stopping in
at one of the administrative offices we asked the gentleman for a suggestion. With his reply, “What do you feel
like tearing up,” we got our lead. Paper upon paper, speech upon speech this year has followed the policy of
“tear this apart,” “Rip that to pieces,” etc., until we have come to the point on the whole that the
Free Lance seemed to reach last year: The whole school is a crate of tom-foolery anyway.

Sometime ago in chapel a well-known statesman visiting Davidson made the statement that corruption in government was the exception, else
it would not be billed as top news. Without agreeing or disagreeing with his statement as to national scope, we
would like to try to apply it to the Davidson scene as a fact. It is the chapel conduct, the
missing library books, the dormitory noisemakers, the freshman disregarding his rules that draw the attention here at Davidson, whereas behind
the scenes those seven hundred or so regular boys, neither notable nor notorious, go about their daily business with a
general underlying regard for most of those about them.

Were two hundred library books missing at the end of last year? The boys responsible should have been reprimanded. But
what of the thousands of books properly checked out and in by boys who naturally work in accord with their
privilege in having the open stack system? These boys surely build greatly upon a system which the few who disregard
it would tear down.

There was much talk of gross dishonesty on the part of College Union coffee drinkers before the snack bar was
set up. There is no doubt that under a system of personal honor such as exists here at Davidson all
coffee should have been paid for, yet those eighty per cent who took the honor system at its worth and
paid out of pure habit never received praise. Some would say that they were only doing what was expected of
them, and that they therefore deserve no praise. It would seem to us that doing one’s duty merits high praise,
especially when that action is unsupervised save by one’s own conscience.

Recently there was a boy in a long line in front of the College Union reception desk. He stood there
for ten minutes waiting his turn to speak to the attendant. When he was recognized, he handed in sixty cents
that he had found on one of the chairs. Would this money ever reach its owner? Probably not! That was
not what was important to the boy who handed it in. Something bigger than himself, perhaps an impersonal version of
the Golden Rule, dwelt inside him, telling him that no matter whose money it was, he would return it to
the proper place, exactly as he would expect someone to do for him.

It is interesting to stay in one’s room studying late into the night, for one can hear in the noises
in the hall a contrast of which the spectacular side is usually the only one editorialized. At intervals the storm
troopers invade the quietness with their wild tales of card games or concubines, but at other times, by far the
more numerous, a quiet step is heard outside the door, the step of a boy who knows that others are
asleep, and that he too will soon be getting needed rest. He carries within him a realization that he is
a gregarious being, responsible not for his own welfare alone, but for that of those around him.

Before the leaves fall, when the freshmen enter their new school, there is seen again, even in these earliest embryo
Davidsonians, a spirit not deplorable, but for the most part eager to settle into the track (not rut) and learn
the ways of the school. Do freshmen disobey their rules? For the most part delinquency is left to a very
few, and the freshmen as a whole show an attitude of willingness to comply with the same training offered to
those who have gone before them. Whether the training is proper or just is not for discussion here. It is
complied with because freshmen like a smooth running college life, and tradition has set for them what it feels to
be the proper start.

The most talked about subject so far this college year has been the chapel conduct. Davidsonian articles have pictured the
student in extremes from a contemptible barbarian or infant needing a diaper and baby carriage to be happy, to a
freedom loving and righteous man who seeks in riotous chapel conduct to tear down a system of forced labor. Five
or ten men could possibly fit into each category, but by far the most students are usually attentive to those
to whom they feel they should show respect without reserve, and fun loving with those who can take it. There
have been recent cases of disrespect in hoots, guffaws, or barking dogs, but in these cases it was an individual,
not the Davidson students as a whole that was guilty.

On and on one could go with ease in citing examples of the mature attitude of the Davidson student; the
congenial atmosphere of the campus, the wonderful willingness to help the other fellow, the unaffected yet unsarcastic air of student
groups in general. Always there are those who disregard others completely; always in any human instrument such as Davidson College,
imperfect and unfinished, there are faults in framework, administration and tradition. But would one destroy a beautiful building because it
needs a new coat of paint? The most startling fact about the sacred Mount Fuji in Japan is that it
has a large hump, a gross imperfection on its slope. Davidson and its students are as sound as rock; the
problem we must face in library, Union, student relationships, chapel and in all our existing here is the problem not
of tearing down what is useless, but of pushing it aside with new and better things as they come along.
And it is the underlying spirit here, that of cooperation and mutual dependence and aid, that of respect for others,
that will overcome the faults and make progress in doing so.

Culture Gets A Boost For The Better In Davidson’s 1953-54 Guest Artist Series

Somebody deserves a goodly portion of praise for having obtained the services of Charles Laughton last Wednesday night. It’s been
a long time since Davidson has been exposed to a man who could exude culture orally and fascinate the audience
with his presentation. One has the conception of Laughton as a great, overgrown precocious boy, happily rattling off those stories
which he has committed to memory and projecting himself in fantasy into every part which he portrayed. Take away the
mane of gray hair, and the figure, and one has the impression of a mischievous ingenue—an elder prototype of Norman
Rockwell’s choirboy, with a slingshot hanging out of his hip pocket.

Perhaps Laughton’s greatness stems from his ability to completely absorb himself in what he is saying. He does not interpret
the speeches or the minds of the speakers—rather, he simply dons for the moment their complete life and personality. After
listening to him, it is hard to visualize him as a distinct entity; he seems to be a combination of
the Devil, Rembrandt, Barnacle, and a penitent Nebuchadnezzar. The moment's hesitation at the end of certain passages seems to be
a struggle to return to the reality of the stage. Probably some of this is only the actor in him;
mostly, however, it appears that he is genuinely engrossed in the beauty and feeling of the part. And in the
background, one senses the mental metronome ticking in his head, automatically controlling his balanced delivery. Anyhow, had he gone on
for another two hours, it is doubtful whether anyone would have left. He's great.

Culture ran rampant Wednesday. Running interference for Mr. Laughton at the evening show, we had Dr. Bonnell at the matinee.
Certainly he presented a chapel program which excited more interest than many preceding ones. Complimentary remarks were even made after
his talk, which is equivalent to a standing ovation anywhere else. As a matter of conjecture, he is probably one
of the leading protagonists of the organized church in this country. As an astute theologian and a dynamic speaker, he
ranks among the best.

Along the lines of culture, there is a surprisingly superior Guest Artist Series this year. Jan Peerce brings an enviable
reputation along with him when he comes to sing next week; Isaac Stern, personally, is the finest violinist on the
circuit today; Carl Sandburg, if he reads his poetry as well as he writes it, should fill the vacated post
of Robert Frost with a minimum of effort, and Claude Rains added the debonair, sophisticated touch. The whole slate is
excellent. We would have liked to see Cornelia Otis Skinner return again; perhaps that will be arranged next year. Anyway,
the culture is there for the asking—all we've got to do is go, absorb and assimilate it.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR:

HOOD SPEAKS FOR GROUP PIX

Dear Editor:

Some comment has been made in the past few weeks on the plan to use group photographs of fraternity members
for the fraternity section in the 1964 Quips and Cranks. We would like to outline our reasons for setting up
this plan and show how it is ultimately designed not to reduce the effectiveness of the fraternity section, but actually
to improve its layout.

When the original layout for the book was drawn up last summer, it was our intention to include on the
two pages which each fraternity is allotted as much significant material as possible. Plans at present include drawings of each
fraternity’s pin and crest, and a picture of the house, as well as the traditional write-up, picture of the sponsor,
informal snapshots, and, of course, pictures of the members. The extra space was gained by planning for a group shot
of the brothers and pledges, which fills about one-half of a page, rather than a panel, which fills one complete
page as in last year’s book. To use a panel again this year would force us to eliminate the pin,
crest, and house, features which we feel undoubtedly add to the attractiveness of the pages.

Perhaps even more important than layout is the variety which would be added by using group photos. Few would claim
that using the same individual pictures that have appeared countless times before in the book, (and the fraternities do come
last) helps to inject variety or individuality into the fraternity pages. A group picture, on the other hand, would do
just that; it would furnish a different picture for each individual as well as a picture for each fraternity not
patterned after any other in the book.

Some have said that with a group picture individual faces might not show up well. This is often true of
group shots, and it has been true of groups in some past editions of Quips. But this year we plan
to use a professional photographer with proper equipment and experience, and there is no chance that individuals might be hard
to identify. Others have claimed that the pictures should be taken in front of the fraternity houses, and admittedly, this
would be the ideal.
