**A testament to our institution**

We swaggered through the concourse of the Greensboro Coliseum after the Davidson men’s stifling second-half defense had led to a gratifying rout of Marshall. It started in the back, but, as with many chants, quickly circulated through the crowd after one or two repetitions. “Let’s Go Cats!” We yelled it over and over at the top of our lungs as we walked. As the mass of red kept walking and chanting, my sideways glance caught the faces of alumni, students, staff, town residents, players’ families, and fans. Many were my age; some younger, some older, some much older, many wearing ridiculous-looking red and black felt Dr. Seuss-style top hats bearing the words “Wildcat in a Hat.”

There were probably a hundred Davidson students or so in Greensboro that weekend, many of whom, like us, juggled Spring Break plans so that a long drive to somewhere warm would occur immediately after the Southern Conference business had concluded. Other schools, like Marshall, seemed to have no students there beyond their men’s and women’s basketball teams. But Davidson was well-represented by all classes, all races, all majors, all houses. We were there, loud and proud.

The point of this essay is to defend Division I athletics at Davidson. I could continue the above narrative and conclude that with Division I sports, such moments are possible and more likely. However, though such a course might be fun and easy for me, most of those who oppose Davidson continuing Division I athletics were not there anyway, and a flowery description of our spirited behavior would have no effect on them. Though it is also tempting to merely relate how my Davidson career has featured at least one incredible moment per year cheering on our teams, one columnist’s emotional appeals mean very little as well. Thus, the best case for the perpetuation of Davidson College Division I athletics is made using these experiences and some logic too, which may make for a more boring article, but hopefully a more persuasive one.

If the college budget were unlimited, most of the opposition to Division I athletics would presumably disappear. Sure, other Division I schools radically lower their standards to admit athletes, but that does not happen here. Sure, other Division I schools give athletes preferential treatment in the classroom to keep them there, winning games, but that does not happen here. Sure, other Division I schools cannot take pride in anything other than successful athletics, but that is certainly not the case here. Sure, other Division I schools’ athletes aren’t integrated into campus residential, social, and extracurricular life, but that is certainly not the case here. Basically, we do not in any way resemble the perversity and prostitution that some other Division I schools’ athletic programs embody. Thus, the issue would have to be resource allocation, right? If resource allocation is the issue, the debate becomes whether or not the benefits derived from the appropriation justify spending the money. Stated more clearly, do Division I athletics add enough to the life of the college that we should continue paying for them? My answer is yes, for four big reasons.

First, diversity. Davidson says it values diversity and sees varied interests, talents, and backgrounds as a way to spice up our education. We try to attract the best artists, scholars, writers, tuba players, interpretive dancers, et al. Attracting the best athletes requires that we offer competitive teams on the highest level. If we were to drop to Division III, those great athletes who see attending college as a way to compete on the highest athletic level while receiving a top-notch education will lose interest and seek their education elsewhere. Why would the next John Coltrane go to a school without a good music department? Likewise, why would the next Michael Jordan go to Davidson if our offerings in that area were not up to his level? Our academic standards must always remain high, yet our commitment to attracting those who are also accomplished in other areas must never wane. Excelling in athletics affords many students the opportunity to open doors. Davidson’s doors should never be closed to someone who has shown academic promise and wishes to play intercollegiate athletics on the highest level.

**Wake up and start dreaming**

People think that I am a tad eccentric because I am 20 years old and have imaginary friends named Penelope and Queeny. But I don’t aim to be eccentric; I just refuse to throw away my imagination or my dreams. I feel that even though my childhood is officially over, I must always explore, create, and imagine. I do not believe that anyone should let the world around them, the world of Davidson, crush their ideals or silence their deepest thoughts. Penelope, Queeny, and I are trying not to fade away as we struggle to find the place for dreamers in our generation.

My own idealism of the perfect society confuses me daily, and I have begun to view my deep thinking and my inability to ignore the injustices of our universe as a problem. Few people have encouraged me to question. Few people have urged me to climb blue trees. I think that the path my superiors and my peers steer me towards is the one that leads straight to the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. But my rainbow is colorless because I feel so alone in my struggle to cure humanity of its many diseases. I simply cannot accept the shrugging of the shoulders or the “that’s the way things are” attitude. I am ashamed that the seemingly rigid, stiff, and apathetic Davidson does not want to venture out of its ignorant comfort zone.

However, I have a glimmer of hope that others also feel imprisoned in an uncaring environment and that they will want to join Penelope, Queeny, and me as we attempt to break the chains that stifle our imaginations, our thoughts, our dreams, our hearts. Penelope and Queeny need more representation on our campus because they are invisible to most people. Be their voices and make their presence stronger. Please help us wake up the sleeping giants of Davidson. Let the dreamers emerge and scream, and then act upon their true dreams.

**Bill Gullan**distinctiveness. In the increasingly competitive college market, Davidson must remain unique. Believe it or not, many non-athlete prospective students see Division I athletics as a huge plus. When one hears the word “college,” one image the mind frequently conjures up is that of fanatic students rabidly supporting their team. I saw it in Greensboro. Davidson is the fourth smallest Division I school (second smallest coeducational school) in the country. The athletic scholarships offered are limited. Where else can one pore over an ancient text with a renowned professor in a class of eight people by day, and by night watch his/her friend, hallmate, fraternity brother, love interest, or SGA Senator beat the pants off an ACC team on the playing field? Our appeal to prospective students should certainly not guide our policies, but Davidson’s distinctiveness means more to us than a mere selling point; we attend a unique institution, and just as we should never sacrifice the Dean Rusk Program, Division I athletics should always be maintained. Our special mix of offerings and programs has made us what we are today.

Third, we are going in the right direction. Philosophically, the choice whether to remain a Division I school should not boil down to wins and losses. However, the reason we are having this debate has to do with resources in the first place. In Division I athletics, success means money and publicity. Georgetown University’s basketball team introduced many to a wonderful institution and, though their basketball team is not representative of the school as a whole, the publicity surrounding it helps. One is surprised how many people still associate Davidson solely with Lefty Driesell’s great late-60s teams. Our athletic program had a banner year. Men’s basketball was successful, but so was men’s and women’s soccer, field hockey, swimming, all the way down the line. And how about Coach Filar and the resuscitation of our women’s basketball program? Success and publicity in athletics bring needed money, and as long as we keep our standards high, the exposure competitive athletics brings to Davidson will only help the institution attract qualified students. The financial burden Division I athletics causes will be eased the more successful we become.

Fourth, harmony. Going Division III might make for some fun rivalries, but no matter how spirited they might become, it could never compare to the way Division I sports bring this campus together. The soccer final four my freshman year, the baseball victory over then-number one Georgia Tech and the men’s basketball NCAA near-miss my sophomore year, and the Greensboro experience this year are the times when I have most clearly felt the bond all Davidson students share. Sitting in the bleachers with just about all 1,600 students watching the soccer final four was like nothing I had ever felt. We were cheering on so many levels: for our friends, our team, our school. All that normally keeps Davidson students apart: different interests, backgrounds, opinions, ages, social affiliations, et al. They all disappeared, if only for those two hours. It is a feeling each generation of Davidson students should feel, the possibility of which Division I athletics ensures.

I am writing this the Sunday we all returned from Spring Break. Its production has been therapy for a mind numbed by a week-long consideration of hypothetical situations that would include us in the field of 64, and salve for a heart whose dreams were in the end unrealized. We will caravan to Columbia on Wednesday. I know not the outcome. Yet, either way, our men’s basketball team has had a season of which we should all be immensely proud, and one that reinforces the claim that Division I athletics adds so much to campus life. This year’s success has helped spread the word about Davidson the institution, while giving those already here quite a thrill. Our success represents, at once, a testament to our institutional pluck and a symbol of our institutional health. Though the battle over whether or not to remain in NCAA Division I has yet to be fought, I predict that students will overwhelmingly support the preservation of an athletic program that allows 25% of them to play inter-collegiate athletics at the highest level and provides wonderful experiences for both those who do and those who do not.

Bad idea, and even worse timing...

For those of you who don’t know, Kappa Sigma’s “Pimp and Ho” party/date function involves each Kappa Sig “Pimp” inviting two female students to be his “Ho” for the evening. Now, I could go on for pages about how demeaning this party is to women, however, instead I will concentrate briefly on how the actual date of the party is completely inappropriate: the party is next Saturday, so it precedes the following Monday’s “Take Back the Night.” Having this type of party is always a serious smack in the face to women’s dignity. This year, however, the placement of “Pimp and Ho” crosses boundaries of any argument of acceptability. It’s ironic that while next Monday night a group of very courageous people will be reclaiming the right to their own bodies and sexualities, the previous Saturday a fraternity will have celebrated destroying the individual, sexual boundaries of women — all in the name of a good time. This party is a defiant affront to the efforts of those who work very hard to make “Take Back the Night” a proud occasion for many women. Yes, prostitution has been a part of women’s history. Incredibly, however, the “Pimp and Ho” party exploits this unfortunate chapter in women’s lives with zero regard for those women speaking and listening Monday night. Many of these women have suffered immeasurably as a result of the same mentality behind “Pimp and Ho” — that a woman’s sexuality and body is something she must share, willingly or not. No, this party laughs, you do not have the right to your own body — we do. We own you and consequently can sell you off, and that’s fine with us because there’s more where you came from — after all we each have two dates. In the aims of having a fun Saturday night, this party shows complete and total disrespect for the participants of “Take Back the Night” and, moreover, their message of reclaiming dignity and individual control over one’s own body.
