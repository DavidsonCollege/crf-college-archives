Past Meeting

Free of the battle of

Bar and glass-front pub we

Enter lodgings longer than their
Width of bed, one window, sink and
Recessed drawers. Lamplight
Licks across the sill, meets
Syncopated klaxon cries on
Drizzled city streets.

Swoop of shirts and sweaters shuffling
Floors foreshadows narrow

Bed and bodies’

Grappling with low,

Liquid pants and

Sleights of hand. We writhe until two
Quiet coals, thin smoke enwreath
Debris half blessed by drunken grins.

Respite starts at spoken names.

They bell the air, toll quiet back like
Drapery drawn for furnished chambers’
Habitues. Our naming draws us to
Trap essences wet mouths had

Missed as we clasp

Spirits, smiles and in some

Square a car calls roundabout to
Voices floating streets to

Second floors. Our names....

We sleep while

Mist sheens streetlight into

Dawn. Once wakened will we

Search again to name and

Conquer silence, drown the

Exiled sighs of those who,
Stumbling, missed each other under
Piping music, shawls of rain, by
Carpet-pelted stairs?
