For sixth nationally through last week’s game against Guilford.

Statistics serve to show Pomeroy’s improved all-around play this year. He has caught 30 passes for a total of 450 yards, and with three games left to play, he stands just short of his total receiving yardage of 513 yards last year.

He scored one touchdown and his average of fifteen yards per catch is a four-yard improvement over the 1973 season.

Concerning his feelings about the season, Pomeroy said, “It has really been disappointing. I don’t know why we’ve done as bad as we have. It’s partly the players’ fault. We have a lot of potential so far this season, many feel that Pomeroy has done his individual best.”

Favorite sport and scored first in the field of the game. Quarterback Steve Watson culminated a successful 49-yard drive with a pass to Bill.

Wildcat quarterback Dave initiated a 45-yard drive, playing off guard Jack and tackle Jay Kopel. The result was the first touchdown. Coach Ed Farrell had high praises for both linemen and their excellent play.

After two touchdowns by Whitley and a field goal wrapped up in a fever of the Quakers, the Cats scored once more with a yard scoring plunge for the final points of the game.

Pomeroy commented that he was “satisfied” with his own statistics, but they were “not much consolation.” Personal success has not kept Pomeroy from suffering the general defeats of a dismal season. Coaches refer to Pomeroy with the following statement, “He has good size and speed and runs exceptional patterns.” Citing the six-footer is his best asset, and he will undoubtedly be missed next fall.

However, Pomeroy’s athletic pursuits won’t end when he hangs up his helmet at the end of the football season. He was a star performer in baseball last year, leading the team in three categories including batting average, home runs, and runs batted in. He hit for a .323 average while driving in 27 runs. His five home runs were a team record.

When asked what his favorite sport was, Pomeroy replied, “I like football more when I’m playing football, and baseball more when I play baseball. That’s the way it’s got to work when you play two sports.”

Pomeroy’s praiseworthy performance in football this year, along with his previous success in baseball, seems inevitable for future achievements.

Foley, the game was wrapped up in a fever of the Quakers. The Cats scored once more with a yard scoring plunge for the final points of the game.

Harper was sacked several times behind Wildcat lines for a sum of 55 yards in losses, bringing Harper a total of -5 yards in offense.

When asked about the tendency of the offensive line to allow Harper to be sacked so frequently, Farrell asserted, “Part of the problem is pass blocking. The more emotional you are, the more likely you are to pass block. We were behind in many plays, and the other team was assured of a passing situation and put on a big rush.”

Guilford gained 324 yards to Davidson’s 209 offense. Harper completed 8 out of 13 passes for 75 yards. Whitley completed 13 out of 20 attempts for 146 yards passing.

Guilford is considered one of the most improved teams in the country. Last year they broke a 30-game losing streak to go 1-9 for the season. After beating Davidson Saturday, the Quakers are now 6-2-1 for the season. Davidson is now 1-5 for the year.

In a post-game interview, Farrell had much to say concerning the reason for a lack of Wildcat football success.

“In this loss on Saturday we lost to someone we were capable of beating.”

“We weren’t keyed up. It’s all up to us, the coaches, to get them there. We went into the game very flat.

“Our team is disappointed after a loss and they are not very happy. I suspect that the feeling does not last long enough. We tend to forget those defeats.”

Concerning execution of play, Farrell said, “There were a lot of problems. There was a breakdown in defensive coverage.

“But, these things are very trivial. By being aggressive, you can make up for it. Right at the moment, we are not the least bit concerned with technical problems. We need to get enthused.”
