“February 23, 1975

(Ed. Note: This article is the first installment of a two-part series concerning admissions and financial aid.)

Davidson College officials have decided to readjust the admissions and financial aid policy in light of the grim economic forecast
for fiscal year 1975-76. College administrators will have to locate at least $200,000 in extra revenue to finance the revised
1975-76 financial aid program.

“If we could get a $200,000 increase in the scholarship budget, I would be delighted,” remarked Director of Admissions and
Financial Aid H. Edmunds White. “There will be some increase in the endowment, but surely not enough to cover our
financial aid needs,” continued White.

White was not sure how much money would be needed to cover financial aid costs for 1975-76. Also, he was
not sure how the needed revenue would be obtained. “It’s obvious that we have to have it, and I think
we’ll get it. I believe we’ll get a substantial increase in scholarship aid. I think the Trustees will try hard,
as they have in the past, to give a high priority to financial aid,” continued White.

The Board of Trustees will meet at Davidson on February 21 to discuss the 1975-76 budget. Besides asking for a
financial aid budget increase of $150,000 to $200,000 during the upcoming budget hearings, White has announced two important policy changes.
First, as compared with the Class of 1978, ten to fifteen fewer applicants who require substantial financial aid packages will
be denied admission to the Class of 1979. “We’re also going to increase our expectations of all students’ summer earnings
by $100,” said White.

“We must have within the next three weeks at least tentative figures that will enable us to make budgetary decisions,”
said Spencer. A problem basic to any financial aid program concerns the method of distribution of financial monies, according to
Spencer. “One of the basic problems is a policy decision as to whether to try to meet the full need
of a limited number of students or the partial need of a greater number,” he said.

Based on the 1974-75 expense budget of $4,400 per individual, an enrolled student who requires total financial aid receives the
following aid package: $2,500 in financial aid; $1,000 from a loan; $500 from a campus job; and $400 from the
student’s summer earnings. In 1974-75, only 15 students received scholarship aid of $2,500 or more. Listed in this category are
two seniors, six juniors, no sophomores, and seven freshmen. (See Chart).

“For every total need case you eliminate three to five half-need cases,” remarked White. As Spencer mentioned, decisions as to
which type of financial aid policy will be adopted “must be made.” College administrators indicate that the structure of any
financial aid program is grounded on various value assumptions.

“It is obvious that Davidson caters to a group of financially elite,” remarked Vice President for Academic Affairs John M.
Bevan at the Tuesday meeting of the Budget, Building, and Grounds Committee. Bevan indicated that Davidson would be unable to
admit students from low-income families if the college policy concerning admissions was altered. He argued that Davidson is able to
offer grants of substantial aid to some students because a large percentage of Davidson students require no financial aid whatsoever.

According to Davidson administrators, various agencies such as the College Scholarship Service (CSS) Davidson College Scholarship Aid 1974-1975 1975 1976

Further, the Financial Aid office will offer a higher percentage of loans and jobs rather than scholarships to students next
year as opposed to this year. Although White”Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

has stated that at least $150,000-$200,000 in increased revenues is needed to meet 1975-76 financial aid expenditures, he has not
yet provided other administration officials with a definite budget projection. College President Samuel R. Spencer Jr. urged the Admissions and
Financial Aid officials to provide him with concrete figures concerning the financial aid budget and suggest guidelines for financial aid
policy.

“Every year for many years, the CSS has provided colleges with financial tables estimating parents’ expected contributions toward college expenses,”
said White. “Three years ago, the CSS tables were way too tough; they expected from the parents far more than
they could possibly contribute.

“To adjust parents’ contributions to a fairer level, we met with many other colleges in Chicago to draft a new
set of guidelines,” continued White. No college is obligated to abide by the CSS guidelines. In calculating parents’ expected contributions
in 1975-76, Davidson administrators are again disregarding the CSS tables.

“The premise that we operate on is that we expect the parents to contribute what they are able to contribute
plus sacrifices.

“The CSS now has come up with tables which expect less from the parents than most financial aid officers think
is reasonable and than most colleges can afford,” said White. The CSS 1974-75 tables were readjusted because of projected inflationary
trends in the economy. For parents, the amount of money available for expenses (above regular living costs) has greatly decreased,
admits White.

Admissions officials at Davidson have not yet decided on the financial aid formulas which will be used for the 1975-76
academic year. “We will arrive at some compromise of the CSS tables,” said White.

As noted above, some definite decisions concerning the composition of the Class of 1979 have already been made. The 10
to 15 borderline admissions cases who will be denied entrance into the freshman class will most likely be white males
who require substantial financial aid grants.

“We want to treat students equitably in relation to each other, but we want to preserve the college’s resources so
next year’s class tuition doesn’t go up.

“We have a policy of giving special consideration to sons and daughters of alumni, to football and basketball players, and
to members of minority groups when comparing borderline admissions cases,” said White.

According to the Davidson Self-Study Report, the statement of purpose which guides admissions officials reads: “Davidson must always seek students
of character, of general as well as academic ability, of loyalty to the ideals of the college, and of promise
for future usefulness.”

Financial aid officials at Davidson award funds on the basis of financial aid needed. “I believe very strongly that when
there is a situation of limited funds, scholarships should be based on need,” argued White. Not all financial aid officials
accept White’s position on scholarship aid. “I will debate the director of admissions from Vanderbilt University on this very issue
in February,” remarked White.

Alumni scholarships totaling $116,000 are granted to about 150 students who do not qualify for competitive scholarships. The McConnell and
Dana Scholarships are granted on the basis of merit, but the amount awarded to recipients of these scholarships is based
on financial need.

In the 1973-74 academic year, the expense budget for the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid totaled $129,441. The expected
expenses for the current year are $132,800. The proposed budget expenses for 1974-75 are $135,630.

When asked of his philosophy on financial aid and admissions, White replied, “We have to start with the fact that
we have a limitation of funds. The only way we could avoid that is a fantastic increase in the endowment
earmarked for scholarships or a fantastic raise in student bills.

“Davidson, being relatively small, doesn’t have what I would call a heterogeneous student body, but we do want people who
will be interested in various areas and who will make contributions in various areas.”
