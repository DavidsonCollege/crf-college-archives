**Furman falls... | Eho, Booker power Wildcats to victory**

By Burcain Harpin, Sports Editor

Alfred Hitchcock couldn’t have scripted this one any better. In a bizarre game that only seemed somewhat fitting in this tumultuous season, leading scorer Wayne Bernard did not net a single field goal and freshman Jouni Eho—playing on a diseased foot—led the team in three-point shooting with a perfect performance from behind the arc Saturday afternoon as Davidson beat Wofford 76-69 in Belk Arena.

Eho, who was averaging three points and 10 minutes per game before Saturday’s contest, put on a dazzling 5-of-6 shooting performance Saturday, including four three-pointers. He also ran the hardwood for 25 minutes, playing relentless defense with a menacing glint in his eye that reflected only a fraction of the tremendous intensity with which he played all afternoon.

“Jouni looks like he eats nails for breakfast and he competes like he eats nails for breakfast,” said McKillop. “The performance he put on today, especially with a tremendously infected foot and not even knowing if he could play or not, was just very courageous. He is a great shooter.”

Eho’s first trey gave the Wildcats a 9-5 lead five minutes into the game. His was the third consecutive three-pointer for the Wildcats behind a Michael Bree score that put the Wildcats on the board and a confident jumper by Peter Anderer.

The Wildcats and Paladins traded points fairly evenly for the first 15 minutes, but the Martin Ides/Chris Pearson duo directed a well-orchestrated 15-3 run to end the half. A three-pointer by Pearson and four Ides free throws put the Wildcats firmly in control 42-31 at halftime. Pearson, who led the team in scoring with 17 points and also grabbed 10 rebounds, maintained a strong presence inside and his short-range jump shot proved highly effective.

Two glaring numbers—0 and 18—loomed large for the Wildcats at halftime. Bernard had attempted five field goals in the first half but none of them had dropped. The Wildcats’ leading scorer was scoreless. Meanwhile, the Paladins—one in particular—had no trouble scoring. Karim Souchu burned the Wildcats for 18 points in the first half alone, 15 of those coming in the first 10 minutes of the game. He dominated Furman’s offense, and deservedly so—he made good on 4 of his 5 first-half 3-point attempts.

But the Wildcats answered with freshman forward Nick Booker, who tamed Souchu by limiting the gangly 6-7 Parisian to only nine points in the second half. “I challenged Nick at halftime to really attack Souchu,” said McKillop. “And he responded. He did a great job of shutting him down in the second half. Nick has started the last three games with brilliance, taking the ball to the hoop. But what really impressed me about Nick tonight was his defense on Souchu, a great player.”

Despite subduing Souchu, the Wildcats still gave up a 15-2 Paladin run late in the second half that cut an 18-point lead to five with just over three minutes left to play. Groan. Not again.

“Was I getting nervous?” quipped McKillop rhetorically. “I was getting cognizant of the fact that we had done this Saturday night [against Greensboro] and hoping that we had learned from it, and that we had done this Tuesday night [against VMI] and did learn from it.”

And Saturday the Wildcats ran the two-minute drill well, not forcing shots and not losing their control or resolve. “I think when you do it in a previous outing like we did at VMI—we had a double-digit lead there and they nipped and tucked away and pushed the margin down to single digits—when you’ve gone through that experience, I think you get a little bit more comfortable in handling it,” said McKillop.

The Wildcats persevered at the free throw line this time, scoring their last nine points on free throws. Bernard chipped in four in the last three minutes, his only scores of the day. “Yes, he struggled to make a field goal but he did make four foul shots,” said McKillop. “And when you look at the stat sheet and see him made eight assists and only one turnover, I...”

---think it shows what he did for the team. It’s nice to see a guy who doesn’t make points help the team in so many other ways.” Ides contributed two from the line in the closing minutes, and Anderer, Pearson, and Bree each netted a free throw in the final minute to secure the victory.

Broken axle interrupts intramurals games. The problem was worsened when several intramurals teams were not told that their games had been cancelled. “It was an inconvenience, and a lot of guys on the team were upset,” said Stephen Rebarchak, a freshman intramural basketball player. The faulty part was replaced on Feb. 1. “The part was ordered in a timely manner, unfortunately the company is located in Utah and the part was not something they had available in stock.” Jones reports that five make-up games are scheduled this Sunday.

A broken axle on the left bleachers at Belk Arena has interrupted intramural basketball for the past several weeks, but officials say the problem is fixed. Normally, games are played on the two top courts of the arena, but the mechanism used to retract the bleachers would not function properly. Lee Jones, director of intramurals, described the problem as “a broken axle under the bleachers that wouldn’t allow us to roll them back into place after the (school) basketball games.”

SPARTANBURG, S.C.—Bob McKillop has talked often about the imperativeness of playing a full 40 minutes of solid basketball. On Monday night at Wofford, the Wildcats could barely muster twenty. A meltdown occurred so rapidly midway through the game that the outcome was decided long before the final buzzer. The 83-73 loss was disappointing for several reasons:

- For the fourth time this season, the Wildcats (10-14, 4-7) were denied the chance for a three-game winning streak.
- They lost more ground to Appalachian State in the race for third place in the North Division. A win over Wofford coupled with a win over the Mountaineers this Saturday would have put them in a tie for third place. They are now two games behind Appalachian State in fourth place.
- Wofford is not good. The Terriers (9-13, 4-7) are tied with Furman for last place in the South Division. Before the game, the team announced that two starters had been dismissed for disciplinary reasons. Only one player, senior Ian Chadwick, averages double figures in scoring. Chadwick, whose 20 points per game leads the SoCon, eliminated Davidson in the conference tournament last season when he hit a jumper with 2.8 seconds left to give his team a 65-64 win.

The Wildcats knew before the game that Chadwick would get his kicks, and sure enough, he scored 27 points on 10-13 shooting. But by far the most astonishing and damaging statistic in this game was the 31 points scored by Lee Nixon. Consider that Nixon came into the game averaging 8.7 points per game and that his previous career high was fifteen. On this night, the 6-4, 175-pound sophomore connected on 11 of his 16 shots and combined with Chadwick for 58 points, nearly 70 percent of Wofford’s total.

After the game, McKillop succinctly described Nixon’s performance. “We could not stop him,” he said. Just as importantly, they couldn’t counter his scoring at the other end. Jouni Eho (15 points) and Michael Bree (12 points) were impressive, but most of their contributions came in the first half. Eho, who notched a career high for the second straight game, hit his first two three-point attempts and gave Davidson a 27-17 lead 11 minutes into the game. That’s when it happened. Over the next 17 minutes, in a span that would decide the game, the Terriers outscored Davidson 43-17. Nixon’s three-point play at the 5:52 mark gave Wofford a 72-55 lead. The Wildcats hit four straight three-pointers on their next five possessions (10-19 for the game) to close the deficit to seven, but the 58 points scored by Nixon and Chadwick proved insurmountable.
