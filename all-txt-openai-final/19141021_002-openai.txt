### THE BASKET CALL

For two weeks the basket call has been heard, and a score and a half of class warriors have turned out daily to practice for the class games, which precede the Varsity season. The games thus far have been snappy and well-played, and fine Varsity prospects are before us. Basketball will probably play a far more important part in Davidson's athletics than ever before. If the Varsity games exhibit as much ginger as the class teams, and the student body shows as much enthusiasm as the classes are showing over the inter-class games this year, a successful season is assured.

### REPORTING TO THE COUNCIL

A large number of new men have asked how to proceed if they should wish to report a man to the Student Council for any violation of the Student Body Constitution. All such matters should go, of course, as soon as possible, to the President of the Student Body. But two or more students may report any infringement upon the honor of the student body to any single member of the Council, whom they prefer. He will carry the charges to the President, and a meeting of the Council will then be called. The names of the members of the Students’ Council are printed in the Handbook.

### WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

It is our aim to make the town column of The Davidsonian as interesting and attractive as possible. To this end, we urge all our friends in town who know of any items to either send them to the town editor, J. C. Carson, through the mail, or phone them to K. A. MacDonald, at the Power House behind the college dormitories. He has kindly consented to receive all such messages. What do you know about the goings and comings of your friends in the town? Please tell us.

### TO BE MAGAZINE REQUIREMENT

The purpose of the Davidson College Magazine has always been to afford an avenue for the expression of the students’ thoughts in a clear, polished manner. The Magazine has afforded an avenue for literary expression such as has been found neither in the classroom nor the literary societies. In thus bringing out the latent literary talent of our college and giving it a chance to develop, it has done a good work, but at the same time, it has been felt by many that not as many students were taking an interest in this phase of college endeavor as should. Accordingly, a motion has been passed by both the literary societies according to which every member will have to hand in at least one piece to the Magazine each year. As an inducement to good work on these literary creations, an amendment was added which gave a credit to each member whose piece was reported on favorably by the Magazine.

### The DAVIDSONIAN, October 21, 1914

It is hoped that this requirement of the societies will bring out some really good literary material and add much to our Magazine. The exact number of the Magazine perhaps is not as large as the ordinary number, but this can be easily excused in view of the fact that it takes at least one month for the staff to settle down to work after the Summer's vacation. However, what the Magazine lacks in quantity this time it makes up in quality.

"Moonlight on the Campus" is a pretty picture of the Davidson campus in the languorous, moonlit, summer nights. The only thing lacking to make it real is the husky cry of “Fire!” as an automobile loaded with “Phessies” skims around the walk.

"Uncle Henry’s Little Manso," written by L. A. Chambliss, has very good descriptions of Southern life in some rural districts a few years back. On the whole, this story shows talent for so young an author.

"The Age of Young Men," by F. T. Harkey, is a stirring appeal to the young manhood of America to come to support its country.

"The Claim of the Present," by Du Carro, is in its line one of the best pieces in this issue. It stresses the importance of ourPresent activities not only as a preparation for future life, but for what can be gotten out of them now. The Fishing Smack is a jolly little poem about how a young man was caught by a “rosy cheek and two eyes of blue.” Before we get through with the poem we almost envy the young man his fate. The Fishing Smack leaves a pleasant taste in our mouths which will not soon be forgotten. Such is the Magazine for this month, and while we know next month’s issue will be larger, we can only ask that it have the quality of this month’s Magazine.

ABSENCE COMMITTEE ON THE JOB. That the Absence Committee is no joke has been demonstrated more than once here lately. It seems that some members of the Freshman class, not being quite so well acquainted with conditions here as they thought, considered it unnecessary to attend chapel and classes unless they felt like it; and thought that the absence committee was nothing more than a couple of students. They have since found out differently—and some to their sorrow. However, though at times the committee seems stern and unrelenting, they are trying to benefit the students by keeping a record of all absences and sending out warnings lest one fall under the condemnation of a faculty ruling.

TEAM PLAYS FOURTH. Taking advantage of the Varsity absence, the fourth team had its first game of the season last Saturday and defeated the High School “Rabbits” 38. The Rabbits, though outweighed, put up a game little fight, holding their opponents on downs two or three times, and making their distance five times. Their interference was poor, however, and the backs could not get away for gains. For the college players, Crouch was easily the star, making several 40 and 50 yard runs. McKinnon, Shane, and Porter played well. For the “Rabbits” Par Robson, Brady, Hutie Brown, and “Baby” Alexander showed up especially. With a little coaching the High School should develop a fast team. A large student body crowd witnessed the game. C. B. Williams refereed.
