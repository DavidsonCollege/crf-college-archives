DAD WOULD WANT IT THAT WAY.

WASHERS, from page 5

Crews felt that more machines should be available to the students.

Pritchard, however, stated that there is not room in Akers, Knox, and Irwin for more machines, and the ones removed
from Watts will be used for spare parts. He also noted that the school hopes to “build some kind of
structure out at the apartments over the summer possibly to house more machines for student use.”

So I set out to test the new machines.

Things went smoothly. I walked in, bummed some Tide, and tossed in my stinking refuse. After setting the selection knob
and turning the little thingy, I was washing. Laundry room banter revealed some interesting observations.

Freshman Natasha Williams noted that the latest additions are “newer than the old ones” and “they leak less.” Freshman Marshal
Akers astutely noted that “They’re white.” When asked what she looked for in a quality washer, a visiting Duke freshman
stated, “I look for a really fast spin cycle.” Those Blue Devils know what they want.

Representing the sophomore class, Clay Adams, also a spin cycle fan, noted, “It certainly is a sense of power to
wash your own clothes with someone else’s detergent,” which has nothing to do with the new washers. Sophomore Rudy Lewis
had no comment on the entire situation.

Overall, the mission was a success. The new machines efficiently transferred the smell from my socks to my sweater, and
I was on my way home. One of the machines, however, began to leak at its connection with the wall
pipe as I was leaving. Water poured out and the floor got wet, just like the old days.

The problem seems to be only a simple pipe connection and the maintenance department should have it repaired with no
problem at all.

BREAK! from page 5

what an “ideal Spring Break” would be. One sophomore described her idea of the perfect break by saying, “It doesn’t
matter—any beach, just away from here!”

Some students imagined that President Kuykendall’s plans for Spring Break would include adding zeroes to our tuition fees.

No matter what you’re doing, where you’re going or how much you’re spending, take the opportunity to blow off steam.
The administration will appreciate it. The custodians will appreciate it. Have fun because you’ve got six more weeks of hell
when you return. Aha! That’s why we do it!

WATSONS, from page 4

selective colleges are awarded $13,000 to study a field of their interest.

Raney wants to study the phenomenon of rape and cultural perceptions and approaches to the crime. Her study will take
her to France, Quebec, and Martinique.

Mallory proposes to study the ability of Tibetan refugee communities in exile to retain their culture, religion, rituals, and other
customs while in exile, particularly in Europe. She also wants to examine what remains of the Tibetan culture in Tibet
itself.

VanEvery wants to study the interaction between folk and political culture and art in Central America, especially Nicaragua. She is
particularly interested in art used for political purposes.

Dunn’s proposal would take him to southern Africa to study the political, economic, and social effects South Africa has on
its neighbors Zimbabwe, Malawi, Botswana, and Swaziland.

Davidson applicants have fared well in Watson Fellowship competition. Since the program’s inception in 1969, Davidson has been awarded as
few as one or as many as four.

YEAH, HE WOULDN’T WANT YOU TO GET IN A FAMILY WAY OR ANYTHING.
