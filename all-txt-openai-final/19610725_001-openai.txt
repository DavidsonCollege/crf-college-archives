WELCOME TO SECOND TERMERS

The staff of the College Union
wishes to take this opportunity to
welcome those who have appeared on
campus since last Thursday.

There are many new and shining
faces among us, and we hope these
shining faces will become a part of
the Davidson personality this summer.
It is with this in mind that we will
here try to outline the place of the
Union in the summer program.

First and foremost, the Union is
the living room - the lounge for the
campus. It is here that we have our
meals, but more than that, it is a
place to meet for a rubber of bridge
or a couple of quarters of hockey.
There is a wide array of games avail-
able at the desk, including every-
thing from chess to Blockhead.

The music that is present comes
from a collection of over 200 rec-
ords, and is played according to your
requests. There is also the music
room where your own records, or those
you wish to check out at the desk,
may be played on a system of more
than average fidelity.

The Union also sponsors the Wed-
nesday Night Break, a gala held each
Wednesday night at 9:00 PM to allow
a break from studies and the partak-
ing of some free food. These breaks
also feature the presence of hostess-
es from the town of Davidson.

There will be more on Union ac-
tivities in this paper from week to
week, and if there are specific ques-
tions, they will be answered at the
Union Desk.

MEETING OF ALL DESIGN:

WEDNESDAY, 3:30 IN THE BLUE ROOM. BE THERE!!!

DING-A-LING?

Have you been having trouble
studying in the dorms because of an
incessant ringing? Have you been in-
terrupted in the middle of a conver-
sation on the porch of East or Can-
non, and had to shout to make your-
self heard above this same ringing?

If so, why not answer the phone?
The phone is the usual source of the
ringing, and it can be stopped by
following these simple steps.

Step 1: Lift the receiver (brack-
et-shaped object hanging from
the apparatus housing the ringing
bell) from the hook on the side of
the aforementioned housing.

Step 2: Ask (by speaking into
the receiver described above) to
whom the caller wishes to speak.

Step 3: Ascertain the room num-
ber of the callee (we leave this to
your own initiative).

Step 4: Page callee. This step
we also leave to your initiative,
but we would suggest that some meth-
ods are not completely acceptable;
e.g., the bellow.

Step 5: Return to your interrupt-
ed studying or conversation.

Although steps two through four
may be omitted in this quest for
peace of mind, we would hasten to
state that their omission may be as
bread cast upon the waters. How long
would it be before someone treated a
call for you in a similar manner?

uted by Steve Bender. Anyone who
