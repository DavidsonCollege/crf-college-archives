**Thursday, October 19, 1989 THE DAVIDSONIAN**

**BY HEATH HARDAGE**

Tatyana Mamonova, “the Simone de Beauvoir, the Gloria Steinem of the Soviet Union,” spoke last week on the subject of Russian feminism as part of the Soviet conference. The speech and panel discussion was chaired by Bonnie Marshall, associate professor of Russian at Davidson. The Russian KGB exiled Mamonova in 1980 for publishing illegal material and expressing contrary opinions on women’s rights.

Marshall began the forum by addressing the repression of women in Russia. Apparently, the “mothering role” is still women’s most important job. Soviets “encourage women to marry, but this results in exploitation,” she said. Although marriage and children are high priorities, “it is not unusual for a woman to experience 30 to 40 abortions in her lifetime,” Marshall stated.

Child care is another problem. Staff and food are in such short supply that children are often neglected. It is not uncommon for nurses to “give children contaminated food” or leave windows open to encourage sickness, she added. “Family life in many cases is a living hell,” stated Marshall.

Mamonova agreed. Soviets still believe that “a woman’s social and biological function is to mother...with such a belief they participate in their own exploitation,” she stated. Careers are often another source of frustration, added Marshall. “Women fare no better in the workplaces than in the family...Higher paying supervising jobs are held by men,” she said.

Interestingly enough, the Western idea of a “Superwoman”—the perfect career woman/mother—is held to some extent in Russia as well. “Women are still expected to perform adequately in the workplace while still juggling the tasks of wife and mother,” said Mamonova.

Senior Jennifer Bean, a student in Marshall’s 19th-century Russian literature class, ended the panel discussion with her views on Soviet and American feminism. According to Bean, there is a “female bonding of sorts, a sisterhood,” between American and Soviet women. She remarked on the “repressive mentality” that still remains in both countries. “The history of woman has been incompletely told, here and in Russia,” stated Bean. To overcome repression, women must use “their own unique eroticism.”

Mamonova has just published Russian Women’s Studies. She is presently working on a feminist book with Gloria Steinem and is hoping to return soon to the Soviet Union to organize women in their fight for equality.

**No drug policy, no aid, says Senate bill**

**By MUADI MUKENGE**

The U.S. Senate has passed a bill making it obligatory that institutions of higher education adopt specific drug and alcohol policies to qualify for federal funds of any kind. The FY 1990 Department of Transportation appropriations bill included the change in accordance with President Bush’s National Drug Control Strategy. It must still pass through the House.

According to the bill, universities will be required to prove that anti-drug and alcohol brochures have been distributed to students and employees. The following information must be included in the brochure: 1) prohibitions against the possession, distribution, or use of “illicit” drugs and alcohol on campus; 2) a list of legal sanctions for those who break the abovementioned laws; 3) a health advisory as well as a list of available counseling and treatment programs; 4) and a statement saying that the college will comply with local, state, and national laws in the prosecution of violators.

Universities will be subject to a review every two years by the Secretary of Education, and those failing to meet the requirements of the anti-drug strategy will be subject to penalties.

**Post-Hugo help, thanks**

**By MARGARET CARROLL**

A Hugo relief campaign spearheaded by the college Student Government Association raised over $400 in funds for the Mecklenburg area, according to SGA President Tripp Helms. After adding an additional $100 from its budget, the SGA presented a check to the Mecklenburg Chapter of the American Red Cross.Two-day fundraising campaign began a week after the hurricane crippled the Carolinas. A collection box manned by SGA senators was set up in Chambers, and donations were collected at the Hugo FAC that Friday afternoon. Helms said, “The SGA thought that it was important to help our community, and we decided that the Red Cross was the best place to send the money. Both the fundraiser efforts and the efforts on the part of all of the students who contributed to the clean-up effort showed that Davidson students really do care—and I hope this did not surprise anyone,” he added.

Also helping with Hugo relief, a group of students, headed by junior LaClaire Williams, went to Charleston this past weekend to undertake clean-up projects. The group of 11 Davidson students stayed at St. Andrews Episcopal Church in Mount Pleasant and worked all day Saturday in two areas north of Charleston—Copahee and Hamlin Beach. The group sorted through rubble of collapsed houses and cleared trees from yards.

At its Friday, October 13 meeting, the Davidson College Board of Trustees issued a resolution that recognized Duke Power for its prompt action in restoring power to the campus after Hurricane Hugo: “Whereas Duke Power Company undertook and carried out prompt and extraordinary efforts to meet our needs in this emergency, resulting in swift restoration of electric power and removal of damaged trees; and whereas this was accomplished with the combination of good humor and skill that has typified the service of Duke Power Company in usual times, and is all the more treasured in times of emergency; therefore be it resolved that the Board of Trustees of Davidson College, on behalf of the college, expresses its gratitude to its good friend and neighbor, Duke Power Company, and its officers and employees, for their professional, good-hearted response to our needs in time of crisis.”
