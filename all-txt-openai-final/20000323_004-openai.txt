4 THE DAVIDSONIAN

By Dave Love

Students, administrators, and health workers gathered last Tuesday to discuss current issues of learning disabilities.

The talk was the brainchild of Davidson College junior, Paul Gravel, who wants to educate students and demystify the treatable neuropsychological disorders that affect dozens of Davidson’s students.

The talk included a seven-speaker panel who discussed the problem of learning disabilities from all possible angles. Two students, Gravel and senior Kelly Rennick, discussed how learning disabilities can affect schoolwork.

Associate Dean of Students Leslie Marsicano explained the different paths she directs students towards to find help. Nance Longworth spoke about issues that she encounters in her work at the Counseling Center. She works with the students on structuring their life so learning disabilities can be managed.

Some of the most common learning disabilities are attention-deficit disorder (ADD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Currently, ADHD is defined as observable behavioral features that include a short attention span, distractibility, impulsivity, and overactivity.

In taking the good with the bad, many ADD people are privy to positive effects from their learning disability. Edward M. Hallowell, M.D. states, “Individuals with ADD have visionary imaginations. They think big thoughts and dream big dreams. They can take the smallest opportunity and imagine turning it into a major break. They can take a chance encounter and turn it into a grand evening out. They thrive on dreams, and they need organizing methods to make sense of things and keep them on track.”

The steps to conquering a learning disability are diagnosing the condition, education, structure and support, various forms of psychotherapy, and medication. The learning disability forum also stressed self-confidence and knowing one’s strengths and weaknesses.

Students with learning disabilities can be frustrated with the discrepancy between what they are capable of and their ultimate performance. This dichotomy leads to considerable stress and frustrations.

Marsicano encourages students to speak with their professors to discuss ways in which the disability can be handled. She explained that a blind student would not be expected to perform a science lab with the same proficiency as a student with sight. Learning disabilities can be just as hindering to a student and should be dealt with in a reasonable manner.

Rennick urges students with learning disabilities to “not be ashamed of the help you deserve.”
