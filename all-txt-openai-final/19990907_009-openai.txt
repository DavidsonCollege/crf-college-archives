The state of gender relations at Davidson

By JENNY HAPGOOD
Health Advisor

Currently, I’m taking a sociology class called “Gender and Society.” Today (Friday), we discussed gender boundaries and the circumstances that
cause children to segregate by sex. The author we were reading, Barrie Thorne, suggests that boys and girls fear serious
interaction with the opposite sex because it can be misconstrued as “going out.” Remember those days in elementary and junior
high school when Jill was going out with Matt but they never actually went out in public together? Parents always
asked what this ominous term “going out” meant and we always replied, “Mom (in that whiny ‘You should know this’
tone), you don’t actually GO anywhere, you just go out with someone.” It made sense in the sixth grade.

So, as my sociology class discussed the silliness of “going out” with someone before any of us reached puberty, it
was only natural that the conversation turned to the “going out” situation at Davidson. That's right, everyone’s favorite topic (and
I say that somewhat sarcastically because I, too, am tired of not knowing what “going out” means to college students).

Here we are; approximately 1750 intelligent, friendly, and interesting people, yet we can’t manage to get to know one another
beyond the back porch level. Unlike an opinionated writer in last week’s issue, I happen to believe that there are
many good “options” at this school if students choose to acknowledge them. We're striving to achieve a more diverse student
body in many ways, but for now let’s work with what we have and not dismiss people simply because they
may appear similar on the outside.

Assuming that most people at Davidson might be able to find someone he or she more or less clicks with,
there are still more options for that person. Option #1: Develop a strong, communicative friendship with a member of the
opposite sex. Option #2: Develop a strong, communicative dating relationship with a member of the opposite sex. Option #3: Don’t
worry so much about option #1 or option #2 and just think about your own well-being and sense of happiness.
As we all know, Davidson is hard enough without the stress of relationships. On the other hand, a good relationship
can help ease so much of that stress. It’s something to think about.

A note to freshwomen: in the next month or so there will be a forum entitled “Being a Woman at
Davidson.” The Women’s Issues Committee invites you to attend and to bring the questions, concerns, and observations that have been
building up over the first month of school. Hopefully, this panel will be an open, free-spirited discussion that might shed
a little light on the opportunities for women at Davidson.
