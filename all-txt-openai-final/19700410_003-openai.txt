After the performance by Lyon and Dick Murray, MEET YOUR FRIENDS at the GONDOLA RESTAURANT. Jones is scheduled for first singles. David Weaver, who was a sparkplug in the transfer, did a very fine job. Jim Barber in the intermediate hurdles should be tremendous duels. Jones and Weaver are set for first court doubles. Cantrell and Koury are second court, and Dumansky and Lankenau at third court. Fogleman is very optimistic over the team’s chances to recover the conference.

“No, I am not transferring,” said Adrian. “I am not even thinking about transferring. Everything about me transferring and contacting any other schools is completely untrue. All of it is based on unfounded rumors.” Adrian and the students at a small liberal arts college 20 miles north of Charlotte breathed a tremendous sigh of relief. Rumors had been spreading across the Davidson campus since last weekend that the sophomore whiz was thinking about transferring. “I did have some financial trouble,” said Adrian, “but it's almost completely cleared up now.” He was in debt to the Sigma Chi fraternity house, but he has now cleared that up. There was also a sizeable parking ticket debt that he had lessened.

Tom Scott's Davidson golf team registered its first victory in its attempt on Monday against the powerful University of North Carolina, 9-1/2 to 8-1/2. North Carolina was the first in a long string of ACC teams scheduled to compete against Davidson this year. Coach Scott hopes to expose his team to the powerful competition of the ACC teams. The Wildcat team has a nucleus of three lettermen: senior Danny White, junior Doug Dawson, and sophomore Toby Dawson. All of these golfers were on the team that won the Southern Conference championship two years ago, and they hope to take it again this year. Generally, there are seven players who participate in matches. The other four who played on Monday were Bill Grant, Scott Sheftall, and freshmen Pete Bodine and Ken Hill. In the UNC match, Davidson golfers recorded 2 wins and one tie. Dawson split even with his competitor, while number-one man Danny White, number five Scott Sheftall, and number seven Pete Bodine took their individual matches. White was medalist in the match, firing a 74.
