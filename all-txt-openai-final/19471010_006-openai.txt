Bate the drums and drop the curtain of sparks. It varies. Adequate age is effective; it exhibits the students’ interest
in a good life. Membership is the executive committee headed by Homer Hayworth, president. At its meetings, the committee takes
up matters of interest to the group. It is suggested that you ask yourself if it is wise to tell
the truth before the two old practices: that will help someone, and if it isn’t, it is best to be
silent.

College Band Expects Successful Year

DOCTOR CUNNINGHAM SPEAKS IN BALTIMORE

Dr. Cunningham spoke at a joint meeting of the Presbyteries of the Presbyterian Church U.S.A. of Maryland in Baltimore on
Tuesday, October 7. Dr. Cunningham attended a meeting of the Presbyterian Ministers’ Fund in Philadelphia on Thursday, October 10.

After the football season, the band will be reformed and will begin its rehearsals for the Winter and Spring appearances.
As usual, the concert band will go on its annual tour during the second semester. Most of the members from
last year are back, and from these, as well as the new members, we may expect a great deal of
music.

Wrestling Team Will Meet Greenville

By DOUG HIX

Upon entering the gym Tuesday, your reporter glanced into the first room on the left and saw what seemed to
be a ballet troupe. Further observations proved that Coach Charlie Parker had begun wrestling at Davidson. For the past five
years, wrestling at Davidson had fallen by the wayside with the apparent interest from the student body at large. It
was not until last year that, first Col. Grace, and then Coach Parker revived this interest. Coach Charlie states that
this year Davidson will run up against the roughest schedule ever known to the team. To mention some of the
matadors we find: V.I.I., Maryland, Washington and Lee, V.M.I., Duke, N.C. State, North Carolina, Appalachian, Auburn, and Georgia Tech. These
do not worry Parker for over 25 men turned out for practice Monday, among whom we find four lettermen of
last year: Jung, Price, Cox, and Alexander. Special interest should be paid to Jimmy Dragon Jung, who, wrestling in the
121-pound class, won all dual bouts and reached the finals in the Southern Conference. We also find on the team
George Council, who was one of Davidson's outstanding wrestlers before the war and has returned to pin a few more.
In the unlimited class, we find Ernest Strickland, who wrestled for Barrington Springs, big Bob Sharpe and Carl born. Some
other men to watch for are Woodbury Forest; Bill Fesperman, who was hurt last year, and Carlyle “Stubby” Evans, who
wrestled for Moore. Wrestling is the best body-building course known and requires its contenders to be in top-notch condition in
every respect. To prove this, our team practices like “dawags,” led by the lettermen from last year, for two hot
hours every day until the middle of November. They have three warm-up matches and then begin the conference schedule after
Christmas. Thus you see your wrestling team as it stands. If you can wrestle or if you are interested in
learning, it is your duty to try out. If you can’t, support your team.

This year's band is a new amalgamation of what last year were the football band and the concert band. Its
activities will include both spheres. At present, the group is hard at work perfecting drill numbers for the football games.
During the lull in local pigskin contests, concert work will occupy the group. Then at homecoming, November 1, they will
whip up some musical excitement.

President Hayworth pointed out that a “good nucleus” of old members are back and that coupled with the addition of
new members from this year’s frosh, we may expect a great deal of music. Approximately 60 men make up this
year's band, including an addition of a large proportion of new members.

On November 19, the band has been invited through Dr. C. K. Brown to play at the convention of the
North Carolina Music Association in Greensboro. Also scheduled tentatively in that month will be a concert in Mt. Airy. After
the Christmas holidays, the band will present a formal campus concert, which is an annual affair. It will be much
later this year than previously owing to the group's football support activity. Come spring, there will be a formal concert
here, plus many informal campus concerts as heretofore. The band will also take a southern tour, possibly extending into Florida
and lasting several days as last year. On last year’s tour, which extended to the southern part of Georgia, Melvin
Sipe, starring as solo violinist in arrangements made especially for the Davidson band, took advantage of his spare time to
provide himself with extra shekels to spend by posing as a blind fiddler. Being led around pitifully by fellow Davidsonians,
Melvin plugged along all the way from the Charlotte bus station to a pool hall in Thomaston, Georgia, where his
fiddle, dark glasses, and tin cup sucked in a total of about $25.

As an added enjoyment to practicing their instruments, the band members are looking forward to other coke parties after practice
like the two last year. There is also talk of a full-fledged band party this year too. The band is
a well-knit, working organization that relates itself rigidly. Members have been the following present members of the faculty: Drs. C.
K. Brown, W. P. Cumming, C. G. Davidson, F. K. Beagle, L. J. Schetick, J. F. Main, G. R. Vowles,
and G. B. Shankle.
