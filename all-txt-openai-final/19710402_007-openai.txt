Coaches Sign 31

What appears to be a good recruiting season is coming to an end for Davidson football coach Dave Fagg and
his staff.

“Overall we're in excellent shape,” Fagg said last week. “We have enough football players and real quality.”

Quarterback should be a real strong position on next year’s freshman team. Three of the quarterbacks signed have “outstanding quarterbacking
potential,” according to Fagg. These three are Dave Harper, 6-2, 185, of Stone Mountain, Georgia, Tom Kot, 6-1, 180, Magadore,
Ohio, and Bruce Baker, 5-11, 175, of Glen Falls, N.Y.

Several fine halfback prospects have been inked. Among these are Dennis Tweedy, 6-0, 190, from Evington, Va., Tom Acuff, 6-0,
175, of Nashville, Tennessee, Bill Coleman, 5-11, 180, Bedford, Va., and Gary Love, 6-1, 185, Milford, Ohio.

Top fullback signees are Steve Still, 5-11, 180, of Birmingham, Ala., Todd Chapman, 6-0, 190, from Charlotte, Foney Mullins, 6-1,
190, of Swords Creek, Va., and George Weicker, 6-2, 200, Baltimore, Md.

A real blue-chip prospect is 6-1, 190-pound Dave Peaco of Crystal Lake, Illinois. A split end and defensive back, Peaco
has clocked a 4.6 40-yard dash and ran on the International Junior Olympic team last summer. Fagg believes he will
be “one of the finest football players ever at Davidson.”

Joining Peaco as potential receivers are Ronnie Hamilton, 6-1, 185, from Charleston, S.C., Gary Pomeroy, 6-0, 160, Columbus, Ohio, and
6-3, 195-pound Eddie Womack, of Stone Mountain, Ga.

Dave Chmielewski, 6-2, 205, from McKeesport, Pa., heads the list of interior line recruits.

THE DUMANSKY STRETCH

‘Cats Blank MIT

If the weather improves, Davidson could have one of its best tennis seasons in recent years, according to head coach
Harry Fogleman.

“We have had two matches postponed due to snow,” Fogleman said, “but, more importantly, we have lost much valuable practice
time.”

In their first match after the weather became favorable, the netters blanked MIT 9-0. Fogleman said that the lineup for
this year has finally been set. The team is young, including only two seniors, but Fogleman felt he could call
it “one of the best in the country.”

The two seniors are Jim Cantrell and Jeff Chetwood. Backing them up are four sophomores, Jeff Dumansky, Bobby Koury, David
Weaver, and Hy Lankenau. The sole freshman on the team is Bill Allen.

Fogleman said he was pleased with the way the team has looked so far, and that they have been working
harder and playing better in the last weeks. He especially cited Cantrell as making great improvement.

The team has posted a 6-1 record, before the match yesterday with Wake Forest, their only loss coming to Rollins.
Today the team will compete at Furman, and then move to Emory for a match tomorrow.

Next week the team will host four matches, beginning with the University of Indiana. Tuesday the netters will meet Hope
College, and on Thursday they will host Indiana State University.

A cut of roughly ten percent has been requested in athletic funds by Academic Vice President John M. Bevan. This
cut in funds would affect the entire athletic department at Davidson, including all varsity sports, Physical Education, and operating all
the departments.Classes, expenses for the proposed cut in the budget are not final, and no final figure has been determined
for the operating expenses for this year. Yesterday, Dr. Tom Scott, director of athletics, met with Bevan and C. David
Cornell, vice-president of financial affairs, to discuss the proposed budget. “We will see the proposals they give us, and then
see if our budget matches the amount,” Scott said. “If not, we will offer a counter-proposal for them to consider.”

Colonel F. B. Outlaw, director of athletic finances, stressed that this was not an across-the-board cut for all athletics. All
phases of athletic life except basketball and football scholarships come under the athletic budget, and Outlaw emphasized that any part
of the program could be subject to a budget cut. “We will try to keep from cutting the budgets of
any teams here,” he said.

Several groups of students have become disturbed about the proposed budget trimmings, particularly the soccer team. The team, under the
direction of Dick Levan, has been circulating a petition among faculty and students requesting that no drastic cut be made
in their budget. Scott stated that the original budget presented to the committee had requested a five percent raise over
last year’s expense, but Bevan stated that a general curtailment of some expenses was necessary to balance the budget for
1972. “We are forced to make ends meet,” Bevan said, “and in a time of monetary constraints, it is usually
the larger budgets that get trimmed first,” he continued. Bevan stressed that the figure of ten percent was not final,
and a mutually agreeable figure would have to be found.

The Davidson sailing team took second place in a regatta held here last Saturday. Allen Lundy and Jim Hunter skippered
the team to four first places, two seconds, and three thirds. The regatta was won by The Citadel.
