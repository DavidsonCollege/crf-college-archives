Fall Blood Drive Offers Prizes

“This year in order to spur participation, the ROTC department is offering a prize to the freshman hall or eating
house that gives the most blood,” said Ellen Gyauch, ’82, Coordinator of the annual ROTC fall blood drive which will
take place on Wednesday, November 5 from 10 a.m. until 3:30 on the first floor of the Union.

The prize is a pizza and beer party sponsored by King of Pizza in Mooresville and Budweiser Beer. If a
freshman hall wins, they get to invite the freshman hall of their choice since the party will provide for seventy
people.

For the faculty, there will be a drawing. The prizes are a free dinner for two at La Paz Restaurant
in Charlotte and a season pass for the Davidson Fine Films. “We're also having a contest to see which department
has the most guts!” Gyauch said.

Last fall, the ROTC Department was rather disappointed at the turnout. Only 286 pints were given, a poor showing when
one considers there are 1700 students, faculty members, and employees. “It’s disappointing that so few give blood when they are
fully aware of its value,” Gyauch said.

This year’s goal is 300 pints, but ROTC hopes for an even larger turnout.

The Back Page

The Davidson Jazz Ensemble returns to the 900 Room with a more varied concert than ever. Dr. William Lawing will
lead the 18-member ensemble through music ranging from the 40s to the 80s. Some of the pieces include a 50s
sock hop tune, a few disco numbers, lots of 40s material, some Rodgers & Hammerstein, two Latin pieces, and a
medley of “Swingin' on a Star,” “Yes Indeed,” and “Opus 1.” There will be a surprise number which involves a
special dance group (Dr. Lawing would say no more than this)! The performances will be at 10:00 p.m. both Friday
and Saturday nights.

Wind Ensemble

The Wind Ensemble will give a short concert on Monday, November 3 at 8:15 in Love. The program includes three
20th-century compositions. The two major pieces are Henk Badings’ “Transitions,” an extremely contemporary number, and “Lincolnshire Posy” by Percy Grainger
which is built upon folk music. Also included in the concert, the flute ensemble will play an 18th-century piece by
Boisnortier composed for five flutes.

The current Gallery exhibit features Robert Postma, the 1969 Guggenheim Fellowship winner. The collection includes “very large, hard edge, abstract
paintings from 1969 to 1980.”

Born in Akron, Ohio in 1939, Postma has studied painting, drawing, and art history at Akron Art Institute, Skowhegan School
of Painting & Sculpture, Western Reserve University where he received a B.S. in Art Studio in 1962, Cleveland Institute of
Art, and the University of Pennsylvania where in 1963 he received his M.F.A. He also spent a year in Europe
in 1966.

Postma’s serious involvement in abstract painting began in early 1961 in Cleveland, Ohio. In 1963 he held his first exhibition
of large abstract paintings.

Postma currently resides in North Carolina. He was appointed by the N.C. Arts Council to be a master artist in
the artist training program in 1979-1980.
