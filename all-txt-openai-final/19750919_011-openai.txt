For over 130 years we've been using the word "quality" in our advertising. Once again, we'd like to tell you what we mean by it.

Our brewery was founded in 1844.

Blue Ribbon quality means the best tasting beer you can get. A quality achieved only by using the finest ingredients and by adhering to the most rigid of brewing standards.

In Milwaukee, the beer capital of the world, Pabst Blue Ribbon continues to be the overwhelming best seller year after year. Blue Ribbon outsells its nearest competitor nearly five to one. That’s why we feel we’ve earned the right to challenge any beer.

So here’s the Pabst challenge: Taste and compare the flavor of Blue Ribbon with the beer you’re drinking and learn what Pabst quality in beer is all about. But don’t take our word for it.

Taste our word for it.

Pabst. Since 1844. The quality has always come through.

PABST BREWING COMPANY. MILWAUKEE, WIS. PEORIA HEIGHTS, ILL. NEWARK, N.J. LOS ANGELES, CAL. PABST, GA
