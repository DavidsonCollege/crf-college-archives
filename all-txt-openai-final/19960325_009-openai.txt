THE DAVIDSONIAN OPINIONS MONDAY, MARCH 25, 1996

### Minor Turnout
**Audrey Edmundson**

As a student who could possibly benefit from the incorporation of minors at Davidson, I attended the so-called faculty/student forum on minors held in the 900 Room last Wednesday. I went hoping to gain new insight into why the faculty had previously voted against the incorporation of minors into courses of study. Out of the 60 or so people who attended the forum, only two were not students; one was a dean and one was a professor. This tiny representation made me feel as though the faculty didn’t really care how students felt about minors.

In the past few months, over a quarter of the student body filled out and returned surveys concerning minors and expressed an overwhelming desire to have them. Twice, petitions have been circulated, each time yielding over 400 signatures of students in favor of minors. Then, last week, at a forum that was designed to bring faculty and students together to discuss their attitudes concerning minors, the students had another strong showing in favor of minors. What does the faculty want us to do to prove that yes, a large percentage of students support having minors with very worthy arguments?

I salute the student-run Council on Academic Affairs, who have so wholeheartedly adopted this cause. Unfortunately, it appears to me that the effort has been less than fruitful; the Council has continuously proved that students want minors, yet the faculty doesn’t act on it because they say they don’t hear from enough students directly about how they feel. The forum was designed for the faculty and students to share those feelings. It really struck me that so many students sacrificed their time in the middle of the afternoon to show their support. It was just a shame that not more of the faculty was there to hear the commentaries and opinions that were exchanged.

The forum had the potential to clear up many misconceptions held by the students and faculty concerning each other's opinions on minors. Instead, it was quite one-sided, with students asking members of the Council and the SGA why the faculty seemed so opposed to the idea. Of course, they could only speculate about the reasoning driving the faculty decision. I hope that students will continue to actively voice their opinions on minors. I also hope that on April 2, when the faculty votes whether or not to accept minors, they acknowledge the sentiments that so many students have so strongly and consistently expressed.

### No Go on Ken May
**Thanks for all the memories ... and friendship**

A great deal has been written about the Super Senior class of the Davidson Men’s Basketball Team. All of this press has been well deserved and long overdue after four years of hard work. Before these five guys leave Davidson and call it a career, I’d like to pay tribute to one more aspect of their legacy, an aspect not often remembered. No one doubts the unbelievable talent and teamwork of these seniors, but what I'd like to thank them for is their friendship.

Unlike so many big Division I universities, Davidson athletes are tightly integrated into the academic and social lives of the normal student body. We sit next to Brandon and Quinn in class, chat and share a few beers with Chris and Mark at Twenty-One Year Old Night, and discuss last night’s game with Jeff in the line at the Commons. And they respond with genuine respect and interest because they are our friends. How often do you think this happens at bigger programs with more highly touted (but no more talented) players? In my experience, such “stars” are placed or place themselves in a position above or removed from the rest of the students. They are on a pedestal for all to see and admire but not to touch. That is what makes our guys so special. They are a part of us and enjoy being that way.

Let me illustrate with an episode from my distant past. Way back in the fall of my freshman year, I had the dream of playing basketball for Davidson. I planned to try out for the team, but was indeed very apprehensive about how I would be treated by the “real” players. I mean, why should these recruited athletes give one hoot about some little upstart who wanted to join their ranks? I couldn’t have been more off the mark. From the very day they met me, these seniors (then sophomores) embraced me as a teammate and friend, exceeding even my greatest expectations. As well as the respect they gave me on the court, these special players encouraged and invited me to join them on a social level. Need I say what a lasting impression their attention and kindness made on me? To this day three years later, every one of those guys continues to treat me with the same respect and friendship that they always have. I’m sure you all can vouch for the same experience. I guess what I’m trying to say is that what makes our Davidson Wildcat senior class so remarkable is not their...Amazing performances on the court, but rather their amazing characters off the court. Many players at their level can dunk a basketball, but not nearly so many will sit down and talk about it (or anything else for that matter) as a true friend. Brandon, Chris, Jeff, Mark, and Quinn, thanks for all the memories on the court, but even more for all the friendship you’ve shown the Davidson College community in your four years here!

“Pimp and Ho”: Brothers of Kappa Sigma, McKelvie respond

To the Editors:

The brothers of Kappa Sigma would like to respond to Katie McKelvie’s article, “Bad idea, and even worse timing...” in last week’s The Davidsonian. In the article, Ms. McKelvie stated that a “Pimp and Ho” party is a bad idea because many females feel it is a demeaning and offensive theme. She also pointed out that it would occur at a completely inappropriate time because it would precede this Monday’s “Take Back the Night.”

As brothers, we completely respect her opinion; in fact, we agree with it. For this reason, we have spent the last few weeks discussing a more appropriate theme for the party. Monday night at our house meeting we formally decided we would halt a potentially bad situation by canceling “Pimp and Ho” forever. All these events occurred before Ms. McKelvie’s article in The Davidsonian was distributed. Before writing her piece, Ms. McKelvie failed to contact any of the principal decision-makers in the fraternity concerning the party. In fact, though we had a closed party scheduled for Saturday night, the theme was yet to be decided when Ms. McKelvie submitted her article. Furthermore, “Pimp and Ho” was never registered or publicized by Kappa Sigma. With this in mind, we feel she acted unprofessionally and with questionable journalistic ethics by offering criticism without knowing or presenting all the facts.

Based on a party originally held by a group of off-campus students, “Pimp and Ho” originated as a theme party meant to satirize a certain lifestyle. Unfortunately, many people were offended by what they perceived as sexist and demeaning treatment towards women. Such an effect was completely unintentional. Many of the female members who went expressed their dismay at the reaction of others because they had a great time. However, we understand that the concept behind the party remains offensive. Therefore, we will not try to justify or defend the party and are sympathetic to anyone who may have thought it distasteful or insulting. Not wishing to offend or perpetuate stereotypes counterproductive to Women’s Month, we decided not to repeat the “Pimp and Ho” theme to avoid the same reaction this year. We sincerely apologize to any females who were offended last year and hope they understand that degradation was not our intention. Overall, we feel that as a fraternity we acted responsibly.

We would like to be very careful here in stating that we neither denigrate Ms. McKelvie nor her beliefs. We merely feel that her article, as well as the editorial cartoon printed last week, represent criticisms presented prematurely and without substantial evidence. When composing a piece that disparages a group of individuals — whether intentional or not — one should be especially careful. In the future, we hope that Ms. McKelvie, the editorial cartoonist, and others will not be so quick to judge.

Sincerely,
The Brothers of Kappa Sigma

To the Editors:

So as not to drag out the debate over my “Pimp and Ho” article to next week’s The Davidsonian, I have decided to address Kappa Sigma’s response to my article in this issue. (In the interest of fairness, I have shown my re-response to the “principal decision-makers” in Kappa Sigma so they might have the chance to include any re-re-responses in their letter).

While the letter submitted by the Brothers of Kappa Sigma states that they “neither denigrate [me nor my] beliefs,” the letter does argue that I acted “unprofessionally and with questionable journalistic ethics by offering criticism without knowing or presenting all the facts.” Clearly, I disagree. The weekend before The Davidsonian went to print early Monday morning, I told a member of Kappa Sigma that I had written the article. He expressed no concern that the party might be canceled. In addition, contrary to what the brothers’ letter says, the party had been “publicized” in the Rusk Social Calendar. As the letter from Kappa Sigma states, they canceled the party “Monday night at our house meeting.” Well, the entire paper was at the printer’s at that point so there was nothing I could do to retract any part of my letter. Thus, I fail to see what about my actions were unprofessional — I simply expressed my personal opinion about a party (that had yet to be canceled) in the proper forum: the school newspaper’s Opinions section. What “journalistic ethics” did I violate?

Sincerely,
Katie McKelvie
