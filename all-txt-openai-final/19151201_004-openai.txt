SENIOR ORATORICAL (Concluded from page 1)

The team was composed of Porter, captain; Shane, Young, Price, Bennett, D. I. McKeithen, and Murray. The program was opened
by a number of striking pyramids built by the team. This was followed by an exhibition of tumbling, diving, spring-board
work, and throwing. The work of Bennett on the mat brought a round of applause from the audience. The horse
was then led on the stage and the team put him through his “stunts.” When the horizontal bar work was
begun, the fastening of the bar pulled loose, almost resulting in a serious accident but for the quick work of
the clown who caught the bar and turned the incident into a laugh. Everyone regretted this accident very much as
some of their best performances were on the bar. Price closed the program by an exhibition of Chinese rope jumping.

LYCEUM NUMBER

On Saturday night, November 27, the students and townspeople were most delightfully entertained by one of the best Lyceum attractions
that has ever been presented here. The “Hampton Court Singers” are a part of the Ackahest Lyceum System, and is
composed of a quintet as follows: Miss Margaret Messer, soprano; Miss Blanche McTavish, alto; Miss Lillian Rosine, accompanist; Mr. W.
Clay Inman, baritone; and Mr. Edgar Brown, tenor. The interesting program, with the usual amount of encores, was arranged as
follows:

1. Forget Me Not — Introductory song by the whole company.
2. Come Lasses and Lads — A Maypole dance in the years of our “great-great-great-grandfathers.”
3. Who Will Buy My Lavender? — Solo by Miss Messer.
4. Old English Motion Songs — Three were given by the quartet with piano accompaniment as follows: “Thou Art Mine,”
“The Blind Man’s Song,” “The Wealthy Miller and the Tavern Maid.”
5. Dark and the Shadow’s Falling — Quartet with piano.
6. The Swing Song — Miss Messer and Mr. Brown.
7. Perfect Day — Quartet with piano accompaniment.
8. Harmony — Miss McTavish.
9. Crossing the Bar — Quartet with piano accompaniment.
10. Good Night Beloved — Quartet alone.

Intermission.

11. The Usual Way — Pianologue by Miss Rosine.
12. Foolish Questions — Pianologue by Miss Rosine.
13. Friday Afternoon — Recitation by Miss Rosine.
14. Mary Cary — A small operetta portraying the adventures of Mary Cary and her lover, Pat McGee.

The features of the evening were the singing of Miss Messer and the recitations of Miss Rosine. Much praise is
to be given to Mr. Witt for securing this delightful engagement and to Mr. Lane for the electric lighting fixtures,
which added much to the success of the evening.

DAVIDSON CONCLUDES (Continued from page 3)

...back with a splendid exhibition of offensive football. Black, eluding Wake Forest’s whole defense, went for 35 yards, only to
stumble and fall. The Baptists could not hold...the Davidson backs, and C. Walker went around right end for a second
score. Grey kicked goal. Score at end of third quarter: Davidson 14, Wake Forest 7.

STILL STRONG ON OFFENSIVE

Keesler returned to quarter at the beginning of the last period and the backfield quartet of the Red and Black
played rings around Wake Forest's heavy line until Black carried the pigskin over for Davidson's third and final score. Grey
kicked goal.

Rushing the ball in the last few minutes of play, Davidson was again seriously threatening Wake Forest’s goal when C.
Walker fumbled. Parker, Wake Forest's heavy full-back, gathered the oval and was speeding with good interference for a touchdown when
Keesler, Davidson's fleet quarter-back, nabbed him from behind. In one last desperate effort to score within the few minutes that
yet remained, Billings hurled forward passes in rapid succession only to have them broken up by Davidson’s defense. Final score:
Davidson 21; Wake Forest 7.

THE OFFICIALS

Mr. Hughes, as referee, and Mr. Hodgson, as umpire, both former V. P. I. stars, rendered excellent services as officials.
The only incident to mar their service was an assault upon Hodgson by Blackman, of Wake Forest, after he had
been ordered from the field for rough playing.
