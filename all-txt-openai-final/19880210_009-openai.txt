**Homosexuals are people just like the rest of us**

**The Gay Support Group**

Just as you thought we had receded back into the closet, here we are again. I almost regret bringing up
the subject, knowing how a majority of you are frightened by the implications of such an article. The fact of
the matter is, the Gay Support Group is not alive and well. (I hope you don’t find that amusing.) The
reason for this group’s inactivity is not because of a lack of eligible people, but rather because those of you
who are gay, lesbian, bisexual, ambisexual, or just plain oversexual are too scared to join.

I would venture to say that most students misunderstand the purpose and people that make up the Gay Support Group.
Part of the misunderstanding is because of thick skulls and closed minds, and the other part is because we have
not been clear enough in describing the purpose or methodology of joining the GSG. In this article, I hope to
address those issues I feel have made the GSG ineffective, and let you know that they stand corrected.

Like many groups of Davidson students, the GSG has to define itself in terms of what it is not. The
GSG is not a way to find good sex, or any sex at all for that matter. I want to
clear up that misconception (pardon the pun) right away. It is not a secret society (imagine a homo fraternity) which
sits around for days and weeks discussing possible additions and deciding on the fate of some poor confused soul. It
is not a group which has power (I’m talking about the power of blackmail), despite everyone’s mutual knowledge of the
others’ sexual preferences. You see, those of us in the group know that if we break the confidence of other
members of the group, our own asses get put on the line. We’ve never thrown anyone out of their closet.

Lastly, the GSG is not a group in which you will receive a label. In talking to other students, I
find this to be the most common fear: being labeled as gay, branded for life, looked at funny-like by those
few who really know. Absurd. This is the farthest thing from any of our minds. Why would we (as a
group or individually) who have our own sexual preferences, confusion, and troubles, try to pin down exactly what kind of
person you are? It can’t be done, and it doesn’t make sense.

Homosexuality is a weird thing, no doubt about it. How could some of us feel so natural in a situation
that makes many people nauseated? The answer is... who knows? A corollary to that answer is... who cares? Actually, a
lot of us care, especially those of us who are particularly spiritually oriented. It is not easy to resolve one’s
religious faith with one’s sexual feelings. It may not even be possible or right to do so. But in the
end, sometimes people of our age just don’t have a grasp on what sex they prefer. Regardless of our spiritual
wishful thinking, sex is often an end in and of itself, consuming lots of our mental free time. Sometimes people
mistake love for physical lust. The subsequent arousal may be a homosexual tendency, or it may just be a false
feeling that, if followed through, would be embarrassing and devastating. Our feelings aren’t always truthful to us, and our minds
must constantly analyze our feelings to give some direction to them. Homo- or heterosexuality is, to college-age people, often a
matter of choice. Because of shyness or upbringing, getting close to individuals of the same sex may be easier than
approaching the opposite sex.

My point is that all of us in the GSG are very much like you. Our emotions and hormones and
minds send us in a hundred directions at once. Some of us have made decisions, others haven’t. And still others
are stable now, but may change their minds in graduate school. The group provides the support of knowing each other’s
pain and indecision, providing a structure of belief, trust, and non-judgment. We simply accept you as you are.

Regardless of how comfortable you are with your homosexual tendencies—if you have ever had a homosexual experience which you just
can’t seem to condemn yourself for, or if you hate your homosexuality and want to defeat it by bringing it
into the open away from your mind’s eye, if you want to try to establish a relationship, or if you
just want to know that people like yourself exist, then you may want to join the GSG. The common denominator
for actually joining the group is a very serious commitment to yourself to be open-minded and compassionate regarding your co-members’
problems, preferences, and feelings; and to respect everyone’s right to privacy. The group should be a way to make friends
with people you know will understand—not necessarily agree with—but simply understand. Relationships are important, and I hope that the GSG
can become a way to foster good relationships. Don’t be shocked at that. What are singles bars for? What are
many Patterson Court parties for—with names that include words like “obsession,” “lust,” etc? There’s nothing wrong with having a place
that is good and clean and healthy to establish a friendship that may satisfy a real need.

If you wish to write to the GSG and cuss us out, forget it. Please don’t waste your time. If,
however, you want to have more information, a reassuring word, a little advice, or to join the group, then I
encourage you to write us. The GSG’s address is P.O. Box 135, Davidson. Only one member of the group opens
mail and reads letters. Your name (which, by the way, I hope you have the courage to include) is kept
in complete confidentiality through one correspondence. After the one person who opens mail receives from you a second correspondence, that
person will, with your approval, give you the name of another person (or persons) in the group to whom you
might feel comfortable speaking. With your approval, the mail-reader will also give your name to that other GSG member. You,
however, must always take the initiative. Sure, it’s scary, but your feelings are important, and you will feel much better
if you simply take a deep breath and open up. Don’t bother us with unsigned letters, secret hiding places for
responses, and other such paranoia. I repeat, only...One person opens letters, and only one person responds to you. If you
respond positively, then we all know each other and are better for it. No administration or staff are involved unless
requested for counseling purposes. If you are a member of the faculty or staff and actually want to join the
group, however, we’ll be happy to have you. The same procedure applies to you as to students. Finally, we ask
that you include in your letter a simple sentence demanding our confidentiality and willingness for an open mind and promising
yours. This is for your own as well as our benefit. Just as the Honor Code protects our academic freedom,
so may this pledge remind us of the responsibility which joining the group demands. I look forward to hearing from
those of you who wish to write.

The suburban sprawl that is engulfing the Charlotte area and crawling up the interstate freeways into once peaceful communities has
yet to creep far enough north of the central city and into this small college town in northern Mecklenburg County.
While the plastic coverings of the New South can be seen in the ever-growing steel-and-glass skyline of downtown Charlotte, 20
miles to the south, and on the shores of nearby Lake Norman in condominiums that are the emblem of a
new, emerging metropolis, Davidson has, for the most part, remained free of such cursory growth. White American colonial-style homes line
a quiet Main Street here, and big oak trees stand proudly and make the town even more beautiful three of
four seasons a year. There is a traditional Jeffersonian flavor to the town, and no wonder: The town is wrapped
around the campus of Davidson College, which Jefferson himself would have been proud to see thriving in this time of
quick-fix and desultory higher education. And like the town of Davidson itself, Davidson College remains impervious to the upheaving of
tradition around it. The students of this liberal arts college of 1,400 still study and live by the honor system,
taking unproctored exams and walking in and out of the library without book-detecting devices that assume the worst in people.
The students here still are asked to think and to study the philosophies, the histories, the literatures, and such. Admissions
standards remain high—the average college board score of an incoming freshman is 1,230—despite the growing popularity of the school. Old
buildings and trees are not just carelessly disposed of to make room for new parking lots or athletic complexes, although
a new and long overdue basketball arena that will seat 6,500 will open on campus in less than two years.

These are heady times for Davidson. The school has produced two of the last three governors in North Carolina and
five current Congressmen. (Seeing Governor Jim Martin cheer for the Wildcats at the Southern Conference basketball tournament each year is
always a sight.) The college continues to produce an inordinate amount of the region’s attorneys and doctors. And yet the
school’s athletic program is also enjoying success. The basketball team has won 20 games each of the last two years
and in 1986 won the Southern Conference tournament championship and played in an NCAA tournament game at the Charlotte Coliseum.
The baseball team has won 20 games for three straight seasons, and the tennis and soccer teams are doing well,
too. In fact, the only blot on the school’s athletic ledger is the football team. It is, however, a big
blot: Davidson has won just one football game in three years and only five in the last five years. The
reason for this lack of success in football is simple. The school prefers not to give athletic scholarships to the
50 or 60 players needed to be competitive, and the school feels that since it is not competitive with larger,
state-supported schools like Appalachian State, it should not play in the Southern Conference. Because of this adamant stance by the
college’s board of trustees, the football program is a laughingstock. It is also the reason that, come June, Davidson will
leave the Southern Conference after 52 years. It is a divorce that Davidson does not want, but it is one
that the school believes must come before the school is forced to compromise its academic ideals. The board of trustees
believes that giving scholarships to a football team would put too many of its students—about 10 percent of an 830-member
male student body—on athletic scholarship, and that is something it will just not have. (Basketball players do receive athletic scholarships.)
On the other hand, Davidson’s refusal to play for the conference football championship since 1974 is something the Southern Conference
will not have, either, and it has.
