FOURTEEN TRACKMEN to be in much better shape and to do much (Continued from page 1) been that there have not been enough men It is hoped that this will be remedied next year by requiring each freshman to go out for some athletic sport, and a good many of them are expected out for track. If the present plans mature, track will be begun next fall at the same time with football and continued until cold weather intervenes. There will be both a varsity and a freshman cross-country team and a great deal of interest and enthusiasm is expected concerning meets to be held. out for track. i better work in the spring. All track events will be taken up in the fall just as in the spring.

Example of the law of diminishing returns—the laundry.

Chief of Police—"Do you mean to say that this fellow choked a fellow to death in a well-lighted cafe in front of over a hundred and fifty people? Didn’t anybody interfere?”
Cop—"No, Cap, everybody thought they were dancing."

With the fall practice, the men are expected to be in much better shape and to do much better work in the spring. All track events will be taken up in the fall just as in the spring.

Camel is the modern favorite

MODERN smokers make known their preference. And they call for Camels. Never in any age was there a smoking favorite like Camel is today. Camels understand every mood of the modern smoker. Camel mildness and smoothness are supreme with the critical taste of present-day people. A purchase of Camels brings you the choicest Turkish and Domestic tobaccos. Blended by skill into the world’s most popular smoke, and the best. Quality unapproached, is the distinguishing mark of Camel. No matter what the price, there is no better cigarette than Camels. Smoke them as frequently as you please. You will never be left with a cigaretty after-taste. Camels aren’t made that way. That is why modern smokers everywhere demand them. That is why this age has discovered the tobacco phrase, “Have a Camel!”
