You weren’t meant to be no

preacher’s wife

sitting in the pews, your spirit
filled the house, and his words
were nothing,

the sound of his voice

a garbled nonsense

your two-year-old son heard it

and was annoyed

You at dinner, all the words

eaten long ago, sat in silence
waiting to leave, go home, and
dream of other men

you were only half-alive

And again when you met him,
your lithium man, your fatal attraction
almost

killed by his jealous lovers, he
beat you for your strength

You were only half-alive
again

when you dragged yourself,
stray-catlike into our midst

A wino, a skeleton, with big
brown-blue eyes and a passion,
seeing sex in the

Rorschachs, and men out the windows
Always laughing, my wiry woman,
winding your way into happiness.
Adriana Tavernise
Class of 1993

Awards

Continued from page 9.
Black seemed to be the clear choice
last year, and he won. Despite the
powerful surges of Jackson and
Strait, despite even the industry’s
love of Gill, this one has to go to
Brooks, the clear choice this year.
He was country music in ‘90-’91;
any other choice here would show
an effort on the CMA’s part to
avoid a sweep, and would be a
mistake. Who should: Brooks
Who will: Brooks

Music Video: “Come Next Mon-
day”, K.T. Oslin; “Don’t Rock the
Jukebox” Alan Jackson; “Fancy”,
Reba; “Love Can Build a Bridge”,
the Judds; “The Thunder Rolls”,
Garth. - - - A very tough one to
pick. Picking Brooks’ video would
build his award total and would
make lots of people angry (it was
banned in some places for being
too violent). Look for “Come Next

Monday” as a great choice; Oslin
is the Bride of Frankenstein in this
cleverly-written spot. Also look
for the Judds, pulling the heart-
strings, or Reba, whose “Fancy” is
a crowd favorite. Who should:
“Come Next Monday” Who

Take I-77 to Exit 33
Go Right - 2 Miles:

will: The Judds (or K.T.? Sympa-
thy or merit?)

That’s all for now. Come back
next week, and we'll finish up and
get ready for the 2nd. Bye now!

Inspired by Bush's vision of a new world order and
perplexed with the question of how to spend slashed
NEA funds, ever clever senator Helms (R-N.C) goes
global with the Department of International Censorship
of Sleaze, Unnatural acts, and Crazy people. Says
Helms, "Them Italians need to make pizzas and not
them durn peeverted statues."
