_ THE DAVIDSONIAN

Court, from page 1
"feel like their own," said Hamm.
Walker likened the first experience of Patterson Court to the opening of a new Walmart.
"Everybody rushes over to try something new for the first time. Some people like what they see. Some people don’t.
And very soon the novelty has worn off."

This year’s First Night Down met mixed reviews from first-year students. The Davidsonian asked the following students to describe their
First Night Down experiences. Here are edited excerpts from their reflections:

The second time, however, I ditched my favorite shirt and denim skirt. I knew it was time to go home.

I missed the pancakes at Fiji and ended up locking my door to avoid scary drunk people in the hallway.
Some of my friends have great first night down memories (or at least pictures). I have an irremovable beer stain
on my favorite shirt.

When I finally arrived at the SAE party around 11:45 pm (Think of how awful it would be if we
were the first ones there," said a friend.) things went well for about the first hour. Scott Sherrill '08 and
Stewart Pierce-Gardner '08 (surely a fire hazard) made both entry and exit difficult. It was exhilarating and fun... except for
that one beer that someone spilt on one of the authors’ feet.

After that fast and frantic party, the house of Fiji was an excellent place to ‘chill.’ The music, of a
more mellow sort, with a man on a bongo and another with a guitar, made this an excellent place to
put a name to that face you had seen around.
