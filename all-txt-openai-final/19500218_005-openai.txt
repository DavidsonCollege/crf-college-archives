Wingate Again Ekes Out Win Over Frosh In Overtime, 72-70

By BILL FARRIOR

The Wildkittens held a five-point lead at the end of the first half only to have it taken from them early in the third quarter. From that point on it was a nip and tuck ball game, the difference in scores seldom being more than one point. The game time ran out with the frosh in possession of the ball and the score knotted up at 62 all. In the closing minutes of the overtime period, the Kittens were behind, 69-72, when Vance received two free throws as the result of a foul. He sank his first shot and in a futile attempt, tried to bounce his second off the backboard in order to gain one more shot at the basket. Wingate, however, gained possession of the ball and the game ended at this point.

Graham and King were high scorers for the Kittens with 17 and 16 points, respectively. Gordon, of Wingate, led both teams with 27 points.

Strong VMI Defeats Matmen Handily 21-3

By BILL BROOKS

Davidson’s grapplers played host to V.M.I.’s Keydets last Friday afternoon and came out on the short end of a 21-3 count. However, all was not so dark as the score would indicate. For instance, the 128-pound conference champ edged out Johnny Kelton by a 5-4 decision. The match was even at 4-4 in wrestling points, but the Keydet had a minute more “riding time,” thus winning. Last year this same boy pinned Kelton handily, so if past performances mean anything one might look for a victory for Johnny in the conference meet to be held March 6, at Maryland.

Hal Haynes won his match, skunking his foe by a 4-0 decision. Good boy! Our only victory for the day, so Hal saved us from a shut-out. Biggest “let-down” was that applied to Mac McNeeley, Davidson's “Gorgeous George.” This was Big Mac’s first conference defeat (also his first season) so great things may well be expected from him before Davidson turns him loose on the cold, cold world. A little more experience and he should be unbeatable.

In the other matches, Dan Bell lost 8-2, Pendleton by 16-7, Covell by 8-1, Price by 9-1, and Alexander by 5-1. There was one saving grace, even in this defeat, though. Nobody was pinned.

With only three more home games, one of the school’s finest basketball players and athletes, Whit Cobb, is nearing the conclusion of a brilliant collegiate sports career. Known for his sportsmanship and integrity, as well as his ability, the lithe, 150-pound three-sport letterman is recognized as the best defensive guard in the conference, despite his lack of size and a hampering asthmatic condition.

An All-State selection the last two years, the former Durham High school star probably will not make as many points this year as last season when he led the league’s guards in scoring, but is improving his scoring with every contest and has averaged 11 points per game for the last two weeks to bolster his standing among the top scorers in his position. However, his leadership of a team composed of totally inexperienced players has been almost as noteworthy as his individual defensive ability when assigned to guard the opposition’s high scorer. His smoothness and speed are best illustrated by a surprisingly low foul mark of only 1.2 per contest.

Coach Boydson Baird thinks of the Presbyterian captain as a guiding light, saying that, “it is impossible to overestimate the ability of Whit.” The quiet, steady, fast-moving team leader is the type of player that would ordinarily escape attention, but the slim, clever ball handler is usually the crowd’s favorite wherever he plays, not only for his spectacular floor play and generalship, but also for good sportsmanship.

The newspapers and their ever-observant sportswriters join with opposing players and coaches in glowing reports. The Durham Sun, probably thinking of the game this year in which Whit allowed Duke's high-scoring ace, Dick Groat, to make only one field goal instead of his average 18 points, said: “He (Cobb) is undoubtedly the conference’s best defensive man.” This was exemplified by another fine demonstration against UNC when Hugo Kappler, selected by the Davidson coach as their biggest threat, had to settle for two buckets for a game's efforts. In addition to his solid defense, Whit has consistently been one of the best long set shot artists.in the loop, always being good for three or four long-distance hits a game. Against N. C. State, in their initial clash, Dick Dickey was only able to get a half-dozen points, while in the second game with the Wolfpack, it was the 21-year-old Independents 37; Sigma Chi 27 to win. SAE’s 37; Sigma Chi 36 Staving off a great Sigma Chi last-minute rally, the fast-improving SAE roundballers dropped in a basket in the last few seconds to take a close 37-36 victory. The game was tight from the starting whistle, and the lead changed hands several times. The SAE's held a 22-20 half-time advantage. Merrell paced the Sigma Chi's with 13 points, while Bennett led the SAE’s with 12.

Phi Delt’s 37; Beta’s 29 The Phi Delt’s managed an easy win over the Beta’s by a score of 37-29. It was the Phi Delt's all the way with Jim Cobb and White paving the way by hitting the cords for 13 each. Russell and Elliott were the offensive pair for the Beta’s, hitting 10 points apiece.

SPE’s 33; Campus Club 28 The Campus Club put up a fight before they were beaten, 33-28, by the fast-improving SPE’s. Jimmy Miller hit 13 for the SPE’s, while Fitzgerald Whitfield hit 11 for the Campus Club. The Campus Club has yet to win.

COBB WINDING UP BRILLIANT CAREER A senior who kept the Wildcats in the contest up until the final minutes with the score knotted 35-35 and three minutes to go, Cobb covered Ranzino this time, and big Sammy had his average cut in half, throwing in only 10 points under the Davidson guard's surveillance. The Winston-Salem Sentinel carried a large photo of the Cat captain last week, labeling it, “the most underrated basketball player in the conference.” The Charlotte Observer speaks of Whit as a 40-minute veteran who is as competent a guard as you will likely find, pointing out that he is the steadying influence that keeps the team from falling apart. The Durham Herald spoke of Whit as “one of the finest collegiate athletes to come from Durham.” It pointed out a fact that few folks knew — Whit was a regular T-formation quarterback on the Bull football team and did a highly commendable job. An officer in his fraternity, a leader in campus circles, and a good student, Whitlock was elected overwhelmingly to the presidency of the student body, the highest undergraduate honor. Whit is the nephew of one of the South’s greatest cagers, John Cobb, an all-time All-American who played on North Carolina’s national championship team of 1924. Whit's acts of sportsmanship have gained even more respect for him. Down in Columbia, S.C., last week, the Wildcat captain had the ball out of bounds ready to throw it to his teammates, who had the Gamecock defense at a disadvantage by virtue of a spill to their elongated center, Jimmy Slaughter. Instead of playing the ball while Slaughter was down, he helped the tall pivotman to his feet, making sure he was not injured. While this act may have cost the Presbyterians the game, as they lost by one basket, it proved that there is still a sense of fair play among athletes and especially in the person of the Davidson guard. Another example of his excellent sportsmanship was seen two years ago against Maryland when an opponent, seeking to prevent a crip shot, slipped to the floor painfully hurt. The fall left the way open for an easy lay-up shot, but instead of shooting, Whit called for time out and went over and assisted the injured player from the floor. Such acts are scarce and so are boys who earn nine varsity letters, share the state doubles crown in tennis, run an excellent 220 and 440, hold the school’s highest honors in sports and leadership, while suffering from asthma and weighing a meager 150 pounds. But then, boys with the drive and ability of Whit Cobb don’t come along very often.

The Davidsonian To Your Girl PAGE FIVE VMI No Trouble At All In Basketball By BILL FARRIOR The VMI Cadets were no match for the superior Wildcat hoopsters as they shrank under the terrific pounding of the Cats. Davidson shot out into an early lead and were seldom in danger. The half-time score of 34-21 gave an indication of what was to follow. Brooks and Hengeveld were high scorers for the Cats with twelve points apiece, while Nay and Portasik accounted for eleven points each for the Cadets.
