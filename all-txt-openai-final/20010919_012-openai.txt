The first athletic event to take place at Davidson after last Tuesday’s terrorist attacks was not only a resounding Wildcat victory, but also a welcome diversion after a tough week. After recently receiving a ninth-place ranking in the South Region, as voted on by the National Soccer Coaches Association, the Wildcats asserted their dominance by knocking off the Radford Highlanders on Sunday by a score of 4-1. With the win, the team improves to 4-1 on the season, its best start since the 1990 campaign.

Senior co-captain Chris Norbet, who was named Southern Conference Player of the Week for his performances against UNC-G and Army, once again proved his offensive prowess as he netted two goals and added an assist. “I was glad to see Chris keep his momentum going,” commented Coach Matt Spear. “He’s averaging two goals per win, which is very exciting, and he will be nominated again for Player of the Week.”

Goalkeeper Soren Johnson ’03 repeated his shutout performance against Army as he thwarted four shots and combined with sophomore net-minder Shahid Sugeir for the win. Justin Saunders ’02 opened the scoring for the Wildcats when he skillfully placed a Norbet rebound in the back of the net during the 39th minute. Saunders and Norbet combined again, this time in the 48th minute, as Norbet knocked a Saunders pass beyond the reach of the Radford keeper.

Davidson took a 3-0 lead in the 64th minute when co-captain Jon Tetirick ’02 sliced and diced his way through two Highlander defenders before connecting with Norbet to seal the fate of the Radford squad. Dan Ferriter ’05 rounded out the scoring by tallying his third goal of the season in the 83rd minute off a pass from junior Hussein Nasreddin. The Highlanders scored their lone goal of the match on a penalty kick in the 75th minute.

Next up for the Wildcats is their Southern Conference foe, the University of North Carolina-Charlotte, on Saturday evening. “UNCC is a big rival and we’d love to have all the fan support we can get,” Spear added. The contest is scheduled to begin at 7:00 pm in Richardson Stadium.

### Apologies for Patriotism
By Jimmy Swansbrough, Sports Editor

I'll start with an apology. Sure, it's not really warranted, but nevertheless, we can't deliver all the sports news fit to print this week. It didn't happen. What did happen? A golf tournament and a soccer game, the results of which are brought to you with pleasure. Because of Tuesday, that's all I can give you. If you'd like, I can give you the notes I took in the classes I attended Tuesday, but I'm sure you're bogged down in the homework your school deemed appropriate to assign you that day. Don't forget that homework now, because I'm sure you all were assigned some in those classes you absent-mindedly attended in between frantic phone calls and numbing hours in front of a television. Are you feeling the sarcasm I'm throwing at you? Good, 'cuz I'm layin' it on pretty thick.

I praise student body president Joey Harris' letter to the editor last week, and I praise the Southern Conference for its appropriate postponement of athletic competition. Beyond transportation troubles, who would have felt like competing anyway? Who felt like doing anything last week, beyond journeying to Wal-Mart in search of something red, white, and blue?

For me, the pre-determined crash of four American airplanes incited a challenge within my breast. Allow me, for a minute, to slip into hokey metaphor. I feel like my team got scored on right before halftime via a foul play the referee failed to see. Referees represent that higher power that never seems to understand the game as well as me. Did I mention my team's tallest, strongest player was injured in that last play? The whistle blown, my team moves to the locker room angry and hurt. We fume at our susceptibility, worry what our coach will say, and unite in regret and sorrow for our injured teammate. His career may be over.

Our coach finally enters, but he doesn't kick over a water cooler in disgust. He doesn't throw chairs or curse the ref, and he doesn't let his assistant speak for him. Our coach steps to a board and plans the second half. He says we have to clear our heads. We have to forget the dirty play that hurt our team, and figure out how to win. His serenity rouses our adrenaline; I feel that competitive chill shudder my spine and warm my blood. I want to get back out there—and by God, I want to win. I'm a damn benchwarmer, but I know my team. They're affected, in the zone now, and without cower or concern they'll raise the game to new heights. The other team won't...
