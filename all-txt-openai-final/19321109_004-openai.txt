TREKKING WEST

WILL ROGERS ENTERTAINS AT BEVERLY HILLS

By JACK WILLIAMS, Jr.

NOTE: Below is one of a series of articles written in connection with a visit by the writer to the
National Editorial Association meeting with his father in California.

One evening a dinner was given in honor of the newspaper party in Coldwater Canyon Park, at Beverly Hills. On
the way, the driver pointed out many of the homes of the screen stars and celebrities. On arriving, we were
surprised to learn that the tables were set on top of the city reservoir containing 8,000,000 gallons of water. Coldwater
Canyon is complete with lawn, shrubs, and growing trees. A large ornamental fountain in the center was illuminated with lights
of yellow, green, and purple. It was hard to realize the presence of a usually homely reservoir underneath because it
furnished such a beautiful park to the chain of parks in Beverly Hills.

PEGGY HAMILTON PRESIDES

Hon. Paul E. Schwab, Mayor of Beverly Hills, introduced the mistress of ceremonies, Miss Peggy Hamilton. She is the Los
Angeles County Official Hostess and the recognized modiste in Hollywood. She creates the styles Paris later copies. It was her
place to receive on behalf of the county the various teams during the Olympic Games. She selects the clothes the
leading screen stars wear in their productions and is a very busy woman. One of the speakers told on her
in spite of her protests and we learned that she had dressed in her car while coming from the studio.
But you never would have guessed it. She appeared in a striking cape with a lot of fall innovations which
had just been introduced as the vogue in the smart shops on West Seventh Street. She wrote on my program
afterwards, “Greetings to Jack Williams from Beverly Hills and Peggy Hamilton, County Hostess.”

THE PROGRAM

The Beverly Hill Billies performed in person through the courtesy of radio station KMPC. The team is composed of Len,
Jad, Hank, Zeke, Dan, and little Elton Britt, the boy from Arkansas, and Mr. Bud. Their radio broadcasts have been
outstanding for the last two and a half years. This was one of their rare public appearances.

Dr. Charles Frederick Lindsay, a member of the faculty at Occidental College, gave some readings. He is the far-famed dramatic
reader heard each Sunday afternoon over the Columbia Network. His feature was instructive as well as entertaining.

Ethel Jenks, who co-starred with Lawrence Tibbett in one of his recent pictures, sang. She possesses a wonderful soprano voice
and contributed a great deal to the success of the program.

Fanchon & Marco made a splendid contribution. They presented their best talent and feature act. Beverly Hills is the home
of this famous vaudeville organization. They have about 35 companies on the road all over the United States. The whole
program was staged on a platform erected in the park under the trees. A Beverly Hills orchestra furnished music for
the occasion.

WILL ROGERS ATTENDS

Will Rogers came in while everyone was seated. Throwing his hat on the grass, he sat down at a place
on the other side from the speaker’s table. Miss Hamilton called on him and he kept us howling for 30
minutes. Everywhere we went the editors had been called the “moulders of public opinion.” They had come to think that
perhaps public opinion was a little mouldy but it wasn't their fault. Will Rogers had a good laugh on editors
and public opinion, and said, “The editorial page is the one nobody reads.”

A. L. Kates of Claremore, Okla., was in the newspaper party. It seems he had taught Mrs. Rogers how to
set type in his printing shop years ago. He paid 75 cents a day as a wage, but she wouldn’t
work for less than $1.00. Will Rogers commented on the fact that “she’s still expensive.”

Speaking of politics, he claimed, “I’ve kind of lost interest in politics since Cal got out. There was a President
for you and he had a sense of humor. I liked Grace, too; in fact, I don’t know whether Cal
likes me so much on account of Grace.” He told about visiting the Coolidges at their New England place. After
supper that night Cal said, “Well, Grace, I expect we’d better send Will off to bed.” He described going upstairs
and entering a big room. In the corner was a big bed. “Bed, why it was a regular Brigham Young
bed,” he exclaimed.

He kept the polo ponies at his ranch during the Olympics and insisted that after he’d seen some of the
Holland women he thought they had made a mistake. He was supposed to keep the Holland women instead of the
horses.

In closing, he remarked, “I don’t know whether you enjoyed all this or not. I can do much better. You
know I’m not getting paid for this, but when I’m paid I put on a real performance.” It was kind
of him to come the day after Mr. Ziegfeld’s death, because the passing of this great showman was a great
blow. They were great friends and Mrs. Ziegfeld left all the arrangements in his hands. We met him after dinner
and he is a regular fellow. He politely asked where we were from and invited us to visit him at
his ranch. He was careful to add, “I won’t feed you! I thought you had come out here for a
day or two and here you are on us for two weeks, just eating your way through California.”

En route to Los Angeles we took a view of Beverly Hills’ new city hall. It was especially illuminated for
that night and it is indeed an architectural masterpiece.

Dr. Samuel J. Hume of the University of California, at Berkeley, spoke on “Oriental Relations” at the business session Tuesday
morning. He made one of the most scholarly talks of the entire convention. Alma Whitaker, of the Los Angeles Times
made a talk also. You may have your alma mater, but California has its Alma Whitaker. She was born in
England and has lived...**Wednesday, Nov. 9—Night After Night—(Paramount)**

From Louis Bromfield’s story, “Single Night,” this picture attempts to prove the theory that true love can exist even in
a speakeasy. The story is about Miss Healy (Constance Cummings) who frequents Joe Anton’s blind-tiger because it was formerly her
home. The picture is well directed by Archie Mayo and conveys the popular conception of speakeasies as sleek, disorderly, and
exciting. George Raft as Joe Anton and Roscoe Karns as his valet both play their parts very well. Constance Cummings
is attractive but not very convincing as the kind of girl who would fall for a gangster. The supporting cast
is very able.

**Thursday and Friday, Nov. 10-11—Grand Hotel—(M-G-M)**

The story, taken from the book by the same name by Vicki Baum, is laid entirely in a luxurious continental
hotel. This is probably the first picture to deal with the startling readjustments of the conflicting aims of the characters
as a result of their proximity. As it should be, the chief virtue of the picture lies not in the
brilliant direction of Edmund Goulding, but in the acting: Garbo gives, perhaps, her best performance, portraying admirably the bored ballet
dancer, Grusinskaya, and the change which comes over her. John Barrymore makes a very charming scapegrace Baron. Wallace Beery is
very realistic as a disagreeable textile tycoon, while Lionel Barrymore is one of his clerks who is incurably ill and
has come to spend his last days in a burst of unaccustomed luxury. Joan Crawford is the stenographer who is
also in love with the Baron. Other stars who played their roles capably are: Lewis Stone as a sententious doctor,
and Jean Hersholt as the hall porter. One of the best productions of the year.

**Saturday, Nov. 12—Klondike and Passport to Hell**

Klondike (Monogram) is one of the dramas of the silent days made into a talkie. True to the custom of
that time, villains are villains and virtue always gets its reward. Lyle Talbot does his best, but not to much
avail. A Passport to Hell (Fox) is a rather artificial story of a love triangle in an African settlement. Elissa
Landi is an actress whom it is difficult to suspect of misconduct; yet she is often cast in the most
dishonorable roles and this picture is no exception. Alexander Kirkland and Elissa Landi play their parts remarkably well considering the
story.

**Monday, Nov. 14—Sherlock Holmes**

Clive Brook plays with his usual ability as Sherlock Holmes in this, one of the oldest, and perhaps one of
the best of detective stories.

**French Records**

The college has recently purchased for use in the Department of French a set of twenty Victor recordings, Français par
le Son (French by Sound). The material for these records was prepared by Prof. Raymond Weeks of Columbia University, and
the recordings were made by Professor Louis Allard of Harvard. Professor Allard is a native of Paris and this new
set of records has been received very favorably by teachers of French.

**Gammon Speaks to Quadwranglers Club**

The Quadwranglers, Davidson College faculty club, held its regular monthly meeting in its club room on the third floor of
Chambers Thursday evening, November 3rd. As guest and speaker, the Reverend Edgar G. Gammon, D.D., pastor of Myers Park Presbyterian
Church of Charlotte, was presented. Dr. Gammon spoke on the problems of the pastor of a city church, giving especial
emphasis on the many outside calls which are made. After his address, Dr. Gammon replied to a large number of
questions asked by members of the club. Several new members, elected at the October meeting, were present. These included Major
Rhett, Mr. Brannon, Coaches Newton, McEver, Laird, Unger, and Whittle, Mr. McGill and Mr. Hobart. The officers of the Quadwranglers
are: President, G. B. Watts; Vice-President, H. E. Fulcher; Secretary-Treasurer, J. P. Williams. These officers together with Dr. P. H.
Gwynn make up the executive committee of the club.
