FIRST SHIPPING BOARD.
“We got this boat together in remarkably short time,” remarked Noah jubilantly, as he stood off and surveyed the ark.
“Yes,” replied Japeth. “All we had to do was to go ahead and build her of wood. There hasn't been any steel construction to stop and argue about.”—Exchange.

THE IRISH COAST.
An officer on board a warship was drilling his men.
“I want every man to lie on his back, put his legs in the air, and move them as if he were riding a bicycle,” he explained. “Now commence.”
After a short effort, one of the men stopped.
“Why have you stopped, Murphy?” asked the officer.
“If ye plaze, sir,” was the answer, “Oi'm coasting.”—Over Here.

A negro soldier in the trenches showed up with a new pair of shoes.
“Where did you get dem shoes, nigger?” asked his mate.
“I gotten des shoes from a Boche,” was the reply.
Soon after this the first negro disappeared. He was gone about four hours, but when he reappeared he, too, had a new pair of shoes.
“What kep you so long, nigger?” asked his friend.
“I had to kill twenty of dem Boches befo’ I got a pair to fit me,” he answered.

“Did ye bring home that pane of glass for the kitchen windy, Pat?”
“Oi did not. Oi was after a twilve by fourteen, and the only soize they had was fourteen by twilve.”

LITERARY SOCIETIES.
Although the work of both literary societies had to be suspended during the S. A. T. C., the work this year has been very successful. At the opening of this Spring term nearly a hundred students joined the societies and showed much interest in their work.

Eumenean Society.
In this society fifty-two new members were initiated during a very interesting and entertaining ceremony. Many left the hall shoeless and hatless, with a good excuse for “cutting” church the next morning. This large class of neophytes with those who were veteran slingers of the horned beast made up the largest society the Eus. have had in many years. Everyone entered heartily into the work of the society, especially “Bull” Liston and some of his satellites. The first contest of interest was the Fresh-Soph debate. There were seventeen entries. Of these seventeen the lucky three were Mitchell, J. C. McCaskill, and A. P. Ormond. Ormond having the gift of gab and more experienced in hollering for the cows talked away with the medal. In the finals for the Inter-Collegiate Debating Team, Flinn and Woods made the shades of Demosthenes and Cicero look on green with envy. For many weeks the halls and woods of Davidson resounded with the echoes of Freshmen and Sophomores in distress wrestling over their declamations. On February 12th everyone was relieved of these terrible sounds, when Houston White “copped” the Fresh-Soph declaimer’s medal for the Eu. Society. The past year has been one of marked improvement in the work of the members. They have entered into the contests with more zest and enthusiasm. The two lower classes are to be congratulated on their interest and from all indications the other literary society on the hill will have to push up to hold its place as the winner of trophies and medals. Although the initiation fee and dues were lowered, the large number of men taken in enables the Society to make several needed improvements. The exterior woodwork has been painted “college white” and the stairs and balustrade have been repaired. Those who guided the Society through the Spring term were Flinn, President; J. G. Richards, Vice President; J. R. Boulware, Secretary, and S. T. McCloy, Reviewer, for the session, and Woods, President; Sullivan, Vice-President; McPheeters, Secretary, and A. R. Craig, Reviewer for the last session. The officer for the first session next year will be...he Askew, President; J. R. Boulware, Vice-President; G. N. Atkinson, Secretary, and W. B. Sullivan, Reviewer. 

Philanthropic Society. The work of the Phi Society for the past term can be called successful when all the difficulties and obstacles are considered. The first term began with R. D. Hall as President. His first meeting was the occasion of initiating some forty Freshmen and five upperclassmen, who give promise of good work in the future. Due to the unsatisfactory heating of the society hall, several programs had to be cut short and were not what they should have been. During the first term, the Fresh-Soph Declaimer’s medal was awarded to A. D. Currie, ‘21. The last term, with W. M. Currie as President, was much more successful. During this term, the Phis were winners in both Inter-Society contests. In the Fresh-Soph debate, McKeithan, Dunlap, and Long were victorious over the Eus, the medal being awarded to McKeithan, '22. In the Junior-Senior debate, the Phis, represented by Alexander, Spence, and Chalmers, were also victorious over the Eus. The Alumni Debating Cup was awarded to the Phis as it was the fourth successive year the Phis had been victors over the Eus. D. M. Chalmers, ‘20, was awarded the debater’s medal. In the Inter-Collegiate debates, the Phis were represented by R. D. Hall, ‘19, E. G. Lilly, ’19, and W. M. Currie, ‘19. Currie and Lilly were victors over Washington and Lee. Much interest was shown in the Essay contest. D. M. Chalmers was decided winner with Alexander and Howell receiving honorable mention. W. F. Hall, D. W. Roberts, and D. M. Chalmers were chosen by the faculty as Junior orators. The Senior orators chosen were R. D. Hall, O. P. Hart, E. G. Lilly, and W. M. Currie. The Junior Society for new men is to be reinstated next year, thus giving all regular meetings to the Senior Society.

I DOUBT IT.

When two rosy lips are upturned to your own,
With no one to gossip about it,
Do you pray for endurance to leave them alone?
Maybe you do—but I doubt it.

When a dear little waist is in reach of your own,
With a wonderful roundness about it,
Do you argue the point 'twixt the right and the wrong?
Maybe you do—but I doubt it.

When a dear little hand you're permitted to seize,
With a velvety softness about it,
Do you think she will never permit it to squeeze?
Maybe you do—but I doubt it.

When a dear little head lies close to your own,
With its curly ringlets about it,
Do you look at your watch and say you must go?
Maybe you do—but I doubt it.

And if by these arts, you have captured a heart,
With endearing sweetness about it,
Will you guard it and keep it and act the good part?
Maybe you will—but I doubt it.

"I Doubt It." An Answer to

When a curly-headed boy, handsome and bold,
Whispers sweet nothings as his arms you enfold.
Tell others about it?
Well, maybe you do—but I doubt it.

When he tenders you candy and a trip to the show,
Suggesting an auto ride just his money to blow,
Do you think of the cost and the worry about it?
Well, maybe you do—but I doubt it.

If mussed was your hair and the waist that you wore,
If he'd asked for one kiss and taken a score,
Did you threaten to tell your mama about it?
Well, maybe you do—but I doubt it.

If a bid to the hops you had taken for granted,
And he had dragged someone else to the dance that you wanted,
Would you act just as sweet when he told you about it?
Well, maybe you do—but I doubt it.

If he spent all he made and the future looked blue,
Would you surrender your pleasures and stick like glue,
"Live on love" in a cottage with roses about it?
Well, maybe you do—but I doubt it.
—Log.

CAPTAIN J. D. McCONNELL DIES AT HOME.

The sympathy of the student body goes out to Drs. J. M. and J. W. McConnell, in the loss of their father, Captain J. D. McConnell, who died at his home in McConnellville, S. C., May 22. Captain McConnell was eighty-six years old and a distinguished veteran of the Civil War. He was one of the most prominent citizens of York County and numbered his friends by the hundreds. He was an elder in the Presbyterian church and a devoted church worker all his life.

Was "D" Club Intention Ridiculous?

New Letter Men Undergo Both Comical and Impressive Ceremony.

A rare show was exhibited on the streets of Davidson, Saturday, May 10. The first act began at 5 p.m. After its first rehearsal and a slight intermission for mess, the final performance was given for the entertainment of the "train crew" of the 7:11. The actors were this season's letter men in: Baseball—R. B. Cunningham (Mer.), Johnson, Sample, Miller, McArn; Basketball—J. D. Watt (Mgr.); Track—A. R. Craig, S. D. Brice, Finley, Sprunt, McCloud; Tennis—Hall. Upon the first outburst, this wonderful vocal band attracted such a crowd that even an experienced traffic cop as Mer. Watt was unable to keep the streets clear. "Black Buck Private" "Cop" Johnson, Acting Major, led his battalion of a single squad through many interesting maneuvers with his strictly I. D. R. command, "Candidates fo' Davidson Colig' De'club, roun' 'bout yo'selfs go!" Brass button, "Officer Miller," leading the parade, captured the heart of all the nurses in the park. Especially was this shown by the case of Mrs. Black-Cloud (colored), who followed him admiringly. After the parade, she settled down again on her wheelbarrow, nursing her "Sugar-baby Sample" on her modern nippled bottle. "Miss Mikey" Dug McArn, A. D., better known as "Caruso" and "Let us vote," removed the crowds with her soft, melodious bass tones. Miss Willifrank Hall reached the other extreme of attractiveness in her modest appeals to the passersby for the purchase of a flower. The fast (2) trio of the D.C. Track Team gave an ex-sample of their ease and grace in pacing "up and down Broadway." The winners were: SecD. Brice (from Alabama, you know), pacing Maude Finley, and Jim Sprint. On account of the dust from the race, it became necessary for Sprinkling Mr. Cunningham to sprinkle the speedway. "Two-Mile Craig, A. R. M. A.," seemed to feel (as he looked) very much at home in his "vacation togs." Slowly but surely, without moving out of the track, he awaited the result of seed and water to "fetch taters" for him to dig. These joyful candidates for a D.D. then withdrew to the gym to share their fun with the older members of the Club and—"the ceremony will be concluded at the cemetery."

MELODRAMA.

The curtain rose,
The hero saw
The heroine and
Kissed her.
The villain tried
To shoot the bride
But luckily he
Missed her,
The end he met
Was timely set,
The curtain hid the picture.

THE BETTER WAY.

"You are talking through your hat."
"Nay! Nay! Our line is shoes. We talk through those."
—Exchange.

DOUBLE "L"

Tommy (writing)—"O, Bill! 'Ow many hells in 'Oenzollern?"
Bill—"Two h'ells, same as in 'ell."
—Exchange.

A few days out, when the boat began to toss and the waves became mountainous and menacing, a seasick negro soldier looked up to the sky from where he lay on the wet deck, miserable and terrified, and groaned: "Oh, Lawd, please make dat ocean come to attenshun."

"If men do not provide, by saving, for all those dependent upon them, then they have not opened their eyes to any adequate conception of human life."—Woodrow Wilson.
