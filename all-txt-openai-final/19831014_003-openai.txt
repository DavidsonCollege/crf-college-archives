Advisory Committee To Collect Student Opinion
By DAN VOORHIS

The newly formed SGA Presidential Advisory Committee will collect student opinions on Davidson’s major issues and present them in a paper to the new College president. The committee, organized at the beginning of this term, met Wednesday for the first time to determine how to summarize student opinion. They plan to solicit informed views from various committees and organizations on campus. A letter will be sent out to these groups next week.

Committee chairman Elizabeth Brooks explained that this first step will be to “ask opinions on the things that directly affect them. This is their big shot to get their views across,” she said.

Grading Policies Vary By Professor
By ROXANNA GUILFORD

Davidson has no general College policy on grading. For the past fifteen years, College professors have set their own grading scales. “There is no numerical equivalent for [letter] grades,” said Registrar Richard Burts. But while grading remains the individual professors’ prerogative, he or she must be able to justify and document the basis of the grades issued.

According to the “Academic Regulations for 1983-84” available in the registrar’s office, students may question a grade which they feel they do not deserve. The professor in question and the department head are the first two recourses. If both of these appeals fail, students may appeal to the Dean of the Faculty. If the matter is still not resolved, it is turned over to the Executive Committee of the faculty. The appeal to the Dean of Faculty must be made within 30 days of the new term, and the executive committee’s decision is binding.

Professors’ Policies

Class participation is a factor most professors consider in determining a final grade. For French professor Lauren Yoder, “class participation is essential.”

SGA President Hunter Monroe initiated the committee to acquaint the new College president with student views before decisions had to be made. Monroe added that “once they make policy and take actions it is very hard to stop. We’re just trying to let the President know.”

Beyond simple regurgitation of facts, he looks for creativity, evidence of improvement, and an ability to conceptualize and integrate. Analytic ability is also very important to professors in the Humanities program, where essay answers provide a large part of the basis of the professor’s evaluation. Religion professor Sam Maloney explains that discussion questions are used most often in order to evaluate how well a student can integrate the information received in class. His basic theory about grades is that the student does the work, and he keeps a record. In Humanities, 15 percent of this record entails class participation. Other disciplines weigh this aspect differently, but nearly all consider it when deciding upon a final grade.

Theater and Speech professor Rupert Barber sees class contribution as “major,” figuring greatly into his evaluation of theater classes. Religion and English professors use participation as a criterion, as do some in the sciences. One Physics professor sees this as playing an important role in many of his classes, especially the smaller ones.how we feel from the start. The committee will refrain from drawing conclusions and making suggestions. According to Brooks, their job is “to bring together the variety of student opinion rather than trying to make recommendations. We're advisory in the sense of providing information for better decisions.” Brooks felt that “it would be hard for the new president, even an alumnus who left 30 years ago, to understand all the facts. We’re trying to update the president on what’s going on.” The letter the committee will send out includes a questionnaire to direct the responses. The committee will collate opinions in a first draft by the first week of next term. The final report will be on the president's desk by Christmas, whether or not a new president has been chosen. All groups will be questioned on issues such as the semester system, faculty evaluations, exam period length, campus security, self-selection, and other topics of general student interest. Also included will be questions pertaining to each particular group’s area of interest. Members of the committee are Brooks, freshman Mark Sandy, freshman Chet Barksdale, junior Warren Gould, junior Tim McGaughey, and junior John Laughlin.

Center Enriches Curriculum
By WAYNE MAGRUDER

The Center for Special Studies helps students interested in pursuing areas that exceed the confines of the regular majors. The Center allows a student to focus on broad interests into the workable objectives that constitute a major. Anyone seeking such a major can realize their wish outside regular academic channels through any combination of seminars, tutorials, internships, and experiences abroad. Center Director Professor Louis Ortmayer said, “It allows for self-design and flexibility which offers broader opportunities for exploration and application of [one’s] major.” Students interested in completing a major through the Center are asked to submit a statement of their “educational experience, interests, and accomplishments,” according to the Guidelines for Application. Students must describe the “organization of [their] program — tutorials, seminars, and independent study projects in the Center, and courses in the regular academic program.” An interview by the Center faculty follows. Students then proceed to complete a self-designed major utilizing any resources, seminars, and courses useful to them. They may even take courses offered at another institution or study and work abroad. During the senior year, they must present a senior thesis or project. Most are written, but some involve multi-media presentations. The Center, sponsor of all types of study, is especially strong in international topics such as International Political Economy or third-world journalism. Not only are the students able to continue disciplines under the Center's program, but also they can do in-depth work within a specific field. Senior Jeff Mann is one of the students benefiting from the program's flexibility. Seeking a journalism/political science major, Mann designed his own educational plan.

Many professors see evidence of improvement. This is often difficult to measure, and, as one professor points out, works better with smaller classes. Open-ended factors such as improvement and “benefit of the doubt” often make grading ambiguous. Mathematics professor Benjamin Klein finds this ambiguity less than appealing. His grading philosophy emphasizes the importance of a student knowing exactly where he stands. Advocating what he terms “unambiguity,” he adheres to a formula that allows students to know their letter grades based on their numerical test results. He admits that this tends to impose a degree of inflexibility, but he also maintains that it is only fair. While he would like to grade for improvement, Klein sees it as unfair to the consistent student. His policy is based on fairness not only relative to the individual but relative to the entire class. Perhaps Maloney best summarized the divergent philosophies when he stated that he simply “kept the record.” His assertion that “tests are a motivating factor in learning” seems to be shared by many of his colleagues as well.
