**Eleven Delicacies Create Unique Gastronomical Tales**

As is the case with any tradition, the Grim’s Run has its own folk heroes and lore. Many of the
Grim’s tales accentuate the negative aspects of the combined effects of Grim’s doughnuts, much coffee, and long hours of work
extending through the night until dawn.

Assistant Director of the College Union Duff Bruce claims to be one of the three kings of the Grim’s Run.
Bruce claims to have earned his cigarette money by making the Grim’s Run and returning to Davidson with orders from
six regular customers filled.

“I never ate a doughnut after my freshman year,” Bruce said. Bruce explained his first case of Grim’s fever, a
24-hour illness brought on by study for a political science review, an all-night study period, a gallon of coffee, and
the Grim’s doughnuts. “I’ve never been so sick in my life,” said Bruce. “The doughnuts turned on me in a
most perfidious way.”

“We used to lag pennies up against the wall while waiting for the hot doughnuts,” he explained. “We also used
to listen to the Grim Baker preach a bit, and then we would argue some of the finer points of
religion. They are the worst doughnuts you can possibly buy,” Bruce remarked. “There is simply that romantic element.”

“Grim stands for firm, you know, and I’ve been pretty firm in my beliefs over the years,” he said, leaning
over a small block of newsprint on which he was furiously figuring the cost of a dozen doughnuts, two cinnamon
buns, and a pint of lemonade.

His name is R. C. Powers. To hundreds of Davidson students, he’s the Grim Baker. The short, white-haired man, who
hurries to the back of his shop at 2 a.m. to bring out a brown sack of hot doughnuts to
a hungry Davidson student waiting out front, has been baking for over 50 years.

“I started on October 16, some year after the First World War. I've completed so many years of baking now,
I don't exactly remember which year it was I started,” Powers indicated.

Powers recalled that a baking job in Mooresville became available on the same day a job opened with the Western
Union in Winston Salem. “If I had my choice to choose a trade, I would probably be with Western Union,”
Powers admitted. “Of course, back then, the Model T was all we had, and Winston Salem was about three hours
away. The Western Union job would have meant being a long way from home, so I just stayed right here
in Mooresville,” Powers explained.

The Grim Baker has been using the same recipes to turn out his supply of doughnuts, pastries, pies, rolls, bread,
cream puffs, and eclairs since he started. “You see, we've got real good products, so we don’t have to change
recipes,” Powers seemed to have a hard time trying to determine which of his products he enjoys eating most. “Gee,
I guess doughnuts are what I like best,” he said as he removed his cap, smoothed back his thinning white
hair, and replaced what looks like a flour-covered Boy Scout hat, adjusting it until he got it just right.

“You know, those cinnamon buns are awfully good, but they’re usually not hot when I'm looking for something to eat.
But I just take a few hot doughnuts as I work along, and they sure are good,” Powers remarked.

Davidson students have not always patronized the Mooresville Bakery. “When I first opened up, I didn’t have any students as
customers,” Powers recalled. “But since the time when students were allowed to leave campus, I’ve had quite a lot of
Davidson boys here,” Powers added.

The Grim Baker has some mixed feelings about his student customers. “You want to know the truth?” he asked. “Some
of the boys are real good. But some of them are rude,” Powers said. “You can tell that some of
the boys simply haven't had that home training. And that’s what it takes, just plain training in the home. I
really love Davidson, and that’s the reason I discipline the boys. I want any businessman to do the same.”the same
with my boys,” he indicated. “I’m not their enemy; I’m their friend,” Powers emphasized. “Somebody’s got to teach some of
those boys discipline though,” he added.

The Grim Baker prefers the outward appearance of his past student customers to his contemporary clientele. “When it first came
out, I was against long hair. You know the Bible says it’s a disgrace for a man to have long
hair,” Powers said. “Paul says it’s a disgrace to a man—not a sin—a disgrace. You see when I'd say something
to the boys about it, of course it wasn’t me who condemned it; it was Paul,” explained Powers. “As long
as it’s not a sin, I don't get too critical about it,” Powers added with an accusing glance.

Powers explained that he has had to deal with some pretty rough crowds from Davidson occasionally. “You know, it really
hurt me when they decided to allow liquor on campus. Some of the boys would come up here drunk,” Powers
said. “One night, one boy called Jesus Christ a fanatic,” he admitted. “Since I learned what ‘fanatic’ means, that's not
a bad thing to call him,” Powers explained. “But that night, I thought the man was talking rough about my
savior. Well, that was a case of embarrassing myself by not being educated,” he admitted.

The Grim Baker has a lot of respect for Davidson College. “I'm not an educated man myself,” Powers admitted. “I’ve
only had an eighth-grade education, but I’ve been on the road a lot, and I try to put my experience
to good use,” he maintained. “I went to a country school, you see. I actually went until tenth grade, but
I never could've passed more than an eighth-grade exam,” he explained. “It was one of those one-room schools where we
had all the grades in one room,” he recalled. “We had to read to ourselves so it wouldn’t bother anyone
else,” Powers remembers. “When I went to teach Sunday School, I was in a place where I needed to read
out loud. I had to go learn to read all over,” he said. “I’ve been around educated people all my
life and I try to let it soak in. I still don’t talk good English,” he admitted.

There are a great many Davidson students who are most thankful that R. C. Powers didn’t finish school and take
a job with Western Union. Somehow, life at Davidson College just wouldn’t be the same without an occasional trip to
Mooresville to watch the man in white hurry up to the counter, tilt his head back slightly, give his customers
a piercing ‘look-over’ with his sharp grey eyes, and reply, “Oh, the doughnuts are still in the oven.” Eating a
warm doughnut makes the Grim’s Run worthwhile. “The only good thing about a cold Grim’s doughnut is the middle,” Bruce
commented.

Assistant to the President Rich Wilson recalled a different definition of Grim Fever from the Bruce account. “Grim Fever occurs
when you’re studying past 12 and you’re so hungry that you forget how bad the doughnuts were the last time
you ate them,” Wilson maintained. “Grim Disease is the ailment which hits you on the ride back to the campus
when all you feel is that lump in your stomach,” he emphasized. “Grim’s is synonymous with gastric upset,” said Wilson.

One of the classic Grim’s Tales occurred when Wilson took some of the freshmen on his hall to the Mooresville
Bakery. “One freshman didn’t have any change, so he wrote out a check to the Grim Baker. Powers accepted it
with no hesitation,” Wilson remembered.

Associate Director of Alumni Relations Zach Long recalls a certain mystic student organization associated with the Mooresville Bakery when he
was a student here. “Gamma Beta Kappa was the national fraternity with its only chapter located at Davidson which had
some mysterious connection with a Grim’s Baker club,” Long recalled. “You'd always go to Grim's to get doughnuts,” said Wilson,
“and you always knew it was a mistake, but Grim’s is just an irresistible campus institution,” Wilson said. “And I
swear I don’t know why,” concluded Wilson.
