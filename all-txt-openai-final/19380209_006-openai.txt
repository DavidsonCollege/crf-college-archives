Our intrepid photographer (all newspaper photographers are intrepid) while out with his nose to the ground, looking for pictures, snapped this excellent action shot of the Davidson country club, haven of local golfers. The Hungarian actress, Franciska Gaal, will make a big hit with Davidson students with her sale.

Poll Reveals Fifty Eagle Scouts in Student Body
Local Troop Celebrates Boy Scout Anniversary

There has been a recent attempt to add impetus to the Boy Scout movement in Davidson. Mimeographed questionnaire sheets were prepared by Frank Brown and Ivan Whetmore and all former scouts among the students were asked to co-operate by filling them out. The purpose of the questionnaire was to ascertain whether or not there was sufficient student interest to organize an Eagle Scout fraternity on the campus, whose goal in turn would be to further scouting in Davidson. Results of the questionnaire were: 80 wished to continue scout work, 97 in favor of an Eagle Scout fraternity, 51 had attained the rank of Eagle Scout, 34 Life Scouts, 33 Stars, 22 First Class, 27 Second Class, and 13 Tenderfoots. Hiking, camping, swimming, cooking, fire-making, and signalling were most popular. Major Steel of the R.O.T.C. department, is Scoutmaster of the town troop, while Dr. Gwynn is chairman of the Davidson scout work. Scout Anniversary Week, celebrating the 29th year since the founding of the Scouting movement, will be observed February 6-12. During this week the local troop 58 will have a banquet at the Church Sunday School room. Dr. Gwynn and Mr. J. E. Steere, scout executive of Charlotte, will address the assembled scouts.

AMERICA LAGS IN TRAINING
Miami, Fla. (ACP) — Instruction in land flying in grant colleges as a means of building up a reserve of aviators forNational emergencies were advocated before air officials here recently. “America lags in training its manpower for war in the air, if that war ever comes,” Floyd E. Evans, Michigan state director of aeronautics, said at the annual convention of the National Association of State Aviation Officials.

“Give every junior and senior in land grant colleges the opportunity, at a nominal fee, to learn to fly,” he said.

Among the Greeks (Continued from Page Five)
Marian and Bidwell Ivey were at his home in Rock Hill, S.C., for the weekend. Pinkney Stowe traveled home to Belmont, while Jim Hill went home to Sharon, S.C. Pinehurst and Cliffside, the respective homes of Henson Maples and David Colvin, were the destinations of these Mac dances. Two brothers, Lawson and Covington, went to Winston-Salem and Salem College in Greensboro.

Fijis Hold Annual Pig Dinner in Charlotte
Delta Kappa of Phi Gamma Delta held its fourteenth annual Norris Pig Dinner at the private dining room of the S&W Cafeteria in Charlotte on Saturday night in honor of its ten initiates. Harold Sugg of the class of '37 was toastmaster at the dinner; other Fiji alumni present for the festivities were John Creech, John Foster, J.B. Goslen, and Gene Vogler of Winston-Salem, and Dave Hall of Belmont. Dr. Tyler Hanes of Richmond, Va., province master, Dr. H.J. Bolin of Mascot, Tenn., purple legionnaire of Kappa Tau chapter, and Dr. W.P. Cumming of Davidson officiated at the initiation.

Mere males are invading a field which women have always dominated—that of possessing inferiority complexes. A psychiatrist at the University of California who hears the woes of students states that inferiority complexes harass 25 percent of men students entering the institution. Although we have no access to statistics, our general observation is that insanity is increasing.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR (Continued from Page 2)
It is dying a slow but obvious death that the first-year class be granted membership in the student body. We cannot rest on the laurels won by the great men in the past but must at least make an effort to progress. This letter was inspired by a talk given recently in one of the literary societies.

Yours for a better Davidson,
BORU.

NEW DANCE (Continued from Page 5)
Couples have to have cooperation between themselves, as the somewhat complicated steps and movements are essential. Timing and perfect coordination are key.

PHOTOS TO BE JUDGED (Continued from Page 1)
First prize will be a fine Eastman Kodak, and the winner will receive photographic supplies from Sapp. A display of the winning snapshots will be made in the window of the College Pharmacy, and later they will be sent to various newspapers throughout the state. Students are asked to cooperate with the College Pharmacy and The Davidsonian in this contest and submit a variety of pictures. There is no entrance fee and only one binding rule: all snapshots become the property of The Davidsonian.
