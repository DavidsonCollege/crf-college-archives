HAVE GOLF AND TENNIS TEAMS GOOD RECORDS

—: BY PERRY SLOAN :—

While most Davidson men enjoyed the spring holidays from Broadway to Tropical Park, the Wildcat athletic teams got in some valuable work for the Alma Mater. The golf and tennis squads were the most successful, each winning five matches; the baseball team followed in the Easter parade of victories with three for five.

The niblickers probably showed up best in lieu of their opposition. Led by the sharpshooting veterans, Charlie Ross and Bill Snow, and with the able assistance of young bloods Hanson Maples and Jimmy Westall, the Red and Black scorched several southern courses to establish themselves as likely contenders for both state and conference honors. They will have an opportunity to show their wares in the Eastern Intercollegiate Tourney which takes place in Augusta the latter part of this month. Lawrence “Larry” Spearman has taken over the job of coaching the shot-makers and is very popular with them.

It is strange to notice that the only non-coached sport in our curriculum enjoys about the best record in the won and lost column each year. Despite this disadvantage, Wildcat racquet teams are well respected among their opponents. Doubtlessly, they seek the advice and pointers of a former coach of the championship Big Ten Michigan teams who is now located in Charlotte. Plans for such action are immature at present, but should they come through, netters who really take their game seriously would be attracted to Davidson.

BOWLING GAINS FAVOR

We noticed the popularity of bowling to be growing with those who have recently had idle hours to spend in Charlotte. Since there are no alleys (bowling) nearby, the fascination of laying into the wooden triangle for strikes, spares, or just for the sheer joy of seeing the pins drop comes only to those who trek over to Charlotte. It so happens that several Charlotte alleys operate bowling leagues and some of the campus bowlers have suggested that an interfrat pin league be formed to function on idle weekends. This is not as far-flung as it may sound as similar circuits operate in other schools. All frats or independents interested in this proposition should contact your lodge sports manager.

Another suggestion brought to our attention is the formation of competitive teams involving the faculty in pool, ping-pong, and golf. This column seems to be a clearing house for such brainstorms; why not put some of them to a test?

HARD OR SOFT BALL?

The question will soon arise so prepare your arguments pro or con. Heretofore the frat tourney has been decided the “man’s” way, but softball seems to be gaining followers each season. We prefer to keep it so and leave the diamond ball to be played among the class teams. The softball took a terrible beating the first day and if swatting the cover off a ball is any indication, the campus will enjoy a banner season.

Duke Team Rallies to Take First Encounter; Second Game Walk-Away

ERRORS PROVE COSTLY

Davidson Takes Three of Five Games on Trip

The Davidson baseball team dropped both engagements of a two-game series with Duke’s Conference-leading Blue Devils last weekend by scores of 16-11 and 29-4.

In the initial game, Wildcat batsmen hopped on Dave Smith's deliveries in the first inning to score three runs and then bunched their hits again in the third to put across two more counters and assume a commanding 5-0 lead. Capitalizing on Davidson errors, Duke cut this lead each inning until they forged ahead in the sixth and then maintained the lead for the remainder of the game, despite a desperate Wildcat rally in the ninth.

J. D. Hicks was the outstanding star of Friday's game. Besides turning in a stellar exhibition on the mound, he hammered out a double and a triple to drive in four runs. Hicks’ superior mound work was offset by a temporary blow-up of the Wildcat nine in the sixth inning, however, which allowed six runners to cross the plate. Russ Bergman, Duke’s shortstop, led the Devils at the plate, driving in six runs while garnering a single, double, and home run to boost his own batting average. Bergman's home run came in the ninth inning with two men on base.

In Saturday's encounter, the Duke batters went on a scoring spree which netted 24 hits from three Davidson pitchers; 61 Duke men came to the plate during the game. Eddie Steere started on the mound for the Wildcats. His steaming fastball fooled the Dukes momentarily; but when they had learned to judge the speed, he was nicked for several hits. Fielding Clark went in in the fourth inning. He was followed by Herman Yearwood who finished the game. Barley and Watson worked in the box for the Blue Devils. Eric Tipton led the hitting with four hits out of six trips to the plate while Ambler and Gaddy each scored a home run along with two other hits. Captain Quick was the only Davidson batsman to register more than one single.

On an extended trip during the spring holidays, the Davidson nine met several of the better teams in the south, winning three games and losing the majority. Hicks and Steere did the pitching for the Wildcats. The scores of the games were as follows: Davidson 9—Wofford 4; Davidson 3—Oglethorpe 2; Davidson 8—Oglethorpe 0; Davidson 6—Erskine 4; Davidson 1—Presbyterian 5.

PRO LEAGUERS TRAINING HARD

Yankees and Giants Rule as Favorites in Pennant Predictions

With the spring training grind rapidly drawing to a close, Yankees and Giants, last year’s champions, still rule as favorites in their respective leagues. The Yankees, with such stars as Lou Gehrig and Joe DiMaggio signed on the dotted line, are quoted at almost even odds to take the American flag, while the Giants are rated only a fraction higher than the St. Louis Cardinals.

In the American League, the Detroit Tigers are rated to have a chance with the Yanks if their star first baseman, Hank Greenberg, returns to old form. The Cleveland Indians are, as usual, rated among the top-notchers, while the Chicago White Sox, last year’s surprise package, are rated as a dark horse. If the Boston “Golden” Sox can iron out their “too-many-stars” situation, they will be in there battling to the last.

In the National, the race appears to be much wider open. With the Cardinals and Giants rated as tops, the other clubs all seem to have a chance. The Chicago Cubs will be strong as usual, while the Cincinnati Reds with their hustling young club will furnish plenty of opposition for any of the others. The Pittsburgh Pirates are said to be stronger than last year's first division team.
