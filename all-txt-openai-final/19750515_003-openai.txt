The Davidsonian

Three Workshops spark off-campus experiences

By CHARLIE SHEPHERD

Two Life-Experience Planning Workshops were conducted by the Experiential Program Office in April; these workshops mark the beginning of an
important new thrust for experiential learning experiences at Davidson. Director of Experiential Learning Ken Wood explained the reason for the
workshops. “They were begun in response to a problem that seemed to appear as students came down and wanted to
have an off-campus experience, but weren’t sure how it fit into their lives.”

Wood contacted Dr. Edward Golden, a friend he met at Princeton Seminary, to direct the workshops. Golden received his PhD
from Columbia University and works with a group called Organizational Renewal Associates. When Wood contacted Golden, he discovered that Golden
was a graduate from Davidson in the class of 1947.

Two groups participated in the workshops held at Erwin Lodge on two weekends in April—the freshman class of North Carolina
Fellows and a later group of interested students. Also, a number of administrators and faculty participated, including Dean of Students
Will H. Terry, Professor of Religion Sam D. Maloney, Professor of Economics Randall R. Kincaid, Professor of Psychology John D.
Kelton, and Secretary of Experiential Programs Suzie Summers.

Golden sent three tests for participants to take before the workshops began. These were scored and placed in the participants'
hands during the workshops.

Personality tests

The tests were geared “not so much to find problems as they were to find strengths,” according to Wood. In
addition to data from the tests, participants generated data about themselves in other areas; by the end of this data
gathering stage, they had explored about 15 areas, including ideas concerning personality, needs, roles, values, interests, types of vocational preference,
talents, traits, ambitions, options, and norms. These data largely were indications about how participants saw themselves rather than how they
were viewed by others.

Wood explained, “It was helpful for them to know whether they were introverts or extroverts (in their own eyes).” “All
this data was then massaged,” he continued. “It gave a student a clearer sense of who he is. It was
really surprising to me to find how liberating it was for the students,” Wood added.

The self-evaluations and the group discussions of them gave each participant a chance to view himself from a new angle.
He or she could gain a clearer understanding of his character, talents, and goals by projecting them off of other
people. Also, the workshop gave participants a chance to realize similar talents, questions, problems, and goals in fellow participants.

Mr. Golden’s methods

Terry commented about his experiences in the workshop, “In light of my own previous experiences and the experiences of some
students, I liked particularly the way Mr. Golden and perhaps his method interpreted the tests.” The dean of students added
that the workshop was based on the positive, stressing strengths instead of weaknesses. Terry concluded that such a procedure helps
people be less defensive about being tested and therefore allows the tests to be more useful to them.

Because of the success of these workshops, Wood plans to sponsor them regularly in the future. “We plan to offer
this kind of thing at least once each term,” he said. The workshops will be optional, but Wood thinks that
an intensive program for freshmen and sophomores would be particularly worthwhile.

“It’s our philosophy down here (in the Experiential Programs Office in Chambers) that students ought to grasp and maintain initiative
(in selecting vocational experiences).”

Needs and wants

“They should be helped by the college to know enough about themselves and their world so that they can pursue
what they want and what they need,” Wood commented. “I see this kind of self-analysis leading to carefully planned off-campus
experiences.”he added.

### Interests in Woodworking

Students who participated in the first two workshops found them to be valuable experiences. Wood said that the freshmen and
sophomores especially thought that the workshops came at a crucial time in their lives. Participants agreed that the workshops should
be made available to other students.

### Effective Planning

Terry believes that the workshops provide a means for students to plan their years at Davidson more effectively and to
receive help with their own vocational struggles. Both Wood and Terry think that the workshops are just as potentially useful
for faculty members and administrators as they are for students. Wood commented, “I think that this may be the kind
of thing that would enhance the total functioning of the College.” He had asked faculty and administrators to participate initially
so that they could help with future workshops, but he believes that the program can be valuable on a personal
level also.

### Long-Range Planning Committee

Terry commented, “It was successful for me personally; it gave me some insights into myself. I just sat there and
felt that if more faculty and particularly administrators could get the benefit of the personality inventory, we could be more
helpful to one another in our strengths.” Terry added that workshops like the life experience planning program would be valuable
for task-oriented groups. He mentioned the Long-Range Planning Committee as an example. Wood plans to meet once a term with
the participants of the initial two workshops in order to track their progress, reassess life plans, and to help them
constantly make new projections about their needs.

### Connors Accepts Post in Development Office

Mark Connors fills new office: Assistant to the Vice President for Development.

There is a new office on campus and graduating senior Mark Connors has been selected to fill it. The office,
Assistant to the Vice President for Development, has no stringent prerequisites but does necessitate a general ability to write, an
interest in staying around Davidson, and a tolerance for some detailed and seemingly trivial work. Vice President for Development Craven
Williams told Connors that the job would include him in the preparation component of the three-component development program. This will
involve basic research and writing funding proposals for the college. The three components include solicitation, acknowledgment on the job, and
preparation.

Connors, a psychology major, had applied to the now-filled position of Assistant to the President. “The day I heard I
was turned down (as assistant to the president) I heard about this job,” remarked Connors. The office was created by
Williams and finalized through the office of the President of the College, Samuel R. Spencer Jr. “I feel very comfortable
doing that sort of work (administrative),” commented Connors, who has worked with the president and Dean of Students Will H.
Terry. He has also worked as a hall counselor and freshman advisor. Connors is excited about this position but “nebulous”
about its ramifications. He feels that this will be cleared up as his role in the office is determined.

Unlike the office of Assistant to the President, this office is a permanent position. The Assistant to the President’s office
traditionally changes every year. The office would also involve extensive travel for preparing the press and “marketing.” Connors, who heard
of his selection to this office approximately a month ago, will assume the position on July first. His stay is
at this point indefinite, but he would like to stay at least three to four years. “I really like him
(Williams),” Connors said and added that he will be a good man to work for. Connors has an interest in
pursuing a career in college administration.
