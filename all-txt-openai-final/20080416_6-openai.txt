In many ways, the Spring 2008 Dance Ensemble was like all those preceding it. Dancers wore a variety of exciting costumes, stage lights magnified the mood and movements of the dance, audience members screamed out cheers for individual dancers and most of all, the dancers demonstrated hours of practice. However, one thing that made this year’s show particularly incredible was the creativity of the choreographers.

The show started with Sufjan Stevens' pensive rendition of “Chicago,” choreographed by Cristina Wilson. Dancers floated across the stage as the words echoed “All things go, all things go...” Next, “Flamenco Nuevo,” choreographed by Elizabeth Grundstein, rendered a more festive atmosphere, using “A Dios le Pido” by the Colombian songwriter, Juanes. Dancers in grunge apparel heated it up in the piece entitled “Money,” which featured songs “Money in the Bank” by Swizz Beatz, “Blue Magic” by Jay-Z, “Ching-a-Ling” by Missy Elliot and “Shawty Get Loose” by Lil Mama. The dance was choreographed by Minh Nguyen, Seyi Ayorinde and Shaina Reid.

Then the Swing and Salsa Club came out with “Rueda de Casino Salsa,” choreographed by Jessica Gallegos, who chose the song “Valio la Pena” by Marc Anthony. One great demonstration of choreography was David Dennis, Shantay Mobley, Craig Pickett and Erica Wallace’s “Shades of Brown.” They organized 29 dancers in a dance inspired by Superman, fittingly performed to the MIMS song “Superman” as well as “Kryptonite” by Big Boi and “Crank Dat” by Soulja Boy. The “Black Betty Remix,” choreographed by Susan Hudson, was a rather eclectic splash of rock and country. Dancers wore cowboy hats and jived to the country beat of “Honky Tonk Badonkadonk” and the rock music of “Black Betty.”

Harper Addison and Amanda Kuker danced melancholically to “Corner of Your Heart,” by Ingrid Michaelson. “I’ve Got Rhythm” was a delicious combination of sensuality and skill. In fancy evening attire, men and women performed an advanced and provocative foxtrot. Virginia P. Boone and Cristina Wilson. The group danced to “The Queen and I” by the hip-hop band Gym Class Heroes and “The Seed 2.0” by The Roots. “Preview: the After Party,” choreographed by Josh Hamlet and Darcie Draudt, used the rap songs, “Candy” by Snoop Dogg, “Tell Me When To Go” by E-40, “Get At Ya” by Chris Brown, and “Tambourine” by Eve. The large group of 34 dancers appeared to dance in a more natural style, which looked like it was really just a party on stage.

Probably the most entertaining choreography was Jordi Baron, Mike Parsons and Philip Ruzycki’s “Kiss Kiss,” which started Act Two with a bang, when the audience watched a quasi-music video of Davidson College life including a Chambers hallway, the library and Patterson Court. Next was “Autumn Leaves,” choreographed and danced by Shaina Reid. Then Tatenda Musapatike choreographed a dance to “Release,” by Timbaland ft. Justin Timberlake. “Cell Block Tango” packed a punch of sensuality and violence. The song comes from the movie “Chicago,” while the dance was choreographed by Amanda Kuker. Carlos Ortiz and Elizabeth Grundstein, from the Swing and Salsa Club, choreographed and performed a dance to “Todo Tiene Su Final” by Marc Anthony. Then for some jazz, Josiah Rich and his group of dancers choreographed “Cut n’ Run” by Gordon Goodwin’s Big Phat Band.

“Breakfast at Triveni’s” showed off modern Indian music, dance and dress in a piece featuring “Aaja Nachle” and “Dhoom Tana,” and choreographed by Nafisa Isa and Vaidehi Trivedi. Next, the Gamut Dance Company built a graceful, quiet dance around the piece “Prospectors’ Quartet” by Jonny Greenwood. Alice Frimpong, Nafisa Isaand Sonia Huang choreographed “Toy Soldiers: Inspired by the Tragedy of Child Soldiering.” The dance used five songs by the artist M.I.A., capitalizing on the band’s eclectic style. Stephanie Vertongen choreographed “Gone Again,” which featured seven dancers across the stage with smooth determination to the song “Gotta Get Through This” by Daniel Bedingfield. The second to last dance was titled “Anyone Can Dance Like A Jackson,” choreographed by Shantay Mobley and Erica Wallace. The dance used Michael Jackson’s “Ghosts,” “Remember the Time,” “Beat It,” and Janet Jackson’s “If.” Finally, seniors Harper Addison, David Dennis, Amanda Kuker, and Mike Parsons choreographed the Senior Dance and finale, which used the songs “School Spirit Skit #1” by Kanye West, “Send Me On My Way” by Rusted Root, “Just Wanna Dance” by Dabe Cook, “Shake Your Pom Pom” by Missy Elliot, “Sensual Seduction” by Snoop Dogg, and “Rollout” by Ludacris. The seniors got a final applause and the rest of the ensemble came back on stage for one last dance.

Flying Biscuit offers homestyle crowd-pleasers
By CAROLINE Woop Ants and Living Editrix

When it comes to enjoying breakfast all day, Charlotte’s options are plentiful but dubious. Cracker Barrel is greasy, Bob Evans no longer appealing, and Waffle House is really only palatable after a certain hour of the night. Private diners are even worse; visit Liberty East Restaurant and you'll probably be too distracted by the seedy atmosphere and shadowy monetary exchanges to worry about the brown tint of your eggs.

The Flying Biscuit Cafe has arrived to change all that. This funky, creative eatery has been delighting Atlantans since 1994, when Indigo Girls singer/songwriter Emily Saliers co-founded the original location in sunny Candler Park. Since then, the restaurant has opened five additional locations and has been featured in The New York Times as well as such magazines as Gourmet and Bon Appetit. Charlotte’s Flying Biscuit venue opened last October on Rea Road near Matthews; housed in a vast shopping center complex, the sterile, cold restaurant simply can’t do justice to the quaint homeliness of its menu. The atmosphere certainly makes an effort, but it feels hopelessly forced: brightly colored walls in green, blue, and orange, festively bedecked tablecloths, and even hand-painted sugar bowls can’t seem to fill the empty, isolated space. The bizarre music, a strained attempt at carefree eclecticism, only makes the experience more foreign and trippy.

The food, however, is the real deal. Breakfast options range from organic oatmeal pancakes with homemade peach compote to hearty farm-style breakfasts of omelettes, toast, grits, and collard greens. Hungry visitors crowd the Flying Biscuit for breakfast all day. Although breakfast is doubtlessly the cafe’s shining star, the rest of the menu is certainly worth checking out. Tasty oven-fried chicken, turkey meatloaf, and Coca-Cola glazed salmon offer a slightly healthier twist on Southern staples, and quesadillas and veggie burgers promise to please even the most suspicious conventional eaters. Be sure to try the Pudge: creamy, garlicky olive-oil mashed potatoes at least as delicious as any you’ve had at a restaurant. Vegetarian and vegan-loving, the menu offers substitutes like Soysage and tofu for any dish and gets creative with feature entrees like black bean “Love Cakes,” a tofu and potato salad with feta cheese and red onions, and a Vegan BBQ burrito.

One of the best things about The Flying Biscuit’s fare is the chef’s liberal, fun finishing touches. Basil, sundried tomatoes, goat cheese, and rosemary grace the menu and add spunk to already flavorful dishes. Although some plates seemed unfinished, like a salad of bare greens with vinaigrette (not a crouton or additional vegetable in sight), most are boldly and tastily garnished. Rooted in southern tradition, The Flying Biscuit isn’t afraid to take risks updating classic favorites. Fried green tomatoes are topped with goat cheese and an unusual honey-jalapeno-cashew filling, a courageous move most diners see as either genius or heresy. And of course, everything is served with a biscuit. Celebrated for its legendary namesake, The Flying Biscuit promises to deliver one of the best biscuits you’ve ever had, a lofty, airy concoction four inches high and crusted with sugar. Though certainly impressive, it’s starchy, cloying, and a bit tacky and doesn’t taste quite as good as it looks. But after the endless drive to get it, you’ll probably be too hungry to care.
