**See Need For Student Involvement**

A new image for the Senate based on positive accomplishments.

“The major issues we need to confront include reshaping the environment at Davidson through a permanent commitment to psychological counseling, and with that, an ongoing program, and concern for protection of student rights, including due process,” said Munce. “We also need to address the ongoing problems of student housing, laundry, food services, the college union, and the social system.

“Further, we need to increase the benefits of student association, for example, through supporting the National Student Association and the National Student Lobby in their efforts to increase federal benefits to students, making legal counsel more available, and providing better services such as calculator rental, insurance, and travel programs.

“We need to move to a greater consideration of coed dorms, including coed dorms for freshmen, actively pushing for stabilization of the size of the student body until housing can be provided. We must designate construction of new housing as a top priority for the college, and students must play significant roles in these decisions.”

Munce also expressed concern about the present laundry operations and college food services. “We need to make the move to a voluntary laundry with increased self-service and a complete re-evaluation of the kinds of service the laundry offers.

“I’m also concerned about the limited alternatives to eating on Patterson Court or at ARA Slater. We need to make kitchen facilities available to students.

“We must also better integrate the new food services to be offered at the new college union with present facilities than has been thus far planned,” Munce maintained.

Munce also felt the need for better programming by the college union and expressed concern for added improvements to the new college union facility. “We need to support what is presently underway in the construction of the new college union and make continued evaluation of the adequacy of the new facility. Of particular concern is office space, the game room, and the promotion of informal gatherings on a continuing basis.

“I think the new college...

**Senate Hears Pleas**

...spoke to the Senate on the recent self-study report. The report is required every 10 years for accreditation and it covers a wide range of subjects concerning Davidson. Proctor stated that student assistance was solicited because: “We felt that it should be a community enterprise, with students involved, not just the faculty.”

Next Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday a committee will visit Davidson to talk to students, faculty, and administrative personnel to complete the study. Proctor added that, “the final report is a condensation of earlier drafts.” In the report, recommendations are made for the future. The last report resulted in major changes, including the construction of the E.H. Little Library and a major change in the curriculum. Copies of the new report are on reserve in the library.

Guthrie presented that they visited several churches in the area requesting assistance on the survey and have received some support. Grey House has also offered 14 people to work on the survey.

Junior Tom Knouss reported that the Outing Club now has 52 members and has...Already held a seminar on rock climbing. Discounts on camping equipment bought through the Outing Club are available to members of the Davidson community. The Outing Club has also started an Explorers’ series and is continuing to buy equipment. He added that the $400 the SGA appropriated last year for the Outing Club has been helpful in getting needed equipment. He said that the union building mandates that there be a strong increase in the number and the variety of social programs sponsored by the union as well as increased cultural experiences. The temporary union has too often been used as a substitute excuse affecting program decisions,” Munce added. “We also need to come to some resolution of the limitations on the number of organizations on Patterson Court and the problems of integrating off-campus fraternities. With a continued commitment to the self-selection method because it has worked and because even with a student body of 1300, a rush method puts unnecessary strain on cohesion in the system, we must work toward expanding Patterson Court as well as union programming,” Munce said.

Munce was never supportive of student government under current SGA President Blain Butner, but had some strong criticisms of the present Senate and government processes. “Blain has succeeded in running a solid administration. He has developed rapports based on respect with the faculty, administration, and Board of Trustees, and he has committed countless hours to simply talking with students about work they’re doing or encouraging them to take on some project. His administration has also seen SGA funding of a psychological counselor, efforts to define student rights, and efforts to protect due process. However, in the past, the SGA president has not sufficiently recognized or reprimanded those people who have or have not accomplished the duties with which they were charged,” Munce maintained.

“The failures of the Senate are involved in that it has no firm conception of its role, and it tends to flounder in trivial matters. It is plagued by the same restrictions on the time, energy, and interest of its members as is any other body. The first tends to be a problem in any meeting and can be alleviated by a firmer grasp by senators of what’s going on and a firmer commitment to stick to the agenda,” said Munce. Munce feels that through closer coordination of people charged with responsibility, utilization of non-Senate members in working toward resolution of problems, and by constant evaluation of progress to ensure that the work is being done, the student government can overcome the myth of its impotence and work toward positive changes in life at Davidson.
