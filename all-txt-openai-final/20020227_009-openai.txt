**DAVIDSONIAN**

As the 2002 Winter Olympic Games brought hockey to the sports forefront for a storied two-week run, droves of Davidson
students came out of the woodwork to support what, more often than not, is an unheard-of sport in the South.
Although the games came to a disappointing close with the United States’ men’s and women’s teams losing gold medal games
to Canada, there is still hope for Davidson’s hockey faithful just down the road in Charlotte.

While the NHL has made its way to North Carolina by way of the Carolina Hurricanes, making the trip to
Raleigh just doesn’t fit into the busy schedules of Davidson students. A more feasible solution for the limited time and
funds of college students is a trip to Cricket Arena to see the East Coast Hockey League’s hard-hitting Charlotte Checkers.
An affiliate of the AHL’s Hartford Wolfpack and the NHL’s New York Rangers, the Checkers club is a breeding ground
for some of the best young talent in the country. Most players on the team range from 21 to 24
years old, and their energy and desire make for an aggressive game night in and night out.

Currently resting comfortably in second place in the ECHL’s Northeast division, the Checkers have been led this year by the
outstanding play of center Brandon Dietrich, who currently sits atop the stats list for 2001-2002 with 27 goals and 36
assists. Having amassed a 31-15-9 record on the year, the Checkers are poised to make another run deep into the
ECHL playoffs.

This is minor league hockey in its quintessential form. For a relatively cheap price (tickets start at $7) you get
to experience up close all the sights and sounds that make going to a hockey game exciting. You really haven’t
experienced hockey until you’ve been to a game in person and experienced the crack of a stick on a puck,
the thunder of a check into the boards, and the ear-splitting drone of the horn after the home team scores
a goal. While, for the upscale fan, they offer a $19 rink-side ticket with food and drink service to your
seat, a Checkers game is by no means a high-class affair. That is, however, just as it should be.

Minor league hockey is absolutely perfect in its defining lack of perfection. These are young players trying to grind out
a name for themselves with aggressive play and hustle, making sure never to back down from a fight. The crowd
is decidedly informal and rowdy as well. Secure in their distinction as the league’s leading beer distributor, the Checkers take
great pride in an unruly crowd that hails from all walks of life. Heckling is not only permitted but is
greatly encouraged in a clearly fan-oriented environment. Checkers games are made for college students looking for a cheap and fun
night out. With frequent free t-shirt giveaways and contests between periods like the longest drive and the infamous human puck,
it is everything you’d expect from a hard-hitting, penalty-ridden minor league hockey game.

**Golf team opens ’02 season**

The golf team swung themselves into disappointment last week at their first tournament of 2002, but still managed a top
ten finish. Six Davidson golfers competed at Coosaw Creek Country Club in Charleston on February 18 and 19 against sixteen
other teams, including Elon University, Loyola University, and The Citadel. As a team, Davidson finished tenth out of 17 teams
with a score of 615—307 the first day, 308 the second. Senior captain Dan Carlson and Dan Koernke ’05 tied
each other for Davidson’s low finishes of 28th overall. Other finishes include Ben Friedell ’03 at the 47th spot, and
Joe Zimmerman and PJ Martin tying for 57th.

Charleston Southern University, host of the tournament, won with a total score of 575, edging out East Tennessee State and
Elon, who tied for second with 585. Despite the disappointing finish, junior Ben “Happy” Friedell says, “We now have something
to work with. We have a feel of where we stand, what we need to improve on, and what we
need to do to get better.” PJ Martin ’04 said about the performance, “We came into the CSU tournament with
the goal of finishing top 5. After the first day, we knew we could have played better and we were
disillusioned with the amount of shots we gave away. Since we understand we did not play to our potential, we
are looking towards the future tournaments to improve.”

Davidson’s young team boasts 10 solid golfers, including five freshmen: Joe Zimmerman of Morgantown, WV; Dan Walker of University Park,
MD; Dan Koernke of Grand Rapids, MI; Jeff Hamilton of Belmont, MA; and Peyton Gallagher of Charlotte, NC. Coach Tim
Straub, a 1998 US Open qualifier and now into his second year as head coach, is leading the team.team into
six more tournaments this season. On March 4-5, the team travels to Rock Hill, S.C. to compete in the Winthrop
Spring Invitational at Waterford Golf Club. While the team is gearing up for that, their most challenging tournament will likely
be the Birkdale Invitational on March 16 and 17, of which Davidson is the host. As always, the real test
of the season will be the Southern Conference Championship at the Furman University Golf Course on April 19-21.

Women’s tennis improves to stay unbeaten

“Everything in moderation...except winning.” Junior captain Yasamina Hilu’s words have become the mantra for Davidson’s women’s tennis team. Jumping out
to an impressive 7-0 start on the season, the only thing the Wildcats know how to do is win. After
spending a weekend in the nation’s capital, the 'Cats have proved themselves tough competition for any team. Head coach Caroline
Price commented, “This is one of the best seasons; the only season that comes closer is the 1984 national championship
team, but I don’t even think they started out with this many wins.”

Beginning with the Friday afternoon competition on February 22, the Wildcats shut out the Georgetown Hoyas to earn their fifth
victory and fourth shutout of the season. The Wildcats earned their first point of the afternoon in doubles action as
each pair knocked out their Hoya opponent. Freshmen twins Meghan and Kelly Fillnow pulled out an 8-3 victory over Georgetown’s
Marshall and Kammerer, while freshman Meggie Patterson and sophomore Katherine Hatch crushed Bartell and Snow, 8-1. Hilu and senior captain
Kelly Cantrell rounded out the third spot with an 8-6 win over Botjer and Ghia.

In singles, the Wildcats outplayed their opponents to win 72-16 in total matches. Kelly Fillnow downed Liora Gelblum in two
matches, 6-2, 6-2, while Patterson beat Liddy Bartell, 6-2, 6-0. In the third spot, Meghan Fillnow overcame Jordan Botjer, 6-0,
6-2, while Cantrell shut out Trina Snow, 6-0, 6-0. Hilu pulled out a big win over Caroline Marshall, 6-2, 6-3,
while Hatch, rounding out the six spot, took care of Lara Madonia, 6-2, 6-1.

The Wildcats were back in action on Saturday, taking on the Colonials of George Washington and finishing the afternoon with
another win, 5-2. Davidson won the doubles point again with three victories. Fillnow and Fillnow defeated First and Wei, 8-4,
while Patterson and Hatch beat Gencsoy and Stastny by the same score. Cantrell and Hilu ended the doubles action with
an 8-2 win over Bode and Fisher.

In singles, Kelly Fillnow brought home another win, defeating George Washington’s Lindy First in two of three matches, 6-7, 6-4,
6-4. Davidson lost in the two and three spots, as the Colonials’ Nazli Gencsoy defeated Patterson, 6-4, 6-3, and Tracy
Wei defeated Davidson’s Meghan Fillnow, 7-6, 6-2. However, Davidson pulled out three wins in the last singles matchups, as Cantrell
crushed Natasha Bode, 6-3, 6-1, and Hilu defeated Katarina Stastny, 6-4, 6-2. Hatch finished the afternoon with a 6-2, 6-1
win over George Washington’s Samantha Fisher.

The Wildcats did not get a rest as they were back on the courts Sunday to take on American University
in their closest match of the season. After a slow start in the doubles competition, the Wildcats rallied to take
the competition 4-3. The doubles matches all ended with disappointing 8-4 losses. American’s Martin and Georgieva defeated Fillnow and Fillnow,
while Mikhailovic and Riusech defeated Patterson and Hatch. Carter and Zerkalova ended the sweep with a win against Hilu and
Cantrell.

During singles action, Hilu brought home an early win in the five spot with a 3-0 ret- inj over Lauren
Martin. Martin had to leave the court after a suspected ankle injury and Hilu was awarded the win. However, the
Wildcats would not hold onto their tie for long. American’s Olga Mikhailovic pulled out a 6-4, 6-1 win over Patterson
in the two spot while Kristina Georgieva defeated Hatch, 6-3, 6-4 in the six spot. Down 3-1 going into the
fourth singles match, the pressure was on for the Wildcats. Kelly Fillnow defeated Alexsandra Zerkalova, 3-6, 6-1, 7-4 in the
one spot while Cantrell defeated Kealy Carter, 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 in the four spot. Tied 3-3, Meghan Fillnow brought home
the impressive fourth win, defeating Lourdes, 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 in the three spot to win the competition.

Cantrell, commenting on the win, remarked, “It was a tougher match today, definitely, as it’s the first time we lost
the doubles point, but we came back in the singles.” Not only were the Wildcats impressed with their performance, but
other coaches were as well. Explained Price, “All the head coaches said basically the same thing: ‘Your team plays with
heart, resolve, and smart tennis.’”

The Wildcats’ resolve continues as they take on the Pirates of East Carolina University on Wednesday, February 27 on their
home courts. The match is slated to begin at 4:00 p.m.
