Athletic News Football Gleanings Bright Bits of Football Dope

THIS SATURDAY’S SCHEDULE:
Davidson vs. Washington and Lee, at Lexington.
North Carolina vs. Yale, at New Haven.
Clemson vs. Georgia Tech, at Atlanta.
Richmond College vs. V. P. I., at Blacksburg.
South Carolina vs. Georgia, at Athens.
William and Mary vs. V. M. I., at Lexington.
Wofford vs. Furman, at Greenville.
Vanderbilt vs. Tennessee, at Nashville.
Virginia vs. Harvard.
West Virginia vs. Pittsburgh, at Pittsburgh.

The scores Saturday indicate that it is either too hot for college football or else the big teams have not
been put in good shape. Out of the forty or more games played in the South and East, only two
went above fifty points. West Virginia beat Westminster 55-0 and Pennsylvania beat P. M. C. 54-0. Both of these teams
are just opening their season and naturally had very light opponents.

North Carolina State suffered a terrible defeat at the hands of the Navy. Although they took with them what was
considered to be a formidable line-up, the Navy piled up seven touchdowns. The North Carolinians were not able to put
across a single first down during the entire game. This should not be considered too much as an indication of
weakness on the part of the losers, as the Navy this year has one of the strongest teams in the
country.

The University of Virginia again disappointed its supporters by failing to score on the Richmond College Spiders. At the first
of the season, the Spiders had only one letter man around which to build a team. Virginia had two good
chances to score but failed to make the necessary gains. Just before the game ended, the Spiders made two first
downs and were gaining consistently when the whistle blew, the game ending with the ball in their possession on Virginia's
twenty-yard line.

One interesting factor in Saturday's games was the comparatively poor showing made by the teams we face this season. With
the exception of Washington and Lee, who beat Randolph-Macon 21-0, none of them put up their best brand of ball.
South Carolina beat Erskine only 6-0, Georgia Tech beat Wake Forest less than we did, and N. C. State was
walloped by the Navy.

Georgia Tech staged a rather unusual feature by pulling off a double-header Saturday. In the first game, they beat the
Camp Gordon team 48-0. The soldiers’ line averaged two hundred pounds and they depended on line bucks for their gains.
Injuries, however, prevented them from making any headway. Their second game was somewhat of a disappointment, Wake Forest holding them
to two touchdowns. Judy Horton, the big fullback, made both of these scores.

The University of Georgia opened their season with Citadel Saturday, defeating them 28-0. The lighter Citadel eleven was able to
hold until the fourth quarter when they became worn out and allowed the Red and Black four touchdowns. This is
the first game Georgia has played since before the war.

Auburn has a new linesman very fittingly named Sizemore, who, it is said, weighs 285 pounds. It is also claimed
that this young giant has this corpulence well distributed over his anatomy and is not at all slow. If all
this is true, we should hear more from Mr. Sizemore before this season is over.

Outside of the game in Lexington, about the biggest thing in football this week is the West Virginia-Pittsburgh game. Coach
Warner has been preparing for this game since early in September and has some new plays which he expects to
uncork at that time. With their twenty-seven letter men back, West Virginia hopes to defeat the champions or at least
hold them to a close score.

INTER-DORMITORY BASKETBALL SCHEDULE ANNOUNCED.
Mr. Miles has formed a series of basketball games between the dormitories, to stimulate dormitory spirit and to give every

ARE WE GOING TO SEE THE A. & E. GAME?—I'LL SAY WE ARE.
The game with A. & E. is to be played in Charlotte on November 8. Every man on the hill
may as well begin to save his pennies, for everyone...must be at the game. By that time the band will
probably be in shape to turn out in good style and the other students must help back the team. Plans
are under way to get the whole student body down on the eleven-fifty and back again that night on a
special train. Manager Hall says that he is planning a big parade through the principal streets of Charlotte to get
up interest just before the game. In the afternoon everything will move toward the field where the last act is
to take place. Look out, A. and E.

MOTHER.

Jest a sittin’ by th’ fireplace,
In th’s warm light’s cheery glow,
En a watchin’ dreams en visions
In th’ firelight, come en go.

Oh, th’ joy th’ dreams kin bring ye!
Oh th’ hopes we dare not name!
As we sit thru magic hours
Seeing pictures etched in flame.

When I’m feelin’ sorter weary,
Sorter pine fer sympathy,
Then I see my truest friend
A-lookin’ frum th’ flames at me.

Eyes so tender like en lovin’,
With a message pure en clear,
Send my worries all a humpin’
En plumb fill me up with cheer.

Face thet's kinder lined with wrinkles
Caused by worries not her own;
‘Cause th’ cares thet tumble on me
Air never born by me alone.

Hair thet’s jest a lettle silver
Shows th’ sterling o’ th’ heart
Thet hez been my guidin’ Angel
Since my life fust made its start.

Lips that sorter smile approvin’
When I'm sailin’ right along;
En thet droop in grief en sorrer
When I go a leetle wrong.

It’s th’ face o’ one I'm lovin’
Like I’m lovin’ nary other;
Cause I'm lookin’, en I’m dreamin’,
En I'm longin’ fer—my Mother.
