WEDNESDAY, MAY 13, 1936

The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good. Prov. 15:3.

THE DAVIDSONIAN extends sincerest sympathy to the family and friends of Bryan Ritchie and joins in mourning his untimely loss.

Paragraphics...

At this time of year, it is customary for most college papers to offer a mournful editorial eulogizing the departing
seniors. We feel that anything we might have to say on this subject has already been said far more capably
than we might hope to say it. So let's dispense with the customary ball and join in wishing the soon-to-be
graduates every success in life, while striving to make next year for the college the most eventful one in her
history.

Retiring Editor...

It would not be well to close the school year without a word for our retiring editor, LAMONT BROWN. Modest
and self-effacing, he has in his quiet, effective way done much to make this a better paper. He brought recognition
to the college as president of the N.C.C.P.A. The new seven-column pages, and that handsome new typeface for heads were
his innovations. Here’s luck, Lamont! It's been a pleasure to work with you!

Distressed Seniors...

Next year, it is our understanding, seniors will be compelled to attend the Sunday evening vespers held in Chambers’ auditorium.
Compelled is a rather strong word and we use it advisedly. Perhaps “required” would sound better in some ears. It
is not our purpose here to enter that controversy about the merits or values of compulsory vs. voluntary church attendance,
a discussion which antedates the beginnings of this publication by several years, and which has brought the editors of more
than one student effort to grief. The Davidsonian does not necessarily endorse either side of this issue, nor is it
the one here involved. But in view of the fact that at least half of the present student body is
not Presbyterian, we feel that seniors at least should be permitted to attend the church of their choice. Besides, with
good roads and ease and rapidity of modern transportation, a yearly increasing number of undergraduates spend their weekends at home.
Most of these students come from Christian families and would, and do, attend divine services at home. Yet, under the
present system, no credit is allowed for this attendance, and many who live nearby are forced to return hours earlier,
travel on the Sabbath day to be back at school in time for this evening service. The American nation as
a whole has always opposed restriction, and the right to worship as one pleased was one of the basic ones
on which our country was founded. To again require seniors to sit in assigned seats represents a distinct loss of
senior privilege. We agree with the writer who in “Campus Comments” last week voiced an opinion that the members of
this class, at least, are mature enough to realize the values of religion and have reached the age where observance
under compulsion will not make them good. The services this year have been of a caliber such as to arouse
and hold wide student interest. The college and the Y.M.C.A. are to be congratulated on making such inspirational meetings possible.
The large number of seniors who have attended voluntarily adds to our contention that all who are on campus and
would attend anyway. A feeling of restraint would probably lessen the value for those who would attend for that reason
alone. To assign seats and place monitors over them appears to be a reflection on the integrity of the rising
senior class. In other words, our Centennials can’t be trusted to check on themselves as have others in the past!

Cornelia Shaw...

This year brings the retirement of one of Davidson’s truest and most loyal friends, Miss Cornelia Shaw, who has served
the college with unfailing devotion for nearly thirty years. It is next to impossible for us to realize in the
crowded pace of a modern campus just what she has meant to the school in those trying times before the
World War and the bleak period just after the burning of old Chambers. For fourteen years, 1907 to 1921, she
filled the posts of both librarian and registrar, filled them capably and well. Her complete and carefully authenticated “Davidson College”
is an outstanding contribution to the history of the institution and the state. For many years Miss Shaw took an
active interest in all student affairs. She furnished invaluable assistance to The Davidsonian during its early years and has always
been courteous and helpful to the members of its staff. Until the great increase in size, she knew every member
of the student body on sight and showed a remarkable memory for names. Perhaps sometimes she has found it rather
hard to accept the uncouth manners of our post-war generation and misunderstandings have arisen; but at heart there is no
one more devoted to the interests of Davidson and every student. It is so easy in an editorial of this
nature to wax maudlin, to launch forth with extravagant untruths. Therefore it is with some hesitation we offer this sincere
tribute to one who has “given without stint of her time and talent” for the betterment of our alma mater.
If we have erred, it has been on the side of a too, too modest appraisal of her service to
the college.

Et tu Brute...

From time to time in the past we have editorially urged freshmen to be more diligent in speaking to those
whom they meet on the campus. However, it has recently been brought to our attention that freshmen are not the
only ones who fail to uphold this campus tradition. Nothing is more disconcerting, more like a dash of cold water
in the face, than to have one’s pleasant “Good morning!” or cordial “Gentlemen!” returned with a haughty stare or completely
ignored. Yet some of our upperclassmen are frequently guilty of this mild snobbery. We have even noticed an occasional lapse
on the part of our newly elected student body officers. Fortunately, such lapses and exceptions to the rule are few
and far between. But the friendly custom of speaking to one another is one of the major features in our
campus atmosphere. It is worth effort at preservation. Hence this reminder.

Remember the Alma Mater

In a few short weeks, we will be scattered to our homes or resorts for the summer vacation. But let
us take with us the thought of our Centennial Building Program and all that it implies. Many of us will
be able to personally contact alumni and owners who can contribute materially to the success of this program. Use these
opportunities to best advantage! Not only will the added prestige of the school mean much to us as alumni, but
it will make our college a pleasanter place to live while we are here!

QUOTABLE QUOTES
(By Associated Collegiate Press)

“Football develops that type of man who asks nothing more than to fight his own battle in life.” Maj. John
J. Griffith, Big Ten Commissioner of Athletics, defends the college game.

“Spend leap year on the farm if you're a bachelor, and want to stay that way,” says Prof. E. T.
Hill of the University of Illinois. He explains that there are fewer unmarried women in rural districts.

“I marvel at the gentlemanly ways that have been discovered of being dishonest.” Chicago's Robert M. Hutchins discovers that honesty
is no longer considered smart.

“A reach had.” I know. A middle-aged individual has less chance to reach the age of eighty than his grandparents.
So says Dr. Alexis Carrel, who ought to know.

DAVIDSON OFF THE RECORD
HAROLD SUGG

Airy Philosophers, Mere Whittlers of Wood

A note of mild wonderment rings in the mind of our monastically accustomed student at the effusive burst of girls
that appears in town these late spring nights, especially on Saturday night. So long accustomed to mere boys and a
campus only sparsely diversified by a few co-eds, the eye takes notice at the sudden presto-chango. What brands Davidson as
a village is not its size, its stoplight or its blue laws—or its absence of sanitary inspection of dairies and
boarding houses—but the way its denizens make the legal “U” turn at the 5 & 10 corner. Despite the pastoral
sang-froid and the stolid nonchalance, they all do it with a guilty conscience. Once in a while a semi-city slicker
will slither around and nearly break an arm straightening out, but most of the inhabitants start from the bottom of
the wheel and sheepishly push it around.

History Repeats But Not Orally

Once more to be visited upon us, like the recurrent plagues of Egypt, is a five (5) day rushing season.
This was tried in '35 and reaped its harvest of hate and almost unanimous condemnation. Proposed again for '36 it
was vigorously protested and rushing season was returned to decent length. But now quietly, for characteristically, there has been no
public announcement, the awful road is laid out for us again. We suggest that rushing season be dispensed with and
the freshmen be allotted according to a crap game by the Pan-Hellenic Council (new racket, boys). That 115 freshmen can
choose successfully from 9 environments in 5 days is a pitiful**Pecsuniption, May the best Liar win.**

Every Rose Has Its Thorn And it's an ill wind that blows no good. In two such simple adages does
columnist view the WALKER evacuation of the senior class from Beour bulwarks, carrying with them one J. Megalomaniac Walker who
feebly misquotes the classics for want of originality. Walker wildly blurbs vacuous “rants wildly” like phrases, the sum of which
he calls philosophy. To what use he plans to put his wild ranting we don't know. We suggest that he
go on the “March of Time" Program and stooge as the discontented mob.

**Languid Richards**

An air of secretiveness surrounds the recent Y.M.C.A. Cabinet houseparty but from the circles, limps and staggering signs one would
think they had been off on a ten-day knitting party. The only concrete evidences we can uncover is that Walker
was presented a cup for being a Casanova, that “Rough-House” Glass was sober, and that by calling it a “deputation”
they had their cuts excused. There were others. The Kappa Alpha order betook themselves to Roaring Gap where Tom Downie,
who has been getting that way faster and faster, fell head over heels that way then. J. C. Crowell who
was last seen “nigger-dancing” at the Bowery took up square dancing and Gil Palmer and Marshall Sanford were all wet.
The Phi Delta Theta boys went to the Power Lake near Statesville but all evidences point to a quiet time,
such as the Betas and Pikas had further back in the weekend. As for the SAE's, read on.

**Campus Comments**

On June second some one hundred and twenty students will graduate from Davidson. Of this number a larger proportion will
enter the business world than will go into any other occupational field. At any rate a larger proportion will enter
this field eventually if not immediately. Every year the situation is the same. The most important courses to these students
are economics, business administration, and political science. As a result these classes are selected by these men in their junior
and senior years, causing a consequential overcrowding in each subject. As it is now we have one professor teaching each
of these subjects. To be sure they are most efficient, but they are handicapped by the size and the number
of classes they teach. Each one teaches from three to five different courses with more than one class in some
of these. This seems an undue burden to cast upon them and expect the best results. An efficient instructor, preferably
two, could be added to the faculty and alleviate the load on their shoulders. Due to the homogeneity of business
administration, economics, and political science one man could teach in at least two of these branches. It is rumored that
another man is to be added in the department of music for next year. It is not my aim to
criticize music. It certainly has a place in a liberal arts education, and our musical organization has brought credit to
the institution. But it does not seem so important to add another man to our music staff when we need
a man so badly in the aforementioned fields.

**OPEN FORUM**

Editor Davidsonian:

I am appreciative of the efforts of the student body to arouse interest in the need for a new Infirmary.
This need has been apparent to all and has been embodied in my annual report to the Trustees for the
past fifteen years. No student has suffered from lack of attention while we have been using the old building, for
we have good general hospitals within fifteen or thirty minutes reach, but during cold weather those who had to stay
in bed in the Infirmary have been uncomfortable at times due to poor heating.

Student health service for colleges and universities has changed somewhat in the past twenty years. Our present plan is to
spend more energy on preventive medicine, and to place the student in contact with a competent surgeon or consultant immediately.
Even our wealthy universities pursue this plan, for no longer is major surgical work done in college infirmaries. The parents
prefer their sons to be in a modern general hospital, so the college infirmary should be a center for health
service and well equipped for general diagnostic study.

The ideal is to have bed capacity for 3% of the student body thus an institution of 1000 students should
have 35 beds. The staff should consist of the Director of Student Health Service, an assistant who should be a
trained technician for laboratory and X-ray work. A Psychologist from the College Faculty should be on the consulting staff, for
mental ills are as real as physical ones. The examining and treatment rooms should be modern with equipment for Physiotherapy—such
as ultra-violet lamps, diathermy, etc., since a large part of student practice consists of injuries to limbs and joints.

It might interest your readers to know that Davidson was one of the first colleges in the U.S. to give
complete physical examinations to all students, and to require typhoid inoculation as well as smallpox vaccination. Your writer gave the
first typhoid vaccine ever administered in this State in 1908. Together with the administration we have studied plans for a
modern infirmary. The entire set-up for student health service has been comparatively a recent development in all colleges. We consider
the University of Michigan as having made the most recent improvements in this line. Experience has proven that an entirely
free service is not to be desired and that it defeats its own end. The department is overburdened with needless
examinations, visits and details when all services are free. Of course, all accident and emergency cases should be entirely free,
but where a student enters college with a permanent or chronic defect there is no reason that all treatment should
be free to him.

John W. MacConnell, M.D., Director Student Health Service.

From Davidsonians of Years Gone By

**Five Years Ago**

Last Friday the grey but proud heads of the Davidson faculty were forced to bow themselves in defeat as the
Senior Class baseball nine administered them a 17-11 licking. Casting aside all decorum and classroom restraint, the faculty donned old
clothes and though appearing to be holding a Bowery Ball of its own, presented one of the most exciting games
of the season. Cries of “Pitch to ‘em, C.K.!” “smack out, Ernie!” “atta way, Dutch (Lengeveld)!” rent the air. C.K.
Brown, (Dr. to you, sir) pitched a fine brand of ball up to the seventh inning when the old soup
bone obviously weakened, and he was replaced by Captain Pritchett.

**Ten Years Ago**

Soph Day, the end of Freshman tribulations, will take place Saturday. Special regulations in regard to dress and proper conduct
will be enforced, and the time will be called each minute of the day from every dormitory on the campus.
A list of the schedule of time-callers will be posted on the bulletin board. The cap burning ceremony will come
just after the show Saturday night. Freshmen will be required to march to the athletic field for the ceremonies. Freshmen
will wear yellow slickers, carry books in a suitcase, stand at attention upon entering the room of an upper-classman, and
other regulations which are being formed by the sophomore committee.
