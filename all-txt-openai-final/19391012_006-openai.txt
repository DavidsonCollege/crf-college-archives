Alpha Epsilon Delta met in regular session Friday at 5 o'clock. Programs for the ensuing year was the chief topic of discussion. After the Constitution and by-laws were read to the members, a program committee, Charles Sherman, Chairman; Walter Fitzgerald, and Bill Martin—was appointed. It was decided that on October 20, all members of the student body who were interested in medicine would be invited to the meeting. The speaker for this has not yet been secured.

"College Years", a new monthly magazine, has recently joined the journals which cater to the collegiate taste. This new publication, similar in many respects to others already on the news racks, is different from them in that it features more literary value, collegiate taste, and student opinion instead of the usual run of jokes and cartoons. It has more short stories, articles, and fashion notes than the others. Also, it is meant to satisfy the tastes of both male and female collegians.

Featured in this, its first issue, is an article by Don Herold on "I May Be Crazy, but Here's How I Would be a Professor." This connoisseur of taste advocates teaching the college man to stand up straight, to dance, and other revolutionary ideas.

Several pages of fashion plates illustrate notes on "The Sweater Girl", for the femmes, and "College Clothes Are Sensible," for the men.

PHILIPPINE ECONOMIST Scorns Isolationists

Mr. Villamin asserted that the majority of Philippine sentiment is against receiving absolute independence in the next five years, as called for by present Congressional legislation. Scorning the fears of isolationists who believe that foreign possessions will involve the United States in war, Mr. Villamin explained that the mere presence of the American flag in the Philippines is a sufficient guarantee against aggression. The United States, he explained, enjoys the unparalleled respect of other nations in Asia, and neither Japan nor any other country has ever attempted to dispute American authority in the islands. When independence comes, and the United States will, in effect, hand over a treasure chest of vast undeveloped resources to Japan, or a period of chaos will ensue.

LOCAL POETS

Paul Crane, of the Junior class, has received the following invitation: "You are a special guest at the annual meeting of the Poetry Society of America, to be held on Monday, October 16, at 8:00 P. M. in the Grand Ballroom of the Hotel Astor, New York City. The meeting will be followed by a reception and dance."

[Continued from Page Three]gents. The past two years, came to David- son a group of poets with whose work I am familiar, or who have been highly recommended by a lib- rary. Also present among other articles is one on this year’s outstanding football captains, three short stories, several cartoons, and a few jokes. This new journal will be published eight times, once per month, during the school year. It may be found at Hugo Sapp's news rack.

I am extending this personal invitation to submit a manuscript for consideration for our forthcoming volume, “The Yearbook of Modern Poetry—1939.”

Plans for the annual homecoming celebration at Davidson Unity Church were made last Saturday at the regular meeting of the students. The date was set at November 11-12. Returning students will find a different Davidson, which seems to have prospered during the summer, as new houses appear here and there, despite the current war.

New Boarding House
At last, Mr. Sam Thompson has found a way to keep the students from walking across his lot at the corner of Concord and Woodlawn streets. A spacious new boarding house now stands where last year a well-beaten path ran. This new white building is the proud boarding house of the Kappa Alpha and Phi Kappa Phi fraternities.

As one travels farther out Concord Road, he sees the new home of an insurance agent. On the formerly deserted corner of Thompson and Lorimer streets stands the residence of Dr. W. J. Martin, President Emeritus of Davidson College. Approaching town, we see a new bungalow, occupying the place where for a number of years stood the Old Smith Boarding house, which burned to the ground several years ago. The building which housed students last year and was then known as “Mooney’s,” has been remodeled and is now the home of Mr. P. B. Peyton.

High School
The local high school has also been remodeled and looks more like a fashionable school on the inside than a high school. This finishes the biggest building program that the local town has seen in a number of years.

V.M.I. BEATS CATS
The Davidson Wildcats were stopped by the Keydets’ line. Davidson kicked to the Flying Squadron's 39-yard line. Led by Catlett and Shu, the Keydets moved up to the Cat's 20-yard line. For the Flying Squadron, the work of Nelson, Catlett, Tipton, and Shelby was outstanding. The Wildcats were routed to the tune of 40-0, with Villanova backs consistently circling the Carolina ends.

Watchman Named
Chief Ed Linker, former head of the Davidson, N.C. police force, has recently resigned his position to become nightwatchman on the Davidson College Campus. When it was announced that Mr. James Johnston had resigned as nightwatchman, a number of applications for the job came in. Mr. Linker was selected.
