#### R.O.T.C. Training May Be Abolished in School By: Presbyterian Synod

**Dr. Lingle, President of the College, Withholds Personal Views Regarding the Matter**

**COMMITTEE SELECTED**

**Trustees and Committee of Synod to Debate Matter**

The Presbyterian Synod of North Carolina has appointed a committee to confer with Davidson College Trustees regarding the advisability of
taking steps to abolish R.O.T.C. in the college. The following statement, embracing his knowledge of the matter, was issued by
President Walter L. Lingle of Davidson College.

"I left Rocky Mount, where the Synod was in session, for Richmond before this discussion on the R.O.T.C. came up,
so I have no personal knowledge of what was said or done. I see in the newspapers that the Synod
appointed a committee to advise with the Trustees on this question. As Davidson College belongs to the Presbyterians of North
Carolina I think that it is perfectly proper for the Synod to appoint a Committee to confer with us on
any phase of our work here.

"Inasmuch as such a Committee has been appointed, I think that the friends of the college will recognize at once
that the proper time for me to express any opinions that I may now have, or may form, on this
subject will be when the Trustees and the Synod’s Committee meet to study the question. I have not seen any
report as to the number or the personnel of this Committee."

The agitation of this question is of national scope, and especially in schools of Christian character. In colleges where military
training is a compulsory part of the curriculum, the college authorities are constantly harassed with the problem of assigning classes
in military tactics to students who come from homes where a knowledge of militarism is deemed unessential, and even objectionable.

It cannot be said, however, that the movement has been given impetus so largely by college officials. On the contrary,
people unconnected with the educational institutions except as relations to students have led the agitation against the R.O.T.C. The movement
on foot will be given support by peace agitators whose exhortations are widely promulgated throughout the land. The question is
to be debated by the Committee of the Synod and the Trustees of the College at a future meeting.

Augustus Leazer, ’11, has been appointed operations manager of the new Curtiss Flying Service airport in Raleigh. Since leaving Davidson
several months ago Mr. Leazer has been chief pilot and chief instructor of the flying school.

#### Eleven Freshmen Out For Manager

Eleven freshmen have reported to Ernest McCall, Business Manager of the Davidsonian, for work on the paper. These men are
in line for a position as Solicitor in their sophomore year, which will authorize them to seek advertisers. Their most
important task in the first year, however, is the sending of subscription copies to outsiders.

The freshmen who have reported to the Business Manager are: Parks, Mebane, Brown P., Guerrant, Caldwell, McConnell, Daniel, Falls, Morrow,
Manson, and Whitted. Members who retain positions on the present staff are: E. H. McCall, Business Manager, J. A. Cannon,
Assistant, L. L. Boyd, Subscription Manager, and the following Solicitors: A. J. Baker, P. M. Conway, J. H. McKinnon, J.
O. Mann, J. E. Russ, and J. L. Sevier.

W. H. Neal, ’17, former cashier of the Charlotte National Bank, is now located in Winston-Salem, where he is one
of the vice-presidents of the Wachovia Bank and Trust Company.

#### Team Entertained at Alumni Banquet

One of the high spots of the recent trip of Davidson College’s football team was the informal dinner given by
Dr. A. B. Reese, alumnus of this institution, who entertained in honor of the Wildcats, who that day had staged
a battle against obstacles that was comforting to the several hundred former students of the college in attendance. The dinner
was given at the University club, corner of Fifty-fourth St. and Fifth Avenue. The team, escorted by police all the
way from West Point to the club, arrived about 8:30 p.m., and the dinner started a half-hour later. No set
program had been arranged, but when Dr. Reese, presiding, threw the meeting open for any remarks that wanted to be
voluntarily made, three of the guests present responded with brief talks.

Capt. Thad Brock extended his appreciation, on behalf of the entire team, to Dr. Reese for so honoring them. W.
P. Anderson, ’07, as president of the New York Alumni Association, voiced an appreciation on behalf of all Davidson alumni
in New York for the splendid fight that the Davidson team had made at West Point that afternoon, and likewise
thanked Dr. Reese for entertaining the boys. Capt. Norton G. Pritchett, Davidson’s director of athletics, spoke for a few minutes,
officially representing the college in giving expression to his appreciation of Dr. Reese’s courtesy.

At the conclusion of the dinner, Dr. Reese presented an entertainer from New York, who held the attention of the
crowd for an hour or more, performing many kinds of tricks, the solution of which was not discernible to any
of those at the dinner. In addition to the team, the two coaches and the four managers, others attending were
J. A. Cannon, ’04, Concord; Dr. Oren Moore, ’08, Charlotte; Lawrence Wilkinson, ’13, (Continued on Page 7)

#### Henderlite Defines “A Man” at Vespers

Dr. J. H. Henderlite, pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Gastonia, delivered a very interesting and profitable talk to
the students at the regular Sunday evening Vesper Service, October 13. Dr. Henderlite is head of the Stewardship Committee of
the Presbyterian Synod of North Carolina, and is on the committee appointed to formulate plans for the erection of the
new Presbyterian Church at Davidson.

The speaker based his talk upon the words of the first verse of the fifth chapter of Jeremiah: “Run ye
to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places thereof,
if ye can find a man, if there be any that executeth judgment, that seeketh the truth; and I will
pardon it.” Following are some of the helpful thoughts brought out by Dr. Henderlite:

“The Lord told Jeremiah to go out in the streets of Jerusalem and look for a man who was real
and true enough to know the righteousness of God, and one who loved God to such an extent, so that
Jerusalem could be saved from destruction. What are the marks by which you can recognize a real man? The first
consideration is whether or not a man has a clear conscience. If a man has his conscience well regulated and
in tune with the heart of God, then he is safe and is right with God. It makes a great
deal of difference whether you are doing right in your life. When all things are running together, honesty is always
the best policy. A man who will follow his conscience will always be right with God. Follow your conscience if
you want to be a true man. An honest man is the noblest work of God.

“The second consideration when you go out to look for a real man is whether or not he has a
heart. By this we mean warm feelings and strong affections. A man without a heart is incomplete. When Jesus looked
upon the needy multitude, He was filled with compassion. A man has a heart if he has love for his
home—love for his family and his friends.

“Another thing one must think of in his search for a man is whether or not he has a mind.
A real man is going to use his mind (Continued on Page 7)

#### Dr. Sam Glasgow

Knoxville Pastor who will conduct the fall series of evangelistic talks

#### Prominent Pastor Will Conduct Fall Y.M.C.A Evangelistic Work Here

**Dr. Glasgow Rated by “Who’s Who in America” as a Leading Minister**

**CONFERENCE LEADER**

**Has Written Several Well-Known Books**

In choosing a man to conduct the Fall evangelistic services the Y.M.C.A. officials tried to obtain one whose personality, character,
and achievements would appeal especially to college men. They happily found the man whom they sought in the person of
Dr. Samuel M. Glasgow, brother of Mr. Tom Glasgow, of Charlotte, well known to Davidson men.

Dr. Glasgow has held as his pastorate for several years past the First Presbyterian Church, Knoxville, Tennessee, the oldest and
one of the largest churches in that city. Dr. Glasgow has always held young people as his chief interest. He
has for several years been the leading spirit of the North Carolina young people’s conference held on the Davidson campus
each June which is attended by five hundred boys and girls of the preparatory from all over the state.

“Who’s Who in America” rates Dr. Glasgow among itsList of the foremost ministers of the United States. From that publication,
we find that he is an author of note, having written on a wide range of subjects. He contributes the
program for the Young People’s Societies in the Christian Observer each week and is a prolific writer for all the
church publications. He has also written many hymns and poems. Dr. Glasgow is a graduate of Washington and Lee, at
which institution he was a member of the Phi Gamma Delta social fraternity. He attended Union Theological Seminary where he
received the distinction of being the Hogue Fellow. His ministry opened on the Mexican border where he was a missionary
for four years. From there he accepted a place on the teaching force of the Austin seminary. Later he became
pastor of the Breams Memorial Church of Charleston, W. Va., from whence he moved to Knoxville, where he has been
for the past nine years. This is the first time during his service there that the session has granted him
leave of absence during the rush season of early fall. The session of that church believed Davidson to be such
a rich field of service that it readily granted him permission to hold the fall services.

C. M. Robinson, ’10, of Lowell; Fred L. Smyre, 1900, of Gastonia, and Chas. A. Cannon, of Concord, are vice-presidents
of the Gaston County Textile Manufacturers Association. Mr. Cannon is also third vice-president of the North Carolina Association of Cotton
Manufacturers.

Y.M.C.A. Plans Big Party For Weekend

As the time draws near for the big Citadel party, which is to be held this weekend, more and more
forms of entertainment are being planned for the students and visitors by the committee in charge of the program. This
committee, headed by W. B. McGavock, has arranged a program, in conjunction with the Red and Black Masquers, the Queens
College Glee Club, and the Davidson Y.M.C.A., which will occupy every moment during the entire weekend. From the plans already
arranged, this promises to be the biggest social event of the entire fall, with, perhaps, the exception of Homecoming.

Saturday afternoon, the Davidson-Citadel football game starts the weekend off. The game, which is to be played on Richardson Field,
promises to be one of the best of the season. During the game, the bands of the two schools will
play. Between halves, one hundred cadets will give an exhibition of the way they drill at the Citadel.

The entertainment of the evening begins at 7:15 and will be held in the auditorium of Chambers. First comes a
one-act play, “Copy,” presented by the Red and Black Masquers. This is a “peppy” story of newspaper life in which
a hard-boiled editor exhibits the stuff that newspaper men are made of. Next on the program for the evening comes
a recital by the Queens College Glee Club. The club contains about forty beautiful members, and the concert promises to
be exceedingly good. The Glee Club features Miss Martha Dulin in a number of vocal selections. Following the entertainment in
the auditorium...

Trousers Donated to Davidson Band

Ask any man which part of his wearing apparel he can least do without and he will mention that part
of his wearing apparel from his waist down—pants. The most aggressive and heroic of men are handicapped without pants. If
you want to test this statement, try going to a social function without them. A man would become a social
outcast before he got in the front door.

The College Band has had no pants in the past, although they have had striking headgear and shirts. Their handicap
has been great. Their mortification has been intense when they have played at football games before the “Queens” and other
fair spectators. The situation has affected the music, it has affected the marching, and, most of all, the noticeable lack
of proper wearing apparel has affected their peace of mind.

Now this has all been changed. A good friend of Davidson saw the need at the Clemson-Davidson game and, being
a modest man himself, he felt for the band. When he arrived within reach of his trusty checkbook after the
game, he immediately wrote out a perfectly good piece of negotiable paper which directed that his bank pay to the
College Band the amount of two hundred dollars. The only “string” to the gift was that his name be withheld—another
instance of his modesty.

Arrangements are being made for having the trousers arrive in time for Homecoming Day. According to information at hand, these
trousers will be black with a broad red stripe down the leg. The appearance of the band will be greatly
improved with this added equipment and it will no longer be necessary for our band to sit in the stands
while visiting bands parade the field between halves in full regalia. Such a condition has existed in the past on
several occasions, our band feeling that their showing in the field, due to a lack of proper uniforms, would not
be creditable. The last donation, with the money raised by the faculty and student body, completed the band uniform with
the exception of the purchase of coats. For the present, at least, this item of uniform will be eliminated. Because
of the desire of the donor of the...

Davidson College Church Approved by N.C. Synod At Its Recent Session

Committee, Headed by Dr. Raynal, Reports Present Building Altogether Inadequate

COMMITTEE FORMED

Estimated Cost, Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars

The Synod of North Carolina, in session at Rocky Mount last week, after hearing a report by Dr. C. E.
Raynal of Statesville, chairman of a committee appointed to investigate the church conditions at Davidson, adopted without a dissenting voice
the report of the committee which advised a new church for Davidson.

A year ago, the Synod appointed a committee, of which Dr. C. E. Raynal was chairman, to study the church
problem at Davidson, and to advise what should be done. At the meeting of the Synod last week, this committee
made a splendid report, and recommended that a committee be appointed to take up the whole question of raising funds
and erecting a new church. The Synod requested that the committee work in cooperation with the session of the local
church and the faculty of the college.

Dr. Raynal’s committee reported, in part, that the present church was inadequate in heating and ventilation system, was uncomfortable, and
was entirely out of keeping with the other architectural surroundings. Reaching the conclusion that the church was the most inadequate
building on the campus, the committee further recommended that the new building be “substantial and beautiful; that it be in
keeping with new Davidson architectural standards; and that its auditorium and Sunday School equipment be adequate.”

While no figures or plans have been adopted yet, and probably will not be for a considerable time, it is
estimated that approximately $250,000 will be expended in building the new church.

Dr. Walter L. Lingle, President of Davidson College, is heartily in favor of the movement. In voicing his personal feelings,
he says: “I am in hearty sympathy with the movement to build a new church at Davidson. I think it
would mean much to the students and the faculty. I am deeply interested in all that concerns the spiritual interests
of both groups. It takes only a glance at the present church and its inadequacy to show that it is
highly desirable that we should build a new one.”

The committee appointed to have charge of raising funds, etc., in building the church, consists of the following: Rev. C.
E. Raynal, Statesville; A. S. Johnson, Charlotte; D. Clay Lilly, Winston-Salem; J. H. Henderlite, Gastonia; and Elders R. A. Dunn,
Charlotte; C. M. Norfleet, Winston-Salem; C. A. Cannon, Concord; J. Lee Robinson, Gastonia...

Honorary Frats Bid On November First

The first day of November was set as Bid Day for the honorary fraternities of the campus by the Honorary
Fraternity Council at a meeting last Tuesday, according to E. H. McCall, president of the council. This is a much
later date than last year when it was held October 11. This, however, is due to the fact that several
of the fraternities have not held their first meetings of the year yet, and have made no plans for the
year’s work.

Those honorary fraternities who will extend bids November 1 are: Alpha Phi Epsilon, oratory and debating; Omega Phi Alpha, philosophical
and psychological; Gamma Sigma Epsilon, chemical; Sigma Upsilon, literary; International Relations Club, national organization; Scabbard and Blade, military; Delta Pi
Kappa, journalistic; Sigma Pi Sigma, physics; Biology Club; Eta Sigma Phi, classical literature; Mu Beta Psi, musical; Sigma Delta Psi,
athletic. The Tap Day of Omicron Delta Kappa, a fraternity recognizing leadership, will probably be set at another date.
