The swimming and diving team took on Duke in a dual meet on the ’Cats’ Senior Day at Davidson’s Cannon
Natatorium.

Unfortunately, the meet did not end well for the ’Cats, who fell to Duke on both the men’s and women’s
sides.

The men lost to the Blue Devils 140-94, while the women were defeated 155-79.

Davidson paired two seniors with younger teammates to bring home wins in both the men’s 400 free relay and the
women’s 400 free relay events.

In the 400 free relay, Fiete Stegger ’08, Brad Poole ’06, Steve Tolson ’06, and Miguel Rodriguez ’09 took home
first place.

Stegger also placed ahead of the competition in the 200 free with a time of 1:46.49.

The team of Scott Frantz ’09, Tolson, Poole, and Adam Secrest ’06 placed second in the 400 medley relay.

Will Broughton ’08 won the 1000 and 500 races with times of 9:45.17 and 4:45.44, respectively, while Rob Broughton ’08
placed first in the 200 fly with a 2:00.44.

On the women’s side, Alana Ream ’09 won the women’s 1000 free with 10:34.62.

Megan Hollar ’06, Kristen Shields ’06, Kirsten Allen ’08, and Jessica Totten ’09 finished the meet with a win in
the 400 free relay.

Because it was the last home meet, the team honored seniors Secrest, Tolson, Poole, Hollar, and Shields.

“It is hard to believe that it has been four years. It was really nice to see friends and family
in the stands supporting all of the seniors in our last home meet,” said Hollar.

The team returns to the water on Friday at Radford to compete against VMI.

Seniors Brad Poole, Megan Hollar, Adam Secrest, Kristen Shields, and Steve Tolson competed in their last home meet on Jan.
14th.
