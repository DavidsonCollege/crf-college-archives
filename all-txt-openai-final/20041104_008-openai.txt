**Creative Type: Kate Minogue, Davidson’s Coffeehouse Songstress**

By Brian Creech

Talented coffeehouse songstress Kate Minogue ’05 has taken a careful and deliberate route to becoming a solo performer. As a
devoted lover of music, the Baltimore native began playing the flute in the fifth grade at age 10. She continues
to play flute in the Davidson College Orchestra.

The slightly adventurous and the very lucky have sometimes been able to see Kate and her guitar playing soulful, folksy
ballads on stage at Main Street’s Summit Coffee—where she also works tending the coffee bar—or at one of the Union’s
“Open Mic” nights.

Kate began working at the guitar in earnest after arriving at Davidson College. Though she had spent some time from
the age of 14 dabbling with the guitar and piano, and her dad would play guitar or piano songs around
the house while Kate was growing up, she truly began performing guitar songs on her freshman hall, building up courage
and falling in love with the instrument.

Singing, though, was a different endeavor almost entirely. Kate knew that if she wanted to perform, she would have to
build up the courage to sing. To counteract this fear, she auditioned for and joined the Davidson College Concert Choir.
After getting around the initial trepidation of singing, Kate now has an almost compulsive tendency to sing and perform. She
credits her desire to sing and her love of music for helping her get around any of the nerves that
may have stopped her before.

From her first open mic, at the beginning of her sophomore year, Kate distinctly recalls the sheer enjoyment of sharing
music with other people. She performed a haunting rendition of Fleetwood Mac’s “Landslide” and a strong cover of “Kathy’s Song”
by Paul Simon. The covers that she prefers to play are Joni Mitchell’s “Case of You,” James Taylor’s “Carolina in
My Mind,” and, of course, “Landslide.” Recognizing the mellow nature of many of the songs in her current repertoire, Kate
has been learning and playing many more upbeat songs.

Also, Kate has been writing her own songs. Given her musical training, she feels she has a talent for crafting
melodies, but sees her biggest obstacle in writing lyrics. As she continues to write, she is becoming more comfortable in
her lyric writing and learning to trust her instincts.

In her own compositions, she derives her inspiration from individuals she knows, relationships she has been in, and relationships she
has seen. Most of her songs are meditations on these things. Her own musical style is influenced by artists such
as Sarah McLachlan, Ani DiFranco, Shawn Colvin, James Taylor, and Joni Mitchell.

The first time Kate performed one of her own songs, she forgot the words. An amateur may have misconstrued such
a mishap as a tragedy, but Kate handled the lyrical slip with grace and humor and continued to perform. As
she continued to play, she found her footing again and finished the song, all the while treating her audience to
an instance of candor and thanking them for their tolerance.

After Davidson, Kate is decidedly undecided about what she may do. She has thought about the possibility of working on
a dude ranch “out West” for the summer or going to work for the National Park Service. As an Economics
major with a Math minor, Kate has enough background to teach math—not out of the realm of possibility for the
aspiring songwriter.

Regardless of where she goes though, Kate will keep playing music because it is an important aspect of her life.
She lives and loves it. And, as part of it, she tries to play every day. Sometime later in November,
Kate Minogue will be playing again at Summit. Such is a treat not to be missed.

**Cheap thrills of current literature: magazines in review**

By Andy Martin
Arts & Living Editor

Students with aTaste for both light reading and wandering musty stacks of our own E.H. Little will surely know that
the library’s collection of periodicals provides a fine, free way to spend an empty afternoon. And being that we stand
just at the beginning of a new month of magazines, it seems a fine time to survey the current crop
of gloss and newsprint—ranging from the typically urbane but often stiff and snotty (New Yorker, Atlantic, et al.), to the
arcane technical (The Association for Computer Machinery’s Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization), to the magnificently crass (US Weekly). Our
own college print culture, you will know from these humble pages, has been revived of late. In addition to this
newspaper, Libertas, and the recently renamed Unspoken Word (formerly Purple Bunnies), Woodrow will soon join the College’s print community. With
so many enjoying writing, printing, and pamphleteering about campus, the cross-section of high and low culture and commentary on the
library’s magazine racks seems a clear point of interest.

So now to the task at hand: reviewing some notable reads and eye-grabbing covers in this November’s crop of periodical
reading. Beginning in the periodical section’s middle ground—National Civic Review to Notices of the American Mathematical Society—your correspondent found it
more than difficult to pass by the bold, red, stylized headline, “Jude, Cad About Town,” on the cover of the
October 25 issue of New York magazine. While the headline promised a juicy day-to-day on star Jude Law’s recent stay
in Manhattan while filming Michael Caine remake “Alfie,” what one finds instead is a fairly cut-and-dry argument on why Jude
Law’s “Alfie” (not Jude Law) is what writer Ariel Levy calls “a strutting, preening, Prada-shoed Manhattan peacock.” So much for
debauchery.

November’s Journal of Popular Culture features, as one would imagine it always does, some high brow treatments of common culture.
“Why ‘The Andy Griffith Show’ is Important to Popular Cultural Studies,” by appropriately named Don Maen, immediately catches one’s eye.
The article’s thesis is that the show is “a nostalgic American popular cultural masterpiece valid for all time.” An admirably
bold claim, indeed; and one close to this heart.

Still in need of something bawdy, your correspondent headed a few rows west—Commentary to Current Contents—where the November issue of
Cosmopolitan smugly sits. From grocery store racks, you will know it is of late a trend for self-help magazines to
quantify their contents by printing covers with the numbers of things a reader can be sure to find inside. Cosmo
does not disappoint: there are “24 Ways to Make Yourself Happier,” “55 Things You Can Learn About Him in 10
Minutes,” and 2,101 “Guys” who “Voted on the Look They Loved.” By your correspondent’s count, these were at least 2,180
reasons to bury a sensory deprived face in the pages of Cosmopolitan for at least an hour or two on
a Tuesday afternoon.

Stephanie Booth’s “55 Things You Can Learn About a Guy in 10 Minutes” proved to be a less than adequate
window into the female mind. Booth and a panel of “relationship-skills coaches” advise women on how to employ “sneaky read-him
tips” to best effect when “you’re curious about the new dude in your life.” Most efficient questions? Booth advises finding
out a favorite sport, how he likes to party, how he deals with traffic, and if he’s left-handed among other
piquant questions for a quick and easy view of his inner soul, etc.

Briefly, one very bright spot in this month’s periodicals is Atlanta magazine’s “Atlanta’s Top 40” which ranks movers and shakers
in the capital of the New South. Andre Benjamin and Antwan Patton of Outkast rank 6th, ahead of Georgia’s governor
and just two spots behind Ted Turner. The estimated influence of the hip-hop duo is due to their having “pushed
Atlanta further into the public eye” and their status as what the magazine calls “this generation’s Beatles.” As much as
anything, the list is a good show of the kind of intracity intrigue that makes for an entertaining and informative
read.
