“Reclining Nude” by Anne Brennan '82

a commons tale

There she crouches
Starship Davidson
coolly calculating
her attack.
Her subtle ploys

to conscript your confidence

are shielded by
the pretentious
uniform of mock -

A Weekend

1

Mountain's breath

clinging, climbing

white against a dawning grey
booted feet crunching

(softly, the cows are sleeping
my breath gasping -
in flatlander’s distress)

2

Last century’s front porch
has seen us before

the cattle watchers

the mountain keepers

the cigar-smoking chair rockers
never rocking

but tilted back

for the proper view

to watch and keep and smoke

3

Firetender

they call me

magic with the flames
(mama taught me)

we burn together,
fire and I

4

Warming ourselves
in each other's talk
Mountain

we call ourselves
for the weekend

5

Soaking up the flavor

of the mountain’s breath
and tasting

of her life.
