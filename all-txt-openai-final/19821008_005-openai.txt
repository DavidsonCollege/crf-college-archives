**SAT Scores on the Rise**

CPS—Standardized test scores for college-bound seniors rose again after a 19-year decline, but educators are still uncertain what caused the two-decade decline or why this year’s scores suddenly went up.

When test scores leveled out one year ago, experts were hopeful then that it signaled an upturn in the long-running decline, but few were ready to predict scores would increase this year.

Yet performances on a variety of standardized tests—the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), the Test of Standard Written English, and the 15-subject College Board Achievement Tests—indicate test scores may finally be on the path to recovery, the College Board reports.

“This year’s rise, combined with last year’s holding steady, is a welcome sign for educators, parents, and students that serious efforts by the nation’s schools and their students to improve the quality of education are taking effect,” says George Hanford, president of the College Board.

Hanford remains non-committal, however, on whether the rise is an ongoing trend or only a temporary interruption in the test score decline which began in 1963.

“There are several signs we think are encouraging,” notes Fred Moreno, spokesman for College Board. “Teachers have been reporting for some time that students are more interested in academic subjects and in good grades. And we know that the class of ’82 had more math and physical science courses than ever before. Since most of the tests deal with these subjects, we think students were better prepared to answer the questions in these areas.”

Schools have also “tightened up in terms of basic academics,” says Dr. Larry Loesch, president of the Association for Measurement and Evaluation in Guidance.

“I think there’s a growing emphasis on traditional academics—math, science, and English—from the ‘back to basics’ movement,” Loesch says. “In the ’60s and ’70s, we had a more liberal attitude towards education. But as times have gotten tougher we’ve moved back to traditional courses.”

Indeed, a recent study from the University of Iowa noted that in larger high schools where more traditional courses were offered, students also scored higher on standardized tests such as the SAT.

**U.S. Arboretum Director to Visit**

United States National Arboretum Director Dr. Marc Cathey will visit Davidson College on 12 October to present a slide show and lecture titled, “A Capital Experience,” which begins at 8:15 p.m. in Love Auditorium.

During his visit, Cathey will also give the College 1,000 seeds from Japan’s famed Yoshino cherry trees.

The seeds—the first to be distributed by Cathey and his staff—are part of a gift of one million such seeds gathered last summer by Japanese schoolchildren. He plans to distribute the seeds from Michigan to Northern Florida. In return, Cathey has asked American schoolchildren to collect a million dogwood seeds this fall to be sent to Japan.

The cherry trees will begin to bloom in three or four years and will reach full maturity in eighteen to twenty years.

A native of Davidson, Cathey attended Davidson College and graduated from N.C. State University. He holds master’s and doctoral degrees from Cornell University and joined USDA as a research horticulturist in 1956. Cathey is well known for his televised horticultural presentations and has been a frequent guest on NBC’s “Today Show.”

**Students Polled on Scheduling**

This survey of Davidson’s student population was conducted on Tuesday and Wednesday, 5 and 6 October. The respondents were called at random and given this question: “Which of the following academic systems would you prefer?”

The choices were the following:

1) The present term system.
2) A quarter system with the first quarter going from September to December, second quarter from January to March, and the final quarter from March to June.
3) The semester system with first semester from September to January and second semester from January to late May.
4) The semester system with first semester from late August to December and the second semester from January to late May (The Semester Planning proposal).
5) The final option of a 4-1-4 system with January as a month with special programs.
