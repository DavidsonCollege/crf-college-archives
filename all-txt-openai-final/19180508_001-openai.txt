Dr. J. H. Henderlite Talks at Y. M. C. A.
“Other Side of Road” is Subject of Helpful Address.

Dr. J. H. Henderlite, of Gastonia, N. C., addressed the last regular meeting of the Y. M. C. A., on
Thursday evening. He chose as his subject, “The Other Side of the Road,” as is brought out in the parable
of the Good Samaritan. He contrasted the two sides of the road of life; the one a smooth and long
road followed by the sinful, the other side marked by rough obstacles of self-sacrifice and oftentimes short-lived, yet always pursued
by the righteous. “The Levite and the priest passed by on the other side, although it was plainly their duty
to render assistance to the wounded man, as their vows exhorted them to aid the sick and distressed. On the
other hand, it was not supposed that a Samaritan should aid a Jew, for he was of a despised race,
yet through motives of kindness for humanity he helped the wounded man. Dr. Henderlite compared us with the Good Samaritan,
and showed that it was plainly America’s duty to rescue the fallen nations of the world. Bleeding Belgium and Serbia
were calling for us and we heeded the call. This talk was indeed uplifting, giving us a new perspective of
our situation in the world’s war.

STUDENT BODY ELECTIONS.

At a meeting of the student body last Monday morning the following men were elected as officers for the coming
scholastic year: J. W. McAlister, president; A. D. McArn and Wm. Love, vice-presidents, and L. B. Schenck, secretary and treasurer.
The elections were spirited throughout and it required several ballots to decide on the winning men. Those who were elected,
it is confidently felt, will prove efficient officers, and student government for the coming year promises to be as great
a success as this. G. D. Elliott, H. B. Brown and W. F. Hall, Jr., were elected to be assistant
business managers for next year’s Annual. J. J. Love has already been elected business manager. The election of president of
the Athletic association, the class officers, the editor of the Magazine and the Annual will be held some time this
week.

CONFERENCE HELD BY Y. M. C. A. CABINET

A conference of all of the committees and officers of the Davidson Y. M. C. A. was held on Wednesday,
May 1, in the new gymnasium. Mr. J. W. Bergthold, Interstate Student Secretary of the Y. M. C. A., led
the conference and gave some very valuable suggestions. After a short round-table discussion, policies were drawn up by the various
committees for next year. With the earnest cooperation of the student body and the successful carrying out of the policies
outlined, next year will be a record one for the Y. M. C. A.

No. 30 Wildcats Win State Track Meet With Ease
Team Wins 55 Out of a Possible 130 Points---Grey Stars

Davidson won in the State track meet held Saturday on Emerson field, at Chapel Hill, by scoring 55 out of
a possible 130 points. Carolina took second place with 31 1-3 points; Trinity third place, with 25 1-3 points, and
Elon fourth place, with 8 1-3 points. “Wooly” Grey was easily the star of the meet. Brand was in splendid
form, lowering his former record of the mile by several seconds. He did not show up so well in the
two mile, owing to the fact that it was run just after the mile race, and he was not in
the best condition. Murray showed us something new, a Freshman winning his “D” the first trial. He won the broad
jump, jumping 20 feet, 10 inches. McQueen was up to his usual pace, easily winning the high jump. Crouch also
was “going good” in taking the 440. But after all, we again look back upon our old “standback” “Wooly.” He
is always there with the “stuff,” when it comes to handling the weights. With his equipment of brawn and muscle,
he always goes “over the top” with the honors in his line. It might also be mentioned that he led
in individual points scored. Davidson won seven first places. The following is the score by events:

100-yard dash, Wood, Carolina, Thompson, Trinity, time 11 seconds; 440-yard dash, Crouch, Davidson, Finley, Davidson, time 53 2-5 seconds; one-mile
run, Brand, Davidson, Smathers, Trinity, time 4 minutes 42 seconds; high hurdles, Finley, Davidson, Grandin, Carolina; 220-yard dash, Stephens, Elon,
Wood, Carolina, time 24.3 seconds; 2-mile run, Loftin, Trinity, Brand, Davidson, time 10 minutes 5 seconds; 880-yard run, Louis, captain,
Trinity, Crouch, Davidson, time 2 minutes; high jump, McQueen, Davidson, with Lynch, Carolina, and Cranford, Trinity, tying for second place,
height 5 feet 7 inches; shot put, Grey, Davidson, Grandin, Carolina, 38 feet 3 inches; pole vault, Travis, Carolina, Spencer,
Carolina, 10 feet; discus, Grey, Davidson, Corpening, Carolina, 108 feet 9 inches; broad jump, Murray, Davidson, Hatcher, Carolina, 20 feet
10 inches.
