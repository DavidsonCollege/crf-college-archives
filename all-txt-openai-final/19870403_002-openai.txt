El Salvador fighting claims first American life

By KATHERINE PRICE

Headlining events for March 27-April 2:

Around the World—The first American death in the El Salvador struggle occurred on Tuesday. Army Sergeant Gregory Allen Fronius, 27, was killed while reportedly defending himself in combat. Elsewhere in Central America, reports claim that the C.I.A. has been parachuting contra troops into Nicaragua. While the contras have been using C.I.A. intelligence data, the C.I.A. asserts that no U.S. employees are active in Nicaraguan operations.

British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher met with Soviet leader Gorbachev in Moscow to discuss arms control, but reported little progress. Acting as a U.S./Soviet mediator for the first time, Thatcher proposed that the superpowers set a timetable for space defense systems.Research. Thatcher’s visit to Moscow coincided with British opposition Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock’s visit to Washington. The Labor Party accused the White House of distorting the talks. Thatcher and Kinnock will compete in upcoming elections. Afghanistan bombed Pakistan again, raising the number of people killed to 94. President Reagan described the arms-for-hostages affair with Iran as “like paying ransom to a kidnapper” to a sixth-grade girl. Two Marines, who had served as guards at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, were accused of permitting Soviet access to sensitive U.S. intelligence and communications information. One of the Marines, Sergeant Clayton Lonetree, gave conflicting stories which involved an affair with a female Soviet agent. The State Department recalled all Marines from the embassy. U.S. officials expressed fear that U.S. security might be compromised when Secretary of State Shultz meets with Foreign Minister Shevardnadze in Moscow. In response, Pakistan downed an Afghan warplane on Monday. Afghans claimed the plane was a civilian airliner.

Chad reported its recapture of the northern stronghold of Faya Largeau from Libya. Libya, under the leadership of Qaddafi, had occupied northern Chad for the past three years. The Chadian victory was welcomed by the Reagan administration, which had supported $15 million in U.S. aid to Chad. Pope John Paul II, in a visit to Chile, criticized the 13-year reign of General Pinochet as “dictatorial,” and encouraged Roman Catholic support for democratic reform. Kuwait rejected a recent U.S. offer of naval protection in the Persian Gulf, fearing the consequences of such a large naval presence.

Across the Nation — President Reagan vetoed a highway bill of $87.5 million on Friday, and began seeking congressional support. The House voted 350-73 to override Reagan’s veto, but the Senate narrowly failed to override the veto. Senate Democrats quickly moved to force a second vote. Democratic Senator Terry Sanford of N.C. became the object of attention as the only Democrat to vote to sustain the veto. He has since said he will change his vote, placing Senate Republicans in a desperate quest for one more vote.

In a tremendous victory for affirmative action advocates, the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that employees can hire women and minorities over other applicants if all qualifications are considered. The suit involved Diane Joyce, who had been hired over a white male with slightly higher test scores. The vote signaled a loss for the Reagan administration’s six-year war against affirmative action. Surrogate mother Mary Beth Whitehead lost custody of her child “Baby M” to William Stern. NJ. Superior Court Judge Harvey Sorkow presided over the case, which was dubbed a landmark decision.

Evangelist Jim Bakker, who left the PTL empire amid scandal last week, offered his resignation to the Assemblies of God. Bakker has been accused of having a sexual encounter in 1980. He claims that rival evangelist Jimmy Swaggart was trying to subvert his ministry.

In Economic News — The U.S., angry at Japanese trading practices, retaliated with trade restrictions on Japanese electronic products. The trade measures will double import prices from Japan. The U.S. action follows Japanese failure to comply with a semiconductor agreement between the two countries. Reportedly, U.S. patience with Japan ended with a Japanese refusal to purchase U.S. supercomputers. Following the announcement of the economic sanctions, Japan may reconsider purchasing the supercomputers. In a related story, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped significantly on Monday, by 57.39 points — the third largest drop in history. The stock plunge followed a rapid devaluation of the dollar and economists’ predictions about the negative effects of a U.S./Japan trade war.
