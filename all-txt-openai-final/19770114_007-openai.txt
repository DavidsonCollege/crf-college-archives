The Davidsonian

Key Problem Named

[Continued from page 6]

"...that they are very hard to do well without considerable sponsor supervision," said Kelton. Kelton admitted that eliminating Extended Studies
would restrict the opportunities of freshmen who come to Davidson with an intensive background in some area and want to
pursue it immediately. "I can see how a student with, say, four or five years of a language would be
capable of handling an Extended Study in the literature of that language or some other special area. And without Extended
Studies, the sophomore with a good grounding in a discipline would not be able to explore an area of particular
interest to him. But these exceptional students don’t receive the attention they deserve under the present Extended Studies setup."

"In psychology, our five instructors work with five or six juniors and as many seniors in independent study programs—they have
that many commitments before even considering Extended Studies for freshmen or sophomores. Extended Studies are an extra course load for
a faculty member who will naturally give more careful attention to majors and their independent studies work. I haven’t committed
myself yet, but if I were to vote now I would go along with a proposal to restrict Extended Studies,"
concluded Kelton.

Professor of English Gil Holland was in favor of keeping the Extended Studies Program. He commented, "I think it’s been
very successful myself. I hope they keep it, mainly because of the writing in my own case. I’ve had good
luck with students in improving their expository writing. Some students have also done some reading in interest areas along with
their writing." Holland also saw the drawbacks of the Extended Studies program, "Some members are just drowned in independent study.
I think that’s the problem. We all have other independent study programs." In spite of these disadvantages, Holland said, "I'd
hate to see the students lose that opportunity (Extended Studies)."

"I have very limited experience with Extended Studies," admitted Professor of Religion Gordon E. Michaelson, "but basically I’m in favor
of anything in the curriculum that provides for student experimentation, things that don’t fit neatly into a course. A college
like this can afford to be pluralistic in its academic interest. I realize there are problems—my anxiety is simply over
accommodating a wide variety of student interest."

"I am in favor of Extended Studies—it provides a good arrangement of options and gives us flexibility we would not
otherwise have," said Professor of Biology Don Kimmel. "Students earn biology credit in Extended Studies just as they do in
the required Independent Studies program. Biology is a research science, and we want as many as we can handle to
sign up for independent research. About half the time students will do research for a faculty member. The rest of
the projects the student and faculty member work up together. Extended and independent research can provide good career and experiential
opportunities, like the hospital program we have some sophomores in. It also allows pre-meds to get into depth, gives them
an idea of what research is like. If the faculty votes to abolish Extended Studies, our department would reinstitute a
departmental requirement, with a different name but the same purpose, that would give us the same flexibility."

Extended Studies, in the eyes of most freshmen, looms above as a rather hazy plan for independent study, something used
to fill a third hole, or in the face of other demanding courses, as a good "balance" to save sanity.
What many freshmen do not realize is that an Extended Study is not an easy way out, but rather a
viable alternative to the limited course offerings that come with a small college. Something is missing, for there is a
conspicuous lack of information about what Extended Studies really are, as well as how to plan one, who to see
about it, and what is involved in exploring areas of interest that are not offered in a specific course at
Davidson. Misconceptions range from total ignorance, to thinking that an Extended Study is taking a regularly offered course independently, to
the horrifying thought that one must decide a major before being able to take an Extended Study.

Communication hurts Extended Studies

Freshmen are just not told. In looking back, Extended Studies are overlooked in the rush of pre-registration, the confusion of
even thinking of course requirements, and the entire process of adjusting to the joys and tribulations of first and second
term. It is ignored at orientation, the hall counselors must only go by their impressions, and the college catalog is
forgotten in the shuffle. Now the EPC is examining Extended Studies. One of the arguments against Extended Studies is that
some have become "shoddy, irresponsible projects." They have not given us the chance. Although it is our responsibility to plan
our course schedule, we are freshmen and need to be told. In this respect, the faculty and administration have failed,
for it is only by knowing what they envision and expect from any Extended Studies program are we able to
look at and achieve from Extended Studies what will...th enrich our courses here and satisfy the faculty in that the
credit received is actually deserved.

**Interview**

**Epes speaks for Extended Studies**

**Davidsonian:** When did you first assume the position of director of Extended Studies?

**Epes:** Two and a half years ago, after the Extended Studies Program became optional.

**D:** How were you chosen for the position?

**E:** It was an accident. Dr. Bevan was sorry to do it. Knowing he would not have the time for
it, I volunteered. At the time, I thought it would be for only six months.

**D:** Why do you think Davidson needs it?

**E:** It provides some opportunities that I don’t think would be otherwise available. Some of the things it does could
be provided for through the departments. It is also psychologically useful to know that the routine of three classes can
be broken.

**D:** If handled by the departments, would it be independent studies?

**E:** I assume so.

**D:** What do you look for in an Extended Studies project?

**E:** What I like to see most is something different, something substantial, and most of all, something interesting.

**D:** Why would you turn down a project?

**E:** I rarely have that option. The area chairmen do that.

**D:** What would the reasons be for rejecting a project?

**E:** There are two chief reasons. One would be weaknesses in the evaluation procedure, and the second would be something
that appears, at least on the surface, to be frivolous.

**D:** Can you tell after the effect when a project has been accepted but should not have been?

**E:** Not always, of course. But I do get feedback from a sponsor. Occasionally, I get feedback from other students.
I depend on the “Rumor Mill.” I’m in the position to know better than anybody.

**D:** Why are you in that position?

**E:** I see all the contracts; I talk to the area chairmen. And I’m sufficiently associated with the program to
hear the rumors.

**D:** I have heard three oppositions to the program. The first is financial. How do you answer this opposition?

**E:** Both Dean Johnston and I agree that finances are simply not a major point of opposition.

**D:** The second argument is that the program takes up too much faculty time.

**E:** It’s asserted that to do the program right requires a fair amount of time. I agree. I don’t think
it takes as much time as some people believe. After all, the work should be mainly independent work on the
student’s part. My reservation is, to use economic terms, what’s the trade-off? If we save that time, for what else
will it be used?

**D:** Can you think of a way to alleviate some of the burden of time?

**E:** One way that would help would be to put a ceiling of three projects a year on every faculty
member and enforce it. That ceiling would, oddly enough, allow us to operate at the level we operated last year.

**D:** The last argument is that some of the past Extended Studies Programs have been shoddy.

**E:** Sometimes it is, and sometimes it isn’t. When it is good, I think it is excellent. Moreover, I don’t
think Extended Studies has a patent on shoddy or excellent work. I think, however, the spread between shoddy and excellent
is greater.

**D:** But you think the good outweighs the bad?

**E:** Yes. And I would include among the good the opportunity to do something outside the classroom. Students can do
this in seminars, but Extended Studies assures the opportunity for everyone.

**D:** What do you see as the directions which Extended Studies might take?

**E:** I foresee two options. We could keep it, or we could get rid of it. In the latter case,
I can see one alternative: the assurance that each department offers independent study for members of each of the four
classes.

**D:** Why would that option be less desirable than the present program of Extended Studies?

**E:** A department would almost necessarily tend to give preference to majors, I think. The second reservation I have is
that when we put everything in departmental pigeonholes, we miss a lot of stuff that falls in between the cracks.
And let me add one advantage to the option. Extended Studies as it stands is open only to freshmen and
sophomores. This option would open the concept to juniors and seniors.

**D:** What about the other direction? What will happen to the quality of education if Extended Studies is abolished?

**E:** The school would survive. It just wouldn’t be quite the same.

**D:** We've talked about what the students gain from the program. What do the faculty members stand to gain from
it, if anything?

**E:** I think in some cases the faculty dovetails Extended Studies projects into their own research. Of course, the same
thing happens in departmental independent studies as well. There are times I've seen a faculty member sponsor a project which
they know only a little about but want to find out more. That’s fun for me to see. There are
lists of projects that they are not only willing to do but really want to.

**D:** Have you any other comment on the subject?

**E:** Only to say that we know it’s a high-risk program, and I’m willing to take the risks.
