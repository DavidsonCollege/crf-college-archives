Question of the Week

Although Homecoming dances are far in the past, the campus is the scene of many a discussion on Mid-Winters. Since
this is the case, the question for this week is: “What type of band do you prefer for Mid-Winters and
do you have any preference among the current hit bands?”

Bill Perdew, Senior: Personally, I prefer a name band, of course, that is versatile enough to play good swing and
good sweet music; for a combination of both satisfies both types of dancers and adds necessary variety. One who is
a good master of ceremonies can add considerable color, get things off to a quicker start, and will then turn
the dances into a success. All this leads to one suggestion, Glenn Miller. He’s a combination of the best and
would make this Mid-Winters the most outstanding yet.

Billy Masters, Senior: With the number of top bands in the country, I think that one could be easily obtained
which can play both swing and sweet, with emphasis on the sweet. Glenn Miller would fit in perfectly. I think
Kay Kyser would put on the best show, but for dancing, Miller by all means, with Kyser or Jan Garber
as second choice.

Bill Bolin, Senior: Jan Garber or Will Osborn are my two choices for Mid-Winter dances. In my opinion, either band
will be an excellent one for our dances. I'm looking forward to these dances and I hope that they are
the best ever.

Miller Sproull, Junior: I prefer a versatile band with both sweet and swing arrangements. Glenn Miller would come nearer to
fulfilling the requirements or fulfill them as well as any band that I know. If we get a band that
strictly swings, many will be dissatisfied; if we get a band that only plays slow sweet music, many will be
dissatisfied. Why not get Miller, who can do both?

Winston Taylor, Junior: I prefer a sweet swing band for Mid-Winters, playing about three slow pieces for each fast one.
My first choice would be Glenn Miller, with Charlie Barnet and Hal Kemp following in order. I would prefer one
large band for the whole set even at a higher price.

Elmer Knoeller, Sophomore: Preferably, I would choose a band that dealt especially with sweet music, something on the order of
Glenn Miller or Tommy Dorsey. Last year we had two bands for the dances. This year, I would recommend one
good big name band for the whole set, even if it meant an additional dollar or two.

“Porkie” Woodward, Sophomore: By all means a big name band. I think the plan last year was fine, but I
believe that it would be better to have one band for the whole set. I prefer a smooth sweet band
with variety. Glenn Miller is my choice for a better set of dances, and under the present conditions, I should
think that he would be better from the Pan-Hellenic standpoint.

Joe Barnwell, Freshman: Though a freshman may be somewhat hesitant to voice an opinion in such a matter, I would
like to express my preference for the Mid-Winter’s band. We would all agree that a band that is versatile enough
to “send” even the most enthusiastic jitterbugs and at the same time please the smooth dancers would be an intelligent
choice. Charlie Barnet’s band of recent popularity is well qualified for both styles of playing without the least bit of
“corn,” and therefore receives my vote for the delightful Mid-Winter dances.

Hector MacLean, Junior: Yup! I am in favor of getting one of the good Hawaiian bands to lay us an
illusion of blue moonlight and the beach at Waikiki for Mid-Winters. I am against the idea of having a band
that only swings or only plays slow sweet music. I think that only a native outfit can provide that mellow
background which is so conducive to a successful weekend. After all, the dances are not really the integral part of
the weekend but merely form a background for introductions and trivialities. There are any number of such garland-bedecked organizations touring
the countryside and I think the Council could secure one of the best with no great exertion on their part.

Dr. Foreman Praises Old War Drama “Journey’s End” to be Presented Soon by Red and Black Masquers

Reverend John Melton returned to the campus Tuesday. Reverend John Melton led Sunday Vespers. Sigma Upsilon Taps Six Men in
Special Chapel Program. St. Paul’s Benediction Taken as Theme of Rome, Georgia, Pastor.

Dr. Kenneth J. Foreman of the Davidson College faculty, a veteran of the last World War and the chaplain of
the local post of the American Legion, has reviewed the drama “Journey’s End” to be presented soon by the Red
and Black Masquers, who plan to stage the play here within the next few weeks.

Reviews Play

Dr. Foreman's review is as follows: “Journey's End is a powerful anti-war play, though not one word is said against
war from the first to the last. We are simply shown, without comment, what comes of the lives of ordinary
decent or above-average young men, the kind one sees on the campus for example, at their journey's end in the
trenches. Even in the expurgated version allowed by local regulations, the effect should be strong and sobering. War is reduced
to its simplest, its final terms; not as a conflict of ideologies, not as a game of strategy, but as
a destroyer of whatever normal people have called good—futile, inescapable, final. Those who wish merely an evening’s entertainment, and above
all, children, should not be invited to see this play. But for those who do not resent bitterness if it
leads to wholesome reflection, seeing this play may be a valuable experience.”

Musical Vespers

The date of the presentation of the play will be announced sometime next week, according to Ken McIntyre, president of
the Masquers. He stated further that the play was coming along well and rapidly rounding into shape.

The Eumenean Literary Society, at its bi-weekly meeting held Tuesday night, November 14, in Eu Hall, discussed measures to enforce
abstinence regulations and the collection of dues.

President Walter Lee Lingle returned from a trip to Rome, Ga., where he filled two speaking engagements. Dr. Lingle conducted
both the morning and evening services in the First Presbyterian Church of Rome, Ga.

Four members of the Sophomore class are working on regular “Y” deputations this year. The boys are Fain, McKinnon, Summers,
and Whitten, helping pastors in church work.Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:
